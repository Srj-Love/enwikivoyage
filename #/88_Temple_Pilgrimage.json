Among his many achievements, he is said to have created the ",{"type":"''","value":["kana"]}," syllabary, brought the tantric teachings of Esoteric Buddhism from China, developed it into the uniquely Japanese Shingon sect, and founded Shingon's headquarters on ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mount Koya"]]}," near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Osaka"]]},".\n\nWhile most modern-day pilgrims (an estimated 100,000 yearly) travel by tour bus, a small minority still set out the old-fashioned way on foot, a journey which takes about six weeks to complete.  Pilgrims, known as ",{"type":"''","value":["o-henro-san"]}," (お遍路さん), can be spotted in the temples and roadsides of Shikoku clad in a white jacket emblazoned with the characters ",{"type":"''","value":["Dōgyō Ninin"]}," (同行二人), meaning \"two traveling together\" — the other traveler being the spirit of Kobo Daishi.\n\nLocals will be excited to see someone making the journey on foot, and priests will be relieved that you are not showing up with 100 of your close friends.

All of these items can be purchased -in a formal sense- at Mount Koya or at Ryozenji, the first temple.\n\nIt should be noted that many pilgrims who begin the pilgrimage on foot do not finish it. It is a common to hear of people giving up in Kochi, traditionally known as \"devil's land\" because of its hot temperature, intense rain, and infrequent contact with civilization. (This means you must either camp, sleep in a rest stop or precisely time your journey to only hit towns and be willing to pay up for a hotel room.)\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nIt is traditional to prepare by visiting ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mount Koya"]]},", but the route itself starts at Ryōzenji, near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tokushima"]]},", and you have to return here in order to complete your pilgrimage. It is not necessary to start at temple #1 as long as you visit them all, but this is by far the most popular starting point for pilgrims from outside Shikoku, because it is also the closest to people coming from Mt. Koya.　\n\nThe temples are usually visited in clockwise order, although this too, is just a convention — in practice, as all signs are oriented for pilgrims going clockwise, it's easier to get lost if you try to go against the flow.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go"]},"\nMost pilgrims walking on foot average around 25 km daily and complete the trip in five to seven weeks.\n\nThe canonical list of temples is as follows:\n\n",{"type":"{|","value":[["table border=\"0\" cellpadding=0 cellspacing=5"],["|- bgcolor=#eeeeee"],["!
