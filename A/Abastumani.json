Today it sits quiet for most of the year waiting for the summer rush of Georgian tourists who come to breathe it's clean air and walk in the pristine forests.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nAbastumani is reached by either taxi or marshutka(mini-bus) from the Akhaltsikhe bus station. The drive takes approximately 30 minutes in a taxi or around 50 minutes in the marshutka depending on how many stops it makes.\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe lower town is 7km from one end to the other and relatively flat so it is easily walkable. The observatory is 4km above the town. To reach it you can either take a cable car which has a sporadic schedule, or walk one hour up a trail or a little longer by road.\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThere are many wooden, mostly abandoned, Czarist era buildings to view and photograph. Visit the Czar's Bath that is now under renovation but the guard will probably let you look around. Ride up the cable car and walk around the surreal and seemingly abandoned astrophysical observatory complex. The Romanov palace complex was probably once a great site but it barely warrants the walk out of town to visit them. Of the three original buildings only one remains in its former state and lies fenced off, without any windows and is slowly deteriorating. Several years ago one building caught fire and is currently being rebuilt and the main house was sold to private owners who have altered the original appearance beyond recognition.\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Forest Walk"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Walk in the dark forest surrounding the observatory and look for animals such as bear and wolves."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Astrophysical Observatory"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Visit the astrophysical observatory and look at the stars and moon through the old telescopes.
