It is a harbour city located on Scotland's north-east coast, approximately 120 miles (190 km) north of Edinburgh and 400 miles (650 km) north of London, where the Rivers Dee and Don meet the North Sea. It is an important sea port, regional centre, and the hub of the North Sea oil industry.\n\nAlthough remote by UK standards, this is no backwater; Aberdeen is a prosperous and cosmopolitan city (partly due to North Sea oil) and is characterised by its grand and ornate architecture. Most buildings are constructed out of granite quarried in and around the city, and as a result, Aberdeen is often referred to as ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Granite City"]},". It is also known for its many outstanding parks, gardens and floral displays throughout the city, as well as its long, sandy beach. Aberdeen also boasts the title of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Oil Capital of Europe"]}," and has been voted in several polls as the happiest place in Britain, with a 2006 poll citing access to large areas of greenery and community spirit. It has won the Britain in Bloom competition 10 times.\n\nAberdeen does not attract as many tourists as other Scottish destinations such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Edinburgh"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["St Andrews"]]},", and can feel more authentic. It is a great place to stop for a couple of days on a tour of Scotland, and especially good as a base for exploring the wider region to take advantage of the castles, golf, whisky distilleries, scenery, mountains (including skiing and snowboarding), coast and other attractions in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Aberdeenshire"]]}," and Royal Deeside. Alternatively, Aberdeen's remoteness yet comforts and cosmopolitan nature makes it an interesting destination for a short city break if you really want to get away from the stress.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Aberdeen Town House A.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["250px"],["Busy day outside the Town House (i.e. city hall) on Union Street"]]},"\nAberdeen is a city of 220,000 people - smaller than ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Glasgow"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Edinburgh"]]},", but larger than other Scottish cities. By UK and even Scottish standards it is remote and often the subject of \"far away\" jokes (the nearest city is much smaller ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dundee"]]}," 70 miles away). Despite this, Aberdeen is surprisingly easy to reach and is a modern and prosperous city. British visitors are often surprised to find a such a vibrant city so far north. Partly due to oil wealth and its status as the only large regional centre, it has the facilities of a much larger city. Together, all this gives Aberdeen an air of self-sufficiency found in few places in Britain today.\n\nAberdeen is one of the most prosperous places in Scotland, due primarily to the ",{"type":"'''","value":["North Sea oil"]}," industry, and has low unemployment (just over 2% in February 2012), leading to a low crime rate compared to other UK cities. Immigration due to the oil industry and the universities gives the city a cosmopolitan air that often surprises visitors, and when out and about in the city languages are heard from all over the world.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Orientation"]},"\n\nAberdeen has a seemingly-random mediaeval layout common for cities in Britain. The city-centre is divided by the mile-long ",{"type":"'''","value":["Union Street"]}," which runs north-east\/south-west (named after the 1800 \"union\" between Great Britain and Ireland). At the north-east end is the main square -  the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Castlegate"]}," - while leading off Union Street are important roads such as (east to west) Broad Street, Shiprow, Market Street, St. Nicholas Square, and Union Terrace. The ",{"type":"'''","value":["Tourist Information Centre"]}," is located on Union Street, at the corner with the Shiprow. Running parallel to Union Street are Guild Street (where the railway and bus stations are located) and Upperkirkgate, which leads into Schoolhill. East of the Castlegate, roads lead to the ",{"type":"'''","value":["beach"]}," and the sea, while at the other end of Union Street, roads lead to the West End (where many millionnaires live). Unusually, the ",{"type":"'''","value":["harbour is in the city centre"]}," and is rapidly reached from the Shiprow, Market Street, Guild Street and Marischal Street. The River Dee does not flow through the city centre but a little to the south. The River Don flows through the north of the city, about two miles (3.2 km) north of the city centre.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Background"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Victoria Park, crocuses.jpg"],["thumb"],["Crocuses at Victoria Park"]]},"\nWhile the location has been inhabited for over 8000 years, a city did not develop until the middle-ages. The modern city was formed by two settlements which grew together  - Old Aberdeen close to the mouth of the River Don (home to the University since 1495), and New Aberdeen, about two miles south where a stream, the Denburn, met the River Dee (the Denburn is long built-over by a road and railway but its route is crossed by bridge on Union Street).\n\nMuch of the city's prosperity came from the sea and its harbour - until the mid-20th century fishing and mercantile trading were mainstays of the economy, along with granite quarrying and carving, local agriculture and manufacturing (e.g. paper and cloth). Then, these industries declined while Aberdeen's location made it perfect as the main base for North Sea oil. Today, most people work for one of the many oil-related companies or know someone who does, and these jobs are well-paid. Many work offshore on the North Sea platforms and commute for shifts of two weeks or so by ",{"type":"'''","value":["helicopter"]},", which are conspicuous in the city's skies. However, a section of the population did not benefit from North Sea oil and still experiences poverty and deprivation. Aberdeen also has one of the oldest universities in Europe (founded 1495) and its two universities today have a total of 30,000 students.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Schoolhill, Aberdeen.JPG"],["thumb"],["right"],["250px"],["Granite buildings at Schoolhill, Aberdeen. Domed building in foreground was constructed in 1901 as the Aberdeen Academy school; today it houses the Academy Shopping Centre, with Jack Wills clothing store under the dome."]]},"\n\nDuring the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries, growing prosperity led to grand civil engineering projects, including Union Street (much of which is actually bridge) and the construction of many large and ornate buildings. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Grand architecture"]}," is one of the city's distinctive features, particularly Neoclassical, Gothic Revival and Scottish Baronial styles. The mediaeval buildings had been made of wood, and following several disastrous fires, the city's leaders resolved to rebuild only in stone. The local stone they had, quarried in the city and throughout Aberdeenshire, was ",{"type":"'''","value":["granite"]},". Nearly all pre-1960s buildings are made of this and sparkle in the sun, giving the city's other name, ",{"type":"'''","value":["\"The Granite City\""]},".\n\nAs technology improved, granite could be worked more cheaply, allowing later buildings to have ever more ornately-carved stonework such as at ",{"type":"'''","value":["Marischal College"]}," (pronounced like \"Marshall\"). Granite began to be exported by sea, particularly to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]}," where many buildings are constructed of Aberdeen or Aberdeenshire granite (e.g. the fountains at Trafalgar Square). However, highly-carved granite was still expensive and demonstrated the owner's success and status, with side and rear walls left in cheaper, unworked stone as in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bath"]]},". Many of these buildings (particularly in the city centre) are now in need of restoration and have an air of faded grandeur. Buildings are no longer constructed in granite but it is still used extensively as a facing material and granite chippings are heavily used in the concrete of modern buildings (which makes Aberdeen concrete also sparkle in the sunlight).\n\nAfter the discovery of ",{"type":"'''","value":["North Sea oil"]}," in the 1960s, the city grew from an elegant but declining backwater dependent on fishing, to a thriving centre of the energy industry. Today, in addition to the growing population, large numbers commute to Aberdeen from exurbs and outlying towns, with heavy traffic at rush hour. Despite this, some areas of the city retain the feel of a village. Perhaps the best examples of this are the line of suburbs stretching towards Royal Deeside, including Cults and Peterculter.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Read"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Johnston Gardens - bridge.jpg"],["thumb"],["Johnston Gardens"]]},"\nLewis Grassic Gibbon's trio of novels tell the story of a young woman, Chris Guthrie, growing up and living in the north-east of Scotland. The first, ",{"type":"''","value":["Sunset Song"]}," (1932) tells her story of growing up in a rural area just south of Aberdeen, at a time of change in society and the rural way of life. ",{"type":"''","value":["Sunset Song"]}," is regarded as one of the most important Scottish novels of the 20th century and many Aberdonians have studied it in school. The other works of the trilogy are ",{"type":"''","value":["Cloud Howe"]}," (1933) and ",{"type":"''","value":["Grey Granite"]}," (1934), which feature her life continuing in a north-east city that may or may not be Aberdeen.\n\nNumerous crime novels by Scottish author Stuart MacBride are set in Aberdeen. His best-selling thrillers featuring Detective Sergeant Logan McRae portray a fictional darker side of the city and its environs, but make frequent reference to real-life city locations. These include ",{"type":"''","value":["Cold Granite"]}," (2005), ",{"type":"''","value":["Dying Light"]}," (2006), ",{"type":"''","value":["Blind Eye"]}," (2009) and ",{"type":"''","value":["Shatter the Bones"]}," (2011). These novels often feature prominently in bookstore displays in the city.\n\nIf you are interested in books about Aberdeen or by local writers, call into a Waterstone's bookstore (two branches on Union Street, one in the Trinity Shopping Centre) or WH Smith (in the St. Nicholas Centre). Each store has a local interest section with a surprising range of relevant books about Aberdeen and life in the city; the section in Waterstone's at the western end of Union Street is particularly well-stocked. Also, the city's public Central Library on Rosemount Viaduct has a local section and is free for all to browse.\n\nTwo local daily newspapers serve Aberdeen: the tabloid ",{"type":"'''","value":["Evening Express"]}," and the more serious ",{"type":"'''","value":["Press & Journal"]}," (often referred to by Aberdonians as the \"P&J\", it also publishes editions specific to other areas in the North of Scotland). There is an urban legend that the Press & Journal once ran the headline, \"",{"type":"''","value":["Aberdeen Man Lost at Sea"]},"\". It was April 1912 and the story referred to the sinking of the ",{"type":"''","value":["Titanic"]},". Whether this is true or not, reading these can give an interesting angle on developments and life in the city and surrounding towns.

Days are equally often sunny and cloudy, but strong, biting winds off the North Sea are common and it can feel bitterly cold even in the sun.

Most of the festivals occur in summer and it's also the best time to visit attractions in the surrounding region. Alternatively, late spring and early autumn are also good times to visit.

However, the local dialect is called ",{"type":"'''","value":["Doric"]},", now spoken primarily by middle-aged and older people and those from lower social classes. Doric can be more confusing at first than other Scottish dialects.

There is a huge ecosystem of oil companies, ranging from small operations to multinationals, that provide services of all sorts for the oil industry on a contract basis.

Aberdeen is indicated on direction signs on all these roads, and when you reach the boundary of the city, direction signs also direct you to the city centre. The speed limit on the following roads is either 60 mph (100 km\/h) if there is a single-carriageway or country road, or 70 mph (110 km\/h) if a dual-carriageway.

In contrast, Aberdeen's city streets (which are maintained by the city council) have many potholes, dropped manhole covers and cracked\/damaged surfaces following the harsh winter of 2010\/11, many of which (as of 2013) have not yet been repaired due to budget constraints. Speed limits lower than 60 mph are often in force along main roads because Aberdeenshire has some of the most dangerous roads in Scotland. To improve safety at accident blackspots, speed limits  are enforced by many automated speed cameras as well as police patrol cars. The Dundee to Aberdeen section of the A90 has a particularly large number of these.\n\nAlthough all city streets are lit at night, most main roads leading into the city (including the A90 and A96) are not lit except at major intersections. Be prepared to use main beam (i.e. high beam) headlights. Added to this, roads in Aberdeenshire are among the most dangerous in the UK, due to frequent bends and chicanes, narrow carriageways, and excessive speed by many drivers. While this makes many of them great fun to drive if your car handles well, you should drive cautiously if you are not familiar with a rural road and especially if your car's steering wheel is on the left. Local drivers (usually in powerful German cars bought with oil money) often drive aggressively or overtake thoughtlessly, and this is partly responsible for the high accident rate. Do not be intimidated or goaded into going too fast and remain at a speed you are comfortable with as  otherwise your trip may end with being airlifted to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.\n\nIn winter, roads are often affected by snow and fog (with much heavier snow the further inland). Main roads (e.g. A90) are gritted but local roads are not, leading to very slippery conditions and increased risk of accidents. This is compounded by the fact that few Scottish cars are fitted with snow tyres or snow chains in winter (although these are available in Aberdeen). On mountain routes (e.g. A93), roads are often closed due to snow by \"snow gates\" which are shut by police and close off the road. However, all except coastal roads can be closed by heavy snow when weather is poor. Avoid car travel in poor winter weather unless you are experienced with driving in these conditions.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Mapframe"],["57.1500"],["-2.1000"],["zoom=14"],["height=550"],["width=550"],["layer=M"],["align=center"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Castlegate, Aberdeen - geograph.org.uk - 1548649.jpg"],["thumb"],["The Castlegate is the city's main public square.

FirstGroup is an Aberdeen company; it developed out of the Aberdeen city bus corporation after it was privatised in the 1980s, and grew massively following numerous mergers and takeovers (they run many UK bus and train services, including ScotRail, and own the Greyhound bus network in the United States). Some buses are also run by Stagecoach Bluebird ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.stagecoachbus.com\/localdefault.aspx?TAG=0"]},", who operate routes No.5, 59, and 9U, as well as the 727 airport bus. However, apart from these routes, most Stagecoach Bluebird buses are running between the bus station at Union Square and towns and villages in Aberdeenshire. While these regional buses do pick up and stop at city bus stops, they are a less useful option for within-city transport.\n\nToday there are around 22 city bus routes run by First Aberdeen and 3 by Stagecoach Bluebird and most operate on a hub-and-spoke system, i.e. a route starts in a suburb or on the outskirts, comes in through the city centre, and then goes out to another suburb. Services begin around 5AM and end close to midnight with a few night services at weekends. The First network uses a colour-coded system with main routes having a colour (e.g. 3 is purple, 20 is indigo, 1&2 are red) while less important routes have no colour. The map is in the style of the London Underground which helps to find your way around. Information on routes is available on First Aberdeen's website ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.firstgroup.com\/ukbus\/aberdeen\/"]},", but for face-to-face info, bus maps, timetables and bus passes, call into the ",{"type":"'''","value":["First Travel Centre on Union Street"]},", between Market Street and the Shiprow.

All buses are modern and have low-floor access. First Aberdeen has a virtual monopoly and has a reputation for mediocre service and high fares that are raised frequently with little notice or justification.

The dramatic architecture, although now mostly in need of restoration, is not visible in storefronts at street level - ",{"type":"'''","value":["look up"]}," to see the impressive carved granite and grand designs of each building. Sidewalks on the street get very busy during the day and especially on weekends.\n\nIn recent years more upmarket stores have been gravitating from Union Street and other streets to the shopping malls in the city centre, and independent stores to the streets around Union Street. At the same time, some shops on Union Street have been moving downmarket. As a result, shopping in Aberdeen is spread out around Union Street, these malls, and surrounding streets. The shopping malls are extremely popular with Aberdonians. They include the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bon Accord Centre"]}," (entrances on Upperkirkgate and George Street), the ",{"type":"'''","value":["St. Nicholas Centre"]}," (entrances on Upperkirkgate and St. Nicholas Square), the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Trinity Centre"]}," (entrances on Union Street and Guild Street), ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Academy"]}," (entrance on Schoolhill, specialises in boutique shops), and the newest and largest, ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.unionsquareaberdeen.com\/website\/home.aspx Union Square"]}]}," on Guild Street.

The current modern building provides an indoor market which offers permanent space to small stallholders providing retail, food or other services. Most of the units inside are small shop-like enclosures, and the low rents provide a chance for small start-ups and local entrepreneurs to get a foothold while building up their business, before moving to more established areas of the city-centre. Although it appears downmarket, footfall is quite high and you may encounter hidden gems!

Aberdeen beggars are not aggressive and while they will ask passers-by indiscriminately for spare change, they can just be ignored. Aberdeen is a harbour city and prostitution occurs in certain streets in the harbour area. Prostitutes are not always provocatively dressed and may approach male passers-by saying \"Are you looking for business?\". Do not engage a prostitute as this is illegal.\n\nThe main possibility of hassle is with ",{"type":"'''","value":["alcohol-related aggression"]}," at night (particularly weekend nights). While few Scots would admit it, most cannot handle anything like as much alcohol as they would claim and on nights out, many (both men and women) drink far more than they can handle. Public drunkenness on weekend nights is an issue, as throughout Scotland. As a result, brawls, assaults and abuse (e.g. racist or homophobic language) are not uncommon and there is a heavy police presence on weekend nights. To avoid any hassle, firstly avoid drinking more than you can handle yourself. Avoid getting into arguments, making eye contact with groups of males, or staring at obviously drunken individuals. If you are from England, avoid displays of English symbolism such as the St. George's Cross or wearing England sports kits as this may make you or your group a target for aggressive drunks looking for an excuse for a fight.
