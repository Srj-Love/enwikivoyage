Today, despite the current political issues in Cote d'Ivoire at large, Abidjan remains the economic and de facto capital of the country.  Even after everything that's happened, it still boasts a large selection of restaurants, hotels, sites, and other reasons to visit.

However, there are many options to get around via motor transport.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Taxis"]},"\n\nThey have a complex system that is comprised of two types of car taxis.  The first type that most visitors will encounter are the orange (or red-orange) ones.  These are legally able to operate anywhere in the city and you will most likely be able to ride solo in them.  They are also the most expensive.  A ride from the airport will run most people (especially non-Africans who speak little French) about 5,000 CFA, even to districts that are just 3 km away.  If willing to haggle a lot (the drivers will often complain that they have to pay a fee to pick up passengers there, which is a lie) you may be able to get it to 3,500 or 2,500 CFA.  A ride between two distant districts such as Zone Quatre and Plateau will be about 2,000 CFA.\n\nThe other type of taxi is color-coded to operate in a specific neighborhood, such as the green taxis you'll see in an area such as Koumassi.  These are significantly cheaper, but will most likely have to be shared and of course the distance they can travel is limited to a single neighborhood.\n\nTravel books often make allusion to some taxis having meters.  If they do (and this is rare), they are never working and you always, always agree on the price prior to departure.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Bus"]},"\n\nThere are several bus routes throughout the city.  They are cheap and decently reliable, although they are often incredibly crowded due to insufficient numbers.  Some of the bus stations can be overwhelming though, such as Adjame which, for those new to travel in West African cities will be a lot to handle. There is also the threat of pickpockets in these crowded areas.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Moto"]},"\n\nIn 2010, the Ivorian government relaxed import restrictions on small motorcycles.  Prior to this, the amount of motorcycles you would see on the street was negligible and there were absolutely none acting as taxis as it was illegal.

During the long and stable rule of the Ivory Coast's Godfather Felix Huphouet-Boigny the city of Abidjan has flourished. However, the political instability and the civil war of the past decade have taken their toll on the city. Neglect, low maintenance of buildings and public space and the mass exodus of foreigners have given the city an atmosphere of \"lost glory\". Nowhere is this to be seen better than in the famous Hotel Ivoire. Entering it is like taking a trip to the sixties; since its construction there have been no significant changes or modernisation to its interior and furniture. Too bad though that its massive swimming pool has weeds growing on the bottom instead of blue waters.\nVery nice is the public zoo.

The cassava (manioc) can be eaten cooked whole, as a mash called plakali, mixed with banana (foutou) or in crums (atchiki). Fish is usually the cheapest meal.

First and foremost are the military checkpoints.  While generally harmless for foreigners, they can make it maddening to get across the city in a timely fashion, especially if one is in a private care.  Bribes are commonplace, but not an absolute.  Carrying small bills is always a good idea.  Otherwise, just agreeing with the officer bothering you is the best course of action.  If you're respectful, they'll usually let you be, unless you are French, in which case you will be hassled a good deal more due to the Ivorians having heavy disdain for French involvement in their country.\n\nAlso if in a private car, you'll notice that most people roll through red lights late at night.  While illegal, there have been incidents of carjackings when people are stopped, so heed this warning as you see best.\n\nSomething else to keep in mind is that Cote d'Ivoire literally shuts down at midnight until 05:00.  As a remnant of a curfew imposed during the last civil war, they barricade all the main points of entry and exit to all the towns.  If you find yourself on the wrong side of that barricade when it is closed (such as staying in Bassam, but partying in Abidjan) you will absolutely not be let through until 05:00.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pickpockets"]]}," are a problem in crowded places much like anywhere else in the world.  Keep track of your personal items and make sure your bags are well closed when passing through busy bus stations or markets.\n\nWhile the most lively of neighborhoods, places such as Koumassi, Treichville, and Yopougon are probably best avoided unless going there with a local.  Yopougon is undoubtedly the safest with the most impressive assortment of street food, but there can also be young, drunken men in these areas who can be looking for trouble.  That said, if you're not starting the trouble and try to defuse the situation, you'll probably not have any issues as people in Abidjan are used to an international crowd in their city.\n\nWomen should not go out unaccompanied at night.  During the day, you'll have no problems.  Ivorian society is most definitely patriarchal, but at the same time, the men are respectful of international women and at times maybe a bit too respectful, giving you a lot more attention than you'd like.  If you receive unwanted advances, just do as the local girls do and firmly tell them you're not interested.  They'll eventually get the point or move on to other women to \"charm\".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Embassies"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["Canada"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Canada"],["url=http:\/\/www.canadainternational.gc.ca\/cotedivoire\/index.aspx?lang=eng"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["United States"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=United States"],["url=http:\/\/abidjan.usembassy.gov\/"],["email=consularabidja@state.gov"],["address=01 B.P. 1712 Abidjan 01 Côte d'Ivoire"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=(225) 22 49 40 00"],["tollfree="],["fax=(225) 22 49 43 23"],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Abengourou"]]}," - A small town three hours north where you can have an audience with the king of Indénié Kingdom."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bouaké"]]},"- The second largest city of Côte d'Ivoire located in the dead center of the country with a lively market and night scene."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Grand-Bassam"]]}," - About 45 minutes to the East and the original capital of the country with old Colonial architecture that is being restored and an excellent beach."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jacqueville"]]}," - A small, relaxing beach town that sits about an hour from Abidjan with a short, 450m ferry across the lagoon."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Pedro (Côte d'Ivoire)"],["San Pedro"]]}," - An old town about six hours West of Abidjan with nice beaches which serves as a secondary port city for the country."]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usablecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["5.3167"],["-4.0333"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Lagunes"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Abidjan"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Abidjan"]]}]
