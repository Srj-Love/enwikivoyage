In the late 1980s and early 1990s the Soviet Union was undermined by strong nationalist feelings among its various peoples. The Abkhaz people feared domination by the emerging independent Georgia and so sort their own independence. Violent clashes culminated in full-scale war in 1992: 3,000 Georgian troops overtook Abkhazia and dismantled the separatist government. In response various pro-Russian militias and regular Russian troops backed the secessionists. By 1993 they had driven the Georgians out and had massacred tens of thousands that remained.\n\nAfter the war all Abkhazia, except a few villages, was out of Georgian control. As a minor operation in the 2008 South Ossetian war Abkhaz forces overtook these few remaining villages.\n\nSince the 1990s Russia has supported the Abkhaz separatists and sought to isolate the region from Georgia; and it is to Russia that Abkhazia looks today.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Abkhaz phrasebook"],["Abkhaz"]]},", in the Northwest Caucasian linguistic family, is related to the Abkhaz-Adyghe language group in the same family.

For the common traveller the country is relatively safe, but you should make sure to avoid any place near the border to Georgia. Some minor unregistered minefields are reported near the border, an additional reason to steer well clear of it. Keep in mind that Abkhazia is, in the view of international law, still a part of Georgia. Further military confrontations are unlikely but you should closely follow the international and independent news in case the situation changes. Travellers who have visited Abkhazia and intend to visit Georgia can be questioned, refused entry to Georgia or in the worst case be imprisoned by Georgian immigration officers, as entry to Abkhazia is seen as illegal immigration.\n\nWhile many travellers cross the border with Georgia proper back and forth with no problems, keep in mind that the southeastern areas of Abkhazia on the way, around Gali and Ochamchira more specifically, are the most impoverished parts of a country already not doing so well, so the time spent there should be kept no longer than is necessary. The Abkhaz side of the actual border zone at Enguri\/Ingur seems safe as long as the militia is there—but note that they leave the place as soon as the crossing gets shut by 19:00, and there is at least one report of a traveller being a victim of a violent mugging which took place there after the militia left.\n\nIf you are not from the few countries that recognize Abkhazia, being in a conflict zone means that you are left stranded with absolutely no consular support should you lose your passport for some reason. In such a case, a traveller reportedly could make it back to Georgia only after the involvement of the Red Cross delegation (48 Inal-Ipa  St, Sukhumi) and some high-ranking Abkhaz officials, which may not be available next time.\n\nThe basic precautions for travellers are those recommended in all tourist destinations:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Watch your bag or purse in public e.g. buses, trains and meetings.
