Vegetable and bean-heavy native dishes, the array of splendid pure vegetarian Indian cuisine, and the ready availability of fresh salads make eating in Abu Dhabi a stress-free experience. Strict vegans may have a little difficulty communicating their precise demands, but most places offer vegan dishes and are always willing to accommodate a paying customer. The best choice for pure Vegans would be one of the many Indian veg restaurants like Evergreen, Sangeetha in Tourist Club area.\n\nVisitors should always check the Islamic calendar to determine whether they will be visiting during the month of Ramadan.  Since Muslims fast during daylight hours, restaurants are, by law, closed during the day.  It is also against the law to eat or drink anything, even water, in public and tourists (and non-Muslim residents) have been arrested and given fines.  Large hotels generally have one restaurant open during the day to serve meals to non-Muslims.  During the evening, however, it's quite a different story, as the festive atmosphere of ",{"type":"''","value":["iftar"]}," (breaking the fast) begins and residents gather for lavish, Thanksgiving-like meals.
