It occupies an area of 26,000 square miles. Its long coastline—the shallow waters of the Southern Gulf, extending from the base of the Qatar Peninsula in the west to the border of the emirate of Dubai on the north east—was once the world's best waters for pearling. When the pearling industry declined, oil discovery in the offshore oilfields of the Southern Gulf revived the economy of Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi was also the first emirate to export oil from the Umm Shaif offshore field in 1962. On the land, it stretches south to the oases of Liwa where some of the world's largest sand dunes can be found and east to the ancient oasis of Al Ain. This makes Abu Dhabi the largest as well as the most populated of all the emirates.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nBoth ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Abu Dhabi"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Al Ain"]]}," have international airports, although Abu Dhabi's is by far the larger and better-connected of the two.

The trips vary slightly but normally you arrive back to your hotel in the evening around 10pm. Most packages include an exhilarating drive over the dunes by an experienced driver in a 4x4 vehicle, a short camel ride, delicious Arabic buffet and Belly Dancer. Note that the belly dancer is normally included only if there are enough of you in your party so enquire at the time of booking."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nNon-Muslims are permitted to bring up to 4L of alcohol into Abu Dhabi.
