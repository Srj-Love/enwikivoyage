It is a very small settlement with very little to attract visitors other than its great temples for which it is famous. Few tourists linger for more than a few hours, although there are 5 hotels to attract visitors to stay the night.\n\nThe temples at Abu Simbel were formerly located further down the hillside, facing the Nile in the same relative positions, but due to the rising waters of Lake Nasser, the original locations are underwater.  In the 1960s, each temple was carefully sawed into numbered stone cubes, moved uphill, and reassembled before the water rose.\n\nThe Great Temple of Ramses II was reassembled fronting a fake mountain, built like a domed basketball court, where the stone cubes occupy a section under the dome; from outside, the fake mountain looks like solid rock.\n\nArchaeologists have concluded that the immense sizes of the statues in the Great Temple were intended to scare potential enemies approaching Egypt's southern region, as they travelled down the Nile from out of Africa.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh = 23.6"],["febhigh = 26"],["marhigh = 30.2"],["aprhigh = 35.3"],["mayhigh = 39.1"],["junhigh = 40.6"],["julhigh = 40.2"],["aughigh = 40.2"],["sephigh = 38.7"],["octhigh = 36"],["novhigh = 29.7"],["dechigh = 24.9"],["janlow = 9.2"],["feblow = 10.4"],["marlow = 14.1"],["aprlow = 18.8"],["maylow = 23"],["junlow = 24.8"],["jullow = 25.3"],["auglow = 25.7"],["seplow = 24.2"],["octlow = 21.6"],["novlow = 15.8"],["declow = 11.4"],["janprecip = 0"],["febprecip = 0"],["marprecip = 0"],["aprprecip = 0"],["mayprecip = 0"],["junprecip = 0"],["julprecip = 0"],["augprecip = 0"],["sepprecip = 0"],["octprecip = 0"],["novprecip = 0"],["decprecip = 0"],["description = Source: ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/en.climate-data.org\/location\/475742\/ Climate-Data.org"]}]]},"\n\n: ",{"type":"''","value":["See also: ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Egypt#Climate"]]}]},"\n\nSummers are extremely hot at days, while winters are warm at days and mild at nights.

Its axis was positioned by the ancient Egyptian architects in such a way that twice a year, on February and October 20, the rays of the sun would penetrate the sanctuary and illuminate the sculpture on the back wall, except for the statue of Ptah, the god connected with the Underworld, who always remained in the dark. These dates are allegedly the king's birthday and coronation day respectively, but there is no evidence to support this, though it is quite logical to assume that these dates had some relation to a great event, such as the jubilee celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the pharaoh's rule. This image of the king was enhanced and revitalized by the energy of the solar star, and the deified Ramesses II could take his place next to Amun Ra and Ra-Horakhty. Due to the displacement of the temple, it is widely believed that this event now occurs one day later than it did originally. Also, look for a \"Kilroy was here\" on the lower legs of one of the 4 giant statues of Ramesses II, along with other graffiti, formerly considered fashionable.\n\nBe sure to follow the pathway inside the fake mountain dome, to see how the mountain was constructed.\n\nIf you are a student make sure to bring your student ID with a photo of yourself on it.
