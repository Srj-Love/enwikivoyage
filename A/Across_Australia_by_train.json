The sand and heat made the trip entirely unsuited to horses. The cameleers overwhelmingly weren't from Afghanistan, they were just known as Afghans in the Australian vernacular.\n\nThe construction of the original Ghan from Adelaide started in 1878, with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oodnadatta"]]}," reached in 1891 and, after a thirty-year break, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alice Springs"]]}," in 1926.  A separate but unconnected track from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Darwin"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Katherine"]]}," in the north was also completed in the same year.\n\nUnfortunately, the original Ghan was twisty, narrow-gauge and built straight through many valleys prone to flash floods that washed away tracks and bridges. A decision was thus made to rebuild nearly all of the line in standard gauge, over 100 km to the west. The new line to Alice Springs opened in 1980, and the remaining 1420 km section across the continent to Darwin opened in 2004.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History of the ",{"type":"''","value":["Indian Pacific"]}]},"\nA single train journey from Sydney to Perth (linking the Indian and Pacific Oceans) became possible with the completion of the standard gauge railway in 1969 when the last standard gauge link was completed between Broken Hill and Peterborough. Prior to this, travelling across Australia by train between Perth and Sydney was a relay of trains.  At certain times in history there were four changes of railway gauge at Broken Hill, Peterborough, Port Pirie, and Kalgoorlie.  The great mining town of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Broken Hill"]]}," was linked by the narrow gauge railways to Port Pirie (north of Adelaide) before it was linked with Sydney.  You can see some of this history in the Sulphide Street Railway museum in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Broken Hill"]]},", at Steamtown in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Peterborough (South Australia)"],["Peterborough"]]},", and at the museum in the old station at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Port Pirie"]]},".  The railway line in Port Pirie ran right down the main street of the town.  In the 1930s, the transcontinental trip was over 5 days, with changes of trains through Albury, Melbourne, Adelaide, Port Pirie and Kalgoorlie.\n\nThe breaks of gauge were due to the states each having their own gauge, and the Commonwealth completing the missing link between Port Pirie and Kalgoorlie in standard gauge (the same as New South Wales).\n\nSome towns along the line enjoyed several services a day during their heyday.  The full Sydney to Perth service ran three times a week.  Today, however, the irony is that railway buffs can see more of the rail history of the line and the towns along it travelling by car than by train.  You can spend a good half day exploring the history of Peterborough and of Port Pirie, but the train may not be along to pick you up for another week.  The motorail gives you the option of driving one way, and catching the train back.\n\nIt is only in the past forty years you have been able to catch one train from Sydney to Perth.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Prepare"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:The Ghan route map.png"],["thumb"],["upright=1.7"],[{"type":"''","value":["The Ghan"]}]]},"\nAny way you look at it, ",{"type":"''","value":["The Ghan"]}," and the ",{"type":"''","value":["Indian Pacific"]}," are ",{"type":"'''","value":["expensive"]},", unless you purchase a ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.greatsouthernrail.com.au\/site\/travelinfo\/rail_passes.jsp Rail Pass"]}]},".

On the premium fare there are often deals available to take a car for $99 extra, which you can the offset against the price of renting a car at your destination, or if you drive one way, the prospect of the 3000 km drive home.\n\nYou can also leverage some value out of taken stops at the destinations along the way, with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alice Springs"]]}," being the perfect stopping point on the Ghan, and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Broken Hill"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Adelaide"]]}," both being good options on the ",{"type":"''","value":["Indian Pacific"]},".
