It's for hikers or cyclists, and brings you past oak wood sculptures made by the artist Ad Wouters, 2 of the oldest trees in the forest and several other attractions which are worth a visit.\n\nAd's Path as it's described here, was based on the description you can find on ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.adwouters.be\/padvanad\/ his web site"]}," in Dutch. The description in the present article deviates from the original though. It's also written in such a way that one can either follow the whole route in one go, or one can divide it up into shorter stretches and go and come back or jump in by using public transportation. For very adventurous people there is even the possibility to camp half way through. The camping site is very primitive though and doing that would involve a lot more preparation and dragging camping gear along.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Theme"]},"\nThe theme of the route revolves around the artwork of Ad Wouters, who is an artist with a social and an ecological engagement. He worked in construction, starting when he was 13. This experience gave him a lot of knowledge of materials like plaster and wood. Later on, he worked in the restoration of historic buildings. Unfortunately he fell from a church tower in a work-related accident, which left him unable to work full days. He used this misfortune as an opportunity and developed himself as a creative artist, with a preference to use recycled materials.\n\nOn this walk you'll encounter several wooden sculptures and one work made of metal wire filled with litter, as a statement about how we manage waste products. In Leuven there are more wooden sculptures, but also a statue of Saint Michael, which seems to be made of metal, but it's actually coated polyester, the material also used to make kayaks, which was then coated with bronze to reduce cost.\nHis motivation for creating and setting up these works in public spaces is for people to enjoy them.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Network of numbered walking nodes"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Wandelknooppunt Zuid-Dijleland 115.jpg"],["70px"],["right"],["thumb"],["Wandelknooppuntpaaltje Zuid-Dijleland Knooppunt 115"]]},"\nTourism services of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Flemish Brabant"]]}," created a network of numbered walking nodes all across Zuid-Dijleland (Southern Dyle River Area), which were used to give pointers about this route.
