It is comprised principally of the \"towns\" of Ada Foah, Big Ada, and Ada Kasseh. Ada Foah, which is also the district capital, is located at the beach and river estuary, and naturally is where most visitors spend their time. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThe district's coconut palm fringed coastline is 45 kilometers long and provides a living to many people that are employed in fishing and fish processing. However, this coastline is constantly being eroded by the strong tidal waves that are washing away or threatening several villages that are located close to the beach. In order to solve this problem, the construction of a sea defense wall is under way since 2010.\n\nThe long, sandy beaches are certainly some of the most important tourist attractions. However, there are certain obstacles such as the lack of toilets in the villages close to the beach and the consequence of using the beach as such. Also, garbage – mostly plastic – is piling up at the beach, some of it disposed there, some washed up from the sea by the tide.\n\nApart from the sandy beaches, another natural attraction in the district is the Volta River and its estuary. The Volta River forms the eastern boundary of the district before it reaches the Gulf of Guinea. The islands in the river and in the estuary are a wildlife paradise: marine turtles, birds, crocodiles and monkeys are some of the animals living there. The mangrove vegetation in the salty parts of the estuary is another attraction and an important ecosystem. It is however endangered by human activity along with rare animals that are often hunted down.\n\nThe estuary also offers the best conditions for water sports like sailing, canoeing, fishing, water skiing, wake boarding and jet skiing.\n\nAnother important water body and one of the most important salt mining areas in the country is the Songor Lagoon. Additional to visiting it and learning about salt mining it serves as a base for birdwatchers.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nMost of the inhabitants (85.9 %) belong to the Dangme Tribe. The local language in the Dangme East and West District is Dangme, also called Adangme. It is a Kwa language and is spoken by around 800.000 people in the Dangme East, Dangme West, Volta Region and Togo. They are part of the Ga-Dangbe ancestral lineage. The Dangme speak und understand Ga Language as it is similar to Dangme. English is also spoken by nearly everyone since it is the official language of the country. Many people also speak some Ewe (to communicate with the neighboring people of the Volta Region, Togo and Benin) or Twi.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Ada Estuary Beach Camp oceanside.JPG"],["thumb"],["270px"],["The oceanside beach"]]},"\n\nThe best way to get to Ada is by Tro-Tro (small bus), taxi, your own or a rental car. \n\nFrom ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Accra"]]},": there is a reagular connection (1 1\/2 to 2 1\/2 hours, about 120 km) from Tudu Station or from Tema Roundabout. Some Tro-Tros go directly to Ada Foah, with others you have to change in Ada Kasseh. The usual times of operation are between 4.30 am and 9.30 pm, but can vary according to the day of the week. \n\nFrom ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Aflao"]]},":take a Tro-Tro in the direction to Accra and get off at Ada Kasseh (3-4 hours, about 80 km).\n\nYou can also get there by ferry from the Volta Region (Anyanui). It only operates on Wednesdays and leaves Anyanui at around 1pm and 6pm and takes about 1 1\/2 hours. It departs in Ada Foah around 8am and 3pm. \n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nTaxis are readily available, either by car or by motorcycle. Even though motorcycles are not officially allowed to operate as taxis, it is a very common and affordable means of transport. And it can bring you to faraway places that don't seem to be accessible with any vehicle. Just stand at the street and stop a passing one. You can also ask your guesthouse or the Tourist Information Center to book one for you.\n\nThe best way to get around is the ever present Tro-Tro (small bus). It's easy to get around with a reagular connection between Ada Foah and Kasseh (about 20 km). \n\nIf you feel like taking the water route, consider joining the ferry to the market in Anyanui on Wednesdays. This is a very fun way of getting to the other side of the Volta River with a big crowd of locals who bring their products to the market. The ferry leaves Ada Foah around 8 am and 3 pm and returns from Anyanui around 1 pm and 6 pm. It takes about 1 1\/2 hours one way. These are only approximate times - in general, the ferry operates similar to the Tro-Tro: it leaves when it's full.\n\nThe Estuary Beach camps are a little harder to reach. The typical way is to grab a motor canoe from virtually any beach on the bayside, with the closest, cheapest option being from the end of the taxi-passable road at the entrance to Azazanyi Village. You can do the sandy 30-minute walk through Azazanyi too, with the most direct (and lightest hassle) route being along the oceanside beach.\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Community zoo"]},". Samuel Kabutey Kabo caught his first snake when he built a well some years ago. He went to town to get some supplies and accidently ran over a cobra with his bike. The snake got very angry and followed him back to his house where it fell into the half-finished well. Samuel's first instinct was to kill the snake, but the Wildlife Division told him that he should keep it and show it to the people to educate them about local animals. That is how the community zoo started. After the Cobra Samuel also caught some pythons and crocodiles that can all be visited at the zoo. "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Crocodile Island"]},". There used to be a great number of crocodiles living on one of the islands in the river. But increased human activities drove them away. All that is left nowadays are two or three crocodiles living in a small walled cage on Pediatorkope island. There is no tour to visit them, but any boat operator will take you there if you want or just rent a canoe and paddle there yourself."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Fetish shrines"]},". Shrines are part of daily life in Ghana. The two major shrines in Big Ada were closely connected to Trokosi, or girl child slavery. In this traditional perception, a crime is atoned for when a girl of the offender's family is send to a shrine to serve the gods. This can be for months, but also for many years. Although this practice was legally abolished in 1998, there are still some groups who want to hold on to this tradition. Other opposing groups on the other hand have put much effort into the liberation of the girls and their education and reintegration into society. "]},"In Big Ada, Dasume Shrine and Dada Shrine (also called Ogbekpe) can be visited. There is another big one in Goi, one on the island of Alorkpem and one on the other side of the Volta in Anyanui. \n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Fetish priests"]},". Every shrine has its priest who takes care of it and worships the gods in it. So naturally, there is a great number of shrines in the district – most of which can also be visited. Many priests have special healing abilities, do spiritual ceremonies and are consulted for any kind of problem from sicknesses to family problems, unemployment or bad luck. "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Fishing"]},". Building traditional fishing boats requires much work and is very expensive. The lower part of the boat is made of one big piece of wood, the upper part of planks. All the boats are then painted in many colors with religious sayings written on it. There are many fishing villages around, the bigger ones being Akplabana and Pute. "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Monkey Island"]},". You have to get up early to see the monkeys on so called \"Monkey Island\" in the Volta River.

Only few people know where Ada Foah has got its name from. The reason is the fort near the Presbyterian Church that gave the town its name to distinguish the two Adas: Ada Fort, village of the fort. As the sea comes closer more than 1.5 meters each year, it is gradually washing the building that once used to be a prison into the ocean. Half of it is already eroded but hopefully the upcoming construction of the sea defense wall will stop this progress. "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Ostrich Farm"]},". If you want to see some really big birds go to Dedukope Ostrich Farm, located close to the border of the Dangme East District. They have some hundred ostriches living in enclosures whose meat is sold to restaurants. You can walk along the enclosures and have a look at the giant eggs. It's a bit difficult to get there, there is no established tour so far and the only information you get is from the watchman or the taxi driver (a small tip is appreciated for the visit). "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Presbyterian church and missionary cemetery"]},". When looking at the Presbyterian Church in Ada Foah you will be aware that it is a missionary church built by the first generation of Ghanaian Christians at around 1890. When the European missionaries came to Ghana in the 19th century they faced harsh conditions that they were not adapted to. Many died very young of various tropical diseases. These missionaries were buried at the cemetery next to the Presbyterian Church in Ada Foah. "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Sacred Woods"]},".

Visit the Songor Lagoon, the biggest natural salt mining area in Ghana; only about 15 minutes drive from Ada. At this communal salt field you can watch locals at all stages of salt production: from inducing salt water from the ocean into the pans, the crystallization when it dries to washing and packing the salt into bags and loading them unto trucks. Apart from watching the salt mining activities, it is also an excellent place for watching the wintering European birds. The Wildlife Division has put up some observation towers and offers guided tours to the sight.

Although the majority of the Ghanaians are buried in normal ones, there are some carpenters that have specialized in building eccentric coffins. All are made for order and can be any shape you can imagine, from fish, canoes and Tro-Tros to sewing machines, pepperoni, tomatoes and books. The shape of the coffin is always connected to the life or profession of the deceased, so a fisherman would be buried in a fish or canoe, a teacher in a book and a farmer in a tomato."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Markets"]}]},"There is a big market in Kasseh on Tuesdays and Fridays where you can get just about anything you can imagine.
