It's not much known as a tourism destination, though, especially when compared with its southern and western neighbours. However, that being said there are a number of sites of interest in the surrounding countryside.\n\nModern Adana consists of two quite separate sections: cramped old city centre and newer, mostly high-rise suburbs overlooking the Seyhan dam to north of the old centre, usually called ",{"type":"''","value":["Kuzey Adana"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["Yeni Adana"]}," (i.e. \"North Adana\" or \"New Adana\", respectively).\n\nDespite its location Adana is a remarkably modern and Western city.  This is in large part due to the presence of a NATO base in Incirlik, which provides the city with an unusually large population of Westerners, and foreign-educated Turks.  Adana is also a destination for dental tourism, owing to a large number of cheap, effective, English-speaking dentists in the area.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By air "]},"\nFlights arrive at the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Adana Sakirpasa Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["ADA"]]},") ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.adanahavaalani.com"]}," located in the city outskirts.

Make sure you get off at the right station as most buses also stop at a station in the suburbs, about 4 km west of city centre.

However trains are cheaper, and arguably much more comfortable than buses, as Pullman cars have larger seats and tend to be relatively empty, allowing travelers to have two seats to themselves, as bathrooms are available, and as on overnight trains sleeping cars are an option, and trains usually have a dining car.  \n\nThere are currently two overnight trains: the ",{"type":"''","value":["İçanadolu Mavi Tren"]}," departs Haydarpaşa station in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Istanbul"]]}," nightly at 11:50PM, arriving in Adana the next evening around 6:40PM, and stops in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Eskişehir"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Konya"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Karaman"]]},".
