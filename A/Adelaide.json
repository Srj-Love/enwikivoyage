It lies on the eastern shores of Gulf St Vincent in the central, southern part of the Australian continent. Adelaide is Australia's fifth largest city, with a population of over 1.2 million. More than three quarters of South Australians live in the Adelaide metropolitan area.\n\nAdelaide is located on a plain between the rolling ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Adelaide Hills"]]}," and the Gulf and is bordered by many of Australia's famous wine regions. The ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Barossa Valley"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Clare Valley"]]}," regions lie to the north, the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["McLaren Vale"]]}," and Langhorne Creek regions to the south and the cooler climate ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Adelaide Hills"]]}," region to the east. Historically known as the City of Churches due to its new world origins as an incubator for religious freedom, much of the architecture in the inner city is retained from the colonial era. Heavily influenced by the prevailing styles popular in England at the time, the heritage architecture is similar to many European cities built in the 19th century.\n\nProximity to premium wine and food growing regions, as well as waves of immigration from Italy, Greece, Vietnam, China and India have created a unique multicultural gourmet food and café culture in the City and inner suburbs. This café culture is supported by Adelaide's global reputation for the arts and particularly the arts festivals held in March including the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.adelaidefestival.com.au Adelaide Festival"]}," and the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.adelaidefringe.com.au Adelaide Fringe Festival"]},", which is second only to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in size.\n\nThe city is the home of Adelaide Oval, famed as one of Test cricket's most picturesque grounds and currently ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.adelaideoval.com.au under redevelopment"]}," to host AFL football matches during the winter months.

The Kaurna lived on the Adelaide plains in family groups called ",{"type":"''","value":["yerta"]},", a word which also referred to the area of land which supported the family group. Each yerta was the responsibility of Kaurna adults who inherited the land and had an intimate knowledge of its resources and features. Adelaide's rich Aboriginal history and living culture can be explored at ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.tandanya.com.au Tandanya"]},", an Aboriginal-owned culture and history centre on Grenfell Street. Tandanya is free to visit and tours are available for a small charge.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["European settlement"]},"\nFollowing the mapping of South Australia's coastline in the early 19th century by European explorers Matthew Flinders and Nicolas Baudin, an expedition down the Murray River was held which reported favourably on land on the coast of Gulf St Vincent. At the same time, British reformers were keen to establish a colony based on ",{"type":"'''","value":["free settlement"]}," rather than by the transportation of convicts, as all the other Australian colonies at the time were founded. In 1834, the South Australia Company was founded and it convinced the British Parliament to pass a law which created a colony for free settlers in South Australia. In December 1836, after a 10 month journey by a fleet of ships from England, the first Governor, John Hindmarsh proclaimed the creation of the new province in a ceremony in what is now the beachside suburb of Glenelg.\n\nAfter wrangling between the colonists, Adelaide's first surveyor, William Light designed a city grid of wide boulevards surrounded by parklands, with one central square (Victoria Square) and four smaller squares (Hindmarsh, Light, Whitmore and Hurtle) set on the southern banks of the Torrens. Light's original design, with small changes, largely survives to this day.\n\nThe city's early industries were based around mining and agriculture, with England as the key export market. The relatively radical politics of many of the free settlers led to Adelaide being home to early progressive reform including the secret printed ballot, the first jurisdiction in the world to allow women to vote and run for Parliament and early trade unionisation and activism.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Post-Federation"]},"\nFollowing Australian federation in 1901, South Australia began to move into secondary manufacturing industries, a process which was sent into overdrive by the long term government of the conservative Premier Thomas Playford following World War 2. Playford set out to actively attract manufacturing companies like General Motors to South Australia by offering cheap land and low taxes. This, along with the growing ubiquity of car transport, led to Adelaide's relatively low density as workers lived close to the factories where they worked in the outer suburbs.\n\nMass migration from southern Europe transformed Adelaide's Anglo-Celtic culture, with Greek migrants mainly settling in the inner western and inner southern suburbs and Italian migrants settling in the inner eastern and north-eastern suburbs. These cultural identities persist to today, with continental delis and cafés being a common feature of Adelaide's inner city.\n\nWhile South Australia's economy boomed, its public and cultural life lost much of its early radicalism, with blue laws requiring bars and pubs to close at six in the evening - causing the \"six o'clock swill\". The White Australia policy also meant that Adelaide residents were overwhelmingly from European backgrounds.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Cosmopolitan capital city"]},"\nThe 1960s saw a dramatic change in Adelaide's cultural life, with the start of the Adelaide Festival of Arts and Adelaide Fringe Festival, which transformed Adelaide's arts culture and the end of the decade saw the election of the first Labor government since the 1930s. By 1970, Don Dunstan became Premier of South Australia. Dunstan was a transformational figure and sought to reshape Adelaide in the mould of a modern cosmopolitan capital city. Dunstan's government ended the six o'clock swill, pedestrianised Rundle Street creating Rundle Mall and built the Festival Centre, creating a hub for arts in Adelaide. His government enacted a range of progressive reforms, including making South Australia the first jurisdiction in Australia to end the death penalty and legalise homosexuality. This time also saw changes to Australia's immigration laws which saw Vietnamese and Chinese migrants join earlier waves of migration and the creation of communities in the north-west and western suburbs, as well as Gouger Street's multilingual Chinatown precinct next to the Adelaide Central Market.\n\nAfter losing government for one term to the conservatives at the end of the 1970s, Labor returned to office under John Bannon in the 1980s. A more business friendly leader than Dunstan, Premier Bannon sought to drive the development of Adelaide's city, seeing the construction of Adelaide's tallest building now known as Westpac House  and the development of the Adelaide Convention Centre and Adelaide Casino. However, bad bank loans saw the state-backed State Bank of South Australia collapse in the early 1990s, requiring a huge government bailout and plunging the state deep into debt.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Revival after the State Bank"]},"\nThe 1990s under the Liberal government led by Premiers Dean Brown, John Olsen and Rob Kerin saw the conservative government undertake asset sales and reduce government services to reduce the state debt. This reduction in government spending, as well as the decline of Australian manufacturing following the abolition of the tariff wall by the federal government, led to slow growth in South Australia's economy and widespread emigration to the eastern capitals, particularly Melbourne.\n\nLabor returned to office in 2002 under Mike Rann who sought to reshape Adelaide's industrial base to focus on education services, mining and defence industry, as well as building on its strengths in wine. Rann's government invested heavily in rebuilding the city, with overhauls to public transport, the construction of a new central hospital and the redevelopment of Adelaide Oval. Following ten years with Premier Rann as leader, Labor elected Jay Weatherill as Premier in 2011, who has largely continued this agenda, but with a renewed focus on transforming public spaces in the inner city through the relaxation of planning restrictions and looser liquor licensing for small bars.\n\nThe Government's conservative critics say that the Labor Government has spent too much money on rebuilding the city and that it faces a mounting debt bill.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Mapframe"],["-34.9267"],["138.5991"],["zoom=12"],["layer=M"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Adelaide International Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["ADL"]]},") is around 7km (4 mi) to the west of the city centre and is close to popular tourist beaches at Glenelg and Henley Beach.\n\nAdelaide International Airport has daily international flights to hubs in Asia, the Middle East and New Zealand which allow for one-stop connections across the globe.\n\nTravellers from ",{"type":"'''","value":["Asia"]}," can catch direct flights from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong"]]}," (on ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cathaypacific.com Cathay Pacific"]},"), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Singapore"]]}," (on ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.singaporeair.com Singapore Airlines"]},"), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kuala Lumpur"]]}," (on ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.malaysiaairlines.com Malaysia Airlines"]}," and ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.airasia.com\/au\/ Air Asia X"]},") and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Denpasar"]]}," (on ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.virginaustralia.com\/ Virgin Australia"]},").

Originally resulting from a loophole in liquor licensing laws, BYO is now a great opportunity to enjoy some of the wine which you have bought in a wine region, or to visit a local 'bottle shop' and enjoy a wider selection at lower prices.\n\nNowhere in Australia is BYO more common than in Adelaide. Most restaurants in Adelaide which serve alcohol will also allow BYO, though it's a good idea to call ahead to make sure. It's common for a charge called 'corkage' to be applied to the bill. Corkage will typically be around $5–$10 per bottle, though higher charges are not unheard of.
