Adrar is the Tamasheq word for mountain while Ifoghas is the name of a Tuareg clan which lives in the region, the French so named it to differentiate from their (long-held) Adrar in Mauritania. The area is home to a surprising number of animals, including gazelles, antelopes, hyenas, jackals, snakes, & lizards. It contains some very scenic desert landscapes, including granite outcrops, eroded sandstone, gueltas (similar to an oasis, but less \"green\" around them), rock paintings, petrified wood, and even an ancient river valley. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Settlements"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Abeibara"]]}," —"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Aguelhok"]]}," —"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Essouk"]]}," — called by some the \"cradle of the Tuareg\" this tiny town was once a prospering town along trans-Saharan trade routes from the 9th to 12th cneturies; rock painting dating to 8000 BC can be found, although little remains of its ancient past.

Independent travel is highly discouraged and a guide and 4x4 is absolutely essential. \n\nWhen camping (and sleeping) be sure your tent is entirely sealed as most animals, including venomous snakes and scorpions along with hyenas & jackals, are nocturnal. Be very careful when climbing around rocks and any place that is shady and cool, as these are the places snakes, scorpions, and other animals stay cool during the day. The sand viper buries itself entirely so that only the eyes appear above the sand, while there is a species of scorpion whose venom is more deadly than a cobra!
