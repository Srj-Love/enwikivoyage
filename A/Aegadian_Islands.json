Ustica ferries also run from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Marsala"]]}," to Favignana and Marettimo. The first ferries leave for Favignana between 7:00 and 7:30 am. The last ferry departs Favignana for Trapani at 20:00. The last ferry to Marsala leaves at 17:00. Tickets can be purchased from kiosks at the port. Arrive early for the evening return ferries, particularly on the weekends, as they sell out at times. Fares are between €5 and €9 each way.\n\nSeveral operators run all-day excursions to the islands from Trapani. Typically they visit two islands, giving you time to spend on the islands, and stops in bays where you can swim off the boat, with lunch provided on board. Prices are around €39 for excursions to Favignana and Levanzo, and €45 to Favignana and Marettimo. The boats leave from the part of Trapani port between Via XXX Gennaio and Via Rallo and you can buy tickets there or at other outlets around the old town. To be sure of getting a ticket at busy times, you might want to book the day before.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nLevanzo and Marettimo are small enough to walk around.
