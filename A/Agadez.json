Police have the authority to detain persons for more than 48 hours without cause.

Founded in the 11th century, Agadez was an important stop for caravans crossing the Saharan Desert for centuries. Agadez was held by the Mali empire during part of the 14th century, captured by the Songhai empire in 1515, and controlled by Bornu in the 17th century. It remained a trade center until the late 19th century. During much of this time it was a center of Islamic learning and the seat of several sultanates before its capture by the French in 1900. \n\nIt is a center of Tuareg culture and likewise two Tuareg rebellions in recent years: 1990-1995 & 2007-present. The Tuareg people are the original Canaanites from the Bible. The meaning of Canaan is 'land of the purple people.' This unusual moniker is in reference to the bluish-purple vegetable dye the Tuareg use to color their clothing that subsequently rubs off onto their skin. The Tuareg are renowned for their metal and leather workings.The region around Agadez is known for its spectacular desert\/mountain scenery.

Those of the Muslim faith believe that the arms of the cross will disperse all evil from the individual, thus keeping him out of harms way. Tuareg parents are known to give these exquisite silver crosses to their children when they are about to depart from home but they are worn by all as a form of good luck and protection. The silver crosses are uniquely shaped and are named after the town of Agadez from where they originate. The cross bears the jewelers mark on its back. The beaded necklace contains four cylindrical decoratively embossed silver segments.\n\nThe Touareg crosses sold come in a number of designs.  The Agadez cross is the most common, but many others are available.  Each design is associated with a particular Touareg market town.  Other examples include the Timia cross, the Iferouane cross and the unusual Ingal cross\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Le Piliers"]},"(+227) 94254419 - Italian restaurant run by the owner of the restaurants by the same name in Niamey and Iferoune."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Etoile du Tenere"]},",  (+227) 20 440 458."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["La Tendé"]},", (+227) 20 440 075, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/tende.free.fr in French"]},"."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Pension Tellit"]},", (+227) 20 440 231."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Hotel de la Paix"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat=16.971251"],["long=7.996472"],["directions="],["phone=(+227) 20 440 234"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nThere is not much around Agadez to visit. \n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Aïr mountains"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Tuareg festival"]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Iferouane"]]}]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Northern Niger"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Geo"],["16.966667"],["7.983333"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Agadez"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]}]
