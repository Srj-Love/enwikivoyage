The dogs are often feral (and hence not used to taking commands from people) and may be running wild in packs, which can be extremely intimidating if you are confronted by one. The obvious precautions — travel in groups, avoid areas where the dogs are, don't go out at night when they are most active, and carry a walking stick if you must go — will reduce the risks but not eliminate them.\n\nSuch dogs are rarely rabid, but it is possible. Consider being vaccinated against rabies before travelling to such areas. See individual articles here for region-specific information and consult a physician (preferably one with expertise in travel medicine) for advice on vaccinations before you travel. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" What to do when confronted by an aggressive dog "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["DO NOT RUN!"]}," Although it may seem counter-intuitive when you suddenly see an angry, barking and snarling dog running towards you, the most important thing to do is not to turn and run.
