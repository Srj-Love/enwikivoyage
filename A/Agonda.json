Though the waters here might not be the most ideal place for swimming (you have better beaches with calm waters in Goa), Agonda is definitely a place for those who want to quit on a Monday morning. Most mobile connections do not work here (only Vodafone does), so that is an added bonus for those looking forward to a quiet and relaxed holiday. Or, if you do need to party sometimes, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Palolem"]]}," is just 15 minutes by motorbike (10 km) away - but Agonda is generally cheaper, quieter, hassle-free and has much less \"touristic\" feel.\n\nAgonda Beach basically has one long road parallel to the beach line, most rooms and bungalows for rent are located either between them or on the opposite side of the road. In the centre of the beach, there is Agonda Church and a local school\/college (funnily enough, called Agonda University) to the right of it. Another road goes up from the church, crosses the river shortly after and goes through the village to the junction with a main road from Chaudi and Palolem, which are both to the right. To the left, this bigger road crosses the village until the beach road joins it near the river mouth and northern end of the beach, then continues on in the direction of Cabo da Rama.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nDabolim airport is about a 90-minute drive away. Agonda by road is 15 minutes from the more famous, busy ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Palolem"]]}," beach. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nAgonda is only a few kilometres from Canacona station, although main train services stop at Margao station, about an hour’s drive away.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nRegular buses depart from the Canacona bus station for Agonda (about 20 minutes). Buses from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chaudi"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Margao"]]}," are available a few times a day. \nFrom Canacona station, it's about 1 km to the Canacona bus stand, where you can bus the 9 km to Agonda. The bus stand is a large building with a white, curved roof. It is visible from the balcony of the Canacona railway station. To get there, walk up the road away from the train station until you reach the main road. Turn right (there will be a railway bridge to your left), and walk for 300m, the building will be on your left. Buses start at 7:35am and run about every hour until 6pm-ish. As with any Indian bus stand, you'll have to ask the people around, although the buses heading in that direction do usually stop near the sign at the bus station that says Agonda.\nAgonda buses leave to go back every 30 mins from the other side of the road to where you get dropped off. The last bus to Canacona leaves Agonda at 6:30pm. If you miss it, the locals can be persuaded to give you a motorbike ride back to the station for about Rs100.\n\nThe bus will drop you off at the northern end of the beach, on a junction near the church.\nThere are a few more buses on the main road, but this means 10-15 minutes walk from the beach centre. The price to Chaudi is Rs7 or 8. To Canacona, about Rs25.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nTaxis and auto rickshaws are a more comfortable  and quicker alternative to the public bus.\nAsk any rickshaw driver or taxi driver and they will take you there from Palolem, Patnem or Chaudi.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nOne or two autos usually stand near the church during the daytime. As always in India, bargain (the normal price to Chaudi or Palolem should be around Rs.50, but many tourists end up paying Rs.100 and more).\n\nMotorbikes and scooters are offered for rent, both by house owners and by the auto guys near the church. A nearly-new Honda Activa or similar should cost Rs.150-200 a day. (200 is a usual starting price, but during the peak period bargaining could be difficult), less if rented for more than a week or two.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nAgonda's beach is very simple and natural. There are some sunbeds but when the tourist police or Canacona local government officials appear, any beach shades, sunbeds, chairs etc. which are outside the confines of the shacks disappear pronto and the beach looks even more gorgeous and makes you realise why you went there and not to some built up resort.\n\nAgonda beach is famous as a Ridley turtle nesting site. These animals are endangered. Please keep the noise level and the lights down at night at the beach to give them a chance to nest. The Panchayat ( village administration) is very invested in not allowing Agonda to become another overcrowded Palolem. Anything you can do to minimize waste, safe water or electricity will be much appreciated since the village is struggling to avoid environmental degradation and preserve its beauty for the next generation. It is very quiet place, not suitable for the party crowd.\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Cabo de Rama"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=Free"],["content=An old fort built by a Hindu king named for Lord Rama, after a few battles, it was eventually taken over by the Portuguese.

Your exit is a sand and stone road going through the dried out landscape, just follow the main track for a few km’s and you’ll find yourself looking down on Cola beach. It’s not all that easy to find this place, but it will be worth your effort. You park your bike or scooter where the road ends, and then there’s a 3-minute walk, down to the beach. Cola beach looks beautiful through the trees from the top of the path. The beach is actually three small bays, separated by large rocks. The middle beach covers a lagoon that stretches back into the jungle. When you walk down the stairs you’ll walk straight into the ‘Blue Lagoon’, the only option for eating and drinking on Cola beach."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nThere are stores stocking basic supplies in Agonda, as well as internet, phone and currency conversion services.

Not all places where you stay will have a restaurant. Nevertheless there are enough to survive upon. Dersey's on the southern end of Agonda beach is one of the restaurants open even during the low season, serving both Indian and local food. There's another (probably year-round) restaurant on the beach road closer to the northern end, but it seems to be overpriced with rates compared or even more than those on Palolem beach. During the high season, more places are opened, but still not too many.\n\nIf you do not afraid local food (and there's nothing dangerous in it, actually) and\/or want to save money, Niki bar on the road to Chaudi (just where the road to Agonda Beach branches from it to the right) serves good fish thalis for a reasonable Rs.30 in what seems to be a local eatery and an afternoon (as he closes his place around 5 PM) drinking point for a few locals. Foreigners are seen there surprisingly often for such a \"local\" place.\n\nSome local shops also do have a few tables and prepare basic food (omelettes, fish & veg thalis, tea, juice, etc.) during the high season, but their price tag is usually more \"touristic\" (less than in restaurants, however, that is Rs.50-60 for a thali). One of them can be found just 50 m right from the church, at the end of the first building with small shops on the left side.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Blue Planet Cafe"],["url=http:\/\/www.blueplanet-cafe.com"],["email="],["address=Agonda"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=off the main Agonda to Palolem road"],["phone = +91 932611894"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=8:30AM-9:30PM"],["price="],["content=Family run organic vegetarian vegan cafe in a beautiful natural setting.

But, as it is Goa, buying drinks is not a problem, at least before 9-10 PM. Restaurants offer beer at least; also, there is a wine shop around 100-150 m to the right from Agonda church and another one in Dersey's. Just opposite the church on the street leading away from the sea, there is a tiny and cheap local bar (small beer Rs.30 \/ big 60, they have Old Monk, etc. also) which is open till the evening. Don't expect many people there, however; you can easily be the only customer even in the evening.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nOnly basic accommodation options are available for stay in Agonda. Outside the main season which is from November to February, you have to arrange for a stay in a Goan family house. Off-season prices there, however, can be really low - for example, in October (when, while it's still humid a bit, most days are sunny) you can rent a room in a nice Portuguese-style villa from around Rs.250 (peak high-season prices for the same could be around Rs.600, or less in the wooden bungalows mostly built between the main street and the beach). While locals are mostly genuinely friendly and there's much less hassle from them than, say, in Palolem, some of them won't think twice before asking three or more times the normal price, especially if they see the person isn't used to the local prices. So, if you're asked much more than expected, bargain or better try another place.\n\nAdvance booking, however, is neither really needed (maybe except for a few peak days around New Year) nor saves any money (in fact, often you pay more).\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Madhu Beach Huts"],["url=http:\/\/www.madhuhuts.com\/"],["email=sandeep@madhuhuts.com"],["address=Agonda Beach"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=center of the beach 100m from the church"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=Rs. 1,800-3,500"],["checkin=noon"],["checkout=11AM"],["content=Luxury beach cottages.
