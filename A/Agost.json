Agost (Valencian pronunciation: [aˈɣost]) is a Valencian town and municipality located in the province of Alicante, Spain, at a distance of about 18 km from Alicante, the capital of the province. Due to its relative distance from the Mediterranean Sea, Agost was not directly affected by the mass tourism that the towns on the Costa Blanca experienced, and has maintained its local character.\n\nUntil the sixties, the economy of Agost was mainly based on pottery and agriculture. Today most of the traditional potteries have closed, or turned into factories producing construction elements. There are still about 11 potteries active in the town; six of them still produce traditional pottery. Agriculture remains a second income source for many families in Agost.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nThe church (Sant Pere Apòstol)\nThe hermitage (Ermita de les Santes Justa i Rufina) built in 1821\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["38.4392"],["-0.6394"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Alicante (province)"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Agost"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Agost"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]}]
