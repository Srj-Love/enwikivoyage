For the purposes of this article, Air Itam begins west of Jl Masjid Negeri and Jl Scotland. \n\nCentral Air Itam is situated around three main streets: Jl Air Itam, Jl Pasar and Jl Balik Pulau. This area is often overflowing with pedestrian activity and a barrage of traffic courtesy of the popular local markets and businesses that help to congest this major, yet tiny road. To the north, along Jl Bukit Bendera, is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Penang Hill"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["Bukit Bendera"]},") base funicular train station. Taking a ride on the funicular lifts you up to the top of the hill, offering scenic views and a much cooler climate.\n\nDirectly to the south of central Air Itam is the township of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bandar Baru Air Itam"]},", more commonly known as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Farlim"]},". Largely a residential area, Farlim runs along Lebuhraya Thean Teik and is littered with housing estates and condominiums.

Expect year round hot and humid days that are often broken with a cooling afternoon shower. Evenings are much cooler than the daytime, but rarely drop below 20Â°C. Being further inland than Georgetown, Air Itam tends to experience slightly less rainfall and lacks the cool breeze that occasionally blows in from the Strait of Malacca. \n\nAs an exception, Penang Hill tends to be much cooler compared to the coastal plains of Georgetown and Air Itam. Elevated 833 m above sea level, Penang Hill offers much welcomed cool climate once described by Isabella Bird, a 19th century travel writer, as 'delicious'.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Mapframe"],["5.40659"],["100.27900"],["zoom=13"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nUsing the extensive ",{"type":"'''","value":["Rapid Penang"]}," public bus network is a cheap and convenient way to reach Air Itam.
