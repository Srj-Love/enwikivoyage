The island was built to be the last point of defence in the Pacific, but Japanese advance was reversed and the island never saw action.

A boat ride of approximately 20 minutes communicates both island. As of September 2006, there was only one inhabitant to the island (Pare), whose family owns the island and runs a small lodge. Akaiami offers little in terms of entertainment, other than hiking, fishing, swimming and kayaking. Its remote location, far from tourists and technology, is the real asset of this small charming island.Akaiami is essentially a fairly remote, quiet, charming, unspoiled islet surrounded by a pristine turquoise lagoon and a coral reef.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car\/scooter"]},"\n\nCar and Scooter (or Moped) hire are the main forms of transport on Aitutaki. This can easily be arranged through any of the rental companies (or better accommodations) on the island. Prices tend to be higher and quality a bit lower than on Rarotonga.\n\nA driver's licence is $2.50 NZD and can be purchased at the police station in Arutanga (also known as town). You will need to present your foreign driver's licence to obtain this. You are not required to have a motorcycle licence on your licence from your home country to obtain a licence for scooters & motorcycles in the Cook Islands; driving down to the police station is typically your practicum, although very rarely they do short tests. The licence is paper with no photo identification and lasts for a year. An Aitutaki driver's licence is cheaper, easier to get, and faster than getting a licence in Rarotonga and your Aitutaki licence will cover you for the whole Cook Islands. Licences in Rarotonga cost $20 with an additional amount for a practical test. There are sometimes lines in Rarotonga at the licence office so if you can avoid it, and you don't want a laminated photo id, the Aitutaki licence is the way to go.\n\nPrices for cars can vary on which model chosen and which company used but typically $65 to $85 a day is usual with a refundable $40 petrol deposit. Cars typically tend to be automatics and are pretty reliable under the hood but will usually have some superficial damage.\n\nThe Aitutaki Lagoon Resort & Spa offers a range of rental vehicles for hire.  Please call (682)31200 or Skype talr.manager or email resort.manager@aitutakilagoonresort.co.ck\n\nScooters are much more economical at $25 a day with a $10 petrol deposit. There is some competition with scooters so if you are not happy with yours you have other options. As with the cars, the scooters are typically in good condition and safe to drive, but will not be vespas or straight out of the box. Typically rentals are automatic, but ask and manuals should be available. Manual scooters can be in better condition because they are not rented as often.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\n\nTaxis are expensive on Aitutaki.
