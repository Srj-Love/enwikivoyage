[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Mena-asia_default_banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Aizawl"]}," is the capital of the state of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mizoram"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["India"]]},". It is the largest city within the state. It is also the centre of all important government offices, the state assembly house and the civil secretariat. Aizawl is the largest city, as well as the capital of the state of Mizoram in India. The city is located north of the Tropic of Cancer in the northern part of Mizoram and is situated on a ridge 1132 metres (3715 ft) above sea level, with the Tlawng river valley to its west and the Tuirial river valley to its east. In the summer the temperature ranges from 20-30 degrees Celsius, and in the winter 11-21 degrees Celsius.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nThis 112-year-old citadel-like city, with its timber houses is set on a ridge at approximately an altitude of 4000 ft above sea level. The city is spread over several mountain ridges with most houses built on 60%+ inclines. Aizawl is a religious and cultural center of the Mizos. Aizawl lies just north of Tropic of cancer. \n\nWith a population of approximately 300,000, it has cloudless blue skies, dewy mornings and sunlit days. These help to ensure the enjoyment of unforgettable holiday pleasures practically all year round. Even the monsoon months are pleasant and gentle.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nThere are three means of getting in to Aizawl, buses, Sumos or aircraft.\n\nBuses run between all the capital cities in the North East states, Guwahati,Shillong and Silchar being the main routes. Sumos are large cars (10 seats) which also run on the major routes.\n\nTwo airlines currently service Lengpui Airport, Jet Airways and Air India with flights from\/to Kolkata & Guwahati.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nAizawl is centred around a mountain ridge which means the roads run more or less parallel to the mountain side. This means if you need to go vertically up or down it will be faster to take a foot path than to go by road. The mountainous landscape also means that the cost of driving a relatively short horizontal distance can be quite expensive and this is reflected in bus and taxi rates.\n\nThere are numerous buses routes that connect the various localities and most will run through the town centre (Dawrpui - North to South and Civil Hospital South to North). Bus fares vary and best is to ask the conductor though a relatively short trip of 1 km cost around Rs 5 (Jan 2012). One thing to note is that there are no buses that run between the airport and the city.\n\nThere are nearly 5000 taxis licensed to ply the roads in Aizawl and are readily available. Rates are extremely high compared to the rest of India. Though there are official published rates, no taxi runs by these rates. The main contention from taxi drivers is that 1 km uphill costs more to run than downhill and with inclines being frequently 30% or more. A relatively short distance of 1 km will cost you around Rs 50. A taxi to or from the airport will cost you around Rs 800 (July 2012) to\/from the central areas of Aizawl. However, the price is liable to go up if petrol prices rise or if a landslide blocks the main road (requiring a longer alternate route).\n\nThere is a taxi firm called Sure Taxis that offers a service to find, negotiate rates on your behalf and dispatch taxis to your location and they don't charge anything to you. They also offer rental cars (comes with a driver) such as Altos, Boleros and Scorpios. Their numbers are: 0389 232 2833 & 0389 232 1494\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["The Mizoram State Museum"]}," near the Chief Minister's Bungalow is worth a visit.
