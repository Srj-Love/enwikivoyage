It is accessible to the public, with bridges spanning creeks, natural and maintained areas, and lots of walking\/biking pathways.\n\nWith many kilometres of walking and bike trails along with park land, the waterfront used frequently by visitors and residents alike. The breeze coming off of Lake Ontario is a feature that lends itself well to kite flying and the park is a popular kite flying destination.\n\nAt the southern end of Harwood Avenue you will find Veterans' Point Gardens, dedicated to the HMS Ajax, the Royal Navy ship after which the Town was named. The Gardens are also dedicated to the Defence Industries Limited (DIL) plant and its workers that made this area their home during World War II. The Gardens are a great place to learn some of our Townâ€™s history and enjoy the lakefront. Public restroom facilities were installed in the fall of 2007.\n\nOn the western side of the waterfront you will find Rotary Park, site of many activities such as Music in the Park in the summer, Canada Day celebrations, and many other special activities. Rotary Park includes a playground and snack bar and it is also the entry point to a long-span bridge across Duffins Marsh where it enters the lake. Across the bridge, the pathway continues into the City of Pickering. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nThere's two hotels in Ajax, The Super 8 at Westney Road and Bayle Street, and The Hilton at Salem Road and the 401.
