The journey takes about 1 hour and usually makes a stop at the larger ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zamami"]]}," island before stopping at Aka Port. There is a cheaper ferry but you will get less time to enjoy the island. Return ferries to Naha usually depart around 5PM and costs about ¥3,000.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nAka can easily be explored on foot, bicycle or kayak. The heat can make moving about difficult but there are plenty of opportunities to jump in the sea and cool off.\n\nThe islands of Geruma (慶留間), population 81, and Fukaji (外地島), population zero plus the airport, are connected to Akajima by bridge.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nVenture around the island to discover remote beaches. There are 3 observation towers on Aka where you can take photographs of Aka's unspoilt beauty. When leaving Aka Port the locals like to wave goodbye and perform acrobatic dives into the sea. Watch out for the giant Okinawan tree spiders if you take the beaten paths down to the sea. There are also deer that swim between the islands.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nSnorkel, scuba dive or kayak from any beach and you will soon encounter a rich variety of tropical sea life.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nBuy snorkeling equipment before you arrive.

The locals are extremely friendly and will soon point you in the right direction. If staying at a local guest house you can  often eat with your hosts.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nThere are plenty of drink vending machines on Aka and you can usually get a cold glass of Orion (Okinawan beer) at any place that sells food.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:AkajimaPort.jpg"],["thumb"],["400px"],["Locals from Akajima Island perform an acrobatic farewell for the evening ferry"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nThere are some guest houses and rooms to hire on Aka but no large hotels.
