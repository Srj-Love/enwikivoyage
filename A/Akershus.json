The public transportation system is relatively good with buses going between the major cities and stopping at bus stops marked with a sign (blue with a white bus on it, rectangular) and\/or an open air booth with the place name written above with white lettering. Public transport is reasonably inexpensive though costs can build up if you buy tickets every time you get on, day\/week\/month\/season passes can be purchased at the major stops.
