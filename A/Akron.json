There's almost nowhere in Akron anyone shouldn't go in the daytime, and very few places at night.\n\nGenerally, the west side of the city near Copley road is regarded as the worst section of town. With a higher rate of violent crimes and theft, it is best avoided by outsiders. Some, but not all, housing projects - most notably Joy Park project  in the vicinity of the Zoo and Elizabeth Park under the All-American Bridge - are also somewhat unsafe and should be bypassed altogether by foot and car.\n\nIf visiting the University of Akron, it's best to stay west of the Market \/ Buchtel intersection.
