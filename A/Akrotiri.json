There have been traces of a prehistoric settlement, but it wasnâ€™t until 1967 when the excavations at the so-called ancient Akrotiri started. The most important excavations, which brought to light multi-level buildings and masterpiece-wall paintings, were conducted by the archaeologist Spryridon Marinatos, a professor at the University of Athens. \nAkrotiti settlement is one of the best preserved all over ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Greece"]]}," and we owe that to the same factor, that caused its destruction. After the eruption of the volcano in the 17 century B.C., the whole island, and Akrotiri as well, has been covered with volcanic material. These material has, however, played major role in the protection of the ancient settlement and especially its wall paintings.\n\nThe archaeological site was closed from 2005-2012 due to a partial collapse of the shelter protecting the site from the elements, but has been regularly open since 2012. For summer 2014 (April-October), opening hours are 8am-8pm Tuesday through Sunday (closed Monday).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nFrom Akrotiri, you can walk to the Red Beach or get a boat to it, which also makes stops at the White Beach and the Black Beach. It is 5 euros return but you don't receive any ticket or receipt (nor do they have the means to give you one). However, there is only one boat so they trust if you come back by it, you must have come so you aren't asked to pay again, only when you leave Akrotiri. The only stop with a pier is Akrotiri so if you intend to get off, tell them explicitly or they won't know to stop (though they often ask) and be prepared to get off directly into the sea and walk through the water to get to the beach. They always stop in waters shallow enough to walk in for adults (highest it comes to is the waist) so it is possible to bring bags, but make sure you can lift them above your head.\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["drink"],["name=Mathios Taverna"],["url="],["email=vmathios@otenet.gr"],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+30 2286081910"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=7 pm to 10 pm"],["price="],["content=Home made meals Greek cooking and family wine."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["drink"],["name=Pool-Bar Mathios"],["url="],["email=vmathios@otenet.gr"],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+30 2286081152"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=10 am to 10:30 pm."],["price="],["content=Light meals, salads, cocktails, Greek cooking, and specialties served around two pools.
