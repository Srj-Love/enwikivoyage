Akumal is one of the most peaceful places in the Riviera Maya one protected shallow bay with a secluded beach and a nearby reef.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe nearest Airport to Akumal is the Cancun International Airport. It is approximately a one hour drive from Cancun.\n\nOne way to get there is by pre-booking a private transfer from the airport.\n\nThere are also buses and shuttles with some hotels or dive shops offering free shuttles.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nUnless you plan on just staying in Akumal, you will need a rental car to get around.  The closest sights are at least a 20 minute drive.  However, if you're not comfortable driving in a foreign country, there are plenty of taxis to take you wherever you need to go.\n\nThere are also ",{"type":"''","value":["colectivos"]},", a local 15-passenger van service that runs between Playa del Carmen and Tulum. They're cheap (20 pesos per person), and usually full, but run very frequently. You can catch the colectivos off the main highway. If you are standing on the side of the highway the driver will flash his lights at you if he has room in his van.  This is the preferred local way of getting around.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Akumal Statue.JPG"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Statue in town"]]},"\n\nAkumal has a beautiful bay with a wide white sand beach, wonderfully warm blue-green water and great snorkeling.  Cute little town with several restaurants.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Snorkeling"]},"\nWith the destruction of hurricane Wilma, the reefs near Akumal were damaged.  However, a snorkeling trip is still very worth the time and expense.\nThere are three options for snorkeling:\n#Go on a tour provided by one of the two dive shops in town.  It is $40 USD per person.\n#Go on an \"unofficial\" tour.  If you stand on the beach with a clueless look on your face, a local may approach you and offer to take you snorkeling on his glass-bottomed boat.  It is usually $20 USD per person and includes snorkeling equipment.  The guide will attempt to find the famous sea turtles for you and show you different corals and fish.  Make sure you are comfortable swimming with flippers as the guide may swim quickly from site to site.  \n#Rent or buy your own equipment and swim out alone.  The coral reefs are not too far from the shore and can be easily accessed by swimming, especially with the help of a life preserver.  Much of the bay is not more than five feet deep.  Be very careful to stay away from the \"fire reef\" marked with buoys and a distinctive red colored coral.  It stings and excessive contact can be fatal.  \nSince coral dies on human contact, you should avoid touching coral at all costs.  It is also illegal to touch the wildlife, such as the sea turtles, so please do not try to ride them or bother them in any way.\nAs of January 2006, there were five juvenile green sea turtles living in the bay.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Other"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Scuba diving"]},".
