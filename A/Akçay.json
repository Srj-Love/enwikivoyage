However beautiful and peaceful the place nowadays may be, there is a tragic love story behind the name of the place, which literally translates \"Hasan was drowned\": Hasan, a young farmer from the lowland village of Zeytinli, fell in love with Emine, a sturdy maiden from the nomadic tribes of the mountain. As a marriage between a sedentary farmer and a nomad was frowned upon, there was no way for Emine to move into Hasan's village, and as such Hasan would have to move to the upland pastures. Emine's family set a condition for Hasan to fulfill, so that he could prove that he would be hardy enough to overcome an austere mountain lifestyle: He had to carry 50 kg of pure salt over the mountains to Emine's tribe. Having failed the objection by knocking down at the halfway, Hasan committed a suicide in one of the ponds in what is now Hasanboğuldu. Emine, upon hearing the death of her lover, has also committed a suicide as well, by hanging herself on one of the plane trees next to the pond."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Campgrounds"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Akcay Camping"],["url="],["email="],["address=Yeni Mahalle"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+90 266 384 28 18"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Gine Camping"],["url="],["email="],["address=Turgut Reis Caddesi"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+90 266 384 11 34"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Pat Camping"],["url="],["email="],["address=Güneş Caddesi"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Saka Camping"],["url="],["email="],["address=Güneş Caddesi"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+90 266 384 37 89"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=Tabliczka E87.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["directionl1=N"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Çanakkale"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Güre"]]}],["directionr1=S"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Izmir"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Edremit"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["39.5858333333"],["26.9238888889"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Northern Aegean"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Akçay"]]}]
