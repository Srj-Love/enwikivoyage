This must be made extremely clear with taxi drivers (who will not be too keen on travelling to Al Jazira themselves).\n\nNote that a HUGE error can be made if a foreigner accepts a ride from someone travelling to Kirkuk or Baghdad-- people from these regions are desensitized in some respects, and will drive around Al Jazira (through its suburbs) to shave off a half hour of driving time (by not driving around the Mosul province).\n\nYou can realise that you're entering Al Jazira province by the flags at the checkpoints.
