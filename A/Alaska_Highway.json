It is primarily in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Canada"]]},".  This itinerary will cover the trip from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dawson Creek"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fairbanks"]]},".  This distance is 2395 km (1488 mi). This is not a Sunday drive.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]}," \n\nThis highway was built during World War II to help the American Military transport equipment to and from Alaska.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Prepare"]}," \n\nGive your car a good mechanical evaluation before you attempt this trip. Sign up for roadside service such as AAA\/CAA, but verify that they will cover the entire cost of towing you long distances. Many services will cover only a few hundred dollars, which is not sufficient.\n\nYou should carry enough emergency supplies to last yourself one or two nights. Most of the highway has NO mobile telephone service. The nearest tow truck can be 1000 km (650 mi) away. It is even more important to carry emergency supplies in winter to avoid hypothermia and death. At the very least, bring food, water, blankets, a first-aid kit, and spare tires. Wintertime temperatures can dive as low as -40 C \/ -40 F. Bug repellent may be very nice to have in the summer.\n\nFor winter driving, you need winter or all-weather tires and low-weight oil (5W30 or as recommended by your manufacturer).\n\nBe sure to verify that you have the appropriate entry documents for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Canada"]]}," or the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United States"]]},", depending on your direction. Note that Canadian immigration can request that you show proof of enough funds to cover your trip and an emergency. A bank\/ATM receipt, a few credit cards, traveler's checks, or cash will suffice. They will refuse entry to Canada if you do not demonstrate enough funding for your trip. \n\nGas (petrol) stations in this part of Canada are frequently ",{"type":"'''","value":["not"]}," 24 h, especially in winter, and most of them do not have a pay-at-the-pump mechanism. Many stations have very long distances between them. You should keep your tank as full as you can and be prepared to wait for a station to open if you arrive in the middle of the night.\n\nCellphone coverage is very sparse, although every Yukon community along the highway has cell service in the vicinity. Do not count on using your cellphone in an emergency.\n\nThe highway may be in various states of repair. Be prepared to wait long periods as road crews continue to maintain the road. Winter frost is extremely hard on the roads. Do not be surprised to see deep fissures across the highway.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]}," \n\nGetting to the Alaska Highway is no small feat in itself.  It starts in Dawson Creek in Northern British Columbia.  You can get to Dawson Creek either by driving north from Southern British Columbia through ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Prince George"]]}," or by driving Northwest from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Edmonton"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Whitehorse"]]}," is the largest city along the highway, until you reach Fairbanks at the end.

Nearly all of the flights are to or from Vancouver, with some schedules to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fairbanks"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Juneau"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alaska"]]},". There is also summertime nonstop or one-stop service to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Frankfurt"]]},", Germany, via Condor airlines ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.condor.com"]},".\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dawson Creek"]]}," does have a regional airport that is served by Central Mountain Air ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/flycma.com"]}," and Hawkair ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/hawkair.net"]},". However, it would not be advisable to try and rent a car in Dawson Creek for this long drive.  It would be more reasonable to rent a car in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Edmonton"]]},". Another alternative would be to rent an RV for this drive.  However, this is usually quite expensive and after the cost of gas, probably more expensive than staying in a hotel every night.  However, with the sparse provision of hotels, having an RV can be more convenient.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nGreyhound serves the highway and terminates in Whitehorse. ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.greyhound.ca"]}," Limited bus service is available between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Whitehorse"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Anchorage"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fairbanks"]]}," as well as points along these routes.
