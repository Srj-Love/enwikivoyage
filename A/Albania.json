Mixed marriages are very common.\n\nTraditional Albanian culture honors the role and person of the guest.  In return for this place of honor, respect is expected from the guest. Albanians enjoy the long walks in the city streets, drinking coffee, and among the younger generations, participating in nightlife activities such as cafe lounging and dancing.\n\nAlbania is a poor country by European standards.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nFollowing the defeat of the Axis powers at the end of World War II, a Communist government was established, presided over by resistance leader Enver Hoxha.  Albania became famous for its isolation, not just from the market-run democracies of Western Europe, but from the Soviet Union, China, and even neighboring Yugoslavia.  Even as the Iron Curtain came down and Communists lost power throughout Eastern Europe, Albania seemed intent on staying the course, alone.\n\nBut in 1992, several years after the death of Hoxha, the Communist party relinquished power and Albania established a multi-party democracy with a coalition government. The transition has proven difficult, as governments have tried to deal with high unemployment, a dilapidated infrastructure, widespread gangsterism, and disruptive political opponents.  Today Albania is moving closer towards neo-liberalism, with EU integration as its goal; Albania signed the SAA on June 2006, thus completing the first major step towards joining.  In 2008 Albania received an invitation to join NATO.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nWith its coastline facing the Adriatic and Ionian seas, its highlands backed upon the elevated Balkan landmass, and the entire country lying at a latitude subject to a variety of weather patterns during the winter and summer seasons, Albania has a high number of climatic regions for so small an area. The coastal lowlands have typically Mediterranean weather; the highlands have a Mediterranean continental climate. In both the lowlands and the interior, the weather varies markedly from north to south.\n\nThe lowlands have mild winters, averaging about 7 °C (45 °F). Summer temperatures average 24 °C (75 °F). In the southern lowlands, temperatures average about 5 °C (9 °F) higher throughout the year. The difference is greater than 5 °C (9 °F) during the summer and somewhat less during the winter.\n\nInland temperatures are affected more by differences in elevation than by latitude or any other factor. Low winter temperatures in the mountains are caused by the continental air mass that dominates the weather in Eastern Europe and the Balkans. Northerly and northeasterly winds blow much of the time. Average summer temperatures are lower than in the coastal areas and much lower at higher elevations, but daily fluctuations are greater. Daytime maximum temperatures in the interior basins and river valleys are very high, but the nights are almost always cool.\n\nAverage precipitation is heavy, a result of the convergence of the prevailing airflow from the Mediterranean Sea and the continental air mass. Because they usually meet at the point where the terrain rises, the heaviest rain falls in the central uplands. Vertical currents initiated when the Mediterranean air is uplifted also cause frequent thunderstorms. Many of these storms are accompanied by high local winds and torrential downpours.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Regions"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Albania Regions map.png"],["thumb"],["right"],["400px"],["Map of Albania with regions colour-coded"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Regionlist"],["region1name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Coastal Albania"]]}],["region1color=#ae86ae"],["region1items="],["region1description=the long narrow strip of between about 10 and 30 km wide along the whole of the Albanian coast, bordering both the Adriatic Sea and Ionian Sea"],["region2name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Northeastern Albania"]]}],["region2color=#6ba1c5"],["region2items="],["region2description=the inland region to the north of the Shkumbin River, bordering Montenegro, Kosovo and Macedonia."],["region3name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southeastern Albania"]]}],["region3color=#71b37b"],["region3items="],["region3description=the inland region to the south of the Shkumbin River bordering Macedonia and Greece, and including the great border lakes, Lake Ohrid and Lake Prespa."]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["image=Tirana Night View.jpg"],["name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tirana"]]}],["alt=Tiranë"],["url="],["lat=41.32780"],["long=19.81858"],["directions="],["content=— the capital.

Generally, furgons cost a little more and go a little faster, but can be uncomfortable over long distances because of the close quarters with other passangers.\n\nBuses are more comfortable and cheaper, and although slower, they run on a time schedule (though it is almost impossible to find a printed schedule anywhere in the country) and are generally well regulated.  There are different bus stations in Tirane for North bound buses (Shkoder, Leizhe, Puke, etc.), South bound buses (Saranda, Gjirokastër, Berat, Vlore, Fier, etc.).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\nLimited services operate between Tirana and Shkodra, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fier"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ballsh"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vlorë"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pogradec"]]},".  The train route from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lezhe"]]}," to Shkodra has scenic beauty. The Tirana-Durres trains (and vice versa) depart up to 8 times a day. The train timetables are available ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/albaniatourism.info\/general-info-page\/getting-around-in-albania\/"]},". The trains in Albania are still in poor condition, despite the route from Tirana to Vlore looking convenient on a map, the more wealthy Albanians never use trains and if not travelling in their own cars, use the many mini-buses. On the other hand, trains offer more space than often overloaded minibuses.\n\nA train ride is a must-see, as there are few such enjoyments in Europe these days. Tickets are very cheap and the journeys are very long, but the views and the atmosphere are usually priceless. Among the things you will see in this unforgettable journey are people working their land with primitive tools, beautiful landscapes and wild terrains, houses under construction with various things hanged on for the bad eye, and a chance to meeting some interesting passengers mainly from rural areas. On most stations you'll find people selling sunflower seeds, fruits, chewing gum and many other different things - very unusual in Europe.\n\nNote that the train from Tiranë to Pogradec in the east of the country first goes west to Durrës, so that the trip from Tiranë to Elbasan takes about hours, while the actual direct distance is about 30 km. So you may consider to take a bus to Elbasan, also because the western part of the country is not nearly as scenic as the eastern part.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nThe roads between the important destinations have been recently repaved and fixed, and offer most of the security measures one would expect on a highway. There are no fees for using the highways.\n\nBeware of minor roads. Road surfaces can be poor, deeply pitted, or non-existent, and sometimes a decent paving can suddenly disappear, necessitating a U-turn and lengthy doubling-back. This is the case for the road between Tirana and Gjirokastër. It seems all the expensive cars in Albania are SUVs, rather than low-slung sports cars - and for good reason. Ask the locals in advance if travelling away from a highway.\n\nHighways have frequent changes in speed limit (sometimes with little apparent reason). And there are frequent police mobile speed checks. Police will also stop you if you have not turned on your car lights.\nEnsure you travel with driving licences and insurance documents (ask your car hire company for these) to present to the police.\n\nCar-driving behaviour on the highways is not as orderly as elsewhere in Europe. Expect cars to pull out infront of you, little use of indicators, and hair-raising overtaking. Lanes on dual or triple carriageways tend to be observed. Also expect pedestrians, horses or donkeys cross highways or walk on them.\n\nNavigation is pretty easy although some maps of the country are out of date or contain errors.\n\nIn the cities, and especially Tirana, many roads are being upgraded, fixed, and renamed. Because of that, traveling by car inside the city will be slow and difficult. Be aware that especially Tirana suffers from great traffic congestion during mornings and midday.\n\nA very nice ride is the Vlorë-",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saranda"]]}," mountain road. It is a typical Mediterranean road and offers an amazing view of the sea from the mountains.\n\nThe road to the top of Dajti mountain is very bad, though does not (just about) require a 4x4.\n\nGypsy and beggar children may approach your car at major stop lights.  Nudge slightly forward to get them off your car and if necessary go into the traffic intersection to get rid of them.  The locals will understand.\n\nNote that, around Greek holiday seasons, including Orthodox Easter, the roads leading to\/from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Greece"]]}," can be crowded with cars with Greek plates of Albanian immingrants going to Albania or returning to Greece after their holidays.\n\nRenting a car is a good option to choose, but the practice is fairly new in the country. Rental companies are available mainly in Tirana Airport, and Tirana proper. Various travel agencies may offer such services as well.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bicycle"]},"\nThere is a lack of respect for people riding on bikes on the highways. Also there are few places to put your bike. These and other challenges make Albania a difficult cycling destination, but a rewarding one. Often, asking around to see if you can stay in somebody's home \/ camp in their garden is the only option. Food and water are easily available in the frequent roadside cafes and bars.\n\nIt is OK to camp in all not strictly private places, and even if the places are private there should be no problems with your stay, ask if you doubt.\n\nBe aware that it's very hard to get parts or repairs of modern bicycles.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By thumb"]},"\n\nHitchhiking is not very common in Albania; however, many people will pick you up if they are able.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nThere are many things to do in Albania.

Albania, like the Balkans in general, has a primarily Turkish influence in its cuisine.  This influence stems from over 400 years of Ottoman rule in the region.  Recent influences after the fall of communism in the early 1990s have been from Italy and Western Europe in general.  Most of what is available in neighboring countries such as Greece and Italy will be available in Albania, particularly in the larger cities.\n\nMany people grow fruits and vegetables around their houses, most popularly all kinds of grapes, (red, black, green), that are used to make ",{"type":"''","value":["raki"]},".\n\nAlbania is a very mountainous country, and these mountains have scattered olive trees that influence Albanian cuisine. Salads are usually made with fresh tomato and onion.

These stews are easy to make, and flexible with ingredients. They include potatoes, onion, rice, etc.\n\nIf going to Albania, expect lamb to be the main meat in many places.

The number of homemade beers, wines and raki is as varied as the population itself; the quality of these drinks is as varied as the quantity available. Non-alcoholic drinks range from the well-known international and regional soft drink brands to the locally produced ones.

At summer, insect repellent should be taken as the mosquito season is very active especially near former swamps and along the Western lowland. Be careful at the beaches because shards of glass and sea urchins are common on the sea floor. Also, pharmacies and other stores are closed from about 12PM-4PM; so, bring all necessary medicine with you. Also, many Albanians smoke cigarettes. It is a normal thing and expect it everywhere. The government has banned smoking in restaurants but this is not really observed.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Respect"]},"\n\nAlbanians are very hospitable. Even more so than the rest of the Balkans, elder males expect to be shown respect on account of their age. Men of the family have to be respected in particular. Shake hands with them and do not argue about topics such as religion and politics. Certain topics are strictly taboo, although they may be fine in the United States or other countries. Homosexuality is one good example. Don't speak about gay rights, no matter what. Just remember that the situation changes a lot according to the location (village or city) and the people with whom you speak as well. Of course, in the hidden north, avoid topics that go beyond local understanding, but be sure that in Tirana you will find very cosmopolitan people that are as open to new ideas as the citizens of Western Europe. There is nothing particular to worry about; all you need to remember is to respect local people as much as you do back home.\n\nSometimes, if you stay for a night or so at someone's house, don't be surprised if you see a big, old AK-47 Kalashnikov staying at the wall. It's pretty normal for Albanians to keep guns in the house.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Traditions"]},"\n\nIn Albania it's common to kiss cheeks of males of your age or younger (if you are a man), even the very first time you meet them. This is especially for the regions of Fier, Tepelena, Vlora and Gjirokastra. In Northern Albania, you will simply touch each other's cheeks, but not kiss them. Women also do kiss one another, sometimes from the very first time they meet, but men and women do not kiss each in the cheek unless they are friends for a long time. Kissing cheeks between young people, 15–20 years old, is however very common. If a baby is in the family, always ask to see him or her, and don't forget to add a compliment (usually \"qenka i shendetshem, me jete te gjate\" or \"what a sweet baby\" works best). If you are a man, or a woman with a group of men, don't compliment females, unless they are under 10–12 years.\nIf you don't speak English, but a language where \"you\" in singular and \"you\" in plural are not the same (like Italian, Greek, German, etc.), be aware that some Albanians do not use the plural form in their language. Sometimes, even the prime-minister is addressed with \"ti\" (you in singular, \"tu\" in Italian, \"Du\" in German or \"Esi\" in Greek), if the journalist is a friend of him. However, when meeting people for the first time, its better if you address them in plural, although they will shortly after ask you to address them in singular.\nPolicemen in Albania are often polite. They usually never stop foreign cars, but if you rent a car, they may stop you. However, when they see you are a foreign tourist, they will immediately tell you to go on (usually with a \"ec, ec, rruge te mbare\" which can be translated in \"go on, have a nice trip\"). When this happens, it's very polite if you respond with a \"faleminderit\" (thank you in Albanian).\n\nAlbanians love dancing, especially during weddings.

This is largely dependent on the amount of rainfall the country receives in any given year, as virtually all of electricity is generated from hydro plants in Albania. However this is becoming more and more rare.Only in Tirana you will not have power outages but expect so in other cities.Although all major cities and most of the towns have back-up generators, however it is best to err on the side of the caution and ask whether the place has a generator or not beforehand in order not to, say, get stuck in an elevator.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\nYou can buy a local sim card for 600 Lek (Vodafone).

Fares can be negotiated between €15 and €20, it takes between 1 and 2 hours. From Ulcinj you can take busses to some of the main cities in Montenegro, including Bar, Budva, Kotor and Podgorica. You can leave by plane from Rinas international airport. You can go to Greece by Gjirokaster at the border crossing at Kavavi. You can leave for Italy from Durres or Vlora. From Saranda you can go to Corfu, Greece. You can go to Kosovo from Kukes on the new highway. There are also border crossings into Macedonia.\n\nCrossing into Macedonia at the border between Pogradec and Ohrid, Macedonia is fairly straightforward. From Pogradec, one can take a taxi to the border - this will likely cost around €5 and take around 10 minutes. Once you get to the border, it is possible to walk into Macedonia, but do not expect to find taxis on the other side of the border. Instead, hire a taxi on the Albanian side (€25, 40 minutes to Ohrid) or wait for the minibus that turns around at the border. This bus comes every few hours and is the same bus that services the Sveti Naum Monastery, which lies a few kilometers from the border. If the bus does not show up, your best option would be to head to monastery's parking lot a few kilometers distant to find the bus(check Google Earth first to get a fix on its location).\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Balkans"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecountry"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["41.3237"],["19.8203"],["zoom=8"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Albania"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Albania"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Europe\/Albania\/"]]}]
