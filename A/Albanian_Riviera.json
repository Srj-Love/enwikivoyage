Keep a close eye on slow moving vehicles, undisciplined drivers and on the road signs. At Fier, enter the city center and onto the new highway linking Fier with Vlore which is being widened as of 2011. From Vlore, continue onto the main road passing Orikum and Llogara Pass. The latter can be quite dangerous as the road is narrow at spots, high elevation means constant braking or frequent gear changes, tight turns and lack of barriers at some places. The typical Mediterranean coastal road that follows will prove very satisfying.
