The house was designed by R.W. Gibson, the architect of the Cathedral of All Saints, for her father, Henry Romeyn Wright, who made a fortune in dry goods during the Civil War. The multiple peaked gables and intricate interior details reflect the Japanese-influenced aesthetic of the 1880s.

Use precautions that one would use in any big city. The areas between Washington Ave. and New Scotland Ave. are generally safe to walk, especially east of Lark Street. However, several acts of physical assault have been committed in recent years near the SUNY Albany downtown campus. Arbor Hill near Henry Johnson Blvd. is known as one of the most dangerous areas, though it holds no particular interest to travelers.

The Cohoes Falls are the second-largest in the state (a distant second to Niagara Falls, but impressive nonetheless). The area in and around the city of Saratoga Springs (about 40 minutes north of Albany) features wonderful shops, restaurants and bars, a national park (about 15 miles from Saratoga proper) at the site of the Battle of Saratoga (the turning point of the Revolutionary War), a lovely State park with a mud and mineral bath spa run by the state, a par 29 and two championship 18 hole courses as well a stately restaurant. Saratoga is most known for its great horse racing track (oldest on the country) and harness racing track.  Victorian visitors came to take the waters at springs.
