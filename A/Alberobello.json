The trullo is a fascinating architectural feature of this area of Puglia, a building with conical roof made without mortar.  Alberobello has special status internationally - designated a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["UNESCO"]]}," world heritage site - because its collection of some 1,500 trulli in an urban environment is unique.\n\nSome of the trulli are now used for stores, restaurants, and lodging. But many are still inhabited by locals, who are very friendly to visitors. As a world heritage site, Alberobello ",{"type":"''","value":["is"]}," a tourist attraction, but as it is less accessible from the tourist-heavy west coast, it is not overrun by tourists, and most tourists of Alberobello are Italians.\n\nThe town is the centre of an annual pilgrimage to the Basilica dedicated to the martyr saints Cosma and Damiano.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nThe easiest way to reach Alberobello is by train.
