Once a small fishing village it has now developed to be a very touristic area. Many holiday makers return year after year because of the lovely beaches, very good climate, proximity of many restaurants, bars and pubs.\n\nThe town is divided into 2 parts, 'The Old Town' and the 'STRIP', or newer town, including Montechoro, Arias de Sao João.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe train station (Albufeira - Ferreiras) is 6 kilometres from the centre. There is a city bus that can take you into town. A small number of taxis are also available, and are generally timed with the train stops . Be sure to grab one quickly, as it may be a while before another one turns up. Although no wifi is offered at the station itself, a small cafe nearby offers free wifi for its customers (and surprisingly delicious pastels de nata!).\n\nTrains to Lagos & Faro take about one hour each. The train to\/from Lisbon takes 3–4 hours. There is now a rapid train that takes 2 1\/2 hours but with more limited runs. A student fare costs €17 (for Portuguese students only).\n\nLong distance buses are also available in the city centre.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get Around"]},"\nThere are local buses that run throughout town - ask your hotel for a timetable.\n\nTaxis are available and can usually be found in the city center.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nCar rental facilities are located in the city center and include major international chains (Hertz, Europcar) as well as local ones. Even for the expert driver, getting around can be quite challenging in Albufeira as there are no street signs to navigate you through the maze-like structure of the endless roundabouts, making maps similarly difficult to interpret. Coupled with the high cost of car rentals, taxis or buses may be simpler modes of transportation.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Castelo de Almoáda"],["url="],["email="],["address=Paderne"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=Free Entrance"],["content=Moorish 12th century castle."]]}]},"\nFishermans beach in the Old Town is the most famous attraction.

Dishes involving different preparations of codfish are plentiful, and the Cataplana styled dishes are well known in this region. Shellfish such as prawns, lobster, and crab tend to be very expensive, while fish is much more affordable.
