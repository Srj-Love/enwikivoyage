In the 1880s the railroad came to town, and almost overnight a new city grew up around the train tracks a couple of miles away from the original settlement. This \"New Town\" became the hub of commerce for the state, and the city grew exponentially (eventually the \"New Town\", which today is Downtown, and the original \"Old Town\" settlement were joined to become part of the same city).\n\nIn the 1920s the federal government officially recognized a series of highways that ran from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chicago"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Los Angeles"]]}," as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Route 66"]]},", and Albuquerque was one of the towns \"The Mother Road\" passed through. Starting in the 1950s, Albuquerque grew exponentially given federal investment in the local military bases and a massive influx of visitors and new residents, and for the most part it hasn't slowed down. Today, Albuquerque is still the hub of commerce and transportation in the state. While Santa Fe is the state capital and the principal tourist destination of New Mexico, Albuquerque is the state's only truly urban area, with a city population of over 500,000 and a metropolitan population of nearly a million people. This is where you'll find the headquarters of the state's businesses, the University of New Mexico, and the Albuquerque International Sunport, the only major airport in the state.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Imperial"],["janhigh = 47"],["febhigh = 53"],["marhigh = 61"],["aprhigh = 70"],["mayhigh = 79"],["junhigh = 89"],["julhigh = 92"],["aughigh = 89"],["sephigh = 82"],["octhigh = 71"],["novhigh = 57"],["dechigh = 48"],["janlow = 23"],["feblow = 27"],["marlow = 33"],["aprlow = 41"],["maylow = 50"],["junlow = 59"],["jullow = 64"],["auglow = 63"],["seplow = 56"],["octlow = 44"],["novlow = 31"],["declow = 24"],["janprecip = 0.5"],["febprecip = 0.4"],["marprecip = 0.6"],["aprprecip = 0.5"],["mayprecip = 0.6"],["junprecip = 0.6"],["julprecip = 1.3"],["augprecip = 1.7"],["sepprecip = 1.1"],["octprecip = 1"],["novprecip = 0.6"],["decprecip = 0.5"],["janh2o ="],["febh2o ="],["marh2o ="],["aprh2o ="],["mayh2o ="],["junh2o ="],["julh2o ="],["augh2o ="],["seph2o ="],["octh2o ="],["novh2o ="],["dech2o ="],["description = ",{"type":"{{","value":[["forecastNOAA"],["Albuquerque"],["35.08"],["-106.66"]]}]]},"\nAlbuquerque is in the high desert [35.11N −106.64W (Elev. 4989 ft\/1521 m)] and has a generally warm, dry climate with four distinct seasons.

Summers are hot (highs average 90–95°F\/34°C, and temperatures near 100°F\/38°C are not rare) and still mainly dry, but monsoonal conditions develop in July or August and produce furious if short-lived thunderstorms.

There is also commuter service to destinations within New Mexico provided by New Mexico Airlines.\n\nOne tip: If you're prone to airsickness, try to get flights into this airport that arrive either before noon or after sundown, particularly during late spring and early summer. The high elevation, hot sun, and spring winds combine to produce thermals that can make afternoon arrivals an extremely bumpy proposition. There are no major safety issues (the airport's runways are long, owing to the adjacent Air Force base, with no nearby obstacles to run into), but try telling your stomach that! The rough ride is less of a problem with outbound flights.\n\nIncidentally, this airport contains a number of attractive displays of New Mexican arts and crafts, and is a more pleasant place than most airports to kill time while waiting for a flight.

In much of the city, the major roads are lined primarily with businesses with residential mazes on the insides. The city is divided into four quadrants, with street addresses taking the form \"12345 Main St. (NE\/NW\/SE\/SW)\" in which the NE\/NW\/SE\/SW suffix denotes the quadrant of the city containing the address. The railroad tracks, which run parallel to I-25, are the east–west dividing line, and Central Ave. is the north–south dividing line. Thus, the street address 3600 Menaul NE would be north of Central and east of the railroad tracks. This nomenclature, while useful in helping you with maps and directions, has the drawback that you can't tell whether a street runs north–south or east–west simply by looking at the address.\n\nBy and large it's difficult to get truly lost in Albuquerque, thanks in large part to the looming presence of the Sandia Mountains to the east. If you can also remember that I-25 runs north–south, I-40 runs east–west, and the Rio Grande runs along the bottom of the valley in the western part of the city, you should be able to make your way around the city without too many problems.

KKOB-AM, 770 on the dial, seems to be fairly reliable for these reports. The interchange of I-40 and I-25 is commonly called \"The Big I\", and you will hear it referred to as such in traffic reports. Traffic congestion, while not nearly as horrible as some of the other cities in the Western U.S., can still get bad during the rush hour and on Saturdays. The two interstates and the river crossings usually have the worst congestion.\n\nMany Albuquerqueans seem to consider I-40 and 25, which run through the city, to be their own personal expressways. The lack of turn signal usage is a running joke for most Albuquerque drivers, so watch for cars changing lanes without warning. However, Interstate traffic usually flows around the pace of the speed limit.\n\nKeep in mind that driving while talking on your cell phone is illegal in Albuquerque unless you use a hands-free system.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cabq.gov\/transit\/ ABQ RIDE"]}]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["+1 505"]}," 243-RIDE, is Albuquerque's public transit system although it's a driving city, and until very recently the city was not trying to make any great strides in its public transit system.

This apparently is driven in part by the infamous lodging shortages during the Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta in October.  The result is that during other parts of the year, affordable hotels shouldn't be too hard to find.  Even with the growth in the hotel market, lodging can be tight for the Fiesta, so if you're coming then, reserve well in advance—months rather than days.\n\nFor some free lodgings try looking for cafes where bands are playing (normally on the weekends) and ask among the punk kids and see if they'll help.

The section from the train tracks (eastern edge of downtown) to University Blvd. can be a little scary in the evening.  Even in Downtown, while Central Avenue is passable, smaller nearby streets such as Copper Street can be scary after dark. The Nob Hill\/UNM district (between University and Carlisle) is perfectly safe at night, but Central gets progressively seedier east of Carlisle, and can get quite scary around the Fairgrounds. Consider the bus or a cab through these areas after the sun goes down.\n\nDue to its size and mild climate, the streets of Albuquerque are considered home to many people. While not typically a danger, do expect to meet up with beggars and vagrants, particularly around UNM.\n\nIf you're going to be engaging in outdoor recreation (even as laid-back as watching an Isotopes day game), slather on the sun screen.  The elevation of the city is 5000 ft or higher, and there is usually not much cloud cover, so one can get a bad sunburn in surprisingly short order.\n\nAlso, New Mexico is very arid.  That, and its high altitude results in very low humidity in both summer and winter, which can lead to dehydration.  Drink plenty of water. A common complaint among visitors from lower altitudes is a persistent headache, which is often mistaken for altitude sickness, but is really a common symptom of dehydration. Consider carrying a water bottle and drinking frequently throughout the day if you don't already.\n\nBe forewarned about New Mexican cuisine; if you're not used to green chile, go easy at first.  Many first-timers have tried to eat the hottest chile they could find, only to discover six hours later that it was MUCH hotter than they remembered.
