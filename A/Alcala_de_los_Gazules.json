Local specialities include game - wild boar or \"jabali\", venison, rabbit or partridge; hot gazpacho (soup thickened with breadcrumbs) and, in early June, tiny snails in broth (known as Caracoles). Fruit and vegetables are essentially seasonal; some, like wild asparagus or the fruits of the chumbo (prickly pear) are harvested from the countryside around the village.

Tinto de verano (red wine and lemonade or soda with ice and lemon) is a refreshing alternative to beer on a hot day.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nHotel La Palmosa***, Área de Servicio La Palmosa (Ctra.
