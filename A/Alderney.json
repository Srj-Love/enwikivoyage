The island itself is only 3 miles long by 1.5 wide.\n\nThe main concentration of houses and shops is in the centre of the Island in the town of St Anne - often referred to simply as 'Town'. The Parish of St Anne's includes the whole of the Island.\n\nAlthough the Auregniais (Alderney Norman-French) language eventually died out in the early part of the 20th century, the signs leading to Town are bilingual, reading 'Town\/La Ville', presumably to assist visiting French yachtsmen and day-trippers.\n\nThe parish of St Anne is served by a magnificent, almost cathedral-like parish church in the centre of Town.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nAlderney is the third largest of the Channel Islands, and the most northerly. It is often said that Alderney is the only Channel Island since it is the only one that is actually in the English Channel\/La Manche. (Guernsey, Jersey and the smaller islands are actually in the Bay of St Malo)\n\nLike the other islands Alderney is a self-governing Crown Dependency. It has its own parliament, the 10 member States of Aldeney which sits 10 times a year. Alderney is also part of the Bailiwick of Guernsey which in modern terms is effectively a customs union including Guernsey and Sark (but not Jersey). In addition, because of an agreement made between Alderney, the UK and Guernsey after the Second World War, Guernsey takes responsibility for providing a number of public services on Alderney (e.g. health, education, the airport etc.). These 'transferred services' as they are known, are provided by Guernsey in return for the right to collect direct and indirect taxes in Alderney at the same rate as in Guernsey.\n\nDue to its location in the English Channel and its proximity to the French port of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cherbourg"]]},", it has often been seen to be strategically important, despite the treacherous waters that surround it. In the 19th century, a large breakwater - the longest in the UK - was built at Braye in order to form a harbour sheltered from the Swinge tidal race.  Although it was never completed, its spectacular remains form the modern harbour. During World War II the island was occupied by German forces, including the SS, and four forced labour camps were built. Although not an extermination camp in the same sense as e.g. Dachau and Buchenwald, very many forced labourers, particularly from Eastern Europe, were worked to death, and there is a memorial to them near to Saye (pronounced 'Soy') which is a must-see.\n\nThe uninhabited islet of Burhou, off the northwest end of the island, is an important nesting area for seabirds. The former farmer's cottage on Burhou can be rented from the Government, and is used for 'get away from it all' holidays by a number of Alderney residents.\n\nTo the south of the islands, separating Alderney from the Cherbourg peninsula, is the Alderney Race (Raz), notorious for is extremely strong currents and rough seas. Despite the hazards presented by Alderney's rocky coastline and the hazards of the Swinge and Race, Braye harbour is a popular destination for yachtsmen and in summer the harbour is full of boats of all kinds, from small RIBs to multimillion pound luxury yachts.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["By air"]},"As of January 2011, there are daily flights from Southampton (with ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.aurigny.com Aurigny Air Services"]}," There are also daily flights from Guernsey.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["By sea"]},{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.manche-iles-express.com Manche-Iles Express"]}," operate summer ferry services from Dielette in France and Guernsey to Alderney.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nAlderney is a small island, and in good weather, there's really nowhere that isn't within walking distance.

Crime is rare and the little crime is fairly minor.  People generally leave doors unlocked and often leave vehicles unsecured with the keys in the ignition. However, do not emulate the locals in this regard. If you have a hire car and it is 'borrowed', you will find you will not be insured when it is discovered in a damaged state on one of the unmade roads having been used to get to a German bunker for an after-hours party. This seems to happen to at least one unlucky local every year. Every summer, the police remind people to lock cars and remove their keys for that reason.\n\nPublic order offences are not as rare as the locals would have you believe. Unlike the UK, which has liberalised its drinking laws, Alderney observes strict licensing hours, which, although formerly the longest in the British Isles, are now probably the shortest. In the winter, no alcohol may be served after midnight, and all premises must close by 12.30. In the summer, these hours are extended by half-an-hour.\n\nAlderney, like the UK, Ireland, Jersey and Guernsey, has now banned smoking in public places. Sark remains the only Channel Island with a pub where smoking is permitted.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Guernsey"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Alderney"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["49.714444444444"],["-2.2052777777778"]]}]
