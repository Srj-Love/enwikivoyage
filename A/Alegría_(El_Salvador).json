The laguna grows a brilliant green especially in bright sunlight, which is caused by the sulfur and other minerals found in the craters volcanic clay.  It is a favorite spot among El Salvadorans and its common to see locals trekking out hunks of the clay which they use for medicinal purposes. There are several picnic tables and large rocks to congregate around. The laguna itself is only deep in the very center although most El Salvadorans will not swim in the laguna. There is a myth that a mermaid lives in the laguna which drowns handsome young men.  The cobblestone path is roughly 1.5 miles long and is a moderate hike through coffee plantations. The road will end at the entrance to the laguna and a small tienda is just to the left of the entrance."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Restaurante Mi Pueblito"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=close to northwest corner of Parque Central"],["phone=+503 2628 1038"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=8AM-4PM"],["price="],["content=Nice terrace."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Cartagena"],["url="],["email="],["address=Final Barrio El Calvario"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+503 2628-1131"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=Main dish from $5"],["content=Good fish and ceviche.
