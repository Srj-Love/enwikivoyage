It is very strong and should be sipped, rather than gulped. \n\nAmong all the Alentejo region you will find a lot of wonderful places to stay. Try Herdade dos Barros (country hotel) in Terena (Évora), there you will find personalized services, comfortable rooms, privacy, description, good taste and good atmosphere. There you will wake up to the sounds of birds, enjoy nature, relax, hiking, read a good book on the terrace, or just watch the scenery with a glass of wine. When night falls you will have a magnificent starry sky, and fall asleep to the sounds of crickets.\nBut if you want a little more movement, you can explore all the historical and cultural heritage of the region (the Castle, the Chapel of Boa Nova, etc.) very close to the farm; enjoy the calm waters of the dam Lucefecit (100 m the Herdade); or visit the neighboring regions, such as Vila Viçosa, Monsaraz, Évora, Alqueva, Badajoz, etc.\nFor more information: http:\/\/www.herdadedosbarros.com ; (00351 964310216)\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lisboa"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Faro"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tomar"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Castelo Branco"]]},".\nFollow one of the motorways or the IP2.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Portugal"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Alentejo"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Europe\/Portugal\/Regions\/Alentejo\/"]]}]
