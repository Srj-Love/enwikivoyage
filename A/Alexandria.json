The lighthouse was built on 3 floors: a square bottom with a central heart, a section octagonal average and above an upper section.

And while much of the city is badly in need of a lick of paint, history both ancient and modern is everywhere if you peer closely enough: the French-style parks and the occasional French street sign survive as a legacy of Napoleon, one of Alexandria's many conquerors, and the few remaining Greek restaurants and cafés still dominate the cultural scene.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh =   18.4"],["febhigh =   19.3"],["marhigh =   20.9"],["aprhigh =   24"],["mayhigh =   26.5"],["junhigh =   28.6"],["julhigh =   29.7"],["aughigh =   30.4"],["sephigh =   29.6"],["octhigh =   27.6"],["novhigh =   24.1"],["dechigh =   20.1"],["janlow =   9.1"],["feblow =   9.3"],["marlow =   10.8"],["aprlow =   13.4"],["maylow =   16.6"],["junlow =   20.3"],["jullow =   22.8"],["auglow =   23.1"],["seplow =   21.3"],["octlow =   17.8"],["novlow =   14.3"],["declow =   10.6"],["janprecip =  52.8"],["febprecip =  29.2"],["marprecip =  14.3"],["aprprecip =  3.6"],["mayprecip =  1.3"],["junprecip =  0.01"],["julprecip =  0.03"],["augprecip =  0.1"],["sepprecip =  0.8"],["octprecip =  9.4"],["novprecip =  31.7"],["decprecip =  52.7"],["description = Source: ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.worldweather.org\/059\/c01268.htm World Meteorological Organization"]}]]},"\n\n: ",{"type":"''","value":["See also: ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Egypt#Climate"]]}]},"\n\nAlexandria has a hot desert climate (BWh), but highly influenced by sea breeze, with sunny hot humid summers and mild moderately wet winters.

No taxi ride between any two points in the city should cost more than 25LE.

The routes are usually along the main streets, with drivers following well-known routes. The routes are written in Arabic on the sides of the vehicle, but even if you speak Arabic this may not be helpful; the drivers sometimes change routes without changing their signage.
