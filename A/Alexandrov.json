The residence is now transformed into a convent and preserves noteworthy architectural sights, while the city itself is quite unremarkable.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Geography"]},"\nAlexandrov is located on the eastern edge of ",{"type":"''","value":["Klin-Dmitrov ridge"]},", a series of hills lying north from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]},". The city stands on the banks of the tiny river Seraya, the left tributary of the Sherna that further flows into the Klyazma. The area near Alexandrov is very typical for the central part of Russia: it is a nearly flat land with vast forests and small fields. Alexandrov is an important transport hub, the crossing of the principal ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]},"–",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yaroslavl"]]}," railway and the circular railway line around ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]}," (the so-called ",{"type":"''","value":["Big Ring of Moscow Railway"]},").

However, the official foundation date is 1513, when Vasili III, the Grand Prince of Moscow, built a residence, fortifications, and first stone churches on the banks of the river Seraya. At that time, the settlement was known as ",{"type":"''","value":["Alexandrova sloboda"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["Alexandrovskaya sloboda"]},", which means that it was an independent community exempt from taxes and duties. In 1564, Ivan the Terrible, the son and the successor of Vasili III, made Alexandrov his permanent residence. He suffered from defeats in the war with Lithuania and felt constant fear of treason. Then, he decided to leave Moscow and to escape from the nobility in Alexandrov. Alexandrov shortly became the actual center of the country: for example, one of the first printing factories appeared here in 1568. However, some negative things appeared as well.\n\nTo protect himself, Ivan the Terrible organized a special army called ",{"type":"''","value":["oprichnina"]},". This army had superior rights and did not hesitate to rob and murder others (first of all, nobility and merchants). This made Alexandrov a strange and sorrowful place where Ivan the Terrible combined orthodoxal religiousness with the savageness and depravity. The flourish of Alexandrov lasted for 17 years, until 1581. In the fall of 1581, Ivan the Terrible killed his son (this accident is shown in the well-known painting by Ilya Repin) and left Alexandrov forever.\n\nThe town rapidly decayed and also suffered from Polish army during the Time of Troubles (1598-1613). In 1654, the former residence was transformed into a convent and later used as a place of exile. Alexandrov is officially considered a town since 1778. It gained the regular rectangular layout and later (1870) hosted the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]},"–",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yaroslavl"]]}," railway. In 20th century, Alexandrov was strongly industrialized and lost nearly all of its original buildings.
