Roughly speaking it is orientated North to South.  The Avenida Virgen del Carmen is the main road that runs along the water front.  The ferry port is about midway along the Abenida del Carmen - it can't really be missed as dozen of signs are pointing in its direction and there is constant ferry traffic in and out of the port.  There is also an elevated heliport right in front of the ferry port.\n\nThe main shopping streets, together with the town square and central market, are set back behind the Avenida Virgen del Carmen and are mainly pedestrianised.  There is a wide range of shops here, from local food shops and boutiques to the main brands.\n\nThe bus and railway stations are close together, about 300m west (and slightly to the south) of the fery port in the main town.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nThe Algeciras train station is located 300 metres west of the port entrance.
