It is a large city with a  population of over 3 million.\n\nWhile downtown Algiers looks modern, the capital is struggling to keep up with rapid growth.  The standard of living for many of its population is poor. Algiers has also been marred by violence in the past decade. A civil war which started in 1991 destroyed much of the country. In recent times things (in Algiers at least) have returned to normal.  Substantial reconstruction of the infrastructure has taken place and is still ongoing.\n\nAlgiers is known locally as El-Djazaïr and the residents speak Berber, Arabic and French.\n\nAlgiers is not a considered a popular tourist destination and the US State Department does warn against travel to certain other parts of the country. In Algiers, most of the interesting sights are in the old part of the city known as the Casbah or Medina. The travelers that do make it to Algiers are impressed with the very friendly and hospitable people.
