One of a three key Moorish towns in Southern Spain, the others being Cordoba and Seville. It is situated at the foot of the Sierra Nevada mountains, at the confluence of three rivers, Beiro, Darro and Genil.\n\nOf course Granada is world famous for the Alhambra Palace. It is one of the most renowned historical sites in the world. A trip to this part of Spain would not be complete without visiting the Palace. It is advisable to book tickets online to avoid disappointment it costs 12 euros for the day, there are a number of different ticket options available.\n\nThe town itself is well worth spending some time in. The Albaicin is the old Arabic quarter, a maze of winding alleyways and streets, with cafes and Arabic teterias (teahouses) with their cool, dark fragrant interiors they beckon visitors out of the bright sunlight, a place where you can treat yourself to sweet pastries and drink aromatic teas around traditional, three-legged sinya tables. There are fantastic shops selling rugs, lamps, mirrors, furniture, jewelry and clothes. As you climb the winding streets you are offered glimpses of the fabulous Alhambra on the opposite side of the valley. The locals say that, to understand it, you need to spend time in \"el Corazon de su Corazon\" - at the heart of its heart. Finding that heart, through its maze of cobbled, winding streets, is not so easy. A great place to take photos of the Alhambra is in the plaza at the top of the hill (Mirador de San Nicolas Church) many people gather here every evening as the sun is setting, as it is such a good view and there is great soft orange light on the Alhambra.\n\nChurch of Santa Ana and Plaza San Nicolas. Half way up this hilly district is the 16th-century church of Santa Ana whose bell tower is a converted minaret. Nearby is an original, working Baños Arabes, beautifully restored with brick-vaulted ceilings, star-shaped skylights and wall mosaics. Narrow streets run between whitewashed houses called carmenes. These were homes built by wealthy Arabs between the 12th and 15th centuries who hid their prosperity behind high walls, but the gates and grilles reveal some wonderful secret gardens, geometrically-designed with Moorish patios, fountains and a profusion of fruit trees, plants and flowers.\n\nSacromonte the gypsies and flamenco guitarists Quarter. The Albaicin morphs into Sacromonte via a barely noticeable fountain, but the atmosphere subtly changes. This is the home of an ancient and still considerable gitano population from whose clans many of Spain's best flamenco guitarists, singers and dancers have emerged. The gypsies originally lived in caves carved out of the hillside – some still do, although the majority have been converted into attractive tourist apartments, restaurants and night clubs. The area still has an anarchic energy, fed by late-night flamenco zambras. Although there are a few bona fide flamenco clubs, sadly most of these once-spontaneous gypsy festivities have become blatantly contrived for tourists, with entrance priced at anything the gitaro hosts feel like charging in exchange for a quick show and a small sherry. But this is still a barrio well worth experiencing. During Semana Santa, when religious statues are paraded through the streets, the mix of incense, candles and singing creates a highly-charged atmosphere.\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Trail Run Spain"],["url=http:\/\/www.trailrunspain.com\/"],["email="],["address=Casa de la Inquisition"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Located in historic quarter"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Varies"],["price=See website"],["content=Running and Training ‘holidays’ based in the Comarca de Alhama and Poniente Granadino regions of Granada Province, Andalucia.

Run by Josephina and Paco. This place has very friendly service and in the colder months they place trays of hot olive wood coals (Braseros) under your table to keep you warm. Fantastic! Try a media plate of the Setas (fleshy mushrooms) and the calamari plancha (grilled squid) - both fantastic with a cold beer or drop of tinto verano (red wine and lemonade cooler).\n\nLe Seguriya: proper sit down restaurant, run by Paco and Lola. Great food and relaxed atmosphere. There is a fantastic terrace overlooking the gorge and there are rooms available since it is also a \"Hotel Rural\".\n\nMeson Diego: Great for 'menu del dia' served every weekday lunchtime - around 8 euros for 2 \/ 3 courses. The terrace is a suntrap, which is great for most of the year, but it can be a bit hot in summer, there is an air conditioned restaurant inside.\n\nBar Andalus: Also do a great 'menu del dia' served every weekday lunchtime - around 8 euros for 2 \/ 3 courses. Again catches the Sun.\n\nBar Gallega: modern bar, serving great and interesting tapas.\n\nLa Boega: Great, down to earth bar, with good breakfasts. Really good, generous tapas.\n\nEl Encutentro: Young modern bar that stays open until late.\n\nEl Tigre: Is the small bar in the corner of Calle Fuerte and Alta De Mesones. By the top corner of Constitution. In the summer season, they have control of a big space at the top of the square. Antonio the owner has a real flair for classic tapas with a twist.\n\nAl Dente: A very good home made Italian pizza place.\n\nLa Crème: This is an ice cream and coffee shop. Also one of the best places in town to get a fresh loaf of bread.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Near the Lower Square"]},"\n\nChurreria De Ascencion: Right on the main (Granada) roundabout - the sign over the door says 'Hamburguesa'. Specialize in churros, a sweet Spanish delicacy for breakfast, served in a big spiral of doughnut type thing - cooked fresh whilst you wait. You dip your hot chorros in an amazing, thick, real chocolate drink. An experience you must do at least once, be warned you may have to put the diet on hold for the day. Friendly staff and very clean bathrooms. You can also get a beer here later in the day. Hamburgers look pretty good too.\n\nBar Rincon: Is next to the children's play area in the bottom square, so is an ideal place to have a drink whilst the keeping an eye on the kids playing a few metres away. Rincon serves all the usual coffee, beer, wine food etc. and is very good.\n\nTasca Casa Marin: in a little street just behind the 2nd (Loja) roundabout. A little gem of a place specialising in fantastic Iberico ham and mature cheeses - a real foodie paradise.\n\nCafe 25: Our nineteen year old 'city wise' daughter loves this place. Quite loud music and I’m told the ice cream is great!\n\nRafa bar: Is the place where all the teenage kids hang out, table football and pool. Usually doesn't get going until 10.30 apparently.\n\nInternet café: on Carretera Loja right hand side walking out of town, around 50 metres from the second roundabout.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Restaurants up the gorge by the small lake"]},"\n\nEl Ventorro: They serve very very good food in this restaurant it is 25 minutes walk from town up the gorge, or a 5 minute drive. There is a biggish menu, we had the menu del dia, which was excellent. They have recently opened a spa facility here, which is great. 15 euros for a couple of hours of steam, pool, jacuzzi etc... or treat yourself with a massage for an extra 15 euros. There is a half price day on Tuesdays. You will usually need to book ahead here as space is limited.\n\nPato Loco: Huge restaurant with a huge swimming pool, food is good.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nThere is a good selection of rental properties on the owners direct website.
