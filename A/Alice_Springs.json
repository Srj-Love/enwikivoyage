It embodies the hardy outback of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Northern Territory"]]},"'s ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Red Centre"]]},", and is a travel hub for sights and hikes in the region, such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Uluru"]]}," (formerly known as Ayers Rock), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kata Tjuta"]]}," (formerly known as the Olgas) and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Watarrka National Park"],["Kings Canyon"]]},". Since the start of the tourist boom in the early eighties, the population has substantially grown to about 28,000. Although Surface water is a scarce commodity in the region, there's plenty underground! It is a great town and well worth a visit!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nAlice Springs is located 1500 km from the nearest major city, being Darwin to the north or Adelaide to the south.  As a result, the people that inhabit the town are often quite ingenious when it comes to making things last!\n\nAlso, due to this distance, you may find that some things can cost more than in the cities, such as fruit and veg, and some clothing (if you forgot to pack your singlet or jacket!).  Over all, however, the town isn't too expensive when it comes to the necessary requirements.\n\nSomething else to remember is that hotels in Alice Springs are rated slightly different to those in European or American countries - as hotels are rated on their facilities rather than the actual rooms.  The reason for that is due to the distance that Alice Springs is from anywhere and the difficulties involved in getting building materials.  Mind you, the star ratings reflect the quality of the establishment.\n  \n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Indigenous History"]},"\n\nThe Arrernte (pronounced Arrenda) Aboriginal people have made their home in the Central Australian desert in and around Alice Springs for more than 50,000 years. The Aboriginal name for Alice Springs is Mparntwe.  Three major groups Western, Eastern and Central Arrernte people live in Central Australia, their traditional land including the area of Alice Springs and East\/West MacDonnell Ranges. They are also referred to as Aranda, Arrarnta, Arunta, and other similar spellings.\n\nArrernte country is rich with mountain ranges, waterholes, and gorges; as a result the Arrernte people set aside 'conservation areas' in which various species are protected.  According to the Arrernte traditional stories, in the desert surrounding Alice Springs, the landscape was shaped by caterpillars, wild dogs, travelling boys, sisters, euros (Kangaroo like creature) and other ancestral figures.\n\nThere are many sites of traditional importance in and around Alice Springs, such as Anthwerrke (Emily Gap), Akeyulerre (Billy Goat Hill), Ntaripe (Heavitree Gap), Atnelkentyarliweke (Anzac Hill), and Alhekulyele (Mt. Gillen).  Many Arrernte people also live in communities outside of Alice Springs.\n\nPronunciation of these Arrernte words can be very difficult.  The reason for that is that Arrernte, and indeed every indigenous language of Australia was not written.  When Europeans arrived with their missions to convert people to Christianity, they felt the need to have the language written, and using their own languages put the written form to the language.  As a result of the missionaries being mostly German, they used their own language to develop the Arrernte written language.\n\nDon't worry if you can't pronounce it, everyone in town knows the places by their European names.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Modern History"]},"\n\nIn 1862, John McDouall Stuart led an expedition into Central Australia and the area where Alice Springs is located. Until the 1930s, however, the town was known as Stuart. The Overland Telegraph Line linking Adelaide to Darwin and Great Britain was completed in 1872. It traced Stuart’s route and opened up the interior for permanent settlement. It wasn’t until alluvial gold was discovered at Arltunga, 100 km east of Alice Springs, in 1887 that any significant settlement occurred.\n\nThe telegraph station was sited near what was thought to be a permanent waterhole in the normally dry Todd River and was optimistically named Alice Springs after the wife of the former Postmaster General of South Australia, Sir Charles Todd. The Todd River was named after Sir Charles himself. The original mode of transportation in the outback were camel trains, operated by immigrants from Pathan tribes in the North-West frontier of the then British India and Pakistan who were misnamed ‘Afghan’ Camellers.\n\nCattle Stations opened up the interior of Australia, with stations the size of small European Countries running mostly Cattle.  Camels were (and still are) farmed in Central Australia - and the exporting of Camels to the Middle East is a fast developing industry.  This is because the Australian Camels are a purebred of camel, and often free from the diseases which can be prevalent in the Middle Eastern countries.\n\nDuring World War 2, Alice Springs was an important location for the Northern defense of Australia, and was a staging point for the allies movements to defeat the Japanese Imperial forces.  Alice Springs' importance grew when it was established that coastal shipments to Darwin were no longer safe.  Lots of relics from World War Two are still in use today in Alice Springs, primarily the Alice Springs Airport, which was constructed as a result of the War.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the war, there was still a large American influence in the town, and as a result, a number of covert locations were set up in and around Alice Springs to monitor world events.  One of these was a Seismic Vault, which was a bunker of sorts, dug into a mound, and which held instruments such as seismographs and other instruments to detect the ground movements of possible nuclear testing in the (at the time) USSR.  One of these bunkers was recently 'discovered' and is now heritage listed.\n\nThe 1960s saw the establishment of the Joint Defence Space Research Facility, or as it's locally known, \"Pine Gap\". The facility was established in the 1970s and is the only area in Australia with Prohibited airspace - so forget about seeing it up close.  You may, however, see it on approach or departure from Alice Springs Airport.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Tourism "]},"\n\nTourism is a major industry in Alice Springs, with well developed facilities for travelers. Visit the Alice Springs Visitor Centre ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.centralaustraliantourism.com"]},", located at 60 Gregory Terrace, at the south end of Todd Mall, for Visitor Guides, maps, tour and accommodation bookings, and suggested itineraries.

Heavitree Gap was named by William Mills, a surveyor of the Overland Telegraph line.  He named it in honour of his former School in Devon (UK).\n\nThe roads around Alice Springs are generally flat and tend to skirt a lot of the hills, some of which are sacred sites to the local Indigenous people.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nThere is an airport in Alice Springs.

Socio-economic tensions which stem from Australia's colonial history have led to the development of impoverished Indigenous communities, known as 'camps', in and around the town, and alcohol-fuelled violence remains a significant problem in the community. Exercise extreme caution when walking around after 10pm, as large groups of inebriated Indigenous youths are notorious for causing trouble in the city. Todd Street is nauseatingly well-policed, so problems in the CBD are less of an issue than they were previously.\n \nFrom time to time you may  be asked for money or other items while in Alice Springs.  According to Lhere Artepe Aboriginal Corporation, the organisation which represents the Native Title Holders of Alice Springs, this is not acceptable behaviour, and giving handouts only encourages a begging culture when there is no need for it to exist.  Don't give money, cigarettes or food to those who ask.  There is a chance that you will get yelled at and cursed at for not giving a handout but ignore this and keep walking.  They will have forgotten you in 30 seconds anyway.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Alice Springs Points of Interest.png"],["thumb"],["right"],["Rough Map of Local Points of Interest"]]},"\n\nThere are four main roads leaving Alice Springs: the Stuart Highway, which runs north to Darwin and south to Port Augusta;  Larapinta Drive which runs West and splits off to the Namatjira road; and the Ross Highway, which runs East. The Stuart Highway (highway 87) is sealed all the way; this means it's got tarmac and is passable using a normal car. Larapinta Drive and Ross Highway are sealed for a couple hundred kilometers in each direction, but after that they convert to dirt roads which you will need a 4x4 vehicle to access.\n\nThere is a web of dirt trails  - sometimes called unsealed roads - which surrounds Alice Springs, and some of the nicest places within a few hours drive will require a four-wheel drive vehicle (4x4) to get to. There are two ways to go south. The first is the Stuart Highway, which is sealed and frequently traveled. The second is a dirt track which leads off the Stuart Highway; it's called the Old South Road. A dirt track connects the Old South Road to the modern Stuart Highway, from a point north of the aboriginal community of Titjikala.\n\nOn the side of the old South Road, you will see a narrow track that follows the road - this is the track of the Finke Desert Race which is held every year on the Queens Birthday Long Weekend in June.  Best to just view the track though and not drive on it as it is VERY tough going, even at low speeds.  If you are game and drive on it, have a think about how the competitors race along it at speeds in excess of 150 km\/h on race weekend.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Around Alice Springs"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chambers Pillar Historical Reserve"]]}," - a spectacular solitary column towering 40 metres above the Simpson Desert plain"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["East MacDonnell Ranges"]]}," - following Ross Highway, you'll find plenty of gaps, rocks and gorges"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ewaninga Conservation Reserve"]]}," - gain insight into an ancient culture as you explore the small, six hectare Ewaninga Rock Carvings"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Jim's Place"]}," - an outback roadhouse with Dinky, the singing dingo.
