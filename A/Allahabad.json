Hindu mythology has it that for the Prakrishta Yajna, Lord Brahma, the creator God of the Hindu Trinity, chose a land on earth, on which the three rivers would flow in to a quiet confluence. Brahma also referred to it as ",{"type":"''","value":["Tirth Raj"]}," or the ",{"type":"''","value":["King of all pilgrimage centres"]},". Recorded evidence also exists in the Hindu scriptures (the Vedas and the grand epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, as also in the Puranas) of this holy place formerly called ",{"type":"''","value":["Prayag"]},". Allahabad stands at the confluence of two of India's holiest rivers, the Ganges and the Yamuna. Sangam, as the confluence is called, is the venue of many sacred fairs and rituals, and attracts thousands of pilgrims throughout the year. This number swells to millions during the world-famous Kumbh Mela. An annual Magh Mela is also held in Allahabad around the Sangam areas in the month of January (Magh is the name of month in Hindu calendar).  A third mythical Saraswati river, believed to flow underground towards the Sangam, gives the confluence its other name, ",{"type":"''","value":["Triveni"]},".\n \nEmperor Akbar renamed this city in 1575 and called it by name of ",{"type":"''","value":["Illahabas"]},", which has now become modern Allahabad. The monarch realized its strategic importance as a waterway landmark in North India and also built a magnificent fort on the banks of the holy Sangam.\n\nOver the centuries that followed, Allahabad remained on the forefront of national importance, especially during the days of the Indian independence struggle. The chequered history of Allahabad with its religious, cultural and historical ethos also gave rise to several renowned scholars (M. N. Saha, Harishchandra, Ravindra Khattree, Amar Nath Jha), poets (Suryakant Tripathi Nirala, Mahadevi Verma, Harivansh Rai Bachchan, Sumitra Nandan Panth), writers (Mahadevi Verma, Ramkumar Verma, Jagdish Gupta), thinkers (Purusottam Das Tandon), statesmen and leaders (Motilal Nehru, Jawaharlala Nehru, Murli Manohar Joshi) and the actor Amitabh Bachchan.\n\nThe city, an important cantonment during the British Raj, has some beautiful remnants of colonial architecture. In the early 20th century, ",{"type":"'''","value":["University of Allahabad"]}," was the foremost center of learning in the country.  Allahabad today is an important city where history, culture and religion create a confluence, much like the sacred rivers that caress it.\n\nAllahabad used to have a thriving industrial suburb (Naini) till the 1980s, but then those public sector units started closing down one by one, forcing entire generations of young educated Allahabadis to migrate out of the city in search of work.  Today, Allahabad is slowly inching along in its dream to be an IT hub.  And the government administrative offices remain alive and kicking.\n\nIn Allahabad, you can enjoy \n",{"type":"*","value":[" The politeness of \"Aap\" and \"Hum\" (literally, \"us\" and \"we\" in Hindi, used as a form of respect instead of the singular)."]},{"type":"*","value":[" The subtle sense of humour of the person on the street"]},{"type":"*","value":[" The fun of walking and travelling on rickshaws"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe best way to reach Allahabad, if you are coming from outside India, is to take a direct flight to Delhi and then take one of the numerous connecting trains from Delhi to Allahabad.

Organized once in every twelve years, Kumbh 2001 was the largest ever human gathering in history. Vedas contain the laurels on the divine period of Kumbh, which make it the biggest festival for Hinduism.  Festivals of Makar Sankranti, Mauni Amavasya and Basant Panchami are the most auspicious days and 'Shahi Snaana' are held. The Kumbh area is a temporary settlement of tents made on the flood plains for Ganga and Yamuna which are vastly sprawled. It is better to book the camps\/hotels in advance as the number of visitors are unbelievably high. Plan the visit around 6 months before the starting of the fair. Deadly stampedes during Kumbh are unfortunately commonplace. \n\nKumbh is the largest gathering of human beings on the planet when it occurs. In 2001, 80-90 million pilgrims came for the divine Kumbh. Every year, a smaller version of Kumbh called Magh Mela is organized which falls during the Hindu month of Magha (Usually January or February). Magh Mela is an auspicious time to get married and Allahabad will be bustling with marriage processions long into the night during this period. Next Kumbh will fall in January 2013. Estimates predict 100 million people or more will make the pilgrimage in 2013.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Sangam "]},"\nA dip in the holy Sangam of the Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati is a must for the spiritually inclined. Sangam is a Sanskrit word for confluence. It is a sacred holy site for Hindus. According to Vedic literature and myths it is called Triveni Sangam because three rivers meet up here namely the holy Ganga, Yamuna and mythical Saraswati which is believed to be flowing beneath the surface. At the time of churning of sea (Samudra Manthan) by Gods (Suras) and the Demons (Asuras) few drops of amrita (holy nectar that makes a mortal immortal) fell at four different parts of the subcontinent during a fight between Gods and Demons over it. That places are Hardwar, Nasik, Prayag and Ujjain and are considered holy and MahaKumbha Mela is organised once in 12 years. Millions  of pilgrims, tourists, ascetics, sadhu\/sant (holy men) visit Prayag at the time of month long Kumbha for taking holy dip at sangam and perform religious rituals and ceremonies.
