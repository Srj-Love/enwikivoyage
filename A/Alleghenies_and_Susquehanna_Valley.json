Additionally, the Susquehanna Valley is home to a few pockets of Amish and Mennonite culture. The area is rich in revolutionary and industrial heritage and traces its roots as far back as the mid-1600s. The Susquehanna River is believed to be one of the oldest systems in the world and is the largest non-navigable river in the United States.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Counties"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Bedford County"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Blair County "]},{"type":"*","value":[" Cambria County"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Columbia County "]},{"type":"*","value":[" Fulton County"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Huntingdon County"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Juniata County"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Mifflin County"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Montour County"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Northumberland County"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Schuylkill County"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Snyder County"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Union County"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Altoona (Pennsylvania)"],["Altoona"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bedford (Pennsylvania)"],["Bedford"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Berwick (Pennsylvania)"],["Berwick"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bloomsburg"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Danville (Pennsylvania)"],["Danville"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hershey (Pennsylvania)"],["Hershey"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hanover (Pennsylvania)"],["Hanover"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Harrisburg"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Johnstown"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lewisburg (Pennsylvania)"],["Lewisburg"]]},"-",{"type":"[[","value":[["Selinsgrove"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lititz"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mercersburg"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Numidia"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shamokin Dam"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shrewsbury (Pennsylvania)"],["Shrewsbury"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Spring Grove (Pennsylvania)"],["Spring Grove"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["York (Pennsylvania)"],["York"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Williamsport"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nWhile much of the area is made up of farmland, sizable towns and small to midsized cities line the shores on each side of the Susquehanna.
