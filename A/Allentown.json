Active gangs in the city include 18th Street, Black Dragons, Bloods, Crips, Latin Kings, Los Solidos, Mexican Mafia, GGU Crew, and MS-13.  Thus, Graffiti is very widespread.\n\nIn 2006, Allentown had 16 murders, 42 rapes, and 6059 property crimes. The crime index was 6667.5 per 100,000 in 2006, while the national average was only 4479.3. Allentown has a crime rates almost twice the national average in every category, including rape, robbery, theft, auto theft, murder, assault, and burglary. Rougher areas include parts of East Allentown and some neighborhoods of Center City north of  Linden St. and south of Tilghman St. as well as the area between the American Parkway and Lehigh River, just east of Center City.  Random acts of violence and crime against visitors is rare - much of the crime in the area involves people involved in drugs, gangs, or other illicit activities.  It would be unwise to try to buy drugs or other contraband in the city.\n\nIt is fairly easy to stay safe by following common sense.  Theft is an issue, so be sure to lock cars and stay out of poorer areas at night. Prostitution and street racing are also issues in Allentown.  Don't walk alone late at night or on dimly lit streets.  The most likely victim of a mugging on an Allentown street is someone who is alone and intoxicated, so keep your wits about you.  If homeless approach you for change, just keep walking if you don't want to give anything. Pickpocketing is not a large problem, but don't flash around your money.\n\nThere is a large police presence in the neighborhoods most frequented by visitors, especially Hamilton Street.  Many officers in Center City use bicycles.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Hospitals"]},"\nIf you are in need of medical attention, here are some hospitals in the area:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.shh.org\/ Sacred Heart Hospital"]}]},", 421 Chew St, Allentown, 610-776-4500"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.lvh.org\/17thandchew Lehigh Valley Hospital - 17th Street"]}]},", 1627 W Chew St, Allentown, 610-402-CARE"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.lvh.org\/lvh\/Locations\/Cedar_Crest Lehigh Valley Hospital - Cedar Crest"]}]},", 1200 S Cedar Crest Blvd, Allentown, 610-402-CARE"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.mystlukesonline.org\/locations\/stl-allentown-campus\/index.aspx St. Luke's Hospital"]}]},", 1736 Hamilton St, Allentown, 610-628-8300"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Respect"]},"\nAs in many parts of the country, citizens may not want to share religious or political views.
