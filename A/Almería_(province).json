The area is known as one of high unemployment but with its hot climate, new wealth is arriving in the form of agriculture; fruit, vegetables and flowers.  Due to the climate much of the landscape is dry and desert-like, but lunar landscapes and fabulous rock formations are abundant and this amazing terrain made Almeria home to some of the greatest spaghetti westerns ever made.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nLos Millares, Europe's most important settlement from the Copper Age, near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Almeria"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Itineraries"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nFor ",{"type":"'''","value":["resort type beaches"]}," try ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Roquetas de Mar"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mojácar"]]}," north towards Murcia which has lovely sandy beaches, Med sea and in season is full of laid back beach bars and clubs.\n\nFor the ",{"type":"'''","value":["more unspoilt"]}," feel, try ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cabo de Gata-Níjar Natural Park"],["Cabo de Gata (Nijar)"]]},{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.unique-almeria.com\/european-beaches.html"]}," which is a national park containing a stretch of rocky\/ covey coastline with small villages.
