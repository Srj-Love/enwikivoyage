Alohans have an attitude that most just do not understand.  This is shown by the fact that the town is unincorporated, despite its size.  Alohans do not want to deal with any more government than necessary.  Schools are funded by the districts of neighboring cities ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beaverton"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hillsboro (Oregon)"],["Hillsboro"]]},".  Fire and police services are provided by the county.  Part of the mistrust of city governments comes from the neighboring communities.  Beaverton and Hillsboro have been at war for decades over who can annex the most land in the smallest amount of time.  Aloha, being sandwiched between the two, has become a prime target.  Since it is unincorporated, the residents of Aloha will not get to vote on annexation, although the State of Oregon currently has a protection in place against possible takeover.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nFly into ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.flypdx.com Portland International Airport (PDX)"]},".
