History lovers will especially enjoy the route.\n\nStores offering drinks and basic snacks can be found in any village along the route. Restaurants and guesthouses (",{"type":"''","value":["pansiyon"]},") are located in well-travelled villages of Troy, Geyikli, Dalyan, Tavaklıiskelesi, Gülpınar, Babakale, and Assos in reasonable numbers. Gas stations, while present, are less frequent, though, especially in the section between Tavaklıiskelesi and Assos, but starting with a full tank in Çanakkale will go a long way.\n\nIn the total, the route is about 125 km of driving.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Prepare"]},"\nWhile not an absolute necessity, having a detailed map of the area would be good, and will help especially in a number of junctions that very well lead to a maze of local roads between villages around Geyikli and Dalyan. However, carefully following the signposts is more than enough, and other than Geyikli and Dalyan area, the itinerary generally follows the ",{"type":"''","value":["only"]}," road in the region—you cannot get lost even if you want to.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Çanakkale"]]},", which has extensive bus and highway connections (though with a ferry when crossing the Dardanelles from Europe and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Istanbul"]]},") is the obvious entry point to the itinerary.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go\/Drive"]},"\nWhile the itinerary can be done by using public transport, some of the backcountry roads taken along the itinerary have 2-hour intervals of buses at best, so self driving should obviously be the preferred way to get around, although it is not strictly essential. Wherever there is a low bus service, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tips for hitchhiking"],["hitchhiking"]]}," also helps, it is not very hard to attract a lift in the region. Ardent hitchhikers are also known to do the whole route by nothing else but their thumbs. The route can also be reasonably done by a bicycle, especially by those experienced at cycling on hilly terrain. There are fountains with drinkable water between the villages along the route.\n\nStart early if you are to do the route in a day.\n\nAfter leaving ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Çanakkale"]]}," behind on the southwards highway to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Izmir"]]}," numbered D550\/E87, and passing through a pine-covered hilly section south of city, you'll arrive in the plains and the junction of the road leading to the legendary ancient city of ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Troy (Turkey)"],["Troy"]]}]},", which is one of the highlights of the itinerary. Touring around the ruins and climbing up the Trojan Horse can be done in as little as an hour, although history lovers will probably like to spend more time.\n\nWhen you are done in Troy, head back to the highway you came in, this time heading south. After a few km on the highway, take the westbound road, signposted to ",{"type":"''","value":["Geyikli-Bozcaada"]},". This will bring you back to the coast of Aegean Sea in the village of ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Geyikli"]]}]},". Those without a car at their disposal should take the buses to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ezine"]]}," on the highway and switch to westbound buses to Geyikli there, run by Ezine Birlik (",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name="],["url=http:\/\/www.ezinebirlik.com\/index.asp"],["email=info@ezinebirlik.com"],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+90 286 618 10 11"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]},"), which can get you as far as to Babakale further on the itinerary. From Geyikli, for a livelier experience, you may opt for taking the ferries across to ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Bozcaada"]]}]},", an attractive and lively island with some beautiful architecture and streetscapes. However, if you choose to cross there, it would be an injustice both to Bozcaada and to yourself to overlook the island and not to stay there at least a night.\n\nUpon returning to the mainland from Bozcaada (if you chose to get there), head south from Geyikli towards the village of ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Dalyan (Marmara)"],["Dalyan"]]}]},". On your way to Dalyan, visit the ruins of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Alexandria Troas"]},", founded by Alexander the Great on his way to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["India"]]},", which have some collapsed marble columns scattered around and an intact bathhouse.\n\nStill following the southbound route along the coast, you will get to the resort town of ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Tavaklıiskelesi"]]}]}," after Dalyan, which have some cafes and restaurants next to its long beach where you may have a lunch, unless you have already done that in Geyikli or Dalyan.\n\nAfter Tavaklıiskelesi, road strays away from the coast and starts to turn and twist through the hilly interior of the peninsula, which has the typical Mediterranean landscape of olive- and vineyards and ",{"type":"''","value":["maquis"]}," shrublands covering the hillsides. A place of note on this road may be the natural saltpan on the side of a hill just next to a creek. You will pass through a number of villages on this section, which preserved their stone Mediterranean-style architecture, thanks to the relative remoteness of the area.\n\nAbout 30 km further south on this backcountry road will take you to ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Gülpınar"]]}]},", a village on the top of a mountain with a distant view of Aegean Sea. This is where the impressive, but partially intact ",{"type":"'''","value":["Temple of Apollon"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["Apollon Smintheon"]},") is located.\n\nFrom Gülpınar, take the narrow and winding 8-km road to ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Babakale"]]}]},", the coastal village on the westernmost tip of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Asia"]]},"n mainland, marked by a castle. The road leading to Babakale traverses through a quite out-of-world landscape, with large dark boulders dressed with sparse shrubs, all perfectly contrasting to deep blue Aegean. After visiting the castle, you may have your afternoon tea in the coffeehouse just across the village square from the gate of castle.\n\nWhen you are done in Babakale, head back to Gülpınar and take the eastwards road to ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Assos"]]}]},", where you will get to after passing through a number of villages and some more Mediterranean landscapes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nSafety is not really an issue on this route, crime is practically nil and there are no especially dangerous animals in the area to speak of. As long as you are careful when driving in the winding and narrow sections of the road and are drinking enough water especially in the height of summer, you will be more than OK.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nMost of those travelling this route usually do so on their way to more southern towns and resorts along the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Aegean Turkey"],["Aegean"]]},", so you may do the same and take the eastbound road from Assos to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Küçükkuyu"]]}," which will bring you back to the highway D550\/E87, which leads to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Izmir"]]},".\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usableitinerary"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Troad"]]}]
