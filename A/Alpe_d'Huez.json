Extensive snowmaking facilities helped combat the ski area's largely south-facing orientation and helped Alpe d'Huez appeal to beginner skiers, with very easy slopes. The expansion of the skiing above the linked resorts of Vaujany, Oz-en-Oisans, Villard Reculas and Auris boosted the quantity and quality of intermediate grade slopes but the resort is mostly known for freeskiing, drawing many steep skiing enthusiasts to its high altitude terrain.\n\nAside from the Tunnel and Sarenne black runs, the latter the world's longest at 16 km, many ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Off-piste"]]}," opportunities exist both from the summit of the 3330 m Pic Blanc and the 2808 m Dome des Petites Rousses.
