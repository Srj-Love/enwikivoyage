The initial settlement of the locality began with the village of Old Alresford, mentioned in the Domesday Book. In the late 12th Century, a \"Great Weir\" was constructed to create Old Alresford Pond, and at this point a (comparatively) new settlement sprang up alongside: this second town is to this day known as \"New Alresford\", despite the fact that it is over 800 years old.  Locals refer to it as simply \"Alresford\", only adding the prefix in the case of Old Alresford, which remains a sleepy but picturesque little village.\n\nToday, in many ways Alresford is the quintessential ",{"type":"[[","value":[["England"],["English"]]}," small country town, with the friendly atmosphere and English traditions maintained throughout the ages.  This \"vibe\" is owed in part to the fact that it is sufficiently inconvenient for commuters to London that the demographic of the town is mostly families and retirees, many of whom have lived there for generations.  Young people who grow up in the town frequently move away for their career, then return to start a family.  As a result, there is a strong sense of community, and a warmth towards both visitors and locals.\n\nThe oldest and most picturesque part of the town is where Broad Street meets East Street and West Street.  These three streets are lined with beautiful Georgian townhouses and shops.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By road:"]}," Alresford is just off the A31, between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Winchester (England)"],["Winchester"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alton (Hampshire)"],["Alton"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By bus:"]}," The 64 (Winchester to Alton) runs though Alresford twice an hour and the 67 (Winchester to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Petersfield"]]},") runs through Alresford every two hours.\n\nTimetables are available on the Stagecoach Bus ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.stagecoachbus.com"]}," and Velvet Bus ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.velvetbus.co.uk\/"]}," websites.
