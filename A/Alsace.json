The local culture is distinct, and the region offers historic cities and castles, and interesting countryside. A popular itinerary is the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alsatian Vineyard Route"]]}," - fabulous for walking from town to town trying a whole bunch of local wines.\n\nAlsace also has some of the most beautiful cathedrals and churches in Western Europe. The stunning Strasbourg Cathedral is a unique example of a mix of roman and gothic architecture and has the peculiarity of having one tower only and of being built with pink Vosges gres.\n\nDue to their tumultuous past history, Alsatians are extremely proud to be French and take great offence in being mistaken for Germans when they go overseas or inland France. You will not see more French flags on the streets of any other inland French cities. Alsatians have a very deep attachment to France even if the French Government has not always reciprocated. During WWI, all Alsatians men were sent by the Germans to the Russian front. Some boys managed to escape before being sent there and went to Paris to enrol in the French army. This act of courage however came at a dire price as the family of those \"malgré nous\" would often be killed or sent to concentration camps.\n\nThe Bas-Rhin is the northern departement of Alsace; Haut-Rhin refers to the departement south of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Selestat"]]},".\n\nAlsace is divided East by the Rhine river (also forming the natural border between France and Germany) and West by the Vosges mountain range.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nFrench is the official language and spoken by everyone, young and old. German dialect is still widely spoken by the older generation and in the more rural areas. The English language can be still limited to the younger generation. In some areas, the population may still use the native German dialect of ",{"type":"''","value":["Alsacien"]},", an Allemanic German dialect similar to that spoken across the German border in western ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Baden-Württemberg"]]}," or in northwestern Switzerland, but you will always find someone who can speak French fluently. Knowledge of standard German has again become important for economic reasons, but certainly English is more likely to play this role.\n\nThe Alsacien dialect was widely spoken in the big cities before WWII. After the war, people were discouraged from speaking anything else but French and children were even punished if heard speaking Alsacien on the playground.\n\nIn the last 30 years, the Alsacien dialect has rapidly declined and therefore the French Government has put in place some measures to try and save it. Children at school can take in optional \"Regional Language and Culture\" lessons and can even choose this subject as an optional one in their final high school examination.\nTo an unexercised ear, Alsacien might sound very similar to standard German, when it is in fact very different. As there is no written grammar, Alsacien is pretty much a free agent and whenever new words come into the everyday vocabulary, people will normally choose the French word over the German ones. Today, Alsacien is enjoying a small resurgence with many communities,(including Strasbourg),posting bi-lingual street signs in both standard French and Alsacien dialect as the stigma associated with German culture is no longer an issue.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nThe Haut-Rhin ",{"type":"''","value":["département"]}," is served by Euroairport, the airport that serves ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mulhouse"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Basel"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Freiburg"]]},", with excellent links by road and train to these cities.
