The stocks of German tourists in the area also contribute to the fact that you can get along everywhere with German. French is the only official language and is spoken by everyone, apart from elderly people who still prefer to avoid it. English is usually only basically understood.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nSince the Alsatian Vineyard Route is a rural area, accessibility with public transport is highly limited. If you drive a car you will find the signs very helpful guiding you to the next stop along the route.

The driver can easily take you to visit several of the medieval towns near Colmar allowing as much time as you wish to stroll each of them. (Most towns are very small and can be easily seen within 60-90 minutes.)

Some observations from a 2007 visit: The driver may speak only phrase-book English. If you understand French, the driver might offer some background on the sites, but is not required to do so. Have a list of towns you wish to see; suggestions are: ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Riquewihr"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ribeauvillé"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kaysersberg"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Eguisheim"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Turckheim"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bergheim"]]},". Let the driver choose the most efficient route. The number of towns you see depends on how much time you purchase and how long you linger in each town. It may be cheaper to purchase a block of time such a half or full day. The tourist office at Colmar might be able to help book a tourist taxi.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nYou can get around on foot within any town you visit.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nAll wine villages along the route are medieval and were almost perfectly preserved.

Unusually for France, the wine labels prominently feature the grape variety. Riesling ages well and takes on a minerally, almost petrol flavor over time. Gewurztraminer is a wine you will love or hate. Floral, spicy, and perfumed, it is an ideal wine for spicy food such as curries. Pinot Gris is the French name for the now unbiquitous Pinot Grigio of Italy. Pinot Noir is the only red wine widely produced in Alsace.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Respect"]},"\n\nSome of the locals might be offended if you refer to their small, medieval town as a \"village\" (",{"type":"''","value":["village"]}," in French).
