Straddling the western edge of the Gobi Desert where the Altai Mountains rise out of the sands, the region seems to symbolize emptiness. To the south of the city is the massive Great Gobi Strictly Protected Area 'A' and 'B'. Area A lies to the east with part of the park in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bayanhongor"]]},", and Area B is smaller and to the west. Together they cover some of the driest and more remote parts of the Gobi. Many high snow-capped mountains are closer to the city in the Altai range just to the south and west.\n\nGovĭ-Altai is home to many rare mammals like the Govi Bear, wild Bactrian camels, Argali sheep, black-tailed gazelles, and wild cats. Many other large mammals like wolves, foxes, marmots, and birds and reptiles live in different parts of the province.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh =  -10.4"],["febhigh =  -8.9"],["marhigh =  -2.5"],["aprhigh =   5.9"],["mayhigh =  13.6"],["junhigh =  18.7"],["julhigh =  19.7"],["aughigh =  18.3"],["sephigh =  12.8"],["octhigh =  5.0"],["novhigh =  -3.5"],["dechigh =  -8.3"],["janlow =  -24.8"],["feblow =  -23.3"],["marlow =  -16.0"],["aprlow =  -6.8"],["maylow =  0.6"],["junlow =  5.9"],["jullow =  8.0"],["auglow =  6.5"],["seplow =  0.5"],["octlow =  -7.1"],["novlow =   -17.0"],["declow =   -23.3"],["janprecip =  1.0"],["febprecip =  1.8"],["marprecip =  5.9"],["aprprecip =  10.1"],["mayprecip =  12.2"],["junprecip =  27.7"],["julprecip =  48.6"],["augprecip =  40.7"],["sepprecip =  16.0"],["octprecip =  7.5"],["novprecip =  2.9"],["decprecip =  1.5"],["description = NOAA (1961-1990)"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nBuses and microbuses leave for Altai from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ulaanbaatar"]]}," from the Dragon Center everyday at 12pm.
