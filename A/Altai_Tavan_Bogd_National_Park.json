The oldest images in the park are from 11,000 to 6,000 BC with hunting large mammals and ancient cultures. Thousands of years of petroglyphs show the transition from hunter-gatherer to pastoralism and later to the current semi-nomadic that developed over the last 3,000 to 4,000 years. Around 4,000 years ago, the use of horses and domestication of animals led to the rise of the Blue Turks (whose language is the root of Kazakh and Turkish). These successful warriors left upright carved stone statues known as Turkic Stone Men spread over the Altai Mountains.\n\nLater in 700 BC, a group of horse-riding warrior nomads known as the Scythians starting from the Altai Mountains to conquer a region stretching to the Black Sea. They faded after being defeated by Alexander the Great in modern day Turkmenistan in 329BC, but not before leaving many stone burial mounds in the Altai. These mounds, or Khirigsuur, were designed to preserve bodies in frozen ground with horses, weapons, armor, and food for the afterlife. On such mound was discovered to contain a Scythian warrior in full battle regalia in a 2005 research expedition. In 100 AD, the Huns migrated through the region from the steppes of Mongolia to wreak havoc on Europe around 400 AD. Around this same time, Reindeer herding tribes from Siberia, called Tuvans, began expanding south into the mountains.\n\nThe mountains and much of the surrounding region including the early Silk Road to the south fell under control of Turkic-Uighur Khannate (kingdom) after 600 AD until Genghis Khan conquered it along with most of Asia from 1260. The Uighurs and Turks were incorporated into the army of the Khan. After Genghis death, the empire was divided between his sons, with the Altai forming the border between the Golden Horde (Russia), Chagatai Khan (Central Asia), and Yuan Dynasty (China). The region changed hands several times due to infighting and dividing territories the Mongol Empire declined. The region fell under control of the Yuan Dynasty until they declined in 1370. The region was then ruled by independent Oirat Mongol tribes until conquered by the Qing Dynasty in 18th Century.\n\nBetween 1840s and 1940s, many Kazakhs moved into the Altai mountains to escape persecution and domination by Russians and later Soviets and Chinese Communists. Mongolia became a satellite state of the USSR after a long bloody civil war from 1911 to 1924. For the next 70 years, Tavan Bogd was an isolated border zone closed to all but a few ignored Kazakh herders and army patrols.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Pontuninii Glacier.JPG"],["thumb"],["Pontuninii Glacier"]]},{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Horgan Lake.jpg"],["thumb"],["Horgan Lake in Tavan Bogd National Park"]]},"\nAltai Tavan Bogd has some of the most stunning scenery in all of Mongolia with towering white mountains, glaciers, deep lush valleys, and large lakes.

Other common flowers are the Edelweiss, a white star-shaped flower, and the Geranium, a mountain flower found in many different colors. There are 974 plant species, of which 60 are found no where else, in the Altai Mountain range. These include 26 species of orchids and 35 ferns. The region is noted for its especially diverse range of colors of lichen and moss. Rare species of plants include Isoetus lacustris, Brunnera siberica, Erythronium sibiricum, and 2 species of monkshood. Flowers are best in the mountains while forests grow on the northern faces of mountains (due to most moisture being from Siberia). River valleys are green during summer.\n\nThe fauna of the park is noted for its many large animals, including the largest wild sheep, fastest falcon, and largest eagle in the wild. The number of large mammals has made it popular with hunters for millennia with gray wolves, brown bears, Beech marten, marmots, red deer, and the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Corsac fox"]}," still being common today.

Though other places in Central Asia, Kazakhs or Kyrgyz have trained eagles for hunting, most are not capable of actually catching live prey. The Kazakh eagle hunters in Mongolia are an except thanks to luck of history. Being part of Mongolia instead China or Soviet Union meant the region was less developed and traditional culture was not suppressed. Today multiple film crews and journalists travel to this remote region each winter to witness a live hunt. A few adventurous, warm-blooded tourists experience a successful hunt each year also, that only takes place during the winter months when it is easy to spot fox tracks and its fur is thick and soft. There are 250 eagle hunters in Bayan-Ãlgii (the vast majority of the world's eagle hunters), with most living in or near Altai Tavan Bogd National Park."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Skiing"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/bluewolftravel.com\/altai-tavan-bogd-skying"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Usually in April and May when fresh deep snow falls on Tavan Bogd Mountains"],["price=Included in tour packages"],["content=This is organized by Blue Wolf Travel.

You can get topo maps and travel maps at the State Department Store in Ulaanbaatar. The bookstore on the 6th floor has maps of various regions and parks in Mongolia. You will not be able to buy one in Ãlgii, but you could make a copy or print one off the internet. Several of the tour guides have good maps that they use.\n\nThere is only one small seasonal shop in Syrgal, a small clump of houses near the Rangers Station and bridge between Khoton and Khurgan Nuur (Lake). Don't expect to get supplies here. You may have to bang on the door to get them to open as customers are irregular. It is best to stock up on food and other necessities in Ãlgii. There are several supermarkets and a bazaar in the city that carry a wide variety of food, fruits, vegetables, beverages, and Chinese goods. If driving to the park yourself, there is 80 grade gasoline available in the soum centers (villages). Prices will be slightly higher than gas prices in Ãlgii.\n\nMost prices are in Mongolian Togrogs (1560 = $1), though tour guides and tourist activities will be priced in dollars.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nThere are no restaurants in the park. Take any food you need with you. Local Kazakh foods are generally meat and...more meat, especially in the countryside. Goat, sheep, horse, camel and cow. Most food will be meat, flour, maybe potatoes, and a large amount of cooking oil.\n\nYou will most likely \"go native\" and eat with the locals. It's customary, and generally a nice thing, to bring some onions, potatoes, carrots, cabbage, a bag of noodles, or rice, as food items you can give to the woman of the house, who mainly prepares all meals. This is easy if you've hired a car and driver for your trip. You can get these items in any quantity at the open air Bazaar in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ãlgii"]]},". A really interesting place to go. Your driver or guide can help here. You'll also want to take along bottles of water for the ride. Also bring any herbs, tomato sauce, or soy sauce to help make the food tastier to your personal preference.\n\nIf you are really staying with locals in the park, it's also nice to give a needed household item as a token of your appreciation. Candles, packets of matches, a small block of green tea, and of course candy or chocolates for the table and kids. It's not mandatory of course, but a nice gesture.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nAgain, no restaurants in the park. Bring bottled or boiled water with you and the means to purify or boil water when camping and traveling. Lots of water around, just take the usual precautions. When with the locals, there's always the usual favorites, milk tea and koumis (a fizzy, sour fermented horse milk).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nThere is no permanent year-round lodging inside the park. Some gers (felt tents) are set up inside the park during the summer for tourists to stay. Even the residents of the park leave during the winter to go to their winter pastures.\n",{"type":"===","value":["Lodging"]},"\nMost of the tour companies who travel in the park will bring you to their own pre-arranged accommodation, either their own lodge or camp set up. There are a few very scattered ger (yurt) camps around, but you'll have to check with the park office for their current locations.\n\nInside the park, there are no commercial lodges, hotels, backpackers, etc. There are small hotels in the nearby villages of Tsengel and Altai. Though, these are a considerable distance from much of the park. Independent travelers can find lodging with local Kazakh herders if they want to get a very enjoyable and interesting local experience. If you do this, pay them for your stay. Income opportunities for these people are very limited. Four to eight dollars a night is currently acceptable and good value for the experience. When traveling further into the mountains, there is no lodging.\n\nThere are now several herder communities who have gotten together and can provide some primitive services such as accommodation and guiding. Check with the park information office to find where these are if you want to visit a real community based tourist venture. It can be a great experience, but be prepared for basic, very basic. The local tour companies can book lodging with local herders for you. They have agreements on the rates and take a 10% fee for booking (as required by Mongolian law).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Camping"]},"\nIf traveling with a tour company they will (or should) have everything you need for a comfortable camping experience. Take pains to make sure they are reputable and do have what you need. Ask the park information office about good camping areas in the park.\n\nThere are very few designated camping sites around the park, so it's basically up to you where you want to put your bones for the night. If around a herder family, it's a common courtesy to ask if you can camp close to their ger (yurt). Most will enjoy having you there, and you will be secure for the night.\n\nThe same rules for camping apply here as anywhere else in the world. If you pack it in, pack it out! This is especially important in and around the base camp area for the Tavan Bogd (five kings) range, where serious high alpine climbing can be had. It is a very fragile area and easily impacted by human use.\n\nAS for camping toilet needs. There are no toilets. If you don't know how to \"shit in the woods\", you'll want to practice a bit before undertaking a Mongolian adventure. Also, there most likely won't be any woods. Don't worry; Mongolians aren't prudes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nWhen traveling in the park, especially if you're an individual or an independent group, it's best to register with the park office and let them know your intentions. There is no \"rescue\" service of any kind in Mongolia, but at least they'll know where to begin looking for you if you do go missing or get hurt. Locals are very kind and helpful, but if you do get seriously injured, it will basically be up to your own initiative and strength to get you out of there. Good seasonal clothing, first aid kit, backcountry equipment for the activity you're planning, a good map, and a little knowledge of the area are essential.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Wildlife"]},"\nThere are wolves, bears, foxes, and other potentially dangerous animals inside the park. Locals will warn you to watch out wolves especially when traveling alone. However, attacks on people are very rare, and wolves are afraid of humans. You stand a much better chance of being bitten by a dog near one of the encampments. Another concern is diseases carried by animals. Locals eat marmots, though this can be dangerous, as they carry bubonic plague. To ask if you are being served marmot in Kazakh say \"soor bar ma?\".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Border"]},"\nThere is no fence or markers for the border with Russia. The Chinese have placed concrete pillars on the border with Chinese flags on it. If you see one on a mountain peak, turn around. It is possible to get lost and wander into Russia if you are not with an experienced local guide. There have been 2 such cases in recent years of a tourist and a separate guide getting picked up by the Russian Army. They were turned over to the Mongolian Army and driven back to Ãlgii at your own expense. A good map or GPS is essential if traveling without a guide.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Crime"]},"\nWhen traveling alone anywhere, it's always a good thing to play it safe. There is potential to run into a few rogues along your route. It is a wild place and far from anywhere. That's what's appealing. Hopefully as a traveler you already have the experience to read situations as they arise when coming across certain individuals. When camping for the night, it's a good idea to ask a local herder to camp near their ger (yurt) for extra safety. If that's not possible, be discreet in choosing where to set up the tent. Though crime is very rare inside the park, most issues that do occur involve drunk men. Be careful when vodka is present.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Food and Health Issues"]},"\nBe careful when drinking water or eating uncooked food from locals. Livestock are kept near rivers during the summer and water pollution from animals is an issue. Kazakhs adhere to Muslim customs of washing hands, though this can be more ceremonial than effective at times. Health issues can arise from falls, altitude, or cold weather. The entrance of the park is 6 to 8 hours away from the nearest hospital and another 4 hour flight to the nearest trauma center in Ulaanbaatar. There is no cell phone coverage in the park, so be careful and don't do anything too stupid. If you do need help, go to one of the 3 ranger stations or 3 border patrol bases (located at the north end of Hoton Nuur Lake, across the river from Syrgil, and on the south shore of the southernmost of the 3 lakes, Dayan Lake).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nAltai Tavan Bogd is about as far away from the rest of the world as you can get.
