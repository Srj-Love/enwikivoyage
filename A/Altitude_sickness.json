Your body will respond in various ways to this: some are normal, some are illnesses. The illnesses are a serious health hazard and can result in death if ignored or left untreated.\n\nAltitude sickness is very dangerous for four reasons: it can come on suddenly and progress quickly, it can be fatal, sufferers are often some distance from medical help and are difficult to evacuate swiftly, and in many cases sufferers are reliant on their health because they're doing a lot of physical activity in dangerous environments.\n\nThere are other risks at altitude, not covered here. One is that it may get very cold; see ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cold weather"]]},". Another is that there may be danger from strong sun because there is less atmosphere above to protect you; see ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sunburn and sun protection"]]},".

This is critically important for avoiding problems.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["How high is high?"]},"\nA minority of people, about 20%, have some symptoms of altitude sickness if they ascend to about 2500m (8000 feet) above sea level and sleep there. (This is the level of cabin pressurisation of most commercial aircraft apart from the Airbus A380 and Boeing 787). However, most people will acclimatize to 3000m (10,000 feet) with relative ease, perhaps having symptoms after the first night.\n\nAcclimatizing to heights of 3000–5000m (10,000–16,000 feet) is much more difficult, and it is here that it is absolutely necessary to ascend slowly and return to a lower altitude to sleep if you have been travelling around at a higher altitude during the day. Over 50% of people will become ill if they ascend rapidly from sea level to 3500m (11,000 feet) without acclimatization, and everyone will if they ascend rapidly to 5000m (16,000 feet).\n\nIt is thought to be impossible to permanently acclimatize to heights above 5500m (18,000 feet). It is possible to spend several weeks sleeping as high as 6000m (20,000 feet) once acclimatized, but gradual deterioration of physical well-being will still occur.\n\nRegions above 8000m (26,000 feet) are referred to as ",{"type":"'''","value":["the death zone"]},": you will deteriorate noticeably while you remain at such high altitudes, some of your body's major systems will shut down and climbers will only remain there for two or three days. Death rates from altitude sickness above 7000m (23,000 feet) are estimated at 4% of all people who venture that high.\n\nIf your home is significantly above sea level, you gain a definite leg up on ascending to higher elevations, but that doesn't make you immune to altitude problems; it just pushes the threshold for their onset higher.  Most otherwise healthy people who live at elevations of 1500m (5000 feet) to 2500m (8000 feet), an elevation range containing quite a few major cities, experience little trouble going to 3000m (10,000 feet) or a bit higher, but even they will be at risk of altitude problems at 5000m (16,000 feet).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Risk factors"]},"\nAltitude sickness tends to affect men more than women, especially men between the ages of 16 and 25. It's not clear if there's some unknown biological reason for this, or if it's just the demographic most likely to attempt too much, too soon. It is important to remember that just because you are young and healthy, and haven't experienced altitude sickness in the past doesn't mean you are immune to it on future climbs.  Physical fitness is not necessarily a good indicator, and neither are strength or good health. You may react badly to altitude despite being fit, young and healthy. In fact, the fit, young and healthy have a hidden risk: their general physical capacity leads them to believe that they should handle altitude just fine, which is not always true.\n\nBad health, on the other hand, is a risk factor: particularly cardiac or respiratory problems. Healthy hearts and lungs have a hard enough time getting oxygen to your tissues at high altitudes. Naturally, if you have physical problems that make exertion difficult for you, you have reason to think carefully about exertion at high altitude, where it is much harder!\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Scuba diving"]}," increases risk of decompression sickness.

The loss of appetite, a precursor to nausea, can lead you in to a dehydration headache. Unfortunately, it is easy to mistake dehydration headaches for acute mountain sickness (AMS) headaches (below) and vice versa. If a headache does not improve after drinking a litre of fluids it should be considered as an AMS effect.\n \nDehydration headache can also be recognised by comparing pulse rates:  if your pulse rate goes up more than 20% when standing up after lying down for five minutes, you need more fluids.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Acute mountain sickness"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Acute mountain sickness"]}," (AMS) is the most common unhealthy response to altitude: it's a collection of signs that your body is becoming ill and has not adapted successfully to a higher altitude.\n\nFor your own safety, ",{"type":"'''","value":["assume any illness at altitude is AMS"]},". The most common reasons that people fail to descend as soon as they should are bad assumptions. They assume that having AMS is a sign of weakness; that their level of fitness means they can't have AMS; or mistake their symptoms for the flu or another illness. Assume AMS first: it happens to healthy strong people, and if it turns out you are indeed sick with something else, descending to a lower altitude will make it easier for your body to heal anyway.\n\nIn particular, if you've recently ascended, and you have a ",{"type":"'''","value":["headache"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["any other symptom"]},", you have AMS.

Very sick people can become confused and not realise how ill they are. Loss of appetite is a particularly good sign: anyone who has been walking or climbing at altitude for a day should be hungry for a good meal in the evening.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["If you have symptoms of AMS, do not ascend further"]},".

It sometimes occurs in conjunction with AMS or HACE, but sometimes on its own — it's thought to have different causes. When you have HAPE, your lungs fill with fluid. Signs include extreme fatigue; breathlessness (when not due to interrupted breathing — give yourself 30 seconds to recover upon waking); a cough, especially if it is wet and has blood in it; rattling or gurgling breath; chest congestion; very fast heart rate; very fast breathing; and blue extremities. A fever is sometimes present. It most commonly sets in at night.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["HAPE is another extremely serious illness"]},", and like HACE should be treated as a critical emergency.

The pattern begins with a few shallow breaths and increases to deep sighing respirations then falls off rapidly. Respirations may cease entirely for a few seconds and then the shallow breaths begin again. During the period when breathing stops the person often becomes restless and may wake with a sudden feeling of suffocation. This can disturb sleeping patterns, exhausting the climber. \n\nAcetazolamide is helpful in relieving the periodic breathing. This type of breathing is not considered abnormal at high altitudes.
