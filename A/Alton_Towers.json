Nemesis and Oblivion (you get the picture) are white knuckle rides to match anything in Europe and most rides in the USA. The park is very well themed and is built in a number of zones, namely Tower Street, Mutiny Bay, Katanga Canyon, Gloomy Wood, X-Sector, Forbidden Valley, Ug Land, Cloud Cuckoo Land, Adventure Land and Storybook Land. The ruins of this stately home are even used in a couple of ghostly rides.  Alton Towers is well signposted from the major motorways and is easily accessible from the major cities in England. Those visitors who wish to overnight can stay at one of the park's two hotels - The Alton Towers Hotel and the newer Splash Landings Hotel, which is also associated with a spectacular water park.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nAlton Towers is accessible both the M6 and M1 motorways. As it is a major tourist attraction it is very well signposted. Be prepared to drive the last few miles on narrow country lanes.\n\nIt is not advisable to travel to Alton Towers by public transport as the links are infrequent, but good options exist seasonally from Stoke on Trent, Uttoxeter and Derby.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nYou will need to be at either:\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Tussauds bus (YN08 NXL) 2008 Volvo B7RLE Plaxton Centro, Alton Tower shuttle livery, Derby, 1 October 2011 cropped.jpg"],["thumbnail"],["The Alton Towers shuttle bus"]]},"\nDerby or Nottingham train stations, then catch the X52 bus to the Towers from the station or bus station respectively. There is only one bus per day so make sure you don't miss it!\nStoke-on-Trent train station, then catch the 30 bus to the Towers.\nUttoxetter train station, then catch the 32A bus to the Towers. This bus has an average frequency of about once every two hours and is a local service, servicing all the little villages around Alton Towers. These buses have gained a reputation with the locals as being a bad service and there is little need to use them as getting to Uttoxetter requires changing or passing through at either Derby or Stoke.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees"]},"\nFor up to date details on prices visit the parks own website.\n\nPrices for the 2013 season will be:\nAdult £45*\nChild £36*\n\nNote: these are on \"on-the-day\" prices.  Buying your tickets in advance online can save you around £11 per adult and £7 per child\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe best way to get around the park is on foot. You can get a free park map from staff at the entrances or at various information points scattered throughout the park. The park is quite large and is very hilly so be prepared to walk long distances between rides.\n\nThere is also a monorail between the hotels and car-park and the park entrance. This is quicker than the 10 minute walk between the two but can have large queues during peak times.\n\nAlso you can use the cable car (skyride) to get between the park entrance and the pirate themed area known as Mutiny Bay, Forbidden Valley which is an alien themed area and fountain square, for the towers, Cloud Cuckoo Land (one of the two children's areas of the park) and the Dark Forest. It is advisable to use the skyride when traversing the valley between Forbidden Valley and Fountain Square as it is a very long and steep route through the parks gardens.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Facilities"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["Baby Change Facilities"]},"There are 7 baby changing facilities located within the toilets around the theme park.
