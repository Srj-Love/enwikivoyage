The town is famous its festivals, large river banks and temples. Many of Kochinites (people of Kochi, as popularly known), do prefer to live in Aluva, while working in Ernakulam City, considering quiet cityscape, waterfront facility and presence of large commercial areas.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nAluva, is well known for its large river banks of Periyar River. The town is divided into two halves by the river, making the commercial town towards southern side of river and residential areas towards northern side. The Shiva Temple, located in river banks is the main attraction of the town, due to the traditions and legends associated with it. The temple gets submerged under river, during moonsoon season (Mayâ€“September).\n\nAluva has a major historical significance. The town ceded to Travancore Kingdom by Kochi Kingdom as part of Travancore-Kochi Treaty of 1790. Due to which, the town became a first major defence line for Travancore-Kochi Kingdoms from any external aggressions. The Northern side of Aluva (Travancore Aluva), thus became famous for its extensive Nedumkotta lines (Frontlines Fortifications) of Travancore Army, whereas Southern Aluva (Cochin Aluva) turned into commercial port which received boats and ferry from Travancore's High ranges loaded with spices and other commodities of high value.\n\nThe formation of Modern Aluva started, when H.H Maharaja Chitra Thirunal, then-the Maharaja of Travancore started his industrialization program in 1930s, making Travancore Aluva, one of the major centers for various industries. More than a dozen heavy industries were opened, creating the largest industrial belt in Kerala. A large bridge across Periyar made easy connectivity between Cochin and Travancore sides of Aluva, which helped the town to grow and diversify its economy into non-agrarian areas.\n\nAfter independence, both sides of town merged into a single municipality and merged into Ernakulam district. Again, Aluva got a shot in the arm, when Kerala's largest private bank - The Federal Bank made the town as its Headquarters. Several small and medium sector financial institutions soon started its operations from this town, boosting its local economy. In 1990, Aluva was included into Greater Kochi Area, making it part of Kochi City and satellite town of Ernakulam.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nAluva is well connected by air, road and rail from all parts of the country\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Air"]},"\n\nCochin International Airport, is just 15 km from the town center and thus Aluva is the most nearest town from Airport.

However for past few years, the volume of the river got reduced drastically, thus one can see the idol throughout the year, except during monsoon season (May-Sept), when volume in the river increases multi-fold. There is no formal temple structure, rather a make-shift structure made out of weaved palm leaves and bamboo sticks. The most celebrated event is the annual Shivarathri festival, when thousands all over Kerala and other parts of India rush to the temple. This season is famous for post funeral rites of Hindu known as Shraddhham or Tarpanam, done in banks of the river."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Marthanada Varma Bridge"],["alt=Aluva Palam"],["url="],["email="],["address=NH 47"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content= The Marthanada Varma Bridge is considered as icon of the town.
