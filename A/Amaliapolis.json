[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Amaliapolis"]}," is a beautiful seaside village about 60km south of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Volos"]]},", on the western side of the Pagasetic Gulf in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Greece"]]},". It sits in its own bay with a small island off-shore and has a gently sloping sandy beach (good for kids) and several tavernas and bars, some of which stay open all year. The tavernas are particularly well-known for the fresh fish they serve and have many customers at week-ends with day-trippers from Volos.  It is also popular as a holiday destination in August for Athenians.  However outside August it is a great spot to get 'away from it all' and there are hardly any foreign tourists. Prices are also very reasonable as the Greek visitors won't put up with over-charging! Another bonus of the lack of foreign visitors is that the old.\nGreek concept of 'filoxenia' is alive and well and the locals are really friendly and welcoming. There is a choice of small hotels and apartments to rent which any web search can turn up. There are other nice beaches within easy reach of Amaliapolis - for example, Nies and near Pigadi.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Amaliapolis apartments"],["url=http:\/\/www.amaliapolis.com"],["email="],["address=Amaliapolis"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=Villa divided into 4 self-catering apartments each for 4 people on edge of seaside village within walking distance of sandy beach and village centre."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Amaliapolis"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Thessaly"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Geo"],["39.167452"],["22.888103"]]}]
