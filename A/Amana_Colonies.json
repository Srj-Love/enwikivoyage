These settlers, whose spirituality was marked by a strong belief in mysticism and communal life, sought to practice their religion in isolation. The Great Depression made it impossible for the villages to continue their isolation, and the Amana people voted to end their communal life and build economic ties with the outside world. To this day, residents still maintain some of the traditional industries:  woolen textiles, meats and cheeses, furnitureâ€”that their ancestors brought over from Germany.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe nearest airport with scheduled passenger service is the Eastern Iowa Airport, which is located between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cedar Rapids"]]}," and the Amana Colonies.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Mapframe"],["41.79"],["-91.91"],["zoom=13"],["height=400"],["width=800"]]},"\nThere is no public mass transit service, no bike rental, and no car rental service within the colonies.  Transportation is by car, by joining a bus tour, by biking, or by walking.\n\nEach of the villages is a couple of miles away from the next, originally making it about an hour's walk from one to the next.  However, few people routinely walk or bike between villages now, except to follow the bike trail between Middle Amana and Main Amana.  Within each small village, however, walking from one shop to the next is often the best choice.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Amana"],["alt=Main Amana"],["lat=41.80104"],["long=-91.868028"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Middle Amana"],["lat=41.7955618"],["long=-91.8996227"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Homestead"],["lat=41.7610864"],["long=-91.8730286"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=South Amana"],["lat=41.776117"],["long=-91.9674013"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=High Amana"],["lat=41.8033387"],["long=-91.9382346"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=West Amana"],["lat=41.8080604"],["long=-91.9637905"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=East Amana"],["lat=41.8091732"],["long=-91.851011"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Amana Colonies Recreational Trail"],["alt=Kolonieweg"],["url=http:\/\/amanacoloniestrails.org\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Trail for bicycling and walking, mostly paved, with some gravel.
