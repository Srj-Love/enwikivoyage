It was named after \"almond\" (in local dialect \"mannola\"), which indicates both the fruit and the tree. The tree was admired locally and it seems it was also a symbol of the dominating hill top location overlooking the beautiful scenery of the Sibillini Mountains to the west. In 568-570 Amandola was invaded by the Goths, then by the Lombards. In 700 it was attached to the Duchy of Spoleto, and subsequently divided into the districts of Camerino and Fermo. The repeated interventions of the Franks and the donation of much land to the Church by King Pepin led to the division of the Duchy of Spoleto. In 1249, from the union of the feuds Agello, Castel Leone and Marrubbione, the Comune of Amandola was formed and enclosed within a wall of 2,230 meters with 5 gates : Agello , San Giacomo (the only one still existing) , Marrubbione , Sant' Antonio and Putei . There were three public squares: the Platea Animalium, used for livestock fairs, the Platea Magna, used for meetings and popular festivals, the Platea Vallelonga, a market square. Statutes were made in 1265 and during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance period it had a flourishing weaving industry. At the end of the sixteenth century, important agreements were drawn-up between Amandola and the surrounding communities for defining the boundaries. One of its most important lords was the leader Mostarda da Forlì (XIV - XV century). In 1798 Amandola suffered the impact of the Napoleonic forces and because of a resistance attempt, it was ransacked and the tomb of Saint Beato Antonio was desecrated. The French occupation ended only in 1800 and the papal government was re-established.\n\nDuring World War II Angelo Biondi was shot in the main square. In March 1944 the German troops engaged in a brief battle with the partisans which ended with the execution of 10 men. Still in the Nazi-Fascist period, in September 1943, two families of Yugoslavs Jewish refugees came to Amandola (eight in all) fleeing to the South. Despite the danger, the whole town, led by the stationmaster Giuseppe Brutti, tried to help them. The inhabitants formed a commission in order to give free accommodation, food and blankets and anything else they needed to the refugees, who had nothing. When a spy revealed the presence of Jews in the town, they were moved to the hamlet of San Cristoforo, where they remained until the Liberation. For their action, Giuseppe Brutti and his wife Elvira Lucci Brutti have been granted the title of ' Righteous among the Nations\" by the Yad Vashem Institute in Jerusalem. Over the postwar years Amandola experienced a significantly increased population, which reached over 6,000 people, as well as commercial development. Over the following decades there was a decline in the population growth and in 2012 the town had only about 3,700 inhabitants.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Geography"]},"\nAmandola is located at 550m above sea level within the National Park of the Sibillini Mountains, and it used to be called the East gate of the Park. Surrounded by the mountain range, it stands as a leader of the other neighboring municipalities: Sarnano (in the province of Macerata) , Comunanza (in the province of Ascoli Piceno) and Montefortino (in the province of Fermo). It is surrounded by countless hamlets, once entirely inhabited and each one provided with a school, but today they are mostly uninhabited or visited by tourists in the summer or winter.\n\nThe Sibillini Mountains are a mountain range that form part of the Apennines in central Italy. Many of the peaks are over 2,000 meters and the highest is Mount Vettore at 2,476 meters. They provide stunning natural scenery. Some rivers, such as Tenna, Aso, Nera and Ambro, start from these beautiful mountains and flow to the Adriatic coast, running through lovely valleys. In the park there are also two lakes: Lake Fiastra which is man-made and Lake Pilate an amazing natural lake at 1,940m above sea level.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\nThere are 1,800 flower species.
