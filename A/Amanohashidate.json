Purchase tickets at the bottom of the lifts.  They are well-marked and easy to locate.\n\nThe canonical way to view Amanohashidate is to turn your back to it, then bend over and look at it upside down from between your legs — this is supposed to make the bridge appear as if it floats to heaven, and bring good luck.\n\nThe rotating bridge on the south side of Amanohashidate is unique, although it is by no means a must-see.
