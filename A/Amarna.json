This can be reached by tourist car \/ taxi from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mallawi"]]}," (which has a railway station) or from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Minya"]]},".

This is accessible by vehicle from Deir Mawas, along the road which passes the village of Beni Amran. From Deir Mawas to the ferry the distance is about 1.75 km (just over one mile). Deir Mawas also has a local railway station.

This passes through much of the ancient city. The greater part of a day should be allowed for this extended trip.
