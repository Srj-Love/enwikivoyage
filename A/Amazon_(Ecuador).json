Unless you are studying, teaching English or consulting on a project in the Amazon, you are unlikely to have enough knowledge about the area to stay safe and, most importantly, to learn about the plants and animals that make the area so special.\n\nIf you have more than a few days and you're not on a super tight budget, staying and traveling with a jungle lodge can be very rewarding. You're based right in the midst of the jungle, and, at the better lodges, you're in an area that's protected from farming, logging and drilling. You usually have 2-3 activities per day including birding hikes, canoe trips and fishing for piranhas. Again, at some of the better lodges, you usually have an indigenous guide that speaks English, French, etc. This ensures that you really get to see some amazing things like five different species of monkeys, caimans, tarantulas and lots and lots of birds.\n\nFor hard-core birders, most of the lodges offer special sight-seeing activities with much earlier wake-up calls.\n\nTypically, you pay one daily fee that includes transportation to\/from the airport, accommodations, meals and guides, and then snacks, alcohol and tips are over and above the fee.\n\nFees range from under $100USD to well over $250USD\/night depending on how you booked your stay. If you book directly with a lodge or if you book through an Ecuadorean travel agency, you generally get a better deal than one if your home country is USA.\n\nVisiting indigenous communities is usually really expensive and very hard to reach.  They are usually really deep in the jungle and access to them is only available by small Cessna planes.  There are also some luxury lodges which were foreign investments but now are owned by the community.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Bus"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Lago Agrio is an entrance by road and plain to the Ecuadorian Amazon about 7 hour by bus from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Quito"]]},"."]},{"type":"*","value":["Tena is an entrance point by road to Ecuadorian Amazon about 6 hours by bus from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Quito"]]},".

If you're staying at one of the jungle lodges, you'll be picked up at the airport (either Quito or Coca). Depending on how deep you're going, your boat ride will be anywhere from 3–6 hours long...or more.\n\nIf you're not staying at a jungle lodge, you can usually hitch a ride on one of the boats plying the rivers. Just be sure to bring a rain poncho to protect against frequent afternoon storms. If boating's not your thing, there is a system of buses to get into the interior, but the trips are very long.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["Birdwatching"]},{"type":"*","value":["Jungle trek"]},{"type":"*","value":["Canoeing"]},{"type":"*","value":["Visit the communities"]},"You can travel alone or get some of the tours that the tourist agencies offer for this region of Ecuador.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["The Sacha Lodge ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.sachalodge.com\/"]}," email is: reservas@sachalodge.com.
