That is to say, if you are trying to fly to some crazy place like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mitú"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Inírida"]]},", consider it a bold trip and include extra days in your schedule for flight disruptions.

Fishing is likely the regions favorite sport (but followed closely, of course, by football), with piranha fishing being especially popular with the visitors. Boating the rivers provides incredible opportunities for wildlife spotting: river dolphins, tapirs, caymans, golden eagles—with the immense biodiversity of the rainforest, you will hardly scratch the surface. It is quite worthwhile to do some trekking in the jungle as well. Although trekking is not as great for wildlife spotting, a good guide will help you identify the interesting flora and sounds of the jungle, and may be able to take you to a local village or a ",{"type":"''","value":["maloca"]},".

For fish, look out for local favorites like ",{"type":"''","value":["pirarucú"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["dorado"]},". The former is leaner but delicious and the latter very fatty and rich. Piranha is another common local food, since the Amazon is really full of them.

Tasting much like a sweeter version of bourbon, the drink is more popular with locals inside the jungle, rather than in the towns, where it is generally not commercially available. It's actually pretty great for a jungle trek, as the plant contains a strong stimulant (and, reputedly, aphrodisiac) effect, in addition to conditional medicinal benefits, treating ailments such as diarrhoea, arthritis, menstrual irregularities, and upset stomach.\n\n",{"type":"'''''","value":["Yagé"]}," (pronounced yah-HEY, with a very soft h) is a drink, known better in other countries as ",{"type":"''","value":["ayahuasca"]},", uniting virtually all the multitudinous and disparate indigenous cultures of Amazonia. A strong hallucinogen, its primary use is religious, for divination and healing. As it is potentially harmful, it should only be drank under the guidance of a shaman, who will both monitor your health, help you \"see\" more, and chant in the dark for hours on end. On the first use, yagé is likely to induce pretty serious vomiting and diarrhoea. If you are very interested in the drink, culture, and tradition it may be worthwhile to schedule two nights in a row with a shaman, which will really boost your chances of experiencing something more interesting.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nYou might assume that the remote jungle lands of Colombia might be the refuge of the FARC, but the fact is that much of it is ",{"type":"''","value":["too"]}," remote for even guerrillas to operate.

The area around Leticia, in particular, would be an impossible target for militants even if they were interested in traveling so far south—the Colombian military presence in its tri-border region with Peru and Brazil is immense. Western Putumayo and Caquetá, as well as northern Guaviare, however are real hotbeds of guerrilla activity and should be left off all itineraries. The conflict may impact trips to other remote capitals, but the extreme problems of mass assaults on towns and frequent hostage-takings seem to have died down in the last ten years.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\nThe Colombian Amazon is pretty remote.
