It has a number of interesting historical and cultural sites, among the remnants of forts built by the Dutch East Indies Company during the heyday of the spice trade. The ruins of the Portuguese fort at Hila are almost entirely hidden beneath the contorted roots of a giant Banyan tree. The ANZAC War Cemetery near Ambon town is the site of services held every year on April 25, to commemorate the Allied soldiers who died in region during World War II. The museum Siwa Lima has a fine collection of local arts and crafts. Ambon is at the Maluku end of the annual yacht race between Darwin, Australia and Ambon. The race usually takes place in July and August.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]}," \n\nThere are daily flights from Jakarta to Ambon, either direct or via Makassar or Surabaya. \nThere are Garuda Indonesia(GA), Lion Air(JT), Sriwijaya(SJ),Batavia Air(Y6).\n\n\nAlternatively there are boats from various parts of Indonesia. Schedules change frequently, but any travel agent in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jakarta"]]}," or a major Indonesian city can arrange this.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nBemos (public transport minivans, locally called angkutan or angkot) with pre-ordained routes take people around the island.  There are no fixed stops, just flag one down in the street.  Look at the sign on top of the bus to make sure it's the route you want.  Each costs 2,000Rp -- pay when you get out.  Sitting up front is fine, if it's empty and you'd rather not squish into the back.  To stop where you want to get out, say \"minggir\".\n\nBecaks (bicycle rickshaw) are good for shorter distances downtown.\n\nThere are many ojeks (passenger motorcycles) around the island.\n\nTaxis are also available for hire and can be found mostly in major hotels.\n\nA map of the city is available on the second floor of the bookstore Dian Pertiwi, at the corner of Jl. P. Diponegoro and Jl. Said Perintah, by the tall white Trikora monument.\n\nIf you want to going to city from the airport you can use the DAMRI bus, it's located on the right side of the arrival hall, it only cost you Rp. 25000. Cheaper than taking a taxi which can cost you approximately Rp. 150.000\/trip. the DAMRI bus stops on the Merdeka Court on the heart of Ambon City.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Siwa Lima Museum"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Commonwealth war graves"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Namalatu beach area"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Pintu Kota"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Waii eels"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Liang Beach"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Tulehu Hotwater"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Natsepa Beach"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Martha Christina Tiahahu statue"]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nSnorkeling \/ Diving on Latuhalat or Liang beach.
