Some of the consonants can be followed by an additional -s, making: -gs, -ngs, -bs, -ms.\n\n-ng, -m, -n is exactly as in English. -r is a Scottish rolling r or an American -r (but not changing the vowel as in English!). -g and -b can be pronounced in two ways: hard (-ck, -pp) or soft (-kh\/-gh, -v). A final -l and a final -d are pronounced alike, either as \"t\" or a clear \"l\". In some places however, \"ul\" and \"il\" are pronounced like \"oo\" and \"ee\" rather than \"uht\".\n\nA final -s is lost, so \"legs\" is pronounced \"lack\", not \"lacks\". Most importantly, if the -s follows the vowel (as, es, ...), the vowel sound is changed into \"ee\". \"dus\" (time, when) is read \"dee\", not \"duhs\", for example.\n\n\"ing\" and \"ang\" are pronounced alike, as \"ang\" or \"uhng\"; while \"ung\" is pronounced \"oong\".\n\nThe genitive suffix (like \"'s\" in English) \"-'i\", modifies the vowel sound into \"ee\", except for a Written \"o\", which turns into \"oo\".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Phrase list"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Basics"]},"\n; Hello. : bde mo (",{"type":"''","value":["vdeh-maw"]},") (literally \"well\")\n; How are you? : khyod bde mo yin na (",{"type":"''","value":["chaw vdeh-maw yuhn-NAH"]},")\n; Fine, thank you. : bde mo yin, bde mo yin (",{"type":"''","value":["vdeh-maw yuhn, vdeh-maw yuhn"]},") (You don't usually say the \"thank you\" bit)\n; What is your name? : khyo'i mying nga chi zer (",{"type":"''","value":["choo nyuhng-ngah chuh zehr"]},")\n; My name is ______ . : ngi mying nga ____ zer ra (",{"type":"''","value":["nguh nyuhng-ngah _______ zeh-rah"]},")\n; I can't speak Tibetan [well]. : nga bod skad [yag po] ma shes.
