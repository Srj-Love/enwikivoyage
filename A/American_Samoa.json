Also the whole island group, including Samoa, are often identified as the Samoan islands.\n\nSettled as early as 1000 BCE by Polynesian navigators, Samoa was reached by European explorers in the 18th century. International rivalries in the latter half of the 19th century were settled by an 1899 treaty in which Germany (later Britain) and the US divided the Samoan archipelago. The US formally occupied its portion, a smaller group of eastern islands with the excellent harbor of Pago Pago in the following year.\n\nAmerican Samoa is warm, humid and rainy year-round, but there is a long, wet summer season (October - May) and a slightly cooler and drier season (June - September). Total annual rainfall is 125 inches at the Tafuna airport and 200+ inches in mountainous areas. Such rainfall gave the English writer Somerset Maugham the name for his short story \"Rain\", based in Pago Pago, which was subsequently turned into a play and movie.\n\n90% of the land in the group of islands is communally owned. Economic activity is strongly linked to the US and the greater part of its foreign trade is with the US. The private sector is dominated by tuna fishing and the tuna processing plants, canned tuna being the primary export. Monetary transfers from the US Government also add substantially to American Samoa's economic well-being. Since the emergence of US influence and control the government of the United States of America has put up resistance to the emergence of local independence movements. In the early 20th century the American Samoa Mau movement was actively suppressed by the U.S. Navy.\n\nThe Governor of American Samoa is the head of government and exercises executive power. American Samoa is an unincorporated and unorganized territory of the United States, administered by the Office of Insular Affairs, U.S. Department of the Interior. Its constitution was ratified in 1966 and came into effect in 1967.\n\nIn both American Samoa and (independent) Samoa there is traditional village political system common to all of the Samoa Islands, the \"fa'amatai\" and the \"fa'asamoa\"  interacts across the current international boundaries. The Fa'asamoa represents language and customs, and the Fa'amatai the protocols of the \"fono\" (council) and the chief system. The Fa'amatai and the Fono take place at all levels of the Samoan body politic, from the family, to the village and include regional and national matters.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=American Samoa Visitors Bureau"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.americansamoa.travel"],["email=info@americansamoa.travel"],["address=Level 1, Suite #200, Haleck Center"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Corner Ottoville Rd & Ili'ili Rd, Ottoville, Pago Pago"],["phone=+1 684 699-9805"],["tollfree="],["fax=+1 684 699-9806"],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Fagatogo Dock.jpg"],["thumb"],["270px"],["Dock at Fagatogo, Pago Pago Harbor"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Visas"]},"\nAmerican Samoa lies outside federal U.S. immigration and customs jurisdiction.
