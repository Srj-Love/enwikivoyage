With more than one million inhabitants in its urban area, it is the country's largest city and its financial, cultural, and creative center. Amsterdam is colloquially known as ",{"type":"''","value":["Venice of the North"]},", because of its lovely canals that criss-cross the city, its impressive architecture and more than 1,500 bridges. There is something for every traveler's taste here, whether you prefer culture and history, serious partying, or just the relaxing charm of an old European city.\n\nSettled as a small fishing village in the late 12th century, Amsterdam became one of the most important trading centers in the world during the Dutch Golden Age of the 17th century. The city's small medieval center rapidly expanded as the Jordaan and the Canal District were constructed; the latter's cultural significance was acknowledged when it became a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["UNESCO World Heritage List"],["UNESCO World Heritage Site"]]}," in 2010.

Partly because of this, the city has an informal atmosphere unlike other capital cities its size. In fact, Amsterdam has a history of non-conformism, tolerance and progressivism, all of which come together in its liberal policies concerning cannabis and prostitution.

It corresponds to the city as it was around 1850. Five major concentric canals ring the Binnenstad: Singel, Herengracht, Keizersgracht, Prinsengracht and Singelgracht, together forming the Canal District. Other districts inside the city center are the Jordaan, a former working class area now popular with yuppies, and Plantage, a leafy and spacious area with botanical gardens and the zoo. The Nassaukade, Stadhouderskade and Mauritskade surround the city center and mark the location of the former city moat and fortifications. Almost everything outside this line was built after 1870.\n\nThe semi-circle is on the south side of the IJ, which is often called a river but more exactly is an estuary. Going east from Centraal Station, the railway passes the artificial islands of the redeveloped Eastern Docklands. North of the IJ is mainly housing, although a major dockland redevelopment has started there too.\n\nThe river Amstel flows into the city from the south. Originally, it flowed along the line Rokin-Damrak. The dam in the Amstel, which gives the city its name, was located under the present Bijenkorf department store near Dam Square. The original settlement was on the right bank of the Amstel, on the present Warmoesstraat: it is therefore the oldest street in the city. The city has expanded in all directions, except to the northeast of the A10 ring motorway. That area is a protected rural landscape of open fields and small villages considered a part of the Waterland region.\n\nThe radius of the semi-circle is about 2 km. All major tourist destinations, and most hotels, are located inside it or just outside it. As a result, a large swathe of Amsterdam is not visited by the average tourist: at least 90% of the population lives outside this area. Most economic activity in Amsterdam—the offices of the financial sector, the port—is near or outside the ring motorway, which is 4–5 km from the center.\n\nThe expansion of Amsterdam outside the ring motorway and the expansion of activity outside the city center is redefining what locals consider the 'central area' of Amsterdam. Zuid, especially with the construction of the Noord\/Zuidlijn and the Zuidas, is becoming more and more important in the daily lives of the locals. Its significance for tourists has increased by the recently completed reconstruction work on the Museumplein and the adjoining museums.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nAmsterdam was first referred to as ",{"type":"''","value":["Aemstelledamme"]}," (\"dam on the Amstel\") in 1204, and known as ",{"type":"''","value":["Aemsterdam"]}," by 1327. It was first part of Utrecht, and around 1300 Gwijde van Henegouwen, bishop of Utrecht, gave Amsterdam city rights. After his death, the city was inherited by Count William III and became a part of Holland. Two fires swept the city in 1421 and 1452, and few wooden buildings from this period remain. A notable exception is the ",{"type":"''","value":["Houten Huis"]}," (Wooden House) at the Begijnhof.\n\nIn 1558, the Dutch started to revolt against the Spanish as the local nobility demanded more political power and religious freedom. Amsterdam supported the Spanish, but as it became more and more isolated and trade suffered accordingly, it switched sides in 1578. A relative freedom of religion emerged in the newly established Dutch Republic, and many migrants sought refuge in Amsterdam, including Jews from the Iberian Peninsula, merchants from Antwerp and ",{"type":"''","value":["Huguenots"]}," (French Protestants). Catholicism could not be practiced openly.\n\nAmsterdam prospered in the 17th century and became one of the world's great cities. A global trading network and overseas possessions made Amsterdam the center of shipping in Europe and the world's leading financial center. The arts flourished too, with great painters like Rembrandt producing works that are widely acclaimed as of this day. The city expanded outside of its original boundaries as the Canal Belt was constructed for wealthy merchants and the Jordaan for the working class. Immigrants formed the majority of the population and there was a strong immigration from Lutheran Protestant Germans.\n\nThe Dutch Republic was not a unitary state, but a confederation in which the independent provinces and the larger cities were politically autonomous. There was a strong animosity between the Orange faction with its power base in The Hague, and the republican faction with Amsterdam as its most outspoken representative, up to the point that the city was beleaguered by the army. The Orange faction supported the idea of hereditary political leadership vested in the princes of Orange as Stadtholders, while the republican faction supported civic independence. This long-standing culture of republicanism and non-conformism against the political elites in The Hague exists as of this day.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Paleis op de Dam.jpg"],["300px"],["thumbnail"],["Royal Palace"]]},"\nThe 18th and 19th centuries were a turbulent period for Amsterdam. The economy suffered from decreased trade opportunities with the colonies and ongoing wars with the United Kingdom and France. Napoleon's brother Louis was crowded King of Holland in 1806 and took possession of the city hall on Dam Square, from then on referred to as the Royal Palace. The Netherlands was fully annexed by France in 1810, and Napoleon crowned Amsterdam \"third city\" of the French Empire. Prussian and Russian troops liberated the Netherlands, but it remained a unitary state and a monarchy, that now included Belgium.\n\nWhile The Hague had functioned as ",{"type":"''","value":["de facto"]}," capital of the Republic, Amsterdam (together with Brussels) became the new capital of the Kingdom. The appointment of Amsterdam as the new capital was a conciliatory gesture of the Orange faction towards the city and a recognition of the strong civic and republican basis of the new Kingdom. The Hague remained the seat of government and the political center of the country. When Belgium seceded in 1830, Amsterdam became the sole capital and got the rights to trade with the country's overseas possessions.\n\nThe North Sea Canal and Noordhollandsch Kanaal connected Amsterdam's harbor directly with the Rhine and the North Sea. The Industrial Revolution arrived around 1860, which led to strong economic growth, but also to overpopulation as the city could not cope with the sudden demographic surge. The Jordaan was a notorious working class slum in this period, and neighborhoods like De Pijp were built to provide housing as cheaply and quickly as possible for the lower middle class. Social issues that arose in this period made Amsterdam the center of social democracy in the country.\n\nIn World War II, German troops occupied the city and more than 100,000 Jews were deported, most famously Anne Frank. The diamond trade, before the war one of Amsterdam's top industries, almost completely disappeared as these businesses were mostly in the hands of Jews. The cultural revolution of the 1960s and 1970s changed Amsterdam radically. Soft drugs were tolerated, squatting became commonplace and riots with the police occurred on a daily basis. The coronation of Queen Beatrix in 1980 turned violent as protesters demanded a stop to the housing demolition that took place for the construction of Amsterdam's first metro line.\n\nIn recent decades, Amsterdam has lost some of its revolutionary appeal. It became a center for wealthy yuppies. Once poor districts like the Jordaan became upper class districts, and poorer inhabitants moved out of the center to the outer boroughs and other cities. The city's once progressive ideals have faded as squatting is cracked down on, coffeeshops are increasingly closed and prostitution is outlawed outside of the Red Light District. However, it is still a progressive and tolerant city by international standards. Its culture of republicanism and non-conformism are going through tough times as well, but the ubiquitous \"Republic of Amsterdam\" street signs show that it remains a defining characteristic of the city.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Attitudes"]},"\n\nMany people choose to visit Amsterdam because of its reputation for tolerance and progressivism. Prostitution is legalized and licensed in the Netherlands, so window prostitution is very visible in some areas of Amsterdam. The possession and consumption of small quantities of cannabis and hash, while technically illegal, is tolerated by authorities (the policy of ",{"type":"''","value":["gedogen"]},"). Coffeeshops are allowed to sell cannabis and hash for personal use, and Amsterdam has hundreds of these scattered over the city.\n\nThis does not mean that you can get away with anything in Amsterdam. In any case, public attitudes and official policy have hardened in recent years. The amount of coffeeshops has decreased significantly and new laws forbid the selling of dried hallucinogenic mushrooms. Window prostitution outside the Oudezijds Achterburgwal is slowly but surely being closed down by the local authorities.\n\nDepending on your viewpoint some people will consider Amsterdam an unwholesome city whereas other people will find the relaxed attitudes refreshing. If you avoid the Red Light District, Amsterdam is an excellent family destination.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh =   5"],["febhigh =   6"],["marhigh =   10"],["aprhigh =   14"],["mayhigh =   18"],["junhigh =   21"],["julhigh =   23"],["aughigh =   23"],["sephigh =   20"],["octhigh =   16"],["novhigh =   10"],["dechigh =   6"],["janlow =   0"],["feblow =   0"],["marlow =   2"],["aprlow =   4"],["maylow =   8"],["junlow =   11"],["jullow =   13"],["auglow =   12"],["seplow =   10"],["octlow =   7"],["novlow =   4"],["declow =   1"],["janprecip =  70"],["febprecip =  56"],["marprecip =  67"],["aprprecip =  42"],["mayprecip =  62"],["junprecip =  66"],["julprecip =  81"],["augprecip =  73"],["sepprecip =  78"],["octprecip =  83"],["novprecip =  80"],["decprecip =  76"],["description = Check ",{"type":"'''","value":["Amsterdam's 7 day forecast"]}," at ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.weer.nl\/wereldweer\/actueel-en-verwacht-weer\/stad\/31X4825\/amsterdam.html weer.nl"]}]]},"\n\nAmsterdam is a large city and a major tourist destination, so you can visit it all year round.

Since 3 June 2010, the 'strippenkaart' system has been abandoned on all forms of public transport in Amsterdam, making the ",{"type":"''","value":["OV-chipkaart"]}," the only valid way of traveling.

You can get them for 24 hours up to 168 hours. This allows the holder to travel on an unlimited number of journeys on the tram, metro and (night)bus throughout the validity period of the pass. On a tram, only the one day pass can be purchased from the conductor, so it's better to buy them at tourist offices (at Schiphol Airport and just outside Amsterdam Centraal), AKO bookstores, many hotels and GVB ticket offices.

It takes about 15–20 minutes from Centraal Station to Zuid or Bijlmer-ArenA in Zuidoost.\n\nA fifth metro line, the Noord\/Zuidlijn, is currently under construction. It's an underground metro line that will connect the north of Amsterdam directly with its southern suburbs, hence the name. This major project started in 2003 and has proved somewhat of a disaster for the local government with big budget overruns and delays. Building in the wet soil of Amsterdam is difficult and some buildings along the line have sustained damage due to subsidence. Visitors to Amsterdam will notice the ongoing roadworks along the route of the metro line. It is now estimated for completion in 2017.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Bus"]},"\n\nJust like the tram and metro, local buses are operated by the GVB.

All ferries are free of charge and provide nice views of the harbor and skyline.\n\nThe nicest one is the 15 min service to the NDSM-werf, a funky, up and coming, industrial neighborhood with a nice cafe-bar (IJkantine), restaurant (Noorderlicht), indoor skateboard park, and the Pancake Boat (",{"type":"''","value":["Pannenkoekenboot"]},") which sails many times each week. Ferries leave every 30 minutes from Amsterdam Centraal and from the NDSM-werf.

There are approximately 750,000 people living in Amsterdam and they own about 800,000 bicycles. The city is very, very bike-friendly, and there are separate bike lanes on most major streets. In the city center, however, there is often not enough space for a bike lane, so cars and cyclists share narrow streets.\n\nCyclists do not have the right of way even though it might appear like that when observing the typical Amsterdammer's cycling behavior. Be very careful and watch out for other cyclists. Always show other traffic where you're going (e.g. by holding out your hand) in order to avoid accidents and smoothen the traffic flow. If not indicated otherwise by signs, the right-before-left rule applies.\n\nAvoid getting your tire in the tram rails; it's a nasty fall. Always cross tram rails at an angle. When crossing tram lanes, watch out for fast approaching taxis. They have a rather ruthless driving style. Let none of the above deter you from doing it the Amsterdam way. Rent a bike! There are bike rental shops at railway stations and several others in and around the city center. Bikes cost about €9 to €20 per day. (Bring wet gear.)\n \nA good map for cycling (routes, repairs, rentals and also public transport) is ",{"type":"''","value":["Amsterdam op de fiets"]}," (a Cito-plan). Bicycles can be taken for free on all ferries across the IJ, on all metros, and on some carriages of tram 26 with a bike supplement fee on the ",{"type":"''","value":["OV-chipkaart"]}," (€1.60 in 2013, not allowed in rush hours). Use the special bike racks, locations indicated by a bicycle sign on the outside of the carriage.\n\nMake sure to get a good lock (or two), and to use it. Amsterdam has one of the highest bicycle theft rates in the world. Note also that if buying a bike, prices that seem too good to be true are stolen bikes. Any bike offered for sale to passers-by, on the street, is certainly stolen. There's an old Amsterdam joke: when calling out to a large group of cyclists passing by \"Hey, that's my bike!\" about five people will jump off \"their\" bikes and start running.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Black Bikes"],["alt=Het Zwarte Fietsenplan"],["url=http:\/\/www.black-bikes.com"],["email="],["address=Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal 146"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=tram 1, 2, 5, 13 or 17 to Dam"],["phone=+31 20 670-8531"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=M-F 08:00-20:00, Sa Su 09:00-19:00"],["price=€9 (3 hr), €13 (24 hr)"],["content=Rent traditional black bikes.

Hailing taxis on the street is generally not to be recommended unless you are going to a well-known destination (e.g. Centraal Station or Schiphol). The recent liberalization of the taxi market in Amsterdam led to an influx of taxi drivers who have little or no clue of where they are going and who drive erratically and dangerously (e.g., driving on bicycle lanes instead of the main road or ignoring red lights). Tourists are advised to stick to public transport if at all possible. Get into a taxi only if you know the route yourself and are able to give directions to the taxi driver and if you know roughly how much the journey ought to cost so you don't get cheated.\n\nSome drivers, traditionally at Centraal Station or Leidseplein, will refuse short trips or will quote outrageously high fares, even though all taxis are metered. Even if you convince the driver to use the meter, he will often take a circuitous route that racks up €15 or more on the meter. For reference, no trip within the historic center should cost more than €10 or so. In 2012, the car service Uber (using their mobile app) became available in Amsterdam. Although slightly more expensive than a normal taxi, you can avoid a lot of the problems associated with taking an Amsterdam taxi from busy areas (Centraal Station\/Leidseplein) and at peak evening hours.\n\nThe Netherlands (and Amsterdam) is in the middle of a huge taxi liberalization scheme which has been jarring to all involved. After many missteps, the government has introduced an unusual pricing scheme.  First you feel sticker shock as the initial fare is now €7.50. Luckily, that includes the first two kilometres of travel and there is no charge for waiting in traffic. If you need to run in somewhere, you need to negotiate a waiting fee with the driver. 50 cents per minute is customary.\n\nUnlicensed, illegal cabbies operate mainly in Zuidoost. These aren't easily recognized as such, and most certainly don't drive Mercedes cars. They are known as ",{"type":"''","value":["snorders"]}," and most easily reached by mobile phone. Rides within Zuidoost (the Bijlmer) range from €2.50 to €5, whereas Zuidoost-Center can run up to €12.50. ",{"type":"''","value":["Snorders"]}," have a shady reputation, so consider their services only if you are adventurous.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Tuk-tuks"]},", a Thai-influenced transportation service using three-wheeled, open-air (but covered) motorized vehicles was introduced in August 2007 and may be a more economical and fast way to get around the city center compared to metered taxis. Tuk-tuk pricing is based on a zone system. Within a zone, a ride is €3.50 per person, €5 for 2 persons and €6.50 for 3 persons. If you go to another zone, €3.50 is added (irrespective of number of persons). This service is handy if past the regular tram\/bus\/metro service hours (approximately half past midnight). They take reservations 24 hr\/day (☎ 0900 993-3399) and there is a fee of €0.55 per call.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nIt is practical to use a ",{"type":"'''","value":["car"]}," only outside of the historic center; within the historic center, a traveler is advised to stay with public transport. In Amsterdam, a car is generally a liability and not an asset. Use a car only if you are going to an obscure location many kilometers out that is not served by public transport. Driving here is a pain: many of the streets are narrow, the traffic (and parking) signs are baroque and obscure, and cyclists and pedestrians may get in your way. Plus, petrol is about €1.54 to €1.7 per liter.\n\nYou can try parking at one of the secured parking garages, for example under Museumplein, or near Centraal Station, and then walk around the city center, or get on a tram. Car parking is very expensive in Amsterdam and it's often hard to find a place to park. You can choose to pay by the hour or for the whole day. Parking is free outside the center on Sunday—there is always a spot available on the Albert Cuypstraat (which is a market during the rest of the week). From there, it is a 5 minute tram ride or 15 minutes walk to the city center.\n\nYou can park for free in some parts of Amsterdam outside the city center though this is slowly changing. Parking is still free in some areas in Noord, and you can take the bus from the Mosplein stop to the city center easily. Plenty of buses run through here. Another option is to park your car far outside the city center at a Park and Ride facility. For €8 you get a full day (24 hr) of parking and a return ticket to the city center. The ride takes about 15 minutes. Look for the P+R signs.\n\nPopular car rental chains operate in a smaller capacity in Amsterdam, including Avis and Budget.

The oldest streets are the Warmoesstraat and the Zeedijk in the ",{"type":"''","value":["Oudezijde"]}," of the Binnenstad. As buildings were made of wood in the Middle Ages, not much of this period's buildings have survived. Two ",{"type":"'''","value":["medieval wooden houses"]}," did survive though, at Begijnhof 34 and Zeedijk 1. Other old houses are Warmoesstraat 83 (built around 1400), Warmoesstraat 5 (around 1500) and Begijnhof 2-3 (around 1425). The ",{"type":"'''","value":["Begijnhof"]}," is a late-medieval enclosed courtyard with the houses of beguines, Roman Catholic women living in a semi-religious community. Beguines are found in Northern France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and north-western Germany. House number 34 at the Begijnhof is the oldest home in Amsterdam. Entry to the courtyard and surrounding gardens is free, but be careful not to disturb the local community still living here.\n\nOne of the most prominent features is the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amsterdam\/Canal District"],["Canal District"]]},", a concentric ring of canals built in the 17th century. The merchant-based oligarchy that ruled the trading city of Amsterdam built canal houses and mansions in the most prestigious locations here, especially along the main canals. Typical for the country are its traditional white draw bridges. The best example has to be the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Magere Brug"]},", which is over 300 years old and nearly in its original capacity. It is a beautiful place to overlook the river and take in some traditional Dutch architecture.\n\nThe ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amsterdam\/Jordaan"],["Jordaan"]]}," was built around 1650 along with the Canal District, but not for the wealthy merchants. For a long time it was considered a typical working-class area, and included some notorious slums. The name probably derives from the nickname 'Jordan' for the Prinsengracht. Apart from a few wider canals, the streets are narrow, in an incomplete grid pattern (as the grid followed the lines of the former polders located here in medieval times). This district is the best example of \"gentrification\" in the Netherlands, as recently it turned into a hip boutique district.\n\nThere are several ",{"type":"'''","value":["large warehouses"]}," for more specific uses. The biggest is the Admiralty Arsenal (1656-1657), now ",{"type":"'''","value":["Het Scheepvaartmuseum"]}," at Kattenburgerplein.

Between 1590 and 1800, the estimated foreign-born population was never less than 5 percent, many of them settling in Amsterdam. This led to a large diaspora of Jews, Huguenots (French Protestants), Flemish, Poles and other peoples in the city.

The most prominent synagogue is ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Esnoga"]}," (or ",{"type":"''","value":["The Portuguese Synagogue"]},"), built in 1675 in an austere Classicist style.\n\nAs the Netherlands was a Protestant nation, most of the churches are from this branch of Christianity. The oldest church in Amsterdam, the Netherlands-gothic ",{"type":"'''","value":["Oude Kerk"]}," on the Oudezijds Voorburgwal at Oudekerksplein, is now surrounded by window prostitution. It was built in 1306, and became a Calvinist church after the Reformation in 1578. The ",{"type":"'''","value":["Nieuwe Kerk"]},", at Dam Square, dates from the 15th century and is now used for royal coronations and exhibitions. From the 17th century onwards, four compass churches were built that would serve the areas outside the Binnenstad.\n\nThe late-medieval city also had smaller chapels such as the Sint Olofskapel (circa 1440) on Zeedijk, and convent chapels such as the Agnietenkapel on the Oudezijds Voorburgwal 231 (originally 1470), now the University of Amsterdam museum. Later churches included the Oosterkerk (1669) in the eastern islands, and the heavily restored Lutheran Church on the Singel (1671), now used by a hotel as a conference centre. Catholic churches were long forbidden, and built again only in the 19th-century. The most prominent is the Neo-Baroque Church of St. Nicholas (1887) opposite Centraal Station.

Coffeeshops (in English, but written as one word; not to be confused with coffeehouses or cafes) are allowed to sell ",{"type":"'''","value":["cannabis"]}," and hash for personal use (not more than 5 grams). While ",{"type":"''","value":["technically"]}," still illegal, mostly to comply to international treaties, personal use of (soft) drugs are regulated by the Ministry of Justice under an official policy of ",{"type":"''","value":["gedogen"]},"; literally this means ",{"type":"''","value":["to accept"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["tolerate"]},", legally it is a doctrine of non-prosecution on the basis that action taken would be so highly irregular as to constitute selective prosecution. The city council of Amsterdam allows coffeeshops to operate only with the provision of set, non-transferable licenses as shown by an official green and white sticker on the window of a coffeeshop. Coffeeshops are to sell only soft drugs (such as cannabis), selling of other drugs is not allowed. Also selling of dried hallucinogenic mushrooms is not allowed.\n\nThere are about 250 coffeeshops in Amsterdam, most of them in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amsterdam\/Binnenstad"],["Binnenstad"]]},". Marijuana is mostly sold in one-gram increments with a maximum limit of 5 grams per transaction. Prices hover around €7.50 for 1 gram, with the average joint holding around 0.33g. Most coffeeshops are happy to recommend varieties and prepare your joint for you. Some offer vaporizers\/inhalators for people who don't want to smoke. Smoking paraphernalia (grinders, rolling papers, bongs, vaporizers, etc.) is usually available upon request. It is common practice not to smoke at a coffeeshop without purchasing something from the establishment first, be it coffee, a Coke, or marijuana. All coffeeshops do, indeed, sell coffee as well. ID is requested upon entrance to each establishment, and more often than not the only acceptable ID (except for Dutch citizens) is a passport.\n\nMany coffeeshops offer a 'smoking lounge' where soft drugs may be used. Also note that despite the confusion on the subject, the country-wide smoking ban applies only to tobacco. However, since the Dutch commonly smoke tobacco mixed with their marijuana or hash, many coffeeshops, especially those unaccustomed to tourists, may require all smoking to be done in a separated smoking section or outdoors. Most central coffeeshops with large tourist clientèles will allow marijuana or hash smoking in their entire space, requiring you to smoke in the separated section only if your joint contains tobacco. Many coffeeshops also provide a non-tobacco herbal filler for those who find pure joints too strong. You may usually smoke joints containing this herbal filler anywhere within the coffeeshop although individual house rules may vary. If in doubt, always ask the staff.\n\nAmsterdam hosts the Cannabis Cup, the most important marijuana related event in the world every year during the week of Thanksgiving. The Cannabis Cup is organized by High Times magazine, and offers both tourists and natives the chance to enjoy 5 days of consuming and judging marijuana in different forms. Participants are eligible to pay $199 in advance or €250 at the door to obtain a \"judges pass\", which allows entry to the event for all five days, admission to numerous concerts and seminars held during the event, the ability to vote on numerous awards that are handed out, and free bus tours to and from the event. Day passes are available for €30 for each day, and certain concerts sell tickets at the door provided they are not already sold out.\n\nCoffeeshops are increasingly being controlled by the Dutch government. The amount of coffeeshops has decreased significantly since 1995, and no alcohol may be sold inside a coffeeshop. As of 1 January 2013, non-residents (e.g. all tourists) are legally banned from entering a coffeeshop in the Netherlands. However, municipalities have a large freedom in implementing the law, and Amsterdam currently does not have any plans for implementation, but the future is uncertain.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Red Light District"]},"\n\nThe Red Light District consists of several canals, and the side streets between them, south of Centraal Station and east of Damrak. It is known as ",{"type":"''","value":["De Wallen"]}," (the quays) in Dutch, because the canals were once part of the city defences (walls and moats). Prostitution itself is limited to certain streets, mainly side streets and alleys, but the district is considered to include the canals, and some adjoining streets.\n\nThe area has many sex shops and peep show bars. This section of town is a common attraction for bachelors celebrating a stag night; if you ever get hassled, a firm and loud \"leave me alone\" will work most of the time. The whole area has a heavy police presence, and many security cameras. Nevertheless it is still a residential district and has many bars and restaurants, and also includes historic buildings and museums.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleeppricerange"],["Under €80"],["€80 to €150"],["Over €150"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["SeeDistricts"]]},"\n\nAmsterdam has over 400 registered hotels of varying standards from budget facilities to some of the most expensive hotels in Europe. Advance booking is recommended, especially for weekends and holidays. Don't expect you'll find an affordable bed once you're here. Most hotels and hostels can be found in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amsterdam\/Binnenstad"],["Binnenstad"]]},", notably south of Centraal Station, and in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amsterdam\/Zuid"],["Zuid"]]}," around the Museum Quarter.

Some cheaper hostels can also be found in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amsterdam\/Binnenstad"],["Red Light District"]]},".\n\nA simple bed in a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["hostel"]]}," starts around €15 on weekdays in the winter and up to €90 on a weekend in the summer. Hostels often expect you to book at least 2 nights in a weekend. A twin room in a budget hotel, 1-2 stars, might cost around €40 on weekdays in the winter and up to €100 on summer weekends. In a three and four star hotel, the prices would range from €100 to €200, depending on season, and five stars hotels can cost between €150 and €400 a night.\n\nDo not expect a wide amount of services from cheaper end hostels and hotels. Most of these do not have elevators and have the usual steep staircases; if you suffer from vertigo, do get an assurance that you will be getting a first or second floor room or book a hotel that has an elevator.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nIt might surprise some visitors, but Amsterdam is one of Europe's safest cities. It has an overall easy-going, laid-back feel and crime is not common. Amsterdam is female friendly, women can easily travel alone here and feel comfortable and safe. Gay and lesbian travelers also have little to worry about. However, you should take normal precautions against scams, pickpockets and baggage theft, especially in the main shopping streets, in trams and trains, at stations, and anywhere where tourists congregate.\n\nWhat looks like a footpath, especially along a canal bank, may be a ",{"type":"'''","value":["bike lane"]},". Bike lanes are normally marked by red\/purple tiles or asphalt, and a bike icon on the ground. However, the color fades over time, so you might miss the difference. Don't expect cyclists to be kind to pedestrians: some consider the side-walk an extension of the road, to be used when it suits them. Never stay or walk on the bike path or street for extended periods of time, as you will be greeted only by angry bell ringing. Keep in mind that for many Amsterdammers, the bike is their main means of transportation.\n\nWatch out for ",{"type":"'''","value":["trams"]}," when crossing the street. Taxis are also allowed to use some tram lanes, and even if not allowed, they often use them anyway. If you're driving, always give way to trams unless you're driving on a priority road.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Neighborhoods"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Amsterdam-unsafety-map.svg"],["400px"],["thumb"],["Safe and unsafe neighborhoods in Amsterdam"]]},"\n\nThe city center is generally safe, but there are differences between the neighborhoods. Leidseplein and Rembrandtplein are the tourist traps of Amsterdam, so prices are relatively high and there are lots of scams. Zeedijk and Warmoesstraat had a reputation for gang violence and riots in the 1970s and 1980s, but the security situation has improved strongly and now it is safe to visit.\n\nBe cautious in the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Red Light District"]},". All kinds of people walk around there during the day, including families with children, but the area does attract seedier visitors and vagrants after sunset. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Do not take photographs of the prostitutes"]},", you will be yelled at or worse. Groups of women visiting the Red Light District at night might feel harassed in the aggressive environment, though this is said to be the safest area because of the police presence. Keep to main streets and groups. Although not really dangerous, women might want to avoid the narrow lane north of the Oude Kerk after dark as the atmosphere can be quite intimidating.\n\nOther areas in the city center are mostly safe, but can get pretty much deserted after midnight, so you might want to avoid walking alone there at night. This is also true for the Kalverstraat and Nieuwendijk, even though shops are lit all night.\n\nThe outer boroughs have profound differences in safety levels. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amsterdam\/West"],["Nieuw-West"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amsterdam\/Zuidoost"],["Zuidoost"]]}," still have a bruised image regarding violence and harassment. Recent urban renewal projects have improved conditions in the last few years, but you should still be aware of the situation. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amsterdam\/Noord"],["Noord"]]}," also has some rougher neighborhoods, but the rural parts are safe. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amsterdam\/Oost"],["Oost"]]}," is largely safe, but there are some neighborhoods east of Oosterpark where some travelers might not feel comfortable. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amsterdam\/Zuid"],["Zuid"]]}," is perfectly safe, even at night.\n\nNeighborhoods with a bad reputation might still be worth seeking out, but be cautious at day and avoid at night. As most tourists only visit the city center and Zuid, they do not have much to worry about except for the usual precautions (e.g. scams and pickpockets).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Cannabis and other drugs"]},"\n\nIt cannot be denied that many tourists come to Amsterdam for the coffeeshops. If you're not a smoker, and you really want to try it, start with something light, make sure you don't have an empty stomach, and don't combine it with any other drugs or intoxicants, including alcohol. Be forthright with the counter person about your inexperience, they see it all the time. Go with an experienced person if you can. Regardless of the strength, your first experience can be quite a sensation at first, but will quickly decrease in intensity. You may want to plan to return to your hotel and \"hole up\" for a couple hours until you become comfortable with the feeling. If you do find yourself too strongly under the influence—feeling nauseated, woozy or faint—drink orange juice or eat something sweet like cookies or candy, and get fresh air.  Dutch-grown ",{"type":"''","value":["nederwiet"]}," (a.k.a. super skunk) is much stronger than you might expect, even if you are experienced. The THC level can be as high as 15%, twice the norm.\n\nQuality varies. Coffeeshops aimed at tourists are more likely to have overpriced and poor quality products. A simple rule of thumb is: if the place looks good and well-kept chances are their wares will be good as well. Don't just enter a coffeeshop being overwhelmed that it's possible at all to buy and consume cannabis openly: be discerning as to the quality. Coffeeshops sell only soft drugs such as marijuana and hash—asking for other drugs is pointless because coffeeshops are watched closely by the authorities, and nothing will get them closed faster than having hard drugs for sale.\n\nThere's a small chance you will be approached by people offering to sell you hard drugs in the street, especially as you are walking through the Red Light District. Ignoring (or failing that, a firm refusal) is enough—they will not pester you. The selling of drugs in the street is illegal and often dangerous; moreover the drugs sold to strangers are usually fake. When they invite you to see the goods, they can lure you into a narrow street and rob you.\n\nThe usage of ",{"type":"'''","value":["magic mushrooms"]}," has been forbidden since December 2008. So-called ",{"type":"'''","value":["smartshops"]}," do not sell any illegal products, but a range of dietary supplements, including 'herbal exstacy'—a legal attempt at an ecstasy pill alternative which is a complete waste of money with various more or less obscure psychedelic herbs and, despite the change in the law, one type of magic mushrooms. It is the latter which causes problems as people often underestimate their strength. Magic mushrooms have few physical risks attached to them, but can have a very strong short-acting psychological effect, which can either be great or very distressing, depending on your own mindset (e.g. if you are relaxed, have any serious worries, history of mental illness, etc.) and your surroundings (e.g. if you feel comfortable and safe in them).\n\nThe first time you try this should always be in a familiar and trusted environment, not on the streets of an unfamiliar city. If you do decide to try it please get informed first. ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.consciousdreams.nl\/ Conscious Dreams"]},", the company that invented the entire concept of a 'smartshop' back in 1994 does this clearly and responsibly (without downplaying the possible risks just to sell more like some other shops do). Also plan well ahead, make sure you have thought out where you will be. Most recommended is going to a large park like the Vondelpark, the Rembrandtpark or the Amsterdamse Bos where it is quiet, and there is no risk from traffic. Make sure that being intoxicated will not endanger your safety, or that of anybody else. Be sure to make your purchase in a smartshop rather than a coffeeshop. They are better regulated and information is available from the attendants that work there. They are also of better quality and stronger potency than at the coffeeshops.\n\nIf you're not sure of how much to take, take a small dose. Then you'll know what your \"tolerance\" level is. People that have bad trips are those who take a dosage over their own tolerance level. Never take more than one packet of mushrooms—usually half is good for your first time. A good smart shop can give you more information about this.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Pharmacies"]},"\n\nIt might be surprisingly difficult to find a pharmacy in the center, especially a one open in the late afternoon.

That's why pay phones mostly cater to tourists and can be found around tourist areas. Centraal Station has pay phones in groups of six near the main entrance. If making local calls from a pay phone, you may need a phone card (€5 minimum) as many green KPN telephone booths do not accept coins. Phone cards can be bought at post offices and some delis, although the cards are increasingly hard to find. The KPN booths are currently being replaced by newer models that will accept coins again. Blue\/orange Telfort booths accept both coins and cards.\n\nIf you need to make a call and do not have access to a pay phone, local phone or hotel phone, it is best to go to a ",{"type":"'''","value":["phone shop"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["belwinkel"]},").
