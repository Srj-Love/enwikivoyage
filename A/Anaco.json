[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["S-amer africa default banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Anaco"]}," is a smaller town in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Venezuela"]]}," of about less than 200,000 people in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Northeast (Venezuela)"],["northeastern"]]}," state, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Anzoategui"]]},". Anaco has grown since its founding in the late 1940s.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nTropical; hot, humid; more moderate in highlands. Wear light clothing, try to have water with you at all times. The roads and highways are a little bumpy. Venezuela uses a 60 Hz and 120 V power system. The power plugs are identical to those used in North America (referred to as A and B type power plugs). Everyone pretty much in Anaco speaks Spanish. Very few people speak and understand English. It wouldn't hurt to try to speak English to a towns person. Try to have patience and show respect when speaking with strangers. Also try to speak a little Spanish to them. If you are fluent in Spanish then you shouldn't have much trouble getting around. Use caution and common sense when asking for help from strangers.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nIf arriving by plane from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Maiquetia"]]},", there are domestic flights to the state capital, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Barcelona (Venezuela)"],["Barcelona"]]},". You shouldn't need to show your passport if you already passed immigration in Caracas but officials may ask for your paperwork anyway and ask where you are headed and\/or where are you coming from.\n\nA taxi from the airport to Anaco takes about 40 mins to one hour but can be quite expensive. There are also buses to Anaco from Barcelona and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Puerto La Cruz"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nMost if not all car drivers drive faster and disregard signs. Redlights are sometimes passed up. When you are in a barrio, it is advised that you drive slow and stop at the corners of intersections and look for oncoming cars. Anaco, like the rest of Venezuela, is a walking country. Everyone within the town usually walks to where they need to go. Tourists should be with a guide from the area preferbly with a small group. Walking should be avoided at night. Try to do your sightseeing during daylight hours. If you plan to walk, again, it is encouraged that you have local guide. Also, try to have a small group walk with you. There are certain barrios that should be avoided. But if you have to go to it, best thing to do is use common sense and good judgement. If you are traveling to other towns\/cities, you may pass military checkpoints. You have to slow down and pass slowly. You will usually be waived to pass, unless a military officer wants to stop you and check your IDs. If they ask you to step out of the car and search your belongings, you should watch how they are checking through your baggage. The police and military are corrupt. They plant a substance in your baggage saying it was yours. Best thing to do is, give them a good bribe and they will let you go. Bribing them is the only way for them to let you pass if you are stopped at a checkpoint.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\nAnaco has Unicasa, a major grocery store. There are a few smaller stores such as convenient stores and pharmacies. Most of the shopping is done at Avenida Miranda. There are many different stores to shop at. You may ask for a discount. Be a little wary of independent merchants on the streets. They may say one price and then say a different one. Try to avoid these. Be on the look out for pickpockets and people appearing to be beggars. Do not flash money around as you are prone to beggars and thieves. Try to keep your money in your pocket til you are about buy whatever it is your purchasing.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nYou can have arepas, a hamburger made the Venezuelan way with eggs, ham, lettuce, tomato, and anything else you want on it. You can also come down the Gran Rotti on Avenue Portuegasa for some delicous pastelito's. The owners are nice and one of them speaks fluent English.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nTry having the world famous Polar beer. You can also try Reginal. They also have some Smirnoff Ice. They also have other beers to try as well.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nAs with all of Venezuela, Anaco has crime too. As stated earlier, there are crime ridden barrios that should be avoided. One of them that should be avoided unless you have another person or group with you, is barrio Flores.\nWhen you walk almost anywhere in Anaco, you may be approached by a beggar. You can nicely say ",{"type":"''","value":["no tengo nada, gracias"]}," or if you wish, you may give them a few coins so they will leave you alone. There should be little fear with them as they only want some food or a little of bolivarez. Do not flash money around and do not look wealthy. Do not wear real flashy, expensive jewelry. These should be left at your hotel or place where you're staying, locked up safely. Be a little wary of cab drivers. There have been some reports of cab drivers exploited riders. Be cautious of this.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\nYou may have some diarrhea issues adjusting to the foods and liquids in Venezuela. You should preferbly buy bottled water.
