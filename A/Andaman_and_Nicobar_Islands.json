Neither class is air-conditioned, but ocean breezes keep temperatures tolerable, and a canteen dishes out chai, samosas and bottled water.  Due to their larger size, they're more stable in heavy seas, but take about twice as long as tourist ferries to get anywhere.\n\nThere's a new a\/c catamaran ferry from Port Blair to Havelock.  Tickets are 650, 750 or 1000 (which gets you a leather seat and your own TV) and can be booked from a dedicated ticket booking window at Port Blair, thus avoiding the queue barging, and through your guesthouse (or wild orchid, emerald gecko & andaman bubbles) on Havelock.\n\nIn high season demand often exceeds supply, so book your tickets at least one day in advance, either through a travel agent or directly at Port Blair's harbour.  Ferry ticket booking has now been computerised.  This means you can book any ferry from any jetty - i.e. Rangat to Havelock from the Diglipur ferry jetty.
