The northwestern provinces of Argentina, including Salta and Jujuy, are more like parts of Argentina's Andean neighbors Peru and Bolivia in terms of terrain, culture, and way of life. There tends to be more domestic than foreign tourism to this part of Argentina. Due to this you may find many unexpected amenities (as well as transplanted porteños looking for renewal) in the small pueblos along the quebrada, or mountain chain, which is said to have \"siete colores\", which describes the stratified layers of minerals in the mountains which appear to be red, orange, pink, green, etc. The winters are dry, warm during the day and cool during the evening.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nSalta, Tucuman and Jujuy have airports with connections to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Buenos Aires"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cordoba (city, Argentina)"],["Cordoba"]]},".\n\nThere are excellent connections on long-distance buses with the rest of the country.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Enjoy the breathtaking scenery and the great view of the starry sky behind the silhouettes of the cactus."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Pet a llama."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Stay in a small mountain pueblo."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Take a private tour with an english-speaking guide.
