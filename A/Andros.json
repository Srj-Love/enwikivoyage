It is second in size after Naxos and is located between Euboia - which it is separated by the Cavo D'Oro (Cape Caphereus) - and Tinos island.  It is a mountainous island, blessed with  verdant slopes full of citrus and olivetrees, waterfalls, mountain streams and numerous high quality water springs.\n\nAccording to the Greek mythology the island got it's name from the first settler Andros, a hero of Olympic gods descent.  Other names were also used in the course of history: Hydroussa, Nonagria and Lasia, all homage to the rich flora and water springs found on Andros.  It was during the Classical Age that Andros showed first signs of flourishing civilization with its capital at the site of present day Paleopolis.  The favored god was Dionysios with a great celebration in his honor where \"water was turn to wine\" taking place every third year the first ten days of January.  In 133 BC Andros is taken by the Roman Empire and in 1270 passes to Venice and sees the construction of forts and towers, the Lower For in Chora being the most important and the Upper Fort in Kohilou. This period sees about 5 centuries of economic growth as it becomes an important centre of silk textile trade industry.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["By sea"]},"\nFrom the Greek mainland ferries and hydrofoil services run daily from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rafina"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lavrio"]]},".
