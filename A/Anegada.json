[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Anegada banner Loblolly and Salt Ponds.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Anegada"]}," is an island in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["British Virgin Islands"]]},". It has a year round population of less than 200 on 15 square miles (38 sq km), which makes it the second largest island in the chain, after ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tortola"]]},", but the most sparsely populated of the main islands. It is also geographically isolated, being separated by some 15 miles of blue water from the rest of the chain.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Anegada west end.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Palm tree at the island's west end"]]},"\n\nIn order to get to Anegada, you will have to fly to either ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Juan"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Puerto Rico"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saint Thomas"]]},", and then to Beef Island Airport on ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tortola"]]},". From there you can take the ferry to Anegada which runs Monday, Wednesday and Friday at specific times, normally morning and afternoon, or you can take a chartered flight to Anegada via a number of airlines. Island Birds and Fly BVI are some of these.\n\nPeople with their own yachts and boats also often sail to the island, but careful attention is necessary as the island is surrounded on all sides by reefs. Anegada, being a low coral atoll some miles away from the main island chain, is not actually visible from your likely starting point, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Virgin Gorda"]]}," (although the reverse is not true -- you can see ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Virgin Gorda"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tortola"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jost Van Dyke"]]}," just fine once you're there.) Because of the reefs, the distance, and the low profile, simple line of sight navigation is not possible, making a boat trip to Anegada more of an adventure than sailing to the other BVIs. There is far less boat traffic, and for that matter far fewer people total, than on the other large islands.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nJeeps and trucks are available for rent on the island.
