The city and its surrounding area are noted for its huge reclining Buddha, courageous heroes, court dolls, wickerwork, drum-making, and double-reclining Buddha.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nAng Thong, originally known as Wiset Chai Chan, is on the Noi River and the low-lying land of Chao Phraya River. It was a frontier outpost of Ayutthaya when fighting with the Burmese. It appears in several parts of the Ayutthaya chronicles, especially prior to the defeat of Ayutthaya in 1767. Later during the Thonburi era, Wiset Chai Chan was moved to a new site on the left bank of the Chao Phraya River at Ban Bangkaeo and was named \"Ang Thong\" since its location was a fertile basin similar to a water and rice bowl of the country.\n\nAng Thong is a small province of 968 square kilometres at the lower part of central Thailand. Topographically, almost all of the Ang Thong area is low plain with two important rivers crossing the province, i.e., the Noi River and Chao Phraya River. Ang Thong is administratively divided into 7 districts: Mueang Ang Thong, Wiset Chai Chan, Sawaeng Ha, Pa Mok, Pho Thong, Chaiyo, and Samko. Borders are Singburi to the north, Ayutthaya to the south, Ayutthaya and Lopburi to the east and Suphanburi to the west.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By car "]},"\nThree options from Bangkok are:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Take the Phahonyothin Highway (Hwy 32) from Bangkok and turn onto the Asian Hwy, passing Bang Pa-in, Bang Pahan in Ayuttaya and then Ang Thong.
