The city is rich in history and heritage, with old and historical significant buildings dotting its landscape, but these days it is best known for its high concentration of casinos and sometimes questionable nightlife (though that's changing; see \"Drink\" below). Aside from these, it is also famous for its extreme sports adventures in the lahar flows of Mt. Pinatubo.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Mapframe"],["15.1646"],["120.5854"],["zoom=16"],["height=470"],["width=470"],["layer=OP"]]},"\nAngeles is a thriving regional city partly due to its long history of western influence originating from the fact that its Clark Freeport Zone was formerly the massive American Clark Airbase (previously named Fort Stotsenberg) from 1898 until 1991. In 1899, it became the seat of the Philippine government under General Emilio Aguinaldo and the site of the first anniversary celebration of Philippine Independence. After World War II, it had the highest concentration of American expatriates as well as Filipino mestizos, some of whom chose to permanently settle here. Today Angeles is known for its booming nightlife and is becoming increasingly popular as a tourist destination, particularly from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South Korea"]]},". Its center, Balibago, is especially known for its fine restaurants, hotels and shopping malls. Within Balibago is the neon-lit Fields Avenue, known for its bars, nightclubs and what could be one of the world's largest concentration of go-go bars. Adjoining Clark Freeport Zone is the site of world-class resorts, casinos, duty-free shops and beautifully landscaped golf courses. The city, and the rest of the Pampanga region, is known as the culinary center of the Philippines.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nAngeles is served by the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Diosdado Macapagal International Airport"]}," (DMIA) in Clark Freeport Zone, approximately 5 kilometers from the city proper. It has adequate travel facilities such as currency exchange, duty free shopping center, souvenir shops, free wireless internet, a tourist information center, hotel and travel agency representatives, and car rental services.  The airport is where budget airlines like Tiger Airways Singapore fly to and from Singapore, Tiger airways Philippines Bangkok, Hongkong, Kalibo, and Cebu Pacific from Singapore, Hong kong, Macau, Cebu city.  It also receives direct flights from Hong Kong and South Korea from carriers such as Asiana Airlines, Domestic flights are offered by Cebu Pacific and (Tiger Airways Philippines now part of Cebu Pacific airlines).\n\n[",{"type":"'''","value":["Special note"]},", July 2012:  Proof of onward travel absolutely required to get into this airport when using Cebu Pacific.  In other words, have a ticket onward or to elsewhere before attempting to check in your luggage or you will not be permitted to continue your journey.]\n\nBecause DMIA is a small airport, containing only one terminal, it is often considered a more efficient gateway into the Philippines than through heavily-congested Manila.  The roadways around the airport are fairly rural, making transport between the airport and the city quick and hassle-free.  Don't worry about finding transport as taxi drivers will heavily solicit you for patronage as you exit the airport.  \nHowever, the taxi fares are steep compared to other modes of transportation.  for example, the fare from the airport to Fields will cost P500 for just a 15 minute ride in a taxi.  If alone, it is best to find a fellow traveler to share a taxi or walk to the Main road going passed the airport and take a Jeepeny for Just p12.\n\nWhen going back to the airport from the Fields Ave during the daytime, jeepneys parked near the Clark AFB entrance  are also an option.  They're often not going to the airport itself, and normally wait until the jeepney is full - but by paying the higher price (P200 if you charter an empty one, less if you just want the driver to make a short detour to the airport) these inconveniences are resolved easily and cheaper than by hiring a taxi.\n\nTo get to the airport from Dau Bus Terminal the \"cheap way\": take a jeepney to \"main gate\" (P8). At \"main gate\" ask for the jeepneys to the airport. These drop you at the entrance of the airport parking (P12). You must then walk less than 5 minutes to the terminal building. Count 15–30 minutes in total.\nAt maingate, some jeepney drivers will also offer to bring you to the terminal building for about P250, just insist that you want to go the cheap way.\nI am pretty sure that there are jeepneys from angeles (Fields Ave) to dau main gate (to be confirmed)\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Beware that there is a P450 fee when leaving from this airport "]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nThis is the most common and economical way to get to Angeles from Metro Manila. Several air-conditioned bus lines ply from Manila to Angeles route with terminals scattered across the metropolitan area. It normally takes one-and-a-half hours to get to Angeles by bus.  However, travellers are well advised to consider the unpredictable effect heavy traffic and downpours will have on the commute.  In short, give yourself plenty of time to travel by bus.  Provincial bus companies have scheduled trips from Manila to provinces to northern provinces and key cities.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nThe best way from Manila to Angeles via car is taking the North Luzon Expressway which extends until Sta. Ines in Mabalacat, Pampanga. You may take either the Angeles Exit or Dau exit to get there. Another motorway, though narrow, is the McArthur Highway and visitors need to pass through the province of Bulacan to get to Angeles on both routes. It usually takes about 45 minutes to travel but it is twice the travel time if you plan to take the McArthur route due to heavy traffic along its stretch. Rental car companies can be found all over Manila and Angeles. If you don't know the routes, you can hire drivers by asking the attendant of the rent-a-car shop.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By jeepney"]},"\nTo hop on a colorful jeepney (small bus) is certainly the most affordable way to get around downtown.

They are restricted to low-speed roads and not permitted to enter the area surrounding the airport.  Passengers of larger physical stature may find riding in them uncomfortable.  Nevertheless, because of their slower speeds, trikes are generally a safe mode of transport. Groups of two can take a trike if one is comfortable riding behind the driver in the style of a moto-taxi.\n\nFares are negotiable, but in general 100 pesos will be a common request for all but the shortest or longest trips.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Fort Stotsenburg"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Old Pamintuan Residence"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Founders' Residence (Bale Matua)"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Post Office Building (Deposito)"]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Camalig"]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Holy Rosary Church (Santo Rosario Church)"]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Holy Family Academy Building"]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Museo ning Angeles"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bale Herencia,"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Juan D.

Another option is to accept tricycle driver's \"cheap hotel\" tout - but, as everywhere, this may mean overpricing due to the driver's commission, more concerns about hotel security, and a P50 or more for a trike ride every time you go in and out (or a long walk, which may be not safe in the night time also).\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Hotel V"],["url=http:\/\/hotelv.com.ph\/"],["email="],["address=Block 1,4,5,6 Lot-1 Mac Arthur Highway, Balibago"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=(+6345) 625 5642"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=From PHP 1,300.00"],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=Well-maintained rooms, all equipped with Air-conditioning, Flat-screen cable TV and Private toilet and bath.

You will have no trouble finding cheap and fast internet access. Usual rate ranges between PhP15 and PhP30 an hour. You will also find cheap gaming stations aside from internet access.\n\nPrepaid SIM cards of local GSM operators (Globe, Smart, Sun) are widely available and cheap (P50-100). International calls, however, are not particularly cheap (though still much cheaper than roaming rates) and usually cost around US$0.40 per minute ($0.30 for Sun, but at the expense of network coverage quality). However, often they have promotions with lower call\/SMS rates to the chosen countries - just ask the dealer about that.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay Safe"]},"\n\nThe tourist and entertainment areas are generally safe as it is filled with pedestrians and police around-the-clock.  If you're male, you will likely get heavily solicited by street vendors pitching cigarettes and trike rides.  However, they are usually nothing more than minor nuisances.  They aren't persistent as long as you show disinterest.  It’s the same with the begging population, which is small but visible.\n\nHowever, venturing into the Clark Perimeter bar areas (around the ABC Hotel) after dark is not recommended or along Santos Street south of Wild Orchid Resort.  The rule of thumb is, if it's not well-lit and populated at night, don't go there.\n\nFurthermore, be extremely vigilant of street strangers pretending to know you.  These scammers, often middle-aged male trike drivers, usually target solo tourists.  With an extended hand, they would say something like \"Hi, my friend, I met you at the hotel last night\" or \"Hey, remember me?  I was your driver.\"   Their initial goal is simply to get you talking and drawing down your guard.  But their ultimate goal is to transport you to an illegal gambling den, brothel, or to set you up for theft or mugging.  They will try to entice you by offering a free ride or to show you a new or secret bar.  Ignoring random street strangers is essential advice.  It's best not to confront them but to walk past saying \"sorry, I'm late!\"   And definitely never go anywhere with them or show your wallet.  Filipinos are known for their hospitality, but they're not that friendly to the point where they'd appear out of nowhere just to befriend you!\n\nLastly, do not engage with street prostitutes, some of whom are underaged or have criminal intent.  There are countless stories of male patrons bringing a street prostitute to his hotel room only to be startled minutes later by police knocking on the door.  The girl may claim rape and the police may demand a bribe to \"settle\" matters.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nExplore the Philippines and more of Angeles City.
