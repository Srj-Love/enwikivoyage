June to October is the rainy season, and outlying temples and the roads leading to them can turn into quagmires of mud.

Both 3-day and 7-day options require a photo to be taken which printed on your Angkor pass. If you do have a guide or driver you do not need to buy a pass for them as they most certainly will be Cambodian and can enter for free. Passes issued after 17:00 each day can be used to enter the park without counting as use of a day on your pass. However the sale of Angkor passes end at 17:30, so don't be late!.\n\nMake sure you purchase your Angkor Pass only at the official APSARA ticket sales booths located the entrance checkpoints on the way to the park. Passes cannot be purchased from any other source, including tour operators. If entering the park on the road from the airport (east checkpoint) or Banteay Srei (north checkpoint) take note that only 1-day passes are available. If entering from Siem Reap to the south this will not be an issue as all pass options are available at the southern park entrance. Also note that Angkor passes are non-transferable, so do not purchase one second-hand off someone else.

While all drivers are familiar with the area and happy to suggest good routes, most speak little English and are not actual tour guides.  For an actual licensed tour guide, the charge varies from USD45 per day to USD50 for a driver and English speaking guide. It is customary for the drivers to ask for USD5-10 extra for trips to further temples such as the those of the Big Circuit, Banteay Srey and more for remote sites like Beng Mealea.\n\nCirca January 2011, the taxi rides purchased from the airport booth to downtown Siem Reap (USD7 fixed price) include fliers advertising cars and drivers for Angkor Wat at USD30\/day.

Again, drivers might ask for more to visit remote ruins. Some drivers can speak a bit of English, and can give you information about Angkor and Cambodian life. Drivers are required to be licensed and must wear their gray numbered vest while travelling within the confines of the Angkor park. The rental of motorbikes without a driver to foreigners in Siem Reap is prohibited; however foreigners can ride motorbikes they've rented elsewhere (e.g., Phnom Penh).\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Tuk-tuks"]}," can be arranged through guesthouses, offering space for one or two travellers.

Renting a bike in Siem Reap is easy and cheap (USD1 per day, in most of places you don't even have to leave passport, locks for bikes are provided, check the bike before and ask for some amendments if needed, e.g. pumping air, oiling the chain). It is about 6 km from the city to Angkor Wat (if you go first time, make sure you go by the Visitors Centre which is the only place where you can buy passes). In the little circuit most places are at most 15 minutes away from each other by bike, so it is actually not a problem for a regular tourist (without much biking experience) to visit Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom and spots on the little circuit in one day. If you are willing to get up early and start your trip at 06ː00 (it is not uncommon to see a bike rentals open from 04ː30) it won't be a problem to visit all above plus the big circuit (where spots are 30 minutes away each other by bike) in one day. Take into account your shape and visiting preferences. If you bike a lot at home - you can easily get around much quicker. If you enjoy Khmer architecture more than the typical Angkor visitor, it is recommended you reserve at least 3 days for the trip (it doesn't matter if you go by tuk-tuk or by bike). It is a good idea to take a lot of water with you (rent a bike with a basket!), but not a big problem if you run out of it during your trip. Around every temple in Angkor park you can buy some food and drinks (it's just more expensive than in the city, about USD2 per big bottle of water in the park). Cycling in Angkor Park is safe (traffic is low), pleasant (nice views and a lot of trees providing shadows in sunny days) and, last but not least, it saves you a lot of hassle of dealing with tuk-tuk drivers.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Horse carriages"]}," and even ",{"type":"'''","value":["elephants"]}," are also available within the park, but only from specific points.

Particularly if you are interested in the carvings on the walls and towers, the book will keep you occupied for hours. If you don't want to pay money to hear a local tell you about the temples in broken English this is a good option. Authored by Michael Freeman and Claude Jacques, the cover price is USD27.95 at bookstores. Brand new copies are amazingly sold by vendors for just USD7, but the price drops to USD1 by the end of the day, even in peak season. Highly recommended.\n\nBe sure and get to the temples ",{"type":"'''","value":["early"]},". You can enter the park beginning at 05:00; the temples open at sunrise. There are fewer visitors early in the morning, and the sun isn't at full force. Arriving at the temples at 08:00 instead of 09:00 can make all the difference in staying one step ahead of the crowds.\n\nThe temples can broadly be categorized into four groups:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom"]},", the grandest temple of all and the ancient capital next to it"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Little Circuit"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["Le Petit Circuit"]},"), taking in major sites to the east of Angkor Thom"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Big Circuit"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["Le Grand Circuit"]},"), taking in major sites north and further east"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Roluos group"]},", 15 km east of Siem Reap along National Hwy 6"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Outlying temples"]},", over 20 km from Angkor Wat"]},"\nYou can, of course, mix and match freely, but as distances are fairly long, it makes sense to plan ahead and pick sites connected by road.

Scholars believe that the architecture and sculptures are that of a temple where Lord Vishnu was worshipped but it was also built as a mausoleum for the king after his death.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["How to explore"]},"\nDo your homework first. To enjoy the ruins, read articles on the sites, not just the history but also the spatial relationships and the hierarchy of importance of the ruins.

The following is one of the suggested plan to explore Angkor Wat. Enter through the west entrance. When you reach the entry tower, walk to the right to get a glimpse of all the five towering gopuras.\n\nPassing the tower and the libraries on both sides of the walkway, climb down the steps towards the left side and get to the water basin. You can catch a glimpse of the temple and its reflection in the water. Go past the basin and reach the left end of the temple.\n\nYou would by now have reached the starting point of the famous bas reliefs depicting scenes from various mythological stories and historic events. Walking from left to right you will come across scenes from battle of Ramayana, battle of Mahabharata, army of Suryavarman II, scenes from judgement by Yama (the supreme judge), churning of ocean by demons and gods to get Amrita — the nectar of immortality, Vishnu's victory over demons, victory of Krishna over Bana and other scenes of battle between gods and demons.\n\nClimb the steps to reach the second tier. One can reach the third tier and the central courtyard within by climbing the steps oriented towards any of the four cardinal points. However, it is suggested that the steps on the south (right) be taken, as these have now been fitted with a handrail — particularly useful when descending.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["When to visit"]},"\nThe sight of the grand monument towering over the landscape is breath-taking at any time of day. However, to maximise the effect it is suggested that the first trip to Angkor Wat be made in optimal lighting conditions, usually around 13:00-14:00. Sunrise at Angkor Wat is an also great sight to witness. Hence most of the tourists tend to see the sunrise at Angkor Wat, then explore other ruins in the morning and then return to Angkor Wat later in the afternoon. The sun rises behind Angkor Wat and the best colors are seen just before the sun climbs into view. As the position of the sun as it rises varies according to the time of year, do position yourself accordingly. For example, in November–December when you are facing Angkor Wat, the sun rises on your right hand side. Hence grab a place to the extreme left of the entry tower to see the sunrise. Sunset at Angkor Wat is best viewed either on the top tier or outside the main temple structure.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Angkor Thom"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Bayon"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Bayon04.png"],["thumb"],["240px"],["Plan of the Bayon"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"=====","value":["History"]},"\nBuilt in the latter part of the 12th century by King Jayavarman VII, Bayon is one of the most widely recognised temples in Siem Reap because of the giant stone faces that adorn the towers of Bayon.

Though you may want to cast a wary eye toward custodians bearing ",{"type":"''","value":["Äspara Authority"]}," armbands and local kids following you in an attempt to extract ",{"type":"''","value":["guide fees"]},", there are, in contrast to other temple sites, almost no vendors here."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Phnom Krom"]},", 12 km southwest of Siem Reap. This hilltop temple was built at the end of the 9th century, during the reign of King Yasovarman. The gloomy atmosphere of the temple and the view over the Tonle Sap lake make the climb to the hill worth while. A visit to the site can be conveniently combined with a boat trip to the lake. Obviously, the Angkor passport is needed to enter the temple so do not forget to bring your passport along when heading to Tonle Sap."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nSouvenirs are also sold in front of all temples.  Bargain, but not too hard: many souvenir sellers live within the park and, being banned from farming on their own land, have to resort to this to make a living.  Please do not encourage children who pester tourists in the temples themselves to give money or buy postcards.  Spread your tourism dollars around—most temples have the same offerings, so buy your souvenirs and gifts for friends back home from several shops, from several temples if possible, especially the less-visited ones.\n\nThere are several decent souvenir shops around the old market. The one of the shops called \"Black Garuda\" has some original key holders and mobile straps and they donate some of your purchase to land mine victims.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nDespite a ban on development and commercial activity, dozens of small noodle and snack shops have sprung up near the major attractions of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Angkor Wat"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Angkor Thom"]},". Some shopkeepers may be willing to bargain. During summer low season, you can bring the price of a good lunch down to as low as USD1 for a dish and USD0.50 for a drink. Their flocks of five year old emissaries aren't likely to hold price-cutting authority. However, avoid hard or aggressive bargaining, either because the odd dollar is nothing to you but can be significant to a local, and also it is unwise to offend or upset anybody before they prepare your meal! You'll also find some local people selling fresh pineapples and mangoes (beautifully cut) for about USD1 a piece. Also try the seasonal toddy palm fruit, a hollow sack as soft as jelly at 4 pieces for USD1 sold at the roadside to Bantay Samre and at temple refreshment stalls.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The modern ",{"type":"'''","value":["Angkor Cafe"]}," lies just outside Angkor Wat's main entrance, and also doubles as a crafts shop, with fine works from the Artisans d'Angkor shop, where they train locals in the arts.

It is a favourite among expatriates and by many rated as the best restaurant in Siem Reap. Food prices are a bit higher than the cheapest places, USD8–15, but the standard is also much higher. Excellent place for lunch and or a coffee\/wine break. Or for a romantic dinner. The owner Mathieu, a French UNESCO photographer who came to Cambodia in 1998 is charming, and the only foreigner living within the temple compound."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nSoft drinks are hawked by stalls in front of practically every temple.  As you might expect, prices are inflated: USD1 for a can of soft drink or a cold 1.5 l plastic bottle of water is more or less standard, although this can easily be bargained down to half or less.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nThere are no accommodations within the park itself and camping is not permitted. Like most tourists you will find yourself staying in Siem Reap, with a multitude of options ranging from grubby little guest houses to upmarket hotels and villas. See ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Siem Reap#Sleep"],["Siem Reap"]]}," for more details on accommodation options.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nBy local regulation, motorcycle and tuk-tuk drivers must at all times wear a numbered vest when on the job, which goes a long way towards preventing hassles and scams. However, a disturbing number of rapes continue to happen, especially after dark and in the more secluded temples, so it's advised that women not travel alone.\n\nVisiting the temples, beware of ",{"type":"'''","value":["off-duty police officers,"]}," in uniform, who start walking beside you and start showing you around the temples. At this point either say that you would like to see the temples yourself, or agree on a price at the start. Several people have been charged a fee of over USD10 at the end of the temple tour and you are not going to argue with a member of the police force! The official wage for a police officer is very low, so they can easily double their salary by being tourist guides.\n\nBeware of anyone offering you incense. They will hand you the incense and then \"teach\" you a blessing. They will then ask for a donation (generally about USD10) for the monks and the upkeep of the temple. None of the funds will make it to either of these causes, so it's best just to say a quick \"No thank you\" when they try to give you the incense in the first place.\n\nTourists mulling over whether to rent a tour bike: have no fear. Parking is never a problem and not in the warden’s wildest dream that a bike parked besides an attraction will get lost or stolen, locked or not. In small temples it surely is easy to park and leave. But what about big sites such as Angkor Wat? Just do it! Bikes are parked across the west entrance and vendors will even compete for your attention to babysit your bike. During biking trip be aware of children standing by the roads in Angkor Park and raising their hands to give you high fives. Stay on a safe side and just wave your hand, as sometimes they try to take out a ring off your fingers when you give them a high five.\n\nBe prepared for vast numbers of peddlers who linger around temples. It may feel difficult or rude to ignore the constant come-ons to buy souvenirs, photocopied guidebooks, T-shirts, and assorted junk, but it can be necessary in order to enjoy your visit in semi-peace.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\nTouring the temples is a hot and sweaty job, so bring sunblock and keep yourself well hydrated.  Some of the temples, notably the uppermost level of Angkor Wat, require climbs up ",{"type":"''","value":["very"]}," steep staircases and are best avoided if you suffer from vertigo or are not fully confident of being able to keep your footing.\n\nMalaria is not endemic around the temple complex; however, it is recommended to seek medical advice before you travel as conditions may change.\n\nDon't feed or approach the monkeys who lurk around some sites: many are ill-tempered and will bite at the slightest provocation.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Respect"]},"\nSome of Angkor's sites were originally built as Hindu temples, while some were built as Buddhist temples, and yet others were converted over the years. Today, most of Angkor's major temples house at least a few Buddha statues (nearly all added later) and draw a steady stream of monks and worshippers. You may be approached for donations, but you are under no obligation to pay unless you actually choose to accept incense sticks or other offerings.\n\nBecause these are still holy spaces for Cambodians, it is best to follow the dress code of \"long trousers or skirt, and covered shoulders.\" This is the dress code that the Cambodians follow when visiting any temple or holy space. Most Khmers are non-confrontational so this rule is not strictly enforced, but wearing inappropriate clothing sends a message of disrespect. A good rule of thumb is \"Would I wear this to my own house of worship?\" If not, it may be poor etiquette to wear it to someone else's holy site. In any event, trousers  and covered shoulders provide better protection from the sun, insects, and brambles when walking around and between the sites.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Angkor Archaeological Park"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Angkor"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["13.4333"],["103.8333"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["North-western_Cambodia"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["guidepark"]]}]
