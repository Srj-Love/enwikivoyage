Consequently the Northwest Angle is the result of 18th-century ignorance of geography. In the Anglo-American Convention of 1818, the error was corrected by having the boundary run due south from the northwest point of the lake to the 49th parallel and then westward along it. When this north-south line was surveyed, it was found to intersect other bays of the lake and therefore cut off a portion of U.S. territory, now known as the Northwest Angle. \n\nThe Angle is one of only four non-island locations in the 48 contiguous states not directly connected to them by land within the country, the others being nearby ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Elm Point"]]},", Minnesota; ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Point Roberts"]]},", Washington; and the town of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alburgh"]]},", Vermont.

MB-525 East becomes Winter Road which takes you directly in to Angle Inlet.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\nOne can reach the angle without crossing the international border by crossing the Lake of the Woods. This can be done by aircraft, by boat when the lake is free of ice, or by ice road in the winter months. Since there are no automobile ferries currently operating on the lake, vehicles coming from the rest of Minnesota can only reach the Angle without crossing the border in winter. While the ice is forming in late autumn and breaking up in the spring the lake's surface cannot be safely crossed – at these times domestic access to the Angle is possible only by air.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nAngle Inlet is easily seen on foot.
