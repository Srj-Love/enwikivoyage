Recommend that you make a booking as they tend to get fairly busy and depending on the time of the year they may have two sittings at night but it’s worth it. A good range of wines and you can also take your own bottled wine with a corkage charge. The staff are friendly and the service excellent. Recommend the goats’ cheese with pear, flash fried calamari, seafood and chorizo pasta and the lamb shanks.\nPlenty of tables out the front on the deck as well as an open fireplace in side for the cold evenings.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Anglesea Backpackers"],["alt="],["url="],["email=angleseabackpacker@iprimus.com.au"],["address=40 Noble St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Noble St turns off the Great Ocean Rd south of the main shops and just south of the bridge – be careful if driving over the bridge, Noble St has a weird split at the intersection and it’s easy to go the wrong way up a one-way lane"],["phone = +61 3 5263 2664"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=A very clean and tidy small hostel with two 6-bed dorms and an ensuite room with a double and single bed.
