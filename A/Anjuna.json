It will cost you less than Rs 10 to get to Anjuna from Mapusa by local bus (sometimes crowded)...

On a daily basis which can range anywhere from ₨ 150 to ₨ 400, depending on what you hire. They may require a small deposit, but don't leave your passport, you can leave a photocopy if you are asked. Bikes are available easily, just ask the locals who own restaurants, and shacks. refrain from asking the locals who run road-side stalls or at flea markets. Also a good idea would be to ask the person at the reception at your hotel. If you're lucky, they can arrange one for you. If you do manage to get one please fill the tank to the fullest, as petrol pumps are far away from each other.\n\nBe aware that no one seems to wear helmets and the traffic can be busy especially in peek season, its not a good place to learn how to ride a scooter or motorbike. Also you should have an international drivers license to ride a bike. If you are going to go into Mapusa or Panjim find a helmet, the police will want a bribe (baksheesh) if you don't have one or an international license.\n\nThe nearest petrol pump is Near Vagator, to get there head north at Starco junction until you hit the main T junction at Vagator, turn right and head for about 2 km (1.2 mile) just past where the road merges with the main road into Chapora, the petrol pump is on your left, join the queue of waiting bikes.\n\nPetrol is also available in one liter bottles at most of the stores around Anjuna, although the price would be roughly 60% higher than from the gas station and also purity is hard to guarantee.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By local bus "]},"\nThese are very cheap and are a good way to get to other towns like Mapusa or Vagator but won't take you off the beaten track.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By motorcyle taxi "]},"\nThese are a Goan specialty, simply pay the driver and he'll take you where you want to go, probably the cheapest form of public transport after local buses.

Go early if you want to hunt for bargains, take a rest at noon and come back when it's not as hot anymore. The market offers pretty much anything of what you can think of. Haggling is expected and failing to do so means missing out on the best part.

Be sure to check Curlie's at the end of the beach, that's the place where people meet, chill or just listen to music. That said, it is a racist place that systematically racially discriminates against Indians. If you are an Indian man, try going to the upstairs area of the shack at any point of the day or during any of their parties and you will be asked to pay an entry fee. Notice then how western tourists (men\/women), however, are allowed to get in for free. After some prodding, the guy at the entrance will even admit to only charging Indians.

As many business owners complain about plunging visitor numbers, the next government (and season) might allow more parties.\n\nPlaces to find parties near Anjuna are: Dolce Vita\/Bamboo Forest (recently closed, Feb. 07), but particularly at the beach. If there's one when you're around, be sure to go to one of the famous full moon parties, or one of the less known black moon parties.\n\nYou can spot where the parties are by looking for the flickering lights of the \"chai ladies\" on the beach. They always congregate where the parties are happening, and the flames from their kerosene lamps are a great signpost.\n\nBest idea is to go to Nine Bar in Vagator and ask around.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Buy "]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Wednesday Flea Market"]},"\nOn the way to the beach by main road, you'll cross the Wednesday flea market location. The Anjuna flea market is attracting so many people from all north Goa every Wednesday that the traffic becomes a problem in south Anjuna. if you're going with a 2-wheeler you'll have to pay a few rupees for parking. Inside the market, you'll find all the shops that are on the streets the rest of the week and some more. be careful not to be fooled by the sellers who will tell you that it's not even their cost price or that they can sell it to someone else for 3 or 4 time the price you want. If you plan to open your own shop in the flea market, it will cost you ₨ 100.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Ingos Saturday Night Market "]},"\nThis one is a must go, more diversity in the shops, good quality items, food stands but also usually more crowded. Many foreigners are running business in this market (didgeridoo player selling didgeridoos,to travellers doing some business to travel more, Tibetan cooking Tibetan food to raise money for Tibetan refugees, ",{"type":"''","value":["etc"]},".). It's on the way to Arpora from Anjuna. You can also find some smaller night markets around, some are worth spending some time inside, others aren't.\n\nUnfortunately it seems that Ingos has been forced to move from its old location at Arpora to a new location on the other side of the new road bridge just north of Siolim, its yet to be seen if the new location will be successful.
