The population is around 4.5 million.\n\nAnkara is the administrative center of Turkey and a huge university town, so it has a large population of government workers and university students. As the national capital Ankara is home to a large population of foreign diplomats and embassy staff, so it offers goods and services that might be more difficult to find in other Turkish cities - for example you will have no problem ordering a cappucino or a hamburger.\n\nAnkara is a sprawling, modern city which can appear as little more than a dull, concrete jungle at first glance. As a result, many tourists tend to use it merely as a transit point for getting to places like Konya or Cappodocia. However Ankara does have a lot to offer for those prepared to look a bit deeper.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Modern cityscape of Ankara, as viewed from the path leading to Anıtkabir.jpg"],["thumb"],["Modern cityscape of Ankara, as viewed from the path leading to Anıtkabir"]]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nLike all Turks, the locals are generally friendly and helpful to tourists. Ankara has a large university student population and many young people can communicate in English. Having said that, it's still a good idea to have a Turkish phrasebook or dictionary on hand.\n\nApart from the old town in and around the citadel near Ulus, and unplanned shantytown neighbourhoods here and there built hastily by new immigrants from countryside in the last five decades, most of Ankara, which was a provincial town of 20,000 people in the early days of Republic, is a purpose-built capital due to its strategic location at the heart of the country, although the history of settlement in the vicinity is millennia old.\n\nWhile the biggest claim to fame of the town used to be the long-haired local breed of goats named after former name of the city (",{"type":"'''","value":["Angora"]},"), out of which high quality mohair textiles were produced, today the only place where you can spot them in city is the lawns on the side of a clover-leaf interchange on the highway west—in the form of cute sculptures.\n",{"type":"===","value":["Orientation"]},"\nThe \"downtown\" area of this large city is around ",{"type":"'''","value":["Kızılay Square"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["Kızılay Meydanı"]},") which has a fair number of transportation links to almost anywhere in the city.

Temperature is regularly below the freezing point during this season, but it rarely drops below -15°C. Thanks to the low levels of relative humidity, the hot and dry summers are more comfortable than coastal regions of Turkey. Summer nights are cool, though, so be sure to bring at least a cardigan with you to wear outdoors.

Many taxi drivers, even though very few of them speak a foreign language, will understand your requested destination and instructions. Tell them then to put the taximeter on.

Occasionally taxi drivers may actually also rip notes you give them, and tell you it is no good, in order to make you hand them a 50 lira note. So, make sure the notes are not ripped, and is actually the right one before you hand them over.

Around Sakarya str., there are various types of fish restaurants, from fast food to stylish ones and it can be a good opportunity to also try rakı, which is known as a companion of fish.
