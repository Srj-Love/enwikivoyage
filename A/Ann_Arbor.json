Today the city has a population of about 115,000 people, not including the transient college students, or the thousands of visitors who come to town for football games and various festivals.\n\nAnn Arbor is a picturesque city surrounding the University of Michigan. It has a strong bent toward the arts, and an attractive and pedestrian-friendly downtown.

The U of M campus intermingles with downtown, and the whole area is walkable, though day buses run between the campuses and the central business district. Toyota, General Motors, Ford, Thomson, Google, and Domino's have a major presence in the area.

(In the early 20th century, after having leveled the forest that once occupied the area, the city instituted an aggressive tree-planting program that's since borne fruit.)\n\nLike most of Michigan, summers can be hot and humid, with temperatures occasionally hitting 90 degrees, but averaging in the mid 80s. Winters are fairly normal for the lower Great Lakes region, which enjoys 4 seasons. It starts to be chilly in late October and it begins to warm up again in mid-March (but the occasional early April snowfall is not unheard of!). Average winter temperatures are generally in the range of 30°F and in January temps can dip below 20°F, or even lower if it's windy.  Summers can get quite hot; in mid-July it can hit high into the 90's with high humidity. \n\nDowntown is a solid block of restaurants and art galleries. The university hosts cultural events, and venues such as the Michigan Theater host first-run independent films and high-profile music groups. Several good independent bookshops are located here, as was the Borders flagship store until its closing in 2011, and the Ann Arbor Art Fair draws over half a million visitors each summer.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Ann Arbor Convention and Visitors Bureau"],["url=http:\/\/www.annarbor.org"],["email="],["address=120 W Huron Street"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 734 995-7281"],["tollfree=+1-800-888-9487"],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nAnn Arbor is bounded by ",{"type":"'''","value":["I-94"]}," (between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Detroit"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jackson (Michigan)"],["Jackson"]]},") on the south and west, ",{"type":"'''","value":["US-23"]}," (between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Flint"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Toledo (Ohio)"],["Toledo"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ohio"]]},") on the east, and ",{"type":"'''","value":["M-14"]}," (which leads to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Detroit"]]},"'s western suburbs and ",{"type":"'''","value":["I-96"]},") on the north.

You'll also notice hot dog and tamale carts on many street corners, particularly in the summer, selling basic fare starting at $1 with complimentary toppings.\n\nOne thing you won't see much of, however, at least on campus and in the downtown area, are popular nationwide fast-food chains. The impression is that Ann Arbor is proud enough of its small independent restaurants that it has no need for mass-produced french fries (although with rental costs rising in the downtown area, many local restaurants — and shops — are being ousted in favor of wealthier small chains, like Bruegger's and Great Wraps).\n\nFor the more refined palate, there's no shortage of fine dining. Between Ann Arbor's vibrant cultural life and its sizeable international population, there seems to be considerable demand for the fancy and the exotic. There are certainly a few restaurants in town that can empty your wallet singlehandedly, but don't let their reputations scare you away: at even the priciest restaurants, there are dishes that you can order for a more modest fee, if you just want to sample the atmosphere. During warmer weather, be sure to check out the eateries on Main Street that offer outdoor sidewalk dining. It's a popular alternative, especially for the locals who have just suffered through six months of winter, and even though you're sitting right by the street, it's more relaxing than you might expect.\n\nIf you're looking for an Ann Arbor specialty, the ",{"type":"'''","value":["fragel"]}," — a raisin bagel that has been deep-fried and rolled in cinnamon sugar — seems to have originated here.

Accommodations tend to be the most expensive in the campus area, so unless you're here for a conference or business trip that's being paid for, you'll probably want to look further out.\n\nHotels in the campus area are within easy walking distance of downtown Ann Arbor and most of the attractions. The southeastern area is served by two AATA bus lines, route 4 (along Washtenaw) and route 22 (along Carpenter), and the northwestern area is along route 9. The other two areas aren't quite as well linked, although route 2 does go along part of Plymouth Rd, and the commuter 36 stops at Wolverine Tower, which is a short walk from the hotels along State and Boardwalk. However, you'll most likely want to use your car to get around if you're staying outside of downtown. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Budget"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Americas Best Value Inn"],["url=http:\/\/www.americasbestvalueinn.com\/bestv.cfm?idp=756"],["email="],["address=3505 S State St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 734 665-3500"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=$50–$70"],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=108 rooms.

The only really common crimes in town are those that you find in any other university town. Theft is the biggie, as many university students who leave their bags unattended in the library or those who fail to lock their bikes can tell you. There's also the occasional mugging or sexual assault, but these tend to occur after dark, so if you're not wandering the streets at 2AM, you probably don't have anything to worry about. Having said that, wandering the streets at 2AM in downtown Ann Arbor is generally quite safe and not at all frightening; there are usually enough students out partying or hanging out with friends until the wee hours that you won't feel like a lone target, or like you're in a dangerous crowd.  U of M Police, Ann Arbor Police, and the Washtenaw County Sheriff patrol regularly and are not difficult to find--indeed, alcohol violations such as drinking on the street from an open container are vigorously policed.
