There are plenty of parking spaces available during less crowded times, such as during the winter months and weekdays after work hours. They are easy to find by following either the parking signs to a parking garage or looking around the harbor area for metered spots which can be held for up to two hours. Bicycles are also an option to bring along, but generally wouldn't be needed for a day of sightseeing in the harbor area.\n\nTourist maps are available at many downtown establishments, usually highlighting map sponsors as places to visit, but also including most places of interest as a not-to-scale reference. Any local Annapolitan would be more than happy to give short directions, or even a tip on where to eat.\n\nDuring the busier times, a parking place will be a bit harder to find, but patience is usually rewarded. If needing extended transport, a bus line does traverse Annapolis at various locations. Though, the Annapolis Transit buses have a tendency to run off schedule and are often extremely early or extremely late; plan extra time if using the buses.
