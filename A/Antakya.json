It is not to be confused with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Antalya"]]},", another city in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mediterranean Turkey"]]},", several hundred kilometers to the west.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThis city in the very south of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Turkey"]]}," was an important centre of early Christianity, with some of the first non-hidden churches. Today it’s a truly multicultural place, where you can hear prayers in many different tongues. Many sects of Christianity (Greek Orthodoxy, Syriac Christianity, Roman Catholicism, Protestantism to name a few) and Islam (Sunni and Alawi), as well as Judaism, are all represented with their dedicated temples in Antakya.\n\nEthnically, Arabs constitute almost half of the population whereas the other half is constituted by Turks. Arabs in the city speak Levantine (Shami) dialect of Arabic, which is also prevalent in Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan.\n\nThe city is not located on the sea-shore, but the Asi River (formerly known as the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Orontes River"]},") flows through the city center.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\nDomestic flights are available to ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hatay Airport"]},", 25 km from the city center. However, the nearest international airport is located in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Adana"]]},", a couple of hundred kilometres to the north. The 'Havas' bus runs from the airport hourly to the city centre for 9 lira, and takes around 20–30 minutes. If you need to get back to the airport, the Havas leaves from the front of the 'Buyuk Antakya Hotel' (on the river, close to the Mosaic Museum; it' a huge resort style hotel, you can't miss it) every half hour most days, but check the Havas website for specific departure times. This is a lot cheaper than a taxi! Please note that you will have to flag the Havas bus down from the front of the hotel, as not many people utilise this service, so make your presence known as it drives past.\n\nYou can also use ",{"type":"''","value":["Dolmuş Taxi"]},"s in order to get to the city center. Many dolmuş taxis wait just in front of the airport and as soon as any four customers are gathered, the taxi heads towards the city. The taxis charge approximately 10 lira per person. All in all, if you accept to share the taxi with other passengers, taking a cab is preferable to Havaş as the taxi drops you off in whichever part of the city you want to get out while Havaş only stops at specific points.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nThe nearest station is in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Iskenderun"]]},", which has several daily train connections with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Adana"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mersin"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nHas Turizm ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.hasturizm.com.tr\/h_english\/index.asp"]}," operates comfortable buses from all major cities in Turkey. There are also bus connections with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Aleppo"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Syria"]]},".\n\nThe otogar is located about 7 kilometers from the city center.  Once you arrive look for minibuses to take you within walking distance of the center.  Many of the hotels are located on Istiklal street.\n\nTo get from Antakya to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Aleppo"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Syria"]]},", the best option is to catch a bus from the central bus station (",{"type":"''","value":["otogar"]},") outside of town. It's too far to walk there, but there are bus connections from the town centre. The journey to Aleppo should cost you 10 Turkish Lira (2009). Keep in mind that the last bus (during Ramadan) leaves at 11AM! This might be different outside of Ramadan, though. You can also try to catch a taxi from the town centre, which can be fairly difficult, as you normally have to wait until there are enough people sharing the taxi. The journey should cost you around 25 Turkish Lira each if the taxi gets full. If you don't want to wait, you can pay for the whole taxi and depart immediately, which is going to be about 100-120 Turkish Lira.\n\nDon't try to cross the border step by step! The Lonely Planet mentions this option, which means you catch a bus to the Turkish border control, hitchhike to the Syrian border (which is about 5 km away, and you are not allowed to walk) and then take a taxi from there to Aleppo. You should be prepared for an extremely time-consuming trip. There's no other possibility to get from the Turkish border control to the Syrian one than waiting for a car to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tips for hitchhiking"],["hitchhike"]]},". This can take some hours. At the Syrian border neither buses nor taxis are to be found, so you will have to hitchhike again. Most people will charge you for hitchhiking, and normally they will try to rip you off. Speaking Turkish and\/or Arabic will certainly help, but if you don't, this trip is going to be really difficult. Apart from that it's more expensive than the direct bus.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mosaic Museum"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["Mozaik Müzesi"]},") or the Antakya Archeological Museum in the city has the second largest collection of classical\/Roman mosaics ",{"type":"'''","value":["in the world"]},".
