Arrival at the Ivato Airport in Tana is fairly scary for those used to US or European airports.  First, you need to buy a visa using Euros or US dollars, and dealing with immigration folks, wherever they are, is always stressful.  Once you get past baggage claim, the fun really starts as you are descended upon by a mass of \"entrepreneurs\" offering assistance with your luggage to the waiting taxis, in return for a gratuity of course.  This may be helpful to some, but others may find the presence of the \"Skycaps a la Tana\" a little distracting as they try to change money at the airport bank (which you have to do, since the Madagascar Ariary is not a convertible currency).\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Taxi Tana.jpg"],["thumbnail"],["Taxi Tana"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nThere are three main methods of navigating the capital: taxi, bus and on foot.  Most tourists tend to use taxis as they are very practical. Make sure you agree the rate with the driver before entering the taxi.  Also, be aware that traffic tends to be heavy in Analakely (Antananrivo's center and busiest area) during typical rush hour times.  If you are comfortable being squeezed onto a van with other people, the buses, or 'taxi be', are the most affordable form of transportation, with prices usually ranging from 1,000 fmg to 2,000 fmg (Compared to 25,000 fmg or more for a typical taxi ride).  However, tourists are not usually familiar with taxi be routes.  While the city is quite large, Analakely is fairly navigable on foot.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Leaving Tana"]},"\n\nTo travel on from Tana there is only one real form of public transport, the taxi brousse or bush taxi. These link up the capital to most other towns and depart from four major bus stations, which roughly correspond to the points of the compass; i.e. the northern bus station includes destinations such as Nosy Be and Antsiranana (Diego-Suarez), while the Eastern one (Gare Routiere de l'est) has destinations such as Andasibe. If you don't know which one you need ask a taxi driver to take you to the right one for your location.\n\nOn arrival to the station you will be mobbed by touts trying to sell the services of every destination and route, don't be intimidated they do this to all arrivals to the station, local and tourist alike. Most stations are lined with ticket kioks with signs overhead advertising their locations. On the wall inside there should be a price list advertising locations, so make sure you don't pay more than this (and remember luggage is included). You can also ask to be dropped off on route before the final destination. Another thing to note that after buying your ticket the bus may not leave until hours after the quoted leaving time, as they will only leave when full. Try and avoid the back row of seating, this generally has the least leg room.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Northern bus station"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Destinations include Antsiranana\/Diego-Suarez (for Ankarana), Ambanja (for Nosy Be), Mahajanga (for Ankarafantsika) and Antsohihy among others.

For Ankarana National Park catch a bush-taxi with a destination of Antsiranana and ask to get dropped off by the park entrance. This involves a very painful 20 hour journey (~65,000 ariary in January 2012). You will likely stop over in Ambanja for half an hour (~14 hours into the journey).

Don't worry if you get dropped off in the village in the middle of the night, at least one hotel, (Palmeria) has a night guard who can sort out a room for you.

Restaurants and shops line both sides of the road and it's the place to go if you want to visit a restaurant or decent cafe, including a good pizzeria and a take-away pizza restaurant. There are also internet cafes and photo-printing facilities. Shops for the Maki and Baobab clothing brand shops can be found a few streets away. The main attraction for this area is the large central market, which includes a covered section selling bags, jewellery and clothing at relatively cheap prices (remember to haggle). Outside there's a plethora of fruit, vegetable and spice stalls, where large packs of vanilla pods can be bought for just a couple of thousand ariary (January 2012).\n\nOutside the centre there is a dedicated tourist market which has about 30 stalls selling souvenirs and local crafts. Definitely worth a visit, due to the decline in tourists since the 2009 coup the place will likely be dead, and some bargains can be picked up. \n \nThere are many large western style supermarkets notable the chain 'Jumboscore', any taxi driver can take you here. However, most stock is imported from abroad and so include a significant mark up (although most goods are still below European prices). For fresh goods like fruit and vegetables, significant savings can be made by buying them from the local markets stalls dotted throughout the city.\n\nBuy a local SIM (Telma, Orange etc.) to access calls at the national rate. Both Sim cards and credit are easily obtainable throughout the country, and one of the few things you can easily get hold of (aside from Coca cola, THB beer and coconut flavoured biscuits) in provincial towns and small rural villages. As with most countries, the cheapest way to receive calls from abroad is to use a local SIM and get someone to ring the number using Skype (or similar software), as it will be free for you (the receiver) and cheap for them.\n\nMost banks have an ATM, although they often limit you to how much you can draw out at once. It's relatively simple to change money from euros and dollars to ariary, and you often get a better rate than at the airport. Some banks will also accept pound sterling.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=La Table de Mariette"],["url="],["email="],["address=11 rue George-V-Faravohitra"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+ 261 20 22 216 02"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]},"This is a good choice for high quality Malagasy food.
