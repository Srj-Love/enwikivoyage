Under the provisions of the treaty, international access to the territory is permitted.\n\nThis region of Antarctica is anything but a wasteland. Many animal species call this area home and concentrate in the short Antarctic summer to reproduce; it is here that you will find huge colonies of penguins. Wildlife that can be seen include Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo, and Emperor Penguins; Humpback, Minke, Blue, and Orca Whales; Crab-eater, Weddell, and Leopard Seals; Blue-eyed Shag, Southern Giant Petrel, Cape Petrel, Kelp Gull; and more.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:8932-paradise-harbour-zodiac.JPG"],["thumb"],["280px"],["Zodiac cruising in Paradise Harbour"]]},"\n\nThere are no airstrips along the Peninsula, so the only access to the island is by boat. Most tourists arrive on ships with an ice-strengthened hull. There are many islands scattered along the west side of the Peninsula, several of which are occupied by scientific research bases organized by different countries. \n\nCompanies that can help to arrange travel to the Antarctic Peninsula include:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cheesemans' Ecology Safaris"]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/cheesemans.com\/"]},".

This special extended itinerary explores the remote and iceberg-filled Weddell Sea, the many wildlife-rich islands in the northern and western Peninsula and South Shetland Islands, the great white continent itself, and a push south to the Antarctic Circle. They charter an entire ship that is the best fit for the expedition and always take less than 100 people so all can land at once to provide more time ashore."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nMany different itineraries are offered by tour companies, from short 7-day to extended 20-day voyages. The longer itineraries offer more landings and can travel farther south than shorter versions; they are also more flexible and can adjust landings if weather and conditions become an issue. \n\nTours usually start in Ushuaia at the very tip of South America then sail for about two days across the Drake Passage to the Antarctic Peninsula. The west side of the peninsula is navigable since it is relatively ice-free during the Antarctic summer tourist season. Many islands are scattered along the coast here providing many landing sites for visitors. Huge penguin colonies are usually found in ice-free areas such as on Paulet, Deception, and Livingston Islands. Zodiac cruising is popular along the peninsula where landing is either not permitted or not possible, providing a great way to see whales, seals and penguins on ice floes. Landings on the Antarctic continent itself can be accomplished in several areas such as Almirante Brown, Neko Harbor, and Brown Bluff.\n\nTourism in Antarctica is strictly regulated to protect its fragile and pristine environment. The Antarctic Treaty provides strict guidelines to reduce tourism impacts. Private tour companies formed the International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators (",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.iaato.org\/ IAATO"]},") in 1991 to promote responsible tourism in the Antarctic regions. Tour itineraries must be approved by and registered with IAATO.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\nTwo of the southernmost ",{"type":"'''","value":["postoffices"]}," in the world are located in the region, from which you can send mail with a true \"Antarctica\" postmarkâ€”and these are (relatively speaking) the most accessible ones where you can do so, given the difficulty of getting to US Post Office at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South Pole"]]},".
