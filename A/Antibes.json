Shortly afterwards it was incorporated into the expanding Roman empire when it was known as Antiboul. With the fall of the Roman empire Antibes was a target of pirates and raiders until the growing power of Genoa removed most of these menaces. \n\nAround the 11th century AD Antibes was a feudal town whose eventual overlord was the Pope. In 1384 it passed into the hands of the Grimaldi family - the former Genovese merchant princes who had now moved westwards to Monaco and Nice - as collateral to a loan that the Pope could not repay. Shortly after this Antibes became the easternmost port of the kingdom of France - at that time Nice was part of Savoy - and thus was extremely important. Over the years, and particularly during the 100 years war, it's port was continually fortified and expanded, culminating in the Fort Carré and the Port Vauban finished in 1710. \n\nThe first tourists arrived at Cap d’Antibes in the 1880s and the adjacent town of Juan les Pins was built at the end of the 19th century. Although it expanded, during the early 20th cetury Antibes was less developed than its neighbors on the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["French Riviera"]]}," and was thus a haven for artists such as Picasso and later Nicolas de Staël. This under-development did not last and as the 20th century drew to a close the combined municipality of Antibes-Juan-les-Pins was just a part of the unbroken development between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nice"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cannes"]]},".\n",{"type":"===","value":["Information"]},"\n\nThere are three tourist information offices in Antibes-Juan les Pins: \n\n1) 11, place du Général de Gaulle (Antibes)\n2) 51, boulevard Charles Guillaumont (Juan les Pins)\n3) In the old town near the remparts.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nBoth Antibes and Juan les Pins have train stations on the main ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nice"]]},"-",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cannes"]]}," line.\n\nThe usual method of driving to Antibes is to take the A8 and exit at the Antibes exit (junction 44) and then taking the winding road down to Antibes. It is possible to approach Antibes along the coastal roads (RN98 and RN7) from Cannes and Nice\/",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cagnes sur Mer"]]},". In summer all these coastal roads can be extremely congested as can the main route from the A8. There are, however, very few alternative methods of access and all of them eventually use one of these roads so if you want to go to Antibes then you pretty much have to expect traffic jams.\n\nThere is a regular bus service (no 200) between Cannes, Antibes and Nice from Place Charles de Gaulle.

Coffee from coffee machines (35-50 centimes) is actually pretty decent, and good in a pinch.\n\nAntibes can be a difficult place for vegetarian or vegan travellers. Vegetarians should not have much trouble but vegans can expect ending up with a bland and expensive salad. Servers tend to not be very accommodating and are often visibly insulted if asked to modify a dish. There is hope, however. There is a 'falafel place' in the old town near the covered market with vegan options. There is also Chez Helen's, a vegetarian restaurant with vegan options in the old town. There are also a few Indian restaurants in the old town and, in Juan les Pins, a number of Asian restaurants.\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=La Passagere"],["url=http:\/\/www.la-passagere.com\/"],["email="],["address=33, boulevard Baudoin"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+33 4 93 61 02 79"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=€29-120"],["content=Gourmet Restaurant.

Absinthe, the mysterious green liqueur so much associated with 19th century artists and writers such as Van Gogh and Baudelaire, was outlawed for decades because of the health risks associated with its abuse, namely insanity and death. However these side effects seem to have been due to \"quality control\" issues and the herbs that go into absinthe are in fact good for you. Absinthe was only reintroduced legally again in about 2003, and there are very few places where it is possible to drink it. The bar is set in the basement of the Olive Oil shop by the covered market (Marché Provençal) of Antibes and is full of charm even without the lure of Absinthe. If there is a group of you the host will normally give each member of the group a slightly different absinthe so that you can try the different varieties. It is quite an experience and will set you back a mere €4 for a glass. Given the price of beer in the touristy bars by the port this is a real bargain. On Friday nights there is a piano man. The Absinthe bar also provides you with dozens of silly hats (yes, hats), which everyone wears and trades as the evening goes on.\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["drink"],["name=Bar Fitzgerald at the Hotel Belles Rives"],["url=http:\/\/www.bellesrives.com\/"],["email="],["address=33, boulevard Baudoin"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+33 4 93 61 02 79"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=The Bar Fitzgerald is part of the much closed circle of Cafés Historiques et Patrimoniaux d'Europe with one of the most popular terraces of the Riviera over the bay of Juan-les-Pins."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Hotel Belles Rives"],["url=http:\/\/www.bellesrives.com\/"],["email="],["address=33 boulevard Baudoin"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+33 4 93 61 02 79"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=€140-2000"],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=Off the mythical road to Cap d'Antibes, a breathtaking art-deco palace sits on the water’s edge overlooking the sparkling Mediterranean with outstanding sea views.
