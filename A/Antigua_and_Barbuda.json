With few other natural resources, tourism dominates the local economy of both islands. Stunning white sand beaches abound, and on Antigua there is no shortage of attendant high-end resorts.  Barbuda still has the beaches but little tourism-based infrastructure.\n\nInvestment banking and financial services also make up an important part of the economy with many major foreign banks taking advantage of the nation's liberal banking laws. That may all change though after the 2009 arrest of Antigua-based   Texan billionaire Allen Stanford who is accused of perpetrating an enormous fraud which may have bilked investors of some US$8 billion.\n\nCricket is a huge sport here and this tiny nation has produced several genuine all-time world greats of the game.  Cricket fans will certainly not be short of locals to chat with.\n\nAntigua and Barbuda are nicknamed \"Land of 365 beaches\" due to the beaches that surround the two islands.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nThe Siboney were the first to inhabit the islands of Antigua and Barbuda in 2400 B.C., but Arawak and Carib Indians populated the islands when Columbus landed on his second voyage in 1493. Early settlements by the Spanish and French were succeeded by the English who formed a colony in 1667. Slavery, established to run the sugar plantations on Antigua, was abolished in 1834. The islands became an independent state within the British Commonwealth of Nations in 1981.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nThe climate is tropical marine with little seasonal temperature variation. The islands experience hurricanes and tropical storms (July to October), and periodic droughts.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Electricity"]},"\n\nOfficially 230V 60 Hz. Most outlets are the standard British type. Generally speaking, U.S. and Canadian travellers should pack adapters for these outlets if they plan to use North American electrical equipment in Antigua & Barbuda.\nContact your hotel and ask to be sure. Many places are now built to North American standards.\n\nAlso in use are non-grounded North American outlets. These require an adapter to work with plugs that have the third grounding plug.  Older North American outlets may not be polarized (with one slot wider than the other). To remedy this, the wider vertical blade on a polarized plug may be filed down to match the width of the other. Otherwise, adapters are available which accept a polarized plug and adapt it for use with a non-polarized outlet.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Regions"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Regionlist"],["regionmap=Antigua and Barbuda Regions map.png"],["regionmapsize=325px"],["region1name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Antigua"]]}],["region1color=#71b37b"],["region1description=the main island and a major Caribbean resort destination"],["region2name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Barbuda"]]}],["region2color=#b5d29f"],["region2description=few people, even fewer facilities, magnificent beaches"],["region3name=Rodonda"],["region3color=#2a2aff"],["region3description=tiny uninhabited island"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saint John's"]]}," - Capital, on the island of Antigua"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Codrington"]]}," - A town on the island of Barbuda"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dickenson Bay"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["English Harbour"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Falmouth (Antigua)"],["Falmouth"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Half Moon Bay (Antigua)"],["Half Moon Bay"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nAll EU citizens can enter ",{"type":"'''","value":["without"]}," a visa.\n\nCitizens of the following countries may also enter without a visa:\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Albania"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Argentina"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Armenia"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Australia"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Azerbaijan"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bahamas"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Barbados"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Belarus"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Belize"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Botswana"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brazil"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brunei"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Canada"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chile"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cuba"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dominica"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fiji"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Georgia (country)"],["Georgia"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Grenada"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guyana"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jamaica"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Japan"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kazakhstan"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kenya"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kiribati"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kyrgyzstan"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lesotho"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Liechtenstein"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Malaysia"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Malawi"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Maldives"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mauritius"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mexico"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moldova"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Monaco"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Namibia"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Zealand"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nauru"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Norway"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Papua New Guinea"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Peru"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russia"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saint Kitts and Nevis"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saint Lucia"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saint Vincent and the Grenadines"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Samoa"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Seychelles"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Singapore"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Solomon Islands"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South Africa"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South Korea"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Suriname"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Swaziland"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Switzerland"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tajikistan"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tanzania"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tonga"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Trinidad and Tobago"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tuvalu"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Turkey"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Turkmenistan"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Uganda"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ukraine"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United States"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Uzbekistan"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vanuatu"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Venezuela"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zimbabwe"]]},", and citizens of British Overseas Territories.\n\nIf you do need a visa, you must have a passport valid at least 6 months after time of visit, a completed application form, and 1 passport size photo.
