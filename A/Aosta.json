Those that are open tend to be very casual, fast-food type places.\n\nAll restaurants offer a fixed price menu (menu turistico\/menu a prezzo fisso) which is not very exciting but is good if you're watching the euros. Don't forget to keep your receipt. The police can stop you and ask to see it.\n\nFor vegetarians and vegans, eating in Aosta, and Italy in general, should not be a problem. Italians are quite relaxed and accommodating when it comes to their cuisine (unlike their French neighbours). At the Aosta tourist office, staff should be able to recommend local dishes that are vegetarian or vegan, or easily rendered so. Pizza is a safe bet as the pizza dough is not made with egg or dairy products in Italy or authentic Italian restaurants elsewhere.\n\nCarbonade: ground beef meat roasted in red wine.\n\nLots of local specialities - look for the word \"Valdostana\" or \"Valdôtaine\" in the names of dishes.
