This will cost about 12'000 cedis while a Taxi ride from Accra or Cape Coast will cost at minimum 200'000.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nTaxis are not needed, or even desirable since to really soak up this pleasant and bustling village you need to be on foot. Still, if you really need the drive to the fort or beach then the Motor Park where you arrive provides ample transport.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Fort Patience"]}," construction began in 1697 but its completion did not occur until 1702. Hence the name they gave to the fort - Lijdzaamheid, meaning 'patience'. According to the local tour guide the fort was used as a holding place for slaves. In the slave quarters you will find shackles and weapons. There are great views over the bay and over the busy fish market right by the beach. The market is a superb way to take in the local culture and way of life as well as being a melange of colourful sights and sounds.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nBeaches: The beaches along the fishing area are calm but somewhat polluted.  The beaches on the other side have stronger waves but are preferable for relaxing.\n\nChurches: Many of the churches offer English sermons.\n\nAdventure: A ride in a fishing boat is easily arranged with a few extra cedis encouragement, but don't go nuts, 30'000 should be a maximum per person!\n\nSmiles: A local bar recently built is a great place to have drinks and go dancing.  They play local music but American music is available on request.  There are two dance floors, one is outside under the stars.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nThe fish market leads onto the main one where there is plenty in food terms but little in craft or cloth.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nLakeland Restaurant, is a reasonable distance from the local market, but can be reached easily in a taxi for 4GH. Therestaurant offers traditional ghanean cuisine and a nice ambiance. The outdoor seating area is  tiled with an adjacent  bar.  The food combined with the local tunes makes this part is a great place for socailizing with friends.\n\nIf you're feeling adventurous, then chop (Ghanean word for food) is available at some bars as well as the markets, but I would recommend going to Winneba or even onto Cape coast for a better meal.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nA decent range of spots of the usual Ghana standard with the usual Ghana standards-limited beers and soft drinks.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nAside from a hotel a few miles out of town (the name escapes me) the fort guest house is the only other choice, and my use of the facilities there and a quick peak into the rooms prompted a quick retreat from the proprietor. Save your money for Winneba (the Lagoon Lodge is an absolutely smashing place) or Cape Coast.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nTro-Tros and line Taxis ply the route to the junction as well as to Winneba junction.
