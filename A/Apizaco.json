To get to the mountain, either hire a taxi for about MXN200 one way, or take the colectivo (with the sign saying C.V. Malinche) for MXN25. The colectivo picks up across the street from Elektra on Serdan, three blocks south of 16 Sept. and two blocks east of the cathedral. The first colectivo leaves Apizaco at about 08:20 every morning; show up 10-15 minutes early. The last one down the mountain is at 17:00 every afternoon, and there is also a 15:00 bus F, Sa and Su. The best time to climb the volcano is in the dry season, which is winter. There may be some snow at the higher altitudes, but the hike is usually doable in tennis shoes. The altitude of the summit, 4,462m (14,640 ft), is about the same as Mount Whitney, the highest peak in California's Sierra Nevada. Some acclimatization for the altitude can be accomplished simply by staying in Apizaco, which is at 2,400m (7900 ft). Climbers in good physical condition should take about 3 to 6 hours to the summit, plus about 2 to 3 hours to descend. Further information about climbing the mountain is available on ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.summitpost.org\/la-malinche\/150260 summitpost"]}," or in R. J.
