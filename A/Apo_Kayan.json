Return flights twice a week if weather permits. The planes seat about twenty people flying in, but can only hold about fifteen people flying out due to the short runway in Long Ampung.

Good maps are practically non-existent and a lot of the trails just peter out or end at little fields in the middle of the jungle. Be sure to ask if you're still walking in the right direction whenever you meet people along the way.

You can bring in some bottles, but they won't last long. You have to drink a lot in this humid environment.

You definitely should ask a Dayak to accompany you if you are planning to leave the main trails between the villages. Getting lost and spending the night alone in an unknown jungle would definitely be a memorable experience, but probably not a pleasant one.\n\nSuspension bridges (made of wood and ropes) have the habit of swaying while you cross them. Some are old and in a state of disrepair. The Dayak know this and don't use them anymore. There are no signs to indicate their state, so if there's no-one around, you'll have to use your own judgment. If you doubt the bridge will be able to carry your weight (chances are high that you weigh more than the wiry Dayak), look for a place where the river is not too deep and wade to the other side.\n\nLog bridges can be very slippery. Don't lose your balance if you don't want to get wet.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]}," \n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["East Kalimantan"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["no Wikipedia link"]]}]
