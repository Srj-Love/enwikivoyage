Appalachia however has a very rich and diverse array of cultures albeit with a long and often troublesome history, including slavery and cruelties against Native Americans.  Today many Appalachians are proud of their Appalachian identity, and a variety of institutions work to preserve Appalachian culture and history while maintaining its diversity.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nAppalachia is English-speaking for a large majority.  The Appalachian English dialect is found through the Southern mountains, known for its many colorful phrases.  Other European and Asian languages can be found in small minority communities.  Native American languages are also spoken in Appalachian Native American communities.  The word \"Appalachia\" comes from the Apalachee nation.\n\n\"Appalachia\" is often pronounced \"ah-pah-lah-chah\" (with a silent \"i\") by Appalachians (from Apalachee, \"ah-pah-lah-chee\"), but the pronunciation of \"ah-pah-lay-shuh\" is also correct.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nIn the mountains, it is most convenient to have a car.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nRampant racism and homophobia are amongst the many stereotypes of Appalachia. Most Appalachians exhibit \"Southern hospitality\" and are decent folk, not racist, though homophobia and transphobia are more common. If you are concerned about discrimination, keep to yourself, be polite, and most people will do the same for you. Every community has its bad apples though of course. Not all Appalachian states have laws preventing discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity either. You should be prepared to see your share of Confederate flags south of the Mason-Dixon, but this is not always connected to racism, despite the historical symbology. Historically, most Appalachians were strongly antislavery and many were loyal to and fought for the Union during the Civil War, as witness West Virginia's split from Virginia. Appalachian Tennessee produced more antislavery newspapers than any other place in the country, many doing so at extreme risk. Appalachian Kentucky had racially integrated colleges nearly 100 years before desegregation. Appalachians have always valued freedom, which is actually the West Virginia state motto (",{"type":"''","value":["montani semper liberi"]},", translated \"mountaineers are always free\").\n\nIf you are staying in a small town or away from an urban area, make sure you know what to do if a black bear makes its way into town or your camp. It is not common but bears are known to come into small towns to forage for food. Other hazards include mountain weather, which can change on a dime and include tornadoes and blizzards, and landslides on mountain roads. Always make sure you obey the speed limit on windy roads (often down to 15 mph on tight curves); unlike the interstate where you may get away with it, speeding on a mountain road may find yourself flying off a cliff.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["United States of America"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["extraregion"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Appalachia"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["38.8"],["-81"]]}]
