Prior to World War II, the city was known for growing award winning apples.  The local apple crops were decimated by three devastating years of fungal infection and extreme weather in the mid 1940s.  Ironically, the Postal Service approved the name \"Apple Valley\" for the local post office in 1949, after destruction of most of the local orchards and the end of the commercial apple industry in the area.\n\nApple Valley's claim to fame is as the home and final resting place of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, stars of many western films and television shows from the 1930s to the 1950s.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nApple Valley is located along State Route 18, about 7.5 miles (12 km) east of Interstate 15, midway between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Bernardino"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Barstow"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\nThe nearest commercial airport is Ontario International Airport ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.lawa.org\/welcomeONT.aspx"]},", 55 miles (88.5 km) southwest of Apple Valley in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ontario (California)"],["Ontario"]]},".
