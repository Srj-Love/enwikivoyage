It is spoken in many popular destinations in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Africa"]]}," and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Middle East"]]},". There are many regional dialects, but a standard Arabic language is maintained due to religious needs and region-wide media.\n\nArabic is written from right to left. It has its own alphabet, different from the Roman alphabet used for English.\n\nFor communication purposes while traveling and using this guide, it is very important to note that Arabic is divided into Standard Arabic (mostly used in print) and Colloquial Arabic.  Colloquial Arabic is further subdivided into regional colloquial dialects, the main regions being the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Levant"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Persian Gulf States"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Egypt"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Africa"]]},". These regional colloquial dialects sometimes differ enough to be mutually incomprehensible.\n\nAlthough Modern Standard Arabic is not the native language of anyone, it is taught and used as the medium of instruction in all schools in Arabic-speaking countries, and is universally recognised as the official form of Arabic. Therefore, while people from different Arabic-speaking regions may not understand each other's dialect, they will generally be able to communicate with each other in Standard Arabic. As such, by learning how to speak Standard Arabic, you can generally communicate with any educated person in Arabic-speaking areas.\n\nThe pronunciation guide below uses Modern Standard Arabic and Levantine Colloquial Arabic.\n \n",{"type":"==","value":["Pronunciation guide"]},"\nArabic pronunciation varies regionally.
