These are reasonably priced and usually come with a local guide with roots on the island going back generations. Tourism is the main \"industry\" on the island (Inis Mor), and in exchange for supporting the locals, you not only get a dry tour of all the significant sites on the island, but also an entertaining and informative history lesson. Two drivers who are particularly recommended are Martin Mullen and Oliver Faherty. Both families have lived there for generations and will share their stories openly. You might even offer to buy them a pint at Joe Mac's, next to the hostel, as a tip for the ride.  Arrange a tour with either of them with the ferry company when you buy tickets for the trip over to the island. Another way to see the islands is on foot. While you may balk at the seemingly 'touristy' nature of the pony carts which will be waiting for you in Cill Rónáin, paying the little bit extra for one of these is often worth it -- striking up conversation with your driver may get you invited to dinner or a party.\n\nIf you have time, consider walking the islands to see the sights.  It is easy to walk on the roads between sights and you are more likely to really begin to understand the scale of the islands and the feel of the place.
