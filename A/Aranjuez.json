As well as being level, they boast elegant, tree-lined, shade and shingle surfaces. Radiating like a clock from the Doce Calles (12 ways) roundabout\/kiosk-bar, some border the river, whilst others lead to a new- park - the steep slope known as ",{"type":"''","value":["talud sur de la Montaña"]},"  which has an ancient water-wheel and path-extensions all bicycle or wheelchair accessible and suitable for the fitter users.\n\nThroughout its history as a royal estate from 1560 , the steep-sided, fertile valley at the confluence of the rivers Tagus and Jarama  (known as the Cuenca del Tago) has been cultivated for the amusement and diversion of the nobility as well as for the practical purpose of providing delightful fresh produce for the royal tables. The descriptions below are modern interpretations of extracts from historical documents.\n\nIn the 16th century, during the reign of Philip II a vast area in front of the royal palace was a managed garden of ponds or pools in which water-fowl such as ducks and geese were reared. In 1613 he ordered shaded, tree-lined walk-ways and rides known as  Doce Calles (12 ways) to be planted with elms, ash, chestnut walnut and mulberry trees. The design is geometric and vaguely astrological in keeping with the then fashionable mystery of majesty.\n\nIn 1601 the existing Texeras horticultural garden along the river Tagus was expanded so that by 1604 this area became a substantial kitchen garden for the royal estate.\n\nOn the high ground livestock were kept, and from  1599 vegetables were produced on land adjoining the Casa del Matadero, (an abattoir, probably near the present La Finca).\n\nIn 1716 a garden for Queen Maria-Louise (wife of Philip V) was created with fountains, musical machines  and similar amusing diversions. At the same time the Potaxia del Jardin de la Reina produced more exotic vegetables from the new world such as bananas and pineapples using advanced horticultural techniques.\n\nIn 1747 King Fernando VI  extended existing woodland with a variety of trees and introduced Iberian plane trees, initially  to line calles Rey and Rebollo (King and Oak streets)  The 'new' and elegant plane (Platinus hispanica) which now grace calle sin salida. is a cultivar developed by cross fertilization from both oriental and occidental varieties of plain trees \n\nBy 1756 a wider variety of fruit and nut trees were incorporated, while Aranjuez strawberries and asparagus began to be commercialized. Hereabouts became renowned for the songs of nightingales, larks blackbirds and goldfinches.\n\nThe reign of Carlos III in late 18th century saw a considerable increase in activity with the construction of the cattle ranch (La Finca) the royal farm, winery and hermitage el Cortijo Real and Bodega de Carlos III as well as the main highways linking these sites to the palace with a road from Madrid to Colmenar   (now the M305) \n\nDuring more than a decade from 1772 the cultivation was extended to encircle the palace and the town, which is when El Delete (the delight) was constructed to define the southern margin of the town. Thereafter pleasure gardens and hunting forests  gave way to horticulture or agriculture, notably vineyards and olive groves.\n\nAt the end of the 18th century, a telegraph office was established atop Parnaso Hill, affording the king  rapid communication with every part of his  kingdom. \n\nIn the 19th century commercial tree plantations were established, and in the 20th century commercial farming took over, with first sugar beet, and later sweet corn as major cash crops. The ruined sugar refinery is near the railway station, which incidentally has extensive cargo sidings intended for transporting bulk agricultural produce. The vast railway infrastructure to the west of the palace is now mostly abandoned although some areas became used as commuter car-parking during the late 20th century\n\nThe last royal resident to use Aranjuez as a springtime residence was King Alfonso XIII who ceded to the second republic shortly after his visit in 1930\n",{"type":"====","value":["La Montaña"]},"\nAlthough calle sin salida means the street with no exit, a strong bridge now extends the route to La Montaña. This was constructed in 2012 to provide convenient access to the hillside for pedestrians, cyclists, various leisure pursuits and rural maintenance activities.\n\nToday these tree-lined walkways known as doce calles are highly valued, and each year a different street is selected for renovation, with old trees felled and replaced with saplings where necessary. The wide variety of wood harvested is used in the public interest notably for the conservation of historic artifacts and maintenance of the authentic assets of the Aranjuez world heritage sites. \n\nThe adjacent  hillside park with its reconstructed arabic 'noria' waterwheel (which now includes  a small hydraulic demonstration site) was opened in 2013. Climb the hill, follow the road to the right to a café called La Cazuela del Chiquitin which terrace offers a panoramic view: far left the clock-tower of el Cortijo is visible through the trees the town is to the south and the dome of palace (buried in trees) is the extreme right, immediately below the mountains of Toledo (visible only on clear days)  .
