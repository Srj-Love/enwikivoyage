The town is quite small and scenic, so unless you have a disability, you will more than likely be compelled to get around without the car.  You will, however, need a vehicle to get to the nearest towns (Frankfort, Bear Lake, Onekama, et cetera) for groceries and supplies not available in Arcadia.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThe place worth visiting in Arcadia is the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.arcadiami.com\/ Arcadia Historical Museum"]}," - run by volunteers, it is one of the best run facilities describing the history of a town that I've seen!  If you have Manistee county relatives who may have lived in the area, you can find out about them here. We bought a house in this town and had no idea that one of my relatives had been a caretaker of some property just south of Arcadia lake!  The Arcadia Historical museum is very low key in asking for donations (ie.. they don't) but just the same, if you visit, throw in the bowl what you think the visit is worth. The museum features old yearbooks, maps, and photos.  It has exhibits dedicated to Henry Starke, Harriet Quimby, and other historical figures of Arcadia's rich past.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Contact Info:"]}," +1 231 889-4360\n\nArcadia Area Historical Society\n\nBox 67\n\nArcadia, MI 49613\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Golf"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:View of the 12th hole, par 3 at Chestnut Hills Golf Course.jpg"],["thumb"],["350px"],["The par 3 12th hole at Chestnut Hills Golf Course"]]},"\n\nArcadia has two golf courses.

Lake Arcadia is an option for swimming, but most opt not to due to it's proximity to the bluer, Lake Michigan.  There is also a very small public beach on Lake Michigan in the unincorporated community of Pierport, which is 5 miles to the south of Arcadia.  Some people choose to swim at the South pier.
