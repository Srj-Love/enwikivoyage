It is well known for its hippie counter culture, progressive politics, and vegetarian restaurants. Arcata is the perfect place to relax and enjoy life the way it should be, enjoying fresh air and an unbeatable natural environment. The pace of things is a little calmer here, with usually as many bicyclists or people on foot as cars go by. Sometimes referred to as being \"behind the Redwood Curtain\", Arcata has a unique culture that makes you realize that the \"outside\" world may not have all the answers.\n\nDue to its tolerant residents, Arcata attracts a large \"transient\" population, many of whom you will find on the Plaza. Most of these people are harmless \"dharma bums\". Expect to be asked for change every so often but don't feel pressured to give any.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Car"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" There are basically only 2 roads in.
