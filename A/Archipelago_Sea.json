People have settled in the bigger islands and made journeys to outer islets for fish, seal and water fowl. The present villages are often from the middle ages. \n\nAs the expected standards of living have risen dramatically since the World War, many have left for the towns. Islands that had twohundred inhabitants may now have only one or a few families living there permanently. But those who left often return for vacations (perhaps also when retiring, at least to islands with services), together with large crowds of tourists, yacht cruisers and summer guests.\n\nIn the last decades there has also been young families moving out, even to remote islands. Some find a local income, other work on distance or on ships with week on\/week off schemes, still others just take a year off.\n\nThe conditions in the archipelago differ significantly from those in the mainland. People have a strong local identity. Services are often far away and people are quite self sufficient. Farmland areas are small even in the main islands and people have always got their living in small pieces, such as from fishing, agriculture, sea fowl and seal hunting – and seafaring. Today tourism is an important side income for many. Fishing and navigating the archipelago is in the blood.\n\nThere is a huge difference, though, between conditions in the main islands, with road conenction to services, and the remote islands, with only daily connections – weather, ice conditions (and whatever) permitting. The remote islands are often inhabited by just one or a few families.\n\nMost businesses are small. Advance bookings are appreciated, and often necessary to get some of the service. On the other hand there is much flexibility; things can usually be arranged, if asked for in time.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Climate "]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Minnets utlopp januari 2011.jpg"],["thumb"],["Minor lake by Pargas centre."]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Halikonlahti helmikuussa.JPG"],["thumb"],["Halikko bay in February 2008."]]},"\n\nDay temperatures in the summer are typically 15–25°C. The sea has a moderating effect on the weather, especially when not frozen, giving warm autumns. There is more sunshine and less rain in the archipelago than in the mainland. Winds are varying with westerlies dominating. Storms are unusual (in Finnish waters strong gale is regarded as storm), especially in spring and summer.\n\nIn the winter ice covers the Archipelago Sea (often all of the northern Baltic Sea), but there is not always enough snow for skiing (other than on the ice, conditions permitting).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Right to access "]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Right to access"]]}," is in practice somewhat restricted in parts of the archipelago. The right comes with the duty not to disturb or cause harm, and where islands are small and rocky, the areas where the right can be exercised may be limited. The nature is often fragile and e.g. nesting birds are easily disturbed.\n\nWhere berries are sparse, they may be better left to locals. There are even locations where wild berries are being taken care of and the land thus even legally regarded as farmland.\n\nWhen nesting birds or birds with chicks are disturbed, eggs and chicks often get into the beaks of crows and gulls, waiting for such opportunities. Thus landing on islets with nesting birds or driving near swimming bird families – or letting even a friendly dog loose – may cause significant damage.

The ferries often call at the islands only when needed (make sure you are noticed!), at some islands only on special request beforehand.\n\nThese ferries can be used for island hopping or for a one day tour in the outer archipelago. There is usually some kind of spartan café and nice views, but few other attractions on board. With some luck there are locals willing to chat.

Small boats are ideal to get around near the place where you are staying (a cottage, pension or the like). For longer journeys a yacht with cooking and sleeping facilities is probably what you want (but an oversize yacht will make mooring in nature harbours difficult).\n\nCrewed chartering is considered expensive.

It is a maze. Take a good look at the (large scale) chart before deciding whether you are up to it. GPS is a valuable tool, but you should not trust the navigation to it. If you have local friends they might come (or find somebody willing) to act as skipper or pilot. For sea charts and harbour books, see ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Get in"],["Get in"]]}," above.\n\nBeware of traffic in the main shipping lanes. Cruise ferries will approach in more than 20 knots (40 km\/h) and will often not be able to stop or turn.\n\nMost inhabited islands, at least the remote ones, tend to have some kind of guest harbour and service for tourists. For electricity, waste bins and showers you should head for the bigger ones, but sauna, freshly smoked fish, handicraft or a nature trail may be available anywhere.\n\nWeather reports are available on VHF (check Turku Radio working channels for your location beforehand), Navtex, FM radio, TV and Internet",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.fmi.fi"]},{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/m.fmi.fi"]},", by SMS and at bigger marinas. Use the forecasts for mariners, as weather on land may be quite different.

The general emergency number 112 often has a pretty obscure picture of the conditions in the archipelago (you tell coordinates and name of island and they ask for a street address; try to stay calm), but can also be contacted, especially if you have no marin VHF and mobil phone signal is bad (for 112, the phone can use any operator).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By canoe or kayak "]},"\n\nThe perhaps best way to explore the Archipelago Sea is by sea kayak.

Help with route planning and maps is also given by them. \n\nSome of the advice for yachters is equally adequate for canoers, but some is not. You should look out not only for the big ships, but also for powerboats. Staying near the shore and traversing channels quickly is the standard advice.
