On the ",{"type":"''","value":["rutas"]},", in the provinces bordering other countries, the police frequently stop cars at ",{"type":"''","value":["controles policiales"]}," (\"police checkpoints\") to check insurance and registration papers and drivers' licenses. They do not stop all cars, though; when you come to a ",{"type":"''","value":["control policial"]},", drive slowly and you will usually be waved through without stopping. Near provincial borders, these ",{"type":"''","value":["controles"]}," may also involve inspection of the trunk for contraband and a mandatory two peso fee for \"disinfection\" or removing insects from the car's underside by driving it over a mechanical sprayer that either sprays water or does nothing. The police have been known to set up roadblocks and demand bribes for passage, particularly around the city of Buenos Aires.\n\nTraffic regulations in Argentina are generally the same as in the U.S. or Europe, but the locals often ignore the regulations. On roads and highways it´s mandatory to have car lights on, even during daytime. Be aware that the driving style in Argentina is aggressive and chaotic. Pay attention at night.\n\nMaximum speed: 60 km\/h in the city, 40 km\/h on side roads and 100 km\/h to 130 km\/h on roads outside the city as well as on highways. There are frequent speed controls. However speed limits and lane markings are universally ignored, and running red lights is common. Most drivers treat stop signs, octagonal red signs reading ",{"type":"''","value":["PARE"]},", as though they were \"yield\" signs, though some drivers ignore them completely. Within cities surrounding Buenos Aires it is proper to honk at an impending intersection and the one who honks first has right of way. Right of way is determined somewhat haphazardly by a combination of vehicle size and who arrives first. Make sure you are thoroughly confident in your driving skills before attempting to drive in Argentina.\n\nHighways are limited to the areas around large cities. Most of the country is connected by paved unlit two-lane roads (",{"type":"''","value":["rutas"]},") shared by buses, cars, and large trucks. Some places are accessible only by gravel or dirt roads - indeed, some main roads in southern Argentina are unsealed, leading to 4x4 vehicles being more popular. This is particularly the case in the south. It is important to travel with a good map ( e.g. ",{"type":"''","value":["Argentina Waterproof Road Map"]}," from World Mapping Project) and to be well informed about your route distances, road conditions and the estimated travel time. In addition to a good map the website of ",{"type":"''","value":["cochera andina"]}," publishes useful information on more than 120 routes in Argentina.\n\nThe current cost of gasoline in central and southern Argentina is approximately 6 pesos per litre. In many small towns, particularly in the north, they may ration gasoline to ensure they have enough to sell until the next refuelling truck arrives, in which case you will only be allowed to buy 30 pesos worth of fuel at a time. It's advisable to fill your tank at regular intervals when the opportunity arises. In the Andes, the gasoline consumption of non-turbo charged engines increases due to the altitude.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By thumb"]},"\nThe ",{"type":"[[","value":[["hitchhiking"],["hitchhiking club"]]}," ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.autostopargentina.com.ar\/ Autostop Argentina"]}," began in Argentina in 2002, inspired by clubs in France Germany, Italy and the United States. As a result, hitchhiking has become more acceptable among the younger generation, and raising a thumb at a highway is a symbol most people understand.\n\nToday, nevertheless, the thumb of a woman is gigantically more successful than the thumb of a man. A single man should count on long hours of waiting or just plain luck. If you do get a ride, you will in general be treated with much generosity though.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["Hey Big Balls"],["¡Che boludo! (poorly translated in the title) Che (used as injunctive, the root is indigenous) get's used a lot in casual speech ...between friends. It's why the Cubans nicknamed Ernesto Guevara, Che Guevara. It's a uniquely Argentine habit. Well Some Chileans use it, slightly differently, “Che huevón”\n\nDon't be surprised if you hear some creative terms of endearment on the street. It's not uncommon to refer to one's friends as boludo (\"big balls\", which is a poor interpretation) or loco (\"crazy\"). If you read a bit about Lunfardo, you begin to see Argentines love to play with language, and  love using nicknames. An essay by Santiago Kovadloff explains it well; ",{"type":"''","value":["A person who is overweight or fat is simply referred to by his friends as “flaco”"]}," (skinny) ...",{"type":"''","value":["an intelligent person with a great talent to gain the respect of their peers is “un hijo de puta”"]}," (an idiot). It may seem counter intuitive to some, but friends do this as terms of endearment. They run the gamut. Negro (which has no negative connotation at all in Spanish) is a popular nickname regardless of a person's color. Loco is used interchangeably with boludo. Boludo can best be compared to how bollocks is used in Ireland: To a stranger it's an insult; to a friend it's a term of endearment. \n\nThis sort of blunt address is considered normal in Argentina. Try to take it lightly, as it is usually not meant to offend, but don't copy it. It takes time to understand the nuances of colloquialisms."]]},"\n\nThe official language is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Spanish Phrasebook"],["Spanish"]]},". Generally, most people speak Spanish using a local dialect, ",{"type":"''","value":["Castellano Rioplatense"]},", which is subtly different from both the language of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Spain"]]}," and that of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Central America"]]},". Most notably, the pronoun \"tu\" is replaced by \"vos\", and the you plural pronoun \"vosotros\" replaced with \"ustedes\", the latter being common throughout Latin America. Besides, there are separate verb conjugations, sometimes significantly different for irregular verbs in present tense and informal commands. Additionally, people from each city pronounce words differently too! In this way, people from Buenos Aires speak differently compared to those from Spain and other Spanish speaking countries; example: ",{"type":"''","value":["chicken"]}," in Spanish (",{"type":"''","value":["pollo"]},") is pronounced ",{"type":"''","value":["PO-zhO"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["PO-SHO"]}," by the \"Porteños\" (residents of Buenos Aires), with the ",{"type":"''","value":["SH"]}," sound harder than in Spanish; unlike most other Spanish speakers of South America who pronounces it ",{"type":"''","value":["PO-yo"]},". However, all Argentinians learn standard Castillian Spanish in school, so while not the first language of choice, people would generally be competent enough to communicate.\n\nRioplatense Spanish is also heavily influenced by ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Italian"]]},", even frequently being mistaken for it, a result of the large influx of Italian immigrants. Hand gestures derived from Italy are extremely common, and many colloquialisms are borrowed from Italian (for example: instead of saying \"cerveza\", which means beer, youngsters find \"birra\" cooler, which is in Italian). Most locals can readily understand most Spanish dialects, as well as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Portuguese"]]}," or Italian (especially due to its similarity to the local Spanish). English is mandatory in high school and usually understood in at least a basic level in tourists' areas. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["German"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["French"]]}," can be understood and to some extent spoken by small fractions of the population. A few places in Patagonia near Rawson have native Welsh speakers.  Words borrowed from aboriginal languages include: quechua, guarani, mataco, che, mate and others.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["Hurlingham?"],["Although there's a community of descendants of Welsh immigrants on the Pampas, and Scots and Irish communities too, it's not these impoverished emigrant communities that have had the biggest influence in Argentina; that was from rich, monied investors that had the financial wherewithal to send their children to English boarding schools and universities.\n\nCommonwealth English is certainly not an official language, but has historically been the variety widely used by the educated elite in Argentina.\n\nThanks to groups like the Argentine British Community Council (ABCC) it's possible that British expats may in fact feel more at home in Argentina than in Britain. Constantly arranging truly “British” events such as car boot sales, village fetes, fun runs and fundraisers, the ABCC see their duty as upholding the British tradition, which includes saying “please”, “thank you” and being on time! Argentina is the country with the biggest British community in Latin America, has many cities founded by Englishmen, and 80% of Buenos Aires' private schools are British. Argentina could have been, along with Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, the fourth British colonised country in the Southern Hemisphere! \n\nBuenos Aires used to have the only Harrods store outside the UK and continues to have the most important and oldest English newspaper in Latin America, the Buenos Aires Herald. Just a few of the towns established by British settlers in the Buenos Aires Province of Argentina: Hughes, Rawson, Hudson, Hurlingham, Temperley, Banfield, O'Higgins, Brandsen, Parish, Fair, Barker, Bunge, Tornquist, Roberts, Gunther, Gahan, Abott, Anderson, and Warnes.\n\nFew sights present as quintessentially British a scene as admiring the immaculately trimmed polo fields of the Hurlingham Club or watching a football match between St Andrews School and Balmoral College. The Anglophile can attain a pinnacle of perfection by taking afternoon tea while leisurely browsing through the local news in the Herald."]]},"\nThe interjection \"che\" is extremely common and means approximately the same thing as English \"hey!\". It can also be employed as a phrase known to someone you don't remember their names. Ex: \"Escucháme, Che,....\" Sometimes it is peppered throughout the speech, similar to the English phrase \"yo,\" as in \"What's up, yo?\"  Nonetheless, communication will not be a problem for any Spanish speaker.\n\nArgentines will communicate with each other using lunfardo, a street dialect or slang. It is used together with Spanish by replacing nouns with their synonyms in lunfardo. As opposed to changing the original meaning, it just makes the phrase more colourful. An important aspect of lunfardo is that it is only spoken. For example, one knows the word dinero (money), but may use the word \"guita\" in order to refer to the same things. Lunfardo is composed of about 5,000 words, many of which do not appear in the dictionary.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nFor many travellers, Argentina as a country has the same seductive appeal as the tango it's famous for.

However, due to the National Government's policies and the market's lack of trust in the peso, the free exchange rate (the only one possible, as the government has now banned all access to US dollars) is about 10 pesos per US dollar (although it fluctuates wildly).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Black market"]},"\nThe government pegs the peso at an artificially high level and heavily restricts currency exchange from pesos into dollars, leading to a thriving black market in the \"blue dollar\" (",{"type":"''","value":["dólar blue"]},"). The market is so huge that the latest rates are published in newspapers and on websites like ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/dolarblue.net\/ DolarBlue.net"]},". As of February 2014, the government rate is 7.80 pesos per US dollar, while the black market rate fluctuates around ARS11.40 = USD1. This translates to USD100 being worth around 780 pesos if exchanged officially or withdrawn from an ATM, versus 1120 pesos on the black market. Other currencies like the Chilean and Uruguayan peso exhibit similar behaviour, although the dollar commands a premium.

Present both simultaneously at checkout and with confidence.  A lack of confidence will lead to a request for your passport as identification. For larger purchases such as long-distance bus tickets you will need to present your passport and your credit card.  Although this makes shopping difficult, do try to keep your passport in a location such as a hotel-room safe.\n\nAs of 2011, unlike other parts of South America such as Peru, the credit card purchasing systems do not support credit card PINs.

At times, the exchange rate can present good value for international tourists.  For example, in early 2006 the dollar and the euro were strong in comparison with the then-weak Argentina peso.\n\nFashionable clothing and leather products can be found in most commercial areas; jackets, boots and shoes are easily available. However, Buenos Aires has a relatively mild climate, so truly cold-weather gear is harder to find here.  Long coats or heavy gloves may not be in stock; similarly, jeans and other basics have a thin construction compared with those in cooler countries. The Andes regions and Patagonia are considerably colder in the winter, so thick clothing is much easier to find here.\n\nElectronics are not cheap, as they are subject to heavy import tariffs.  The price of music, books, and movies lags slightly behind changes in the exchange rate and can offer a bargain if the volatile exchange rates are in your favour.\n\nMost freestanding shops in Buenos Aires are open 10:00-20:00 on weekdays, and some of them also Saturdays and Sundays, depending on what area of the city they are in. Enclosed malls, however, set their own hours, and are also open on the weekends.\n\nMost places outside of the city of Buenos Aires, where most stores remain open during a siesta, still observe a siesta from approximately noon until 16:00; almost all businesses are closed during this time.

Typically, it consists of a hot drink (coffee, tea, milk) with some toasts, medialunas (croissants, literally \"halfmoons\"), or bread.\n\nHotels typically provide a free buffet consisting of coffee, tea, drinkable yogurt, assorted pastries and toast, fruit, and perhaps cereal. These kinds of breakfasts are also readily available in the many cafes.\n\nLunch is a big meal in Argentina, typically taken in the early afternoon. Lunch is so big because dinner is not until late: 20:30 to 21:00 at the earliest, more commonly at 22:00 or even later. Most restaurants do not serve food until then except for pastries or small ham-and-cheese toasted sandwiches (tostados), for afternoon tea 18:00-20:00. Tea is the one meal that is rarely skipped. A few cafés do offer heartier fare all day long, but don't expect anything more substantial than pizza or a milanesa (breaded meat fillets) or a lomito (steak sandwiches) outside of normal Argentine mealtimes. Dinner is usually eaten at 22:00 and typically consists of appetizers, a main course, and desserts.\n\nBy the way, North Americans should beware that Argentinians use the term \"entrée\" to refer to appetizers. This is common outside of North America but can surprise some Canadians and most Americans. Only in those parts of North America outside of the province of Quebec) is the \"entrée\" a \"main dish\". In Argentina the main dish is a \"plato principal\".\n\nThe entrée in Argentina typically consists of empanadas (baked pastries with a meat filling), chorizo or morcilla (meat or blood sausage), and assortments of achuras (entrails). For a main dish there is usually bife de chorizo (sirloin \/ New York Strip steak) and various types of salads. Dessert is often a custard with dulce de leche and whipped cream topping.\n\nBeef is a prominent component of the Argentine diet and Argentine beef is world-famous for good reason. Argentina and Uruguay are the top 2 countries in meat per capita consumption in the world. Definitely check out Argentine barbecue: asado, sometimes also called parrillada, because it is made on a parrilla, or grill. There is no way around it - foodwise Argentina is virtually synonymous with beef. The beef is some of the best in the world, and there are many different cuts of meat. Lomo (tenderloin) and bife de chorizo are excellent. \"Costillas\" (ribs) is considered by locals the real \"asado\" meat cut and is very tasty. North Americans will see that costillas are different to those at home. Argentinians cut ribs perpendicular to the bone. Having a parrillada dinner is one of the best ways to experience Argentine cuisine; preferably with a bottle of wine and a good amount of salads. In some popular areas, parrilladas are available from small buffets, or sidewalk carts and barbecue trailers. Skewers and steak sandwiches can then be purchased to go.\n\nGiven that a large portion of Argentines are of Italian, Spanish and French descent, such fare is very widespread and of high quality; pizzerias and specialized restaurants are very common. Take note that a convention observed in Argentina is to treat the pasta and sauce as separate items; some travellers have found out what they thought was cheap pasta only to find that they were not getting any sauce. You will see the pastas for one price and then the sauces for an additional charge.\n\nCafés, bakeries, and ice-cream shops (heladerías) are very popular. Inexpensive and high-quality snacks can be found in most commercial areas, and many have outdoor seating areas. Empanadas (turnovers) containing meats, cheeses, or many other fillings can be bought cheaply from restaurants or lunch counters. The Alfajor is a must try snack of a two cookies with a dulce de leche filling and can be purchased at virtually any local kiosco.\n\nSmoking is now prohibited in most of Buenos Aires' restaurants and all of Mendoza's restaurants.

Although usually drunk hot, ",{"type":"''","value":["mate"]}," can also be served cold, usually known as \"tereré\" - the version that is preferred in Paraguay. Mate contains less caffeine than coffee, but contains other vitamins and minerals that give it a stimulating effect, particularly to those who are not used to it. It is naturally rather bitter, so it's not uncommon to add sugar. The drinking of mate with friends is an important social ritual in Argentina. The informal tea ceremony is led by a \"cebador\" or server and people arrange themselves in a \"rueda\" or wheel. Those who like the drink bitter and those who like it sweet are clustered together to aide the server.\n\nArgentina is renowned for its excellent selection of ",{"type":"'''","value":["wine"]},". The most popular being Mendoza which is rated among the worlds most popular regions due to its high altitude, volcanic soils and proximity to the Andes Mountains. The terrain seems to complement the European grape varietals with interesting notes not present when produced in other climates, this allows the Argentine wine to be positioned in a league of its own. The best way to experience and understand the selection of Argentine varietals is one of the many tasting events.\n\nThe legal drinking age is officially 18, although most establishments will serve anyone approximately 16 or older. Most restaurants serve a broad range of ",{"type":"'''","value":["liquors"]},". ",{"type":"'''","value":["Beer"]}," is offered in draft form in a ",{"type":"''","value":["chopp"]}," (small glass) or served in bottles or cans, and is typically a light, easily drinkable lager. The most popular locally made brands of beer are Quilmes, Isenbeck, Schneider and Brahma (although it's Brazilian). Widely-available imports include Warsteiner, Heineken, Budweiser and Corona. There are now many small pubs and bars in Buenos Aires that brew beer on premises, but most of these offer a poor quality product compared to what is widely available in parts of the USA and Europe. In the Buenos Aires area, the Buller Brewing Company in Recoleta and the Antares Brewery in Mar del Plata offer excellent handcrafted English\/American style ales. Ask if there are \"cervezas artesanales\" to discover if there are locally hand crafted beers.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Fernet"]}," is widely consumed by Argentinians, especially in Córdoba, Santa Fe and Buenos Aires. Originally from Italy, it's a bitter drink made from herbs, with 40% alcohol by volume and dark brown in hue. It can be mixed with Coke (served in bars, pubs, clubs) and if you go to an Argentinian house they will have Fernet and Coke to offer you. Also, Fernet is usually served as a digestif after a meal, but may also be enjoyed with coffee and espresso, or mixed into coffee and espresso drinks. It may be enjoyed at room temperature or with ice.\n\nCafés often have fresh-squeezed ",{"type":"'''","value":["fruit juices"]},", which is otherwise hard to find.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nA wide range of accommodation possibilities are available in Buenos Aires  and the rest of the country, from student ",{"type":"[[","value":[["hostels"]]}," to homey bed and breakfasts to trendy boutique hotels in the city to luxurious palaces and modern five-star hotels.

Drive around and look for signs saying ",{"type":"''","value":["alquiler"]}," (\"rental\"), or check the classified section of any major newspaper.\n\nBear in mind that, except in the 5-star hotels, usually the rooms are not as large as in hotels around the world.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Learn"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Buenos Aires-La Boca-P2070009.jpg"],["thumb"],["Tango is never far away when you're wandering through Buenos Aires"]]},"\nThere are a lot of public and private quality institutes who give Spanish lessons, and many more for Tango lessons, Argentinean art and literature, architecture.\n\nApart from Buenos Aires, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mendoza"]]}," is another popular and excellent place to take Spanish lessons for those who want a more idyllic setting (see the entry for Mendoza for details).\n\nEducation in Argentina is free for everyone, no matter the level, and it has a good quality.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nArgentina has the highest traffic mortality rate in South America at 12.6 per 100,000 inhabitants. To put that in perspective, the figures for the USA and UK are 10.4 and 2.75 respectively. Drivers in Argentina kill 20 each day (about 7,000 a year), with more than 120,000 injured people each year. These deaths have included some unfortunate tourists. Pedestrians should exercise extreme caution. Do not jaywalk if you do not feel comfortable, and always keep your eyes about you when crossing the street.\n\nThere is plenty of activity and foot traffic throughout the night. Nice areas have a very thorough police presence, perhaps one officer per 3 blocks, plus store security and auxiliary patrols. Public security in all major cities like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Buenos Aires"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Córdoba (city, Argentina)"],["Córdoba"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rosario"]]}," is handled by the Federal Police and the National Gendarmerie or the Naval Prefecture, especially in the Puerto Madero area of Buenos Aires.\n\nAs in any large city, certain particular neighbourhoods in Buenos Aires and other cities are very dangerous. Some shady neighbourhoods include Retiro, Villa Lugano, La Boca and Villa Riachuelo. Ask trusted locals, such as hotel desk staff or police officers, for advice. Pay attention to your environment and trust your instincts. If an area seems questionable, leave.\n\nMany people in the street and in the subway hand out small cards with horoscopes, lottery numbers, pictures of saints, or cute drawings on them. If you take the card, the person will ask for payment. You can simply return the card along with a ",{"type":"''","value":["no, gracias."]}," or simply in silence if your Spanish is not good. Persistent panhandlers are usually not dangerous; a polite but firm ",{"type":"''","value":["no tengo nada"]}," (\"I don't have anything\") and\/or hand gestures are usually enough.\n\nMost robberies are not violent, if it is just give the robbers everything, because they may be on drugs, drunk, have a knife or a gun; in most cases, if your wallet is stolen, you won't even notice until hours later. In the unlikely event that you are confronted by a mugger, simply hand over your valuables - they are replaceable. Watch out for pickpockets in the subway and on crowded city streets. Never hang your purse or bag from the back of your chair in a cafe or restaurant - stealthy theft from such bags is common. Keep your purse or backpack on the floor between your legs while you eat.\n\nPopular demonstrations are very common in Buenos Aires, and are best avoided by tourists as these demonstrations sometimes grow into violent confrontations with the police or National Gendarmerie, particularly as they approach the government buildings in the city centre.\n\nSince 2005 the government has cracked down on illegal taxis very successfully. Petty crime continues (like taking indirect routes or, less commonly, giving counterfeits in change). Taxicabs that loiter in front of popular tourist destinations like the National Museum are looking for tourists. Stay away from them. Your chance of falling prey to a scam increases in these situations. Stopping a cab a block or two away on a typical city street where others locals would do the same is good choice. Also having small bills will help you avoid issues mentioned, as well you will often find taxis that don't have change for 100 peso bills.\n\nCarry some ID with you, but not your original passport; a copy (easily provided by your own hotel) should be enough.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Ezeiza International Airport Security Warning"]},"\nIn July 2007, Argentina's TV network \"Canal 13\" conducted an investigation revealing that a group of security operators at the airport were stealing valuable objects such as iPods, digital cameras, cellular phones, sun glasses, jewellery and laptops while scanning the checked luggage of passengers. According to the special report, security operators at the airport should check each bag before putting it into the plane; however, some operators take advantage of the scanner machine to detect valuable objects and steal them. The report states that this event occurs every day and that the stolen items include anything from electronic devices to perfumes and works of art.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["You're strongly encouraged to place high-value items in your carry-on luggage to prevent any incidents."]},"\n\nPolice officers will often try to get you to bribe them during a traffic stop.

",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yellow fever"]]}," vaccinations are recommended for those visiting the Northern forests. Different climate conditions might take your body by surprise, so be aware of the weather before you arrive.  An ",{"type":"[[","value":[["travellers' diarrhea"],["upset stomach"]]}," is the most you're likely to have to worry about as your body adjusts to local micro-organisms in the food. It's also best to ease yourself gently into the local diet – sudden quantities of red meat, red wine, strong coffee and sweet pastries can be very unsettling for a stomach used to gentler repasts – and though tap water in Argentina is safe to drink, if sometimes heavily chlorinated, you may prefer to err on the side of caution in rural areas in the north of the country.\n\nAlthough oral contraceptives are sold over the counter, without a prescription, a woman considering taking them is well advised first to consult a wise and licensed physician about their proper use, as well as possible contraindications and side effects.\n\nHospitals are free. They won´t charge you for any treatment, but it is customary to offer a contribution, if you have the means. In public\/state run hospitals, it is now illegal for any hospital employee to receive or even ask for payment. This does not include private health care facilities, or for medicines.\n\nIf you are feeling ill, but its not an emergency, go to a pharmacy. Every pharmacy has a licensed pharmacist as part of their staff who can suggest which medication to take. Until recently, most prescribed medicines have not required a prescription, with the exception of psychoactive or stronger narcotic drugs; however, many pharmacies have been insisting on doctor's prescriptions lately. Pharmacies are located all over the country, and for simple ailments, they are much more convenient then a trip to the hospital or 'sanatorio' or 'clinica' for a doctor's prescription, will you just take to the pharmacy.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sunburn and sun protection"],["Sun block"]]}," is recommended in the north of the country, where the heat can be intense with 38°C (100°F) common in some areas.

Mosquito bites should be prevented at all costs in the far north, where they have many bug repellents, from lotions to sprays, as well as citronella candles, and 'espirales' (a spiral shaped incense). These are purchasable at most kiosks (kioskos) or pharmacies.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Respect"]},"\nSuccessive peso crises have left many Argentines bitter towards some authorities and institutions. While many shops will appreciate payment in US dollars or euros and even offer you a better exchange rate than the banks, try to blend in elsewhere. Keep a supply of pesos on hand for those businesses that do not accept dollars.\n\nAs of Jan 2014, it is difficult to obtain US dollars. They can no longer be obtained through the automated teller machines. In order to receive dollars for pesos, the official agencies require a receipt from an Argentinian bank (for the amount of pesos), an official form of identification, and a copy of the individual's ATM\/bank card. Damaged bills or those larger than a USD20 are very undesirable and may be declined.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Conversation"]},"\nArgentines are very engaging people who may ask very personal questions within minutes after first meeting someone. They will expect you to do the same. Failing to do so would signify lack of interest in the other person.\n\nDon't be offended if someone calls you a \"boludo\". Even though it's a swear word, to Argentines it means \"pal\", or \"mate\" (depending on the tone it is said), it is said they talk about 100 boludos per hour (100b\/h). Argentinian people are infamous for the amount of cursing they do, so if they are talking to you don't pay attention to the cursing. If Argentinians are mad, teasing you or making fun of you, you will tell by the expression of their face or the tone of their voice as well as even more cursing than usual.\n\nAlso, don't be offended if an Argentinian says things to you in a very direct manner: this is very usual among locals and sometimes offends foreigners. Argentinians are very emotional and extremists, both when telling good things or bad things to anyone. You'll also see that they have an acid humour, make fun of themselves in every aspect, and sometimes they will make fun of you. Just reply back with another joke if this is the case; locals won't take it as an offence.\n\nTaxi drivers (especially old people) are very friendly and usually very well informed about everything. Feel free to talk about whatever you want. Some of them even know lot of history and politics of the city.\n\nTry not to compare \"dulce de leche\", pretty women, soccer, birome (bic pen), and public bus, unfavourably with anything else in the world, likewise for Argentinian meat; doing it will be considered insulting.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Greeting"]},"\nCheek kissing is very common in Argentina, especially in bigger cities, among and between women and men. People make contact with right cheeks, and make a light \"kiss sound\" but not touch the cheek with their lips (only once, two kisses -right and then left- is very rare). When two women, or opposite sexes first meet, it is not uncommon to kiss. Two men will first shake hands if they do not know each other, but will probably kiss when departing, especially if they have spoken for a while. Male friends cheek kiss every time when greeting, it is like a sign of trust. Trying to shake hands when offered a kiss will be considered odd, but never rude especially if you are an obvious foreigner. Remember when visiting another country its always interesting to try new customs.\n\nIn the rest of the country, regular handshaking applies. Also women will greet by kissing as described above, but it's reserved to other women and to men they are acquainted with. All the aforementioned applies elsewhere in Latin America and in the Iberian Peninsula (except the man to man cheek kissing, which is not common elsewhere).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Football"]},"\nSince some Argentinians are extremely die-hard football fans, try to avoid wearing rival soccer jerseys, as one bad turn on the wrong street, or walking into a bar wearing the wrong colours, could be dangerous in low-class areas. You can wear European football club jerseys with an Argentinian player's name on the back (for example: a Manchester City jersey with Tevez's name, a Barcelona jersey with Mascherano's name, etc.). If you really want to wear a jersey, the safest plan is to wear an Argentina World Cup jersey.\n\nArgentine \"barrabravas\" (An equivalent of the term \"hooligans\") cause various degrees of vandalism, assault, and deadly shootings in a few occasions due to football debates. It is recommended not to wear local football clothing too often, and you will be better off if you avoid using football clothing altogether.\n\nThe ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Perú"]]}," national football colours (and jersey design) are almost identical to those of local team River Plate, so be cautious as to avoid misunderstandings.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Punctuality and perceptions of time"]},"\nArgentinians generally take a relaxed attitude towards time. This can be unsettling to visitors from North America and non-Latin parts of Europe where punctuality is highly valued. You should expect that your Argentine contacts will be ",{"type":"''","value":["at least"]}," 10 to 15 minutes late for any appointment. This is considered normal in Argentina and does not signify any lack of respect for the relationship. Of course, this does not apply to business meetings.\n\nIf you are invited to a dinner or party at, say 21:00, it does not mean that you should be present at 21:00, but instead that you should not arrive before 21:00. You'll be welcomed any time afterwards. Arriving to a party one hour late is normally OK and sometimes expected.\n\nThis attitude extends to any scheduled activity in Argentina. Plays, concerts usually get going around half an hour after their scheduled times. Long distance buses leave on time though. As in any busy city around the world, short-distance public transportation like city buses and the subway do not even bother with time estimates; they arrive when they arrive! Factor these elements into your calculations of how long things will take.\n\nDelayed bus or train departures are not uncommon, especially in big cities. This is normally not a problem, as in general no one will expect you to be on time anyway. However, long-distance bus departures almost always leave on time (even if they arrive late), so do not count on lack of punctuality to save you when arriving late at bus terminals.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Things to avoid"]},"\nAvoid talking about the \"Falkland Islands\" (",{"type":"''","value":["Las Islas Malvinas"]},") including the Falkland War and dispute, with their English name. These are very sensitive subjects to many Argentines and can cause a strong reaction and an unpleasant situation for you.\n\nAvoid wearing any English and British symbols due to the above mentioned reasons. English and British flags as well as English national football (soccer) tops (who are rivals of the Argentine national football team during the World Cup) are definitely to be avoided. Although no assaults on people wearing them have been recorded, people might be very upset about them and you are very likely to receive very icy looks and treatment from the population.\n\nAlso avoid talking about the Perón years and also about politics, the military junta and religion in general. These are very sensitive subjects to many Argentines and can cause a strong reaction as well.\n\nAvoid comparing Argentina with its neighbours Brazil and Chile, because they are considered rivals especially in the economic sphere.\n\nAvoid comparing regional foods. This too can be a sensitive subject, as recipes and key ingredients vary from province to province.\n\nAvoid asking for ketchup for anything other than a hot dog. There's fantastic beef in this country, and asking for ketchup, or barbecue sauce, then pouring it on a steak can easily get you kicked out of a restaurant.\n\nSame sex marriage is legal since 2010, but in small towns, or the more conservative north of the country, some people (especially older generations) might be shocked by public displays of affection.\n\nDrug use, while legal in the country, is frowned upon by most inhabitants. Alcohol is generally the vice of choice here. Paco, a crack-like mix of by products from the cocaine manufacturing process, is a serious problem, and its users should be avoided at all costs. These people are undeniably violent and unpredictable.\n\n'Villas' or ghettos, usually composed of wooden or steel plate shacks, should also be avoided due to the high crime rate in these areas.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By phone"]},"\nYou can get a prepaid Movistar \/ Claro \/ Personal SIM card for a few pesos \/ free at phone shops, all you pay is about ARS20  (about USD5) for your initial credits.
