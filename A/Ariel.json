It quickly grew during the 1980s and became a formative garrison settlement, equidistant between the Mediterranean Sea and the Hashemite Jordanian border, thus providing tactical awareness of the Northern Territory to the Israeli Army, allowing for threats emanating from Nablus and most Palestinian inhabited places of the West Bank to be countered. It today contains around 8,000 Russian Immigrants, many of whom are not Jewish by Jewish religious law. The rest are Israeli and predominantly secular, although more traditional than the coastal secular communities. Around 20% of the town's population are classed as Orthodox Israelis, with minute numbers of Haredim. It is also home to a large public college and an important industrial area called the Barkan, producing many Israeli kosher food exports in particular. The settlement's residential\/commercial growth has been slow and relatively unsuccessful, due to its secular nature, low birth rate as well as its alienation from the main economic\/cultural\/religious life of the Israeli coastal plain. Strategically, along with the presence of a large population of Israeli settlers and the army to guard them, Israeli-only access via checkpoints, curfews and arbitrary military law imposed on the Palestinians, settlements such as Ariel control areas of West Bank overlooking the heavily populated Israeli Central Region.\n\nIt has a population of 25,000, including permanent non-resident students.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By Bus"]},":\n\nFrom Tel-Aviv Central Bus Station, buses 86, 186 and 286. 86 is the express bus, bypassing other Israeli settlement communities.\nFrom Rosh Ha'Ayin North Train Station, Bus 100.\nFrom Jerusalem Central Bus Station: Bus 148 (Egged).\n\n'''By Car\":\n\nFrom Tel-Aviv: Drive towards Herzliyah via Motorway 20 and take a rightward turn at Route Five.
