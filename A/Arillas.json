It has a big, sandy beach and a great view over the Diapontia islands, off the coast of Corfu. It is a tourist resort but there are no big hotels and development is low-key. Almost all hotels, restaurants, bars and shops are run by their local owners and this makes it feel like a village. After a few days in Arillas, people will recognize you and maybe even call you by your name!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nArillas is 37 kilometers to the north-west of Corfu Town.

Arillas is a perfect base for a walking holiday. In 2012 a footpath was cleared and marked by the local people that takes you up some impressive cliffs to Magoulades and back down again over a totally different route through orchards and fields full of flowers. The footpath is 8 km long and more footpaths are in the planning. Apart from the explicitly marked footpaths there are many more that are unmarked but easy to follow. In fact, there is a network of footpaths covering the whole island of Corfu. For more info on footpaths check out the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.corfuwalks.com\/ Corfu Walks"]}," website.
