With a population of 210,000, yet a land area of only about 26 square miles, Arlington is one of America's mostly densely populated jurisdictions. Despite its density, Arlington mixes the best of both big city and suburban environments.\n\nArlington is frequently grouped together with the adjacent but politically independent cities of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Falls Church"]]}," to the west and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alexandria (Virginia)"],["Alexandria"]]}," to the south, forming the northern Virginia side of the metropolitan core \"inside the Beltway\" (i.e. in the area encircled by Interstate 495). These areas, like the greater Washington area as a whole, have seen considerable economic and population growth as the size of the federal government and its contractors continues to grow, even during nationwide economic downturns. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Districts"]},"\nArlington is broadly divided into North Arlington and South Arlington, separated by Arlington Boulevard (US-50). You can often tell what section a location is in by its address. Locations in North and South Arlington will often have, respectively, a \"North\" or \"South\" (or \"N\" or \"S\") before the street name (e.g. 1234 S Example St, Arlington, VA).\n\nArlington has several different commercial districts of interest to the visitor.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["North Arlington"]},"\nThe high-rise ",{"type":"'''","value":["Rosslyn-Ballston"]}," corridor follows Wilson and Clarendon Boulevards west from ",{"type":"'''","value":["Rosslyn"]},", just across the Potomac from Georgetown, through the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Courthouse"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["Clarendon"]},", and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ballston"]}," neighborhoods. The Metrorail Orange Line parallels the area, serving five stations. The largest concentration of restaurants and bars is found in this area, particularly in the Clarendon neighborhood, which was Arlington's \"downtown\" until the 1960s.\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Columbia Pike"]}," corridor, centered on Columbia Pike east of Glebe Road, is an up-and-coming district, with the county government aiming to increase density and to construct a controversial streetcar line. For now, the Pike is served by frequent Metrobuses connecting it to the Pentagon Metro. In recent years, a number of new bars and restaurants have opened, joining the longtime Arlington Cinema & Drafthouse.\n\nAccessed mainly via I-395 (the Shirley Highway), ",{"type":"'''","value":["Shirlington"]}," is a mixed use development with a variety of restaurants as well as art and event space, and of course shopping. \n\nThe small western neighborhood of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Westover"]}," has a selection of neighborhood restaurants along Washington Boulevard between North Mckinley and Longfellow Streets.

The Crystal City Metro station is on 18th St South between Route 1 and Crystal Drive. Located adjacent to the airport— indeed, one can walk from Reagan Washington National Airport directly into Crystal City via the Mount Vernon Trail— this neighborhood has perhaps the largest concentration of hotels in Arlington.\n\nArlington has been redeveloping 1960s-era Crystal City, with a new restaurant district along Crystal Drive joining the established one on 23rd St S. Underlying it all, literally, is the Crystal City Underground, a subterranean network of interconnected shops and restaurants— and a handy alternative to walking in bad weather, provided you don't get disoriented.\n\nAdjacent to Crystal City to the north is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Pentagon City"]}," shopping district, served by the Pentagon City Metro station, and just across I-395 from the Pentagon. The neighborhood is dominated by three shopping centers: the Fashion Centre at Pentagon City, with higher-end shops, and connected to the Ritz-Carlton hotel; the Pentagon Centre to its east; and Pentagon Row to its west, home to a wintertime skating rink. Proximity to the freeway as well as the numerous eating and shopping options make Pentagon City a regular stop for bus tours.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Rosslyn Panorama 00092.jpg"],["550px"],["thumb"],["Rosslyn's skyline, viewed from D.C."]]},"\n\nArlington and \"Old Town\" Alexandria form part of the original \"ten miles square\" which the U.S. Constitution dedicated as the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Washington, D.C."],["District of Columbia"]]},", the nation's capital. It was one of the District's original two counties; Arlington County (named Alexandra County till 1920) was the part on the Virginia side of the Potomac River, and Washington County (present day Washington, D.C.) was the part on the Maryland side. The law creating the District prohibited building government buildings in Arlington County, leaving it to be used for gambling and other vices. In the 1840s, as a result of issues relating to congressional representation, slavery, and the economy, the U.S. Congress returned Arlington County to Virginia.\n\nWhile no longer part of the capital proper, Arlington's proximity to it has made it home to various national monuments and federal installations.

Many people detailed on business to the Washington DC area stay in Arlington. If you will be in Arlington for longer than two weeks, but less than six months, a long stay hotel (also called a corporate apartment) is the best place for you. The ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.aafsw.org\/dc\/apts\/apts_main.htm Associates of the American Foreign Service Worldwide"]}," publishes internet reviews of many corporate apartments. When choosing a corporate apartment, consider its location carefully. Apartments very close to the metro are considered highly desirable; some buildings further away operate shuttle services. Other considerations include the frequency of maid service, if pets are allowed, parking facilities, and if the neighborhood has good restaurants, stores and supermarkets in easy walking distance. The Ballston neighborhood has all of these and is home to several corporate apartments including the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.meridianballston.com\/ Meridian"]}," and the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.archstoneapartments.com\/Apartments\/Virginia\/ClarendonBallstonRosslyn\/Lincoln+Towers\/?cid=250 Lincoln Towers"]},". Do inquire about price, and make sure the pricing structure is compatible your per-diem guidelines.\n\nIf your stay in Arlington will be longer than six months, you are probably better off renting a regular apartment from through a broker, the Washington Post classifieds, or an online site such as Craigslist. Most Arlington landlords are familiar with the transient nature of government work and will include a \"government escape clause\" or \"diplomatic escape clause\" in your lease if you ask. Such a clause states that the lease can be terminated without penalty upon 30 days notice of receipt of government or military travel orders.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Reagan Terminal B-C.JPG"],["thumb"],["270px"],["The main terminal at National Airport"]]},"\n\nArlington is a very safe county with considerably less crime than its neighbor, Washington, D.C. While you are unlikely to be the victim of a crime here, you should take normal precautions that you would in any urban area, such as keeping your car and hotel room locked at all times. If you have a problem, dial 911 to contact the Arlington Police.\n\nBe aware that the Metro closes at midnight from Sunday-Thursday and at 3AM on Friday and Saturday nights. The time of the last train is posted in each station. Metro buses operate longer hours, but on a greatly reduced schedule outside of rush hour.
