It is here that the biblical mountains of Ararat (and today's eponymous cognac brand) can be found. Armenia became the world's first Christian country in 301 AD.\n\nVarious vassal states, principalities, kingdoms and empires rose and fell in different parts of this highland during history. They were unified once, just before the time of Christ, in the empire of Tigran the Great, which stretched from the Caspian to the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nMuch of the region's history has since been spent under the dominion of whichever great power was ",{"type":"''","value":["à la mode"]}," at the time: Romans, Byzantines, Ottomans, Persians, Russians and Soviets have all come and gone.

The Armenians' religious autonomy was bought through their higher taxation. However, relations soured in the late nineteenth century which saw various massacres of Armenians.

The Christian Armenians on the Ottomans' Russian border were considered liable to side with Russia and so they were treated as an enemy. The Ottomans attempted to kill or deport the entire Armenian population. Even the Ottomans' defeat in 1918 did not prevent the continuation of the persecution which continued until 1923 and saw approximately 600,000 - 1.5 million people perish.\n\nThe genocide led to the huge Armenian diaspora community that exists all over the world today and the ongoing diplomatic hostility between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Turkey"]]}," and Armenia.\n\n",{"type":"=====","value":["Soviet Armenia"]},"\n\nAs all over the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Soviet Union"]]},", Armenia saw great industrial growth and widespread increases in education.

There was zero political freedom. Anyone thought to harbor anti-Soviet thoughts was sent to die in the Gulag. Arbitrary borders were drawn between Armenia and Azerbaijan and so set the stage for a conflict which runs on today.

One should definitely try them and will never forget the taste of Armenian apricot, peach, grapes, pomegranate, etc. Especially the watermelons in Armenia and neighboring countries with similar altitude and climate are of superior taste.\n\nArmenian bread is very tasty as well. There is a wide range of different types of bread, starting from black and white till lavash (a soft, thin flatbread) and matnaqash.\n\nDon’t miss trying milk products! Along with ordinary milk products, there are some traditional and really tasty and refreshing ones. Matsun (yogurt) is a traditional Armenian dairy product that has centuries of history. It contains a number of natural microelements, which have high biochemical activity. It’s really refreshing, especially when you try it cold during hot summers. Okroshka - cold soup with kefir and cucumber and dill; it is a healthy and refreshing dairy product. Spas is really tasty hot yogurt soup with grains in it.\n\nCafé culture rules in Armenia, and the best places to have a cup of coffee and people-watch are sidewalk cafés. Any place near the Opera is certain to be jumping late into the summer nights. A popular chain is \"Jazzve\" (several locations throughout the city, including near the Opera and off Mesrop Mashtots Avenue), which offers many varieties of tea and coffee as well as great desserts.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nAlcoholic: Vodka, tutti oghi (mulberry vodka), honi oghi (cornelian cherry vodka), Tsirani oghi (apricot vodka), local beer (Kilikia, Kotayk, Gumri), wine (can also be made of pomegranate), and brandy.\n\nOther: Tan (yogurt combined with water and salt), Jermuk (mineral water), masuri hyut (rose hip juice),  chichkhani hyut (sea buckthorne juice), bali hyut (sour cherry juice), Armenian coffee, and herbal teas.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nAcross Armenia, you can find bed and breakfasts that are pleasant and will give you a true taste of Armenian culture. The language barrier will be significant in the rural areas of Armenia if you do not speak ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Armenian"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russian"]]},", but if you take a phrase dictionary with you, you should have no trouble, as people are patient. If you don't personally know any Armenians, one way to access the true Armenia, away from the Westernized hotels and \"Armenian branded\" hotels is to find a reliable travel agent based in Armenia.\n\nIn Yerevan, there are a couple of hostels. Outside Yerevan, there are a few main recreational areas that offer very reasonable accommodations, but you will be required to live without some conveniences. At the high end are some hotels on Lake Sevan and in Northern Lori Marz (50 kilometers from the Georgian border). Here you will miss nothing, but you will pay Western prices for the accommodations. Around Lake Sevan, there are numerous types of cottages and hotels. Prices are reasonable and start at about $10 per day for a cottage with electricity and within walking distance from Lake Sevan. The city of Sevan, due to its proximity to Yerevan, is the most popular place on Lake Sevan but the history, culture and non-Western feel of the accommodations change as you go south on Lake Sevan.\n\nTavush Marz is a wonderful place to summer. Dilijan and Ijevan are wonderful towns in which to be based, with day trips to the many ancient churches that pepper this remote region. Costs are very reasonable and Dilijan is known for its sanatoriums from the Soviet era. Do not expect hot water all hours of the day, but you can have a lovely room that will accommodate a family, including food for about $20 a day. Take another $20 to hire a car for the day to visit the surrounding historical sites.\n\nLori Marz is the second most beautiful region after Vayots Dzor. It has many health resort areas such as Stepanavan, Dendropark (Sojut) next to village Gyulagarak. Lori is considered to be the Armenian Switzerland. It has numerous churches, monasteries, medieval bridges and monuments. The Stepanavan area is great for hiking, tasting fresh dairy products, etc. Small hotels and B&Bs are available in the area of Stepanavan, Odzun, Tumanian, etc.\n\nTzaghkadzor is a well-known winter retreat. It has many lovely hotels and is popular year round. Check with a travel agent to find the best deal depending on what activity you are looking to undertake. Jermuk, made famous by the bottled water of the same name, is a wonderful get away, but will again require you to leave your western expectations behind.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Learn"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Armenian phrasebook"],["Armenian language"]]}]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["history"]},".

Theft and pickpocketing are not unheard of, particularly targeting foreigners; utmost care is essential. Use common sense when walking on the street at night, especially after drinking.\n\nFemale visitors should be aware that unaccompanied women are an unusual sight after dark. In the outskirts of the city, a single woman walking alone at night may attract attention.\n\nThere are also people at the Zvartnots airtport who ask you if you need a taxi. They escort you to one of them and claim that they are airport taxis which cost two or three times more than regular taxis. Never trust those people, even if they have already put your luggage in the trunk! You can find a taxi which costs 2000-3000 AMD instead ~10 000 AMD they are asking. That's definitely a scam and many tourists have fallen into that trick.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\nIf you are dining with Armenians, they will feed you until you cannot eat any more. The food is generally safe, even from the roadside khorovats stands.\n\nThe tap water is generally safe, as it comes directly from mountains, but you may also purchase bottled water. You can get both mineral water with gas and normal spring water on almost every street corner. This water is available in both the rural areas and the capital.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Smoke"]},"\nSmoking is illegal in many public places.

Although widely taught at school for years, the Soviet Union officially recognized the genocide of the people of one of its republics in 1965.\n\nOne can find out more about the Armenian Genocide by visiting the Genocide Memorial 'Tzitzernakabert'. There is also a museum near the memorial.\n\nHaving been liberated by the then-Russian Empire in 1916, Armenians are partly Slavophiles; ask as many questions as you like about soccer and Soviet TV programs. Respect is generally shown for Slavs, including Russians. People often have no problem talking about the Soviet Union. Most Armenians do not mind if you speak to them in Russian even if it is their second language.\n\nIt is very common to give up your seat for an elderly passenger on the public transport. Usually, men will give up their seat to woman too. It is also considered polite to let women first to the bus or train or to enter a room, and the \"ladies first\" rule is considered important.\n\nWhen visiting churches, both men and women are expected to dress modestly (i.e. no shorts, miniskirts, sleeveless shirts\/tops etc.). Lighting a candle is always a nice gesture, but it is optional. You should always talk quietly when you are visiting a church.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\nYerevan is full of internet cafes and internet phone offices. These are beginning to pop up in a number of towns outside of Yerevan as well. International calling is available through prepaid mobile phone cards. Short-term mobile phone rental is also possible.
