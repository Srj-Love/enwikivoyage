The winters are very cold, with snow sometimes falling in the winter months and overnight temperatures below freezing.  The old English-style gardens in the area blossom in Spring, as the firs, willows and oaks in town and in the University of New England grounds sprout new leaves.  In Autumn, the town celebrates the changing colours of the trees with an Autumn Festival, which includes a street parade down the main boulevards.  But it is summer that is arguably the best time to visit Armidale.  Due to its altitude, the town is rarely humid, and even days where the temperature reaches 35°C are tolerable.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Tourist Information"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Armidale Visitor Information Centre"],["url=http:\/\/www.armidaletourism.com.au"],["email=tourism@armidale.nsw.gov.au"],["address=82 Marsh Street Armidale"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=next to Hungry Jacks Restaurant"],["phone = +61 2 6772 3888"],["tollfree="],["fax=02 6771 4486"],["hours=7 days from 9AM to 5PM"],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nArmidale is one of the main centres located on the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New England Highway"]]},", an inland route that links the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hunter Valley"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sydney"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brisbane"]]},".\n",{"type":"{|","value":[["class=\"wikitable\""],["|+ ",{"type":"'''","value":["Driving distances\/times"]}],["|-"],["!
