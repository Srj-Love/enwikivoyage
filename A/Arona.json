It is also connected to the railway network, being one of the main stops in the important link between Milan and Switzerland that passes Domodossola (another parallel link travels through Como). Arona is also the last station for two minor rail lines, connecting Arona to Novara and Santhià; the latter uses single-car diesel trains.\n\nArona is near a confluence of motorways, and from there one can head for Milan, Genoa, and Gravellona Toce (where the motorway becomes a simple highway to Domodossola and continues into Switzerland). Whereas there is a motorway exit named after Arona, the exit at Castelletto Ticino is usually more convenient for the traveller coming from the direction of Milan.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nArona is the southernmost port on Lake Maggiore, and transportation by boat or hydrofoil is available to both sides of the lake up to the Swiss city of Locarno.\n\nDue to the town's size there is no public transport, but some bus companies connect the town to its frazioni of Dagnente, Campagna, Mercurago and Montrigiasco, and to neighbouring municipalities.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Sancarlone"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat=45.7703"],["long=8.5433"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=This giant statue of Saint Charles Borromeo was commissioned by Cardinal Federico Borromeo, and construction began in 1614, completed in 1698.

It is said that the architects behind the Statue of Liberty consulted the blueprints of the Sancarlone when laying out their own. The statue was intended as part of a complex of buildings and chapels celebrating the life of St. Charles, of which only three chapels were completed. Next to the statue are the 17th Century basilica and the former Archbishop's Palace.
