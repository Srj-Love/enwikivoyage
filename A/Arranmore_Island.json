[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Arranmore Island"]}," is an island in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["The Rosses"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["County Donegal"]]},". It is the largest inhabited island in County Donegal, and the second largest in all of Ireland, with a population of 528 in 2006, down from 543 in 2002, and over 600 in 1996. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe island lies 3 miles off ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Burtonport"]]}," and can be accessed by ferry boats that run daily all year.  There are two larger ferries that can accommodate vehicles up to 128 feet long in addition to foot passengers, as well as a smaller \"fast ferry\" which can accommodate only foot passengers.  Travel time on the larger ferries is around 15-20 minutes, while the fast ferry travels from port to port in about 5 minutes. The two larger ferries are owned by separate companies and as such, if you travel to the island on one boat, you must return to the mainland on the same vessel or you will be charged twice. As of Summer 2009, the current rate per person is €15 and can be paid either at the ticket office in Burtonport or while on the ferry in-transit.  However, if you travel to the island during after hours, the price will likely be higher and can cost €50.\n\nIf you leave your vehicle behind at the Burtonport pier, parking is limited, but free.  On a particularly busy day, it is possible that you may be \"boxed-in\" by other parked cars if they do not leave you enough room, so plan accordingly.  While no official security for parked cars is provided, the parking area is within close view of both ferries when they are docked and locals and ferry operators alike will not allow suspicious behaviour to go unquestioned.\n\nThe trip to the island affords spectacular views, passing a number of small islands before crossing a stretch of open Atlantic water.

As a result Arranmore lacks a large number of land animals which might be familiar to anyone living on the Irish mainland. Birdlife is not restricted by the sea and the absence of many of their natural predators means they can live and breed with relative ease on the island. This is reflected in the large number and variety of birds seen every year.
