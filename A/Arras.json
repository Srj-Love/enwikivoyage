Both main squares measure 17 000 sqm. The town's two great squares are quite splendid providing a collection of 155 unique façades of Flemish baroque architecture. In 1492 Arras had become part of the Spanish Netherlands and this helps explain the style of the architecture (Arras was only retaken by the French in 1640 at the time of Louis XIII). These large town squares were originally designed to accommodate large markets which in different periods contributed largely to the prosperity of the city."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["L'Hôtel de Ville & Le Beffroi d'Arras"]}," - The ",{"type":"''","value":["Hôtel de Ville"]}," (Town Hall) on the ",{"type":"''","value":["Place des Héros"]}," (and not the ",{"type":"''","value":["Grand' Place"]},") was destroyed during the war but has been recreated in its original style. The dominating belfry (beffroi) is 77m high, or 326 steps and offers a great view of the city of Arras. Building had begun in 1463, but it was a century later in 1554 before the work was completed (by comparison the ",{"type":"''","value":["Hôtel de Ville"]}," took just four years to construct). The belfry was built in Gothic style. A 2m tall statue of the golden lion holding the sun can be found at the top of the bell tower. It was installed under Louis XIV (hence the sun found in its paws). The statue found at the top of the belfry is the reproduction of the original which sits in the Museum of Fine Arts in Arras (the original being damaged due to the bombings during WW1). During this period, the belfry was destroyed and it was rebuilt later, just as it had originally been with a concrete structure by the chief architect of historic monuments Pierre Paquet along the town hall of Arras. The belfry is a historical monument. Since 2005, the belfry of Arras is listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in category: Belfrys of Belgium and France. The local Tourist Information Office is situated in an office on the left as you go in and it is open every day except Christmas and the New Year. Below, in the basement are the underground chambers - the Boves. These can be visited on tours, and give a glimpse of an area used by the British army as a field hospital. The Boves are still used today by the locals and some sections have even been turned into restaurants. During the war they were used for sheltering soldiers and afterwards the returning towns people took refuge there whilst they rebuilt their shattered town."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Les Boves"]}," - The Boves of Arras are a collection of underground chambers (galleries connecting individual cellars) that men have gradually dug since the tenth century. The existing network is of remarkable length and excellent condition. These quarries were dug when local builders used great blocks of chalk to build the town's most important buildings. These tunnels were also used as shelters by the Arrageois during times of war, invasions, bombings... These undergrounds were also used by the British during WW1 to install a small hospital. Columns of sandstone or limestone pillars support the vaulted halls and stairways that allow residents to store food in the cellars at constant temperature of 11 °C, which, as some of you may know, is ideal for wine storage!"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Les Carrières Wellington"]}," - The Wellington Quarry is an attraction in Arras relating to the Battle of Arras in 1917. This network of underground tunnels played a major role in taking the enemy lines and helped save the lives of many soldiers. Miles of tunnels were dug beneath the Arras countryside to create command posts, kitchens, sleeping quarters and even a hospital, protecting around 24,000 Allied troops. The Wellington Quarry is located about 700 meters behind the SNCF railway station of Arras, in the direction of Bapaume.
