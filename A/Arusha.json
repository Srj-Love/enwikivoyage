Avoid taking motorcycle taxis, especially at night in front of clubs. Thieves easily use this opportunity to rob people. \n\nIn the city centre (on Sokoine road) and in certain areas (along old Moshi road) there are frequent attacks on tourists, especially when they are walking with their backpacks\/bags. Make sure that you take a cab when you are arriving\/leaving from Arusha (as gangs usually know when and where backpackers arrive) and avoid taking a bag when walking in town. \nForeigners are virtually guaranteed to be approached by touts. This can be intimidating, especially when they latch onto and follow you, but they are usually harmless. In this case do not stop, slow down or make eye contact; simply say \"hapana asante\" (no thank you) if they ask or offer you anything. You will save yourself a lot of bother if you do not engage them. When walking in any part of the city beyond the central district, it is advisable to take a guide. The bridge on Old Moshi Rd is a particularly notorious mugging spot, and although often patrolled by police it should be avoided if on foot.\n\nIn 2013 and 2014 Arusha has been experiencing a number of bomb attacks.
