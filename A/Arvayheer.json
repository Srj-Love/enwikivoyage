The ride typically lasts at least 6-7 hours, and tickets must be purchased a day or two in advance. Bus tickets from Ulaanbaatar to Arvayheer cost approximately 20,000 tugrug, around US$13.89 (based on current exchange rate of 1440 MNT). There is paved roads the whole way.\n\nThere are also microbuses that run between Ulaanbaatar and Arvayheer. These are often very cramped (four across a bench seat), as drivers want to fit as many people in as possible to maximize profit. If possible, it is not a bad idea to pay for an extra seat to be left empty.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Gandan Muntsaglan Khiid"]},{"type":"*","value":["High street"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nJust north of Arvayheer is the Orkhan Valley and the ruins of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Karakorum"]]},", former capital of the Mongol Emprire.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Central Mongolia"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Arvaikheer"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["46.266111111111"],["102.77777777778"]]}]
