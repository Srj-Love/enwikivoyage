It was made famous in the 1970s by musicians such as Bruce Springsteen, Bon Jovi, and Southside Johnny.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nAsbury Park was founded as a Christian retreat in the 1800s by a man named James A. Bradley. It remained one of the most popular family resorts in the United States until 1970, when race riots burned down much of the downtown area.\n\nSoon radicals, beatniks, hippies, and musicians moved in, making Asbury Park a very diverse place. In 1988, the city had had about enough of its new cultures, and a plan to redevelop the entire waterfront went into affect. Most businesses were ordered to be closed, so the boardwalk, casino, hotels and amusements all closed for the redevelopment. High rise hotels and condos began construction, but were then abandoned before they could be finished, leaving the waterfront an odd mix of abandoned buildings and rotting construction.\n\nThe city declined in the 1990s, after almost all businesses failed. Crime rose, and Asbury Park had higher crime than any other town in Monmouth County.\n\nHowever, in 1998, Shep Pettibone converted an abandoned Hotel into a gay nightclub, drawing thousands of gay travelers to Asbury Park. Every Friday night the city became the only place on the East Coast that could rival Fire Island! Gay couples and artists began buying cheap homes, abandoned bars and nightclubs, closed storefronts downtown, and abandoned pavilions on the boardwalk, and restoring them to they way they once were.\n\nToday, Asbury Park is popular amongst even mainstream tourists for its shopping, beaches and restaurants. Major summertime events hosted in Asbury Park include; the Wave Gathering, the Gay Pride Parade, Garden State Film Festival, Asbury Park Jazz Festival, \"Road Trip\", and the Tri-City Arts Tour.\n\nAsbury Park was recently rated #5 in the top ten beaches of NJ.
