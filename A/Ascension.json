The British garrisoned the island in 1815 to prevent a rescue of Napoleon from Saint Helena and it served as a provisioning station for the Royal Navy's West Africa Squadron on anti-slavery patrol. The island remained under Admiralty control until 1922, when it became a dependency of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saint Helena (island)"],["Saint Helena"]]},". During World War II, the UK permitted the US to construct Wideawake airfield on Ascension in support of trans-Atlantic flights to Africa and anti-submarine operations in the South Atlantic. In the 1960s the island became an important space tracking station for the US. In 1982, Ascension was an essential staging area for British forces during the Falklands War, and it remains a critical refuelling point in the air-bridge from the UK to the South Atlantic.\n\nThe climate on Ascension Island is subtropical.  It is arid and lacking in vegetation until the elevation increases where lush forest and fertile soil exists.\n\nThe main settlement is Georgetown where the tourist information office is in the Obsidian Hotel (see Sleep).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:SH-Ascension.png"],["thumb"],["right"],["upright=1.9"],["Map of Ascension Island"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:ASCENSION ISLAND - FT.

There are also some beaches and ocean swimming in certain coves, such as Comfortless Cove and English Bay. Long Beach, as inviting as it looks, has a very hazardous undertow and is not suitable for sea bathing. However, it is a sheer delight for wildlife fans as this is where sea turtles go to nest. There are a few paths (such as Rupert's Path) suitable for hiking into the more lush highlands, as well as mountainside lava tubes to explore. The British pastime of letterboxing - hiking to a destination that contains a \"letterbox\" containing a log book and a rubber stamp pad - is possible here.\n\nAscension Island features what was at one time reputed to be the world's worst golf course. Located between the settlements of Two Boats village and Georgetown, the course has 18 holes and the greens are in fact 'browns', a reference to the sand and oil mix used to make them. The rest of the course is made up of volcanic ash and rock, which makes for some interesting rounds.\n\nThere is some terrific Scuba Diving in the waters surrounding Ascension Island.
