Ashford officially became a market town in 1243 and by 1600 had risen to become an important market town, primarily for livestock.\n\nAshford is in the center of Kent, and was one of the first towns in Kent that drastically changed into a highly developed town with modern standards. Ashford International was opened on 28 February 1996 and first operated trains from France terminating at Waterloo, London. Now trains terminate at St Pancras International in London. The town also has an airport with regular flights to France. The towns name derives from the combination of two words.

However, UK customs checks take place on arrival in the UK.\n\nPassengers travelling to France\/Belgium from Ashford International go through French passport\/identity card checks in the station before boarding the train, whilst selective customs checks take place on arrival in France\/Belgium following disembarkation.\n\nAshford International is also served by domestic trains from several major London stations (see below).
