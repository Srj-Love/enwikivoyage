Some believe that the town resembles northern Italy or Switzerland, with snow covered peaks in the winter, a lake not too far away in the valley, and a nice, small-town, community feel that is oh-so-rare these days in the States.\n\nThere are two main business districts: one downtown, centered on the Plaza and running southwest along Main Street toward the library. This old-fashioned boutique shopping area is home to many amazing restaurants.  In fact, you'll have a hard time finding a bad meal. Connected to this area is 93-acre Lithia Park ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cr.nps.gov\/nr\/travel\/ashland\/lit.htm\/"]}," which was designed in part by John McLaren (also the designer of San Francisco's Golden Gate Park) in 1914.

Ashland has a limited number of drive-through permits, and thus fast food joints. Wendy's, Taco Bell, Subway and other chains are still open in Ashland.\n\nOutside of the business districts, Ashland offers a host of outdoor attractions.
