It is also a nice getaway resort area away from the congested Cleveland, Buffalo, and Pittsburgh metro areas about 50-150 miles west, east, and southeast of Ashtabula county. Ashtabula is located along Lake Erie and is prone to the local weather patterns from the lake. Lake Erie bring a pleasant cool breeze in the summer but cold snowy conditions in the winter. Ashtabula county falls within the snowbelt region and gets a good amount of lake effect snow activity during that season. Snow can be fairly deep and travel conditions during that season can be fairly hazardous. If traveling to this region during winter keep that in mind. The snowfall can be rather beautiful and opens up the recreational potential to cross country skiing, sled riding, and ice skating.
