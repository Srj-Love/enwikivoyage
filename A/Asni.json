From there, a ",{"type":"''","value":["grand taxi"]}," will take you to Asni costing 15Dh per person, 6 sharing. DO NOT pay more than maybe 25Dh per person. (Grand taxis are maybe not the way, if you don't like sharing very confined spaces with strangers: the official policy is to seat 4 people in the back, and two people on the passenger's seat.)). Don't get ripped off taking a taxi straight from the airport!\n\nAlternatively, if you are staying at Kasbah Tamadot (Sir Richard Branson's luxury hotel), private transfers are available from the Marrakech airport to the resort bookable through Virgin Limited Edition.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nAsni describes both the small village where the grande taxis drop you and the wider valley, however if we just consider the village: It is split into two parts. The 'commercial' area, down by the main road. Here there are shops lined up on either side of the road. Behind the shops up a slope to the south(?) a short distance is the 'residential' part of the village, consisting of 50 or so houses.\n\nObviously walking on foot is the way to get around (as the village is only a few hundred metres wide).\n\nA old green Mercedes-Benz minibus shuttles between Asni and Imlil all day long (from 7am onwards). Wait at the taxi area until someone shouts \"ImlilImlilImlilImlilImlil!\". It should cost just 10 dirhams (August 2008 prices): Don't get ripped off. A taxi shouldn't cost that much more (about 15Dh to Imlil; about 30Dh to Marrakech). If, as a tourist, you're quoted a price in the 100s of dirhams (this happens), say it's too expensive and walk away. You'll instantly be called back and asked to name your price: they will still want your business even if they can't rip you off.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThis village has little to see. Old mud-brick houses seem amazing the first time you seem them, but you'll see more, higher up in the mountains, without all the touts and conmen. Compared to Imlil and Marrakech, Asni is noticeably less touristy and therefore is more like the 'real' Morocco whilst still offering all the amenities needed to stay there. It is, however, neither as picturesque as Imlil nor better located for visiting the Atlas. If you are looking for a base from which to explore deep into the Atlas, Asni's a bit too far north.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nFor many people there's little to do here beyond buying food and water, and leaving.\nOkay, that's a bit harsh.

They'll invite you to their house, give you lots of mint tea and sell you an excellent but massively overpriced meal (50Dh each for cous-cous). I was hustled by these guys (Muhammed and Muhammed) who although were friendly and spoke good English, became really pushy when they got out the inevitable \"silver\" bangles. They spend all day waiting around the cafe opposite the petrol station. Perhaps it's just how they make a living, but it's easier to not get too involved with them. Sunglasses allow you to avoid making eye-contact.\n\nThe weekly market (Saturdays) is big. Traders travel for hours and hours to get there.

There are 2 showers to use free of charge, and the water's perfect in the evening after being heated by the sun during the day. There's a delightful selection of 4 squat toilets in the outhouse (bring your own toilet paper). For water, there's a tap outside and another in the 'kitchen' to get fresh, drinkable water (I drank it neat for several weeks and was OK). Also in the kitchen is a sink and a massive table (but no means to cook anything if you don't bring your own stove). Ask Omar nicely to use his freezer. There's a large garden area with plenty of shade under a canopy of trees, outdoor lighting, and plenty of garden chairs knocking about to sit on.
