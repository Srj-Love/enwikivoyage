The southern third of the island runs into ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Virginia"]]},", and is managed by the Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge. It is completely uninhabited, and open only to daytime canoe\/kayak and foot visits.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nAssateague Island National Park was established in 1943. The island has 14,000 acres of beach, a forest, as well as saltwater marsh and freshwater marsh habitats. This habitat is home to migratory birds, plants, and of course wild ponies. There are many different theories to how the ponies got to the island; some say  they are survivors of a shipwreck, but there is no evidence to support this. Others say that someone put the ponies over on the island so that they could avoid fencing laws.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\nMore than half of Assateague Island National Seashore’s 48,000 acres is comprised of near-shore and estuarine waters, and the interplay between these waters and the barrier island affects nearly every aspect of life in this dynamic coastal environment.\n\nThe geography of the island itself is in a state of constant flux, continuously being reshaped by the elemental forces of wind and water.  Powerful storms can dramatically alter the shoreline in a matter of hours, as waves wash over the beach and reshape the island from ocean to bay.  Other forces sculpt the landscape in less obvious ways.  Exposure to salt spray, lack of fresh water, and isolation from the mainland are subtle, but powerful influences on the Island’s species composition.  Over time, these conditions have produced a community of plants and animals uniquely suited to the extremes found at the edge of the sea.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Sunset over the Assateague wetlands.jpg"],["thumb"],["260px"],["A sunset on the bayside wetlands looks beautiful, but bring bug repellant!"]]},"\n\nWhile Assateague’s wild horses are perhaps the island’s best-known inhabitants, other large mammals also roam the park, including the native white-tailed deer (",{"type":"''","value":["Odocoileus virginianus"]},") and the non-native sika deer (",{"type":"''","value":["Cervus japonica"]},"), a diminutive species of Asian elk introduced to Assateague during the 1920s.\n\nOther inhabitants are less conspicuous than the large mammals.  Seven species of frogs and toads depend on fresh water ponds in the center of the island for breeding, and a variety of snakes, such as the black rat snake (",{"type":"''","value":["Elaphe obsoleta obsoleta"]},"), can be found across the forests, dunes, and marshes preying on rodents, small birds, or toads.   Numerous invertebrates such as fiddler crabs (",{"type":"''","value":["Uca"]}," ssp.) and mud snails (",{"type":"''","value":["Nassarius"]}," ssp.) play key roles in maintaining the health of the island’s salt marshes.  Even the seemingly barren beaches provide habitat for nocturnal ghost crabs (",{"type":"''","value":["Ocypode quadrata"]},"), red fox (",{"type":"''","value":["Vulpes vulpes"]},"), and raccoons (",{"type":"''","value":["Procyon lotor"]},"), who scavenge the crustaceans, fish, and other organic matter washed in by the tides.\n\nMany bird species make their home on Assateague on a seasonal basis.  Shorebirds by the tens of thousands depend upon the island’s protected foraging and resting areas during their twice-yearly transcontinental migrations.  Each fall, large flocks of waterfowl such as snow geese (",{"type":"''","value":["Chen caerulescens"]},") begin arriving at Assateague where they will spend the winter traveling between the sheltered bay and salt marshes and fallow farm fields on the mainland.\n\nFinally, the coastal waters that surround Assateague Island teem with animal life.  The sheltered, nutrient rich waters of the estuary formed by the island provide ideal breeding and spawning habitat for many aquatic species, some of which, like the blue crab (",{"type":"''","value":["Callinectes sapidus"]},"), are commercially important to the local area.  Each spring a variety of fish, including spot (",{"type":"''","value":["Leiostomus xanthrurus"]},"), Atlantic menhaden (",{"type":"''","value":["Brevoortia tyrannus"]},") and summer flounder (",{"type":"''","value":["Paralichthys dentatus"]},") migrate into the estuary to breed.  Later, the juvenile fish provide an abundant food source for birds, marine mammals, and larger fish.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nSummers are generally hot and humid, albeit less humid than inland.  It rarely snows in the winter but there is often a damp cold. At any time of year, come prepared for potential high winds, and always for intense and unrelenting, inescapable sun!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nDriving is the only practical way for individual travelers to get to the island (although it is very bicycle friendly). Coming from the west on US-50, take the exit for US-113, turn left on Assateague Rd at the light, then right on MD-611, which will terminate on the island. From Ocean City, take the exit from US-50 directly on to MD-611 S.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\n",{"type":"''","value":["See ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Sleep"]]}," for details on camping fees"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["National Park"]},"\n\nEntrance fees are $3 for individuals on foot or $15 for private vehicles.

There is also parking by the National Park's boat launch, as well as the Life of the Forest and Life of the Dunes trails. Parking by the campsites is strictly restricted to campers with permits.\n\nThe park service allows ",{"type":"'''","value":["Over Sand Vehicles"]}," (OSVs) to drive on the beach with a seasonal permit (predominantly used by locals), which unfortunately will spoil any thoughts you had of a pristine walk on an unspoiled beach, or for that matter, peaceful, isolated beach camping.

This lighthouse is now only open a few times a year for tours.\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["wildlife"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["wild ponies"]}," are without a doubt the star attractions. Bird watching is one of the more popular activities in Assaeague, but most people come to see the wild ponies. There are different theories to how the ponies got to the island: some say they are survivors of a shipwreck, but there is no direct evidence of this. Others say that someone put the ponies over on the island so that they could avoid fencing laws. To catch the ever popular pictures of the ponies walking by the surf, the ponies favorite beach times are early morning around sunrise, late afternoon, and sunset. Around mid-Day, the ponies are more easily found either by the road, poking around the campsites, or a little less often on the marsh side of the island. Ponies seem to love to go in the middle of the road after dark... You are a lot more likely to see them in the National Park than the State Park.\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["beaches"]}," are spectacular--huge white sand beaches on the Atlantic, unmarred by any buildings in any direction. (Although the beach is thoroughly marred by all the OSVs once you go south of South Ocean Beach.) Lifeguards are present during swimming season at the main section of the State Park's beach, and at North Ocean Beach in the National Park. The National Park beaches are lifeguarded only on holiday weekends, and from mid-July to the end of August. The water tends to be a little bit rough, but still OK for swimming. One of the more fun walks is to head north of the main swimming area in the State Park towards the northern tip of the island (and indeed, it does come to a narrow sandbar, where you can stand, surrounded by surf. This area is notionally and unofficially \"clothing-optional,\" but it's rare to see anyone actually disrobe.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nAside from the obvious swimming, taking a walk along the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Life of the Dunes"]}," and the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Life of the Forest"]}," trails in the National Park is highly recommended. You will learn a lot about barrier island ecosystems in the process (especially if coupled with a free visit to the National Park Visitor Center on the mainland side of the Verrazzano Bridge). They are also fabulous opportunities for wildlife viewing and photography. A colorful sunset over the marsh on the bayside of the forest trail is unforgettable.
