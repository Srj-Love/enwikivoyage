Assisi, being an old roman town, had its own temple dedicated to Minerva, the goddess of wisdom. With the arrival of Christianity the temple was transformed into a Catholic church and the Virgin Mary was promoted above pagan wisdom. The church was completely remodeled in the early 1990s and stands in stark contrast to the exterior.  In Piazza del Comune you find also the Tourist Information Center.

After a short while you pass an archway and arrive to \"Via San Francesco\". A little walk and to your left you will see a little chapel called the \"Oratorio dei Pellegrini\" (the Pilgrim's Chapel).
