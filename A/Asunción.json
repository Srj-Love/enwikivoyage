Although use of the Internet for such things is limited in Paraguay, you can find a number of apartments and houses for rent on Clasipar ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/clasipar.paraguay.com\/zona\/asunci_n_212\/categoria\/departamentos_21.html"]},". The majority of properties are not furnished, and lessees generally seek one-year leases; however, comfortable furnished apartments in the centre can be had for between 1,000,000 and 1,500,000 Gs per month. Make sure you get a receipt for the deposit specifically (insist if necessary; claim you won't rent without one) or you probably won't get it back.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nNational police has a highly visible presence, some already decked out in riot gear as if an uprising would be forthcoming at any moment. Because the dictator in the 80's did not tolerate crime in any form crime is not prevalent. Although the perception of crime is that it runs high since the dictator's fall in 1989. Some houses are protected by twenty foot high walls topped by barbed wire and electric fence or razor wire, and those who can afford it, have a full-time guard on their grounds. Despite the locals' rather high perception of crime, Asunción is one of the safer capitals in South America and violent crime is very uncommon. Due to the low numbers of tourists in Paraguay in general, visitors are not likely to be specifically targeted by criminals. Key things to watch out for are petty thieves (watch your pockets on crowded buses) and taxi drivers trying to rip you off (make sure they use the meter). Pickpocketing is said to be prevalent in crowded downtown streets near expensive hotels.\n\nProstitution is rampant and obvious after dark on the main avenues in the outskirts and in small parts of the city center's oldest parts near the port. Transvestite prostitutes are common around many areas, and are best avoided as they are known to cause trouble occasionally. Female travelers should be aware that they will receive a lot of unwanted attention from Paraguayan males -this is mostly intended as innocent banter in the form of shouts or wolf whistles etc., but can sometimes be accompanied by touching, especially in clubs. This sort of attention is best just ignored. Liquor is easily available but not widely abused, there are a fair few street drunks in some parts of the city, but they are invariably harmless.\n\nBe extremely careful when crossing streets in Asunción.  Most drivers consider stop signs and traffic lights to be merely suggestions, even if police are nearby.  Buses will stop for almost nothing, so be very careful.\n\nThe United States CDC recommends that all visitors to Asunción receive a typhoid vaccination prior to travel.  Dengue fever is frequently a risk one takes when traveling to Asunción; unfortunately, no vaccine for this currently exists.  To avoid insect-spread diseases, ensure that you use bug spray at all times of the day, without exception.\n\nThe \"Chacarita\" area by the river, next to the Palace is an extremely impoverished and dangerous part of the city, and is definitely not a place to go exploring.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\nInternet places are everywhere and usually cost between 3,000 and 5,000 Gs. per hour. Connection speeds are usually good. If you're travelling with a laptop or Wi-Fi enabled phone, it's relatively easy to find open Wi-Fi signals. Many restaurants have free Wi-Fi.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=CyberKing"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=corner Oliva and 14 de Mayo"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Open 24h - more or less"],["price=5.000 Gs\/h with Skype"],["content=A good place for Internet and one of the only ones open late as well."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\nFlies, ants and especially ",{"type":"[[","value":[["mosquitoes"]]}," (but no large, creepy bugs) are everywhere. There are no screens, windows and doors are simply flung open for ventilation. Air conditioners do exist but most people depend on less expensive fans. Heaters do not exist, though on the chilliest days they would be welcomed. The soil is bright red and as many streets are unpaved dust becomes a problem. There are trees (some in the middle of roads!) for shade, but palm trees are planted everywhere. Dogs and farm animals of every description are all over the roads. There is no humane society to care for wild dogs and some are pitifully mangy. It is not uncommon to see pigs wallowing in a mud puddle in the middle of a road, chickens are everywhere, horses, donkeys and cows run loose and can be found in anyone's property.\n\nIt is brutally hot in Paraguay's summer. If you've ever wondered why Latin culture has a \"siesta\" where everything closes down at noon for a few hours, you'll soon know why if you spend time in Asunción during the summer. You'll also understand why people eat dinner so late and stay out partying all night: it's too hot during the day to enjoy being outside.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Embassies"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["Republic of China"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Republic of China (Taiwan)"],["url="],["email="],["address=MCAL.
