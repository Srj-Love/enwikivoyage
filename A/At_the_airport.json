But while it may feel that airports force you to walk the vast majority of the way towards your destination, this article should help expedite and ameliorate your passage through any airport: from check-in to duty-free checkout.\n\nThis part of the guide offers extended tips for that part of your journey by air between the entrance door of the airport terminal until the time you board your aircraft.\nMost international airport terminals are standardised, with similar procedures for check-in, security, immigration and customs, however, it's still worth considering the particular quirks of your point of departure. Wikivoyage has articles about ",{"type":"[[","value":[[":Category:Airport articles"],["many individual major airports"]]}," worldwide, whilst a simple internet search should be able to provide any additional information that you may need for your trip.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nIf you want to reduce stress get to the airport at least an hour before the recommended minimum check-in time.\n\n(Check with your airline for recommended minimum check-in times. This can be as little as 30 minutes for domestic flights from regional airports in countries such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Zealand"]]}," that do not have security screening to as much as 3 hours for an international flight to or from the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["US"]]}," where the security theatre can be extensive and time consuming. This extra hour will also give you a buffer for delays on the way to the airport.)\n\nIf for some reason you are delayed and you're worried about missing your flight or the flight status indicates that you are in danger of missing your flight, find a member of your airline's staff or talk to staff at the security gate. If you are really in danger of missing your flight, they can arrange for speedy check-ins and for you to be moved up in queues.  But they won't notice if you don't tell them. Calling for late-passenger instructions while you are on your way to the airport can also help.  The plane will not wait for you; but it might wait if you're one of 50 connecting passengers on a delayed flight.\n\nEspecially in cities which are served by more than one airport, you must know the name of the airport and the specific terminal within that airport you are departing out of.  Keep in mind that if you arrive at the wrong airport, it can take an hour or so to go to the correct airport.  Terminals can also be far away from each other so be sure to be at the right terminal too.  The name of the airport as well as the terminal you will use are detailed in the itinerary prepared for you by the airline or travel agency.\n\nWhen asking the taxi driver to take you to the airport, don't just mention the city name and then the word airport (e.g. London Airport), mention the name of the airport and the terminal (e.g. Heathrow Airport terminal 5).  Keep in mind that an airline may operate from more than one terminal, particularly if it has domestic and international flights so telling the taxi driver you want to go to the terminal where a particular airline operates may not be enough.\n\nIf you are asking for airport limousine\/shuttle service, giving the flight number is usually all the telephone operator needs as they know which airlines fly out of which terminal.\n\nThe same cautions apply if you use rail service to reach your airport.  Some airports have such an array of terminals that metro lines, subways or railways may have more than one station.\n\nYou need to arrive at airports well before your flight as there are a number of procedures you need to complete before boarding: check in, security check, and perhaps immigration control. Airlines will typically have departure boards (displays) indicating a flight's status. The most important status indicators are ",{"type":"'''","value":["Boarding"]}," or ",{"type":"'''","value":["Go to gate"]},", which is a sign that you should promptly complete check-in and proceed through the security check, and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Final call"]}," or ",{"type":"'''","value":["Last call"]},", which means that you should board the flight as quickly as possible.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Check-in "]},"\nChecking in consists of three main parts, which used to be performed at the same time but can now be done separately:\n# The actual check-in, i.e. confirming to the airline that you will take the booked flight and the airline should expect your arrival and, possibly, look for you should you not arrive at the gate on time (depending on specific airline policies)\n# Handing in your hold luggage to ground handling staff, who will appropriately tag it and take care of it on its way to your airplane's luggage hold\n# Getting your boarding pass to enable you to continue further\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Checking in "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Aeroporto de Brasilia.JPG"],["thumb"],["280px"],["Check in at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brasilia"]]},"'s airport"]]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Traditional check-in "]},"\nThe first thing you will need to do at the airport is ",{"type":"'''","value":["check in"]}," for your flight. Present your ticket (if you don't have an electronic ticket) and some form of ID (passport if travelling internationally) to airline staff at your flight's designated check-in counter or at the common check-in counter, depending on your airline.\n\nCheck-in is handled by the carrier's ground staff or its representatives.\n\nYou will typically have to ",{"type":"'''","value":["queue"]}," before check-in: on very full flights and very busy days this alone could take more than an hour, particularly for international flights.  There are usually separate, and much shorter, check-in lanes for first, business class passengers, upper tier members of the airline's frequent flyer program (e.g. silver, gold) and sometimes those who checked-in through remote methods (e.g. online check-in). If the queue is long and your flight is leaving within the hour, your flight status is already showing \"Go to gate\" or you are approaching the check-in deadline for your ticket, let airport staff know as they will often allow you to go to the front of the queue and check in immediately. Sometimes they will specifically ask for passengers for a flight that is about to close to make themselves known so that they can check them in right away, but sometimes they will not. Discount airlines have the strictest check in deadlines and some will not allow you to check in after the deadline even if you made it to the end of the queue in time.\n\nIf you have to check-in manually, be prepared for longer queues.  Have your documentation ready before you get to the counter.  If other methods of check-in are made available, avoid using the traditional check-in counters unless you have special requests.  Some carriers already charge a fee for using traditional check-in counters.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Online check-in "]},"\nCheck-in for domestic flights can usually be done on the airline website up to 24 hours in advance of departure.  If you have no baggage to check you can just proceed directly to your gate and flight with your printed boarding pass.  However, some carriers insist that they inspect and verify your travel documents before allowing you to go through security. If you have hold baggage to check, drop it at the bag drop lane. Removing old route tags from your bag before proceeding to the bag drop will speed up this process and avoid redirection.\n\nA good number of carriers also offer checking-in via mobile phone either by visiting the mobile website or downloading a specific app on your smartphone.  At the end of the process, some carriers may give you the option of being issued a mobile boarding pass depending on your origin and destination, though carriers that offer them usually don't do so for international flights.  You don't need to print your mobile boarding pass, just present it to security staff.\n\nSome airlines allow (or sometimes require) you to check in ",{"type":"'''","value":["online"]},", often within 24 hours before scheduled departure, and some no-frills carriers such as Ryanair will even charge you a hefty fee if you fail to do so. Online check in can often be done through the airline's website, or sometimes by smartphone app. Apart from the booking reference or e-ticket number you also identify yourself by frequent-flier or credit card number or by giving personal details.  Upon completed check-in you will often be sent a boarding pass to print out by yourself; again, failing to do so may result in surcharges from some low-cost carriers. If you enter the correct information but are denied check-in, your flight may have been cancelled or the reservation may have been modified by the airline; in that case it is wise to contact the airline immediately, preferably before traveling to the airport.\n\nIf you can't check-in on-line, the check-in kiosks at the airport are much the same, and issue a boarding pass for you. You then need to go to the bag drop if you have more than carry on luggage.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Automated check-in at the airport "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Aeroporto di Firenze - Alitalia ticket machines.jpg"],["250px"],["thumbnail"],["right"],["Alitalia's automated check-in kiosks at Firenze Airport"]]},"\nAn increasing number of airlines are implementing a ",{"type":"'''","value":["self-check-in"]}," system at certain airports.  In most cases this option is available to passengers with or without check-in bags.  These systems involve small kiosks in which you can enter your booking reference, swipe\/insert the credit card used to make the booking or swipe\/insert your frequent flyer card (if it has a magnetic strip) to access your record and print out a boarding pass for you and your traveling party.  You may have the opportunity to change your seats when checking in; in particular, many airlines do not open the exit rows until the day of the flight.  In recent times though the self-service check-in kiosks of some carriers have been extended to include features that allow passengers to check-in baggage by themselves.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, if you checked-in via kiosk or online, the airline usually provides a special lane for you where the rest of the check-in process will be expedited.  At this counter, please provide the information and documents that were given to and\/or requested of you.  Some carriers require passengers who used self check-in to proceed to designated check-in counters to have documents verified, even if they do not have check-in bags.\n\nElectronic check-in is possible only in routine cases; if there are special needs or inconsistencies with the tickets (such as mismatches with names), only manual check-in at the counter is possible.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Dropping hold luggage "]},"\nSome airports offer curbside check-in, which allows you to check-in your bags before entering the terminal.  These are normally available on domestic US flights and do what the standard check-in counters inside do except that they will not issue boarding passes to you.  You will have to obtain them inside if you haven't done so from online check-in.  Curbside check-in is offered nowadays for a fee levied by the carrier, sometimes on top of prevailing check-in baggage fees.  Moreover, tips for the staff are expected.\n\nThe check-in staff will print a bar-coded luggage tag once your bags are processed; the longer part of it will be attached to your luggage while the shorter part will be given to you.  Keep this, as upon arrival, some airports may require passengers to present these along with their luggage to ensure that the person carrying the luggage is indeed the owner.  These luggage tags are also useful if you suspect some of your check-in luggage is missing or similar to other luggage.  Before the ticket agent attaches the new luggage tags for your upcoming flight, be sure:\n",{"type":"*","value":["  You've removed any old airline tags."]},{"type":"*","value":["  Your new tag(s) reflect your destination airport...checked-through as below."]},"\nIn case your journey for the day involves several flights, you may want to request to have your baggage ",{"type":"'''","value":["checked-through"]},".  Check-through is when your baggage will be tagged all the way until the last leg of your journey and in most cases, you do not need to claim your baggage in your intermediate stopovers anymore (especially for international-international or domestic-domestic flights on full-service carriers; does not apply to international-domestic connections).  You need to inform the check-in staff of the flights which will be covered by check-through for a particular journey as they can't assume that's your preference.  However, check-through is ",{"type":"''","value":["not always"]}," possible, make sure you inquire of the check-in staff.  You may check the section \"Making a connection\" below and are advised to contact the carriers concerned for more information on when check-through may or may not be possible.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Excess baggage"]},"\n\nIf you find you are taking more baggage than allowed, check with the airline to see what the cheapest way of carrying it is. Sometimes additional baggage allowances can be pre-purchased, especially online where discounts may be given. Excess luggage fees are heftier if the excess weight is detected at the airport than if pre-arranged and pre-purchased.\n\nMany airlines offer discounted cargo rates to passengers, but this must be arranged prior to departure, and destination of the goods your want to ship as cargo must match the destination on your ticket.  You will need to deliver your excess bags to the cargo terminal, and you may incur duties and other charges.\n\nPostal services or sea freight can be ",{"type":"''","value":["much"]}," cheaper than air freight or excess baggage charges.  But check rates thoroughly.  It may be a good way to get some baggage back home when you don't need it any longer, or even to send some baggage ahead for longer trips.  However, see individual country listings for information on reliability and shipping times of such services.\n\nLuggage delivery services provide an alternative. Luggage is delivered by a specific date, normally between 48hrs and 5 days, with door-to-door service to an address you specify.  You don't have to go to the cargo terminal before or after you drop-off or pick-up your checked luggage.  All paperwork is provided to you and customs procedures are managed.  The price is cheaper than airline cargo rates, but still expensive.\n\nIf you have a lot of baggage, consider flying business class or even first class. Domestic tickets may not cost that much more. International flights will cost considerably more and may not be recommended. With most airlines, those seat classes will allow you to get a larger luggage allowance.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Boarding pass "]},"\nThe flight ticket itself does not enable you to board the plane; for this, you need a ",{"type":"'''","value":["boarding pass"]},". ",{"type":"'''","value":["Check-in"]}," is the process of producing your boarding pass, which includes seat numbers, departure times and gates. In the security check, only passengers with boarding passes are admitted in. You can often do the check-in yourself electronically, either online or with check-in kiosks at the airport. Check-in is not to be confused with ",{"type":"'''","value":["baggage drop"]},", which requires prior check-in.\n\nWith some airlines you will receive a ",{"type":"'''","value":["boarding pass"]}," with a seat assignment, while some do not assign seats. You will need a boarding pass to present to the security staff and later to the gate staff when boarding the flight. At this time, your checked luggage will be weighed, labeled, and handed off to baggage handlers.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Overbooking "]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["To volunteer or not to volunteer?"],["In most cases, if a flight is overbooked airline staff will first ask for volunteers to take another flight. In some cases, volunteers will receive slightly better benefits than persons involuntarily removed from a flight. Such benefits could include more monetary compensation, a bump in class, or a discount granted for a future flight. However, if you are traveling as a group you may be split apart and seated throughout the airplane or even in separate classes on your new flight(s). Additionally, you may be required to make more flights than planned (ie your overbooked flight from Paris to Atlanta may become flights from Paris to New York and New York to Atlanta.  If the compensation offered is for future travel, consider if you are flying with that airline in the next 12 months."]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Overbooking"]}," is the practice of accepting reservations for a flight from more people than can fit on the plane. Almost all airlines overbook their flights, as statistically some percentage of passengers do not show up for the flight.\n\nIt does happen, though, that more people check in than can fit on the plane. When this happens, the airline staff will ask passengers to volunteer, either at the checkout counter or after the plane is full, to remain behind and take another flight.  If your travel plans are flexible (such as on the homeward leg of your excursion), you may wish to volunteer, to receive the compensation that airlines usually offer to get out of this predicament.  If there are no volunteers, passengers will be chosen by the airline to stay behind. \"Bumped\" passengers are almost always offered passage to their destination by some other route or on a later flight; it is common for airlines to offer a voucher for a substantial discount on a future flight, or even cash, in compensation for the inconvenience.  If an overnight stay is required, the airline will usually pay for a hotel and meals during the delay. Your rights are regulated at the country level; some airlines may offer additional compensation (but their policy on this is rarely published).  Sometimes they will increase their offer for volunteers if the initial offer does not get enough interest.\n\nIf you want to avoid being bumped you should get seat allocation as soon as possible.  Sometimes a travel agent can do this when reserving your flight, sometimes you can do it electronically with your reservation or by checking in early on the Internet before arriving at the airport.  If you have no seat allocated to you then you are at risk of being bumped at the airport, even if you arrive a long time before other passengers who may already have seats allocated.\n\nCompensation for denied boarding for flights in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Europe#Denied_Boarding"],["European Union"]]}," is €250 for distances less than 1500 km, €400 for distances between 1500 and 3500 km, and €600 for distances greater than 3500 km (half if the delay is less than 2, 3 or 4 hours, respectively) in addition to an alternative flight or a refund of the ticket.  Consult your travel agent or the airline.  If inquiring of the airline by telephone, ask for the current ",{"type":"'''","value":["load factor,"]}," which is the ratio of reserved seats to capacity.  Anything greater than one indicates an overbooked flight, while your chances of boarding as a stand-by passenger decline as the load factor increases.\n\nYou may face the same challenges in lines\/queues for the personal security screening.

If a flight is cancelled, the airline is obligated to get you on the next available flight to your destination, but interpretations of \"next available\" vary and, for some low-cost carriers like Ryanair, this may mean a long wait indeed.  With flights operated by European Union (EU) carriers to or from the EU, passengers are entitled to cash compensation of 250 Euros and more after a delay of 3 hours or more - unless the delay is for circumstances beyond the carriers control.\n\nBe aware that unusual weather can cause the very strange phenomenon of being denied boarding because of weather for a flight that, nevertheless, does depart on schedule.  This is usually caused by weight limits and takes two forms:\n\n# Predicted weather may make the flight longer, and so more reserve fuel is mandated.  Most planes can't take a full load of passengers and full fuel; if they must fill the tanks more than expected, they might have to leave some people behind.\n# As it gets warmer the takeoff roll increases (the air is less dense and so decreases wing lift as it slightly decreases engine thrust) but the runway doesn't get any longer.  If the air temperature gets hot enough, they may have to reduce weight for the plane to get safely in the air.\n\nAirlines never unnecessarily cancel or delay flights; it costs too much, in money, perturbs many other flight schedules, and generates poor public relations.  When they do delay or cancel, they usually go to great lengths to arrange seats on another flight, sometimes even on another airline.  If a cancellation has been caused by them, they are required by law to pay you certain compensations and\/or arrange lodging and\/or meals until you can be flown to your destination.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Waiting"]},"\n\nAfter you pass through security you'll usually be able to reach one or more departure areas or wings of the terminal.

Enforcement of this is lax, and many times the aisles become overcrowded.  Regardless of the boarding order given, you are always free to remain in the boarding lounge until the final call for the plane.  If you choose to spend the least time possible in a cramped aircraft cabin, just wait in the boarding lounge until you see the last person at the gate, and join the end of the queue.  Just remember, the boarding gates close 10–15 minutes before departure and no announcements will be made outside the gate area.\n\nMost airlines will attempt to find passengers who are late for boarding, because for security reasons they have to go through the time consuming process of unloading checked baggage if passengers do not board.  Usually they will page late passengers by name at least twice before closing the flight. If you hear your name paged, either go to the gate immediately if it's nearby or find airport staff and let them know who you are if you are not yet close to the gate. They can usually get you there before you're locked out of the plane. However, delaying a flight will not make you popular with staff or fellow passengers!  Once they have made the decision to offload your bags, usually no amount of pleading will see you get on that plane.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["ombox"],["type=custom"],["image=",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:BSicon FLUG.svg"],["link=Flying"],["30px"]]}],["text=<span style=\"color:black\"> Done?
