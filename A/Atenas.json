The ultimate time of year in Atenas is in the winter months of January-March, when there isn't much rain.  The temperature is warm, hovering around 20-25 degrees C, but with constant winds blowing cool breezes over the hills of Atenas.  This is a favorite spot for expats from North America and Europe, as the climate is so comfortable, there is easy access to fresh fruits and vegetables, and the town has much less crime than in the capital, San José. The rainy season in Atenas is still pleasurable, as the weather is just as warm, with perhaps one hour of rain in the mid-afternoon.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nIt is easy to access the city-center by bus from anywhere in the surrounding area. There are buses that make rounds every couple hours, and one can ride the whole circuit for CRC420 (less than USD1).  Taxis are another easy and cheap option, as they line up in front of the main street in Atenas, and can take you 20 minutes away (the outskirts of Atenas) for around CRC2,500 (or USD5).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThe center of town boasts an open bench-filled park, shaded by huge palm trees.
