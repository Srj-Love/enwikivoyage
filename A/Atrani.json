It is the smallest comune in Southern Italy.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nAtrani was founded by the ancient Roman aristocracy, and became the residence of the most wealthy and powerful families of the Republic of Amalfi.  Unfortunately, the town suffered when Ruggero II and the Normanni domination began. This was only furthered by the Pisani invasion in 1337, which deprived the entire Amalfi Coast of its independence and political power.\n\nToday Atrani maintains its distinct fishing town atmosphere.  The main entrance to the town starts from the beach, and from there, the traditional houses climb up the steep mountain valley, intertwined with gardens and lemon terraces.  Atrani has little traffic and noise, even in summer, because it only opens to the beach and the sea.  This is probably the secret of its pleasant square, where a few bars and restaurants have opened.
