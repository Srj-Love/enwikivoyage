It could also be called the \"City of Volcanoes\". Much of its natural character comes from the fact that it is built on the Auckland Volcanic Field which consists of about 50 volcanoes. All of the volcanoes are individually extinct but the volcanic field as a whole is not.\n\nAuckland has the third best quality of life of the world's cities according to the Mercer Quality of Living Survey, and rates highly in other international quality-of-life polls. It features a large number of urban beaches and parks, numerous arts and cultural institutions and events, and is home to a multitude of sporting teams. There is also the city's love of sailing – 135,000 yachts and launches are registered in Auckland and several America's Cup regattas have been held here.\n\nAuckland is very multicultural, with strong immigrant cultures (40% of Aucklanders are born overseas). It has the largest Polynesian population of any city in the world. For some Polynesian island nations there are more expatriates living in Auckland than in their homeland. There is also a large population of New Zealand's native Maori people, and populations of immigrants and expats from Asia, the UK and around the world.

The service runs 24\/7 at 10 min intervals during the day (07:00–19:00) and 30 min during the night. After leaving the motorway, it alternates between two routes to the CBD, one via Mt Eden Rd, the other via Dominion Rd. Both run down Queen St, the main street of the CBD, and terminate at the ferry terminal, near Britomart Transport Centre. The trip takes 40–50 min. Fares are $16 one way or $28 return per adult, and $6 one way or $12 return per child. Multi-ride tickets and family passes are available. Tickets can be purchased either online, from ticket kiosks at the airport terminals, on board from the driver, or from selected hostels and i-Sites. You can use an AT HOP card (see ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Get around"]]},") for one way fares (but there is no discount).

The 380 Airporter runs to Manukau City Centre and to Onehunga. A cheap option to get to the CBD is to take the 380 Airporter to Papatoetoe Train Station, from where trains connect to Britomart station in the CBD. Paying cash this method will cost $4 + $6 = $10 to the CBD ($7.75 using a HOP card). Total time approx 20 min + 33 min + a short wait for the train. Ask for the bus stop at the infocentre.

There is a typical food court in the departures area before security, more café-style food after security, and a McDonalds and a coffee shop in the arrivals area. There is the usual collection of expensive shops and souvenirs on both sides of immigration. When arriving from overseas, you have to walk through a duty-free shopping area to reach baggage claim.\n\nWhen departing, you might want to avoid going to your gate until you are called: the gate lounges are dismal, and the waiting area upstairs is much more pleasant, with a nice view of the Waitakere Range and Manukau Harbour.\n\nLockers are available in the terminal for $15 per day.\n\nThere are short-term and long-term ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.aucklandairport.co.nz\/ToAndFromTheAirport\/Auckland-Airport-Parking.aspx carparks"]}," within walking distance of the terminals.

Use the ",{"type":"[","value":["https:\/\/at.govt.nz\/bus-train-ferry\/ Auckland Transport (AT) website"]}," to plan trips by public transport. AT also has a text messaging service that can be used to find the time of the next bus, ferry or train or to find the quickest way to get to your destination using public transport, as well as apps for iPhone and Android. If you wish to do a lot of cross-city travel, or travel outside the city, it may be more convenient to hire a car, though some city roads are congested at peak times.\n\nBritomart Transport Centre on the corner of Queen St and Customs St in the CBD near the waterfront is the main information centre for public transport. You will find free bus, train and ferry schedules there – which is handy since the frequency of some services is low and sometimes irregular. Timetables can also be downloaded from the AT website.\n\nThe AT HOP card is a prepay smart card for travel on bus, train and ferry services that costs $5. It gives a 20% discount off single trip adult cash fares, except for Airbus and NiteRider buses and Waiheke ferries.  Bus and train fares are measured in stages: one stage is $2 cash or $1.60 HOP; two stages is $4 cash or $2.95 HOP; three stages is $5 cash or $4 HOP; four stages is $6 cash or $4.80 HOP (as of July 2014).\n\nFor frequent travel on buses and trains, monthly passes can be loaded on a HOP card. These give unlimited bus (except Niterider) and train travel in defined zones. You must tag on and tag off each trip. A pass for a single zone costs $140, for two adjacent zones $190, and so on. Zone A covers the central Auckland isthmus, extending to New Lynn in the west and Otahuhu in the south. \n\nA Discovery Day Pass costs $16, and provides travel on all public transport, except Fullers ferries and the Airbus that runs between the CBD and the airport. It ceases on 1 August 2014.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:New Link Bus Auckland Hospital.jpg"],["thumb"],["A Link bus"]]},"\nBus is the most-used form of public transport. Buses to popular destinations usually run every 5–15 mins. For example, Kelly Tarlton's and Mission Bay buses (numbers 745–769) run at least every 15 min Monday to Saturday, though much less frequently Sunday.\n\nIf you don't mind a 5–10 min walk to a bus stop you can get by without a car. However buses are not always reliable, especially during peak hours. Delays of up to 15 min are common on some routes. Buses are a slow way to travel long distances, and travel is remarkably more difficult going across town than on a main north–south route. Consider taking a train or ferry where they are available. If you are travelling to less frequented areas or outer suburbs be prepared for long travel times and long wait periods (30+ min) between services.\n\nThe bus companies that run to different parts of Auckland are:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Central Auckland – Metrolink (includes the City Link, Inner Link and Outer Link), Urban Express"]},{"type":"*","value":[" North Shore (including Hibiscus Coast) – North Star, Ritchies, and Birkenhead Transport"]},{"type":"*","value":[" West Auckland – Go West, and Ritchies"]},{"type":"*","value":[" South Auckland – Waka Pacific"]},{"type":"*","value":[" East Auckland – Howick & Eastern"]},"\nThe Inner Link bus services the CBD and the surrounding areas of Newmarket, Parnell and Ponsonby – it is fairly frequent and costs up to $2 paying with cash or $1.60 with HOP card. The City Link bus runs in a circuit from Karangahape Rd\/Upper Queen St to Britomart or the Wynyard Quarter – it's free with a HOP card (as long as it doesn't have a negative balance) and otherwise costs 50c (as of July 2014).\n\nMost bus services run to and from the CBD, and there are relatively few cross-town buses. It might sometimes be faster (and more convenient) to take a bus into the city to take another bus out! If you want to get around the same area easily, you can take a bus to a hub that a lot of buses run through, to connect to another bus. The bigger bus hubs include (but are not limited to):\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Takapuna on the North Shore"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Bus stations on the North Shore"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Otahuhu in South Auckland"]},{"type":"*","value":[" New Lynn in West Auckland"]},"\nMost bus stops that are frequently used have displays showing the times the next buses arrive. These are fairly reliable but do not place all your faith in them – sometimes the signs display that a bus has come and gone, and then several minutes later the bus arrives.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Britomart01.jpg"],["thumb"],["A train at the underground platforms at Britomart station"]]},"\nTravel by urban train is a good option, but only if you are near a train line; there are few lines and not all suburbs are served. Services have improved in recent years due to upgrading of lines and many of the stations. Electric trains are being introduced in 2014 and 2015 to replace diesel trains.\n\nAn AT HOP card provides easier tag on\/tag off travel.\n\nThe three main lines are the Eastern, Southern (with Onehunga and Manukau branches) and Western lines. The Southern Line runs from Britomart station in the CBD, roughly parallel to the Southern Motorway, to Papakura, with a few services on to Pukekohe. It has very short branch lines to Onehunga at Penrose station, and to Manukau Central. The Eastern Line is a short line that runs from Britomart through four stations in the east of central Auckland before joining the Southern Line just before Westfield station, where the services continue to Papakura and Pukekohe. The Western Line runs from Britomart westward to Waitakere Station. There are no train services on the North Shore or in the suburbs east of the Tamaki River.\n\nThe Southern and Eastern lines have the most frequent and reliable services. Trains on these lines combined run every 10 minutes on-peak, 15 minutes off-peak and 30 minutes on evenings and weekends. Approximately 85-95% of these services run on time. Trains on the Western Line run every 15–20 minutes on-peak, every 37 minutes off-peak and every 30 minutes on weekends.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nThe road network experiences severe congestion at rush hour.  Geography constrains the network to a limited number of routes. Auckland has a comprehensive road network for a city its size, but lack of investment in public transport and geographic sprawl means it is largely dependent on private cars.\n\nIt is often easier and cheaper to hire a car instead of using taxis, simply because the city is so large and spread out. Auckland city is well covered by the main global car rental companies, such as Avis, Budget, Hertz, Thrifty and Europcar. All car rental companies offer competitive pricing for economy class vehicles and unlimited mileage options. Local car rental companies like Apex and Jucy may also offer competitive pricing.\n\nThere are three main motorway systems running through Auckland. The Northern Motorway (from north of Orewa to the Central Motorway Junction (CMJ) a.k.a. Spaghetti Junction) – note that it has a toll for the last few kilometres beyond Silverdale. The Southern Motorway runs from the CMJ past the Bombay Hills where it splits into State Highway 2 (SH2), and merges to the Waikato Expressway. The Northwestern Motorway runs from Auckland Port through CMJ to near Kumeu. These motorways clog up during the morning rush in the CBD-bound direction, and in the opposite direction during the evening rush. The Harbour Bridge has a method of mitigating this traffic load – it changes the lane system from 4-4 to 5-3, favouring the side which has the heavier traffic load. So be careful when crossing the bridge – some lanes will be available for you at one time but not another.\n\nWatch heading southbound over the Harbour Bridge – if you are heading to the Southern Motorway (e.g. to the Airport or Manukau), make sure you are in at least lane 3 (if not lane 4) before you reach the bridge to ensure you go over on the main bridge and not the clip-on lanes. Otherwise you will have only a few hundred metres after the bridge to cross two lanes of traffic to lane 4 before lane 1, 2 and 3 split off towards the city centre and the Northwestern Motorway. Inner lanes go to the CBD, middle lanes to West and the port, outer lanes South, but mind that the directions are not clear or timely and it is easy to head off in the wrong direction.\n\nSome motorway on-ramps have traffic lights operating in busy periods – they allow one or two cars to proceed every three to eight seconds to ease the merging onto the motorway. Cameras may be operating to catch red-light runners.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nTaxi fares vary considerably from company to company.
