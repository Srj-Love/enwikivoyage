She envisioned a town where unity will be celebrated and all will have a spiritual vocation. At the moment, in July 2010, 2200 people from 43 different countries are living in the city. About 40% are Indians (more than 15% are French and 15% are German).  \n\n",{"type":"''","value":["Auroville Handbook"]}," is the official guide to Auroville that can be bought in the Visitors' center and the bookshops around or Auroville's website.

It costs Rs. 1700 (apporox USD 38.00) (price quoted December 2010. If you call a taxi service in advance: +91-413-2622400 AV Transport, +91 413 2623200 Auro Cabs, +91 413 2623586 Om Travel (companies are run by Auroville township near Puducherry), they will be at the Arrivals exit with a sign with your name on it.\n\nYou can also rent scooters in Pondicherry and drive yourself for a day trip or arrange to keep the scooter for a few days or more.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nBest by motorbike, also possible by bicycle. Rickshaws and taxis can be ordered for trips out of the town. If you have a guest card than you can use the community's bus to Pondicherry (for free). \n\nYou can hire motorbikes for Rs 50-100 per day and in some guesthouses you'll get a bicycle for free or a small daily fee with your rent.\n\n\nAuroville is very spread out and large, so if you want to get around freely, rent a scooter or motorbike.\n\nThe challenging part is navigating the busier roads in around the village of Kaluipalayam, the largest Tamil village in or near Auroville. In addition to other motorbikes, you will encounter pedestrians, bicycles, cows, dogs, small tour buses, and the occasional ox cart loaded with hay. Traffic can be heavy at dusk, when the herds of cows head home and everybody else seems trying to get some place else.\n\nRemember to stay on the left and look both ways before turning or crossing a road. If you make a right turn, be sure to end up on the left side of your new road.\n\nThe nearest petrol station is on the sea front road (aka the Beach Road) just north of the Auroville turnoff. If you find yourself low while in Kaluipalayam village, a few of the shops have 1 liter water bottles filled with petrol for sale. Petrol goes a long way, but keep an eye on the level because running out can be very inconvenient and possibly unsafe.\n\nAlways travel with a charged cellphone, and know how to use it to call your moped supplier, your guest house, and your fellow travellers. Motorbikes have a way of breaking down or not starting, so it's better to travel in pairs or groups. That way you can always catch a ride on the back some someone else's bike.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Auro_049.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["300px"],["Savitri Bhawan"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Matrimandir"]}," - Meaning \"Temple of the Mother\" in Sanskrit, this is the geographical and spiritual heart of Auroville.
