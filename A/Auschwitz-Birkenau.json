The camps have become a place of pilgrimage for survivors, their families and all who wish to travel to remember the Holocaust.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n\n\nAlthough not the only (or, indeed, the first) German concentration and extermination camp, Auschwitz-Birkenau has become a widespread symbol of terror, genocide and the Holocaust in the global consciousness.\n\nA concentration camp was established by the Nazis in the suburbs of the Polish cities of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oświęcim"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brzezinka"]]}," which - like the rest of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Poland"]]}," - was occupied by the Germans from the beginning of the Second World War (1939) till it was liberated in 1945 near the war's end. The name of the city of Oswięcim was changed ('Germanized') to Auschwitz, as well as the name of Brzezinka - Birkenau; which became the name of the camp as well.\n\nThe camp was continually expanded over the next 5 years and ultimately consisted of 3 main parts: Auschwitz I, Auschwitz II-Birkenau, and Auschwitz III-Monowitz. Auschwitz-Birkenau also had over 40 sub-camps in the neighboring cities and in the surrounding area. Initially, only Poles and Jews were imprisoned, enslaved and murdered in the camp. Subsequently, Soviet prisoners of war ('POWs'), Romani\/Sinti (Gypsies), and prisoners of other nationalities and minorities were also incarcerated, enslaved and murdered there.\n\nFrom 1942 onwards, the camp became the site of one of the greatest mass murders in the history of humanity, committed against the European Jews as part of Hitler's plan for the complete destruction of that people ('the Final Solution'). The vast majority of the Jewish men, women and children deported from their homes all over occupied Europe to Auschwitz-Birkenau were sent immediately to their deaths in the Birkenau gas chambers upon arrival, usually trained in in overcrowded cattle wagons. Their bodies were afterwards cremated in industrial furnaces in the crematoria. \n\nAt the end of the war, in an effort to remove the traces of the crimes they had committed, the SS began dismantling and razing the gas chambers, crematoria, and other buildings, as well as burning documents. Prisoners capable of marching were evacuated into the depths of the German Reich. Those who remained behind in the camp were liberated by Red Army soldiers on 27 January 1945.\n\nA 2 July 1947 Act of the post-war Polish Parliament established the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum on the grounds of the two extant parts of the camp, Auschwitz I and Auschwitz II-Birkenau.\n\nThe site was added to the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["UNESCO World Heritage List"]]}," in 1979.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Barracones en Auschwitz II-Birkenau, Polonia5.jpg"],["thumb"],["Barracks in Auschwitz II-Birkenau"]]},"\nThere are quite frequent and inexpensive buses (11zl each way) or minibuses (8zl each way - depart from the basement level of the main bus station) to and from the main bus station in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Krakow"]]},", or guided tours are available from most hotels or tourist information centres. The bus takes about one and a half hours - it is usually busy and stops locally along the way. Also, trains regularly run to Oświęcim, you can purchase a return ticket for approx 45zl or one way for approx 23zl. A bus can then be caught to Auschwitz-Birkenau, or you can walk there (approx 1 km) in about 20-25 minutes. There is a shuttle bus between Auschwitz and Birkenau. It is free and goes every half hour (from Auschwitz to Birkenau it leaves on the hour at half hourly intervals and going the opposite way it is 15 minutes of the hour at half hourly intervals), or you can just walk the two miles between the camps (although it isn't a very nice walk as it is along the roads). If you've just missed a bus, a taxi between the sites will cost about 15 zl.\n\nLocal (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kraków"]]}," - 1hr30m) and international (e.g. Vienna, Prague) trains also stop at the nearby town of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oświęcim"]]}," (3km).

These tours involve a minibus pick-up from anywhere in Krakow, and a few hours guided tour.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Entrance"]},"\n\nEntrance is free, without a ticket, though donations are encouraged. Be aware that because of the large numbers of visitors entry to the Auschwitz-Birkenau I site is exclusively on a guided (and unfortunately rather rushed), group basis from 10AM to 3PM during the period from April 1 to October 31. Having a guided tour costs money (see below). You can visit the site on your own (highly recommended because you can go at your own pace, see what you want to see and have a much more meaningful experience) if you arrive before 10AM, this is possible if you're staying in Krakow and don't have your own car with some trains from Krakow Glowny arriving between 8am-10am. Another option is to visit the Auschwitz II-Birkenau site first and then return after 3PM to the first camp to avoid having to use the tour. Guided tours cost 40zl (discounted price for students up to 24 years of age is 30zl). The Auschwitz II-Birkenau site is open for visitors without the guide during the opening hours of the Memorial.\n\nThe museum is open until 4pm between November 1 and March 31, the 12:30 tour will get you back for the 4pm bus back to Krakow (goes from behind Auschwitz I, not the main road).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nThe Auschwitz Memorial and Museum is easily navigated on foot.  There is a free bus between Auschwitz and Birkenau. There are toilets at the Auschwitz-I site which cost 1zt to use. At Auschwitz-II there are free toilets at the back of the camp.\n\nTours are provided by the museum for a fee in various languages, and are recommended if you want a deeper understanding of the site, but they are unfortunately somewhat rushed, and you can get a pretty good feel by buying a guidebook and map (small, simple guide = 5zl; more detailed \"souvenir\" guide = 12zl - covering Auschwitz and Birkenau) and wandering around on your own (provided you arrive before 10AM - after 10AM, for crowd control purposes, guided tours are mandatory). Each exhibit is described in Polish with other language translations. The scope of the evil and terror that occurred here is almost unimaginable and a guide can help to put in context what a room full of human hair or what a thousand pairs of infant shoes means.

Do not take anything from the camp area with you \"as a souvenir\", and do not make Nazi salutes, even jokingly — these are considered offences under Polish law, and if you commit them, you will be placed before the court and could be subjected to a prison sentence of up to two years for propagating fascism.
