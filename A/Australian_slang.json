[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Australia banner Kangaroos on beach.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Australian slang"]}," is informal language used in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Australia"]]},". \n\nThis guide should be viewed as an informal and fun introduction to some Australian idiosyncrasies, rather than a guide on how to communicate. \n\nIncreasing globalisation and a move away from rural living has seen Australian English adopt a lot of American terms while at the same time romanticising words commonly associated with the bush.  Australians mostly view their slang as being uniquely Australian and an integral part of their culture. Judging by the amount of Australian slang books available on the shelves, it remains of interest to travellers too.\n\nMany parts of Australian slang have their origins outside Australia, particularly in England and Ireland.  Don't be surprised if many terms seem familiar. However, don't assume that similar slang expressions have the same meaning to Australians as they might in other countries. An attempt to use some Australian slang will likely be viewed as an attempt to mock, rather than as a genuine attempt to speak the local dialect. It's better to use the guide to interpret Steve Irwin's TV shows.  \n\nEnglish speaking travellers are best advised just to speak clearly, as most Australians are used to a variety of accents.  However, it can never hurt to say \"G'day, How are ya goin'\" to an Aussie.
