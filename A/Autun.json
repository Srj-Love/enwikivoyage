The cathédrale Saint-Lazare (Cathedral of St. Lazarus) is the 12th-century historic edifice famous for the superb artwork of the Romanesque master Gislebertus. It is considered as the most significant church in the town and also as among the most vital Romanesque churches in the country. Originally, the structure was intended to be a pilgrimage church instead of a cathedral as it was dedicated to Lazarus, the man who was raised from death by Jesus. His relics, preserved in this Autun Cathedral, were found in the area in the 12th century.
