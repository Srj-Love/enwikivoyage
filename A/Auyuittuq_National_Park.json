A boat ride to and from the park is required from both these communities. This can be arranged with a local outfitter. Peter Kilabuk in Pangnirtung is highly recommended. Boat rides in Pang cost $80-$100 and are about 45min long and tide-dependent. Billy Arnaquq is the only outfitter out of Qikiqtarjuaq. Boat rides out of Qik cost $180 and are 3-5 hours long depending how how rough the ocean is.

The best time to cross is between 4am and 8am when rivers are at their lowest levels. Some rivers including Turner River and Halfhour Creek are particularly dangerous in the late afternoon. Hikers have died in the past trying to cross rivers too late in the day. There is a risk of polar bears on the north side of the park near Qikiqtarjuaq. Always carry deterrents as rifles are not allowed in the park. And NEVER leave food near your campsite. The north side of the Pass (Thor side) is prone to rock falls and is not a recommended route for this reason.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Baffin Island"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinepark"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["67.883333"],["-61.016667"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Auyuittuq National Park"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Auyuittuq National Park"]]}]
