Food is reasonably priced, especially outside of the main towns at lunchtimes where you can often find a fixed menu with wine for around €12-€14. The Aveyron also has a number of excellent Michelin starred restaurants including Michel Bras (Aubrac), Le Vieux Pont (Belcastel) and Le Senechal (Sauveterre de Rouergue) for lovers of haute cuisine. There is usually no problem getting a table at a local restaurant, except on Sunday lunchtimes and bank holidays when it is a good idea to book.  Outside of the main summer season, many restaurants in the countryside close on Sunday and\/or Monday evenings.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Midi-Pyrenees"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Aveyron"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["44.25"],["2.7"]]}]
