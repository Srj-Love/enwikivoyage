It is the main city of the département of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vaucluse"]]},", and is on the banks of the Rhône river. Avignon was one of the European Cities of Culture in 2000.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nAvignon is famous as the city to which the Popes fled when leaving the corruption of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rome"]]}," in the 14th century. The palace they built, ",{"type":"'''","value":["Le Palais des Papes"]},", or the Palace of Popes, is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["world's largest ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gothic architecture"],["Gothic"]]}," edifice"]},". It was largely emptied over the centuries, and its vast stone rooms are filled with little more than old frescos, but it is still an imposing building. The Ramparts themselves were erected to keep the plague and invaders out during the turbulent Middle Ages, when Avignon belonged to the papacy and not the French crown.\n\nIts early history is much older than the popes, however. Avignon occupies a strategic location for several reasons - it is at the confluence of two once-mighty rivers: the Rhône, still one of the biggest rivers in France, and the now largely-dammed Durance. Both were important routes of trade and communication even in prehistoric times. In addition, there is a long island in the Rhone that made it possible to ferry people and goods across, and later bridge the river, more easily than in other places.\n\nIt is estimated that about 200,000 people live in Avignon, 16,000 of which live 'intra-muros,' or within the ramparts built in the 14th century.\n\nThe city is now sprinkled with buildings and monuments ranging from the new to the old, the very old, and the ageless.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" History "]},"\nAvignon has been continuously inhabited since the stone age, when inhabitations were built in caves in the “Rocher des Doms”, a massive outcropping of rock rising over the banks of the Rhône. Today, a public park with benches, views over the surrounding countryside, a café and playground is on top of the Rocher.\n\nThe Romans had a presence in Avignon, though the walls they built lie buried somewhere under the modern streets. Vestiges of the forum can still be seen, lying unassumingly near the Rue Racine and the Rue Saint-Étienne, to the west of the city.\n\nThen, in medieval times, the town grew to an important center of communication and trade. The stone bridge spanning the Rhone was one of only three between the Mediterranean and Lyon. It was undoubtedly for its strategic location and ease of travel that it was chosen by the papacy as home within the then kingdom of Provence. The presence of the papacy made Avignon into a city of great political and economic activity. The old city wall, now visible only as a street that circles the very center of the town (changing names 5 times in the process!) was much too small and a larger wall, still visible today, was necessary to protect its bulging population. Wealthy Cardinals built extravagant palaces known as livrées both within Avignon and across the river, in Villeneuve-lès-Avignon.\n\nThe city teemed with activity and building as architects, builders, artists flocked to the town. At that time, within the city walls there were over 100 churches and chapels - many of which have been transformed since then into everything from shops to a movie theater! The wealth and activity generated by the presence of the papacy spilled out into the region, so that even small villages nearby boast a rich architectural past.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Aéroport d'Avignon-Caumont ",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["AVN"]]}],["alt=Avignon Airport"],["url= http:\/\/www.avignon.aeroport.fr aéroport"],["email="],["address="],["lat= 43.90450648817977"],["long= 4.897555070347153"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content= ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cityjet.com Cityjet"]}]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.flybe.com Flybe"]}]}," operate flights from the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United Kingdom"]]}," to Avignon Airport ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.avignon.aeroport.fr\/en\/"]},"."]]}]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Avignon TGV Station"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address= Avenue de la Gare, 84000 Avignon"],["lat= 43.92184920653942"],["long=  4.78659837244777"],["directions="],["image= Avignon TGV 1.jpg"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content= Avignon lies on the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.tgv.com\/ TGV"]}," line from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Paris"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Marseille"]]},", about two hours and half from Paris, Gare de Lyon.

The bridge was built in the Middle Ages - before the arrival of the Papacy - perhaps partly to allow the local bishop to cross the river to Villeneuve-lès-Avignon, where the church authorities had installed themselves because of Avignon's then-infamous dirt and lawlessness. The legend of the bridge's building is that a local shepherd, Benezet (a dialect form of Benedict) was inspired by angels to build a bridge. When his appeals to the town authorities proved fruitless, he picked up a vast block of stone and hurled it into the river, to be the bridge's foundation stone. Convinced by this demonstration of divine will, the bridge was swiftly built. The poor shepherd boy was canonised, and his chapel remains on the surviving portion of the bridge.\nIf the bridge was divinely inspired, the Deity must have quickly changed his mind, because before long the bridge became unsafe and, following numerous floods, mostly derelict. Originally, the bridge had 22 arches, reaching across to the tower of Philippe le Bel via the mid-stream île de la Barthelasse. Only 4 of the 22 arches now remain. A multilingual audio tour of the bridge explains some of the local history.\nThe well-known song \"Sur ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.travel-avignon.info\/pont_d_avignon.html Le Pont D'Avignon"]}]},"\" (on the bridge at Avignon) refers to the bridge. The bridge itself is far too narrow for dancing or festivals - the original text of the song was \"Sous (under) le pont d'Avignon\", referring to the festivals and entertainments staged on the île de la Barthelasse. The current version was popularised by a 19th-century operetta, whose librettist clearly assumed that 'sous le pont d'Avignon' would have meant in the river."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Museums"]},"\nAvignon has its share of museums, ranging from ",{"type":"'''","value":["Modern Art Museums"]}," to museums housing artifacts from the Roman and pre-Roman days.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nIf you are confident about biking, there are a lot of places to bike to.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Events "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Theatre Festival"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.festival-avignon.com"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Avignon is famous the world over for its annual theatre festival.
