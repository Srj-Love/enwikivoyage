In particular, it has become popular as the summer holiday destination for followers of London's UK Garage music scene. British tourists are still the most prevalent here, but recent years have also seen a significant increase in the number of Russians holidaying in the area. It is also a long-time favourite among Scandinavians.\n\nBeyond the clubbing, however, Ayia Napa attracts tourists world-wide on account of its fun-loving (some would say, totally hedonistic) outlook by night and its sandy Mediterranean beaches by day.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nMost travellers arrive at Ayia Napa by flights to the island of Cyprus that land at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Larnaca"]]}," airport.

There is a selection of idyllic powder white sand beaches. The water is crystal clear with a lovely blue-green colour. The water tends to be quite shallow. Even if you are a swimming pool person, visiting Agia Napa’s beaches will surely convert you. Every beach will have a water sports centre so make sure you know the boundaries of the swimming and powerboat areas. Accidents have happened.

The Square should be your first choice for nightlife in the area. Although the area is a lot smaller than you might expect, there is a lot packed into the area and there are plenty of places to drink. Main bars include Bedrock, the Castle Club and Ice. Be aware that competition between various bars is phenomenally fierce and most bars employ promotional staff who will accost you on the street with offers of free shots or drinks. These people are exceptionally persistant and will even go as far as to grab you should you refuse to acknowledge them. Although they pose no threat they can be very annoying. Be particularly aware of those trying to promote Toga Toga or Moulin Rouge, the main strip clubs on the island. By all means, listen to the various PR people if you're partially interested because they can get you genuine deals in bars and clubs, but remember that ultimately these people's sole aim is to make you poorer and them richer, so politely tolerate but don't fall for their efforts to try and make friends with you. However, it can be amusing to distract them from their job and try to engage them in long conversation. Watch out for two guys that come around asking if you want to come on a boat party as it is a load of rubbish.\n\nClubs and bars are open until daybreak and as a result, the 'scene' doesn't really begin to pick up until around 11-ish. Patrons who are used to attending bars from 8PM and heading to a club around midnight will need to reset their body clocks. The square is practically deserted until 9.30PM: most clubbers don't even bother going out until after 11, and most clubs won't open until after 1AM. Those expecting a cheap night out are also going to be slightly disappointed. Drinks prices are generally the same in most bars - a bottle of Keo will set you back around CYP£1.50-2, which isn't dissimilar from UK prices. Watch out in clubs - in Castle Club bottles of Carlsberg (the only bottled beer in the club) will set you back a whopping CYP£3. Admission fees can also be high - Ice can charge anything up to CYP£8 to get in, but canny clubbers should be able to find a good deal. Promo people can be quite helpful in this regard, and if you know where you're planning to go, you can usually pick up cheaper advance tickets. Some bars also have arrangements with clubs - one of the bars behind Castle (Red Square) offers buy-one-get-one-free on some of their drinks and will give you free entrance ticket to Castle or Starskys. \n\nFor an area that's fuelled by alcohol, Ayia Napa seems to suffer very little from anti-social behaviour. Provided you observe general bar and club ettiquete you are extremely unlikely to encounter any trouble from other clubbers, locals or the police. The atmosphere in general is a very good, positive one, which offsets the fact that your night out is going to be more expensive than one in the UK.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nIf you are looking to get away from it all and relax with your family in privacy, then a holiday villa may be the right choice for you. By renting a private villa, you will have your own kitchen, living\/dining room, bedroom and in many cases your own private swimming pool. Renting a villa provides you, not only, with more space and privacy but may also be a more economical option rather than staying at a small hotel room. A villa can usually accommodate a minimum of 4 people, and the rental price is charged per week making it more cost-effective than staying at a hotel.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Alexia Hotel Apartments"],["url=http:\/\/www.alexiahotel.com"],["email="],["address=1st October 14"],["lat=34.98381205504191"],["long=34.00236904621124"],["directions=Near Grecian Beach, Ayia Napa Harbor"],["phone=+357 23722211"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=40"],["checkin=13:00"],["checkout=12:00"],["content=Family owned and run hotel apartments, situated near Grecian Beach."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Aphelandra Hotel"],["url=http:\/\/www.aphelandrahotel.com"],["email="],["address=Cavo Greco Str, 5344 Ayia Napa"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+357 23 72 19 06"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=50 tastefully-furnished apartment complex in Ayia Napa.
