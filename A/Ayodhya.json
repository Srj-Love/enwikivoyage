It has a central role in the ancient Indian epic, the Ramayana, whose protagonist Lord Rama is God incarnated on Earth as the prince of Ayodhya. The epic describes Lord Rama's 14 year exile, his victory over evil and his grand return with his wife Sita to Ayodhya to become king. This return to Ayodhya is celebrated as Diwali, the leading festival of hundreds of millions of Hindus world-wide. Consequently Lord Rama's reign over Ayodhya and its surroundings, called Ram Rajya, is the epitome of good governance and moral society in the Hindu tradition.\n\nThe story of Rama has transcended into a great inspirational story and parable for children and adults around the world. Ayodhya has come to symbolise inner peace, joy and spiritual upliftment.\n\nHowever, there are less savory aspects to Ayodhya's history. In 1527, the Mughal Emperor Babur had a mosque constructed at the site in Ayodhya traditionally associated with the birth of Rama. The resulting Babri Mosque, which became a focal point of grievances against actions taken by Muslims to deprecate Hinduism, was ultimately destroyed by demonstrators in 1992. Following the destruction, thousands of people were killed in acts of terrorism and intercommunal violence, especially in Gujarat.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["Regional Tourist Office, House No. 1-3\/152\/4, near Pusparaj Guest House, Civil Lines, Faizabad, UP.
