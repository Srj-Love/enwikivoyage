Throughout the centuries, an ideal location between China, India, and the Malay Archipelago made Ayutthaya the trading capital of Asia and even the world. By 1700 Ayutthaya had become the largest city in the world with a total of 1 million inhabitants. Many international merchants set sail for Ayutthaya, from diverse regions as the Arab world, China, India, Japan, Portugal, the Netherlands, and France. Merchants from Europe proclaimed Ayutthaya as the finest city they had ever seen. Dutch and French maps of the city show grandeur with gold-laden palaces, large ceremonies, and a visiting flotilla of trading vessels from all over the world. All this came to a quick end when the Burmese invaded Ayutthaya in 1767 and almost completely burnt the city to the ground.\n\nToday, only a few remains give a glimpse of the impressive city they must have seen. Its remains are characterized by the prang (reliquary towers) and big monasteries. Most of the remains are temples and palaces, as those were the only buildings made of stone at that time.

This trip is scheduled to be around an hour and a half, but allow at least two hours for the trip since the buses stop rather frequently and there are often jams on the roads out of\/into Bangkok.\n\nTo get to the Northern Bus Terminal, take Skytrain to Mo Chit BTS Station. Upon exiting gantry gates, cross the bridge on the right to go to bus-stop, and take bus service 3 or bus service 77. (air-con buses charge 12 baht, non air-con buses charge 7 baht). The bus ride is about 10–15 minutes and the Northern Bus Terminal destination is the last stop for the buses.

The buses are parked on a side soi (Ratchawithi 11) parallel to the market stalls at the bottom of the stairs. Head to the front end of the buses to find the ones that are about to leave. The cost is 60 baht, and take around 1 hour to 1 hour 20 min.

You'll need to book in advance as there are no scheduled services, just trips for tourists.  It's a fairly lengthy trip (at least one whole day) and some of the larger boats offer (pricey) overnight tours.\n\nTravelling by boat to Ayutthaya is popular among foreigners as it reveals the beauty as well as lifestyle of the people on both sides of the Chao Phraya River, and also recalls life at the time of the Ayutthaya Kingdom when the Chao Phraya River served as the highway for trade with foreign countries.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bicycle"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cycling"]]}," around the ruins is the most enjoyable and fun way to spend the day. The archaeological park is easily reachable and manageable on bike even if you aren't very fit. The paths are paved and the distances between temples are small. You can rent a bicycle for around 40 baht per day. The bicycles are not necessarily well maintained, so be sure that they work properly (wheels are firm and inflated, seats adjusted to your height and well attached, handlebars don't slip); good shops will give you a bike lock as well. There is a good bike shop directly opposite the train station.\n\nA free map of the city is widely available in all hotels.\n\nThe park opens at 07:30.

Ayutthaya's tuk-tuks are larger than the Bangkok variety and you can easily squeeze six people in on facing benches. Only \"official\" tuk-tuk drivers or tourist \"helpers\" can pick up passengers from the train station. You can verify their status by looking for their photos\/name on a \"Tourist Officials\" board displayed at the south end of the platform. These people are required to charge\/work for fixed rates, usually quoting 300 baht\/hour, but this can usually be bargained down to a slightly lower price (e.g., 1,000 baht for 4 hrs).\n\nYou can also flag down tuk-tuks from the street and try to hire them. Most drivers carry with them a stack of postcards featuring the famous sites of the city to ease communications. They also are used to the standard temple-hopping circuit. If you have a map you can point out any of the destinations that you wish to see and they'll often quote a trip price and will wait for you at each stop. 200 baht per hour seems to be the starting point for tourist tuk-tuks picking up backpackers away from the station, although it may be possible to negotiate a lower price.\n\nIf entering the city by mini-bus, there is a possibility your driver will drop you off at a tuk-tuk who offers to take you around the wats for 2,000+ baht. The driver may have a book filled with positive testimonials in a range of different languages from tourists who were his past passengers. Don't let these positive comments convince you otherwise, simply say \"no, thanks\" and move on to find another tuk-tuk driver with whom you can negotiate a fair rate.\n\nFrom Ayutthaya, mini-buses can be taken from the railway station into the city. Hiring a mini- bus within Ayutthaya costs between 400-500 baht\/day. For travelling between Ayutthaya and Bang Pa-in, mini-buses regularly leave Chao Prom Market, Chao Prom Rd starting from 06:00.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\n\nBoat trips to enjoy the beautiful scenery and Thai lifestyle along the Chao Phraya River, the Pa Sak River and around the town island of Ayutthaya are available.
