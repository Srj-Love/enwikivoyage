[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Caribbean default banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Añasco"]}," is a city in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Porta del Sol"]]}," region of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Puerto Rico"]]},". Old town Añasco offers typical Puerto Rican hangout places with its large central square or plaza and well preserved churches. \n\nAñasco holds an important place in Puertorrican history, as it was here that the Spanish Conquistadores were proven to be mortals.  A group of rebel Taino natives attacked and drowned a Spanish conquistador named SALCEDO, thus debunking the myth that the Spanish were gods. A bronze fountain in the main square depicts this act of bravery and defiance of colonial Spanish rule. \n\nToday, Añasco is known for its Hojaldre cake (filled with brandy and spices) and the Chipe clam. \n\nAñasco Beach has a Balneario or public beach facility, located on beautiful Tres Hermanos Beach. It completes the chain of surfing beaches in Northwestern Puerto Rico.\n\nAñasco is located on a perfect spot in the west side of the lsland, closed by many tourist attractions and marvelous places to see. It serves as a strategic location for visitors to enjoy the many beauties that Puerto Rico offers.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nFrom Aguadilla take I-PR-2 South.
