After the devastating 1904-fire, the entire city was quickly rebuilt in a the distinct Art Nouveau or Jugendstil of the time.

The compact old city centre is thus surrounded by water and Ålesund is one of Norway's major fisheries harbour. To the east are the Sunnmøre Alps which offers a dramatic backdrop. The old city centre of Ålesund was totally destroyed by fire in 1904, only a single small house remained. Much international aid, including personal gifts from Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany who used to holiday there, helped to rebuild in what was then high-fashion, Art Nouveau or ",{"type":"''","value":["Jugendstil"]}," as it is known in Ålesund. The consistent architectural style gives Ålesund a distinct central European vibe and Ålesund's cityscape is instantly recognizable. Few hours after the disaster become known to the world, Germany sent ships with food, medicine and blankets towards Ålesund. Because of the aid to the homeless people of Ålesund, this is one of the few places where Kaiser Wilhelm remains a hero, one the key streets downtown is Keiser Wilhelm gate. At the time of the fire, Ålesund was a young city that from around 1850 expanded rapidly from the small trading post at present centre. Ålesund was from the beginning based on fish trade. During the middle ages there was however a small town or trading post further east at Borgund Church, now the site of Sunnmøre Museum. The Borgund trading post vanished around year 1500.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Borgund folkehøgskole ved Storfjorden og inngangen til Hjørundfjorden.jpg"],["thumb"],["200px"],["Hjørundfjord and Storfjord seen from Ålesund suburbs"]]},"\nWhile Ålesund faces the ocean, the great Sunnmøre alps and the iconic fjords make up Ålesund's scenic hinterland.

For independent travelers Ålesund is not the best base to explore the wild interior as time and money must spent on transport.

The view of Brosundet is quite stunning. By Hellebroa there is an outdoor restaurant area which is very popular among tourists and locals alike. From there you can walk down onto the tourist boat area and further along to Skateflua with further restaurants and outdoors serving areas. \n\nAlso, from Skateflua, you can catch various tourist and express boats to popular destinations, buy fish directly from fishermen's boats and go rafting if the weather is nice.\n\nYou should also visit the Geirangerfjord, which is a world heritage site and arguably the most fabulous fjord experience there is.

If you're a visitor out for some youthful partying, it might therefore be advisable to go somewhere else for a few pints first and then go out looking for where the action is after midnight. \n\nAll establishments close at 3 am by Norwegian law. This usually leads to complete chaos (as most people stay until then) and people standing around for hours in taxi queues. If you need transportation, it is therefore advisable to call the taxi company no later than 2 am. If you live in the city centre, it might be advisable to plan on leaving a little earlier as well, just to avoid drunk people in the streets.\n\nIf you want to buy alcohol from a shop, beer can be gotten in normal supermarkets until 8pm (6pm Saturdays) for 25 NOK for a 1\/2 litre can. Anything stronger than 4.7% can only be got from state authorised Vinmonopolet (until 6pm weekdays, 3pm Saturdays), located in Kremmergaarden in the centre, as well as the Moa shopping centre in the suburbs. Note that supermarkets are not allowed to sell any alcohol after these hours, even if they are still open.
