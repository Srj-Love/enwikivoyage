For some reason it has attracted some unfavourable comments on travel boards but it's a superbly located transport hub and the Romsdal valley itself is one of the most monumental and romantic valleys of Norway.

Åndalsnes sits at the mouth of Rauma river, opposite the village of Veblungsnes (the former centre), which has a characteristic parish church. Romsdal is the valley of the great Rauma river. Åndalsnes is also the terminal station for the Raumabanen (railway line) running through the valley. Near Åndalsnes the main Romsdal valley converges with the shorter but even more dramatic Isterdal valley, home to famous ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Trollstigen"]]}," hairpin road and mountain pass as well as more wild summits. The lower parts of the two valleys are dominated by the confluence of rivers Rauma and Istra, the delta they create and the meanders through which they flow. The valley floor is surprisingly flat and even between these wild mountains.\n\nThe Romsdal valley allows easy connection to the inland counties of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oppland"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hedmark"]]},", and is in fact a western continuation of the great eastern valley ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gudbrandsdalen"]]},". Lesjaskogsvatnet lake is exactly at the watershed and water from the lake flows both east and west. Åndalsnes' central location made it a transport hub and old trading post. Most visitors by car, train or bus will eventually drive through the valley. The valley has given its name to the district surrounding the Moldefjord\/Romsdalsfjord, as well as the entire county.\n\nThe Romsdal valley begins around the county line in the highlands where the valley and the river quickly descends through gorges (with lovely rapids and waterfalls) to the relatively even and low valley floor. The road and the railway then runs between some of the highest cliffs and highest waterfalls in Europe. Nearby Eikesdalen valley (as well as Sunndalen) are also home to some of the highest waterfalls in Europe. All waterfalls in Romsdal valley are easily accessible and visible from the car window and from the train (Mongefossen is perhaps the tallest waterfall visible from a train).\n\nÅndalsnes and Romsdal valley was one early key tourist destinations in Western Norway. In particular affluent English gentlemen were attracted by the salmon angling in great landscape. Property were purchased and hotels established by the English. The alpine pioneer William Cecil Slingsby visited Romsdal, in addition to Sunnmøre alps (around ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hjørundfjord"]]},") and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jotunheimen"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Romsdal alps"]},"\nRomsdal with Isterdalen and nearby Isfjorden and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Eikesdalen"]]}," valleys are home to the Romsdal alps, a group of breathtaking alpine summits. These are the most accessible of Norway's alpine peaks, easily viewed from the main road and railway the runs close. The iconic Romsdalshorn stands opposite the 1000 meter vertical rock face Trollveggen, famous among climbers and BASE jumpers (now forbidden). Trollveggen is in turn surrounded by sharp peaks and more forbidding rock faces. The Isterdalen valley and Trollstigen (on Trollveggens rear) is home to peaks aptly named Bishop, King and Queen, as well as the Troll's claws. Eikesdalen valley is also a hidden gem of imposing mountains around the lovely lake.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Raumabanen"]},"\nRaumabanen or the Rauma Railway runs between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dombås"]]}," and Åndalsnes, the name \"Rauma\" refers to the river along which the line runs. The rail line runs parallel to road E136 and mostly offers the same views. The railway was an engineering achievement in the 1910-20s, particularly the switchback (including Kylling bridge) system at Verma - the switchback was constructed to the climb the steep valley and cross the gorges at Verma where the high valley (Bjorli\/Lesja at upper part of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gudbrandsdalen"]]},") plunges into the low valley (Romsdal valley proper). There are several great masonry arc bridges on the line: One crossing a river gorge at Dombås, one crossing the gorge and waterfall at Verma, and a somewhat smaller crossing the river near the county line. All bridges accessible from the main road. Raumabanen is 110 km and construction lasted about 14 years. The complicated construction of Kylling bridge lasted about 9 years.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nÅndalsnes played a key role in the dramatic days following the German invasion April 9, 1940. British troops landed at Åndalsnes to support the Norwegian Army and the town was totally destroyed by the subsequent German bombing. The British troops landed at Åndalsnes (as well as Namsos) were engaged in the first Allied direct combat with German troops during the war. The King, cabinet and Bank of Norway's gold and cash holdings were evacuated through Åndalsnes amidst heavy fighting in a bold and legendary operation. The Raumabanen railway was then strategically important as it connected Oslo and East Norway to the protected harbour at Åndalsnes. Later during the war the railway was the target of sabotage intended to interrupt German transport of troops and supplies. \n\nMore than 300 years earlier Åndalsnes and Romsdal valley saw the landing of Scottish mercenary troops en route to join the war in Sweden.
