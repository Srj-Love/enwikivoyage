It was formed at the end of the 12th century thanks to a dispute between the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Count of Breda"]}," and the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Duke of Brabant"]}," that led to a puzzle that continues to the present time. On Dutch soil, in Baarle and surroundings, are 22 enclaves belonging to Belgium and these Belgian enclaves in turn include 7 Dutch enclaves. Often these boundaries run across houses. The nationality of the inhabitants is determined by the position of the front door. A story tells that a Belgian displaced his front door to avoid getting the Dutch nationality.\n\nIn Baarle everything is twice: two churches, two town halls, two post offices, two fire stations, two police forces (which are now housed in the same building) and so on. Even if outsiders say that this state would be untenable, the Baarler want to remain this extreme situation in any case, otherwise, they explain, in Baarle nothing more was going on. This place is a good example of two cultures that tolerate each other for almost two hundred years.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Tourist information"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=VVV Baarle Tourist Office"],["url="],["email= info@vvvbaarle-nassau.nl"],["address= Nieuwstraat 16, 5111 CW Baarle-Nassau, Netherlands"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+31 13 507 99 21"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Tue - Fri 11 AM – 3 PM, Sat 10 AM – 3 PM"],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nThe village Baarle is well accessible by car via the two Dutch provincial roads N260 and N639 and the Belgian provincial road N119.
