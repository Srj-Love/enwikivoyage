That's a shame because staying overnight in the backcountry is a real gem of an experience that shouldn't be missed. Hundreds of routes abound to suit all tastes from novice to hardcore.\n\nParks Canada has continued to maintain an excellent network of trails and campsites. Some of these campsites can get busy (any campsite near a town definitely will be). But the bulk of backcountry campsites are empty to half empty for most of the hiking season. If you're planning on staying somewhere popular (anywhere near the town of Banff) or camping in July you should reserve a site with Parks Canada.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\n\nSeasonal camping passes are available from Parks Canada.
