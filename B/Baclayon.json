It was the first town established in Bohol by the Spaniards.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]}," \nThe town was founded in 1595 by two Jesuit priests, Father Juan de Torres and Father Gabriel Sanchez, the first to enter Bohol for missionary work. In 1596 the priests built the  Baclayon Church of the Immaculate Conception,  a heavy-set stone church considered one of the oldest churches in the Philippines. \n\nThe church, in combination with the pier and harbor it overlooks, and the elegant and well-preserved heritage houses lining the roads, makes the township a charming and idyllic destination.\n\nThe town of Baclayon got its name from their tribal chieftain Baclayon. He was a warrior of a conquering tribe from the \"Malays.\" He guarded the invasion of pirates and pillagers from Cebu, Iloilo and Mindanao. When the two Jesuit priests came, he submitted his tribe and warriors and embraced Christianity. He was given a Christian name \"Zacarias\" by the Spanish priest Sanchez. Considering the popularity of Zacarias' leadership in the territory, the priest used the name Baclayon as the name of the territory.\n\nThe original territorial jurisdiction of Baclayon was so vast that it covered the present areas of the municipalities of Balilihan, Alburquerque, Catigbian, Corella, Sikatuna and San Isidro combined together.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nThe closest airport to Baclayon is in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tagbilaran"]]},", the capital of Bohol.

Ferries also present more route options than flying and can often be faster than an indirect flight. Many ferries travel the most popular route of Cebu - Tagbilaran, with high-speed ferries taking 1.5hrs, or 5hrs on the regular, slower vessels.

Officially Pamilacan means “resting place of the mantas’, but is also been interpreted to derive from the word ‘pamilac’ or harpoon, a weapon that was historically used to capture the mantas, dolphins and whales. Pamilacan Island is now seen as a success story in the transformation of the community from their destructive, unsustainable hunting practices, to the protection of their marine life with dolphin and whalewatching tours now providing a valuable alternative livelihood. Pamilacan Island has also been the recipient of numerous awards from tourism councils and environmental organizations in recognition of their remarkable makeover. The island has beautiful white sand beaches, and is endowed with some great dive sites, such as ‘Dakit-Dakit’. Additionally, the island is also home to a 200-year-old Spanish fort, located at the northeast of the island, which in the past served as a watch station for the Spaniards against intruders, such as pirates and other enemies. Pump-boat rides from Baclayon to Pamilacan Island can cost upward from Php1500 per boat and it is normally advisable to organize this a day in advance if possible through the Municipal Tourism Information Center (see Contacts). However, Wednesdays are Market Days in Baclayon, and as such, more pump-boats operate to cater for the islanders visiting the market.
