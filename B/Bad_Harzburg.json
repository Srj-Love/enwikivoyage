It is named after a former imperial castle, the Harzburg, which used to stand proud on the heights above the town, but is now a ruin with just a few walls and ramparts remaining. The town itself caters largely for residents taking the \"cure\" as well as tourists - especially ramblers and cyclists - visiting the Harz. As a result, the centre is a pedestrian zone with small shops and timber-framed houses, surrounded by sprawling suburbs - a mix of impressive timber-framed residences and functional modern buildings.\n\nBad Harzburg is a great base for exploring the northern Harz. There is an 80-year old cable car to the Harzburg above the town called the ",{"type":"''","value":["Harzbergbahn"]},". Once on the top, there is a network of easy walking trails and numerous sights within striking distance including the Lynx Enclosure near the Rabenklippe crags and several outstanding viewing points over the surrounding area.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By car "]},"\nThe best place to park is the huge free car park on the B 4 just south of the town.
