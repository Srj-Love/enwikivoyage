It has a lively shopping centre, and a beautiful old town with traditional swiss buildings, and small castle, all on the banks of the river Limmat which flows from Lake Zurich. Half of the town is dominated by the industrial\/office complexes of Alstom and ABB, and the local economy is dependent upon their power plant manufacturing, but historically people were attracted to Baden for its thermal baths.\n\nA nice, small town to stay in while visiting the larger and busier cities in the region, such as Zurich.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By train "]},"\nBaden is served by rail. Located just outside Zürich, it is served by the S6 (37 min) and S12 (30 min) lines of the Zürich S-Bahn commuter rail network. If you have an all-zone Zürich transport card and are coming from Zürich, you should buy a single ticket from Otelfingen (for S6) or Dietikon (for S12). Connections westwards are available by Aargau local trains S23 and S27 to Olten and Waldshut as well as interregional trains to Basel and Berne.
