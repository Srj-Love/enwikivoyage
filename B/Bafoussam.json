Be warned that most agences hire \"loaders\" to find passengers and to load their baggage, and that these loaders can be very aggressive!

There are also some vendors with \"carts\" selling fresh fruit like slices of pineapple or papaya. Keep an eye out for spaghetti omelette carts (visible because of their stack of egg crates). They're cheap (500 CFA for three eggs and spaghetti in bread) and nutritious.\n\nIf none of those options appeal to you, you can also check out the supermarkets\/bakeries, which sometimes have \"sandwiches\" or other pre-made food. In particular the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Boulangerie du Peuple"]}," has a pretty good (no-cheese, no-meat) \"pizza\" for 400 CFA per \"slice\".
