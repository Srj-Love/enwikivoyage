It was also used as a holding point for slaves brought from the interior and awaiting transportation to Zanzibar.  During German colonial times, it was the economic and administrative capital of German East Africa.  Since the capital was moved to Dar Es Salaam, Bagomoyo has been in decline.  Architecture of European origin is rarely maintained and thus slowly falling apart, while still often beautiful to see.  The Arabic influence on local architecture is also significant.\n\nThere is a lot of poverty and unemployment in Bagamoyo, so be aware from muggings and robberies. While the town is usually safe during the day, avoid walking outside late at night. It is also advisable to avoid the slum expands towards the east. Be very aware of people monitoring you while standing somewhere or sitting in a restaurant. Don't expect any help of the police, they don't care about you and even discourage you from opening a case. However, if you loudly scream for help, locals will quickly gather and help you.
