The shape and construction of each building is highly significant in Buddhism with each component taking on spiritual meaning.\n\nWhen comparing this immense archaeological site to other archaeological gems of Southeast Asia, the Angkor sites, an analogy with food is apt: savouring the Angkor sites is like a Chinese Lauriat banquet where the temples are presented in grand and exquisite servings and takes a long time (about 10 to 15 minutes) to get from one to the next. Bagan is served up Spanish tapas-style, in small bite size servings, often in frequent intervals and near to each other.\n\nWhat makes the temples look romantic is the process of graceful ageing. There are no windbreaks and occasional whirlwinds spawn loose dust particles that sandblast the temples. This has eroded the stucco coatings of the temples to reveal the underlying bricks, reddish, and golden brown when bathed in sunlight.\n\nErosion is a significant threat to this area, not only the wind chipping away the buildings' parging, but also water from the Ayeyarwady (Irrawaddy) River threatens the riverbanks. Strong river currents have already washed away half of the area of Old Bagan. It used to be a rectangular-shaped piece of enclave protected by a perimeter wall. Now the remaining triangular eastern half is exposed to the river.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nBagan became powerful in the mid-9th century under King Anawratha, who unified Burma under Theravada Buddhism. It is estimated that as many as 13,000 temples and stupas once stood on this 42km",{"type":"<","value":["sup",["2"]]}," plain in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["central Myanmar"]]},", and Marco Polo once described Bagan as a \"",{"type":"''","value":["gilded city alive with tinkling bells and the swishing sounds of monks' robes"]},"\". Approximately 2,200 remnants remain today, in various states of disrepair. Some are large and well maintained, such as the Ananda Pahto, others are small tumbledown relics in the middle of overgrown grass. All sites are considered sacred, so when visiting, be respectful. Remove footwear and socks before entering or stepping onto them.\n\nBagan's golden age ended in 1287 when the kingdom and its capital city was invaded and sacked by the Mongols. Its population was reduced to a village that remained among the ruins of the once larger city. In 1998, this village and its inhabitants were forcibly relocated a few kilometres to the south of Bagan, forming \"New Bagan\" where you will find accommodation in its handful of cheap, quaint, clean hotels, and religious centres.\n\nDespite the majesty and importance of Bagan, UNESCO did not include it on its ",{"type":"[[","value":[["World Heritage List"],["World Heritage Site"]]},", because it says some temples were rebuilt in an ",{"type":"''","value":["un-historic"]}," fashion.

With a little practice, you can deconstruct the structures into their basic elements.\n\nThe simplest structure starts with a stupa shaped like a chess pawn. It caches a tiny sacred piece of human remains, relics of the Buddha, or a simple commemorative votive piece. Some stupas have a single pierced niche housing a Buddha icon, which can be viewed by the devotee from the outside. As complexity kicked in, the niches became bigger and no longer fit in the stupa, so a cube block base was introduced to accommodate the enlarged niche which eventually became a cell. With the cube block casing the cell now fully defined, the stupa became its topping. Then, the cube's cell's entrance developed a vestibule, while the cell increased to two (back to back), eventually completing all the sides, one for each cardinal compass point (north-south-east-west), and eventually as it became bigger, a dark claustrophobic ambulatory connected all four cells. Becoming more articulate and intricate, the cube's top taper into two to three tiers and are decorated with smaller corner spires on each while the vestibule protruded further and further out, the doorways decorated with pediments, some with upturned, others with downturned, teeth-like decoration. In others, the tiers became prominent to resemble a stepped pyramid. Meanwhile the stupa became more elaborate as moldings multiplied and sets of tiers and niches were introduced. From a simple gourd-shaped stupa, it evolved into a complex structure. Nobody can be expected to visit more than 20 of these structures, let alone all 2,000.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Important temples"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Ananda Temple"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Left side on the southern stretch of the Bagan-Nyaung Oo Rd just before the road heads to Tharaba Gate of Old Bagan"],["phone="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Bagan's holiest temple, built by the third king, Kyan-Zit-Tha in 1091.
