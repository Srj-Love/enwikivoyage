Movement within Baghdad is difficult and entry into the International Zone, aka Green Zone, requires a pass or that you be accompanied by authorized officials. Iraq is a war zone and even if you're from a country which is part of the coalition, you will not be granted entry into the IZ without authorization. Most expats and business travellers to Iraq hire a security detail which constantly monitors the security situation within Iraq and around Baghdad. Travel outside the IZ is extremely dangerous. Roadside and car bombs are detonated every day in Baghdad. Many Iraqis are armed. Markets and popular gathering places are frequent targets of bombers. As a foreigner you are more likely to be targeted for kidnapping. Kidnappings are often financially motivated. These threats are not restricted to Americans or women. You are also likely to be refused access to accommodation as Iraqis will fear being targeted for supporting the occupying forces.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Embassies"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["Greece"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Greece"],["url="],["email=gremb.bag@mfa.gr"],["address=Hay Babil, AL-Jadriyah Sector 913, Rd. 31\/ Built 63"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+9641 778 2273, Emergencies:+964 790 364 2046"],["tollfree="],["fax=+870-763262272"],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["Serbia"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Serbia"],["url="],["email="],["address=Jadriya Babil District Mahala 923, ZUKAK 35, Bldg 16"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+9641 \/ 778-78-87"],["tollfree="],["fax=+9641 \/ 778-04-89"],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["United States"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=United States"],["url=http:\/\/iraq.usembassy.gov\/"],["email=irc-baghdad@state.gov; BaghdadACS@state.gov"],["address=Al-Kindi St, International Zone"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Su-Th, 08:00-16:30"],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["33.30313"],["44.37850"],["zoom=14"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Baghdad Belts"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Baghdad"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Middle East\/Iraq\/Localities\/Baghdad\/"]]}]
