From 1575 up to the 16th Century no records were written about the community, records show that on 17th Century, people from the island of Panay migrated to Negros and settled on the riverbanks of Bago River, after these settlers arrived, the settlement then rapidly grew and the settlers then had their own governance, years later their descendants then petitioned to the Spanish authorities to name their ",{"type":"''","value":["\"Pueblo\""]}," or town, ",{"type":"''","value":["\"Bago\""]},".

The said petition was finally granted by the status of a “pueblo” or town in that same year. From 1800 to 1898 the town experienced tyranny and oppression from the Spanish the people then revolted against them, General Juan Araneta led the rally for the struggle of freedom on November 5, 1898. This historic event was chronicled in the Public plaza of Bago City. Together with General Aniceto Lacson who led the forces in Talisay, he was able to force the capitulation of the Spanish garrison at Bacolod thus putting an end to the Spanish sovereignty in the province.  Forthwith, a revolutionary government was established with general Juan A. Araneta as the Acting Governor.

Japanese forces then occupied Bago and attempted to establish a provincial government but refused to co-operate, the Americans liberated the town on March 29, 1945 with the Philippine Commonwealth and the Negrosanon Guerrillas, it was almost destroyed but went through rehabilitation and development efforts under succeeding mayors.
