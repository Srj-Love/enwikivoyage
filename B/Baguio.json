From there, it's back to the old McArthur Highway until Rosario Junction, La Union. Motorists drive through the provinces of Bulacan, Pampanga, Tarlac and Pangasinan and La Union (if via Marcos Highway) or Benguet (if via Kennon Road). Of the three main routes leading up to Baguio, scenic Kennon Road is the shortest taking only three-quarters to one hour from the foot of the mountains in Rosario, Pangasinan. Marcos Highway starts in Pugo, La Union (a little further to the northwest from Rosario) and takes about one hour but is a wider, less winding road with a more gradual uphill incline and is safer in the rainy season.  It has spectacular vistas of the South China Sea on a clear day. Naguillan Road is usually taken by travellers from the north and will take longer.\n\nAll three roads can get blocked by landslides and Kennon Road with its long winding stretches is both scenic and dangerous. If you are intent on driving to Baguio, it would be best to hire a Filipino driver for this purpose. Most rental car companies in the Philippines offer chauffeur driven rentals in addition to the usual self-driven rentals. Visitors need to keep in mind that while it takes at average 6-7 hr to get to Baguio by car, it takes much longer during holiday weekends like Holy Week.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By jeepney"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Jeepney.jpg"],["350px"],["thumbnail"],["right"],["Jeepney - public transportation"]]},"\n\nSimilar to Manila, jeepneys ply various routes within Baguio and its immediate surroundings.

It is possible to a rent a jeepney but it is not advisable when trekking long distances.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\n\nMore convenient for tourists perhaps, taxis are also common but once you are in the outskirts may be a bit hard to come by.\n\nTaxis abound in Baguio. Currently, the rate flags down at 35 pesos for the first 500 m, with 1.50 pesos\/100 m increments thereafter. All Baguio taxi cabs are painted white and have the proper identification markings on them. Maximum capacity in each taxi is 5 persons (4 passengers, 1 driver).\n\nTaxis can also be booked for a whole day tour at 1,800-2,000 pesos for a 8-9 hr tour of all the main attractions in and around town. Find a taxi at the Tourist Information Counter at the Victory Liner terminal or through your place of accommodation.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nCar rental in Baguio is a good option for short out-of-town trips and traveling around the city. There are several agencies offering car hire in Baguio and there are both self-drive and with driver options available. To rent a car in Baguio you should have an international driver's license. Baguio usually involves navigating a series of winding mountain roads.The traffic is on the right side of the road. As the Session Road and the public market have a very limited parking space, consider leaving your car outside the city center. Rates for car rental Baguio companies can go by the hour, the day or by the week.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Camp John Hay"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat=16.40278"],["long=120.61639"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=This former R&R facility for American military personnel during the American occupation was turned over to the Philippine Government in 1991.
