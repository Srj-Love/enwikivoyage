In Portuguese (Brazil's Official Language) the word \"bay\" is translated \"baia\". Salvador, Bahia's capital, was founded by Portuguese explorers in 1549. The city lays on a peninsula located in between \"All Saints Bay\" and the Atlantic Ocean. Every time people talked about Salvador, they referred to it as, \"the province with the bay in it\". Later on, the province would be officially named \"The Province of Bahia\" (the province of the bay). The spelling of the word \"bay\" (baia) was changed in order to make the province's name unique. Salvador-Bahia became Brazil's first capital back when the country was one of Portugal's colonies, and remained like that for 214 years (until it was transferred to Rio, and finally to Brasilia).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nBahians, like all Brazilians, speak Portuguese.
