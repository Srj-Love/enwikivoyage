[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Bahía de los Ángeles"]}," (\"Bay of Angels\") is a coastal bay on the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sea of Cortez"]]},", located along the eastern shore of the baja peninsula in the state of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Baja California"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mexico"]]},". The town of the same name is located at the east end of Federal Highway 12 about 42 miles (68 km) from the Parador Punta Prieta junction on Federal Highway 1.\n\nDuring high season most people get here via private yacht or fishing boat.  If you are yachting up and down the Sea of Cortez, Bahia de LA is an obvious place to stop and get off. You can get a cold beer, hot food and the mooring is good.\n\nThe road from HWY 1 is good and is the other way to get in.  It's a long trek in from HWY 1 though and there's really no there there so not so many people do.  The road is mostly used by trucks that bring in supplies to the yachters and fishermen.\n\nBahía de los Ángeles Airport (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["BHL"]]},") is a paved airstrip located 2 miles North of town which handles general aviation services.\n\nThere are several other primitive airstrips in the area.  Like most primitive airstrips in remote areas of Mexico—extreme discretion is advised.  Even local planes that are not carrying contraband may be armed and suspicious as protection against those who are (and the equally dangerous Federales).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nHike 3 miles in the mountains and see an old mine that is awesome\n\nThe bay is famous for its Whale Sharks.
