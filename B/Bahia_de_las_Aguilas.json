Fishing is technically illegal within the national park but is done on a small scale by the locals. (hence the abundance of sea life). The nearest town is Perdenales, and there are a couple of small little \"motels\" that are generally used by truckers.

Established as a National Park in 1983, it is now a UNESCO-recognized natural reserve. The beach is recognized by many Dominicans as \"The most majestic beach in the world\".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\nIt is a great representation of the Hispaniolan Dry Forest Ecoregion's coast. The entire area is an extremely arid landscape, much like many parts of Arizona or Baja California. There are no palm trees as in much of the rest of the country, hence there is no shade and extreme caution should be taken against exposure to the sun.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\nOn the way to the beach, if you're going through the park itself, green iguanas and several species of cactuses are common sightings, as well as many caves and water holes that exist in the heavy coral rock formations.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nClimate is semi-arid, as this part of the Dominican Republic is the driest. Skin protection is strongly recommended.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nYou can either get to the beach through the National Park itself with an all-wheel-drive vehicle (a 4-door sedan won't make it, since you won't be going through a paved road; it is almost like going through the Australian Outback) (Note: Park rangers indicated that a 4WD SUV is now insufficient for driving up to the beach and they said the road is impassable.) or by walking a couple of miles (think carefully before attempting that).\n\nYou can also get to the beach with a boat at Cabo Rojo (Spanish for Red Cape or Point ), which is near the entrance to the park. Once you get to Cabo Rojo, there's a restaurant called \"La Cueva\" (Spanish for \"The Cave\") that also has a few boats that will take you to the beach for a reasonable price. The ride takes about 10-15 minutes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\nThe fee to enter the park is around 30 Dominican Pesos (less than $1.00 US). If you're getting to the beach via a boat, it will cost around 500-2000 Dominican Pesos per boat, depending on the number of passengers in the boat, (from USD $20-70) usually including the park's entrance fee.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nOnce on the beach, you'll enjoy some of the whitest and softest sands on any beach in the world. Snorkeling is also highly recommended in Bahia de las Aguilas, although if you don't bring your own gear you will not find any there, as there are no stores or any type of services whatsoever.There is nothing but the beach,the bay and the surrounding extremely arid landscape,so caution is advised and drinking water should be brought along for the time spent. If arriving by boat, an agreed upon pickup time will be made and if one walks in or attempts to drive in, then one is completely on their own.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThe millions of sea shells on the shore of the beach as well as the abundant sea life just feet into the water.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nSwim, snorkel, walk, explore.

Less than $10 USD per person for a meal. The locals will go out, catch a fresh red snapper and cook it on the grill for you. There are also a couple of restaurants in Perdenales.
