Although trees grow in Bahrain, this one is special because of its location in the middle of the desert amidst the oil wells and other infrastructure of the petroleum industry.

You will eventually see a sign for the Tree of Life indicating a right turn.  (Although the sign seems to point you to turn onto a dirt road which actually goes nowhere, do not do so, instead wait until the next intersection which is several metres ahead).  There are no signs as you travel down this road, but pay attention to a scrap metal yard on your right.  Before you reach a hill which warns you of a steep 10% incline, take a right.  As you continue straight down this road (including roundabouts), you will begin to see Tree of Life signs again.  The signs will lead you down a road which will then be devoid of these signs, but you will eventually see the tree in the distance on the right (it is large and wide, not to be mistaken for other smaller trees along the way).  You turn onto a dirt path at Gas Well #371.  You can drive up to just outside of the tree, but make sure you stay on the vehicle-worn path, as turning off of it is likely to get your car stuck in the softer sand.\n\nAlthough it seems like a chore to reach, the Tree of Life is worth the visit for the oddity of it.  The tree is covered in graffiti, although this is not visible until you get up close.

Denominations for coins are 5 fils, 10 fils, 25 fils, 50 fils and 100 fils. Denominations for banknotes are 500 fils (BD 1\/2), BD 1, BD 5, BD 10 and BD 20. \n\nThe dinar is pegged to the Saudi riyal at 1:10, and riyals are accepted almost everywhere at that rate, although odds are you'll get your change in dinars and hotels may try to screw you out of a few percent.  If coming in from Saudi, there's no reason to change your money, but do try to get rid of any excess dinars before you leave the country, as they're hard to exchange elsewhere, even in Saudi.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Costs"]},"\nLike most Gulf countries, Bahrain is not cheap.

A minority of expats work in  the financial sector however the majority are engaged as labourers, policemen, drivers and lower class lowly paid artisans.   Conditions for many of these people are poor and there are regular alegations of human rights abuses and 'Modern Day Slavery'.\n\nFor some expats, life is easy with the clubs, cocktail parties, dinners and balls which remain one of the last throwbacks to the British empire.  However for others it is extremely hard and dangerous. In former times is was the tradition that employers provided benefits to expat employees including;\n# House or housing allowance\n# Medical insurance\n# Free flights home every year\n# An additional salary of a minimum of 15 days for every year worked (there are slabs according to the number of years worked)\n\nHowever, this is widely no longer true with 'Lump sum' self-sufficiency 'local hire'contracts now becoming the norm.\n\nAt present, there is a 1% charge on salary (gosi tax) which goes to subsidize the unemployed, but a lot of employers are giving their employees an additional bonus by paying it themselves instead of deducting it from the salary. \n\nSome executive positions used to have their children's education sponsored however this is now dwindling. \n\nWorking hours differ across different industries. Government offices work from 7:30 to 2:00 and the private sector now tends to be 7-30 to 1800 or much longer for Asian expatriates. Friday and Saturday is the official weekend for all public sector establishments as well as government schools and universities.\n\nOne of the major difficulties for expatriates in Bahrain is debt.   The economy is in many ways structured to encourage expats to live right on the edge of their earnings and it is virtually impossible for most people to save money.   There are legal processes which result in a global travel ban being placed on expatriates in a matter of minutes if they are unfortunate enough to get into debt.   An effect of the travel ban is that the work permit is automatically suspended thus meaning that the expatriate can not work to pay off the debt not can he \/ she leave the country.  Many expats have been stuck in Bahrain for years caught in this dilemma and a significant number have died in the country unable to travel for treatment or afford medical bills.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nDuring 2011, a state of near civil war broke out in Bahrain, with many deaths, hundreds of injuries, and a large number of activists and health professionals arrested and tortured.  Though massive demonstrations were brutally put down, the atmosphere remains tense, and demonstrations, riots, and shootings by the police may recur at any time.  Travellers should avoid the rural areas and the villages to the northwest of the country.  Large demonstrations can occur at any time, can sometimes become violent but are typically not anti-Western.  Avoid areas where crowds of people appear to be assembling.\n\nThe ordinary social crime rate in Bahrain is low and violent crime is rare. However, burglary, petty theft, and robberies do occur. Incidents of petty crime such as pickpocketing and bag snatching are reported especially in the old market areas known as souks. Most hotels have discos frequented by some unsavoury characters. Though the hotels have proper security systems including cameras installed, there are instances of tourists having their rooms burgled.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\n\nDrink plenty of water.  April through August can be very hot (up to 50 ºC) and humid. Use an umbrella to protect you from the harsh sun. It is important to stay hydrated, especially if you are outdoors during the day.   Bottled water is sold practically everywhere in the city from \"Cold Stores\" and small restaurants at very reasonable prices.  In the souk, walking vendors offer small chilled bottles but you may end up paying more than the bottle is really worth.

When out in places where local Arabs can be found it is advisable to wear long trousers, rather than shorts, and women shouldn't wear a see-through dress. However, in beach clubs and hotels, swimsuits, bikinis and shorts are okay to wear. Do not show signs of affection to members of the opposite sex in public. People of the opposite sex have been arrested for kissing in public and it is just not socially accepted.
