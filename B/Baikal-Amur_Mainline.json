It then goes parallel to the Trans-Siberian Railway all the way to the Pacific Ocean. You can expect great landscapes, admirable views of Baikal lake and a lot of high bridges and tunnels.\n\nThe railway was built primarily for military reasons as a backup to the Trans-Siberian, which runs quite close to the Chinese border.  The first stage, from 1930 to 1953, was built largely by Gulag prisoners, including German and Japanese prisoners of war, and an estimated 150,000 people died in the process.  Work halted due to Stalin's death, but started again in 1974 as a Komsomol project, this time \"with clean hands only\" (in Brezhnev's words).  The line was officially completed in 1984, although actual work continued until 1991.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Prepare"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Rail_Terminal_and_Station_Tynda.JPG"],["thumb"],["Tynda station"]]},"\n\nWhile ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tayshet"]]}," is the official starting point of the BAM, most travelers coming from Western Russia start their journey at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Irkutsk"]]},", the nearest large city.

It is also not fully electrified. BAM was a huge Soviet project, and workers from all parts of the Soviet Union were brought to construct it.  While traveling on the train pay attention to station buildings. Often they symbolize (in their architecture) the region from where the building crew came. Many of these workers married and stayed there, so you can find settlers from distant parts of the former Soviet Union along the line.\n\nA number of years ago, there were rumors about construction of a second track and another wave of workers came seeking work and remained. Construction didn't start. \n\nSometimes trains stop at turnouts in remote locations to let trains from the other direction pass.\nThere are a few passenger trains going from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]}," all the way to the Pacific; however, there are many local trains, with the main \"traffic\" being wood transports from the Siberian
