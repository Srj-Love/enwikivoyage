It is well worth a visit if you are in the area.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nBako offers outstanding diversity of natural landscapes in a relatively small area. Its beautifully dense rainforests and stunning beaches are home to many flora and fauna including the rare proboscis monkey. Try and spot them during low tide as they forage in the exposed Mangrove tree swamps. There are 16 color-coded jungle trails as well as lodges for overnight stays - which you have to book early. On the high ground, look out for pitcher plants. And beware of the monkeys, they are very clever and compulsive thieves! (Don't forget to spot the boar!)\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nBako is the oldest national park in Sarawak, established in 1957.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\nBako consists of coastal cliffs and rolling hills, and boasts fine sandy beaches surrounded by jungle. Coastal erosion has produced interesting sea stacks and rock formations.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and Fauna"]},"\nIn particular, Bako is famous as a home to around 150 of the highly endangered proboscis monkey. Macaques are more fearless as well as more common, and thus much easier to spot. Another distinctive mammal indigenous to Borneo is the bearded boar. The common monitor lizard, growing up to 2m long, is the largest of the park's many types of lizard; flying lizards may also sometimes be spotted\n\nWildlife is most active just before dusk, which means that an overnight stay may be needed to fully appreciate it.\n\nBako contains almost every type of vegetation to be found in Sarawak, including highly distinctive carnivourous plants. There are seven distinct types of ecosystem: beach vegetation, cliff vegetation, heath forest (kerangas), mangrove forest, mixed dipterocarp forest, grasslands vegetation (padang) and peat swamp forest\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nBako enjoys sunny weather much of the year. Temperature is constant throughout the year, in the lowland range from a cool 23C in the evening and early morning to 33C under the shade during the day. But from late November to late January, the monsoon rain may spoil plans for an outing. The hottest months are usually from June to late August, when the tribal farmers do their slash-and-burn land clearing before planting their padi, this has been blamed for the haze that envelops the regions and may cause health hazards. But since the governments of both Malaysia and Indonesia have \"banned\" open burning, incidents of haze have been reduced somewhat.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe journey to Bako has two stages; the first stage can be made overland but the park itself is reached only by boat.\n\nA bus ride from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kuching"]]}," to Bako Bazar (Bako Market) takes about 45â€“60 minutes (public bus number 1, originating from the wet market) and costs RM3.50 each way.  Buses leave to\/from Bako about once every hour starting from about 7AM from Kuching and finishing about 6PM from Bako, but the schedule is not firm. There is a daily schedule at the bus station 1 in Kuching (next to the open market, near the main mosque) in the morning. Or alternatively a copy can be obtained from the Tourist Office, which details bus company details.\n\nThe other travel option is by minivan, which departs from the same location as the bus throughout the day. Minivans depart when full, or when the waiting passengers offer the driver enough money. A minivan can be chartered for around RM30, and seats 5-7 people. They can reach Bako in half the time of the public bus. Note that the minivan driver may try to mislead you, claiming that the last bus to Kuching will not show up. In such a case, politely ask him to wait until 17:30 and see.\n\nHotels and tour operators also offer regular shuttle buses; as a pricier but more reliable alternative.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Boat"]},"\nWhen you arrive at the Bako Market right in front of the jetty\/visitor center, register, purchase your entrance ticket (RM20), and buy your boat ticket (RM94 round trip per boat, max. 5 passengers). The 20 minute ride on small motor launches is all part of the Bako experience as you pass through stunning scenery, but it isn't for the faint hearted (sit further back if you don't enjoy a bumpy ride). Depending on tides, you may either be deposited at a small jetty on the northern end of the headquarter's beach or on the beach opposite them (take your shoes off and prepare to wade).\n\nTell your boatman when you plan to return (or take his phone number to call him) and he'll wait for you at the dock. Note that the boatmen are a small, close-knit community and so other boatmen are likely to refuse to take your group if you are waiting for a previously agreed pickup, even if he is late.\nDeparture times might depend on the tides (boats do get stuck at low tide), and the weather, as the small speedboats are ill-suited to stormy conditions.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\n\nAs of June 2012, a new two-tier pricing system is in place.

Staying on or close to the marked trails is strongly advised. Boardwalks and ladders are installed to help with some of the more difficult stretches.\n\nSmall boats similar to those that take you to and from the park wait on the beaches at busy times of day and can be chartered to take you to other beachside destinations. A boat pick-up can also be arranged to help ease the return journey from some of the park's longer trails that finish on beaches. \nPulau Lakei, some distance offshore, can only be reached by boat.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Bako National Park 2006.jpg"],["200px"],["View of the park"]]},"\nA wide range of animal, bird and plant life including the Proboscis monkeys which come to the mangrove swamp to feed early evening.
