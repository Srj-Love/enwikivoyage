Angry with this incident Lord Shiva started the tandava nritya (dance of destruction). In order to prevent destruction of  all creation, Lord Vishnu used his Sudershan charka (wheel)  to cut the body of Sati into several parts. Sati's body was scattered all over what is presently the Indian subcontinent. There are 51 such holy spots where temples have been erected and they are called Pithas or the Shakti Pithas. Some of the Pithas are in West Bengal. The most popular of them are Kalighat (in Kolkata}, Bakreshwar and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tarapith"]]},".

Numerous Shiva temples surround the main temple, and a large number of temples are without any image.\nAccording to legend, the disfigured and disconsolate Astabkra {also known as the sage Lomas), out on a pilgrimage, arrived at Kasi (Varanasi) intent on worshipping Shiva. He was informed that his prayers could not be answered till they were offered at an undefined spot named Gupta Kasi (the hidden Varanasi) in the distant realm of Gaur (Bengal). Astabakra took to an eastern direction and ended at Bakreswar, where he adored Siva for ten thousand years. The god, touched by the persistence of his votary, declared that those who worshipped. Astabakra first and himself afterwards would be vouchsafed an endless store of blessings. Viswakarma, the architect of the gods, received a command to erect a temple on the auspicious spot, and a stately shrine soon rose on the eastern shore of the river Bakreswar containing two graven images, the larger of which represented Astabakra. There is no evidence of the present temple being such an ancient one. A tablet records that a portion of the edifice was erected by one Darpanarayan in the year 1761 A.D. \n\nThere are eight hot springs of varying temperatures.
