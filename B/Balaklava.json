This quaint sleepy town has an interesting history and is well worth a visit if you are in the Crimea. It is known in history for the \"Charge of the Light Brigade\", a near-suicidal attack by British cavalry against Russian cannon, which took place 4 km outside the town in 1854.\n\nThe town is overlooked by the remains of a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Genoa"],["Genoese"]]}," fortress; the Genoese used the port as a staging place for their lucrative trade in slaves and goods. Later the Mongols took it, and the Ottoman Empire took control of it in 1475. In the 1850s the harbor was filled with British troops and ships during the Crimean War.\n\nLater the Soviets built a submarine base into one of the hillsides, and turned the town into one of the most secret of locations during the Cold War era. In 1991 the base was closed and the last submarine left in 1996. And now it can be visited with a Russian-language guided tour. \n\nBalaklava is just waking up to its tourist potential and new hotels and restaurants are opening up. Balaklava is a mixture of luxury yachts moored next to expensive hotels and empty derelict factories and buildings dotted on the edge of the waterfront.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThere is a bus service from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sevastopol"]]},": take a number 9 marshrutka from the '5 km' bus interchange (2 UAH, September 2013), which you can reach by trolleybus 12 (1.25 UAH in September 2013) from central Sevastopol.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nYou can walk to most of the sites in the town - but from one side of the harbor to the other side is quite a trek.
