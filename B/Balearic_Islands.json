The journey takes just eight hours. By air the flight from Barcelona, Valencia, and Madrid takes less than an hour, while from París and London it takes under two. It is also possible to take vehicles to the islands aboard ferries specially designed for the purpose. Both air and sea services have extra flights and crossing during the \"high season\" (July 1st-September 30th),\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nIf you are visiting the centre of Palma your best bet is to go on foot. You can also hire scooters and bicycles if you prefer. If you decide to drive into the city from another part of the island, leave your car in one of the municipal car parks. You will be offered a bicycle (free of charge) to use to explore the city until you return to pick up your car.\nThere is one railway line in Majorca, departing from Palma which will take the traveller to a number of villages on the island. A quaint and antique wooden electric train departing from the main station in the Plaza de España will take you on a beautiful journey through the mountain range to the quaint village of Soller. If you prefer, you can hire a car.\nSchedules for bus train and ferries for all islands can be found on ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/horariodebus.es"]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nThe local cooking of the islands is exotic, exquisite and at the same time imaginatively presented.\n\nThe official Majorcan foodstuff should be a type of red pork pate called ",{"type":"[[","value":[["sobrasada"]]}," in Majorcan, sobrasada in Spanish.
