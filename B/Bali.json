However, the ticketing booth closes after the last flight arrival for the day and re-opens at 8AM, so anyone wanting an airport taxi during this period should be prepared to haggle or seek the alternatives described below.\n\nIf you are travelling on a restricted budget, you can flag down a Blue Bird Taxi from outside the airport gate (3–5 minutes walk from both terminals). Blue Bird Taxis are safe and reliable, and their metered fares are somewhat cheaper than the prepaid taxi fares. Depending on how much baggage you have and how bulky it is, you might want to evaluate whether all that extra effort is worth it to save a few dollars. Metered ride to Kuta, for example, would generally cost Rp 20,000-30,000.\n\nIf you do make the effort to walk outside the airport to the street, you can also flag down a ",{"type":"''","value":["bemo"]}," (local minivan). Most of the bemos in this area will be heading to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kuta"]]}," (road to Kuta heads to the left if looking out from the airport gate), but don't absolutely bank on it, and be prepared for a hot, crowded journey. It should cost no more than a few thousand rupiah per person (ask the driver beforehand). And if you are an alone backpacker you can try ojek (motorcycle taxi but no meter) in the first intersection outside of the airport (3 to 5 minutes walk) for a price (more) less than a half of taxi meter fare. If you are not sure a taxi can reach your hotel because of narrow streets, or you are not sure about the location, Ojek is a good option because they frequently use narrow streets to cut the length of the trip, use pedestrian paths and sometimes go against traffic on theoretically one-way streets. An ojek to Kuta costs Rp10,000 to Rp15,000.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nThere are direct bus services to Bali from all major cities on ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Java"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lombok"]]}," that link with ferries for sea crossings.

These are convenient for some travellers but are frequently priced much higher than the equivalent air crossing. Crossing times are subject to weather and other operational conditions and trip times can longer than those publicised.\n\nCaution should be used in selecting a suitable operator and craft for a ",{"type":"''","value":["fast boat"]}," crossing to Lombok. Some of the operators on these routes use inappropriate equipment, overload the boats and have inadequate levels of crew training, personnel and safety equipment. The Lombok Strait fast boat crossing can be subject to inclement weather and equipment breakdowns. Boarding an overloaded craft or departing in adverse weather conditions may lead to serious disappointment. Currently there are no operators offering craft suitable for open water all-weather crossings. Rather they are operating light duty hulled craft of fibreglass or aluminium construction powered by outboard petrol engines. On two previous occasions operators have introduced a more suitably specified and equipped craft powered by diesel inboard engines and with a more robust hull construction appropriate to open water use. Both these craft were withdrawn from service as operations could not be sustained in competition with the lower cost base alternatives. Several of these light duty craft have already sunk or been run onto a reef or beach to avoid foundering whilst carrying passengers. Fortunately they had not yet entered open waters at the time and nearby assistance was available. There have been no fatalities from these incidents.\n\nThere are also public ferries from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lembar"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lombok"]]},", to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Padang Bai"]]}," every few hours, with the trip taking around 3–4 hours.  This service has notable safety, operational and equipment standards issues. Some ferries are better than others, or worse depending upon your perspective.\n\nDelays are commonplace with the public ferries due to loading and unloading issues. Services may be cancelled or postponed during periods of inclement weather and it may be prudent to avoid sea crossings during the monsoonal period when sea conditions may lead to deteriorated comfort levels or a dangerous crossing.\n\nSee the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gili Islands"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lombok"]]}," articles for full details concerning travelling and arriving in Lombok and it's nearby islands.\n\nCruise ships occasionally stop so that passengers can tour or shop.  Some ships still anchor off-shore toward the southeast side of the island and tender guests to shore.  Modest-sized ships can choose to dock at the port of Benoa not far from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Denpasar"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kuta"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sanur"]]},".  The dock area is basically industrial, with few amenities and no ATMs, but taxis and private car operators are usually ready to whisk you to nearby destinations at a moderate cost, taxis should use their meters and private cars will sometimes require some patient negotiation on price.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Kecak Dance at Uluwatu.jpg"],["thumb"],["right300px"],["Kecak dance performance at Uluwatu"]]},"\n\nBali is a fairly large island and you will need a method to get around if you plan on exploring more than the hotel pool. Rapid, seemingly uncontrolled development and an aging infrastructure, mean that the roads struggle to cope. In major tourist areas the traffic is chaotic, and there are daily jams. Particular blackspots are ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ubud"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kuta"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Seminyak"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Denpasar"]]},".\n\nFor different excursions around the island, it is common to join a tour via your hotel or at one of the many street agencies which are found everywhere in booths normally marked \"Tourist Information\".\n\nOnce you arrive at your destination you may encounter difficult walking conditions as sidewalks in most parts of Bali are simply the covered tops of storm-water drains and in many places only 60 cm (2 ft) wide.  This makes for uncomfortable single-file walking next to traffic.  Often sidewalks are blocked by a motorbike or a caved-in section, necessitating dangerous darting into traffic.  Many of the island's conventional streets are simply not pedestrian-friendly.  Beach areas and major tourist areas are easier to walk around and Sanur in particular has a wide beachfront pathway with many cafes and bars.  But although the walking conditions are difficult, they are by no means impossible.  Lots of tourists and locals travel the roads by foot and even the traffic is generally very accommodating to pedestrians if it is given time to react.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/peramatour.com Perama"]}]}," bus company serves the budget traveller well in Bali and beyond, and they have offices in several major tourist destinations on the island.\n\nThere are other scheduled shuttle buses between many of Bali's most popular destinations, and these are cheap and reliable. Check locally advertised services (you cannot miss them) and book one day in advance.\n\nA new Trans Sarbagita government bus service operates on Bali since August 2011 ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/blog.baliwww.com\/bali-news-events\/30816"]},". The buses are comfortable, air-conditioned (similar to Transjakarta Busway but even more spacious), and the fare is only Rp 3,500. These buses stop only at permanent elevated bus stops built on the road curb. As of June 2012, only Route 2 was operating (Route 1 and Route 3 are planned to be open soon).\n\nThe buses serving Route 2 start from Batubulan bemo terminal, go via Jalan Bypass Ngurah Rai (stopping in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sanur"]]}," on the way) and Hanuman statue roundabout to Central Parkir Kuta (near Giant supermarket on Jalan Raya Kuta, a kilometer or so inland from the main tourist areas of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kuta"]]},"), make a loop via Sunset Road back to Hanuman statue, and go south all the way to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nusa Dua"]]},", then go back. For visitors, the main advantage is there's no need now to change bemos and to deal with 2-3 bemo drivers to get to Batubulan terminal (from where direct bemos to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ubud"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kintamani"]]}," and other north and north-eastern destinations are available) or to Sanur. Those going to Nusa Dua or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Benoa"]]}," may find the southern part of the route useful. The bus stop nearest to the airport is Central Parkir Kuta, a Blue Bird taxi caught outside of the airport gate will cost you around Rp 25,000. If boarding at Central Parkir Kuta, beware that both southbound (Nusa Dua) and northbound (Batubulan) buses seem to use the same stop - if no signs on the bus, ask the conductor or other people waiting for the bus.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\n\nMetered taxis are very common in southern Bali as far north as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Denpasar"]]}," but few and far between elsewhere.  The starting flagfall charge is Rp 5,000 for the first two kilometres and the meter ticks up Rp 5,000 per km after that.  Waiting time is charged at Rp 30,000 per hour.  Trips outside southern Bali will incur an extra charge of 30%, as the driver has to go back empty.\n\nBy far the largest and most reliable taxi company is ",{"type":"'''","value":["BlueBird"]}," Bali Taksi; they have a telephone call service ☎ +62 361 701111 for both instant taxis and advance bookings. If you are hailing a taxi on the street, Bluebird cars are sky blue with a white top light ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.bluebirdgroup.com\/passenger-transportation\/regular-taxi-blue-bird-pusaka\/safety-tips"]},". The cars are modern and the drivers well-informed with a decent level of English-language ability. There are several other reliable taxi companies but these are not always easy to identify. If entering a taxi with no working meter, you are probably being deceived, you can negotiate a price with the driver but it is unlikely to work to your favour. Always insist on the meter being turned on, do not believe stories that the taxi has no meter or that it is \"broken\" and leave the taxi if the request to use the meter is not met.\n\nIf day-tripping, it is often cheaper and more convenient to arrange for your taxi to wait and take you back.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bemo"]},"\n\nBemos are minivans which serve as a flexible bus service and are Bali's \"traditional\" form of transportation. However they have largely given way to metered taxis in the south. Fares on shared bemos can be very cheap, but drivers will often insist that foreign tourists charter the entire vehicle, in which case they will usually ask for a price equivalent to a taxi or even more.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By self-drive car or motorbike"]},"\n\nDriving in Bali is on the left-hand side. Car and motorbike rentals are widely available but you should think very carefully about your ability to handle driving in Bali with its lack of formal traffic rules. Consider hiring a car and driver as you can relax, be safe and not get lost. If you rent a car to drive yourself, a modern four door Toyota Avanza or Daihatsu Xenia should cost Rp 200,000-250,000 per day. If on a tighter budget, you should be able to get an old, rough Suzuki Jimny from about Rp 90,000 to 110,000 per day.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Seminyak Motorbikes.jpg"],["200px"],["right"],["thumb"],["Motorbikes for rent in Seminyak"]]},"\n\nRenting motorcycles or scooters can be a frightening yet fascinating experience. They are typically 125cc, some with automatic transmissions, and rent for between Rp 40,000 and 50,000 per day (for a week or more, cheaper price can be bargained). In areas outside of the tourist enclaves of south Bali, a motorbike is a wonderful way to see the island, but in south Bali, with its crush of traffic, the chances of an accident are greatly increased. Bali is no place to learn to ride a motorbike. But some of new surfer area are only accessable by a motorbike, and please remember also not all hotels have ample of parking lot for car.\n\nA word of warning when renting motorbikes. A sizeable number of travellers seem to leave their brains at home when visiting Bali and think it is acceptable to ride a motorbike through extremely busy streets in a foreign land without wearing a helmet. Obviously, it is not. You are both showing a great deal of arrogance as a guest in foreign country by thinking you are above the law of that country, and putting yourself at risk. When you rent a motorbike you will be given a helmet, so wear it.\n\nAn International Driving Permit (IDP) is required for vehicle rental, with a motorcycle endorsement if renting a motorbike, the IDP must match the licence class of home countryu issue and that must be appropriate to the vehicle being used, both documents must be carried. The IDP is seldom requested by the person renting you the vehicle but will be required (along with the vehicle's STNK registration papers). If stopped by the police typically a Rp 50,000 \"fine\" will allow you to keep driving but this strategy will quickly unravel if there is an accident involving damage or injury.  An IDP is easily available from motoring clubs in your home country such as AAA. The American Automobile Touring Alliance in the United States  provides them for around US$15 and it is valid for one year.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By rental car with a driver"]},"\n\nRental car services owned by individuals or companies are easy to find in Bali and this is the best option for first time visitors. Using a rental car with a driver is certainly cheaper than taxis and far more efficient than using other public transportation. The drivers are usually English-speaking and they can also act as informal tourist guides recommending good destinations and restaurants. Choosing to rent from a large car company is naturally more expensive than sourcing from a private individual. Ask hotel staff to recommend a good individually owned rental car with a knowledgeable driver. Drivers should hold a licence to operate a tourism transport vehicle otherwise there may be delays and inconvenience experienced if stopped by the police or other officials.\n\nPrice varies between Rp 300,000-600,000 per day (usually defined as 10 hr) depending on your negotiation skills and the class\/age of the car. Make sure the price includes petrol and driver for the day. Petrol costs, after the removal of some government subsidies in recent years, have escalated dramatically (although still very cheap by international standards) and the distance travelled is a factor if you have not fixed a daily price.  Entrance tickets to tourist destinations and any parking fees will be charged to you and it is good form to buy lunch for your driver. For those on a tight schedule, visiting most of the major tourist destinations in Bali will need about 3 days with a rental car and driver.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bicycle"]},"\n\nTravel by bicycle is quite possible and provides a very different experience than other means of transport. You should bring your own touring bike, or buy locally—there is at least one well stocked bike shop in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Denpasar"]]},", but with a racing\/mountain bike focus. Bicycles are also widely available for rent and some of the better hotels will even provide them free of charge. While traffic conditions may appear challenging at first, you will acclimatise after a few days, especially once you escape the chaotic heavy traffic of southern Bali. Rental bikes are a lot in Sanur which has pedestrian along the shore (more than 2 kilometers) and also can be used for your bike, but please stop for a moment when a lot of people walk in front of you.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Pura Ulun Danu Bratan A.JPG"],["thumb"],["right"],["300px"],["Part of the Ulun Danu Temple complex at Lake Bratan in Bedugul.

For the Balinese, the \"mother temple\" of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mount Agung#Besakih"],["Besakih"]]}," on the slopes of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mount Agung"]]}," is the most important of all and sits above the nine.

Local geography has a fundamental effect on design, and two temples are rarely the same. Everything you see, be it decorative or structural, has a specific, well-considered function which may be of an earthly or spiritual nature. There are, though, general elements which are common to the vast majority of temples, which are always split into three courtyards: ",{"type":"''","value":["jaba"]}," (outer courtyard), ",{"type":"''","value":["jaba tengah"]}," (middle courtyard) and  ",{"type":"''","value":["jeroan"]}," (inner courtyard). Each of these courtyards contains various structures and\/or shrines of differing levels of importance.\n\nThe tiered, black-thatched roofs that you see on temples are made from a palm fibre, and this material is not permitted to be used for any roof other than those on temples. The elegant, pagoda-like tiered structure is itself called a ",{"type":"''","value":["meru"]}," (named after sacred ",{"type":"''","value":["Mount Meru (Mahameru)"]},", the home of the gods), and the most dramatic of them can consist of as many as 11 tiers. The number of tiers, though, is ",{"type":"''","value":["always"]}," an odd number.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Bali temple diagram.png"],["right"],["thumb"],["220px"],["Example of a typical Balinese temple layout"]]},"\n\nThe temple entrance is always on the ",{"type":"''","value":["kelod"]}," axis point (facing ",{"type":"''","value":["away"]}," from Mount Agung) of the compound and is usually a gateway of some nature. This leads into the ",{"type":"''","value":["jaba"]}," which is the domain of humans and all things earthly. The jaba contains only minor shrines, is where some celebratory dance performances take place, and during special ceremonies is where the foods stalls are set up.

This houses the most important shrines to different Hindu gods and deities and is where serious rituals and prayers take place. Shrines are many and varied but usually include a ",{"type":"''","value":["padmasana"]},", the throne of the supreme deity ",{"type":"''","value":["Sanghyang Widi Wasa"]},". The large pavilion in this section  is called a ",{"type":"''","value":["gedong pariman"]},", which is always left completely empty to allow the gods to visit during ceremonies. Sometimes properly dressed visitors will be allowed into the jeroan and at other times not; it depends on the individual temple and the ceremonies that have been, or are about to be, performed.\n\nThe most common and practical architectural features to be found in virtually all temples are gazebo pavilions called ",{"type":"''","value":["bales"]},". Each has a raised seating section and either an ",{"type":"''","value":["alang-alang"]}," (grass-thatched) or ",{"type":"''","value":["tali duk"]}," (black palm fibre-thatched) roof and has a myriad of social functions.

Bintang is a fairly highly regarded classic light Asian beer, but Bali Hai is a rather bland lager, and despite the name it's actually brewed in a suburb of Jakarta.  The Bali-based microbrew ",{"type":"'''","value":["Storm"]}," is available in several different flavors, and the pale ale is especially good. The other local beer is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Anker"]},", and both ",{"type":"'''","value":["Carlsberg"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["San Miguel"]}," are brewed locally under license. A wide range of more expensive imported beers are available. Beer is relatively expensive in local terms, though still cheap by western standards; at Rp 15,000 and up a small bottle costs the same as a full meal in a local eatery.  In tourist centres, happy hours are widely publicised before and after sunset, with regular bottles of beer going for Rp 15,000-20,000 and the large bottles for Rp 20,000-30,000.\n\nBali produces its own wines, with ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.hattenwines.com\/ Hatten"]}]}," being the oldest and most popular brand, available in white, red, rose (most popular) and sparkling varieties.  Quality is inconsistent, but the rose is usually OK and massively cheaper than imported wines, which can easily top Rp 300,000 per bottle. Wine aficionados are better off bringing their own bottle in with them. Most restaurants will let you bring your own bottle and some will charge a modest corkage fee.  Smaller establishments likely will not have a corkscrew, so bring your own!\n\nBali also produces its own liqueurs and spirits, with ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bali Moon"]}," being the most popular. They offer a wide range of flavoured liqueurs: banana, blackcurrant, butterscotch, coconut, hazelnut, lychee,  melon, peppermint, orange, blue curacao, pineapple and coffee.  Vodka and other spirits are also produced locally, with Mansion House being the most popular brand. Be aware, though, that many of these local spirits are little more than flavoured rice liquor. Cocktails in Bali range from Rp 30,000 in small bars to Rp 100,000 in high end establishments. Bali Moon cocktails are available in almost every bar, restaurant and hotel in Bali. Liqueurs are available in many retail outlets; just enquire within if you wish to have fun making your own cocktails.\n\nBali's traditional hooches are ",{"type":"'''","value":["arak"]},", a clear distilled spirit that packs a 40° punch; ",{"type":"'''","value":["brem"]},", a fermented rice wine sold in gift shops in attractive clay bottles that are much nicer than the taste of the stuff inside; and ",{"type":"'''","value":["tuak"]},", a palm 'wine' which is often served at traditional festivities. Visitors should be ",{"type":"''","value":["extremely"]}," careful about where they purchase arak, as there have been a number of serious poisoning cases and even some deaths involving tainted arak.\n\nTap water in Bali is not generally drinkable and if so it is hard to ascertain it's quality. Bottled water is universally available and inexpensive (Rp 3,500 or so for a 1.5 litre bottle); restaurants usually use commercially purified water for cooking. The most popular brand is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Aqua"]}," and that name is often used generically for bottled water. Filtered water shops are also common, providing on-site treatment of the mains water to a potable standard. This is known as ",{"type":"''","value":["air putih"]}," (literally \"white water\"). These shops are much cheaper than retail outlets, selling water for about Rp 5,000 per 11-litre reusable container, and they avoid the waste created by plastic bottles.\n\n",{"type":"''","value":["Fresh fruit juices'"]}," cost from Rp 10,000 upwards and their mixes may include watermelon, melon, papaya, orange, lime, banana or almost any other fruit you can think of.  In Bali, avocado (",{"type":"''","value":["alpukat"]},") is used as a dessert fruit.  Blended with sugar, a little water and ice—and sometimes chocolate syrup—this is a beverage you will rarely find elsewhere. If you do not drink alcohol, Bali's fresh juices in various creative combinations will please you no end.

Further north on the west coast is the district of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Canggu"]]},", which offers many traditional villages set among undulating ricefields and a good range of accommodation. For rest and revitalisation, visit ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amed"]]},", an area of peaceful fishing villages on the east coast with some good hotels and restaurants, or head for the sparsely populated areas of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["West Bali"]]},".\n\nThanks to Bali's balmy climate, many hotels, bungalows and villas offer ",{"type":"'''","value":["open-air bathrooms"]},", often set in a lush garden.  They look amazing and are definitely a very Balinese experience, but they may also shelter little uninvited guests and are best avoided if you have a low tolerance for critters.\n\nBali hotel prices may be given in ",{"type":"'''","value":["three different currencies"]},". Prices in U.S. dollars are most common, particularly away from the budget sector. Euros are sometimes used, particularly at hotels owned by European nationals. Lower-end places usually (but not always) price in Indonesian Rupiah. If you pay your bill by credit card, then the amount in the currency you agreed to when making the booking is converted to Indonesian Rupiah on the day you pay and your account is charged with that amount of Rupiah. This is because Indonesian banking law does not permit credit card transactions in any other currency. If you pay by cash, you can settle with the currency in which you were quoted the room rate.\n\nIt is generally best to seek a rate in Indonesian Rupiah and resist efforts by the hotels and villa owners to quote in a foreign currency unless you are able to make payment in the currency and it is agreeable to you to do so.\n\nIt is important to understand the tax and service charge that hotels are obliged to levy by Indonesian law. All high-end and mid-range (and a fair proportion of budget) hotels will levy a 21% tax and service charge on the room rate (the so-called \"plus plus\"). When you make a booking, you should always ask whether the rate quoted includes or excludes this. Simple budget homestays\/losmen and informal accommodation are not obliged to levy these charges. The 21% consists of 11% sales tax which goes to the government and a 10% service charge which should go into a pool shared between the staff.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Private villas"]},"\n\nBali has become famous for its large collection of ",{"type":"'''","value":["private villas"]}," for rent, complete with staff and top-class levels of service.  Low labour costs result in single villas boasting staff teams of up to 30 people at the really high end.  A private villa rental can be a great option for a visit to Bali, but it pays to be aware of the potential pitfalls.\n\nNot every place sold as a villa actually fits the bill.  Prices vary widely and some operators claim to go as low as US$30 per night (which usually means a standalone bungalow on hotel grounds with little actual privacy). Realistically, you will be looking at upwards of US$200 per night for anything with a decent location and a private pool.  At the top of the range, nightly rents can easily go north of US$1,000.  The general rule of ",{"type":"'''","value":["you get what you pay for"]}," applies here.  There are, of course, exceptions, but a 4 bedroom villa offered for US$400 and one for US$800 per night will be different in many ways—the standard of maintenance, the number of staff and their English ability, and the overall quality of furnishings and fittings in the property.\n\nLook carefully as to who is running the villa. Is it run by the owner, a local company, a western company or by local staff who answer to an absent overseas owner? And who you are renting through—directly from the owner, a management company, an established villa agent or one who just opened a month ago after his friend Nyoman told him how easy it was? Each path has its pros and cons.  If it is an agency, see if there are press reviews. Ask how long the villa has been taking commercial guests, as villas normally take a year or so to get to best service levels.  In the first six to 12 months of operation, great villas may offer introductory rates that are well below market value to gain awareness. In all circumstances thoroughly examine and query the security arrangements, especially if dealing with an apparently inexperienced or opportunistic operator to ensure you are not exposing yourself or your belongings to any unnecessary risks.\n\nMany Private villas are found in the greater Seminyak area (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Seminyak"]]},", Umalas, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Canggu"]]},"), in the south around ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jimbaran"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Uluwatu"]]},", in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sanur"]]}," and around the hill town of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ubud"]]}," as well as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lovina"]]}," in north Bali .

Restaurants, shops and bars frequented by Bali's sizable expatriate community, particularly in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Seminyak"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sanur"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ubud"]]},", are good places to find information about long-term rentals. Look for a bulletin board with property advertisements tacked up or pick up a copy of the local expat biweekly publication, ",{"type":"''","value":["The Bali Advertiser"]}," ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.baliadvertiser.biz\/"]},". Remember that with a year-round tourism trade, villas that have everything right are usually available for more lucrative short-term rental only.  Long-term rental houses tend to be older and not as well maintained.  If you are willing to be flexible, though, you can find nice house options over a wide range of budgets.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Stay safe "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Uluwatu BabyMonkey.JPG"],["thumb"],["Behind the cuddly façade lies a cunning thief"]]},"\n\nBali is, in general, a safe destination, and few visitors encounter any real problems.\n\nBali was the scene of lethal ",{"type":"'''","value":["terrorist bombings"]}," in 2002 and 2005, with both waves of attacks targeting nightclubs and restaurants popular among foreign visitors.  Security is consequently tight at obvious targets, but it is of course impossible to protect oneself fully against terrorism.  If it is any reassurance, the Balinese themselves—who depend on tourism for their livelihood—deplored the bombings and the terrorists behind them for the terrible suffering they have caused on this peaceful island. As a visitor, it is important to put the risk in perspective: the sad fact is that Bali's roads are, statistically, far more dangerous than even the deadliest bomb. It may still be prudent to avoid high-profile western hang-outs, especially those without security measures. The paranoid or just security-conscious may wish to head out of the tourist enclaves of South Bali to elsewhere on the island.\n\nBali is increasingly enforcing Indonesia's harsh penalties against the import, export, trafficking and possession of ",{"type":"'''","value":["illegal drugs"]},", including marijuana, ecstasy, cocaine and heroin. Several high profile arrests of foreigners have taken place in Bali since 2004, and a number have been sentenced to lengthy prison terms or (very rarely) execution. Even the possession of a small amount of drugs for personal use puts you at risk of a trial and prison sentence.  Watch out for seemingly harmless street boys looking to sell you drugs (marijuana, ecstasy, cocaine, etc.).  More often than not, they are working with undercover police and will try to sell you drugs so that they can then get uniformed officers onto you. The police officers will (if you are lucky) demand a bribe for your release, or, more likely, look for a far larger payday by taking you into custody. Just avoid Bali's drug scene ",{"type":"''","value":["at all costs"]},".\n\nThe unfortunate people who are caught and processed will find there is little distinction between personal use and dealing in the eyes of the Indonesian legal system. 'Expedition fees', monies paid to shorten jail or prison time, can easily run to US$20,000 and are often a lot more.\n\nThere is a fair chance that you will be offered ",{"type":"'''","value":["magic mushrooms"]},", especially if you are young and find yourself in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kuta"]]},". Indonesian law is a little unclear in this area but with the whole country in the midst of a drug crackdown since 2004, it is not worth taking the risk.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Bali Swimming Flag.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["250px"],["Don't swim near the red flags"]]},"\n\nIf you see a ",{"type":"'''","value":["red flag"]}," planted in the sand, do not swim there, as they are a warning of dangerous ",{"type":"'''","value":["rip currents"]},".  These currents can pull you out to sea with alarming speed and even the strongest swimmers cannot swim ",{"type":"''","value":["against"]}," them. The thing to do is to stay calm and swim sideways (along the shore) until out of the rip and only then head for the shore.  The ocean is not to be trifled with in Bali, and dozens of people, some experienced some not, die by drowning every year.\n\nPetty ",{"type":"[[","value":[["common scams"],["scams"]]}," are not uncommon, although they can usually be avoided with a modicum of common sense.  If approached on the street by anybody offering a deal on souvenirs, transport, etc., you can rest assured that you will pay ",{"type":"''","value":["more"]}," if you follow your new found friend.  Guard your bags, especially at transport terminals and ferry terminals. In addition to the risk of them being stolen, self-appointed porters like to grab them without warning and then insist on ridiculous prices for their \"services\".\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Timeshare scams"]}," and schemes are common in Bali with several high profile, apparently legitimate operators. If you are approached by a very friendly street canvasser asking you to complete a survey and then attend a holiday resort presentation to claim your 'prize' (this is inevitably a 'free' holiday which you end up paying for anyway), politely refuse and walk away. You may also be cold-called at your hotel to be told you have 'won a holiday' - the caller may even know your name and nationality thanks to a tip-off from someone who has already seen your data. If you fall for this scam, you will be subjected to a very long, high-pressure sales presentation and if you actually buy the 'holiday club' product, you will certainly regret it. Timeshare is a completely unregulated industry in Indonesia, and you have no recourse.\n\nWhen leaving Bali, if you have anything glass in your baggage (such as duty-free alcohol) the security guards may put some pressure on you to have it wrapped to keep it safe, and it can seem like its a requirement rather than a suggestion (it is Rp 60,000 a bag). Similarly, when arriving in Bali, some uniformed airport porters may offer to take your bags for you and walk you through customs, be generally friendly and helpful, and then demand a tip.  The charge is Rp 5,000, a request for any amount in excess of this has no formal sanction, it is best to stop them from interfering with your bags in any way, just tell them you do not want their services unless you are sure you want to use them, if so clarify the price before the lift up your bags. These 'services' are best avoided.\n\nThe money changing rule is simple: ",{"type":"'''","value":["use only authorised money changers"]}," with proper offices and always ask for a receipt. The largest is called PT Central Kuta and they have several outlets. If you are especially nervous, then use a formal bank. You may get a better rate at an authorised money changer though.\n\nAvoid changing money in smaller currency exchange offices located within shops, as they more often than not will try to steal money by using very creative and \"magician\" like methods. Even when you think you've watched the dealers every move, you're not unlikely to end up with far too low an amount in your hands, so just take a minute to re-count your stack of bills at the spot. Often the rate advertised on the street is nowhere near the rate that they will give you in the end. Many times the rate is set higher to lure you in so that they can con you out of a banknote or two, and when this is not possible, they will give you a shoddy rate and state that the difference is due to commission. This even applies to the places which clearly state that there is no commission, of course any money changer charges a commission, they would cease to be viable if they did not and it is built into the differential between the purchase rate and the sell rate at any given time.\n\nFor many, ",{"type":"''","value":["the"]}," largest irritant will be the hawkers and peddlers who linger around temples, malls, beaches, and anywhere tourists congregate. It may feel difficult or rude to ignore the constant come-ons to buy souvenirs, food, and assorted junk, but it can be necessary in order to enjoy your holiday in semi-peace.\n\nLast but not least be wary around the ",{"type":"'''","value":["monkeys"]}," that occupy many temples (most notably ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Uluwatu"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ubud"]]},"'s Monkey Forest).  They are experts at stealing possessions like glasses, cameras and even handbags, and have been known to attack people carrying food.  Feeding them is just asking for trouble.\n\nRabies is present in Bali and several deaths arising from rabies infections have been recorded in early 2011. Visitors to the island should avoid contact with dogs, cats, monkeys and other animals that carry the disease. If bitten seek medical attention.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\n\nAlthough the standards of ",{"type":"'''","value":["healthcare and emergency facilities"]}," have improved greatly in recent years, they remain below what most visitors would be accustomed to in their home country. Whilst minor illness and injury can be adequately treated in the ubiquitous local clinics most overseas visitors would not be comfortable having serious problems dealt with in a local hospital, and insurance coverage for emergency medical evacuation is therefore a wise precaution. If a medical evacuation is required then patients are normally moved to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Singapore"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Perth"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Australia"]]},". ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jakarta"]]},", Indonesia's capital, does however have some high standard medical care facilities if seeking medical attention at a closer location.\n\nBe aware that the purchase of travel insurance still means that most clinics and hospitals may require payment in advance, or sometimes by incremental payment as various services are rendered. This may require access to a quite significant amount of cash to keep things moving. Any claim is then made to the insurance company upon your return home. This is almost always the case if the problem is one that can be dealt with on an outpatient basis. Make sure that your insurance company has an agreement with the provider or immediately establishes one, otherwise you will also be landed with a bill for an inpatient stay. Bali International Medical Centre (BIMC) has agreements with many insurance companies and is a well serviced hospital. This is however a relatively expensive option and even they ask for payment for outpatient treatments.\n\nThe major travel insurance companies may be slow to respond with appropriate assistance and equally slow to refer a claimant to a suitable medical service. Delays may also be experienced if the insurer is slow or indecisive in authorising treatment. Difficulties may arise from an insurer not authorising a ",{"type":"''","value":["payment guarantee"]}," to the local medical services provider. Delays in rendering appropriate treatment are a common outcome. Try to gain a comprehensive understanding of the policy terms and limitations of your travel insurance cover well prior to departing your home country. Trying to gain an understanding of the limitations of cover whilst amidst a crisis is not recommended.\n\nSome travel insurance companies and their ",{"type":"''","value":["emergency response"]}," centres may not live up to your own expectations of regional knowledge, appropriate case management and speedy response. Your best insurance is always common-sense, some basic  ",{"type":"''","value":["pre-departure"]}," research on your destination and the application of good situational awareness whilst travelling. Try to have your own plan in place to deal with any crisis you may encounter when travelling rather than relying solely upon a possibly inadequately skilled and under-qualified person sitting in a distant call centre who may have their own role complicated by problems with language, communication and access to the insurers decision makers. You may wish to consider carrying the names and contact numbers of one or two of the major local medical and evacuation providers in your wallet or purse so that you know how to quickly obtain medical assistance should an emergency arise. Always ensure that you contact your insurer ",{"type":"'''","value":["as soon as possible"]}," should an emergency arise otherwise you may find they are later unwilling to accept liability for payment for any expenses that arise.",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\nAlways keep a thorough record of all ependitures and communications with your insurer and obtain full and detailed invoices and receipts for all services provided and any incidental costs. If you do not understand the detail of anything that you are billed for ask for an explanation; if  information is not forthcoming withhold payment or authorisation until such time as an acceptable explanation is given.\n\nInternational SOS Indonesia (AEA ",{"type":"''","value":["SOS"]}," Medika) ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.internationalsos.com\/en\/asia-pacific.htm"]}," was founded in Indonesia in 1984 and has grown into an international organisation handling a round 9 million cases per year. It has a professionally staffed and operated clinic in Bali. They offer clinic services, hospital referral and emergency medical evacuation services. They have agreements or associations in place with many of the major travel insurers and are a principal medical service supplier in the SE Asian region, including Indonesia.\n\nThe midday sun in Bali will fry the unwary traveller to a crisp, so slap on plenty of high-factor sun-protection and drink lots of fluids. However there is no need to carry litres of water as you can buy a bottle virtually anywhere. The locals tend to stay away from the beaches until about two hours before sunset, when most of the ferocity has gone out of the sun.\n\nTravelling to Bali may expose you to some risks in contracting one of many ",{"type":"[[","value":[["tropical diseases"]]}," that are present in the region. Bali is officially a ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["malaria"]]},"-free"]}," zone but ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["dengue fever"]]}]}," is a problem and all sensible precautions should be taken against being bitten by ",{"type":"[[","value":[["mosquitoes"]]},". Mosquitoes cannot fly far, only a hundred meter, so 4 star hotels as a standard do a weekly fumigation, but how about mosquitoes outside the hotels? \n\nTake care in restaurants and bars; although it is very rare nowadays, some may use untreated\/unsafe tap water to make ice for drinks otherwise made with clean ingredients.  Tap water in hotels should not be used for drinking or brushing teeth unless explicitly labelled as safe.\n\nBoth drink ",{"type":"''","value":["adulteration"]}," or contamination with methyl alcohol (methanol) and drink ",{"type":"''","value":["spiking"]}," in bars and clubs is not uncommon in Bali. Sensible precautions should be taken when buying and consuming beverages. During 2009\/2010 a number of Indonesians and visiting tourists in Java, Bali and Lombok\/Gilli Islands were poisoned by consuming drinks containing methyl alcohol resulting in fatalities. Methyl alcohol or methanol (wood alcohol) and other contaminants are highly dangerous and have been found in some locally produced alcoholic drinks including locally made Arak. The initial symptoms of methyl alcohol\/methanol intoxication include central nervous system depression, headache, hard to see, dizziness, nausea, lack of co-ordination and confusion. If methyl alcohol poisoning is suspected seek medical assistance immediately.\n\nThe HIV infection rate in Bali is increasing, mainly among sex workers of both genders and intravenous drug users.
