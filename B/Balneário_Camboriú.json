The historical story registers that, in 1826, the Portuguese farmer Baltazar Pinto Correa received, from the government of the Province of Santa Catarina, this area to be populated. He had come from the colony of Porto Bello, searching fertile lands. He and his family had fixed residence in the left edge of the River, currently known as neighborhood of Barra, which is still nowadays conserving the Azorian traditions.\nIn 1849 the village got an upgrade, the construction of the Church of Nossa Senhora do Bom Sucesso, made by slaves, in mortar of rude rocks and whale oil. The temple is known by Church of Santo Amaro. The Village, at the same time was the beginning of the cities of Camboriú and Balneário Camboriú, belonging to Itajaí, and to these two cities, before it became a forgotten neighborhood, after some politician pressures that transformed Camboriú, at that time in 1884, known as Vila dos Garcias, into the new headquarters of the town.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nThe nearest airport is Ministro Victor Konder in Navegantes city (NVT) which is about 30 km from Balneario Camboriu.
