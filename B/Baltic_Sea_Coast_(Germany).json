It is especially famous for its long bathing beaches between the island of Usedom and the city of Kiel. The Baltic Sea spas on Rügen and Usedom as well as the city Kühlungsborn have already been very popular in upper-class circles in the 19th century. Evidence of this can in particular be found in the mansions built in the spa style of the turn-of-the-century. Besides beaches and sea spas the region is famous for its different types of coastline (bodden coast; cliff coast) and the diverse nature.
