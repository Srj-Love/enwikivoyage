Those between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sweden"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Finland"]]}," are in Sweden called ",{"type":"''","value":["Finlandsbåt"]}," (\"Finland boat\"), while in Finland ",{"type":"''","value":["Ruotsinlaiva"]}," (\"Sweden boat\").\n\nMost of these ferries carry car traffic between countries. They also function as cruise ships for short shopping trips, from 2 to 48 hours. The 24-hour cruises are wild party cruises, with heavy drinking and crowded dance floors, especially during weekends and holidays. The longer cruises tend to be more laid-back, with a larger portion of travellers who actually intend to visit a foreign country.\n\nIf you have a day or more to spare in a city served by these ferries, consider a cruise. That would give low-cost accommodation, as well as a one-day stop in a new city.\n\nOccasional cruises are special events, such as music festivals or conferences. These might cost extra.\n\nAs of June 2011 the international websites of both Tallink-Silja and Viking Line do at last have on-line booking. Check for \"Red tickets\" or \"Last minute offers\" for cruises reaching Stockholm.\n\nNote that both Viking and Tallink Silja may have a problem with accepting international credit cards. That is not a problem in practice, as you can make a booking and pay it in the port with only a token extra charge (3-5 €).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Tickets"]},"\nIf you intend to use the boats to travel between the cities, it is almost always cheaper to book a round-trip cruise (Sw: ",{"type":"''","value":["kryssning"]},", Fi: ",{"type":"''","value":["risteily"]},"), or even two head-to-head cruises and discard the returns, rather than buy one-way tickets. Tickets can be had for as low as 80 SEK (USD $13, €10) for a full 4-person cabin, making it practically the cheapest accommodation one can find in a high-income country - at 10 SEK\/night\/person for a two-night Stockholm-Helsinki return cruise (provided you book early or last minute during the weekdays), and rarely (even for a weekend cruise in high season) exceeds 400 SEK for the cheapest 4-bed cabin. A one-way ticket, for a shared berth, in comparison, usually exceeds 1000 SEK.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Major companies"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Northern Baltic "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.birka.se\/1\/en-gb\/start\/start.php Birka Cruises"]}]}," offers cruises between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Stockholm"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mariehamn"]]},"(",{"type":"[[","value":[["Åland"]]},"), without the car ferry function."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.tallinksilja.com\/en\/ Tallink\/Silja Line"]}]}," between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sweden"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Finland"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Baltic states"]]}," is a mid-market carrier, offering good standard of food, accommodation and entertainment for road-trips and entertainment cruises.

A regular cabin holds four passengers, holds a standard comparable to two-star hotel room (toilet, shower, soap, towels, reading light), and is much cheaper than a hotel room in Stockholm or Helsinki. Basic cabins have no windows, but cabins and suites of higher standard are also available. If the cruise includes a day stop, you might have access to your cabin throughout the day. Some ferries return immediately and you might have to spend some time ashore before the destination city awakes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nMost cruise ferries have several cafés and restaurants at all price levels (although the budget options will not keep your hunger away), at a standard typical to Sweden and Finland; you know what you get, but you won't be impressed.

These stores, with alcohol and tobacco prices far below Swedish and Finnish levels, are the main attraction for many passengers. Consumption on board is officially not allowed, but happens all the time. At weekend party cruises, these stores do not sell alcohol during evening.\n\nThe stores also offer the classical duty-free supply of perfume, make-up and sweets.

While security guards tend to forgive drunkenness itself, they punish violent passengers by locking them up in a detention cell for the rest of the journey, or even marooning them in a foreign port.\n\nCabin parties are common, but security will respond when guests in the cabin area disturb the neighbours.\n\nAvoid the open deck during night-time and harsh weather. Smoking can be done within designated compartments.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nSaint Petersburg cruises include time in town.\n\nA 40-hour cruise Stockholm–Helsinki, Stockholm–Tallinn, Stockholm-Riga or vice versa includes an 8-hour stop in each city, enough for visitors to make a short tour. \n\nBetween Stockholm and Turku returning with the same ship means 23-hour cruises, without time ashore.\n\nThe pass over Gulf of Finland is short enough to give time in Helsinki or Tallinn, if taking a morning ferry and returning in the evening.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Baltic Sea cruiseferries"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["PartOfTopic"],["Boat travel"],["Scandinavia"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usabletopic"]]}]
