Christianity, Germans and feudalism arrived together in the 13th century. Also in the 13th century, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania emerged as a major political player in Medieval Europe.\n\nIn the 16th century, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth took over control of the area. It lasted until the late 18th century. The area of the Baltic states was then largely absorbed into the Russian Empire, with a slice of modern-day Lithuania being given to Prussia.\n\nAs part of revolutionary Russia's speedy exit from the World War I in 1918, the early Soviet government relinquished claim on the region, creating the states which exist today. Prussia was also considerably reduced after the war.\n\nThe Soviet Union rebounded and re-annexed all three states during World War II in a move greatly resented by their populations. The Nazis used anti-Soviet sentiment to help them form Baltic divisions that assisted the Nazis in wiping out almost all of the area's Jewish population and others considered ethnic or ideological enemies (notably including Poles), though the Nazis' claims to being liberators were not widely believed for long. The Soviets yet again annexed the Baltics in 1944, in a move condemned as illegal in the West but tolerated as part of the emerging Cold War diplomacy. In 1990–91, the Baltic states led the breaking away of the USSR's constituent republics from the central government. They all turned away from Moscow and all joined both the European Union and NATO in 2004. Estonia and Latvia have already joined the Euro, and Lithuania is expected to do so in 2015.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kaliningrad Oblast"],["Kaliningrad"]]},", subject of ethnic cleansing and repopulated by Russians loyal to Moscow, became an exclave of Russia after the fall of the USSR.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Religion"]},"\n\nTraditional Christian affiliations were Lutheranism in much of Latvia and Estonia, and Catholicism in Eastern Latvia and Lithuania. Communism and the general loss of religion across the Western world have eroded the traditional affiliations: in Estonia, 49% say they have no belief in God; in Lithuania, 49% say they do. A smattering of pagan belief persists, for example the Romuva faith, perhaps because this was one of the last areas of Europe to be Christianized.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nEach of the three countries has its own language, with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russian"]]}," as a common second, or even first, language of many, particularly in the cities. English is increasingly spoken, and is largely supplanting Russian as the language of choice among the younger generation. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["German"]]}," is also often understood. Any attempt to speak the native language is greatly appreciated.\n\nThe ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Estonian"]]}," language's similarities with Finnish, along with Finnish cultural influences, allow much mutual comprehension. In Tallinn Finnish is spoken or understood at most places of interest for the average visitor. Some Polish is spoken in Lithuania.\n\nGiven that Russian was the language of the perceived colonial oppressor, it may not be well received. Try first communicating in the native language or in English, at least for greetings and to ask whether the person prefers to speak Russian. The negative attitude towards Russian tends to persist in Estonia and Latvia, with Lithuania having less anti-Russian language sentiment.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Latvian phrasebook"],["Latvian"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lithuanian phrasebook"],["Lithuanian"]]}," are related to each other as Indo-European Baltic languages.
