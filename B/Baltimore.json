Over the course of the battle, British invaders bombed Fort McHenry with rockets as Francis Scott Key wrote what would become the American national anthem. Baltimore was also the site of the first casualty of the American Civil War.\n\nIt also has a large African-American population that has played an important role in its history. African Americans have had a major presence in Baltimore since the Revolutionary War. During that time they were brought to Baltimore as slaves from Africa. Baltimore was also one of the hotbeds during the American Civil Rights movement and famous African-Americans such as Thurgood Marshall and Kweisi Mfume have made Baltimore their hometown.

These factors make the area's climate milder and less extreme than other U.S. cities at this latitude. Summers are humid and hot, but not extremely so, with highs reaching the high 80s to low 90s Fahrenheit and lows in the 60s to low 70s. Winters are cold to mild and moist, with highs in the upper 40s to low 50s, and lows in the 30s and 40s. It is almost never below 10°F in the city proper. Light snow can sometimes fall in winter, although some years there is no significant accumulation and once every few years a coastal storm can dump 8 inches to a foot of snow on the city. Spring and fall bring pleasant temperatures in the 50s-70s(°F), and southern breezes.\n\nWhile weather in the region can vary, Baltimore does not experience the extremes of weather change that occur further north and inland.  Visitors will be able to venture outdoors without a jacket from approximately mid-March to late November.  The hot humid summers invite the wearing of shorts on many days.  The Baltimore area experiences pleasant fall foliage, usually beginning in mid October and ending in early December.  The long warm weather season means that swimming pools are very popular for much of the year as well.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Film"]},"\n\nBaltimore boasts a surprisingly influential, albeit small-scale, film industry.

This accounts for heavy traffic downtown during rush hours and on game days.  Pratt and Lombard streets can be particularly slow due to the confluence of car and pedestrian traffic around the harbor.  If you’re headed east or west across downtown, it’s often quicker to drive a few blocks north to take U.S. Route 40, even if your destination is south of Route 40.\n\nStreets in the central region of the city follow a grid pattern, with alternating one-way streets in many neighborhoods, particularly downtown and on the East Side.  In the outer parts of the city, the street pattern becomes more suburban, centered around radial roads.  Charles Street divides “East” streets from “West,” and Baltimore Street divides “North” from “South” (early city planners clearly had no idea of how far north the city would grow!).  Streets that don’t cross Charles Street or Baltimore Street don’t have a directional label.  Most Baltimore street signs have the block number on them, which helps with navigation.\n\nIt’s not hard to find paid parking garages and lots near all major sights in the city center, usually charging parking rates commensurate with proximity to the Inner Harbor.
