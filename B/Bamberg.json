Before modern kilns became common, most malt was dried over an open flame and most beers features some smokiness. Today, Bamberg is one of very few locations where the old-school smoking takes place. Most rauchbiers are medium-to-full-bodied lagers with pronounced smoke & malt character, light bitterness, and minimal hop flavor. Smoked versions of Weissbier and Bockbier are also available. Around Christmas Schlenkerla also produces a special Bock made with oak-smoked malt; called Eiche (meaning oak) and during Lent produces another special called Fastenbier available only on draught at the Schlenkera tavern. Schlenkerla malts and smokes their own barley, and Bamberg-based malting giant Weyermann produces a comparable version available for export around the world for home and commercial use.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Spezialkeller"],["url=http:\/\/www.spezial-keller.de\/"],["email="],["address=Sternwartstraße 1"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=up the stairs near Concordia, turn left and left again"],["phone = +49 951-54887"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=The open air location to drink Spezial-Beer with typical local food having a panorama view over the city."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Backpackers Bamberg"],["url=http:\/\/www.backpackersbamberg.de\/en\/index.html"],["email="],["address=Heiliggrabstraße 4"],["lat=49.899601"],["long=10.895644"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=DJH Jugendherberge Bamberg-Wolfsschlucht"],["url=http:\/\/www.jugendherberge.de\/jh\/bayern\/bamberg\/index.shtml.de"],["email="],["address=Oberer Leinritt 70"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=across the river (via footbridge) from the tip of Hainpark with car access via Am Rengnitzufer"],["phone=+49 951 56002"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=Paddleboating and swimming opportunities are just a few minutes walk away in the Hain, and restaurants and bars are equally close around the corner in Bug.
