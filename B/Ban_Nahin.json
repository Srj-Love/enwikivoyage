Ban Nahin is a village in a valley surrounded by limestone mountains, and near the most beautiful mountain viewpoint in south Laos. Ban Nahin is a good choice for those who are doing the famous Khammouane motorbike tour known as ",{"type":"''","value":["The Loop"]}," (starting in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tha Khaek"]]},"), and a good choice as well for those who want to visit either the miraculous Konglor cave (50 km from Nahin) or Tad Namsanam waterfall. The latter can be reached by a 3 km jungle hike from Nahin. Ban Nahin has dozens of guesthouses and few restaurants that sell more than Lao traditional food. Ban Nahin is a holiday destination for Lao tourists.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\nBan Nahin sits on Rte 8, and most transport along Rte 8 stops here to pick up and deliver passengers.

The road to Nahin is indicated by prominent signposts for the Konglor Cave. Buses for Lak Xao and semi-regular songthaews (essentially pickup trucks with benches in the back) can be hailed from here as they pass through.
