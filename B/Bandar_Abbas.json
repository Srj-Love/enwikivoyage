The lively bazaar rambles its way across two blocks just back from the seafront, and is probably the most colourful part of town. A seafront promenade leads east and has an evening flea market. At its end, the busy fish market is full of charismatic old salts happy to pose for pictures with their catch. Work on the huge mosque a few metres east of the bazaar seems to have restarted despite local concerns that the engineering is not good enough for a major earthquake zone.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["Cultural Museum of Handicrafts"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Genoo thermal spring"],["url="],["email="],["address=Sirjan Road"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=34 km northeast of Bandar Abbas"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=this spring is situated at a distance of 34 km. northeast of Bandar Abbas and alongside the Bandar Abbas - Sirjan Road.
