Be careful of elk and deer when driving in the town. The most dangerous wildlife in Banff National Park are not bears or cougars, but elk. In spring, female (cow) elk are very protective of their offspring and will charge anyone who they consider a threat. In the fall, male (bull) elk are rutting and very aggressive. Cow elk weigh roughly 230 kg (507 lb), while bull elk weigh about 320 kg (705 lbs). Both sexes are capable of seriously injuring a person, and rutting males have also damaged cars. \n\nThirty years ago, bears used to be quite common within the town but conservation efforts have largely fixed this problem. Garbage and litter within the town must be discarded into bear-proof containers. in Banff National Park It is illegal to feed any wildlife, and both stupid and illegal to feed bears. \"A fed bear is a dead bear\": bears who learn to associate humans with food engage in behaviours that are threatening to humans and ultimately fatal to the bear.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Avalanches"]}," are a risk in winter. This risk is not limited to people engaging in activities like cross-country (Nordic) skiing, skiing off piste, ice climbing, or snowmobiling. The winter of 2013-2014 was particularly tragic in Banff National Park because four people were killed by an avalanche when snowshoeing and two people were killed by an avalanche when sledding. None of them had any avalanche gear with them. \n\nLearn to identify avalanche hazards.  An avalanche slope has enough of a slope to it that you can ski or sled down, but is not so steep that it won't hold snow. If you're not familiar with how to spot avalanche risks, and you want to engage in outdoor activities like snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, or even sledding, check with Parks Canada staff or the Canadian Avalanche Centre website",{"type":"[","value":["www.avalanche.ca"]}," for more information.\n\nBe alert to your surroundings. Not all cliffs or other unsafe areas are marked with signs or blocked off by railings.  Some travellers disregard railings and warning signs of unsafe terrain, when they exist, because they are keen on getting a closer look or taking photographs. Even if the risk is not obvious to you, it's best to assume that someone put up the barriers and safety messages for a good reason.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" If you are staying in the Banff and Lake Louise area and don't mind the slightly longer drive, you may also consider the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Kicking Horse Ski resort"]}," just over the border in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Golden (British Columbia)"],["Golden"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["British Columbia"]]}," located just west of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yoho National Park"]]},", Banff's sister park and Canada's second protected area."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Drive along highway 1A"]}," west of Banff."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Johnston Canyon"]}," hiking."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bow Falls"]}," is located close to the Banff townsite."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Peyto Lake"]]}]}," is located 40 km north of the town on the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Icefields Parkway"]]},"."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Calgary"]]}]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Edmonton"]]}]}]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["placename=Banff"],["image1=TCH 1.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["directionl1=W"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kamloops"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lake Louise"]]}," \/ ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jasper"]]}," (via ",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Alberta Highway 93.svg"],["18px"]]},")"],["directionr1=E"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Calgary"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Canmore"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["guidecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["51.178056"],["-115.571944"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Alberta_Rockies"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Banff, Alberta"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Banff, Alberta"]]}]
