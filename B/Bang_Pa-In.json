Originally built by Ayutthayan King Prasat Thong in 1632 but abandoned after the sack of Ayutthaya in 1767, the site was partially restored by King Mongkut (Rama IV) in the 1850s. The site as it stands today, however, is largely the work of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V). For 17 years from 1872, the grounds were expanded and the more traditional Thai architecture was complemented with buildings in a variety of styles—mainly European but also Chinese. Last restored in 2001, the palace and its immaculate grounds are well worth a visit. The grounds are not too large to be covered on foot, but you can also rent a golf cart to scoot around in for 400 baht for the first hour and 100 baht per hour after that.
