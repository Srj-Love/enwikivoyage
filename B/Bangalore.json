The year 1831 marked a major turning point for the city.

Nevertheless, they are a fast way to get around the city.\n\nAuto-rickshaws are supposed to charge fares as per the meter reading, which most often equals to ",{"type":"{{","value":[["Indian Rupee"]]}," 13 x distance (in kilometres) (Minimum charge of ",{"type":"{{","value":[["Indian Rupee"]]}," 25 for the first 1.8 km or less), they generally tend to charge on an ad-hoc basis depending on the distance of the destination, the chances of getting another customer from the mentioned locality, and their mood. You should simply refuse to board an auto where the meter is faulty or the driver refuses to use it. Saying \"meter please\" will usually do the trick.\n\nTourists should be cautious when approaching an auto-rickshaw during night, or during heavy rains. Chances are they will charge exorbitant rates. Help could be taken from the local traffic police to avail auto-rickshaws during such circumstances. If you are a visitor and do not know the route to the destination it is a good idea to bargain and fix the fare before boarding to avoid long, convoluted routes being used by the driver.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is to be firm but not loud in an argument while travelling in the auto. Some of the less reputable drivers may team up with their friends midway to cause problems. Remember that although Bangaloreans are known for their polite and mild mannered behaviour, auto drivers are normally an exception. Some will think nothing of trying to rip you off. If in doubt, consult a local or your hotel travel desk.\n\nIf a rickshaw driver offers to show\/drive you to some great places to shop, firmly refuse. A common tactic is to drive you to local shops where you will be pressured to buy Indian crafts that you probably don't want. Know your destination and insist upon it. Be firm.\n\nAutos add a 50% surcharge after 22:00 (called \"one and a half\" and is the legal charge). Some drivers may demand 100% surcharge after 22:00 or 23:00 but you must refuse to board in such a case. Heavy luggage costs an additional fee of around ",{"type":"{{","value":[["Indian Rupee"]]},"10-20.\n\nRickshaw drivers are required by law to display their identification on the dashboard or the back of their seats. Refuse to get into a rickshaw that does not display one.\n\nIf an auto driver is problematic, note their identification number and report to the BBMP Control room which is empowered to withdraw their auto license. This is a very effective technique to deal with them. The BBMP control room number as of December 2009 is ☎+91 80 22975803.\n\nThe minimum charge as of February 2014 is ",{"type":"{{","value":[["Indian Rupee"]]},"25 for the first 1.8 km and ",{"type":"{{","value":[["Indian Rupee"]]},"13 for every additional kilometre.\n\nIf you arrive in Bangalore via train, at the main train station there is an office near the taxis\/auto-rickshaws which will print-out a pre-paid receipt for your ride. The service costs ",{"type":"{{","value":[["Indian Rupee"]]},"1, but will save you a potentially large amount of money by giving you an accurate value for your ride. This also allows you to avoid haggling with the driver and acts as an official price agreement in the event that the driver wants to dispute the price of the ride.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nThe taxis in Bengaluru are very convenient and comfortable. Most of the vehicles are Maruti Omni Vans, Tata Indica cars or Mahindra Logan cars, which are much safer than Auto rickshaws, and the drivers are polite. If you are alone or going to an unknown destination, you are strongly advised to choose this option, even though the rates will be double that of an auto. Most taxi companies will charge a flat rate of ",{"type":"{{","value":[["Indian Rupee"]]}," 150 for a pick-up and drop from anywhere to anywhere within city limits. Waiting or return trips will be charged extra, as will a lot of heavy luggage.\n\nUnlike many other countries, taxis are ",{"type":"'''","value":["not"]}," marked with 'TAXI' signs on the top. Instead, the cars will be marked with the logo of the fleet operator or taxi company on the sides of the car. Only some companies like \"Meru Taxi\" are marked with the sign 'Taxi' on them. Some companies have a yellow sign with an identification number (usually an alphabet followed by two digits) on the top. Keep in mind that these taxis cannot be hailed from the street, but have to be called by telephone. When you call, you must give the operator your location, destination as well as phone number, who will in turn tell you the charge (or will inform you that you must go by the meter) as well as the taxi number. The taxi will come pick you up, and call you when they are close. When you go out on the street, look at the license plate for the number they gave you—it will be the last four digits of the license plate. Alternatively, look for the yellow board atop the car with the taxi's identification number.\n\nThe license plate number is usually in the format \"KA\" followed by 01 to 05, followed by two alphabets, followed by a four digit number. Taxis generally have yellow license plates with black letters.\n\nBe prepared to book a taxi a couple of hours in advance if required on weekdays, especially during rush hours, as a huge demand for the taxis, coupled with massive traffic jams during rush hours will ensure that it would be difficult for a taxi to reach you in time. Private taxis are generally more reliable during this time as in many cases, radio cabs (run by Meru, EasyCabs, KSTDC and others) will be overbooked and you might be unfortunate to be informed that your booking has been scrapped.\n\nAlthough it can be hard for non-Indians to grasp at first, the system is actually very effective.

Because of new government regulations, you need a photocopy of your passport (visa and the ID pages), a color photo, and proof of local address (in Bengaluru) when buying a pre-paid card. If you do not have the required paperwork, it is recommended that you ask a local friend to buy a pre-paid card on your behalf. Pre-paid cards are sold in a few of the shops that sell mobile equipment.\n\nPublic telephones are a good option and are available widely. Most shops that offer public phones sport easily visible \"STD\/ISD\/PCO\" signages. More often than not, public pay-phones are post-pay and there will be a person at the shop to take the payments.
