These prices are per person\/per trip. Buy your ticket and then wait until the maximum 20 people needed to fill up a boat show up. More may board and overload the boat. Early in the morning, this rarely takes over an hour. You will be told by the ticket sellers when it's time to go. Normally that information is broadcast over the Public Address system.

Life is made harder by a bunch of guys hanging around the port who will seriously hassle you to buy boat tickets to the Gilis from them.  They use various ruses including claiming that your ticket is no longer valid, that tickets have sold out, or are unavailable.

Do not believe them and do not give in to them as they are normally just trying to play a game of deception. Above all, do not let them lead you to any alternative 'ticket offices' or informal arrangements.  They will claim it is real office.  Many travelers had been tricked to go to a small shack on the right on the way to the Jetty. Instead just head further toward the water and turn left at the end of the approach road where you will see a large sign, the ferry terminal and the real ticket office.  The ticket desk is inside, in the north eastern corner of that building.  It is normally manned by polite and friendly girls.  There are also toilets in there for those who may require them. The \"cowboys\" will be hanging around and about, avoid small talks with them. Also watch out for new 'friends' who will talk about mosquito borne illnesses as part of casual conversation. They may try to guide you toward nearby shops where mosquito repellent and coils are marked up excessively or sell to you directly at absurdly marked up prices. Don't waste your time haggling over the prices as there are fairly priced alternatives at the shops on the islands.  "]},"\nThe way to sidestep this hassle is to book an organized tour with someone like Perama that will take you directly to the Gilis for around Rp 100,000 per person, bypassing Bangsal entirely. Another alternative is to Go to Teluk Nare 4-5 km south of Bangsal and charter a speedboat to your island. Many chose to pre-arrange their transfers with a hotel or dive operator.

Do not automatically expect the boat to have adequate or possibly any safety equipment at all. Ensure you check such equipment for yourself prior to agreeing to the charter. Some traditional perahu boat operators cannot swim so do not expect them to be able to save you should difficulties arise.
