The city population was 625,395 at the 2010 census. Average temperatures vary from 24ºC to 32ºC.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThe official founding date of the city is 24 September 1526, but its history is older than that date. From the time of the ancient kingdom of Nan Serunai, to the Buddhist kingdom of Tanjungpuri and the Hindu kingdom Negara Dipa and its succesor Negara Daha, the rivers of Southern Kalimantan were always been the favorite spot of the Malay people. That’s why Banjarmasin old name was “Bandar Masih”, meaning the port of the Malay in Dayak Bukit dialect. In the chaotic time of civil war between the rightful heir of Negara Daha, Pangeran Samudera, and his uncle, Pangeran Samudera was forced to flee for his life. At this time, Bandar Masih received him warmly, stopped paying taxes to his uncle and support Pangeran Samudera’s fight to get his throne back. When his uncle finally surrendered, Pangeran Samudera decided to make Bandar Masih his new capital, converted to Islam, and begun his rule over the new Islamic Kingdom of Banjar. His day of victory was then celebrated as Banjarmasin’s birthday. The name \"Bandar Masih\" slowly changed into \"Banjarmasin\" as the water tastes salty when in dry season (salty is \"masin\" in Banjarese language). The Kingdom flourished and back in its golden era, its power enveloped almost all of the area of what is now Indonesia’s part of Kalimantan. After the fierce Banjar War which produced a lot of highly-revered local heroes such as Pangeran Antasari, however, it was forced to surrender the colonial Dutch, following the total destruction of the palace ground and the capture of the last Banjarese Princess (Ratu Zaleha). Banjarmasin continued to be the capital of Dutch Borneo throughout the colonial era. Even after the forming of the Indonesian Government, Banjarmasin was the capital of Kalimantan province until it was divided into 4 Provinces (West, East, Central and South), then it became the capital of South Kalimantan. Few is left of its previous glory, but Banjarmasin silently kept her forgotten charm in unexpected places for the persistent travelers to find.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nBanjarmasin’s airport is Syamsuddin Noor (BDJ), half an hour drive from the city. To go to the city, you can take a taxi (with fixed rate) or better yet, tell your hotel to pick you up.\n\nThere are daily flights from many Indonesian cities including Jakarta and Surabaya. The airport is 26km from Banjarmasin.  Or, if you walk about 2 minutes to the street outside of the airport, you should be able to share a mini-van which costs INR10,000 to go to kilometre 6 terminal.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nThe roads of Trans-Kalimantan are in bad condition, but if you’re patient and adventurous you can try to reach Banjarmasin from the neighbouring provinces of Central Kalimantan and East Kalimantan by car.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By ship"]},"\nAnother alternative to get to Banjarmasin is by ship from various places in Indonesia to Banjarmasin’s main harbour, Trisakti. Be forewarned that the condition of passenger ship transportation in Indonesia is poor, albeit cheap, and you might want to consider that before spending the night (at least 1 night if you come from Java). You best bet is Express Ferry where it’s available, only 8 hours from Java, and 2 days + 2 nights of sea trip from Jakarta Tanjung Priuk Harbor Passenger Terminal.  Plus, there are ferries from Semerang and Surabaya, both on Java.  There's a ferry every 2 days between Surabaya and Banjarmasin.\n\nThe ferry between Surabaya and Banjarmasin is 21 hours. If you have a problem with cigarette smoke, this is not a good method of travel. Smoking is permitted in the sleeping area. There are no cabins. Solo females should be aware that they will receive a considerable amount of male attention, most of it unwanted. The food is not good.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\nAlternatively, if you are coming from the neighbouring provinces of East Kalimantan and Central Kalimantan, there are a lot of boat transportations through the rivers of Kalimantan. This could be an adventurous or boring ride depending on your taste. A range of boats are available, from slow moving boats to speedboats. It’s a great choice if you are extremely adaptable with the locals’ way of life.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nYour best bet would be the metered taxi, insist the driver to use the meter if you have to. Alternatively, you can use “angkot” or “bamikro” or public shuttle microbuses, which interesting enough are also called “taxi” too by the locals. Also available is by \"ojek\" (motorcity taxi) and \"becak\" (Tricycle Rickshaw), that cost around USD2.00-2.50 or Rp. 15,000 - 20,000 for inner city trips.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Banjarmasin.jpg"],["thumb"],["Banjarmasin"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Architectural heritage"]},"\nBanjarese, the name of South Kalimantan’s ethnicity, have a unique way of building their houses and other structures in harmony with nature.
