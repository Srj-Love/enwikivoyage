The road to Banteay Chhmar is unpaved, but is currently undergoing improvements.\n\nShared taxis (6 people – 4 in the back; 2 in front plus driver) are USD5 per person. If you need extra legroom, you can ask to pay for 2 seats. A private taxi is USD25.\n\nIn the dry season, it takes approximately 1 hour from Sisophon to Banteay Chhmar. In the rainy season, travel times can be longer depending upon the amount of rain and where it falls. The road is very rarely, if ever, completely closed.\n\nIn the unlikely event that the road is closed, Banteay Chhmar can be reached via Samraong, about 50 km north.
