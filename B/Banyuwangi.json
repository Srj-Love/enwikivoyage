You can however reach G-Land independently with a bus from Sri Tanjung terminal to Benculuk (about 1 hour), where you change and catch another bus to Grajagan (about 30 minutes).\n\nYou can hire private jeeps with a driver in Banyuwangi.

It is also an area of great mystical significance to the Javanese - local legend has it that this was the first area of the whole world to emerge from the ocean. \n\nThe park is largely flat with highest peak only 320 m and covers some 43,000 hectares. There are some beautiful, deserted beaches here as well as large swatches of lowland tropical forest. The world famous G-land surf camp is on the park borders. \n\nThe key access point to the park is the village of Triangulasi which is about 80 km south east of Banyuwangi. Before visiting you should make contact with the national park office in Banyuwangi at ",{"type":"''","value":["Alas Purwo National Park Head Office"]},", Jl A Yani 108, ☎ +62 333 428675. There is some very basic self-catering hut accommodation at Triangulasi, as well as a camping ground and the park office will be able to advise you on this. \n\nMammals to be seen inside the park include banteng (the buffalo of Java), asiatic wild dog, leopard cat, muntjac deer and ebony leaf monkey. The park's western beaches are noted turtle hatching areas with olive ridley, hawksbill, green and leatherback turtles all occurring.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Ijen volcano.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["The Ijen Crater in East Java"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["The Ijen Plateau"]},"\n\nNear Banyuwangi and Bondowoso, this is a spectacular area of volcanic activity. The Ijen Plateau is the centrepoint of the large mountain range west of Banyuwangi, and which abutts the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Baluran National Park"]]}," to the north. \n\nThe Ijen Crater (",{"type":"''","value":["Kawah Ijen"]},") can be approached from Bondowoso in the west or Banyuwangi in the east. The Bondowoso route is recommended as the road is relatively better (although that is not saying much) and the 90 minute foot climb much easier. From Bondowoso you are best off finding a guide with a car (preferably a 4x4) who will drive you through the village of Wonosari and eastwards up a very basic potholled road which winds its way up the mountain.  You will pass through native casuarina forest and extensive coffee plantations before the road ends at the village of Jampit where there is some shelter available (",{"type":"''","value":["Pos Paltuding"]},"). If you are travelling late in the day, you could actually bed down with a sleeping bag or camp here as you could in the disused vulcanology station huts slightly further up the mountain. The crater lake is a 90 minute hike further on from here. When you arrive the colour of the water in the lake is scarcely believable being an extraordinary vivid aqua blue. Evidence of volcanic activity is everywhere with steaming water and brilliant yellow crystaline sulphur deposits. Collecting the latter is an industry here and one with extremely harsh working conditions. You will see many workers trudging up and down the mountain carrying sacks of sulphur. \n\nTo the crater there are two roads: one from Banyuwangi and the other from Bondowoso. Both come together at the parking, from where you can go up to the crater. Neither road is good, but the Bondowoso route is easier. \n\nMany other post-caldera cones and craters are located within the caldera or along its rim. The largest concentration of post-caldera cones forms an E-W-trending zone across the southern side of the caldera. Coffee plantations cover much of the Ijen caldera floor, and tourists are drawn to its waterfalls, hot springs, and dramatic volcanic scenery. The Ijen Crater is certainly one of the great natural wonders of Indonesia.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Gandrung Dance."]}," This is a highly regarded art-form in Banyuwangi and one of the nicknames for the city is actually Gandrung.
