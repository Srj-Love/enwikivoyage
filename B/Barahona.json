[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Caribbean default banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Barahona"]}," is a province of the Dominican Republic.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Regions"]},"\nBarahona is a remote region of the Dominican Republic.  It is sparsely populated and wildly beautiful.  Very few travelers venture here, but the adventure of it all makes it rewarding.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\nBarahona is an attractive, adequate provincial city, the only one of any size in the Southwest region. It has little to offer besides a good beach, an interesting cathedral, and a good bar scene. It is the base for visiting the isolated, prehistoric-looking Lago de Enriquillo, as well as a visit to the ramshackle, 'duty free' border market in nearby Malpasse, Haiti.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\nLago de Enriquillo is an astounding natural wonder, located far below sea level among striking, stony mountains.  Enriquillo was a Taino chief, and a forlorn statue of this great 'cacique' stands along the long, deserted dirt road to the lake.  A boat trip will reveal weird and wonderful plants and animals, the most amazing of which are the many 5-foot crocodiles, said to be harmless, but don't go wading.  This end-of-the-world place is very much worth the day trip from Barahona (ask at your hotel), the price of which includes sandwiches, beer, and a visit to the ramshackle border market in nearby Malpasse, Haiti.  Top-drawer Barbancourt Rum, Cuban cigars, and surprisingly good Comme Il Faut cigarettes are available at low prices, and you'll meet real Haitians who happen to speak 'market' Dominican Spanish.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThis is a largely impoverished area, but people are mostly honest, dignified, and happy you've made such an effort to visit.  Prices are low. Food is bland, but Barahona has a good, safe bar scene (signs warn customers to check their arms at the door).  Motorcyclists will take you anywhere in town for 10 pesos.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nSpanish only.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nSafe, scenic, cheap daily bus service (3 hours) from Santo Domingo.  Ask for \"Barahona\" lot.  Some stops at clean service areas along the way, with good meals.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Itineraries"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nVisit the town beach. It's not Ipanema, but it's relaxing with spectacular views.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nYou didn't come to remote Barahona for the cuisine, did you?  Satisfactory (at best) cafe and hotel food is available.  But you won't go hungry, or get sick, either.  Preparing meals from market-bought food is probably your best bet.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nGood, cheap bars in the town center.  People-watching is the main entertainment.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nNo real problems in this quiet, rather dull city.  Danger exists in the wild countryside due to isolation, and by Lago de Enriquillo, the crocodiles.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Dominican Republic"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["18.2"],["-71.1"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Barahona Province"]]}]
