The first wave were of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Saladoid-Barrancoid"]}," group, farmers, fishermen, and ceramists who arrived by canoe from Venezuela's Orinoco Valley around 350 AD. The ",{"type":"'''","value":["Arawak"]}," people were the second wave, arriving from South America around 800 AD. Arawak settlements on the island include Stroud Point, Chandler Bay, Saint Luke's Gully, and Mapp's Cave. According to accounts by descendants of the aboriginal Arawak tribes on other local islands, the original name for Barbados was Ichirouganaim. In the 13th century, the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Caribs"]}," arrived from South America in the third wave, displacing both the Arawak and the Salodoid-Barrancoid. For the next few centuries, they lived in isolation on the island.\n\nThe name \"Barbados\" comes from a Portuguese explorer named Pedro Campos in 1536, who originally called the island Los Barbados (\"The Bearded Ones\"), after the appearance of the island's fig trees, whose long hanging aerial roots resembled beards. Between Campos's sighting in 1536 and 1550, Spanish conquistadors seized many Caribs on Barbados and used them as slave labor on plantations. The others fled the island, moving elsewhere.\n\nBarbados was formally settled by the ",{"type":"'''","value":["British"]}," in 1627. After several failed crops of cotton, sugarcane was introduced, and the colony established itself as a profitable plantation economy. Enslaved ",{"type":"'''","value":["Africans"]}," were the primary source of labour on these plantations until 1834, when they won their freedom through several years of rebellion, supported by increasing pressure from anti-slavery movements in Britain.\n\nThe economy remained heavily dependent on sugar, rum and molasses production through most of the 20th century. Though the shackles were removed, much of the repressive labour conditions of slavery remained on the island until the 1930s, when the educated black middle class fought for universal adult suffrage and took the control of the country's local governance away from the British-descended local aristocracy. The country began a process of social and political reforms in the 1940s and 1950s which led to complete independence from the United Kingdom in 1966. In the 1980s, tourism and manufacturing surpassed the sugar industry in economic importance. Barbados has developed into a stable democracy with one of the highest rates of literacy in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nLocals refer to themselves as ",{"type":"''","value":["Bajans"]}," and things Barbadian as ",{"type":"''","value":["Bajan"]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Regions"]},"\nThe island of Barbados has eleven parishes which can be sensibly divided into four regions:\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Regionlist"],["regionmap=Barbados region map.png"],["regionmapsize=420px"],["region1name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bridgetown"]]}],["region1color=#d5dc76"],["region1description=the eponymous capital city of Barbados and surrounding areas in Saint Michael Parish."],["region2name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Central Eastern Barbados"]]}],["region2color=#71b37b"],["region2description=the parishes of Saint Andrew, Saint George, Saint John, Saint Joseph and Saint Thomas.

Note that stiff penalties prohibit the dropping of anchors on coral reefs.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nDriving is on the left. The bus system is extensive, cheap and fast if you are headed to somewhere on the main route, but a car (or mini-moke) is the only way to see many of the out-of-the-way sights. Many drivers will hold a bus for you if they see you are from out of town, reflecting the typical welcoming spirit. Buses are run by the Barbados Transport Board (blue) and are quiet. Private operators include the yellow buses, which play very loud music, and private mini-vans (white), which are usually cramped and crowded. The two privately run means of transport are often driven very fast and recklessly. All charge the same fare (BD$2.00). Yellow buses and minivans offer change and even accept US dollars. BTB buses accept Barbados dollars and do not give change.\n\nThere are also more than enough taxis to take you wherever you need to go on the island for reasonable prices. They do not use meters and it is best to negotiate the price before you get in. However, most taxi drivers are honest and you are unlikely to be overcharged. Be sure to ask the management of the hotel or the friendly locals what the going rate is for a cab ride to your destination.\n\nRenting a car is expensive. If you are driving, be aware that the roads on the island are generally quite narrow, with the exception of the ABC highway, which also has several long sections towards the west coast that is under large scale construction to expand the road to accommodate additional lanes.  It is advisable to be extra cautious as many roads on the island have sharp turns, steep inclines, and are generally quite bumpy, although most are paved.\n\nMany of these \"highways\" do not have sidewalks, so there can be pedestrians on the street sharing the road. Many bus stops are also on the side of roads where there are no sidewalks. Additionally, beware of impromptu passing lanes as slow drivers are often passed by others behind them when on two lane roads. Road signs can be fairly confusing, so be prepared to get lost: just keep your petrol tank topped up and keep asking the way as people are always eager to help.\n\nAt most all of the local car rental agencies, a full collision damage waiver policy is automatically included with the rental, except for any damage incurred to the car tires, a testament to the poor condition of the smaller roads and tendency of foreign drivers to miscalculate driving lanes and hit curbs.\n\nMopeds and bikes can also be rented to explore sites not easily reached by cars. This not recommended however due to the poor condition of many of the secondary and residential roads. Except for the main highway, all the other roads provide a hazardous journey to the moped or bike rider due to no sidewalks, frequent pot holes, sharp corners and speeding local buses.\n\nAnother fun way to get around is to rent a moke available from any number of local car rental agencies.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nThe official language in Barbados is English. Bajan (occasionally called Barbadian Creole or Barbadian Dialect), is an Irish\/English-based creole language spoken by locals. Bajan uses a mixture of West African idioms and expressions, such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Igbo phrasebook"],["Igbo"]]},", along with British English & Irish to produce a unique Barbadian\/West Indian vocabulary and speech pattern. There are a few African words interspersed with the dialect. Communication will not be a problem for any English speaker, and Barbados has one of the highest literacy rates in the Western Hemisphere.There was a large number of Irish prisoners of war sent to the island as indentured servants after the English Civil War ( Oliver Cromwel).

Keep in mind that exchangers in hotels may insist on taking an additional percentage of the exchange (typically 5%).\n\nMany \"duty free\" shops cater to visitors: from cruise ships.

It is wise for tourists to avoid certain high-risk activities like walking on secluded beaches, day or night, and walking in unfamiliar residential neighborhoods or secluded areas away from main roads. Tourists, particularly women, should always stay in groups.\n\nThe most common kinds of crimes against tourists include taxi fraud, robbery, and shortchanging; however, rape and assaults are becoming more common. Most Bajans are by nature friendly, especially in the earlier part of the tourist season (November and December).\n\nA special area of concern for visitors to Barbados is drugs. The country's strict antidrug policy is made apparent to visitors coming through Customs. In practice, however, Europeans and Americans in Barbados are offered marijuana or even cocaine frequently. Sellers will often roam the beaches selling aloe vera or other such innocuous goods as a pretense to begin a conversation about \"ganja,\" \"smoke\" or \"bad habits.\" As a result, many hotels and resorts now ban the use of aloe vera under the pretense that it \"stains the towels.\"\n\nRegardless of one's inclination to use drugs, it is not advisable to accept these offers. Marijuana is considered bad and is not accepted by Bajan police. While Bajan police are not frequently encountered, they prosecute drug crimes easily.\n\nCare should also be taken going into the sea. Many people underestimate just how powerful the currents can be and rip tides have claimed lives over the years. Always look out for warning flags.Also a good rule of thumb is to bathe where you see people that is a good indicator of the safety. Do not go out deep (beyond your ability to touch the sea bed) unless you are a strong swimmer.The west coast has calmer waters than the south coast of christ church which gets progressively rougher as you go east of oistins.\n\nHomosexual acts between consenting adults are punishable by life imprisonment in Barbados.\n\nCamouflage clothing is forbidden for non-military personnel in Barbados.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\n\nBeware of the sun, Barbados is only 13 degrees off of the equator and you can get sun burnt very easily. It is very important to keep your water intake high. Drink plenty of water or bring an umbrella to shade yourself against the sun, which is commonly done in the country.\n\nDuring nightfall, it is advisable to put on bug spray, as mosquitoes are often a nuisance to anyone staying outdoors for prolonged periods. This is most prevalent while eating at outdoor restaurants.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Respect"]},"\n\nDespite, or maybe because of, the tropical climate, Bajans tend to dress conservatively when not on the beach. A bikini will not be appreciated in town and certainly not in church.\n\nBajans are particularly sensitive to manners and saying, \"Good morning\" to people, even strangers, goes a long way to earning their respect.\n\nWhen meeting a Bajan, try not to discuss politics or racial issuses. Talk is also important because Barbadians speak fairly fast when speaking in Creole (or Bajan, as it is called).\n\nThe use of the \"N\" word is a ",{"type":"'''","value":["no"]},", but when talking to friends words such a \"B\" (which is short for \"bro\") and \"dawg\" are used to describe or refer to a friend. Initially these words should not be used unless you know the person well.\n\nMost Bajans are fun-loving and love to go out and have fun, as is noted by the large number of young people found in the clubs and on the Southern Coast of the island. Try not to stare at persons without good cause. If you happen to bounce into someone in a club, you should immediately apologise to the person.\n\nKeep in mind that Bajans are very protective of family, and insults to a person's family are taken very seriously, this also relates to their views on issues such as homosexuality; even though most Bajans do not agree with the practice, your rights are still respected.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\nThere are several small internet cafes located around the island as well as connections offered by the larger resort hotels.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecountry"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Caribbean"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Geo"],["13.166667"],["-59.55"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Barbados"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Caribbean\/Barbados\/"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Barbados"]]}]
