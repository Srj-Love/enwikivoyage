Ask around locally & in the guesthouses.  Mr.B would be a great help here and almost anybody in the village would be able to help out and recommend something or somebody.

Grab a plate of chaana, a chia and watch the village ramble by. \n\nHeading down the road towards the National Park entrance on the right(about 200metres from the shops above) next to the pharmacy and little book shop is another excellent tea shop. Tea, samosas, doughnuts et al also here. Absolutely essential is the purchase of a bowl of 'chola'. Look for the outside stove.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nLocal alcohol.
