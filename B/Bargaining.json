You are a visiting amateur going up against a professional on his or her home turf. Just holding your own and getting a reasonable price will be an accomplishment; do not expect to achieve some miraculously low price. Against a pro boxer, almost anyone would be justifiably proud just to leave the ring on their feet; hoping to win the bout would be foolish and hoping to score a knockout utterly ludicrous.\n\nAlso consider your priorities. If you are bargaining over some silk item that would cost $200 back home, it may not be worth worrying about whether you pay $20 or $25 in Thailand. If you make good money and are spending a substantial chunk of it on a trip, then it makes no sense to waste a half an hour to save $5; your time is worth more than that and you have plenty of better things to do with it during a trip.\n\nSometimes the amounts you are arguing over are just a pittance to a traveller from a relatively rich country, but are quite important to someone in a poorer country who needs to make a living off the tourist trade. An amount that is large to you may be huge to the vendor. In some cases, for example, a big sale might mean the difference between ",{"type":"''","value":["all"]}," the vendor's children going to school this year or just the boys.\n\nIf possible, try to buy in areas where there are many vendors and competition may bring prices down.

Even getting \"cheated\" by a merchant in a local bazaar, perhaps paying $25 for something a local could buy for $10, is often better than buying it in some overpriced airport shop.

If he thinks you are rich, the price may go up. To get a better price, tell him you are a backpacker on a tiny budget, a student, an English teacher on a low local salary, or whatever. You cannot really afford what he is selling, but you like it a lot; can he do something to make it possible? When doing this, ",{"type":"'''","value":["try not to look rich"]},"; a Rolex on your wrist and $2000 worth of camera around your neck will definitely not help.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Be strong"]},". Don't let them get to you, no matter how hard they push. You might be offered tea, coffee, snacks, etc. You can accept them and it does not mean you have to buy anything, although you may be 'guilt-tripped' later. You have only one obligation; to buy once a price is agreed.

You will most certainly get at least two offers, each lower than the previous. Alternatively, the vendor may ask \"How much do you want this?\" (or words to that effect), which acknowledges the fact that they realise a potential sale is walking out of the door. In some cultures it is also common for the salesman to walk off if the price is too low.

Alas, in general this doesn't work: many shopkeepers are perfectly aware of this tactic and will thus first offer an absolutely ridiculous price that can be tens or hundreds of times more than the real value, which they will then be more than willing to negotiate down to \"half\".\n\nIf you feel that you ",{"type":"''","value":["must"]}," have a general rule to go by in those situations, remember that in tourist areas it is quite common for a moderately skilled bargainer to pay below a quarter of the initial asking price, and an eighth is not unheard of. You should start below what you hope to pay, so your first offer should be around a tenth of the asking price. If you really want to just get the bargaining over with, and do not mind paying over the odds to accomplish that, you could go as high as a fifth.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" More advanced methods "]},"\nSome bargaining techniques take more effort or planning, or just more nerve or more practice:\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:China_porcelain.jpg"],["thumb"],["Porcelain in a Shanghai market"]]},"\nThe more you ",{"type":"'''","value":["know about the merchandise"]},", the better.
