Many wineries in the region are open for tastings, with many also serving food and beer.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nThe evidence of the original German settlers can be seen in the steeply sloping roofs of the older buildings. The local cuisine is very heavily influenced by Germanic culture. For example, meats such as Mettwurst, Bratwurst and a range of other tasty and old-fashioned sausages are found throughout the region. On the dessert side, heavy cream cakes are very popular, including Bienenstich and cream buns of all sorts of forms.\n\nThere is also an Anglo influence in the Scottish Angaston region. You will be able to see the differences between this town and the surrounding Germanic towns, in the architecture and even by the family names that can be found on war memorials etc.\n\nReligion in this region is predominantly Lutheran, so expect to see many churches made from stone, with beautiful silver spires reaching to the sky. The quality architecture is testament to much loving care and fine masonry skills lavished on the building of the churches in the past 150 years.\n\nIt is now possible to say with truth and pride that the Barossa is one of the finest wine producing regions in the world.  It has great soils, family farms where the wine-growing traditions have been passed down through the generations and local oenologist courses at such places as Roseworthy College are ensuring that winemakers are highly educated and skilled in their winemaking.  Many of the local schools also include winemaking courses as part of their agricultural studies curricula.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nThe Northern Expressway provides direct access to the Barossa from Adelaide.  It is a 110 km\/hr, limited access freeway.  From Adelaide take the Port Wakefield Highway (A1) to the north,  then onto the M20 motorway, bypassing the town of Gawler and entering the Barossa at Greenock in the Northwest of the valley.   Allowing 60â€“75 minutes between the airport and Barossa winery tasting rooms is realistic.\n\nGetting to the Barossa from Adelaide or the airport is considerably easier than traveling to Australia's other major wine regions (Hunter Valley from Sydney - about 2-1\/2 hours; Yarra Valley from Melbourne - about 1-1\/2 hours; or Margaret River from Perth - about 3-1\/2 hours).\n\nThe scenic driving route to the Barossa is via the Adelaide Hills just East of the city, and then North through the hills enjoying country roads and sleepy towns.  Perhaps drive through Inglewood Houghton and Williamstown to arrive in the Valley at Lyndoch. If time permits, the whispering wall, a reservoir wall at Williamstown is worth a visit. Similar to the sound effect in the dome of St Pauls London, but on a far far larger scale, whispered sounds, inaudible a few feet away are miraculously focussed by the wall to be perfectly audible half a kilometre or so away.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nLink SA ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.linksa.com.au"]}," run coach transfers Gawler and the Barossa four times daily, with two services extending to Adelaide.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nPublic transport isn't that good within the valley, which is a shame given the opportunities to drink excellent wine, usually for free.  Hotels can arrange transfers to and from the airport if that's what you want.
