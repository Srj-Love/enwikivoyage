Barranca has just made a major investment in cleaning up the beach community and it is now arguably the nicest swimming beach on the north coast.   It is all soft sand and a full range of waves perfect for gentle swimming, body surfing or good Hawaiian board surfing.  If you are an early riser, you will see the fishermen bring in the daily catch.  Down at the far end of the beach where the fishermen have their boats, the Malabu Bar is one of the great 3rd world bars with eclectic music and the best imaginable views of the ocean and sunsets.  It is definitely worth spending a night at one of the beach hotels.  The mototaxis (three-wheelers) are cheap, but not the safest or most comfortable mode of transportation.  Regular cabs are also available and a safer bet.  \n\nSit down and catch a breeze at the Plaza de Armas (People's Square)and meet the locals and maybe enjoy a street comedy improv.  \n\nThe Barranca market (not the Mercado Antiquo, but the Central Market) is one of the very best on the coast.

It is a typical indoor market with zones for fish, meat, poultry, vegetables, fruit, dry goods, etc.  Don't look for a lot of Peruvian artesania, it's not there.
