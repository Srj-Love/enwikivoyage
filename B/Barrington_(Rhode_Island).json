Due to its coastal New England climate, Barrington experiences all four seasons, with a long summer, blooming spring, scenic autumn, and snowy winter.  In the summer, it offers quick getaways to the beaches in Newport, the Cape, and the Islands, and in the winter, ski trips to New Hampshire, Maine, and Vermont are just a few hours north.  Barrington offers the best parts of New England living, while offering a quiet haven with easy access to the nearby action.\n\n“Bordered on three sides by water, this small town on Narragansett Bay retains the leisurely feel of its days as an early 20th-century summer resort.
