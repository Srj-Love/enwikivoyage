In the town centre there is a Weatherspoons and a Yates, as well as other local pubs that serve good quality pub food. You can also find excellent Chinese restaurants, some of a buffet style, where you pay a set fee, usually £5 to £8 to eat all you like. Night life is Barrow is centred around Cornwallis street (ajacent to the town hall) where most of the music pubs and night clubs are situated, most, but not all, charge an entrance fee to a maximum of £5 and the main night club (Club M) at the end of the street is open till 5AM. All other clubs on the street are open till 3AM. It can get very lively in the early hours of the morning at weekends when locals and out-of-town contractors ( usually Scottish) mix, although fighting does happen it a lot rarer than it once was, the street no longer justifies its name \"the Gaza strip\" which locals still use to identify the street. It is now more than likely that you will have a trouble free night, provided you don't cause it yourself!!\nOn the whole it's possible to have a good night on a relatively small budget, and meet people from all over the UK and the Canadian navy who are working in the towns world renowed shipyard, you will find the locals on the whole friendly and warm and will easily talk to strangers (unlike in London and the South East ) especially after a few drinks!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nHigh End Accommodation - N\/A\n\nMid-range Accommodation - Abbey House Hotel, Duke of Edinburgh Hotel\n\nBudget Accommodation - Travelodge\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Cumbria"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Barrow-in-Furness"]]},{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["54.116666666667"],["-3.2166666666667"]]}]
