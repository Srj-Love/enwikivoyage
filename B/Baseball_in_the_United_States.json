Baseball is played at a number of amateur levels, from Little League to High School to College, and professional leagues range from the lowest Minor Leagues to Major League Baseball. In almost any place in America, there will be a baseball game going on during the spring and summer months, and it is a fantastic way to meet the locals and experience American sports culture.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nBaseball's origins are murky at best, and there is a lot of mythology behind it.  But the game does bear similarities to ",{"type":"'''","value":["cricket"]},", which, like baseball, appears to have evolved from earlier batted-ball games popular in England and Western Europe.  For decades, the invention of the game was attributed to ",{"type":"'''","value":["Abner Doubleday"]},", with the first game occurring in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cooperstown (New York)"],["Cooperstown"]]},", New York, but historians now agree that neither had anything do with the game's origins.\n\nThe game is played between two teams, each with nine players active at a time.  The teams take turns playing defense and offense, with the same players playing both roles.  While on offense, players come to ",{"type":"'''","value":["home plate"]}," in order and try to hit a thrown baseball with a wooden or aluminum bat, with the objective of sending it far enough away that the batter can reach ",{"type":"'''","value":["base"]}," before the ball can be relayed there.  On defense, each of the nine players has a set position on the field: one ",{"type":"'''","value":["pitcher"]},", who throws the ball to the batter; one ",{"type":"'''","value":["catcher"]},", who catches any pitched balls that do not get hit; one player at each of the three bases; a ",{"type":"'''","value":["shortstop"]}," between second base and third base; and three ",{"type":"'''","value":["outfielders"]}," who roam the large expanse between the bases and the far edge of the playing field, trying to catch batted balls and relay them inward.\n\nA batter has three chances, or ",{"type":"'''","value":["strikes"]},", to hit a ball into play; if he or she misses three times, he or she is ",{"type":"'''","value":["out"]},".  The batter is also out if the batted ball is caught before hitting the ground, or if the ball is relayed to the base before the batter can reach it.  The pitcher must give the batter a reasonable chance to hit the ball; if the ball is thrown outside of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["strike zone"]},", the pitcher is charged with a ",{"type":"'''","value":["ball"]},".  Four balls to the same batter allows the batter to advance to first base automatically, called a ",{"type":"'''","value":["walk"]},".\n\nOnce a batter reaches base, he or she becomes a ",{"type":"'''","value":["runner"]},", and can attempt to advance to additional bases if the ball is still far enough away.  Wherever the runner stops, he or she waits there as the next batter comes up.  The runner can try to advance to the next base at any time, but can be called ",{"type":"'''","value":["out"]}," if the defense can get the ball to the target base before the runner.  Normally, this occurs when the batter puts the ball into play, but if the runner advances on a pitch that wasn't batted into play, it's called a ",{"type":"'''","value":["steal"]},".\n\nA ball hit out of play to the left of third base or the right of first base is ",{"type":"'''","value":["foul"]}," and counts as a strike (but cannot cause an out unless it's caught on the fly).  If the batter hits the ball beyond the outfield wall (though within the foul lines), it's a ",{"type":"'''","value":["home run"]},"; the batter and all runners automatically advance to home plate and score.  A home run, or \"homer\", is always sure to get the fans on their feet; it's the game's signature play.\n\nIf a runner advances from third base and reaches home plate safely, a run is scored.  A team can score unlimited runs during its turn at bat, but only so long as three outs have not been recorded.  Once the third out is made, no more runs can be scored, and the teams switch sides.  A full pair of these turns is called an ",{"type":"'''","value":["inning"]},", and the game lasts for nine innings (less at the amateur levels) unless the score is tied at the end.  In the event of a tie, full innings are played until an inning ends with one team ahead.\n\nBeyond these basics, there are many quirks and special cases in the baseball rules, some of which baffle even die-hard fans to this day.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Major League Baseball"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/MLB.com Major League Baseball"]}]}," is the highest level of baseball played in the U.S. and the richest professional baseball league in the world. It attracts the highest level of talent from North America, South America, Asia, and the Caribbean. There are thirty major-league teams in twenty-six U.S. cities (plus one in Canada). Each team plays in its own stadium, all of which seat at least 35,000 spectators. \n\nTickets generally cost between $15-50 for most seats; the best seats will cost upwards of that. The New York Yankees, Boston Red Sox, Philadelphia Phillies and Chicago Cubs are the most difficult teams to get tickets for, but online seller-to-seller websites have available tickets if you're willing to pay more. Major League Baseball season runs from early April-late September, with pre-season Spring Training games in March and the post-season playoffs in October. Games during the season are organized into series, referred to by the home team as \"homestands\", of 3-4 games in a row between the same two teams in the same city.\n\nWith the recent wave of new ballpark construction, many stadiums have been built in lively neighborhoods with lots of bars and restaurants catering to fans. However, there's also stadiums that sit isolated in a sea of parking lots. Many ballparks, particularly the newer or the more famous ones, are open for tours on off-game days; see the individual city articles for further details.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Teams"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Fenway from Legend's Box.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Fenway Park - Home of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boston"]]}," Red Sox"]]},"\nMajor League Baseball is divided into two leagues: the ",{"type":"'''","value":["American League"]}," and the ",{"type":"'''","value":["National League"]},", each of which is further divided into three divisions: East, Central, and West.\n\nThe two leagues are also distinguished in that the American League uses the ",{"type":"'''","value":["designated hitter rule"]}," where the pitcher does not hit and run bases with another player, the designated hitter, substituting; the National League does not use this rule.\n\nHere is a run-down of all the teams:\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["American League East"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Baltimore Orioles - Oriole Park at Camden Yards"]}," - ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Baltimore"]]},", Maryland (in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Baltimore\/South Baltimore"],["South Baltimore"]]},").
