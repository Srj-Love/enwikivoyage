The Neolithic period (4.500 to 2.500 BC) brought about a major change in people`s lifestyle: the inhabitants built settlements and began to farm the land and raise livestock.

In ancient times, today´s Euskal Herria and adjacent areas were inhabited by ancestors of Basques who the Greek historian Strabon considered savages and warriors.\n\nThe land of Vascones became a kingdom in the ninth century when the nobles chose Iñigo (824-852) from the Aritza dynasty as king.\nThe kingdom underwent many changes over the next few centuries under Castilian King Ferninand the Catholic invaded and subdued by arms peninsular Navarre Kingdom in 1512.\n\nFrom the 12th to the 15th centuries villas(towns) and cities emerged, also with their own local fueros or charters and rigths granted by kings. It was during this period tha the so-called \"foral territories\" were created and agreements reached with the king, by which he would have authority over the land in exchange for respecting the territorial self-governments or fueros and rigths.\n\nThe 19th century is characterised by a gradual loss of rigths for the Basque people. The Kingdom of Navarre was incorporated as another province in Spain and the other three provinces of the south refused to become a single province, and therfore retained provisional status.\n\nIn the late 19th century new ideologies and political movements came into existence, such as socialism but especially Basque nationalism for the restoration of the rights and privileges of the Basque people, as did labour unions.\n\nThe first 3 decades of the 20th century came a flurry of political activity, followed by the military uprising led by Franco and a long civil war (1936-1939). In 1936 the Spanish Congress (Cortes españolas) passed the Basque Statute of Autonomy and Euskadi reestablished its self-government that had been demanding since the abolition of the rights and fueros. The entire Basque Country fell to Franco´s troops in July of 1937. \n\nThe Franco dictatorship (1939 to 1975) was a dark chapter.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Geography "]},"\nThe area is divided into three different legal and political entities:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The Autonomous Community of Euskadi comprises the territories or provinces of Araba, Bizkaia and Gipuzkoa.

The southern and northern Basque Country are divided into two states: Spain and France.\n\nEuskal Herria is therefore the combination of seven historical territories divided into these three administrative regions.\n\nAlthough today the term Euskal Herria defines a historical and cultural entity rather than a unified political or administrative region, it does share a significant amount of common heritage, culture, language, history and identity.\n\nOften the term Basque Country is used to refer only to the Autonomous Community of Euskadi, but this is incorrect.

Practically everyone will speak fluent Spanish or French, while Basque is less widely spoken. 700,000 out of the Basque country's population of 2,100,000 speak Basque. From the region's location, you might expect this language to be a blend of Spanish and French, but Basque is unrelated to either of them or any other language in the world because it was developed in isolation from neighboring peoples.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Bilbao"]]},"-Bilbo: Loiu airport ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.aena.es\/csee\/Satellite?cid=1047658432525&pagename=subHome&Language=EN_GB&SiteName=BIO&c=Page"]}," is the largest in Basque Country, with a stunning terminal building designed by Santiago Calatrava.

It is an ideal place for wineries to multiply, spread, consolidate and, in the process, amass large quantities of money for their owners. As these fortunes grow, new brands need to be created and fresh images must be marketed. One way some wineries achieve this is by using avant-garde architecture for the construction of their buildings.\n\nIn the little town of Elciego, the Marques de Riscal winery has one of these futuristic buildings designed by world-famous architect Frank Gehry (he also designed the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, a hundred miles or so to the north). This time, however, he \"pushed the envelope\" (so to speak) of the Guggenheim style. He made the Guggenheim convoluted shapes flow more freely as if a storm were blowing on the outer surfaces and making them flap like flags in the wind. The result is absolutely astonishing.  The sole purpose for the edifice is to be a temple to Bacchus, the god of wine! \n\nA few miles away, just outside Laguardia, another famous architect by the name of Santiago Calatrava recently created the Isios winery. (He also designed the new Olympic stadium in Athens, Greece, and the ultra-modern City of Arts and Sciences\/Performing Arts Center, in Valencia, Spain) Although not as much \"out-on-the-edge\" as the Marques de Riscal winery, its soaring, wavy roof set against the backdrop of the blue sky and the green mountain range is a sight to see.\n\nThe industrialist Solomon R. Guggenheim was inspired by Baroness Hilla Rebay von Ehrenwiesen’s love for modern art. Rebay laid more emphasis on art that is non-objective. Guggenheim is known for his debates on abstract art with Robert Delaunay, Albert Gleizes, and Wassily Kandinsky. Kandinsky’s Composition 8 was purchased by Guggenheim, which made the entire collection famous\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Come in mid-August for Bilbao's annual week-long festival."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Sun, sea, sand and surf at numerous beaches along the coast from France towards Bilbao."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Pintxos"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Txakoli"]},": white wine from the regions of Bizkaia and Gipuzkoa, also now produced in a part of Araba\/Alava.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Rioja wines"]},": produced in La Rioja, south of Araba\/Alava and southwest of Nafarroa\/Navarra.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Cider"]}," (Sagardoa in basque): is not like British or Nordic cider, it doesn't have gas and is more similar to the wine.

Even in big cities, only a few areas (San Francisco in Bilbao, for example) are best avoided. Although violent crime is extremely rare, the usual precautions still apply; avoid being alone at night in side streets, keep an eye on pickpockets, and you should do just fine.\n\nThe chances of being affected by ETA are extremely low. The number of ETA attacks has decreased a lot in the past few years ('only' 10 people have been killed by ETA in the past 4 years, 4 of them in the Basque Country), they are usually directed against one person, not many people or any building, and the targets are usually policemen, military, businessmen or politicians. ETA has never targeted visitors to the Basque Country. The ETA have also announced a permanent ceasefire in 2011\n\nAlthough they have also become rarer, there is a chance of seeing acts of vandalism related to radical pro-independence movements, specially if you visit the Basque Country during a big pro-independence-demonstration day or politically relevant dates (the Gudari Eguna, the Aberri Eguna and some city festivals). Don't be alarmed, if you find yourself in the middle of a fight between the police and violent manifestants: do what the basques do, and go to the next street. In 30 min, everything will be probably finished. \n\nIt is advisable not to wear any Spanish symbols (Spain's national football (soccer) team T-shirts, Spanish flags or Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid club paraphernalia).

Add to this the usual right vs. left dimension, and you'll find Basque politics is complex - very complex.  It may be easier to just avoid political topics, to avoid the possibility of offence.\n\nThis diversity of views can be seen, that with a population of just 2 million people there are now 7 different political parties in the Basque Parliament.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nThe charms of southwest ",{"type":"[[","value":[["France"]]},", in particular the beach resorts and town of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Biarritz"]]},", are a short hop across the border.
