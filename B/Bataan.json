Japanese forces started a siege of the peninsula on January 7, 1942, and launched an all-out assault on April 3, a few months after the Battle of the Points. The majority of the American and Filipino forces surrendered on April 9 and were forced to march more than 100 kilometres (62 mi) from Bataan to Tarlac, which became known as the Bataan Death March.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["'By car"]},"\n\nBataan is a little bit over two hours away from Metro Manila.
