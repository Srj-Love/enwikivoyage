Senior citizens, students, and differently abled passengers enjoy a discount: for each, it is ₱6; for tricycles, the minimum is ₱20, regardless of how many will ride.\n\nThe fare schedule (in English) is typically posted inside the jeepney for travellers, although you may ask the driver or other passengers themselves if you are not sure how much you should pay.
