[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Australia-oceania default banner.jpg"],["pgname=Bathurst"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.bathurst.nsw.gov.au Bathurst"]}]}," is a city in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Central West (New South Wales)"],["Central West"]]}," area of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Australia"],["Australian"]]}," state of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New South Wales"]]},", some 200 km west of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sydney"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nFounded in 1815 as the first inland European settlement on the Australian continent, Bathurst quickly became a regional centre of outback expansion and became an exceedingly wealthy town during the first wave of the Australian gold rush in the 1850s.  Today it is a modern rural city, with good visitor facilities.  It plays off its gold rush heritage to attract visitors.\n\nBathurst has greater temperature extremes than its coastal neighbours.  With hot temperatures on many summer days, and an occasional day of snowfall in winter.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nBathurst is approximately three hours drive west of Sydney. Cross the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Blue Mountains"]]}," on either the Great Western Highway from the Penrith area or the Bells Line of Road from the Windsor area. On the other side of the mountains, follow the Great Western Highway from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lithgow"]]}," to Bathurst.\n\nThe road between Lithgow and Bathurst is straight and quick, however expect significant traffic delays when crossing the Blue Mountains away from Sydney on a Friday afternoon or returning to Sydney at the end of a weekend.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train and bus"]},"\n\nTo understand the train services and pricing to and from Bathurst, you need to know a little bit of the history of ownership of train services to Bathurst.\n\nNSW train services were run by two organisations Countrylink and Cityrail.  With Cityrail operating the greater Sydney metropolitan trains, and Countrylink operating the regional state services.  Both of these organisations ran trains to Bathurst - being the furthest extent of the Cityrail network, and also a major destination on the Countrylink network.  Countrylink ran booked services to Bathurst, with the trains running Sydney to Dubbo.  They also ran coaches connecting with the Cityrail trains at Lithgow.  Cityrail also ran the train service (outbound from Bathurst in the morning, and inbound to Bathurst in the evening) between Sydney and Bathurst.  You could book the Countrylink coach either through Cityrail or Countrylink, however the price was considerably cheaper to do so through Cityrail.  The Cityrail train was the same price as the coach.  However, the Countrylink train to Dubbo was more expensive.\n\nIn 2013 these organisations were disbanded, and a new organisation NSW trains took over running all trains to Bathurst.  However, the ticketing and price variations are unchanged.  That is the Bathurst unbooked train is cheaper than the booked service  You can also use the Sydney Trains tickets on the service.  It is also cheaper to book the Bathurst coach this way from Lithgow.  Buy your ticket from a station, and they can book the coach for you. Tickets for these services can only be bought on the day, and MyMulti3 and MyMulti daypass tickets are valid.  If you book the Dubbo service to Bathurst, or for some reason want to book the coach through the NSW Trainlink, the cost will be greater.  \n\nSo, NSW Trainlink ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/nswtrainlink.info\/"]}," runs a daily booked train service from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sydney"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dubbo"]]}," and return that stops at Bathurst outbound in the mornings, and inbound in the afternoons.  This train does give the option of a day-trip to Bathurst.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the unbooked extended Sydney train network to get there, by catching a Lithgow train and changing to a coach at Bathurst.  These connecting services run a few times a day, and take about 30 minutes longer than the booked service but are less than a quarter of the price.  There is also a single unbooked train doing the run from Bathurst to Sydney.  Leaving Sydney every evening and returning the following morning, it is primarily designed to allow Bathurst residents a day in Sydney, but it is a good way to access Bathurst from Sydney on a Friday evening.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nRegional Express ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.rex.com.au\/"]}," offers several flights from Sydney to Bathurst daily.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By coach "]},"\n\nAustralia Wide Coaches ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/austwidecoaches.com.au\/"]}," have an express service from Bathurst to the Sydney City and on to Sydney airport every morning, and return in the afternoon.
