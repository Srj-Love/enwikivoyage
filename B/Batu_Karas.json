Western tourism is booming in Batu Karas mostly due to the beginner surf break, noted as the best place to learn to surf in Indonesia by Lonely Planet.  The break is, unfortunately, quite crowded and lacks the power that more experienced surfers will desire from Indonesian surf.  \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nBatu Karas is approximately one hour away from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pangandaran"]]}," via local transport. The road is quite bumpy, though a new road is currently under construction as of August, 2013. To get to Batu Karas from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pangandaran"]]}," you must first take local transport to Cijulang (8,000 - 10,000 IDR).  From there, hire an ojek to Batu Karas (8,000 to 20,000). It is no longer necessary to traverse the bamboo bridge to get to Batu Karas, though the bridge saves about 30 minutes of drive time to Cijulang.\n\nPrivate transport from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cimaja"]]}," to Batu Karas takes 10-15 hours and should cost between 1,200,000 and 1,300,000 IDR.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nOjeks are the only public transport option in Batu Karas.  Scooters can be rented for 40,000 to 60,000 per day, with the standard one-day rate at 50,000 IDR.  The town is small and there is no pressing need for a scooter unless you want to explore the surrounding breaks.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nGreen Canyon is a popular tourist destination in the vicinity.  Tours can be organized easily at any of the local warungs.  \n\nThe beaches in Batu Karas are surprisingly clean by Indonesian standards.  Be mindful of jelly fish in calmer waters.  \n\nBe sure to check for glowing blue phosphorescence on the beach at night.  \n\nHead east approximately 1km along the beach road to find open stretches of secluded black sand beach.  Be careful of the strong currents in this area if you decide to take a dip.  \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nLearning to surf is the main attraction in Batu Karas.  The main beach has a soft right point break that is perfect for learning, aside from the ever-growing crowds.  There are a few other more advanced breaks in the area though swell consistency is not as strong as in other parts of Indonesia.\n\nSurfboards can be rented on the main beach for 50,000 - 75,000 per day, with cheaper rates for longer rental periods.  Rental board quality is quite standard, but the softness of the wave means most rentals are longboards.\n\nFishing trips can be organized as well. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\nThere are no ATMs in Batu Karas, so be sure to pick up some cash in Cijulang or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pangandaran"]]}," before you arrive.\n\nThe ubiquitous Alphamarts and Indomarets have not descended upon Batu Karas yet.  This means you will need to bargain with the local warungs for basic supplies.  A large mineral water should be no more than 5,000, a bottle of Coke should cost no more than 5,000, and Bintang should be no more than 30,000.  \n\nThere is a pharmacy with limited supplies in the area, ask for directions from a local.  \n\nThere are a couple of surf shops selling new boards, boardshorts, wax, and other basic surf necessities.\n\nFor anything more specific than basic supplies, head back to Cijulang.  \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nPopeye's is a good option, serving both local and western dishes (10,000 - 40,000 per plate).  It is located in the parking area for the main beach, across from Teratai Bungalows.  \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nNights out in Batu Karas are essentially limited to bonfires on the beach accompanied by Bintangs from the local warungs.

For those who require internet service, the best option is to purchase a SIM card; 4G service is relatively strong throughout town, at least for SIMPati\/Telkomsel.  \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nGetting to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pangandaran"]]},":  Hire an ojek to the bus station in Cijulang (ask the warungs at the main beach if you are having trouble finding one) for 8,000 - 20,000 IDR (approximately 20 minutes).  From there take a bemo (blue van) to Pangandaran for 8,000 - 10,000 IDR (approximately one-hour).  The bemo will drop you at the main bus station in Pangandaran. You can walk (approximately 1km) to the main drag and all the hotels in Pangandaran, or hire a bicek (bike taxi) for a fixed 30,000 IDR rate.  If you have not booked accommodations yet the bicek may be free as the hotels have price fixed a 30,000 IDR commission for the bicek drivers.   \n\nThere is something of a transport mafia in Batu Karas for exit travel to Yojakarta.  The heavily advertised train is almost three times the reasonable price, but the price fixing between the travel agents here and in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pangandaran"]]}," makes bargaining impossible.  If you are determined to avoid the 350,000 - 500,000 quoted price, plan on heading to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pangandaran"]]}," for a night and then making your way by bus and train to Yojakarta on your own.  The same pre-planned trip to Yojakarta from Pangandaran is 250,000 IDR.  There are stories of people who tried to book from Pangandaran  for the cheaper price then head back to Batu Karas only to receive a phone call hours later telling them that the price rose to 500,000 IDR.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["West Java"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["no Wikipedia link"]]}]
