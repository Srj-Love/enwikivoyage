There are castle ruins, full castles still being used as residences, local museums, caves, and old mines that most tourists will never see. Some of these are better than the typical €20 fee to join a boring, guided tour at one of the more famous cities in Germany. Why pay a fee for seeing only a small part of the castle when you can find an old castle in the countryside that you can explore and maybe discover something new that is not even documented? It's sad to see tourists who pay too much money to see \"tourist castles\" when the price of a rental car and the will to explore can yield many free or cheap sites, which are sometimes better than the overpriced attractions, that limit what you can see or do.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nThe ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bavarian Alps"]]}," are Bavaria's main attraction for ",{"type":"''","value":["Doing"]}," things. There you can find skiing a snowboard resorts, which are very well maintained and not too expensive, though much smaller than those of neigbouring Austria and Switzerland. In summertime hiking and mountain biking is the sporty thing to do in Bavaria. \n\nAnother great thing to participate are the regular traditional beer festivals. Of course, everybody knows ",{"type":"''","value":["Oktoberfest"]}," in Munich, but actually every city and town in Bavaria has its own festivities at least once a year for a few days.

There can be specials like truffle dishes in the southern mountain areas, specialty mushrooms in the Upper Palatinate area, seasonal salmon dishes on the Danube and Altmuhl area, local trout specials in all small villages, seasonal asparagus dishes, and occasional fresh wild boar and venison dishes during hunting season - Bavaria is a gastronomic wonderland, especially for the meat aficionado!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Beer"]},"\nBavarians love their ",{"type":"'''","value":["beer"]},".

It's good to know that there exists a special ritual with this beer: Normally it will be served in a special glass, called ",{"type":"''","value":["Weißbierglas"]},". But if you get the empty glass and the bottle of beer, you have to fill it by yourself: in one step without dropping the bottle. Weissbier is more carbonated than most other beers and produces a lot of foam so it is not easy to fill without spilling something. \n\nBavaria could easily opt for the title of \"Promised Land of Brewing\".

There, you can find a brewery in almost every village (it is sometimes very small and maintained among a few families). You can find a lot of local beer specialities, as for instance the ",{"type":"''","value":["Bamberger Schlenkerla"]}," (a beer with a taste of smoked bacon). So always try to stick with the local beers - especially tasty (and supposedly healthy) are the unfiltered beers (served only in pubs).\n\nIn summer, you can generally find ",{"type":"'''","value":["beer festivals"]}," everywhere: not only in the bigger cities but also in the smaller villages; be warned, however, that the beer there is normally served in 1 L ceramic glasses called ",{"type":"''","value":["Maß"]},".

If you are touring Upper Bavaria in August, you shouldn´t miss ",{"type":"''","value":["Barthelmarkt"]}," in Oberstimm, next to Ingolstadt, which is one of the oldest traditional beer festivals in Bavaria.

The shade of ancient horse chestnut trees become a rendezvous point for both young and old, white and blue collar workers, rich and not-so-rich, and locals and visitors alike: a place to enjoy a convivial glass of cold local beer and some tasty Bavarian snacks. You can even bring your own food (but not drinks).\n\nFranconia is known as the home of beer cellars. What is called beer gardens in the south are called ",{"type":"'''","value":["beer cellars"]}," in the north.

In Berlin, it might not pose a problem, if you are caught with a few joints in your pocket (because you may carry it for your personal use). In Bavaria, it definitely is a big problem for you. Still, you won't have any problems if you drink alcohol in public as in the rest of Germany and Central Europe.
