It joined the German Empire in 1871 and has been part of Germany ever since. It is the largest federal-state in contemporary Germany. Bavarians are generally more conservative than other Germans and the traditions of the past generations are alive and well in this scenic region of Central Europe. Roman Catholicism also plays an important role in local customs and culture and the Bavarian Alps are home to many beautiful churches and shrines.

Added the fact that the mountains are older in geological terms, they are quite chiseled at their peaks giving the traveler wonderful views like the famous home peak of Berchtesgaden, the Watzmann. Alpine crystal  blue lakes and flowing rivers are abundant in the region as well. Thick fir tree forests hide abundant wildlife and thousands of kilometers of marked hiking trails that could easily lead you over the open frontier to Austria.
