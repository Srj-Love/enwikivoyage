Interstate 5 intersects interstate 80 in Sacramento, however, when coming from the north, Interstate 505 can be used to bypass Sacramento and get to the Bay Area quicker.\n\nParking rates in San Francisco can go up to around $30.  You can park at BART parking lots:\nFor example:\nPark in Colma parking garage $2 all day, free weekends and round trip BART from Colma to Moscone Center would\ncost $6.50 for one person, so two people could park and train for $15 as opposed to $25 for all day parking at the center.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nThe Bay Area is well served by a ",{"type":"'''","value":["network of freeways"]},". Highways 280 and 101 run up the Peninsula from the Silicon Valley to San Francisco, and 101 continues into Marin County across the Golden Gate Bridge. Highways 880 (also called the Nimitz Freeway) and 580 run the length of the East Bay, and Highway 24 runs out to Contra Costa County. All major freeways, particularly those going through San Francisco and Oakland, suffer from severe congestion at commute times.  Interstate 280 and the South Bay freeways and expressways tend to be less congested than the Peninsula and East Bay freeways.\n\nFor a slower but vastly more scenic route, the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pacific Coast Highway"]]}," (also known as PCH and Highway 1) runs along the coast.  In many places this route may not be appropriate for those prone to car sickness or fear of heights, but for all others it provides an unforgettable vista over the Pacific Coast.\n\nNote that many Bay Area freeways tend to have dense traffic at ",{"type":"''","value":["any"]}," time of day or the evening, ",{"type":"''","value":["any"]}," day of the week (even Sundays), and you will be lucky if traffic is actually moving at the speed limit (rather than far below it). This is particularly true of the Eastshore Freeway in Berkeley and the James Lick Skyway in San Francisco.  Other freeways, such as Interstate 280 on the Peninsula, are congested only during rush hours on weekdays and are relatively easy to drive at all other times.  You can get traffic reports 24 hours a day from several radio stations, most notably KCBS (740 AM and 106.9 FM) which has traffic and weather reports every ten minutes on the eights (:08, :18, :28, :38, :48, and :58).\n\nThere is a proportion of \"hurried\" drivers that will zig-zag between cars at high speeds. In the North Bay, there are fast succession of freeway interchanges; a misunderstanding may land you on the wrong freeway, even on a bridge you do not intend to take. Interchanges are signposted with road numbers and compass directions, but even these may be confusing: the same stretch of road may carry several numbers and opposite compass directions between these numbers. Read a map carefully before driving or have a passenger watch for directions.\n\nNote that since tolls are charged only one-way on the toll bridges, you should plan road trips to minimize the number of times you traverse bridges in the toll direction.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Bart-map.svg"],["thumb"],["280px"],["Map of the BART system"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.bart.gov Bay Area Rapid Transit"]}]}," (BART) is an extensive regional metro system that connects San Francisco to the East Bay and Contra Costa County, as well as parts of the Peninsula, the eastern half of Silicon Valley, and the San Francisco and Oakland airports. BART is also useful for getting around within SF and Oakland. Ticket prices vary by distance traveled, but usually run about $2–5 one way and tickets can be purchased from vending machines at any station. You will need to insert your ticket into barriers when entering and exiting the system. Tickets hold a balance, deducting the appropriate price for each trip, so someone who plans to use the system several times can buy a $10 or $20 ticket and not worry about fares until the card is used up. Note that the BART vending machines accept any credit card only twice within any 24 hour period.  Trains run about every 10–20 minutes starting around 6AM and closing just after midnight.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Caltrain map.svg"],["thumb"],["280px"],["Map of Caltrain system"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.caltrain.com Caltrain"]}]}," is a commuter train system running along the Peninsula between San Francisco, San Jose and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gilroy (California)"],["Gilroy"]]},". Ticket prices vary by the distance between stations, but usually run around $3-6 one way. Trains run about once every half hour, on average, once an hour late evenings and weekends, with several more trains running during commute hours. This train service is not particularly fast; however, in a move to improve speed, many trains during commute hours run express or semi-express service, so they do not stop at all stations. Tickets must be purchased before boarding the train from ticket vending machines at any of the stations or from ticket clerks at staffed stations. Tickets are checked on the trains and anyone found without a ticket is liable to a substantial fine. Cyclists should use the designated car at the northern end of the train, and be aware that bike space is often limited during commute hours.\n\nA full list of Bay Area public transportation agencies, as well as a refreshingly useful trip planner, can be found at the Metropolitan Transportation Commissions's web site ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/511.org 511.org"]}]},".  This planner is more useful than Google maps, as the Bay Area has so many transit agencies navigating them is a chore and not all of them are on Google.
