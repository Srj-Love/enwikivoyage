The first 2 are connected via the Kumbor strait, while the Verige strait connects the gulf of Tivat with the gulfs of Risan and Kotor. The total area equals 88 square kilometres.\n\nDue to its unusual look, the bay is often called Europe's southernmost fjord, but in fact it's a submerged river canyon.\n\nThe territory of the bay of Boka Kotorska is divided into 3 municipalities: ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kotor"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Herceg Novi"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tivat"]]},".
