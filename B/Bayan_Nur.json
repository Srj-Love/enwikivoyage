Central areas speak the Jin dialect of Chinese. The two dialects are mutually unintelligible. The official dialect of Mongolian is Chahar and is distinct form the dialect used in the Republic of Mongolia. The Mongolian language and population is primarily in the northern and border regions of Inner Mongolia with the neighboring Republic of Mongolia to the north.\n\nWriting on signs, menus and other documents is usually in both Mongolian and Chinese Hanzi scripts.
