It was a major center of learning and religion for the region at the time. However, the communist government destroyed most of the temples and executed many of the monks. In the early 1990s, a small concrete ger was established on the site in an effort to restore Tibetan Buddhism. There are several other active monasteries nearby, plus ruins of other also destroyed by the communists. The city is situated near the northern boundary of the Govi Desert with desert to the south and steppe and forests to the north. Outside of the city are many hot springs, rivers, lakes, oases, and the Great Gobi A National Park.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh =  -11.4"],["febhigh =  -7.2"],["marhigh =   -1.1"],["aprhigh =   8.9"],["mayhigh =  17.4"],["junhigh =   22.1"],["julhigh =   23.0"],["aughigh =   21.5"],["sephigh =   15.9"],["octhigh =   7.6"],["novhigh =   -3.1"],["dechigh =   -9.5"],["janlow =   -23.7"],["feblow =   -22.4"],["marlow =  -14.8"],["aprlow =   -5.8"],["maylow =  2.0"],["junlow =   7.9"],["jullow =  10.1"],["auglow =  8.2"],["seplow =  2.1"],["octlow =   -5.7"],["novlow =   -16.1"],["declow =   -22.1"],["janprecip =  2.0"],["febprecip =  2.8"],["marprecip =  4.1"],["aprprecip =  8.6"],["mayprecip =  14.4"],["junprecip =  33.3"],["julprecip =  56.2"],["augprecip =  48.2"],["sepprecip =  18.3"],["octprecip =  7.0"],["novprecip =  2.7"],["decprecip =  1.8"],["description = NOAA (1961-1990)"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThere is a bus that goes from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ulaanbaatar"]]}," everyday at 8AM.
