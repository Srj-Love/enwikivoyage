Many stores are part of a local Merchants' Association or group where they get special discounts to pass along to their customers and visitors.  Even if they can't offer you lodging discounts, they probably have had many guests who have stayed at local accommodations and can pass along any recommendations of where to stay or where to avoid.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Call Ahead "]},"\n\nIt's always a good idea when planning your shopping trip to call ahead to confirm the stores hours, even if their hours are listed on their website.  Local holidays, shortened off-season hours, or other reasons may from time to time deter the owner or staff from opening and it's better to be safe than sorry.  Also, many bead stores would be delighted to hear about someone coming from a great distance solely to see their shop.  They might be able to inform you if there are any special events such as trunk shows, book signings, or classes taking place during your stay.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nDue to issues of global supply and demand, geopolitics and circumstances beyond the shop owners' control, you may never see that same attractive bead offered for sale ever again in your lifetime.\n\nIn addition, some types of beads that are easier to source than others (such as Austrian crystals), still have dye lots, where the color will vary slightly from lot to lot (much as you may see color differences in different lots of textiles such as carpet.)\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Buy plenty of beads and beading material now to make the projects you need."]},"\n\nCheck in advance for forms of payment accepted by the bead shops.

However, not every shop will accept every form of payment.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Classes & In-Store Events"]},"\nWhen planning your bead trip, be sure to check your destination store's website or listing of class offerings.  You may be able to plan your trip around an exciting in-store event, visiting artist class, trunk show or some other 'not-to-miss' event.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nSome bead shops allow you to bring your own wine or have hosted events that include wine and assorted beverages. You should check first with the bead shop before assuming that you can bring wine - or any other food or beverage - into the shop.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nIf the neighborhood where the bead shop is located looks safe, then you are probably safe too. Remember that the bead shops serve their local customers, who also wish to be safe.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Tipping"]},"\n\nTipping bead shop staff who help you beyond cashing you out is permissible, acceptable and highly appreciated.  However some bead shops may have a policy against it.  A sincere thank you and acknowledgment of good customer service is always appreciated.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Beadwork"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["PartOfTopic"],["Shopping"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Outlinetopic"]]}]
