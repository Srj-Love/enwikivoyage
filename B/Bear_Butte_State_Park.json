In more recent times, however, the Cheyenne and Lakota people have maintained a spiritual tie to this mountain. \n\nNotable leaders including Red Cloud, Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull have all visited Bear Butte. These visits culminated with an 1857 gathering of many Indian nations to discuss the advancement of white settlers into the Black Hills. \n\nGeorge A. Custer, who led an expedition of 1,000 men into the region, camped near the mountain. Custer verified the rumors of gold in the Black Hills.
