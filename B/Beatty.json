Established in 1905, the town was named after Montillus (Montillion), Murray \"Old Man\" Beatty, who settled on a ranch in the Oasis Valley in 1896 and became the town's first postmaster. With the arrival of the Las Vegas and Tonopah Railroad in 1905, Beatty became a railway center for the Bullfrog Mining District, including mining towns such as nearby Rhyolite. Starting in the 1940s, Nellis Air Force Base and other federal installations contributed to the town's economy as did tourism related to Death Valley National Park and the rise of Las Vegas as an entertainment center.\n\nBeatty is home to the Beatty Museum and Historical Society, a casino, and hundreds of motel rooms and recreational vehicle spaces. The ghost town of Rhyolite and the Goldwell Open Air Museum  (a sculpture park), are both about 4 miles to the west, and Yucca Mountain and the Nevada Test Site are about 18 miles to the east. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nBeatty is located at the intersection of US Highway 95 and Nevada State Route 374.\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/mccarran.com McCarran International Airport"]}]}," in Las Vegas, from which US-95 goes straight to Beatty, is the nearest airport.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n\nArt exhibits on the way to ghost town do stop and spend time I to drive Stove Pipe Wells  on 35 mile DIRT ROAD up and over a pass at about 4,000 feet through a deserted silver mine town that existed for 2 years and finally through Titus canyon it self, ending in Stove Pipe Wells CA.

If you are under age or without a valid ID to prove your age and found in the gambling premises, hotel staff will ask you to leave, and could ask the metro police to issue you a citation.

Rhyolite was founded in 1905 after gold was discovered in the area, and within a few years its population had grown to 8,000 people. Rhyolite reached its heyday about 1908, when it was the third largest city in Nevada. At this time it had 3 railroads, 3 newspapers, 3 hospitals, 19 hotels, 18 stores, an opera house, a symphony, about 50 mines and most importantly, 53 saloons.  By 1914 the gold mines were exhausted and the decline of the city was as fast as its growth. In 1919 the post office was officially closed and the last inhabitants moved out. Rhyolite quickly became a ghost town as the disintegration of the buildings started and the desert took back its territory.  Today all the wooden houses are gone, and just a few stone buildings are still standing. The Bureau of Land Management has volunteers during the daytime hours. Rhyolite is the home of the World Famous Bottle House made of 30,000 bottles. The most photographed ruin in Nevada is the Cook Bank further up Golden Street. Known as the \"Golden Horseshoe\", Rhyolite was the mining center for the Bullfrog Mining District. Classic ruins, interesting history and a day of exploring awaits you."]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=US 95.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["directionl1=N"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fallon"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tonopah"]]}],["directionr1=S"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Las Vegas"]]}],["minorr1=Jct ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Nevada 373.svg"],["18px"]]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Death Valley Junction"],["S"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["rtarrow"]]}," Jct ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Nevada 160.svg"],["18px"]]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pahrump"],["S"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["36.909444"],["-116.754444"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Southern Nevada"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Beatty, Nevada"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North_America\/United_States\/Nevada\/Localities\/B\/Beatty\/"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Beatty, Nevada"]]}]
