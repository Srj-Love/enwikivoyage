There is no mall, big box stores, or movie house, however, movies can be rented at several island stores and television is available around most of the island.  Wireless internet service is free at the library and other locations around the island. There are local bars that many enjoy spending their time.  Hunting, camping, fishing, biking, and hiking are some of the recreational offerings.  \n\nThe different attractions around the island may not be on the high-end scale of other islands but this is what helps top make the island unique. The first visual attraction a traveler may notice is the island is almost entirely covered in forested areas. After setting foot on the island one may want to go around and see what there is to see. Some good things to see is the beaches such as the one simply known as the Public Beach, Donegal Bay, and Iron Ore Bay are all great places to spend time for any beach goers. For anyone interested in the island's history can visit the island's Historical Museum to learn and even see some of the history. The island also has two well known lighthouses, one on the northern end and one on the southern. The southern end lighthouse is usually open to the public anytime. \n\nFor anyone into fishing, the Island has around 7 inland lakes, however not all are great fishing areas. The best or most popular ones are Lake Genesereth (the largest), Fox Lake, Barney's Lake, and Font Lake. \n\nFor the bikers and hikers out there, this place has a good amount of it. While the island may not be very large, hence it won't take too long to get through, it has some nice and beautiful trails to travel through.  \n\nThe Shamrock Restaurant and Pub is a bright spot around the harbor.  The food is excellent with a great assortment of drink available. Nina's Restaurant in the Beaver Island Lodge is also very nice and fits the upscale palate quite well. Stoney Acre Grill is another Pub with a restaurant that also has a good assortment of drink as well as good food.\n\nA few easily accessible shipwrecks and ruined docks surround the island. In Little Sand Bay there's a keel in hardly a meter of water. Remnants of a dock and some machinery are on the beach near the southern lighthouse.\n\nIf someone is looking for a city-like place with busy street, thousands upon thousands of people, malls, outlet stores, numerous generic restaurants, and whatever else a city might generally have, Beaver Island is not that kind of place. It is instead a place to get away from all of that. It is a great getaway place and that is especially true in the summer time. It offers a nice change of pace from the busy cities of America.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\nThe island has a family-run Spartan grocery, McDonough's Market, (a regional network of stores) and has a good selection of produce and food and is a good place to do grocery shopping.

The island's gas station, Island Energies or more commonly known simply as \"the gas station\" or even \"the four corners store,\" is located on the way out of town at an intersection locally known as the four corners and has a small selection of food, alcohol, and even some unique gift shop like items. While some may complain about the prices of gas being high than that of the mainland, one should try to understand this is because of the fact that, along with every other type of product coming to the island, it costs more to ship it there.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Daddy Franks Restaurant"]},", +1 231-448-2570.
