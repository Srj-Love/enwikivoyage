It is an important shopping centre, and there are also many pubs and bars. There are a number of good ethnic restaurants, reflecting the town's substantial Italian, Indian, Pakistani, and Polish communities. Bedford has also been heralded for having the widest range of ethnic diversity, boasting one of the few Eskimos in Britain. The Embankment along the River Ouse running through the centre of town is an attractive place for a walk, and once a year is given over to a traditional Regatta. On the picturesque town bridge is a memorial to John Bunyan, the author of 'The Pilgrim's Progress', who was imprisoned there. John Bunyan also lived in Bedford for most of his life, writing The Pilgrim's Progress here, and his life can be seen at the John Bunyan Museum in the town, where a statue dedicated to him can also be seen. There is a large and attractive park with tennis courts, and other niceties north of the town centre (Bedford Park).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\nBedford is served by East Midlands Trains, London Midland and First Capital Connect. Travel to\/from London St. Pancras takes about 40 minutes by East Midlands Trains and just over an hour if you take the First Capital Connect train. First Capital Connect trains are slower as they are primarily commuter services. The East Midlands Trains services only stop at a couple of stations between Bedford & London.\n\nThere is also a minor railway line going west to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bletchley"]]}," (near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Milton Keynes"]]},"). Bedford's second train station (Bedford St. John's) is only used by Bletchley trains, whereas all trains going to\/from Bedford end up in the main Bedford station sooner or later.\n\nEast Midlands Trains go north to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nottingham"]]}," and beyond.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nBedford has a reasonably large bus station located in the centre of town, however there are few long distance services. The bus station and Midland train station are about 800m apart, so it's a max 10 min walk if you need to make a change here.\n\nBedford is on the X5 bus route between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oxford"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Milton Keynes"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cambridge (England)"],["Cambridge"]]},".

Just about everything you'd want to see is within easy walking distance of the high street, however (at most 30 minutes if you're slow), so there's little need for anything more than your feet in good weather.\n\nThere's a reasonable but underused shuttle bus leaving the central train station, and the bus service to surrounding villages is excellent.\n\nThere are very few provisions for cyclists, though the town centre is pedestrianised. The one way system and endless traffic lights around the centre make for fun riding until you get to know the roads. Reasonably wide roads mean you don't get squeezed off too often.\n\nTaxis are relatively expensive in Bedford & you may expect to queue for some time at town centre taxi ranks. It is usually faster & cheaper to call for a licenced minicab rather than waiting in line.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Embankment of the River Great Ouse"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat=52.13473"],["long=-0.46078"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Bunyan Museum"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.bedfordmuseum.org\/johnbunyanmuseum\/bunyan_home.htm"],["email="],["address=Mill Street, MK40 3EU"],["lat=52.13676"],["long=-0.46358"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Open March - October Tue-Sat 11AM-4PM"],["price=Free"],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=The Higgins Bedford"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.thehigginsbedford.org.uk\/"],["email="],["address=Castle Lane, MK40 3XD"],["lat=52.13635"],["long=-0.46369"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Tue – Sat 11AM–5PM, Sun 2PM–5PM"],["price= Admission Free"],["content=Art gallery and Museum containing a good range of Anglo-Saxon and Roman artefacts, and 19th century art."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Bedford Park"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.bedford.gov.uk\/leisure_and_culture\/parks_and_open_spaces\/bedford_park.aspx"],["email="],["address=Park Avenue"],["lat=52.1466"],["long=-0.4647"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content= A large Victorian park to the North of the town centre."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Castle Mound"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.pastscape.org.uk\/hob.aspx?hob_id=360158"],["email="],["address="],["lat=52.13539"],["long=-0.46335"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=outside - always open"],["price=free"],["content=The remains of a castle built in 919 and destroyed in 1224, near the river embankment."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=St Paul's Church"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.stpaulschurchbedford.org.uk\/"],["email="],["address=St Pauls Square, MK40 1SQ"],["lat=52.13545"],["long=-0.46732"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content= An interesting church with over 700 years history."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=St Peter's Church"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.stpeter.org.uk\/"],["email="],["address=De Parys Avenue, MK40 2TX"],["lat=52.13937"],["long=-0.46645"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Priory Park"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.bedford.gov.uk\/leisure_and_culture\/parks_and_open_spaces\/priory_country_park.aspx"],["email="],["address="],["lat=52.1321"],["long=-0.4339"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=free"],["content=A large area of open land of the Eastern edge of town, featuring a man-made lake and nature reserve."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Willington Dovecote and Stables"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.nationaltrust.org.uk\/willington-dovecote-and-stables\/"],["email=willingtondovecote@nationaltrust.org.uk"],["address=Willington, Church End, near Bedford, MK44 3PX"],["lat=52.137501"],["long=-0.3808"],["directions=4 miles east of Bedford"],["phone=+44 1284 747500"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Apr - Sep: Last Sunday of month or by appointment"],["price="],["content=16th century stone dovecote"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hire a boat"]}," on the rowing lake near the river.
