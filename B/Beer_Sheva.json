[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Mena-asia_default_banner.jpg"],["unesco=yes"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Be'er Sheva"]}," (also spelled ",{"type":"'''","value":["Beersheba"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["Hebrew"]}," באר שבע) is a desert city of approximately 200,000 inhabitants in southern ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Israel"]]},". It is the sixth largest city in the country and is very much the gateway to the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Negev"]]}," region of Israel. The city is spread out by Israeli standards, as there is no shortage of land in the desert, and there isn't much of a downtown, except for a few streets in the old Turkish quarter. While Beer Sheva is mostly middle class, it does have three wealthy satellite suburbs with manicured landscapes, private villas and a Palm Springs feel to them: ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Omer"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Metar"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lehavim"]]},". A few Bedouin villages surround the city as well. Some feature tribal attractions which are worth a visit, including ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rahat"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tel Sheva"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hura"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Laqiya"]]},". In Beer Sheva itself, some modern\/experimental architecture was built in the 1960s. Today, this is found mostly in government and public buildings, including the Ben Gurion University and Soroka Hospital buildings.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nBeer Sheva is at first sight highly disappointing for any visitor. As one enters the city, the oversized avenues and partially run down residential building blocks from the fifties and sixties make for an unwelcoming first impression. However, Beer Sheva can be of interest for any traveller who wishes to experience Israel off-the-beaten-track and there might be no better place to do this, since not even most Israelis are aware that Beer Sheva can be much more than only a stopover on the way to Eilat. The old Turkish town, as run down as it might be, has a very distinct feel and a is hugely underrated: it is the only planned Ottoman city in the entire region, erected in 1900 for strategic reasons in order to secure the Negev region and to control the restive Bedouin population. Today, the architectural and historical jewels, culinary highlights, highly welcoming people and the provincial atmosphere of Beer Sheva allow for the visitor to explore the \"normal\" and \"unpretentious\" Israel beyond ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tel Aviv"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jerusalem"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Haifa"]]},". In addition to that, Beer Sheva offers a vibrant student community - based around the university - which has developed a great nightlife one would never expect at first sight.\n\nBeer Sheva and its surroundings give a feel of Israel's strength. On the way down from the north, endless fields with agriculture have replaced desolate dessert; as Isaiah prophesied: \"Thirsty deserts will be glad; barren lands will celebrate and blossom with flowers\". Also, like Tel-Aviv, a modern skyskraper city has been created out of virtually nothing. Yet, an exciting feel of desert has remained, as Beer Sheva looks with one side right into the Negev desert.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nBeer Sheva's importance is its function as a central place for the entire Negev. Historically it developed because of the many wells, the most famous of it being \"Abraham's Well\".\n\nBiblically, the site of Beersheba is where Abraham and his son Isaac made oaths of non-aggression with the Philistines, represented by a king named Abimelech. Abraham lived in the city for 26 years and his son Isaac lived there for many years as well. It is from there that Jacob set out on his journey to \"Haran\" the birthplace of his mother, to flee from his brother Esau.\n\nBeersheba is also mentioned in Joshua 19:2. It was the southernmost city of Israel in Biblical times - hence the expression \"from Dan to Beersheba\" was sometimes used to describe the whole kingdom.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Name"]},"\nBetween the two Abimelech stories in Genesis, there are several different possible etymologies for Beersheba's name:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" in memory of the oath of Abraham and Abimelech (well of the oath)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" in memory of seven wells dug by Isaac (seven wells), though only three or four are identified"]},{"type":"*","value":[" in memory of the oath of Isaac and Abimelech (well of the oath)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" in memory of the seven ewes which stood witness to Abraham and Abimelech's oath (well of the seven)."]},"\nIn Hebrew, the word for oath, \"shava\" and seven, \"sheva\" are essentially the same, hence some scholars think that the name Be'er Sheva always referred to the original oath between Abraham and Abimelech and the seven ewes were simply a sign of peace as was customary in those times.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nA very comfortable train ride links the city to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tel Aviv"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Haifa"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Netanya"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nahariyya"]]}," with hourly departures.
