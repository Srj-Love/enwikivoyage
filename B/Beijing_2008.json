The former is mainly for long-haul trips, such as Beijing to Shanghai or the international trains directly to Moscow, Ulan Bator and Pyongyang, etc. Beijing South is for fast EMU trains to Tianjin, Shanghai, Qingdao, Jinan and etc. Beijing West is for trains run on Jingguang and JingJiu lines.

Among the must-see attractions, such as the famous Forbidden City – where visitors can stroll through the residences of China’s former emperors – and the monolithic Great Wall of China, the Beijing tourism authority has suggested a number of culinary and nightlife hotspots too.\n\nOn the list, include the happening Houhai Bar Street and famous restaurants Kaorou Ji and Dasanyuan. But tourists looking for a taste off the beaten track, should aim for restaurants recommended or populated by locals\n\nOther recommendations include visiting the Drum Tower, Beijing’s ‘Big Ben’ and original time-keeper. Around the tower is an antique market worth exploring and the bustling Hutong fruit market. Other interesting parts of Beijing include the Underground City near Tiananmen Square, a subterranean network built when the country feared Soviet invasion in the 1960s and the Ancient Observatory, an incredibly preserved Tibetan temple.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Venues"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Inside Beijing"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=National Olympic Stadium"],["alt=The Birds Nest"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=The main sports arena, shaped like a bird's nest.
