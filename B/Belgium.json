It marries both the historical landmarks for which the continent is famous with spectacular modern architecture and rural idylls, whilst its capital, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brussels"]]},", is home to the headquarters of the European Union.\n\nDespite this, Belgium is not without its divisions. On the contrary, Flanders, the northern part of the country that speaks Dutch and Wallonia, the southern, French-speaking area are frequently at loggerheads and it sometimes seems that their quarrels will split the country in two. Yet, despite this apparent incompatibility, the two halves of Belgium come together to form a country that contains some of Europe's most attractive and historical cities and is a true 'must-see' for any visitor to the continent.\n\nLying on the North Sea coast, Belgium's immediate neighbours are ",{"type":"[[","value":[["France"]]}," to the south-west, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Luxembourg"]]}," to the south-east, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Germany"]]}," to the east and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Netherlands"]]}," to the north.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nBelgium is a densely populated country trying to balance the conflicting demands of urbanization, transportation, industry, and commercial and intensive agriculture. It imports large quantities of raw materials and exports a large volume of manufactured goods, mostly to the EU.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nBelgium is the heir of several former Medieval powers, and you will see traces of these everywhere during your trip in this country.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Carolingian Empire in the 9th century, the territory that is nowadays Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg, was part of Lotharingia, an ephemeral kingdom soon to be absorbed into the Germanic Empire; however, the special character of \"Lower Lotharingia\" remained intact in the feudal Empire : this is the origin of the Low Countries, a general term that encompasses present-day Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg.\n\nThe widely autonomous fiefdoms of the Low Countries were among the richest places in Medieval Europe and you will see traces of this past wealth in the rich buildings of Bruges, Brussels, Antwerp, Ghent, Leuven, Tournai, Mons, etc. These cities progressively fell under the control of a powerful and ambitious family : the Dukes of Burgundy. The whole realm of the dukes extended from the Low Countries to the borders of Switzerland. Using wealth, strategy, and alliances, the Dukes of Burgundy aimed at reconstituting Lotharingia. The death of the last Duke, Charles the Bold, put an end to this dream. However, the treasures of the Dukes of Burgundy remains as a testimony of their rules in Belgian museums and landmarks.\n\nThe powerful Habsburg family then inherited from the Low Countries. Reformation is the reason that Belgium and Netherlands were first put apart: the northern half of the Low Countries embraced Protestantism and rebelled against the Habsburg rule, while the southern half remained faithful to both its ruler and the Catholic faith. These two halves roughly corresponds to present-day Belgium and Netherlands.\n\nBelgium was called Austrian Netherlands, then Spanish Netherlands, depending on which branch of the Habsburg ruled it. The powerful German emperor and Spanish king, Charles V, was born in the Belgian city of Ghent and ruled from Brussels. Many places in Belgium are named after him, including the city of Charleroi and even a brand of beer. Every year, the Brusselers emulates his first parade in their city in what is called the Ommegang.\n\nBelgium was briefly a part of the Napoleonic Empire. After Napoleon's defeat, a large Kingdom of the Netherlands was created, comprising the whole of the Low Countries. However, the religious opposition still remained and the split was aggravated by political differences between Belgian liberals and Dutch aristocrats. Belgium became independent from the Netherlands in 1830 after a short revolution and a war against the Netherlands.\n\nIt was occupied by Germany during World Wars I and II and has many war graves near the battle zones, most of them are around Ieper (in English, archaically rendered as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ypres"]]},", with Yperite another name for mustard gas due to intensive use there in WWI). It has prospered in the past half century as a modern, technologically advanced European state and member of NATO and the EU. Tensions between the Dutch-speaking Flemings of the north and the French-speaking Walloons of the south have led in recent years to constitutional amendments granting these regions formal recognition and autonomy.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Terrain"]},"\nFlat coastal plains in northwest, central rolling hills, wooded hills and valleys of Ardennes Forest in southeast.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nTemperate; mild winters with cool summers.

A stop-gap service from Brussels to Den Haag (The Hague) is planned to start operation in early 2013 until such time as a reliable high-speed service can be re-introduced.\n\nInternational trains connect with domestic trains at Brussels' Gare du Midi\/Zuidstation, and with all Eurostar or ICE and some Thalys tickets, you can finish your journey for free on domestic trains.

Both in Lille and Brussels the staff are very helpful and willing to smile.\n\nThe trains are punctual and mostly modern and comfortable.\n\nNormal fares on Belgian trains are cheap compared to Germany or the UK, with no need nor a possibility to prebook or reserve. 2nd class fares don't go much higher than €20 for the longest domestic trips, and 1st class costs 50% extra.

Some mayor festivals and concert like Rock Werchter, Pukkelpop or I Love Techno include train travel in the ticket price. For visiting special places like theme parks or museums, inform for the option 'B-Excursions'. That way you buy your entrance ticket and train ticket in one at the train station.

Only Brussels and Antwerp have a subway, but, even there, you can make your way around on foot. The historic center of Brussels is only about 300 by 400 m long.

You're most likely to encounter such crossings in urban and suburban areas. Observant visitors will notice a lot of cars with dents along their right sides! Drive defensively and your car will avoid the same fate.\n\nIn Belgium the motorway signs are notoriously inconvenient, especially on secondary roads.

A good roadmap (Michelin, De Rouck, Falk) or a GPS system is recommended.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Car Hire"]},"\nSome hire cars come equipped with sat nav but it's a good idea to request this when you book your car.

Like other European countries in medieval times, beers were brewed in a huge variety of ways with many different ingredients. In addition to the standard ingredients of water, malted barley, hops and yeast, many herbs and spices were also used. This activity was often done in monasteries, each developing a particular style. For some reason, uniquely in Belgium many of these monasteries survived almost into modern times, and the process was handed over to a local commercial brewer if the monastery closed. These brewers would often augment the recipe and process slightly to soften the taste to make it more marketable, but the variety survived in this way. These beers are called ",{"type":"'''","value":["Abbey beers"]}," and there are hundreds and hundreds with a range of complex tastes unimaginable until you've tried them.\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Trappist"]}," label is controlled by international law, similar to that of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Champagne"]}," in France.  There are only six Trappist Abbeys in Belgium that produce beer qualified to be called ",{"type":"'''","value":["Trappist"]},". In order to carry the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Trappist"]}," label, there are several rules that must be adhered to during the brewing process. The beer must be fermented within the walls of the abbey, the monks of the abbey must be involved in the beer-making process, and profit from the sale of the beer must be directed towards supporting the monastery (similar to a non-profit organization).\n\nBelgium offers an incredible diversity of beers.
