It lies on the confluence of the Sava and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Danube"]]}," rivers. The city has a long history, dating back to the 4th century BC, when the area was settled by Celtic tribes. Later on, it became the Roman city of Singidunum, and relics of that era can still be seen in the city, particularly at Kalemegdan Fortress. During the Middle Ages the town became a Serbian stronghold until the Ottoman invasion. The city changed hands between the Ottomans and the Austrians several times until 1878 when Serbia got its independence and Belgrade became the capital of the new country.\n\nAfter the First World War, Belgrade became the seat of Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (in 1928, the country changed name to Kingdom of Yugoslavia) until its collapse, and it saw violence again in 1999 with NATO's bombing campaign. This often violent history and outside influence has colored much of Belgrade's evolution, which is evident in its culture and architecture. Often caught between the hammer and anvil of clashing empires, the city has taken on a unique character, reminiscent of both Austrian and Turkish influences, with a unique set of Communist elements thrown in as Yugoslavia was expelled from the Eastern Bloc in 1948 but followed its own brand of Communism until the years following Marshal Tito's death in 1980. Yet, the city has its own spirit, and in it can be found some not only unique features, but also a healthy ",{"type":"''","value":["joie de vivre"]}," in its café culture, nightlife and often Mediterranean flavor in its view of life.\n\nWhilst there isn't much by way of ethnic or cultural diversity in Belgrade, in terms of different migrant populations – compared to other European cities – there are minority communities (largely Roma and Chinese), as well as people from other former Yugoslav republics, such as Bosnia, Croatia and Macedonia. There is also a small expat community. Cultural events from round the world, however, are starting to be increasingly common, particularly in the spring and summer months, thanks in no small part to both local arts and culture organizations, as well as foreign embassies\/cultural centers. These attract a good deal of local attention, and will help in raising the city's profile as a cultural hotspot.\n\nBelgrade is an energetic city re-discovering its tourism potential.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Serbia Beograd SANU - Feb 2006.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Building of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By plane "]},"\nBelgrade is serviced by ",{"type":"'''","value":["Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["BEG"]]},") ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.beg.aero\/code\/navigate.php?Id=54"]},", about 12 kilometers west of the city center, and is the home base of Air Serbia – Serbia's flag carrier airline – which flies to nearly 40 destinations worldwide.

You can only stay for 3, 2 or 1 hours, respectively, in those spots. You can pay using the machine usually found near the parking spots, buy the parking ticket at a kiosk or by cell phone (just text your car's license plate number (for example: BG123AA) to numbers 9111 (red zone), 9112 (yellow) or 9113 (green)). Every message you send is valid for one hour and, some 5 minutes before the hour has passed, you get a text message telling you that you can send another SMS if you want to extend your parking for the next hour. Of course, this only applies in yellow and green zones, in which you can park for more than 1 hour. After the time is up, you'll have to re-park or risk paying a fine (around €15). All of this only applies on weekdays, from 7AM to 9PM and from 7AM to 2PM on Saturdays. After that (Sa 2PM – Mo 7AM) parking is free.\n\nThere are also several public parking garages and parking lots where you can park for an unlimited amount of time during day. Fees are charged on an hourly basis (price varies, usually around €0.7-0.9\/hour). In some non-zoned areas, you also pay for parking depending on the duration of your stay, and this is paid in cash to the parking attendant.\n\nDetailed information can be found on the Parking Service website ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.parking-servis.co.rs\/en\/"]},".\n\nParking violations are dealt with rather swiftly in the city center and with less commitment in the peripheral zones. Failure to pay for parking in a marked spot is handled by parking enforcement officers and can only result in a fine which would be difficult to collect if you're operating a foreign licensed vehicle. On the other hand, illegally parked vehicles are handled by the traffic police. Once spotted, the police are required to wait for 15 minutes for the driver to return. If you do return in time, you will be issued a sanction and a fine (around €50). When the 15 minutes are up, your car will get towed to one of 4 designated lots in the city. You may locate it using an online service http:\/\/www.parking-servis.co.rs\/en\/vehicle_towing\/where_is_my_vehicle. Once at the lot, you will be required to present a valid form of ID and the vehicle matriculation papers, pay the mandatory fine and towing expenses (around €90 in total).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By bicycle "]},"\n\nOld Belgrade is pretty hilly and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["cycling"]]}," infrastructure is scarce, so bicycle transport isn't in wide use.

There is also more than 50 bicycle racks around the city.\n\nRiding a bike on the same roads with cars and buses is considered too dangerous, although on smaller streets it can be reasonably safe. Avoid riding on major (multilane) roads.

Euros, US dollars and Swiss francs can be changed everywhere. VIP menjačnice (several locations, including the main bus station) and Micko (on Vuka Karadzica street) change all currencies, including rare ones. In Belgrade there are no \"tourist trap\" exchange rate tricks of the kind found in central ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Prague"]]}," and elsewhere in Europe, nor is there a black market offering better rates.\n\nThere are many ATMs, which accept foreign bank and credit cards without a glitch (note: they are new machines so you won’t have any problems with them). Visa, Visa Electron, MasterCard and Maestro are widely accepted though there are some shops, restaurants and hotels where cards are not accepted (these are very few nowadays). American Express and Diners Club cards are, on the other hand, rarely accepted. Likewise, traveler's cheques are not a well known form of payment in Serbia and cashing them in could present a challenge. The dinar is not widely convertible outside Serbia; it is advisable to re-convert your remaining dinars to Euros or other major currencies before leaving the country. Old Yugoslavian currency can be purchased from street sellers. A 500 billion dinar note makes an interesting souvenir. At Kalemegdan you can pick up a set of 10 banknotes from the hyperinflation era plus 2 gratis postcards of Belgrade for 500 dinars or 5 euro.\n\nThe stores work into late hours during work days while on Saturdays they normally close around 15.00 and most of them are not open on Sundays. Therefore, finding an activity for the weekend must be thought of beforehand. Exception to this rule are shopping malls, usually working every day including Sunday until evening hours (usually 10PM).\n\nAt night, there are bars, cafés and discothèques that are open, selling cheaply priced drinks.

It is also worth visiting a pijaca (green market) to buy some fresh fruit, vegetables and other grocery items. The farmer's market at Zeleni Venac, close to the Hotel Moscow, is not one of the largest, but it is the one with the least expensive merchandise – in the city. Contained in a newly-built complex, it makes for an enjoyable Saturday morning experience, with the lively hustle and bustle of people milling about and stall-owners trying to attract customers. Depending on the season, an amazing assortment of fruit and veg can be found in farmer's markets, including watermelons, olives, wild mushrooms and fresh figs. Take the time to explore the stalls, and compare the quality and prices of the produce.

Coffee culture in Belgrade is particularly developed, walking about the central areas of the city you will find sprawling terraces and cafés, serving all types of coffee and sweets, particularly Viennese type cakes and local specialties. Be sure to try Serbian Turkish style coffee, and chestnut purée with whipped cream, a local specialty especially at Republic Square (available mostly during winter).\n\nHowever, the most famous dish in Serbia is ",{"type":"'''","value":["ćevapčići"]},". Also called Ćevapi, they are a traditional food eaten throughout the Balkans. It consists of different types of minced meat (pork and beef) mixed together, shaped like small sausages, and then put on the grill. It is usually eaten with diced onion, and is very tasty. Depending on size, a portion of ćevapčići in a somun (pita bread), possibly with onion, ajvar or kajmak, is between €1.5 and €4.\n\nDo not forget to taste the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Karađorđeva Šnicla"]},".

Pickpocketers are known to operate in public transportation, and other crowded places so never wear a backpack or purse on your back and make sure that you have your wallet in one of your front pockets. If you own a car, it is preferable to have a security system. Traffic laws are usually observed although nervous drivers can change lanes suddenly or make dangerous turns when avoiding traffic during rush hour. So be cautious if you are a pedestrian or riding a bike. The taxi drivers are notorious for swerving in and out of lanes. Pay close attention to the traffic signals as a pedestrian.\n\nAlso try to avoid getting into conflicts. If you are staying out late in a bar or a club, there is always a small chance that someone will try to pick a fight especially if you are in a group and a single guy is showing hostility. That is a trap by local thugs looking for a brawl. That is not because you are a foreigner: it is just the \"law of the streets\", so anyone can be the target. Just ignore them and walk away no matter what they say or do. The chances that this will happen are very low, but stay alert.

Always carry the phone number and an address of your embassy with you.

Gay and lesbian travelers should be discreet. As a rule, public displays of affection between two people of the same sex are likely to be met with disapproval and sometimes verbal abuse and\/or physical violence. There are several gay bars and clubs all around the city and they tend to get quite full.  Be cautious when arriving at or leaving such clubs. Often there are security personnel guarding the immediate entrance. There are quite a few LGBT parties organized periodically by various organizations and at different locations, such as Loud and Queer events. Avoid football fan crowds at all costs if you think you may be a target because of your appearance which they tend to be extremely violent and homophobic. There are several LGBT organisations at your disposal in Belgrade. Find them on sites such as Queeria, Gay-Serbia.com, Labris, etc. Chatting to the LGBT community on Gayromeo.com will help to identify the main hotspots.

Most cities in Serbia and mobile operators have 2-digit area code. There is only one area code for Belgrade and that is 11. Typical land-line phone number in Belgrade +381-11\/xxx-xxxx. Typical mobile phone number is +381-6x\/xxx-xxxx. From Serbian land line phone, use 00 prefix for international calls (e.g. 0031-20\/xxx-xxxx for Amsterdam, Netherlands), and prefix 0 for calls inside Serbia but outside your area (e.g. 021\/xxx-xxxx for Novi Sad, Serbia or 06x\/xxx-xxxx for Serbian mobile). If you dial inside the same area, there is no need to use the prefix (just dial xxx-xxxx). From a mobile phone, you always have to dial the area code (011\/xxx-xxxx for Belgrade land line phone, 0xx\/xxx-xxx(x) for other Serbian land line phones or 06x\/xxx-xxxx for Serbian mobile).\n\nBasically all of Serbia is covered with mobile networks of all three operators. It is easy to buy and charge cheap pre-paid numbers at the kiosks around the city. If you use 064, 065 or 066 (MTS), pre-paid number, use *100# to check the credit, for 063, 062 and 069 (Telenor), use *121#, for 061 and 060 (Vip), use *123#.\n\nThere is a number of red-colored payphones across the city, operated by telephone cards available at the kiosks.\n\nFree wireless access is available at Student park in Belgrade center and in many restaurants, bars and hotels. Mobile operators offers pre- and post-paid wireless Internet packages.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\n\nBelgrade's climate is generally temperate, so tourist visits are possible at any time of year. However, July and August can be uncomfortably hot, with temperatures reaching 40°C on several days. Minimize your exposure to the sun on such days to avoid heat exhaustion. On the other hand, January and February are sometimes very cold. When it snows in winter, the streets are covered in sleet the next day, so be careful when walking. The ",{"type":"'''","value":["Košava"]},", a notorious Belgrade wind, may give you a cold more quickly than you would expect - take care and dress appropriately.\n\nFor runners, a sunrise or sunset run through Kalemegdan is a must-do. Running along the Ada lake in the mornings or evenings is a great experience too. Try to avoid running during the day, as it usually is both hot and very crowded.\n\nAlso be mindful of the high number of stray animals roaming streets, particularly dogs. Whilst it is very rare that they demonstrate outward signs of illness or aggression, err on the side of caution and avoid coming in physical contact. These are nevertheless rarely seen in the city center.\n\nPharmacies – called 'apoteka' – are found throughout the city center. Look for lit green crosses on building façades. Some, such as the one in Kralja Milana Str, are open twenty-four hours. These will carry a range of prescription medicines, as well as over-the-counter products like pain killers and vitamin supplements. Serbian pharmacies were known during the 1990s and early 2000s for selling without a prescription many medications which are prescription-only in Western Europe. This practice has faded significantly, but it hasn't disappeared entirely. However, the convenience stores referred to by Belgraders as 'dragstor' do not sell any medicines at all.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n\nThere are a few dozens of gyms around the city, every neighborhood has at least a few.
