It's about 14 km out of the town, and the roads are in very bad condition. Finally, in 2007, the last three dancing bear in Bulgaria have been liberated, and now lives in this park.\n\nEntry is free, the but Four Paws foundation relies on donations to survive (and hopefully to help fix up the road).\n\nThe park is closed December through March. The bears may be hibernating (some for the first time). April and May the park opens at 10AM, and closes at 6PM. June through September the park closes at 8PM, and October and November at 4PM.
