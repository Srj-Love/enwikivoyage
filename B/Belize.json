As a result, although English is the official language, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Spanish"]]}," is also often spoken. In the south east along the Caribbean coast live the Garifuna (Black Caribs), an Afro-Amerindian culture.\n\nAfter long journeys starting in what is now the Netherlands in 1790, via Germany, South Russia, Canada, the United States, and Mexico several thousand German speaking Mennonite Christians arrived in Belize in 1958 after long and detailed discussions with the government regarding specific exemptions and privileges.\n\nWorld class attractions include exploring the lush jungles with exotic plants and animals, deep sea fishing, swimming, snorkelling and diving in the Caribbean sea with its attractive reefs, and visiting the Mayan ruins.

They are still here, an important part of Belize's people and culture.  While the Spanish Empire claimed the area in the 16th century, the Spanish made little progress in settling here.  The British settled first on the coast and offshore islands for logging. In 1798 British Belizean forces defeated a Spanish attempt to drive them out in \"the Battle of St. George's Caye\", whose anniversary is still celebrated as a holiday each 10 September.\n\nThe colony of British Honduras grew in the 19th century.  At first Africans were brought in as slaves, but slavery was abolished here in 1838.  Many refugees from the 19th century Caste War of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yucatán Peninsula"],["Yucatán"]]}," escaped the conflict to settle in Belize, especially the northern section.\n\nThe government of Guatemala long claimed to have inherited the Spanish claim to Belize; the territorial dispute delayed the independence of Belize until 1981. Guatemala refused to recognize the new nation until 1991.\n\nBelize escaped the bloody civil conflicts of the 1980s that engulfed much of Central America, and refugees from the conflict in Guatemala arrived, mostly settling in the west.  While Belize has not been immune to the rampant drug crime and grinding poverty of its neighbours it is a comparatively safe destination in a conflict prone part of the world.\n\nTourism has become the mainstay of the economy as the old agricultural products—sugar, banana, and oranges—have lost ground.
