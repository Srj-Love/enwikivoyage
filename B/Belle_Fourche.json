On the right side of the road is a sign telling you that you have reached the center of the nation. On the pasture there is a US flag and a geographic survey marker that marks the center of the nation. The ranch owner allows visitors to reach this spot, but you will have to climb through a barbed wire fence and dodge cow pies and snakes to get to it.
