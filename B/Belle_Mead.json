The area was originally named Vanaken after the New York contractor who bought most of the farms in the area, split them up into roads,and tried to start a town. The town once revolved around a train station which closed in the 1940s, the structure still stands near Township Line Road and Route 206.\n\nToday Belle Mead ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.hillsborough-nj.org\/Cit-e-Access\/webpage.cfm?TID=45&TPID=6330"]}," is a widespread community  mostly consisting of residential areas, farmlands, parks, and shopping centers all sharing the zip code 08502.\nThe area is still considered a farming region, with many of these farms being protected\/preserved by Montgomery and Hillsborough Townships, however building and residential areas have been on the rise since the late 1990s.
