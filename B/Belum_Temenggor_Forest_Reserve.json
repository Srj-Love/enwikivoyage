It is believed to have been in existence for over 130 million years making it one of the world’s oldest rainforests, older than both the Amazon and the Congo.  In the heart of the forest lies a manmade lake covering 15,200 Hectares which is dotted with hundreds of islands. Belum-Temenggor is still relatively low key in regards to tourism making it easy to enjoy the tranquility of the jungle and increasing your chances of spotting wild animals. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nThe Orang Asli (Native Aborigines) were the first inhabitants of the Malay Peninsula, and many of them were traditionally nomadic or semi-nomadic. Semi-nomadic Orang Asli can be found today on the islands of Temenggor. They live in their traditional way in bamboo huts, hunting small mammals using blowpipes, fishing and gathering plants and honey from the forest.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Conservation"]},"\nAs with all of Malaysia's rainforest, government sanctioned deforestation for logging and agriculture is one of the main contributors to environmental decline in Belum-Temenggor. The Malay peninsula has lost over half of its natural forest cover since 1950. \n\nThe comparably small amount of forest left in the Malay peninsula is still being cut down by government approved logging companies. Illegal logging also persists adding to an already problematic situation. It is anticipated that, at present rates of deforestation, more than 50% of Malaysian forest species will become extinct, many of them endemic to this area. When the depleted areas are replanted it is usually with exotic commercial species in monocultures.   \n   \nThere are many NGO's and lobbing groups currently trying to educate the Malay people and influence government policies, focusing on short term gains and destroying the ecosystem is detrimental not only to our environment but to future economic development.
