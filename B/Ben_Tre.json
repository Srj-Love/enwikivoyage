Although only a 20 min ferry-ride away from bustling ",{"type":"[[","value":[["My Tho"]]},", this seems to be barrier enough to give the town a genuine backwater feeling. Tourists are still a scarce species and locals are open and friendly.\n\nBen Tre Province provides some of the most beautiful scenery in the Mekong delta. The milk coffee coloured waters wind their way along small channels lined with water palms, thatch, and bamboo houses are nestled in the lush orchards. The famous Vietnamese poet Nguyen Dinh Chieu was born in Ben Tre Province. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\n\nFerries from Rach Mieu in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["My Tho"]]}," (20 min\/24 hr) arrive some 10 km north of Ben Tre, so you might want to hire a xe om to take you to the town centre.\n\nThere is a ferry from Vinh Long Province to the northwestern part of the island. Again you may want to hire some sort of transport to cover the remaining distance to Ben Tre town. There is also Bus 8 from the ferry pier to Ben Tre. It seems frequent, costs about 25,000 dong for 2h trip. You will need a taxi (moto ~ 20,000 dong for 10 min ride). Pay attention when arriving in Ben Tre as the bus goes to the outer bus station. Best is to stop at the roundabout after the two big bridges and Mat Kinh Dien Bien Phu optic shop and take a motorbike taxi (20,000 dong) to the town centre.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nDirect minibus services from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ho Chi Minh City"]]}," are to be found at ",{"type":"''","value":["Cholon"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["Mien Tay"]}," bus station. A bridge connects the city to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["My Tho"]]}," so the bus ride is direct, without a ferry. On arrival at the bus station in Ben Tre, a very welcoming man with good English will try to get you to his guesthouse by showing books and stuff. In fact, the ride there takes you back where your bus came from, halfway to My Tho, about 10 km from Ben Tre. Make sure to get from the Ben Tre bus station into the town of Ben Tre, not elsewhere.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe town stretches along the river, so a bicycle or a motorbike are the best way to get around.\n \n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThere are no real sights in their own right, but you could have a look at the unspoiled ",{"type":"'''","value":["market"]}," or visit the ",{"type":"'''","value":["rice wine factory"]}," on the south bank, 0.5 km west of the old bridge.
