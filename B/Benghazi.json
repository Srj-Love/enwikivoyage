However, very few people speak any English and, because of the writing style, it is almost impossible to recognize any public signs. Most things can, however, be sorted out with a bit of pointing and hand waving.\n\nThe dress code is not as liberal as in Tripoli, and women should keep themselves covered - not because there would be trouble, but just out of respect. However, locals do not expect non-Muslim visitors to thoroughly comply with their customs.\n\nPeople in Tripoli like a good argument and may shout at one another, but this is not an indication of any trouble. Even if it sounds harsh to you, if you understand Arabic, you will find out it is generally nothing of any consequence.\n\nIf you travel on a tourist visa, you must get the hotel staff to have your passport stamped or visit the local police station to register where you are staying and get a stamp in your passport - otherwise, you will not find it easy to leave the country.\n\nIf you wish to drive out of the city and visit the ruins or other sites of interest, you can get a local guide, but you will need a permit from the local tourist office before you may leave the city.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nBenina Airport (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["BEN"]]},") (Arabic: مطار بنينة الدولي) is located 20 km from city centre.\n\nThe airport operations are seemingly chaotic, with handwritten boarding passes and luggage tags and very little information available.\n\nDelays are quite frequent and flights may be suspended, cancelled or delayed at any time.\n\nThe airport toilet facilities are awful, there are few, if any, public toilets, and most restaurants do not have them either, so you may have to wait until you get to the hotel or onto the aircraft.\n\n",{"type":"{|","value":[["border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\""],["|-"],["!style=\"background-color: #c5d9f4;\"|Airlines"],["!style=\"background-color: #c5d9f4;\"|Destinations"],["!style=\"background-color: #c5d9f4;\"|Terminal"],["|-"],["! style=\"background-color: #eeead3;\" | [Afriqiyah Airways]"],["| style=\"background-color: #f5f5f5;\"| Tripoli, Misrata || style=\"background-color: #f0e8e3;\"|Domestic"],["|-"],["! style=\"background-color: #eeead3;\" | [EgyptAir]"],["| style=\"background-color: #f5f5f5;\"| Cairo || style=\"background-color: #ebf2e2;\"|International"],["|-"],["! style=\"background-color: #eeead3;\" | [Libyan Airlines]"],["| style=\"background-color: #f5f5f5;\"| Alexandria, Cairo, Tunis [all ops uncertain] || style=\"background-color: #ebf2e2;\"|International"],["|-"],["! style=\"background-color: #eeead3;\" | [Libyan Airlines]"],["| style=\"background-color: #f5f5f5;\"|Tripoli| [all ops uncertain] || style=\"background-color: #f0e8e3;\"|Domestic"],["|-"],["! style=\"background-color: #eeead3;\" | [Qatar Airways]"],["| style=\"background-color: #f5f5f5;\"| Doha|| style=\"background-color: #ebf2e2;\"|International"],["|-"],["! style=\"background-color: #eeead3;\" | [Royal Jordanian]"],["| style=\"background-color: #f5f5f5;\"| Amman-Queen Alia || style=\"background-color: #ebf2e2;\"|International"],["|-"],["! style=\"background-color: #eeead3;\" | [Tunisair]"],["| style=\"background-color: #f5f5f5;\"| Tunis || style=\"background-color: #ebf2e2;\"|International"],["|-"],["! style=\"background-color: #eeead3;\" | [Turkish Airlines]"],["| style=\"background-color: #f5f5f5;\"| Istanbul-Ataturk || style=\"background-color: #ebf2e2;\"|International"],["|-"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Taxis"]},"\n\nTaxis in Libya are interesting. They are either minibuses that travel round a predefined route or black and white cars (dead pandas) with taxi signs. Stick with the cars... Taxi travel is very cheap, but the vehicles are generally in a bad state of repair. Try to sit in the back as the journeys can be somewhat exciting when in the passenger seat, when drivers tend to turn across traffic lanes. Judging by the number of dents on the sides of the cars, the drivers do not always make this maneuver successfully.\n\nTaxi vehicles often lack parts that Westerners tend to take for granted -- such as indicators, headlights, bumpers, working brakes and wheel nuts.\n\nThe taxi drivers are like most European taxi drivers. They enjoy sharing their opinions with you, even if you can't understand them - but, as with most of the people in Benghazi, they are friendly, and they do try to make you feel welcome.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Benghazi Cathedral"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat=32.113889"],["long=20.059444"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Construteced during the 1930s in a neo-classical style, the Benghazi Cathedral used to the one of the largest churches in whole of North Africa.

So, it's easy to get a fridge, an aircon unit, a mobile phone, Mars bars, or Coke, but very little to buy as a souvenir. A sheesh?

Although very basic by western standards, they do produce good meals. Round the back of the Tibesti Hotel there are some good Turkish restaurants; most of their food is very edible, and the prices are very reasonable.\n\nGenerally, service is very slow, so leave a good amount of time to have a meal. There are kebab takeaways if you are in a hurry, but in a hotel you can wait 30 minutes to get a waiter to take your order or bring you a menu. To save time it is often easier to pay for your meal\/drinks as they are served, before saving the half-hour wait to get a bill.\n\nThe food is generally served a little cooler than you expect - it is generally warm rather than hot, and the chips are worth avoiding as they tend to be rubbery.\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nAlcohol is not allowed in Libya. The best things to drink are:\n\nCoffee, although they do seem to want to give you Nescafe, as they think it's pretty cool; but just about everywhere you can get cappuccino or Arabian coffee, which are pretty good.\n\nThe mango juice is good and very thick.\n\nCoke, Lilt, and 7Up cans are popular, as well as the lemon and mint teas.\n\nAlcohol-free beer is widely available (Becks), as is 'Spitz', which tastes like campari or cough mixture. If you really want alcohol, wine is available from butcher's shops, but it's expensive (whisky is about USD 100 per bottle).

The \"no smoking\" signs in airports appear to be a guidance note rather than a command.\n\nHand-rolling tobacco is not available, but normal cigarettes are widely available and quite cheap, although slightly different than their western counterparts.\n\nDuty free is somewhat limited, so it is best to buy on the way out rather than on the return journey; this obviously, does not apply to alcohol.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nStandards of maintenance are not always perfect and service can be slow, the rating system does not really correspond to international guidelines.
