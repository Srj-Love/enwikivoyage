It has a large Spanish population as well as a large retired British population. Benidorm was built compact thanks to the foresight of the town's mayor who in the 1960s saw a vision of a resort which grew upwards. Now it is slowly spreading westwards. Today Benidorm is famous for tall hotels and holiday apartment blocks, some of which are over 25 floors high. Since 2006 Benidorm has also seen a huge increase in the quality of accommodation and now attracts not just package holiday visitors but tourists who demand 5-star hotel and spa complexes. Due to the July–August crowd of young people, many apartments will insist on a refundable deposit for certain times of the year.\n\nTree lined wide avenues give a feeling of space where there are over 1,000 places to eat and drink and watch the town in full swing.  The streets offer a very vibrant atmosphere day and night with something to offer visitors of any age group. There are over 41,000 hotel beds and modern tourist apartments.  The biggest assets are the 4 km of Blue Flag** safe sandy beaches which draw people from all over Spain in Summer months and from all over Europe 365 days of the year.  Benidorm is an ideal sun destination both in Summer and Winter due to the mild climate where day time temperatures rarely fall below 18c.

Breakfast is a favourite of many with an ample fried breakfast starting from two euros.\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=La Traviata"],["url="],["email="],["address=Avenida de Madrid, 4"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Playa Levante"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Great Italian food.

The old town is preferred by couples and more mature visitors offering a less frantic holiday. The Poniente is ideal for beach holidays and peace and quiet.

When someone asked about \"Muggers Alley\", two different locations were given. Be careful in crowds, notably the Sunday-Wednesday market which has general things which you can buy as cheap elsewhere and the Sunday bootsale market which has older things and collectibles. Valuables should not be left in (empty) cars or apartments. Lock all doors and windows when leaving your apartment. Most rooms will come with a safe.\n\nDespite these warnings visitors should remember that at peak times Benidorm hosts up to 200,000 people, therefore the true crime numbers are actually quite small. Sadly crimes are talked about around the many bars and tend to be exaggerated somewhat. In reality Benidorm is as safe as any other busy tourist resort where the majority of petty crime takes place late at night and usually involves alcohol fueled crimes. The police have a very visible presence, in cars.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nThe towns nearby are worth a visit. Altea is a quiet up-market town with a lot more Spanish Culture and a stunning original old town which is well preserved. It also has a weekly outdoor market. Guadalest is a village that also deserves to be visited, many of the houses here are over 400 years old and there are spectacular views of the mountains.  For a great day out the city of Valencia is a must which you can reach by express coach in 90 minutes from Benidorm.\n\nIf you hire a car you will also find the entire region is a hive of small villages and picturesque mountains. A recommended route to see the real Spain is to head toward Finestrat just 9 km from Benidorm and drive from there into the mountains where you will find a different world.  For wine lovers head toward Calpe (30 minutes drive) and take the signs for Jalon where you will find the wine growing region and almond groves.\n\nThe Algar waterfalls near Polop are a lovely place to escape the hustle and bustle of busy Benidorm but go on a nice day in summer.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Alicante (province)"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Geo"],["38.534167"],["-0.131389"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Benidorm"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Europe\/Spain\/Autonomous Communities\/Valencian Community\/Alicante\/Benidorm\/"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Benidorm"]]}]
