There is plenty to do and see while in Bentonville. Tourism is the area is booming, thanks to the corporate traveler during the week and families on the weekends. If you are looking for things to do while in town, visit the local Chamber of Commerce's website, or stop by the Bentonville Convention & Visitors Bureau, located on the Bentonville square. \n\nBecause the majority of the population are \"transplants\" from other areas of the country (moved here for business), people are open to visitors and very friendly.
