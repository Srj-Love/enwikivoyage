Anyway, there is taxi trans like Paradep Taxi or send email add: tobatransporter@hotmail.com or mobile phone +6285261492668 who will arranged your transportation as well as appointment its take.\n\nSince July 25, 2013 all flights are serve from new airport Kualanamu International Airport which has airport train to Medan, airport buses to Medan, Binjai, Pematangsiantar and Kabanjahe. Bus ticket to Kabanjahe, the capital city of Karo Regency, 11 kilometer from Berastagi is Rp.60,000 ($4.8). All buses from airport is good and convinience, so if you don't need to visit Medan, you can go directly to Berastagi. Please see Wikipedia: Kuala Namu International Airport https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kuala_Namu_International_Airport#Ground_transportation\n\nJuly 2012:\nIt is possible to go from Medan to Berastagi of from Parapat (Lake Toba) to Berastagi by tourist bus . This means a minivan for 5-7 persons, prices per person. This is more expensive than by local bus but easy and convenient and it is much cheaper than a taxi.\n\nA traditional local bus from Medan to Berastagi (10.000 rp\/person; approx. 2 hours) leaves every 15 or 20 minutes from Sutra Bus Station in Padang Bulan (ca. 30 minutes from Medan city centre). You can get to the bus station by public transport or by taxi (Blue Bird is on the metre; costs between 40.000-50.000 rp).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nBuses service many of the surrounding villages as is the case in the rest of Indonesia.  Prices are similar to those elsewhere in Indonesia. You may get to ride on the roof of local minibuses. Many run along the main road all the time. Central market is main stop.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nSibayak, Sinabung mountains, Sipiso-piso Falls, Traditional Karonese House at Lingga Village, Lake Toba (Tongging).\n\nThe tourist info is very helpful. However, booking trips is cheaper with local agencies, for example Losmen Sibayak Guesthouse (in the centre, next to BRI bank).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nA climb of Gunung Sibayak is a must.  A guide is definitely required unless you are an experienced trekker as the path is very slippery, steep and confusing in some areas. Sometimes the path branches out into 2 paths and an experienced guide will definitely know which path leads to which active spot. The guides will also probably know many alternative paths to the top depending on the weather and your fitness level or time. Catch a bus to the bus terminal at the bottom of the mountain.  If short on time you could get dropped off up higher as the lower part is road and not as scenic. Ask your hotel which bus (some leave from the flower market).  The walk starts off by ascending sharply and really doesn't stop climbing until you reach the 2000m summit.  It is a tough walk and water and snacks are a must, but those with a basic level of fitness should be able to complete this with rests along the way.  Three hours from start to summit.  The road is paved the entire way up and it is impossible to get lost on the way up.please book a guide mobile 085297589379\n\nThe crater of Gunung Sibayak is filled with rocks that tourists have inevitably made into all sorts of shapes and words.  From here, a good way to descend the mountain is to head off over the far side of the crater (3 o clock) down some ",{"type":"'''","value":["very"]}," slippery surfaces. Beware though, there are some who have ended up getting seriously lost. In particular, avoid the trail that heads behind the antenna hill; you want to be heading down the opposite direction. Be extra cautious in foggy weather. Alternatively walk back the same way you came and about 45 minutes from the summit a road veers off to the right. This will bring you to Semangat Gunung, the hot springs village.\nFrom here, transport back to Berastagi is as easy as jumping on the first bus seen, last one around 6PM. Watching the sun set over the volcano you just climbed from the roof of the bus is magic.\n\nYou can also go to Gunung Sinabung, the easiest way is to take a minibus to Danau Kawar (a lake at the foot of the volcano) and then hike up (you should ask for directions as the beginning is not obvious). After the initial pass through the farms the path is impossible to miss (although the usual stories about lost\/dead tourists exist and are listed at the tourist information office in Berestagi), so no guide should be necessary. Good views from the top and excellent walk through the jungle (the walk up to Sibayak is not quite so pleasant).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\nTry betelnuts from the market.
