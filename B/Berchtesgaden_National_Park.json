In the 18th century the summer and hunting palace was rebuilt, with older building sections incorporated. After Berchtesgaden became part of Bavaria in 1810, the palace became a hunting lodge for the Bavarian kings and was one of their favourite haunts. Since the Romantic period, the world-famous pilgrimage church, set against the Watzmann range, has been a source of inspiration for numerous landscape painters."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Fischerstüberl"],["url=http:\/\/www.fischervomkoenigssee.de"],["email="],["address=St. Bartholomä 3"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone =+49  8652 3119"],["tollfree="],["fax=+49 (0)8652 69333"],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Gaststätte Sankt Bartholomä"],["url=http:\/\/www.sankt-bartholomae.de"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone =+49  86 52 964937"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Open when ferries are running on lake Königsee"],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Lodging"]},"\nInns, summer flats and other types of countryside accommodation are abundant in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Berchtesgaden"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Schönau"]]},".\n",{"type":"===","value":["Camping"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Back Country"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinepark"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["47.5333"],["12.9167"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Upper Bavaria"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Berchtesgaden National Park"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Nationalpark Berchtesgaden"]]}]
