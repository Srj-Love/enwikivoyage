Having fostered many of Norway's greatest bands and artists, the city is also famous for its cultural life and underground\/indie music scene. Bergen's unpredictable weather adds to its quirky, unmistakeable charm. Bergen was Norway's main city for centuries, and many patritotic inhabitants believe it still is.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nFounded around 1070 AD, Bergen quickly evolved into one of the most important cities in Norway. It was the country's administrative capital from the early 1200s until 1299, and the largest city in Scandinavia.  Bergen was one of the most important bureau cities of the Hanseatic League, interconnecting continental Europe with the northern and coastal parts of Norway, thus becoming a central spot for the vending of stockfish and the commercial hot spot in Norway. It was the largest city in Norway until the 1830s and has a long maritime history in shipping and finance.\n\nThe city still has relics of its Hanseatic heyday, most notably the old harbor of Bryggen, a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["UNESCO World Heritage Site"]]},". Bergen has been ravaged by several fires; the most recent major fire took place in 1917, a fire which destroyed most of the buildings in what is today the central parts of the city center, centered around the large square Torgallmenningen.\n\nWhile few mediveal buildings remain, the historical centre of Bergen is along the eastern shore of the harbour, notably Bryggen (the Wharf), the fortress and the two key churches (Mariakirken\/St Marys and Korskirken\/Holy cross church). The pattern of settlement is largely unchanged for almost 1,000 years, including Øvregaten\/Lille Øvregate − one of Norway's oldest streets.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Geography"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Houses in Bergen Norway 2009 2.jpg"],["thumb"],["White wooden houses, one of Bergen's trademarks"]]}," \nBergen is located far west in Norway, sheltered from the North Sea only by a number of islands.

The city is the most hilly and mountainous in Norway. The city center is surrounded by a group of mountains and peaks known as the Seven Mountains, a defining characteristic which has given the city its name (berg is an old Norse word for mountain). The geographic conditions of the city are very visible; limited space to build on made it necessary in the 19th century that new city blocks be built on the steep slopes of mount Fløyen\n\nExcept for the dense city center, which made up the entire city before 1916, Bergen is the least dense of the four largest cities in Norway. Most of the settlement inside the very wide city borders is concentrated in the western part of the municipality. The rest of the municipality is made up of mountains, as well as some farmland and smaller settlements.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh =   4"],["febhigh =   4"],["marhigh =   6"],["aprhigh =  10"],["mayhigh =  13"],["junhigh =  16"],["julhigh =  18"],["aughigh =  18"],["sephigh =  15"],["octhigh =  11"],["novhigh =   7"],["dechigh =   5"],["janlow =   2"],["feblow =   1"],["marlow =   2"],["aprlow =   5"],["maylow =   8"],["junlow =  11"],["jullow =  13"],["auglow =  13"],["seplow =  11"],["octlow =   7"],["novlow =   4"],["declow =   2"],["janprecip = 190"],["febprecip = 152"],["marprecip = 170"],["aprprecip = 114"],["mayprecip = 106"],["junprecip = 132"],["julprecip = 148"],["augprecip = 190"],["sepprecip = 283"],["octprecip = 271"],["novprecip = 259"],["decprecip = 235"],["description ="],["description = The best site for weather forecasts in English is yr.no ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.yr.no\/place\/Norway\/Hordaland\/Bergen\/Bergen\/"]}]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:U+2602.svg"],["thumb"],["100px"],["left"],["Most useful accessory in Bergen."]]},"\nDue to the city's location relatively far north, close to the northern sea and surrounded by mountains, special weather conditions occur, resulting in approximately 240 days with precipitation a year and a mean temperature of 7.6 °C (45.7 °F). In January 2007, a record of 85 rainy days in a row was set. Still, local people claim there is no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothing. An annual mean at close to 8 °C, with even January on average above 0 °C, makes Bergen the warmest city in Norway. Frost just below 0°C and some snow occurs between December and February, but temperatures colder than -10 °C are very rare. Temperatures above 30 °C are also extremely rare.\n\nFor the rest of us, the trick is obviously to choose the time of visit with caution. The infamous rain should not keep visitors away in summer, because when the sun breaks through after a rainy day, hardly any city twinkles and glows like Bergen. If you catch the city on a sunny day, you will find an incredible atmosphere as citizens really know how to appreciate nice weather. City planners have probably had this in mind the latest years, resulting in the creation of open spaces, parks, flowers and lawns that are scattered all over downtown.\n\nJuly has the highest mean temperature, 14.3 °C (57.7 °F), with August, 14.1 °C (57.4 °F) following close behind. May is usually the month with the least precipitation. Considering the number of local events this month, May is probably the best time to visit Bergen, with the summer months of June, July and August almost as good. April is also a relatively dry month, although cooler than the summer months. These averages are merely indications as weather is famously unpredictable and rain does not appear in any regular pattern.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Culture"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Grieghallen.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Grieghallen - the home of the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra."]]},"\nBergen is one of the most important cultural centers in Norway.

The local symphony orchestra, Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra, was founded in 1786. It is one of the world's oldest orchestral institutions. Bergen was the home of Norway's great composer, Edvard Grieg. Henrik Ibsen, the famous playwright, started his career in Bergen as manager of Den Nationale Scene.\n\nAround 2000, a number of artists from the rhythmic music scene in Bergen gained international fame. In the domestic press, this became known as the Bergen Wave. Musicians and bands with roots in Bergen include Annie, Burzum, Enslaved, Gorgoroth, Immortal, Erlend Øye, Kings of Convenience, Röyksopp, Sondre Lerche, and Datarock. Bergen still has a thriving underground\/indie music scene.\n\nIn recent years, a number of great international artists have visited Bergen, including Bob Dylan, The Rolling Stones, Metallica, Iron Maiden, Foo Fighters, Coldplay, Muse, Bruce Springsteen, Depeche Mode, Kent and Mark Knopfler. And in the summer of 2011 several artists including Roxette, Mastodon, Avenged Sevenfold, Suzanne Vega, Bob Dylan, Kaizers Orchestra, Kanye West and Rihanna appeared.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["style"],["All ",{"type":"[[","value":[["external links"]]}," in the deprecated footnote style must be front-linked"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.avinor.no\/en\/airport\/bergen Bergen Airport Flesland"]}]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["BGO"]]},") is located 19 km south of the city.

Even if some people drive very fast, you should mind the speed limits (usually 80 km\/h) and drive according to the conditions. In the mountains, help can be hours away. Furthermore, you will find traffic controls and police in unmarked cars nearly everywhere. Fines are very high. Do also keep in mind that to avoid dangerous situations, it's a very good idea stop and let faster going traffic pass you. Except in and around Bergen, traffic is generally very light, although there may be some traffic on road 7 during summer vacation and around weekends.\n\nRoad E16 from Oslo and Voss makes a circle from Arna through Aasane where it joins E39 on a motorway to the centre (northern approach). At Sandviken the wide road continues through a long tunnel towards the southern city in order to avoid the centre, while those heading for the centre can either exit at Sandviken or just after the tunnel.

It might be a good idea to use two days on the tour in the winter if you're not accustomed to these conditions. A 12 or even 14 hour drive on icy, dark roads in bad weather is not very nice.

When you purchase a ticket from the driver, you will find the time of validity printed on it. Within the time of validity you may change buses or from bus to light rail once as long as you do it at the most natural point of interchange.

During the school vacation (mid-June to mid-August), buses are less frequent, so make sure you have an updated bus schedule. On Christmas Eve (December 24), there are no buses after about 4PM. On Constitution Day (May 17), the parades and celebrations shut down the downtown streets, though buses do run to and from downtown, they will generally not run through downtown on that day.\n\nAfter about 1AM, regular bus services cease to run. In the weekends, there are a few night bus lines available. Tickets are more expensive than on the regular lines (kr. 60 within city limits), and travel passes can not be used.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Accessibilty"]},"\n\nThe process of replacing old buses with newer ones accessible for people using wheelchairs is ongoing. Most buses on central lines have low floors and a built-in ramp. On the new buses, that are now a majority, the stops are announced on a display.

This is the primary means of public transportation to southern parts of Bergen. The line passes the railway station, the bus station, Brann soccer stadium and the student homes at Fantoft along the route. The line operates from 6AM to 1AM, seven days a week, generally with a 10-minute frequency (a bit more often during rush hours, 15-minute frequency on Saturday mornings, 30-minute frequency on Sunday mornings). The entire journey takes about 25 minutes.\n\nNight lines operate all Friday and Saturday night with departures every 30 minutes.\n\nYou need to buy your ticket from the ticket machine at the station before you board. Apart from that, the ticket and fare card system is the same as for buses, see the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bergen#By bus 2"],["Get around by bus"]]}," section for more details. It's possible to change from bus to light rail and from light rail to bus within the time of validity of a ticket. Tickets for the night lines must be bought on board. Fare cards can not be used. The price is 60 kr.\n\nThe light rail is accessible with a wheelchair. All stops are announced and displays also show the name of the next stop.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nIt is an expressed goal of both local and national authorities to reduce car traffic in the city center. Thus, the speed limit downtown is very low, and most streets are one-way streets. If you plan on getting from one part of downtown to another, walking is often faster then driving, even for locals who know their way around. Furthermore, parking in the streets is reserved for the handicapped and for residents with a special permit with only a very few exceptions. If you plan to drive to the city center from outside of it, unless you have any special needs, park your car in a garage, such as Bygarasjen (very large, at the bus station) and Klostergarasjen (at Nøstet, northern downtown), Bygarasjen being the cheaper. There are also several smaller (and more expensive) garages around town. If you take the chance to bring your car further downtown, be sure to read all signs – most streets are one-way streets and some are for buses and taxis only.\n\nTo park in a spot reserved for the disabled, you need a standard European \"blue badge\", a special parking permit (generally, handicapped parking permits from most countries will be accepted). It must be placed on the inside of your car's front window, clearly visible from the outside.\n\nThe municipal parking authorities provide a ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.tjenestekatalog.no\/vis\/22381736\/Parkeringskart%202012.pdf brochure"]}," with some information on the general rules of parking along with a map of parking spots, including parking spots for the disabled.\n\nDriving in the area outside the city center is quite convenient, with expressways going in most directions. The roads are well sign-posted, but a map will probably come in handy anyway. Mind the speed limits; traffic controls are common and fines are stiff. Do also keep in mind that a lot of the roads are toll roads. All toll stations are automated. When approaching one, keep driving and do not slow down. A photograph of your license plates will be taken, and you will receive an invoice per mail. During rush hours (7:30AM-9AM and 3PM-5PM) traffic is jammed many places, but it's nothing compared to larger cities in Europe.\n\nBetween 1 November and 31 March, the use of studded tires is legal. Within Bergen municipality, you have to pay a fee to use such tires. You can pay at automated payment stations on the main roads into Bergen (Norwegian: ",{"type":"''","value":["oblatautomat"]},"), Statoil gas stations or by visiting the municipal parking authorities in Bygarasjen or Vincens Lunges gate 3 (directly south of the railway station).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\n\nTaxis are generally expensive in Norway. Throughout Bergen, there are a number of taxi stalls where taxis are parked waiting for customers. During the day, taxis will usually not pick up customers nearer than 300 metres from the stalls, except when called to an address. During the night in the weekends, taxi queues can be very long (up to one hour), and all customers are therefore required to go to the stalls. It is possible to order taxis to addresses also at this time of the week, but you shouldn't really expect the taxi to arrive.\n\nThe places where the taxis are stationed changes from time to time because of renovation of the city streets, but usually you will find them at the bus station, the railway station, Festplassen, Ole Bulls plass, Torget and in Torggaten and Vetrlidsalmenning. Look for signs saying \"Taxi\". Some taxi stalls are only open during the night, and vice versa. Information about this is printed on a separate sign below the taxi sign. If no taxis are available at the taxi stall, call 07000 (Bergen Taxi), 08000 (Norgestaxi), +47 55 70 00 00 (Taxi 1) or +47 55 70 80 90 (Bryggen Taxi). Note that there is usually a fee associated with calling a taxi. Taxis may also be ordered in advance by calling one of these numbers, which is recommended if you have the possibility.\n\nFares are approximately the same regardless of the taxi company. All companies are regarded as reliable and safe. If several taxis are available at a taxi station, you may pick the one you want from the line.\n\nIt can be added that taxi drivers rarely expect or receive any tip.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\nThere is one local commuter train service, between downtown Bergen and the suburb of Arna in the east (schedules are available from the ",{"type":"[","value":["https:\/\/www.nsb.no\/en\/3642\/Download+timetables Norwegian State Railways' web site"]},").

It is used today for royal galas, as a banqueting hall for the city council, and other public events. The roof is reconstructed after a blast during World War II.

It was expanded in the 1560s by the governor, Erik Rosenkrantz, to its present shape. The rest of the medieval buildings in the fortress have been replaced or demolished over the centuries, with some ruins still visible. Among these is the medieval cathedral, the Church of Christ, which was used for coronation and as a royal burial site in the 13th century. A memorial marks the site of the high altar.

Night clubs are usually open from 11PM, but life never starts before 1AM. Bars opens at different hours, some can be open all day. No places are allowed to serve alcohol after 3AM, and the consumption of alcoholic beverages must cease at 3:30AM at the latest. Many places are required to close earlier. The establishments are only allowed to let people bring their drinks outside if they have been granted a special permit. A requirement to get this permit is that they have a confined space outdoors for their guests. All drinks must be indoors by 1AM. People go out all week, but Fridays and Saturdays are the best nights, Saturdays being the clear winner (most places will be a bit too crowded on Saturdays). Some clubs have a 2 for 1 policy on Wednesdays, and Sunday is usually the night for people in the industry.\n\nMost places require that you are 20 years of age (look in the list for details) and that you can provide a valid ID, even if you are much older. Valid IDs are Norwegian bank cards, European standard driver's licenses and ID cards and passports. Drinking in public is illegal. Emptying a can in front of a police officer on a Saturday night will earn you a kr. 2500 fine. If you stroll through a park a bit outside the city center on a sunny day you will still see a lot of people having a beer or a glass of wine with the picnic. The police usually won't mind as long as everything passes in an orderly fashion.\n\nPrices vary great from place to place, ask at the door if you need to know. In the weekends, there is usually a cover charge from kr. 50 to kr. 100 at night clubs.\n\nAlmost all night clubs and some bars have a dress code. The required attire varies; look in the list for more information (when the listing indicates \"no dress code\" normal, nice clothes are accepted). Supporter gear is generally not accepted even in sports pubs.\n\nRemember that smoking in all indoor areas where people work is strictly prohibited by law in Norway. Most restaurants, bars, night clubs etc. will require you to leave if you try to smoke indoors.\n\nNightlife is largely concentrated in the central downtown (streets Vaskerelven, Engen, Torgallmenningen, Ole Bulls plass, Nygaardsgaten) and Bryggen area (streets Bryggen, Rosenkrantz gt, Vetrlidsallmenningen, kong Oscar gate).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Central downtown"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Clubs"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["drink"],["name=Calibar"],["url=http:\/\/www.calibar.no\/"],["email="],["address=Vaskerelven 1"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=between the theatre and the university area"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=M-Th 3PM-1AM, F 3AM-3PM, Sa noon-3PM, Su 6PM-1AM"],["price=Kr. 59 for 0.4 litres draft beers"],["content=A fancy café during the day, a hot bar\/night club at night.

It is always a good idea to look after your belongings, this includes never leaving valuable objects visual in your car and locking your bike safely.\n\nThere are no particular unsafe areas in Bergen. The upper part of Nygårdsparken is, however, the hang-out place for drug addicts. They are usually completely harmless, but nevertheless not fun to be around. The risk of getting into trouble is very low, but families should be aware of the area. The lower part of Nygårdsparken is a beautiful place popular among the locals, but the upper part is, as previously stated, somewhat of a free haven for all the drug addicts in Bergen. The drug trafficking is out in the open, addicts are shooting up in plain sight, and the police is basically turning a blind eye to the whole area. Although considered harmless by most, there are frequent petty crimes in this area and it should be avoided by tourists.\n\nUntil 2009, prostitutes would solicit their services rather openly in the area around Nykirken, the northern parts of Strandgaten and C.

This has had an effect on the visible prostitution.\n\nPeople party hard on Friday and Saturday night, and hoards of drunk people will appear in the central areas from around midnight, singing, carousing, and just hanging around.

You will also find that most shops don't handle change manually. A grey machine by the till accepts your change in the top (and counts it for the shop assistant) and provides your change in a hopper at the bottom. Don't feed a large number of coins in at once: put them in one at a time or the machine may jam.\n\nThe regular opening hours for grocery stores are 8AM-9PM on weekdays. Some stores open earlier and close later. Other shops usually have shorter hours, except those in the shopping centers. Almost all shops, including grocery stores, close earlier on Saturdays and are closed on Sundays and public holidays. Kiosks such as Narvesen, 7-Eleven and Deli de Luca, as well as many petrol stations, are open. These do however often have very high prices for normal grocery items.\n\nThere are some smaller grocery stores open on Sundays and public holidays. This includes Bunnpris at Nedre Korskirkeallmenningen (by the Bergen YMCA and the Church of the Cross) and Rimi at Nygårdsgaten 6.\n\nThe city's main post office is conveniently located in the Xhibition shopping center, on the 1st floor. Some grocery stores offers limited postal services, and stamps are available from most book stores and kiosks. Post boxes are either red or yellow and are located all over town. Yellow boxes are only for local mail, if unsure use the red box. All post boxes, post offices and grocery stores offering postal services are marked with the emblem of the Norwegian postal service, a stylized red or silver horn, and the word \"Posten\". For more information on the postal service and to locate post offices and post boxes, see the web site of Norway Post ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.posten.no\/en\/Home"]},".\n\nThe local tap water is fresh, tasty and rich in minerals from the surrounding mountains, and safe to drink.\n\nPublic toilets are available for a small fee at shopping centres and at Torget and Bryggen.\n\nA number of countries have consulates in Bergen. For a full list of embassies and consulates in Norway, see the web site of the department of foreign affairs ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.regjeringen.no\/upload\/UD\/Vedlegg\/Protokoll\/Konsullisten160610.pdf"]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\nArea codes are no longer in use in Norwegian phone numbers. Phone numbers are normally eight digits, some special numbers may be three, four or five digits. In any case you should always dial all of the digits to make a call. The country code of Norway is 47. If you are calling abroad from a land line, dial 00 before your country code and phone number.\n\nCellular phone coverage is very good throughout the city. Three different networks are available, Telenor, NetCom and Network Norway. Check with your local operator to find out which one is the cheaper for you. The difference is usually not big. Norway, like most of Europe, uses GSM 900 and 1800, which means that some cell phones from USA, Canada and countries in Asia will not work. For those in need of mobile data lines, both HSDPA\/3G\/UMTS, EDGE and GPRS coverage is good on all networks.\n\nThere are no telephone centers in the city, and only a very few phone booths. Most hotels have phones in every room, but international calls from these phones are usually very expensive. There are some calling cards available, this is probably the cheapest way to phone home.\n\nMany cafes and restaurants have free Wi-Fi for their patrons. Free Wi-Fi is also available at Bergen Public Library, Strømgaten 6 (by the bus station). Most large hotels do also have wireless Internet access, however access at a hotel may be pricy.\n\nIf you are a registered user at an eduroam ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.eduroam.org\/"]}," participating institution, you can connect to a high-speed secure Wi-Fi network on the university campus on Nygårdshøyden, as well as in other buildings used by the university, the Bergen University College, The Norwegian School of Business and Economics and the Bergen National Academy of the Arts.
