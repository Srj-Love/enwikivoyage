The forest was originally planted in the 19th century - not for tourists, but to prevent the dunes burying the villages. The reserve covers 1900 hectares, accessible on foot and by bike at several points. There is also a visitors centre, Bezoekerscentrum Het Zandspoor, Oorsprongweg 1, 1871 HA Schoorl, with a 'play forest' for children. Access to this reserve is free. However, the dunes and forest nearest Bergen are controlled by the Provincial Water Company PWN, the reserve is called the 'Noordhollands Duinreservaat'. Here you need a day ticket, € 1,20 from machines at the main entrances. The PWN reserve is cut by the road to Bergen aan Zee: the Schoorlse Duinen reserve is wilder and more forested.\n\nThere are three villages called Egmond. The oldest is Inner or Inland Egmond, Egmond-Binnen, the site of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Abbey of Egmond"]},", the oldest in the Netherlands. The present abbey is a modern re-foundation, only its location is authentic. The original abbey was founded around 950 by Dirk I, the first (perhaps second) Count of Holland. It was originally a nunnery: Count Dirk II replaced the nuns by monks. The abbey became a cultural and religious centre for the County of Holland, in the early Middle Ages. The fishing village of Egmond aan Zee was founded in 977, and was later controlled by the abbey. The (Catholic) abbey was destroyed during the (Protestant) Dutch Revolt, by the troops of Diederik Sonoy. The ruins survived until about 1800.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The present ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.abdijvanegmond.nl\/abdije.html Benedictine abbey"]}]}," was built in the mid-1930s, another religious building (partly) designed by the traditionalist architect Kropholler.
