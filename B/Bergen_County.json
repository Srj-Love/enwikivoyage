is one of the four original counties in New Jersey. Before New Jersey was what it is today, its earlier borders extended to what are currently Passaic and Hudson county. Bergen County is 239-square-miles of land in the northeast corner of the state, and its population is just over 900,000 people. Bergen County is also commonly known as being #16 out of the top 20 wealthiest counties in America, behind New York as #2, Westchester as #7, and San Francisco as #10 (http:\/\/money.aol.com\/article\/50-municipalities-with-highest-per\/490738).\n\nThe #1 reason home buyers with children move to Bergen County is the quality of our schools.\nMany of our schools are nationally recognized for their excellence. \nOur  students consistently attain the highest levels of achievement on national tests and in admission to elite colleges and universities.\nIn Bergen County, New Jersey, you will find innovative special programs, outstanding resources and facilities, and a strong community commitment to providing the highest quality education. \n\nImagine living a stone's throw from one of the world's great cities yet only an hour's drive from mountains, forests and beautiful beaches.  \nBergen County New Jersey is ideally situated to offer the best of all worlds.  \nEnjoy the unsurpassed cultural and employment opportunities of nearby New York City and the breathtaking natural wonders and recreational opportunities of the great outdoors. \n\nWhether you are going for a day trip or a family vacation, there are many places to explore in and around Bergen County.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nTo get to Bergen County, you can take many different means of transportation. If you're flying, you can fly into Newark International Airport for commercial flights and Teterboro Airport for private flights. If flying into New York makes you happier, you can fly into La Guardia Airport or John F. Kennedy International Airport. Each of these airports are within 40 minutes from Bergen County. \n\nIf you're coming from somewhere closer and you'd like to drive it's all very simple. \n\nAnywhere south, get onto the Garden State Parkway North — any of the exits between 160 and 172 will be able to take you to Bergen County. There are some other highways that can also take you there, but this is the most direct and least confusing way. \n\nIf you're coming from the north, like NYC, Mass., CT, etc...you can take the George Washington Bridge (NJ\/NY lingo \"the GW\") or the Tappan Zee Bridge. For the GW, follow signs coming off the bridge for Rt. 4 E, then for Rt. 17 N, then signs for the Garden State Parkway N. If you're taking the Tappan Zee, when you get off, follow signs for I-287 W, then take the 14A exit towards New Jersey. After that, merge onto the NY State Thruway\nNEW YORK STATE THRUWAY S and take the School House Rd. exit which will lead you into Montvale in Bergen County.\n\nThere are also lot's of great hotels to stay in that are all over BC. Depending on your price range, there are plenty of Holiday Inns to stay at or you can check-in to a Hilton or Mariott. \n\nThere are Holiday Inn Express's in Ramsey and Paramus and a Hilton and Mariott in Woodcliff Lake. Because BC is so small, no matter where you stay, everything is within a half hour of where ever you'll be.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nThe absolute best way to get around Bergen County is to drive. There are lots of places to rent cars for a weekend, because otherwise you're stuck taking public transportation which only takes you to \"working\" parts of the area, not the fun parts. You can arrange for a car service to pick you up at any of the airports and bring to you the nearest car rental agency to get your car on-the-spot or the airport will have a number of car rental services on it's property.\n\nEnterprise Rent-A-Car\nNEWARK INTL AIRPORT\n162 US HIGHWAY 1 AND 9\nNEWARK, NJ 07114-2200\nTel.: (973) 242-3400 \n\nAt La Guardia:\nAvis\n973 961-4300\n800 230-4898\n\nHertz\n973 621-2000\n800 654-3131\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\nNew Jersey is known for many things.

Paramus has even stricter blue laws that ban all work on Sunday except in groceries, restaurants, and entertainment venues. The ban on Sunday shopping is actually a state law that can be rejected on a county-by-county basis by voter referendum; Bergen County is the only county that has refused to reject the state blue law.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["Brazilian Bbq Buffet"]},"\n\nSushi\/Asian\n",{"type":"*","value":["Kiku — Rt. 17 N in Paramus"]},{"type":"*","value":["Ichiban"]},"\nAmerican\/Chain\n",{"type":"*","value":["(2) Houlihan's — Rt. 17 N in Ramsey or Rt 4.
