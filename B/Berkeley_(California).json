It's often better to stay on the main roads unless you know your way because of the many road barriers to prevent through traffic in residential areas. Be mindful of cyclists and pedestrians; many cyclists often ride in lanes (as is their legal right in California), and pedestrians may expect cars to stop for them. Remember that as a motorist, you need to be especially cautious in order to avoid harming cyclists and pedestrians. Be very careful when driving near the University as students tend to have the mindset that they have the right of way. To further confuse drivers many roads near the university are one way roads (and can turn so spontaneously - so watch signs at major intersections) or are closed to certain drivers.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Parking"]}," can be difficult and expensive near campus and downtown. The easiest and most expensive means of parking is in one of the several garages. The biggest garage near campus is the Telegraph Channing Garage. Many stores on Telegraph have validation coupons discounting hourly parking 50% or $5 off all-day parking. Arrive after 8PM and pay only $4 night rate until closing. Most street parking is either metered or 2-hour, but free after 6PM . If you are visiting a resident, they can purchase one day, 7-day, or 21-day street parking passes (not valid in metered spots) for you at city services in downtown. If you are fortunate to find a non-metered street parking close to your destination, you can park for free—some people are known to wipe off the chalk mark left by the meter maid (normally back of rear tire) every three hours or so. Be warned: This is not legal. In an extreme emergency (i.e., ten minutes late for your final exam), you can almost always find parking near the UC Berkeley police station near Sproul Hall. You might get a ticket, but you'll definitely get a kick-ass parking spot. Be aware of street sweeping signs, street sweeping is usually once a month, but the day varies from street to street (even from one side of the street to the other), a good rule of thumb is that if it seems like the street parking on one side is too good to be true - double check it isn't street sweeping. City parking fines run from $48 (Street sweeping and lack of permit in 2 hours spot) to over $300 (Disabled spot violations) and city parking enforcement is particularly vigilant so be aware - you can and will get multiple tickets for the same violation if you don't move quickly (parking 30 minutes in the 5 minute yellow zone can yield 5 $80 tickets).\n\nThe Eastshore Freeway which runs along the city's western edge is part of a short concurrency of I-80 and I-580 that may confuse some drivers. Heading south on the freeway toward the Bay Bridge and San Francisco, drivers are simultaneously following I-80 west and I-580 east. Drivers unfamiliar with the area should ensure they know whether their destination is toward Oakland and San Francisco or toward Richmond and Sacramento. These cities supplement the route designations at entrances to this freeway.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By public transit"]},"\nPublic transportation is thus an important consideration in getting to and around downtown and near the university. BART is the fastest connection to Oakland and San Francisco.  The Berkeley BART station located in Downtown Berkeley is usually the best option for travelers; the Ashby station is in a seedier part of South Berkeley and the North Berkeley station is located in a residential neighborhood near University Ave.  AC Transit goes places BART doesn't, such as the trendy Fourth Street commercial district (line 51B), the upscale Rockridge neighborhood (line 51B to 51A) and the resurgent Temescal commercial district in nearby North Oakland (line 1 or 1R).

Bicycle theft is a serious problem in Berkeley; if you ride your bike, be sure to lock your front wheel as well as the frame. Some choose to remove the seat as well, however this precaution is likely unnecessary if you are only leaving your bike for a short period of time and not overnight. AC Transit buses have racks on the front for bicycles. Bicycles are allowed on BART, but not on San Francisco bound trains during morning rush hour, and do not bring your bicycle in the first car. Check with BART before you leave or you'll get a warning from BART Police and forced to wait until permitted or else face a fine and a stern look from the officer. Folding bicycles are always allowed.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["On foot"]},"\nWalking is the least expensive and most effective means of getting around downtown and near campus.
