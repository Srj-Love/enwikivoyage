The centre on a Friday and Saturday night can be intimidating for \nsomeone if they are not used to the kind of atmosphere generated. \n\nJust west of Reading town centre, and in particular the Oxford Road \ndistrict, though improved, has suffered from drug abuse and the sex \ntrade. These areas are similar to those found around London, and are \nbest avoided at night. The Forbury Gardens and Abbey ruins, though attractive during the day, are best avoided after dark.\n\nAs always just be cautious of your surroundings; it's obvious in Reading when one enters into a rougher area, but generally one's chances of \nbeing a victim in Reading are slim.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]}," \n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Berkshire"]]}," \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Europe\/United_Kingdom\/England\/Berkshire"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["51.4167"],["-1.0000"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["South East England"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Berkshire"]]}]
