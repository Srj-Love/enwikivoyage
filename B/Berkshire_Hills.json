They are actually three separate mountain ranges, separated by the valleys of the Housatonic River in the south and the Hoosic River in the north.  East of the valleys a hilly plateau rising as high as 2,600' extends eastward toward the Connecticut River.  Beyond the limits of Berkshire County it is known as the Hilltowns and is covered in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pioneer Valley"]]}," region.  West of the valleys the narrower Taconic Range rises along the New York state border.  The third Berkshire range is Mount Greylock, at 3,487 ft (1,063 m) Massachusetts' high point, and its satellite peaks rising out of the valley between two upper branches of the Hoosac River.\n\nAlthough the Berkshires were historically part of New England's traditions of intellectualism, idealism, subsistence farming, logging, and early industrialization, they are almost equidistant between New York and Boston. Because New York has grown considerably larger and wealthier, the Berkshires are increasingly drawn into its economic and cultural orbit.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Regions"]},"\n\nBerkshire County is located at the western extreme of Massachusetts and borders ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rensselaer County"],["Rensselaer"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Columbia County (New York)"],["Columbia"]]}," Counties in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New York (state)"],["New York"]]},", Bennington County and Windham County in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southern Vermont"]]},", and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Litchfield Hills"]]}," region of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Connecticut"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities and towns"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Adams (Massachusetts)"],["Adams"]]}," - Birthplace of Susan B.

Dalton is also the home of Crane and Co. which has made the US currency and security papers for more than two centuries. There's a saying about the town that \"the buck starts here\". The Housatonic River winds south through Dalton and then through many other towns in Berkshire County on its 139 mile journey to the Long Island Sound. Dalton's surrounding mountains well exemplifies the many rolling hills for which the county is noted.              One well-known and often visited location east of town off of Route 9 is Wahconah Falls State Park. Water flows from the reservoir above down in a beautifully tiered fashion alongside a scenic hiking trail, culminating in a spectacular 40' decent into a deep pool. Legend has it that a love-sick Indian maiden named Wahconah jumped to her death there. However, upon further investigation, and contrary to this local lore, an article on the web (http:\/\/explorewmass.blogspot.com\/2010\/09\/legend-of-wahconah-falls.html) paints a decidedly happier tale of the Indian maiden's fate.
