The surrounding area was populated by Germanic Swabian and Burgundian tribes, as well as Slavic Wends in pre-Christian times, and the Wends have stuck around. Their modern descendants are the Sorbian Slavic-language minority, who live in villages southeast of Berlin near the Spree River.\n\nIn the beginning of the 13th century, two towns (Berlin and Cölln) developed on each side of the river Spree (today the Nikolaiviertel and the quarter next to it beyond the river). As the population grew, the towns merged and Berlin became a center for commerce and agriculture. This area stayed small (about 10,000 inhabitants) up to the late 17th century, because of the Thirty Years' War in the beginning of the 17th century, which led to death of about half of the population.\n\nSince the late 17th century, when large numbers of French Huguenots fled religious persecution, Berlin has welcomed religious, economic and other asylum seekers. In 1701, Berlin became the capital of Prussia, and in 1710, Berlin and surrounding former autonomous cities were merged to a bigger Berlin.\n\nIn 1871, Berlin became the capital of the new founded German Reich, and a few years later, it became a city with more than one million inhabitants because of the immensely growing industry.\n\nShortly after the First World War, in 1920, the last of the annexations of surrounding cities of Berlin led to the foundation of the Berlin as we know it now. After the coming into power of the National Socialists, Berlin became the capital of the so-called Third Reich and the domicile and office of Hitler. (The triumph of Hitler and his companions started in the south of Germany, though.)\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Siegessaeule Aussicht 10-13 img4 Tiergarten.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["Berlin panorama from the Siegessäule: Reichstag building with cupola (left), TV Tower and Dome (centre), Brandenburg Gate (right)"]]},"\nWorld War II led to destruction of most of central Berlin. Thus, many of the buildings which we see nowadays were reconstructed or planned and built after the war, leading to a very fragmented cityscape in most parts of the inner town. Berlin was divided into four sectors (West Berlin into the French, American and British sectors, while East Berlin belonged to the USSR). In 1949 the GDR was founded with East Berlin as its capital - West Berlin belonged to West Germany (with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bonn"]]}," as the capital) and was an exclave (political island) in East Germany. Because of the growing tensions between West Germany and the GDR, the latter built a wall between the countries and around West Berlin, so the division was complete.\n\nIn 1989 the German revolution took place – subsequently leading to the fall of the Berlin Wall – and in 1990 West and East Germany were merged officially together with Berlin becoming the capital of reunified Germany.\n\nAfter World War II and the building of the wall, large numbers of immigrants from Turkey were invited to West Berlin to work in the growing industry sector; in East Berlin the jobs were done mostly by Vietnamese immigrants. In addition, people from other communist countries, including the former Yugoslavia, not to mention Soviet soldiers who refused to return home, have helped to make Berlin more multicultural than ever.\n\nBerlin is also a youth-oriented city. Before German unification, West Berliners were exempt from the West German civil\/military service requirement. Social activists, pacifists and anarchists of all moved to Berlin for that reason alone. Musicians and artists were given state subsidies. It was easy to stay out all night thanks to liberal bar licensing laws, and staying at university for years without ever getting a degree was a great way to kill time. In contrast with most of Germany, Prenzlauer Berg is said to have the highest per-capita birth rate in Europe (though in fact it just seems so because of the high percentage of young women in the district).\n\nAfter the fall of the wall, Berlin - especially the former East - has evolved into a cultural mecca. Artists and other creative souls flocked to the city in swarms after reunification, primarily due to the extremely low cost of living in the East. Despite the increased prices and gentrification that has resulted, Berlin has become a center for art, design, multimedia, electronic music, and fashion among other things. The particularly high number of students and young people in the city has only helped this cause. Just stroll down a street in Prenzlauer Berg, Friedrichshain, or Mitte to get a glimpse of the new East Berlin.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Berlin - Marienkirche - Fernsehturm - 20090405.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["The old and new of Berlin - Marienkirche & TV Tower"]]},"\n\nSome famous artists of the region and their best-known works include Lucas Cranach the Elder, Lucas Cranach the Younger, Johann Gottfried Schadow, Marlene Dietrich (",{"type":"''","value":["The Blue Angel"]},"), Leni Riefenstahl (",{"type":"''","value":["Triumph of the Will"]},"), Bertolt Brecht (",{"type":"''","value":["Threepenny Opera"]},"), Käthe Kollwitz, Kurt Tucholsky, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Walter Gropius, Paul Klee, Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau (",{"type":"''","value":["Nosferatu"]},"), Fritz Lang (",{"type":"''","value":["Metropolis"]},"), Volker Schlöndorff, Wim Wenders (",{"type":"''","value":["Wings of Desire"]}," (German: ",{"type":"''","value":["Der Himmel über Berlin"]},")), Blixa Bargeld\/Einstürzende Neubauten, Christopher Isherwood, Gunter Grass (",{"type":"''","value":["The Tin Drum"]},"), members of the Bauhaus architectural movement and many more.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh =   3"],["febhigh =   4"],["marhigh =   9"],["aprhigh =   13"],["mayhigh =   19"],["junhigh =   22"],["julhigh =   24"],["aughigh =   24"],["sephigh =   19"],["octhigh =   13"],["novhigh =   7"],["dechigh =   4"],["janlow =   -2"],["feblow =   -2"],["marlow =   1"],["aprlow =   4"],["maylow =   9"],["junlow =   12"],["jullow =   15"],["auglow =   14"],["seplow =   11"],["octlow =   6"],["novlow =   2"],["declow =   0"],["janprecip = 42"],["febprecip = 33"],["marprecip = 41"],["aprprecip = 37"],["mayprecip = 54"],["junprecip = 69"],["julprecip = 56"],["augprecip = 58"],["sepprecip = 45"],["octprecip = 37"],["novprecip = 44"],["decprecip = 55"]]},"\n\nBerlin has a temperate oceanic climate, meaning warms summers and cold winters.

The implication here is that after reunification, the West Germans automatically assumed the way they do things is the right way, and the way the Easterners should start doing it, too. Westerners got a reputation for being arrogant.

Due to the football World Cup in 2006 all public transportation staff got language training and, at least in theory, should be able to help you in English (although possibly with a strong German accent). If you seem to be lost or hesitating in a public transport station a member of staff could come to your assistance but don't count on that. You can easily approach a group of (preferably young) bystanders and ask for advice in English.\n\nMost people under 40 in Berlin are able to speak English with varying degrees of fluency, but it might not be as widely spoken as you might expect, so a few key German phrases are worth having, especially in the suburbs and less touristy places. Basic French and Russian are also spoken by some Berliners, because French in West Berlin and Russian in East Berlin were taught in schools.\n\nThere are also 400,000 people of Turkish origin living in Berlin, mainly in the Western districts. Many of them arrived in early 1960's from remote villages in Anatolia as guest workers but stayed on.\n\nThere are some words in Berlin that differ from regular German, especially in the former East Berlin.

That research is exported around the world. German labour is highly efficient but comes at a high cost. Strong trade unions, the end of West Berlin's pre-reunification subsidies and Germany's dense regulatory environment forced industry to concentrate on high quality and expensive products.

A good map is highly recommended. While the public transport system is superb, it can be confusing to visitors, due to a lack of directional signs in some of the larger stations, so a good transit map is also essential. Be sure to note the final station\/stop of the S-bahn or U-bahn, since that is usually the way direction of travel is indicated.  Roads into Berlin can also be confusing, so study your route and drive carefully. Signs point to city boroughs or districts rather than indicating compass directions, so it's a good idea to get to know where the various boroughs or districts lie in relation to each other.

The opening itself had been originally scheduled for 2011 and has since been postponed many times due to construction and safety issues. Every few months a new date is announced and, therefore, much of the tourist information has been published in recent years with the \"impending\" opening of BER and closure of TXL and SXF in mind. Do bear in mind that until the BER airport is actually opened, those remain incorrect and there is no passenger traffic to and from BER and much of the infrastructure there is still not functional.\n\nOn the other hand, because both TXL and SXF were scheduled to close, they have not been updated for the past years, while both are in dire need of both update and expansion given the current traffic volumes and advances in air travel. In particular TXL found itself handling far more traffic than it was designed for. In comparison with other, usually very well-planned and cutting-edge German Airports, experiencing the airports of Berlin can be a disappointment until BER opens.\n\nCarriers frequently switched between TXL and SXF in recent years and, although one carrier tends to serve one airport only, there is a very mixed bundle of connections from every airport.

It was the airport for West Berlin during the Cold War and today is the main airport for major flag carriers such as Air France, British Airways, KLM, Lufthansa and United. The original airport was designed as a hexagon but today two other terminals try to handle the flights of Air Berlin (most flights in Terminal C) and other budget carriers (mostly in terminal D).

This makes flying out of the main terminal building a very swift and comfortable experience.\n\nThat said, connecting via Tegel may not be as comfortable, because you will probably need to go through security anyway, and there is quite a walk (outside!) between terminals, particularly Terminal C. Except for Terminal A, no gates have jetways and you will need to either be ferried by bus or actually walk from the plane to the terminal. The waiting space and shopping within Tegel is also limited and not really top-notch, although Air Berlin offers their frequent fliers separate \"exclusive waiting areas\" (not available to other ",{"type":"''","value":["oneworld"]}," frequent fliers!).

Much of the network are actually overground stretches running over the characteristic viaducts that can be found throughout the city and add a certain flavour to Berlin's cityscape (this arrangement is similar to light rail systems existing in some North American cities or the ",{"type":"''","value":["M6"]}," line in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Paris"]]},").\n\nDetailed maps can be found in every U-Bahn station and on the trains.

The city is multicultural and many cultures' cuisine is represented here somewhere, although it is often modified to suit German tastes.

Please note that lately European debit cards are not always accepted because due to debit card fraud, some processing companies stopped intra-European cards from specific countries. This does not apply to debit cards that are from German banks. Better have cash or ask the restaurant staff.\n\nOne of the main tourist areas for eating out is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hackescher Markt \/ Oranienburger Straße"]},". This area has dramatically changed during the years: once full of squats and not-entirely-legal bars and restaurants, it had some real character. It is rapidly being developed and corporatized, and even the most famous squat - the former Jewish-owned proto-shopping mall \"Tacheles\" - has had a bit of a facelift. There are still some gems in the side streets, though, The \"Assel\" (Woodlouse) on Oranienburger Straße, furnished with DDR-era furniture, is still relatively authentic and worth a visit, especially on a warm summer night. Oranienburger Straße is also an area where prostitutes line up at night, but don't be put off by this. The area is actually very safe since several administrative and religious buildings are located here.\n\nFor cheap and good food (especially from Turkey and the Middle East) you should try ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Berlin\/Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg"],["Kreuzberg"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Berlin\/Neukolln"],["Neukölln"]]}," with their abundance of Indian, pizza and ",{"type":"''","value":["Döner Kebap"]}," restaurants.

Some mainstream clubs are located in Charlottenburg and at Potsdamer Platz. Electro and techno are still the biggest in Berlin, with lots of progressive DJs and live acts around. But there are also many clubs playing '60s beat, alternative rock and of course mainstream music. Clubbing days are Thursday, Friday and especially Saturday, but some clubs are open every day of the week. Partying in Berlin starts around midnight (weekends) and peaks around 2AM or 3AM in the normal clubs, a bit later in many electro\/techno clubs.

The boom leads to a significant oversupply of hotels which results in comparatively cheap prices even in the 5 star category (off-season prices of €110 per night are not unusual). Especially for a short visit, it may be best to stay at a place in Berlin-Mitte (around Friedrichstraße), as most of the main sights are located there. Due to its history most hotels in Berlin are still located in the City West (i.e. Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf), especially close to Zoo station. Alexanderplatz and Anhalter Bahnhof have clusters of 2-3 star budget hotels (i.e. Ibis, Motel One). You'll find currently only budget hotels (Motel One and Meininger) located directly at the new main train station but some large constructions under in progress. The (oddly named) budget hotel chain 'Motel-One' operates various 2-star hotels in the city centre. There are also many 3-4 star 'NH Hotels' offering good value. All major hotel chains are present in Berlin. A good idea to check that the hotel is close to public transport (U-Bahn or S-Bahn) to avoid too long walks.\n\nCheapest are youth hostels (called Jugendherbergen, only for members) and hostels (similar to youth hostels, but for everyone, mostly backpackers stay here, usually in one to 32-bed rooms).

(Friedrichshain) and start again in the evening of May 1 in Kreuzberg and in the mentioned areas. The violent riots have become rather small since 2005 due to the engagement of the citizens who celebrate the Labour Day with a nice \"myfest\" in Kreuzberg and well-planned police efforts.

Tourists should visit these areas with some caution during the night as a mixture of drunken party people and poor neighbourhoods might lead to trouble.\n\nAlthough harmless, panhandlers have recently started to beg at local tourist spots such as Pariser Platz next to the Brandenburg Gate, Alexanderplatz and the Museuminsel. They are usually women accompanied by their daughters who ask if you speak English and say that they are from the new EU countries and trying to raise money to fly home. The story is false, so don't give them money, which would encourage further exploitation of the women and their kids. They also have a new tactic where they hand you a card telling their \"story\" and asking for money; beware that the children that they carry in their arms will search through your bags while you are reading the card. The best way to avoid this is simply to ignore them and not to respond when they ask you \"Speak English?\" If you feel scared, don't hesitate to contact the police, as they will help.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Prostitution"]},"\n\nProstitution is a legal business in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Germany#Prostitution"],["Germany"]]},". Berlin has no major red-light district though some big brothels were built.

The Oranienburger Straße in Mitte is infamous for its prostitutes at night. These women are a tourist attraction and the ladies focus only on tourists to request exorbitant prices.\n\nThe proximity to Eastern Europe, relaxed visa rules, and the illegal migrant community increases the number of prostitutes. Advertisements are in the tabloids and online. Human trafficking and illegal immigration is a problem; therefore, police raids do take place and close down illegal places. Brothels and prostitutes must register like normal businesses, or they will be prosecuted for tax evasion. In general, the police officers are not interested in the clients  (especially if you stay calm and don't try to argue) but you must have a photo ID (passport copy is fine) with you.
