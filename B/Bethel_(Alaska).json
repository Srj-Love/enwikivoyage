It is the main hub for many of the surrounding native villages and the main port of the Kuskokwim River in the Yukon Kuskokwim Delta. Bethel is one of the largest cities in Alaska. It's also home to the K-300 dogsled race ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.k300.org"]}," and Cama-I ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/bethelarts.com\/"]},", the largest Native Arts festival in Alaska.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nBecause of its location and culture, there is much that a traveler would benefit from understanding before visiting Bethel.  The town is far off the road system, 400 air miles west of Anchorage, and all fuel, grocery, household items, building materials, vehicles, etc., must be flown in or shipped in by barge.  Consequently, prices are relatively high, even by Alaskan standards.  It is good to remember, however, that as a hub community, Bethel prices are still less (sometimes by half) than prices even in nearby villages.\n\nThe Y-K Delta (as the greater area is called) is home to an active subsistence culture.  Many residents, both Native and Non-Native, fish and hunt for food as well as for sport.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get In"]},"\n\nThe only practical way into Bethel from outside the immediate area is by air, and Bethel is served by a number of daily flights from Anchorage.  Alaska Airlines ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.alaskaair.com"]}," has morning, afternoon, and evening flights, with Era Alaska ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.flyera.com"]}," adding additional flights in the morning and afternoon.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nThere are a number of transportation options in and around Bethel for visitors and residents, depending on one's level of ambition:\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By Plane"]},"\n\nThe state-owned Bethel Airport is the regional transportation center, and is served by seven passenger carriers, including Alaska Airlines, Grant Aviation, Hageland Aviation Services, Yute Air and Frontier Flying Service. It also receives service from five cargo operators: Everts Air Cargo, Northern Air Cargo, Alaska Central Express, Arctic Transportation Services, and Lynden Air Cargo, and numerous small air taxi services including Renfro's Alaskan Adventures. The airport ranks third in the state for total number of flights. It offers a 6,400 foot asphalt runway and 1,850 foot gravel crosswind runway, and is currently undergoing a $7 million renovation and expansion. Three float plane bases are nearby: Hangar Lake, H Marker Lake, and the Kuskokwim River. See the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Go next"]}," section for more details.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By Taxi"]},"\n\nBethel has more cabs per capita than any other city in the United States.  Due to the dependence of many residents and visitors on cabs, and the high cost of transportation, cab fee maximums are mandated by the City of Bethel, corresponding roughly to the distance of the trip.  Rides within the central area of town are $5, to or from the Tundra Ridge subdivision are $7, to or from the Airport is $7, and trips to the Kasayuli Subdivision are $10.\n\nSomething important for visitors to Bethel to know is that cab rides in Bethel are often a \"communal\" experience.  While riding in a cab from the airport into the main part of town, for example, the cab driver may get a call to pick up another fare in Blueberry Subdivision.  While potentially uncomfortable for the shy traveler (or if the cab gets too crowded), this is actually a great way to meet people in Bethel.\n\nThese are numbers for the taxi services in Bethel\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Alaska Cab"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1-907-543-2111"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=City Cab"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1-907-543-4141"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Kusko Cab"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1-907-543-2169"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Quyana Cab"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1-907-543-5454"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Taxi Cab"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1-907-543-5199"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By Public Transit"]},"\n\nA more recent addition to Bethel's transportation options is the city bus.

As is true with most everything in Bethel, prices are substantially higher than one would expect, both to purchase (or ship in), own, and maintain a car in the rural setting, but many people feel it is worth it for convenience and independence.\n\nGas prices are high, but do not fluctuate daily as in other places.  Cost is set by the retailers when new supplies are barged in through the brief summer months, meaning the price of gas will only change a couple times a year.
