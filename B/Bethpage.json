As of the 2010 census, the population of Bethpage was 16,429, which has been moving up and down since the creation of this town. Although a small town, Bethpage has a rich history. This town is home to the Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation better known today as Northrop Grumman, which is responsible for the creation of the F-14 Tomcat fighter jet and the Apollo Lunar Excursion Module (LEM). For this reason Bethpage is mentioned in the movie Apollo 13 starring Tom Hanks. Also, Bethpage is home to one of the most renowned golf courses in the United States, the Bethpage Black. This course has grabbed the attention from golfers such as Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, and many more. This town is a great place to visit year round with great food, great drinks, and great people.
