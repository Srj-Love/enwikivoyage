The first European-American settlers established a village which they called Lillienthal, after an early tavern and dance hall. The village of Gilbert developed alongside Lillienthal in 1858, honoring Elias Gilbert, who platted the original site. At that time, the residents were predominantly German immigrants and worked as farmers, skilled laborers, and small business owners. The two villages eventually combined to become the town of Gilbert.  The town gave William and Joseph Bettendorf 70 acres along the riverfront on the condition that they move their iron wagon business from Davenport to Gilbert. In 1903 the town petitioned for incorporation and requested that its name change to honor the brothers whose factory was a major economic influence in the early development of the city.  The first modern-day riverboat casinos in the United States were launched in Bettendorf on April 1, 1991 by local businessman Bernard Goldstein. He went on to found the Isle of Capri Casinos. According to the 2010 census Bettendorf is home to 33,217.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:I-74 Bridge.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["300px"],["I-74 Bridge"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nMost people arrive using Interstate 74, the easiest route if arriving at Quad City International Airport.

The city streets are basically laid out in a grid pattern, especially in the older part of town.  Some of the newer residential sections of the city do not follow a grid, however.  For the most part, east-west streets are named and the north-south streets are numbered starting at the border with Davenport.  There are a couple of exceptions.  Devils Glen Road is a north-south Street on the east side of town and 53rd Avenue is an east west street on the north side that connects with 53rd Street in Davenport.  Middle Road is a major thoroughfare through the middle of town as the name suggests.  However, it defies the grid pattern as it travels northeast from Locust Street in Davenport before it heads north to I-80.
