Bečići is a tourist complex set behind the renowned Bečići Beach, near the historic town of Budva on Montenegro's Adriatic coast. It's a laid back location and the beautiful sandy beach and general amenities make it ideal for families. A centre for bathing and relaxation, it offers a wide range of water sports and other sporting facilities.\nBečići beach won the \"Grand Prix\" in Paris in 1935 as the most beautiful beach in Europe.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nModern, tourist-focussed Bečići is perfectly complemented by the charms of the old walled town of Budva, with its selection of cafes, restaurants and shops, which is just over a mile away along the coastal promenade, or, if you prefer, by a small train. Founded in the ninth century and destroyed and rebuilt several times, Budva is believed to be one of the oldest settlements in the Balkans. There was a Hellenic colony here as far back as the 4th century BC. The fifteenth century fortifications, protruding into the sea, include medieval ramparts and towers. Elsewhere, the architecture shows Venetian influences. The old town was built on a little island, connected to the mainland by a sandbar, which, over the centuries, has silted up to become a peninsula. The white stone walls and red-tile roofs are interspersed with bougainvillea and oleander.\nWalking out of Bečići in the other direction, you reach the old fishing village of Rafailovići, with its pleasant cafes and restaurants.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Tivat airport"]}," is 20 km away.

They are allowed to play music until 01AM, when the crowds move to some of the nightclubs. Arguably the best nightclub in Budva is newly built closed \"Trocadero\", which has prices slightly higher than other nightclubs.\nThere are also two remote nightclubs, \"Maine\" and \"Torine\", the latter being in Bečići, but those are often too crowded and insist on folk music.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nAccommodation in Bečići is abundant, and varies from renting a room for €10 to handsomely priced five-star hotels.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Budget"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Youth Hostel \"Uzice\""],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.decije-odmaraliste.com"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" A room can be rented easily from the local people and the price varies from as low as €7-10 to €30 for more luxurious rooms closer to city center."]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Mid range"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hotel Obala"]}]},"\nThere are dozens of other mid-range hotels throughout Bečići...\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Splurge"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Hotel Mediteran"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.hotelmediteran.info"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Iberostar Bellevue"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.iberostar.com\/EN\/Montenegro-Becici-hotels\/Iberostar-Bellevue_3_104.html"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=Hotel"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Hotel Montenegro"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.montenegrostars.com"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Hotel Splendid"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.montenegrostars.com"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Go next "]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Budva"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sveti Stefan"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Budva Riviera"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usablecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Bečići"]]},{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["42.283888888889"],["18.869166666667"]]}]
