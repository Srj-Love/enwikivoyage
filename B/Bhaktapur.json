The conch shaped historic city is spread over an area of just 6.88 square kilometer at 1,401 meter altitude. The city was founded in the 12th century by King Anand Dev Malla. Bhaktapur was the capital city of the Greater Malla Kingdom in the Kathmandu Valley till the 15th century AD. The many of Bhaktapur's greatest monuments were built by the Malla rulers of that earlier time.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nBhaktapur has more temples per square foot than ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Patan"]]}," or Kathmandu and is far enough out of town to keep the crowds away. As a World Heritage site listed by the UNESCO, Bhaktapur has been heavily restored since a 1934 earthquake severely damaged the city. To further restoration and preservation there is an entrance fee for visitors. In December 2011 this was either NPR1100 or USD11 for foreigners. If you plan to visit for several days, you can ask the counter to add a note to permit access to the city with the same ticket (at most one week). Visitors from SAARC member countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) and China pay NPR100.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Lord Dattatreya from Devgad.jpg"],["thumb"],["Lord Dattatreya from Devgad"]]},"\n\nIf you are not arriving as part of a tour group, you may take mini bus (bound for Kamal Binayak stop in Bhaktapur) or big bus (bound for Chyamasingha stop in Bhaktapur) from Bus Stop near Bhadrakali. You can save time by taking Express Bus (this does not stop in between except in Maitighar and Sallaghari) from Bagbazar in Kathmandu. Recently, micro buses also started service of shuttling between Kathmandu and Bhaktapur, which provide a fairly quick way to get to Bhaktapur.\n\nFor those who haven't experienced a public bus in South Asia, it will be a way to (literally!) rub shoulders with locals. In either case the ride takes about 40–60 minutes and drops you off just outside of town. The cost of the fare from Kathmandu to Bhaktapur is approximately NPR35 (Sept 2009) by bus for local people. Average taxi fee from Thamel to Bhaktapur (one way) costs about NPR800-1000 for the 16 km drive. You can easily hail a taxi or pick up a return bus to either Patan or Kathmandu just outside of the first main gate that leads into the city.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nOnce in Bhaktapur, walking is really the only way to experience the quiet, dusty lanes squares.
