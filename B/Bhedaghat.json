The serene loveliness of the scene is one of cool quiet, the sunlight sparkling on the marble-white pinnacles and casting dappled shadows on the pellucid waters. These white rocks with views of black and dark green volcanic seams are truly majestic on moonlit nights.\n\nThe holy river flows by tranquilly flanked by the towering cliffs which reflect in it like a mirror the changing moods of nature. A little distance away, it becomes turbulent as it plunges in a mighty water fall known as Dhuandhar. \n\nIn his Highlands of Central India Captain J. Forsyth speaks eloquently about the infinitely varied beauty of the rocks : \n\n\"the eye never wearies of the . . . effect produced by the broken and reflected sunlight, now glancing from a pinnacle of snow-white marble reared against the deep blue of the sky as from a point of silver, touching here and there with bright lights the prominence of the middle heights and again losing itself in the soft bluish grays of their recesses. . . \nHere and there the white saccharine limestone is seamed by veins of dark green or black volcanic rock; a contrast which only enhances like a setting of jet, the purity of the surrounding marble.\"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jabalpur"]]}," about 30km away is the nearest airport.\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jabalpur"]]}," railway station is the nearest one.

Boating facilities are available between November-May. Boating on a moonlit night, when the whole stretch of water is transformed into a sheet of liquid silver. In the narrow channel of the mighty river, there is a place approached so closely from the opposite banks that the local people have aptly named it the \"Monkey's Leap\" .\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Dhuandhar Falls"]},"\nThe Narmada, making its way through the Marble Rock,s narrows down and then plunges in a waterfall known as Dhuandhar or the smoke casade.
