Bhutan is the only Vajrayana Buddhist nation in the world, and the profound teachings of this tradition remain well preserved and exert a strong influence in all aspects of life.  Due to its pristine environment and harmonious society, the tiny Kingdom of Bhutan has been called \"The Last ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shangrila"]]},".\"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nBhutan is a unique country both culturally and environmentally.  Perched high in the Himalayas, it is the world’s last remaining Buddhist Kingdom.  It has developed the philosophy of Gross National Happiness; where development is measured using a holistic approach of well-being, not just based on gross domestic product.  Chilies are considered a vegetable and ema datshi the national dish.  Ema datchi consists of green chilies mixed in with a Bhutanese cheese sauce.  \nIt is still termed as a third world country with subsistence farming practiced in much of the country.  In broad terms the land is fertile and the population small. In addition, the current generation receives free education, and all citizens have access to free, though rudimentary, medical care.  The sale of tobacco products is banned and smoking in public areas is a fineable offense.\n\nMajor sources of income for the kingdom are tourism, hydroelectric power and agriculture.\n\nWhile traditional culture has been very well preserved, the opening of the country to TV and internet in 1999 has had a major effect, and modern-day culture is mostly centred on bars and snooker halls. As a result, there is very little or no evidence of quality contemporary art, theatre or music.\n\nCulturally, Bhutan is predominantly Buddhist with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dzongkha phrasebook"],["Dzongkha"]]}," as a national language (although there are regional variations - such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sharchopkha phrasebook"],["Sharchopkha"]]},", the predominant language in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Eastern Bhutan"]]},"), and a common dress code and architectural style. Bhutanese people primarily consist of the Ngalops and Sharchops, called the Western Bhutanese and Eastern Bhutanese, and Lhotshamphas (Southern Bhutanese), a people of Nepalese Gurkha Origin, respectively. The Ngalops primarily consist of Bhutanese living in the western part of the country. Their culture is closely related to that of their neighbor to the north, Tibet.\n \nThe kingdom became a parliamentary democracy in March 2008 at the initiation of the Fourth King. Despite that, many steps still need to be done towards a real democracy, as up to today Bhutanese people and foreigners are not allowed to marry, and even international marriages are not recognized from the Bhutanese government, resulting impossible for a Bhutanese to marry a foreigner and to live there with the family as any rights are given. Therefore, foreigners willing to visit Bhutan can do that but shall be aware that it is not a real democracy but a regime, where people are not free and where difference of opinions and speech do not exist in reality. The tourist shall know that everything that they know from outside Bhutan is wisely written by the government inside, to convey an idilliac image of the Country, which is not real. Bhutan still lacks in human rights and the power in charge is still managing the country in a medieval way.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Gross National Happiness"]},"\n\nThis ideology was the brain child of King Jigme Singye Wangchuck who, having gained a modern education in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["India"]]}," and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["UK"]]},", realized that mere economic success did not necessarily translate into a content and happy society. Consequently, soon after his coronation in 1974, the young king began to float the idea of developing a new set of guidelines by which to govern the country. Slowly these ideas took shape, and in 1998 the GNH indicator was established. GNH stands for \"Gross National Happiness\" and is defined by the following four objectives: to increase economic growth and development, preserve and promote the cultural heritage, encourage sustainable use of the environment, and establish good governance. While the concept of GNH receives much international praise and is a major draw for tourists, potential visitors should be aware that the idea is very much in its incubation stage, and there is very little evidence of GNH in the country itself.\n\nOn 19 July 2011, 68 countries joined the Kingdom of Bhutan in co-sponsoring a resolution titled “Happiness: Towards a holistic approach to development,” which was adopted by consensus by the 193-member UN General Assembly.\nIn follow up to the resolution, the Royal Government of Bhutan convened a High Level Meeting on “Happiness and Well Being: Defining a New Economic Paradigm” on 2 April 2012 at the United Nations headquarters in New York.\nThis meeting initiated the next steps towards realizing the vision of a new well being and sustainability based economic paradigm that effectively integrates economic, social, and environmental objectives. Following this resolution, Bhutan continues to be a champion of the resolution and actively promotes the concept internationally.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nThe first humans probably arrived sometime after the Ice Age, and little is known about Bhutan's prehistory. Historical records began with the arrival of Buddhism in the 7th century, when Guru Rinpoche (Padmasambhava) visited Bhutan and established monasteries.\n\nIn 1865, Britain and Bhutan signed the Treaty of Sinchulu, under which Bhutan would receive an annual subsidy in exchange for ceding some border land. Under British influence, a monarchy was set up in 1907; three years later, a treaty was signed whereby the British agreed not to interfere in Bhutanese internal affairs and Bhutan allowed Britain to direct its foreign affairs. This role was assumed by independent India after 1947. Two years later, a formal Indo-Bhutanese accord returned the areas of Bhutan annexed by the British, formalized the annual subsidies the country received, and defined India's responsibilities in defense and foreign relations.\n\nIn December 2006, King Jigme Singye Wangchuck transferred power to his oldest son, the Crown Prince Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, bestowing upon him the title of the fifth Druk Gyalpo. The official coronation took place in November 2008. The Fifth King is Boston and Oxford educated and is held in high esteem throughout the country.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["Guru Rinpoche"],["It is not possible to travel far in Bhutan without seeing images of a man wearing a tall elaborate hat and with eyes that are open wide and staring forward into space.  This is the great 8th century sage of Vajrayana Buddhism, Padmasambhava or Guru Rinpoche as he often called. According to legend, Padmasambhava was reincarnated into a lotus blossom as an eight year old child, and from very young he possessed great wisdom and insight.  Furthermore, he had mastery of the elements and so like a potter manipulating  basic clay and turning it into beautiful pots, he was able to transform harmful action and substances into something positive and beneficial.\n\nGuru Rinpoche's special association with Bhutan began when he traveled to the town now known as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jakar"]]}," at the invitation of a local king to subjugate negative forces. The mission was a success, and from this encounter Buddhism spread throughout the land.

Winter lasts here from November to March. Punakha is an exception as it is in a lower valley and summer is hot and winter is pleasant.  Southern Bhutan bordering with India is hot and humid with a sub-tropical climate. While the monsoon affects northern Indian it does not command the same influence in Bhutan.  Summer months tend to be wetter with isolated showers predominately in the evenings only.  Winter is by far the driest period while spring and autumn tend to be pleasant.\n\nThere are four distinct seasons similar in their divisions to those of Western Europe. Temperatures in the far south range from 15°C in winter (December to February) to 30°C in summer (June to August). In Thimphu the range is from -2.5°C in January to 25°C in August and with a rainfall of 100mm.
