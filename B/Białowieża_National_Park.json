It contains several species of fauna which were once native in forests throughout Europe, but which have now been mostly eradicated. It is, for example, the only place where European Bison, (German: ",{"type":"''","value":["Wisent"]},", Polish: ",{"type":"''","value":["Żubr"]},") still remain free and living in the forest as they once did throughout Europe. Wolves, Lynx, Red Deer, Wild Boar, Elk (same as Moose in N. America), and Roe Deer are among its other inhabitants.\n\nHopefully plans in the future will include returning reverse-bred versions of the extinct Tarpan Horse and Aurochs.  Breeds that try to mimic Tarpan Horses  can be found living in other smaller nature parks and zoos in Europe.\n\nThe inner-most sanctuary of The Białowieża National Park is completely preserved and protected by a fence, with tourists only allowed inside with guides. Inside, the forest lives, breathes and decays as it has for thousands of years. Outside of the inner-sanctuary several more kilometers of forest are semi-preserved although sadly there are many reports of thinning and cutting of trees, supposedly due to disease, but more likely due to corruption and the market demand for large trees. Several extra kilometers of forest protection boundary could be added to this as a buffer.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe town of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Białowieża"]]}," is on the edge of the forest and is located in the Polish part of the reserve.
