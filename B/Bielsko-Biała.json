It is situated 50 km south of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Katowice"]]}," and 75 km west of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kraków"]]},". The city was once renowned for its magnificent linen, but now its main industries are strictly mechanical. The average relative height difference between places in the city goes as big as 900 meters, as in the city borders there are several mountain peaks - that generates magnificent view. Bielsko-Biała is place of tourism, people from all over the country visit the city as it is logistical and cultural center for nearby ski-sport towns, such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Szczyrk"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wisła"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ustroń"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Żywiec"]]},".\n\nThe today's center of the town was probably developed as early as in the first half of the 13th century. It was then when a castle was built on a hill still used for this purpose today. Sometime in the 13th or 14th century the town was granted a town charter; the exact date is unknown because the document is now lost.\n\nThe town of Bielsko was first mentioned in a letter by a Duke of Cieszyn in 1312. For centuries, Bielsko belonged to the Duchy of Cieszyn. From 1457 the Biała river was the border between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Silesia"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lesser Poland"]]},". Silesia belonged to Austria, Little Poland to Poland. In 1723 on the opposite bank of the river the city of Biała came into being.\n\nIn 1772 Biała was annexed by Austria and included in the crownland of Galicia. In 1918 both cities became part of reborn Poland, though a significant part of the population was ethnic German. During World War II the city was annexed to the Third Reich and its Jewish population sent to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Auschwitz"]]}," Nazi German concentration camp. After the liberation of the city by the Red Army in 1945, the ethnic German population was expelled. The city of Bielsko-Biała was created on January 1, 1951 when the adjacent cities of Bielsko and Biała were unified.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Katowice-Pyrzowice"]}," airport in Pyrzowice (80 km from Bielsko-Biała) is an airport for domestic and European flights to following cities:\n\n",{"type":"{|","value":[["|width=\"30%\" valign=\"top\" |"],[{"type":"*","value":[" Athens"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Barcelona"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Belfast"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Cologne"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Cork"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Dortmund"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Dublin"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Düsseldorf"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Doncaster - Sheffield"]},"|width=\"30%\" valign=\"top\" |"],[{"type":"*","value":[" Edinburgh"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Frankfurt"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Frankfurt (Hann)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Koln"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Liverpool"]},{"type":"*","value":[" London"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Milan"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Munich (München)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Oslo"]},"|width=\"30%\" valign=\"top\" |"],[{"type":"*","value":[" Palma de Mallorca"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Paris"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Paris (Beauvais)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Rome"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Rhodes"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Stockholm"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Thessaloniki"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Warsaw"]}]]},"\n\nThere's a frequent shuttle bus from outside the terminal building to the city centre dropping off near main railway station.\n\nFor further information see ",{"type":"''","value":["GTL Airport Katowice - Pyrzowice"]}," ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.gtl.com.pl\/eng\/index.html\/"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["GTL Travel"]}," ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.gtltravel.com.pl\/index.php?lng=en"]},".\n\nThe other option, perhaps better is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Balice Airport"]}," (",{"type":"'''","value":["KRK"]},") ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.lotnisko-balice.pl\/eng\/"]}," - it is the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kraków"]]}," airport, located about 65 km to the east of Bielsko-Biała.
