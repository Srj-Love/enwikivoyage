It's one of the largest national parks in the country and one of the last remaining freshwater tide wetlands in Europe. A fine web of rivers and creeks runs through an area characterized by reed fields, willow forests and moist grasslands. It's an ideal habitat for waterfowl and migrating geese, but there's an abundance of other flora and fauna to be found too. For example, following the 1994 recognition as a protected national park, Eurasian beavers were released and settled in the area.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Biesbosch 20050928 40011.JPG"],["thumb"],["Areal view of a part of the Biesbosch"]]},"\nIt's important to understand that the Biesbosch as a natural area is much larger than the National Park. The parts outside of the park are far more cultivated and inhabited, but are also characterized by countless streams and lakes.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nIn the middle ages, this area was called the Grote Hollandse Waard and consisted of cultivated polder lands, dotted with villages and hamlets. The area was protected by dikes, which in the 15th century suffered from a serious lack of maintenance, due to both political and economic crises. As a result, the dikes collapsed in the famous 1421 St. Elizabeth flood. Some 300 km2 of polder was submerged, dozens of villages were lost and several thousands of people drowned. A common misunderstanding says this flood created the Biesbosch more or less overnight. In reality however, the network of creeks, mudflats and willow forests arose that you'll find today developed over the decades following the storm.\n\nOver recent centuries, large parts of the Biesbosch were reclaimed. Large parts were turned back into polders. The course of the large rivers Meuse and Rhine was slightly changed to make them more easy to manage and several smaller streams were closed off at their upstream ends to decrease risks of flood in inhabited areas. Due to several of such changes, the Biesbosch now only draws water from the rivers in times of high discharges and has mostly lost its function as a river delta.\n\nUntil 1970 the tides would cause a difference in water level of up to 2 meters. With the establishment of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Delta Works"]]},", however, most of the influence of the sea was lost. Only in the northern parts of the Biesbosch tidal difference remain, but no more than 20 to 80 cm. \n\nThe National Park was finally created in 1994.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe typical places to start your visit of the Biesbosch is at one of the two visitors' centres, in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dordrecht"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Drimmelen"]]},", or from the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Biesbosch museum"]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Werkendam"]]},".

For several years, a single couple of ",{"type":"'''","value":["White-tailed Eagles"]}," has lived here and in 2011 even made a nest.
