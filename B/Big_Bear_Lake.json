Benjamin Davis Wilson and a crew of twenty men rode into Yuhaviat Valley chasing Native Americans that had been raiding their ranches in Riverside, CA.  While in the valley, the men discovered that it was teeming with grizzly bear.  Thus, Wilson came up with the name, Big Bear Lake, for the valley.\n\nBefore Big Bear Lake became a popular vacation spot, it was known as a gold mining mecca.  In 1860, a bear tracker named, William Holcomb, discovered a creek filled with flakes of gold while tracking a bear’s blood trail.  Word soon got around that there was gold in the valley.  From 1860 to 1875, Big Bear Lake was swarming with prospectors in search of gold.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nThe average maximum annual temperature for Big Bear Lake is 62.2 degrees Fahrenheit and the average minimum annual temperature is 31.7 degrees Fahrenheit.
