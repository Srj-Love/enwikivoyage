Gorgeous campsites along a creek that runs into the ocean. Sites on the beach and under the redwoods. There are a few small hikes to the historic limekilns and a significant waterfall (be prepared to cross the creek a few times to get to the waterfall, but it's so worth it in the spring)."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Lucia Lodge"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.lucialodge.com"],["email="],["address=62400 Highway 1"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 831-667-2456"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content= Coastal cabins with great views of the coastline ranging in price and privacy."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Post Ranch Inn"]},", Highway 1 (2 miles south of Big Sur Village), 888-524-4787 or 831-667-2200, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.postranchinn.com"]},".

Also, fill your gas tank before you drive to the area, as gas stations are few, and some charge as much as $7 a gallon! It is also highly advisable to buy bottled water or replenish your supply from good tap water (the tap water in Big Sur Village, for example, which is delicious mountain spring water) when you have the chance, and try to avoid being caught having to drive long distances after dark with the fog rolling over the highway. Big Sur is very wild country for long stretches. A sign that might exemplify this for you is one that appears on Route 1 southbound, showing curves, with the text \"Next 72 miles\"!\n\nAlways check traffic conditions as the highway is a single lane on each side and land slides can cause major hold ups with construction reducing the roadway to a single lane, controlled by a light.
