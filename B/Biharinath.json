It is 451 m (1,480 ft) high.\n\nIt is a place where one can take a break from drudgery and daily monotonous job and simply rejuvenate one's mind and soul. It is part of the wonderful Rarh countryside.\n\nThe tourist spot is located at the foot of the hill, near Biharinath temple. There are small villages in the area. Saltora and Tiluri are comparatively more populous places.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nBiharinath is 16km from Madhukunda, a railway station on the Asansol-Adra track and off the Saltora-Madhukunda road. \n\nOne can travel by road from Raniganj via Saltora or across the Damodar River over the bridge near Dishergarh\/ Sanctoria, travel a little towards Raghunathpur and turn left for the road to Madhukunda and then on to Biharinath.\n\nGenerally, road transport is not available for travel from Madhukunda railway station. It is better to hire a car for both-ways travel from either Raniganj or Asansol. Rates are negotiable. Taxi drivers quote rather high to start with. Be a hard bargainer!\n\nOne can also drive down from Kolkata to Biharinath. It will take approximately 5-6 hours. The route (around 260 km) is Kolkata > Dankuni > Bardhaman (NH 2 by passes the town area) > Durgapur > Raniganj (till here  NH2) > Saltora> Biharinath. The drive down NH2 is a driving pleasure, but then once you are on the rural track, the drive through has its own charm.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nWalk or have your own transport.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name= Biharinath Parbat"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat= 23.5747"],["long= 86.9431"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content= You can climb, take along a local guide (tip him) in order that you are not lost"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name= Biharinath Temple"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat= 23.5810"],["long= 86.9489"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content= Ancient Jain temple"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name= Temple of Lord Shiva"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Hills and forests all around"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name= Enjoy mesmerising nature"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name= Bamantora village"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat= 23.6022"],["long= 86.9481"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content= Nearby viilage with a high school.
