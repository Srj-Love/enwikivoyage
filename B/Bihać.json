Ever since the ancient times, geographic position and favorable climate conditions have been suitable for settling in this region. Although the research based upon excavations and numerous remains has been done recently, it revealed the presence of men in the Older Stone Age, Late Bronze Age, Late and Early Iron Age. Presence of the Japodes tribe in this area has certainly been proved. The Japodes culture marked Bihać by its extraordinary values and ancient inheritance. It began with the building solutions for the houses on stilts, jewelry made of bronze, iron, silver and the “Japodes horseman”. The archeological findings from many places like Bihać, Golubić, Pritoka and Ripač indicate the specific characteristics of the Illyrian culture in the Japodes area.\n\nThe Una River has defined Bihać, the city and municipality for centuries. The waterfalls in Štrbački buk and Martinbrod are widely known. A valley near the Una headwaters, and a valley near the Unac River are announced the National Park in 2008.
