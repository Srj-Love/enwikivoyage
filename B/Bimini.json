Much of the historical data about these places is speculative in nature, and experts in various fields have opined across the full spectrum of explanation. Also, during the period of Prohibition in the United States, Bimini was a favourite haven and supply point for the rum-running trade. Some claim that the term \"the real McCoy\" was applied to the rum provided by William S. McCoy, who used Bimini to transport whiskey to America during the Prohibition. \n\nAnother interesting fact is that Bimini was a common travel destination for Hemingway. In fact, its said that his love of Bimini inspired him to write The Old Man and The Sea, as well as Islands in The Stream.\n\nIn the 1920s Bimini shipped tons of liquor to a \"dry\" America during the prohibition against strong drink.\n\nIt is also rumoured that the Fountain of Youth, which was searched for by Juan Ponce de Le√≥n, is said to exist within the shallow pools of South Bimini. And that the Lost City of Atlantis is believed to be in the shallow waters off of Bimini where divers can observe the Bimini Stones. Many people believe that the Bimini Stones may have been a road into Atlantis.\n\nBimini has remained relatively unchanged over the years and is a very quiet and peaceful place to live or stay. Its population is a bit over 1,600 and Biminites are friendly and welcome you to join them for conversation.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nBimini is a tropical destination with pleasant temperatures around the year. The summer months are warmer with calm seas, while winters on Bimini are a bit cooler with some ocean breeze. Mid-winter temperatures on Bimini can be cool at times. There is a rainy season on Bimini with occasional rainfall and rare hurricanes from July to October.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\nBeing such a small island, besides the main town of Alice Town, there aren't many other destinations on the island.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nLocated only 40 miles from Florida, the closest to the united states, it is an easy topical destination for Americans and Canadians.\n\nIf you land at the airport you take a \"taxi\" to the ferry which take five minutes to North Bimini and costs $5 total for both. United Airlines serve Bimini, flying in to the airport on South Bimini.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nNorth Bimini is crossed by two small paved roads which run the length of the 7-mile long island. A bicycle or golf cart is all you need to get around if you really need to go any where.  The main road is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Kings Highway"]}," where most shops, hotels and restaurants are located. The smaller ",{"type":"'''","value":["Queen's Highway"]}," follows the east coast and is where the beaches are located.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nBimini's fame comes from Hemingway and fishing. Hemingway spent a few seasons in Bimini fishing and writing 'To Have and To Have Not' and later based his novel 'Islands in the Stream' here. A small Hemingway museum and sign marking his time on the island were destroyed by fire in 2006 along with the Compleat Angler Hotel where he once stayed.\n\nThe Bimini Museum has a very interesting collection of artifacts and exhibits on the island's history. The museum is located in Alice Town on the southern end of main road (the Kings Highway).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nThe economic fuel of Bimini comes from deep sea fishing and the island is known as the \"Deep Sea Fishing Capital of the World.\" The storied past can be seen in the many black and white photos of record catches around the island, but commercial overfishing has greatly reduced the big game. The seasons in Bimini are opposite the normal Bahamas with tourists flocking from April - July to take advantage of the calm seas for fishing and diving. Wealthy Floridians make the short trip to the island in their yachts creating a fairly lively party scene. \n\nSince Bimini is close to Miami, many American travellers go to the island by boat to fish or to enjoy the local nightlife. Scuba diving and snorkelling are also popular activities, as there are many shipwrecks in the area, such as the wreck of the SS Sapona, which ran aground in 1926 during a hurricane.\n\nBars outnumber restaurants in Bimini two to one and a large liquor store occupies a choice location in the harbour. The weather is hot in the summer with afternoon thunder showers and warm and windy in the winter months. If you are not there to fish other activities include bone fishing, scuba diving, boating and relaxing. Bimini has several small beaches, but it is not a 'beach island'\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Bimini Big Game Resort & Marina"]},", Kings Highway.
