It came into being as a strategically important to the Romans.  Bingen was the home of one of the most incredible women in history, Hildegard von Bingen.  It was here on the northern banks of the Nahe, that the Benedictine Hildegard von Bingen (1098-1179) founded her cloister upon the grave of the holy Rupertus. It is remarkable to note that in her \"Physica\", Hildegard von Bingen includes more than 250 plants and many folk remedies and \"natural\" medicinal methods of treatment.  A scholar, artist, and composer (you can get CD's of her music at most major music stores), she was one of the most dominant and influential women of the Middle Ages (if she had been a man, she would have rivaled the Pope in influence).  The Historisches Museum am Strom (Museumsstr 3 Ph: 06721 990654) has an impressive display on her or you can also visit the Hildegard Forum (Ph: 06721 181000), which has additional displays on Hildegard, including a restaurant that serves foods reflecting her nutritional teachings.  \n\nFor bike riders, Bingen is the starting point of the Radweg Nahe, a 37 mile posted bike route that follows the Nahe River southwest to the town of Kirn.  Bingen is also the site of an eleven-day festival every September, when the city hosts the Winzerfest.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Train: Frankfurt – Mainz – Bingen Stadt – Bingen Hauptbahnhof – Koblenz – Köln ",{"type":"''","value":["(Cologne)"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.bingen-ruedesheimer.com\/rhine-cruise\/index.html Boat"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.bingen-ruedesheimer.com\/rheinfaehren\/index.html Ferry Rüdesheim – Bingen"]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Bingen Nahemündung 213-dh.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["River ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rhine"]]}," and Nahe, and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rheingau"]]}]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Mäuseturm ",{"type":"''","value":["(Mouse Tower)"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" Burg Klopp"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Historisches Museum am Strom - Hildegard von Bingen"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Parks "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Kulturufer Bingen – Very nice view to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rüdesheim"]]}," with the Niederwalddenkmal and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rheingau"]]},"."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":[" Hafenpark"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":[" Hindenburgpark"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":[" Rhein-Nahe-Eck − Museum am Strom, Hildegarten"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":[" Park am Mäuseturm in Bingerbrück"]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Events "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Internationales Jazzfestival \"Bingen swingt\" – Fr. 27.06 – So. 29.06.2014"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Rhine in Flames – Experience seven magnificent firework displays, \"burning\" castles and an impressive illuminated fleet of more than fifty ships in the romantic Rhine valley. – Sa. 7 July 2014 "]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Burg Rheinstein Trechtingshausen 010-Lh.jpg"],["thumb"],["220px"],["Burg Rheinstein near Trechtingshausen"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bacharach"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bad Kreuznach"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ingelheim"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mainz"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rüdesheim"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["49.966944"],["7.895000"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Rhenish Hesse"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Bingen_am_Rhein"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Europe\/Germany\/States\/Rhineland-Palatinate\/Localities\/Bingen"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Bingen am Rhein"]]}]
