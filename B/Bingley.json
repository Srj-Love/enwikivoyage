As the name suggests, a canal boat passing through the hinged gates of the lock is lifted or lowered in five stages. The Five-Rise is notable as the steepest flight of locks in the UK, with a gradient of about 1:5 (a rise of over 59 feet, or 18 metres) over a distance of 320 feet \/ 98 metres. The intermediate and bottom gates are also the tallest in the country. The Five-Rise Locks is a major tourist attraction in the Aire Valley and the town of Bingley. Boats that pass through attract a lot of attention, especially at weekends when large crowds may be attracted to watch the locks in operation."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Leeds and Liverpool Canal"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.penninewaterways.co.uk\/ll\/ll36.htm"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Take a walk along the banks of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, an impressive relic of the Industrial Age—still in daily use by canal boats—and early modern engineering feat.
