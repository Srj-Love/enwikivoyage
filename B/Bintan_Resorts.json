It is commonly misunderstood as a colony of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Singapore"]]}," because of its higher standards in infrastructures, utilities and security. Very much a family-oriented destination, there are currently five independently owned and operated beach resorts, four designer golf courses as well as a range of recreational facilities and attractions located within it. Most tourists come for its serene characteristic, where they can laze by the beach, enjoy spa, play golf and dabble in watersports. The area is separated from the rest of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bintan"]]}," by thick forests and checkpoints.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nBahasa Indonesia and English are widely understood. However, if you plan to rent a car to visit towns outside the resort area, bring along your Bahasa Indonesia Phrase Book because the drivers' command of English can be limited.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nBintan has a small domestic airport and three international seaports. However, most travellers to Bintan Resorts arrive at Bandar Bentan Telani (BBT) at the western tip of the Bintan Resorts from Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal (TMFT) in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Singapore"]]},". The trip takes about 45 minutes and ticket can be booked at Bintan Resort Ferries ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.brf.com.sg\/"]}," or as part of a room package.\n\nVisitors form other parts of Indonesia may either fly to Hang Nadim airport in Batam and take 25-minute boat ride to BBT or to Raja Haji Fisabillilah in Kijang and drive for 1.5 hours. The travel time will be shortened with the new Bintan International Airport, a 30-minute drive from Bintan Resorts, that is scheduled to open in 2015.\n\nVisitors from ASEAN countries, Chile, Ecuador, Morocco, Hong Kong, Macau and Peru do not require visa to enter Indonesia. Visa on arrival (VOA) can be obtained at BBT or onboard of ferry if you are on Emerald Class for the citizens of Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Fiji, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Iran, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Kuwait, Latvia, Libya, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Maldives, Malta, Mexico, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Oman, Panama, People's Republic of China, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Suriname, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Timor Leste, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom and United States of America\n\n7-day VOA costs USD10 and 30-day USD25. USD and SGD currencies are accepted but not credit cards. It is worth obtaining USD notes for VOA payment before you leave the Singapore side.\n\nBest way to plan the trip is thru holiday packages and vacation club membership offers. These comes in various plans and durations. Longer the time, better the price ratio, in term of per trip and per person basis.

The limited means to get around Bintan Resorts and the nearby towns push up the price of vehicle rental.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nAs a destination, Bintan Resorts is rather artificial with its manicured landscape. Still, the beaches are beautiful with white sands and most of the resorts are built to a high standard.\n\nHowever, do not solely devote your entire vacation to the beach and golf. You can book various eco-tours by contacting brctours@bintan-resorts.com. The PATA Gold Winner's Mangrove Tour and Firefly Night Tour are the most attractive choices. A day pass with unlimited rides from your resort to Pasar Oleh-Oleh at Kota Sebung costs SGD3 for child and SGD5 for adult.

This is good for surfing and bodyboarding, but not good for most anything else. The north facing beach break at the resort Mayang Sari, even with fresh onshore winds in April, does not generate more than 1 to 1.5 foot waves. The waves tend to close out, however it is a good beach for children on boogie boards or surfmats. Small jellyfish may be found.\n\nSpas are increasing in number and quality in Pasar Oleh Oleh, with prices a little below that in Singapore.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nIn Bintan Resorts, both Singapore Dollars and Indonesian Rupiah are accepted, though prices are usually quoted in Singapore Dollars. At most F&B establishments, prices in the menu have not included 10% tax and 10% service charge. Prices in Bintan Resorts are generally expensive compared to Singapore, and very expensive compared to almost anywhere else in Indonesia.
