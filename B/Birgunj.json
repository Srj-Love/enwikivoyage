Buses leave 6AM-10AM, then 7PM-10PM, with a 'deluxe' bus leaving daily at 7PM. Sumo's\/Jeeps's can usually be taken from 6AM-3PM, and cost Rs 500 NPR per person in a ten person shared Jeep, or Rs. 6000 NPR for a whole private jeep to yourself or your travelling companions. To get either a bus or jeep, you'll need to go to the bus station, which is located just off the main road. Keep going north (3 km from the border) until you reach a large tower in the middle of a round-a-bout. Take a right hand turn and the bus stop is 50m down that road. While it's little more than a dirt patch in the north of town, you'll know you got there as there are always plenty of buses parked. A cycle rickshaw should be about NPR 80 for the distance. Jeeps leave when full, from near the road (not towards the back of the bus stop) so expect to wait up to an hour.\n\nFor information to cross the border into India, you may find the information under 'Get out' under ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Raxaul"]]}," useful.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["27.0000"],["84.8667"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Eastern_Tarai"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Birganj"]]}]
