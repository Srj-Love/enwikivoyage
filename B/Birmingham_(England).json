This led to a massive canal network, with more miles of canals than Venice or Amsterdam (though they're very different types of canal).\n\nMuch of the city centre was destroyed during the Second World War, and the replacement buildings added little to the city. However, since the 1990s, Birmingham has been undergoing a radical change and many of the post war buildings have been replaced. The majority of the city centre is now pedestrianised, and the canals cleaned up to make for attractive walkways. Locals credit the City Council for the recent transformation, as the city retains its industrial heritage while now appearing modern and forward looking.\n\nThe city's notable associations are as diverse as HP Sauce, Tony Hancock, Cadbury's chocolate, The Lunar Society (whose members included James Watt and Matthew Boulton), Black Sabbath, UB40, Jasper Carrot and the Spitfire and the Mini (car, not skirt).\n\nBirmingham has many literary associations - not only JRR Tolkien, but also Washington Irving, who wrote Rip Van Winkle while lodging here with his sister's family, and Conan Doyle, who bought a violin in Sherlock Street while a medical student in Birmingham. The authors Jim Crace, Judith Cutler and David Lodge are also residents.\n\nThe nearby locations of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shropshire"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Warwick (England)"],["Warwick"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Stratford-Upon-Avon"]]}," provide more of the stereotypical images of \"olde\"  ",{"type":"[[","value":[["England"]]},".

As a result, the City Council is the largest regional body in the EU, with 120 councillors representing 10 so-called constituencies (districts), further divided into 40 wards. Therefore, even if a point of interest is officially in Birmingham, it can be located quite far away from the actual city centre, in what can appear a separate small town or even countryside. Addresses are often given including the name of ward or consitutency to help locate them. Do not assume than any place with a Birmingham address is easily accessible once you are in the city.\n\nSome of the more known districts and wards of Birmingham include Aston (home to the Aston Hall and Aston Villa football team) Edgbaston (where the main campus of University of Birmingham is located), Longbridge (with the MG factory) and Selly Oak (secondary campus and student town). The city centre of Birmingham officially falls into the ward of Ladywood, which itself has little to do with the actual centre.\n\nThe centre of Birmingham is confined by a motorway ringroad officially called A4540, also called the ",{"type":"''","value":["Middle Ring Road"]},". There was also the ",{"type":"''","value":["Inner Ring Road"]},", or rod 4400, which was viewed as an urban planning failure and parts of it were dismantled and redeveloped. The extant part is now road A38 and runs across the city centre, partially underground. The very central point of Birmingham is arguably marked by the huge New Street railway station, with tracks leading to it bisecting the centre. Next to the New Street station is the huge Bullring shopping centre, which is also an orientation beacon and leads up all the way to another railway station called Moor Street.\n\nThe Birmingham city centre can be divided into several areas of different characteristics:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Core City Centre"]}," - extends northwestwards of the New Street station, inside the confines of the A38 and includes much of the surviving pre-war historic buildings of Birmingham, a number of important institutions and the historically prime addresses such as New Street or Colmore Row"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Westside"]}," - extend southwest of New Street and beyond the former Inner Ringroad, and includes much of the remaining canals in central Birmingham.

The City Centre is around a 5 minute walk from the station along the slightly tatty Digbeth High Street, but people need not be alarmed as the Selfridges Building and skyline are clearly visible to guide you in the correct direction.

From the ICC, you walk east by the Repertory Theatre and Library of Birmingham in Centenary Square; then through the Paradise Forum to Chamberlain Square; with the Museum and Art Gallery to your left and the Class I listed building, the Town Hall, on your right, you make your way to the spacious Victoria Square. At Victoria Square, you will find the Town Hall to the west, the Council Offices to the north, and the Post Office to the South; the path you want to the Bull Ring is east, down New Street, which is a pedestrianized street lined with shops, stores, and kiosks. About five blocks down New Street, you will come to a signal at Corporation Street, the only road crossing you need to make on this walk. A few blocks later, New Street will turn into Rotunda Square.

The standard of driving is as bad as in other cities, so exercise extreme caution on main roads and at night. The canal network can be accessed in the city centre from the Broad Street\/Gas Street area, or at most road crossings elsewhere.

However, like most large cities, there are some good and bad areas. Certain suburbs (see below) have had their share of gun crime problems, but these are extremely unlikely to affect you unless you make yourself part of the larger drug gang problem. Avoid any offers of cheap drugs as you might be lured into a secluded place and then robbed.\n\nMuggers in Birmingham tend to operate in groups of two or three, typically one will ask you a question (to judge whether you are local or likely to hit back) while the others move in behind you so they can force you to the ground. If you find this happening to you, then move to the side, so you have a clear escape path and cannot be grabbed from the rear.\n\nThe city centre is well-policed. The only trouble you might witness is a small scuffle on the Broad Street nightlife quarter as the nightclubs turn out in the early hours of the morning. However, take care at either end of Broad Street where the traffic flow speeds up.\n0\nIt is advisable to stay away from the city centre when football matches between the city's two professional teams occur. Aston Villa and Birmingham City have a violent and raw hatred for each other, and violent clashes between supporters of both teams are a common occurrence on match days. On other days, when the teams are playing at home against other teams, it is a little less unlikely for major violence to occur in the city centre, but you may encounter pubs full of chanting football supporters, and this may be intimidating (and really annoying) for tourists.\n\nAs usual, common sense will keep you safe, avoid walking alone in deserted or poorly-lit areas, especially at night, keep your wits about you at cash machines, and do not get into unmarked taxis. Private hire cars must be pre-booked; black cabs may be hailed. The only higher crime-rate areas that tourists might want to visit are ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Aston"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sparkbrook"]]},": even these are fairly safe during daylight. Canal towpaths at night, if relatively near a road access point, can also be hazardous.\n\nBirmingham, like many other large cities, has relatively high incidences of STDs compared to the rest of the UK. Having unprotected sex is very dangerous.\n\nAvoid people in New Street, near the junction with Ethel Street, who offer you a free \"stress test\" as they are trying to recruit you into the Church of Scientology.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["City Hospital (A&E)"]},", Dudley Rd (",{"type":"''","value":["#80, #82 or #87 bus"]},"), ",{"type":"''","value":["+44 121"]}," 554 3801.
