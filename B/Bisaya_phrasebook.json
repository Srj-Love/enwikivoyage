[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Welcome banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Bisaya"]}," is a dialect of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Filipino phrasebook"],["Filipino"]]}," language which is spoken mostly in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Visayas"]]}," region and some parts of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mindanao"]]},".  Lots of variations of this dialect exist, like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cebuano phrasebook"],["Cebuano"]]}," which is mainly spoken on the islands ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cebu (island)"],["Cebu"]]},".

Instead, formal speech is used.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Difficulties"]},"\nBesides the local dialect, most people in the Philippines speak English with an accent.  They mostly speak Tagalog too, as it's being taught in all schools from the first grade onwards.  The accent depends on the social class.\n\nGenerally, people with a low socioeconomic status from rural areas like farms, small towns, markets, etc. speak very basic conversational English with a heavy accent.  They generally don't respond well to English at all and probably don't even understand it when spoken to as they are not used to ",{"type":"''","value":["American"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["British"]},", etc. accents.  In this case, some Bisayan phrases can be useful.  They might treat you with ridicule because of pronunciation and the fact that a tourist\/foreigner speaks their language.\n\nMost people with a higher socioeconomic status, like those living in cities understand and speak good conversational English with a slight accent.  For example, college professors, lawyers, politicians, journalists, businessmen, doctors, etc.  Most employees working at chain restaurants like ",{"type":"[[","value":[[":Wikipedia:Pizza Hut"],["Pizza Hut"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[[":Wikipedia:McDonald's"],["McDonald's"]]},", coffee shops like ",{"type":"[[","value":[[":Wikipedia:Starbucks"],["Starbucks"]]},", hotels, major shopping malls, etc. have been trained to engage in conversation with tourists.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Pronunciation guide"]},"\nMost of the words are pronounced the same way as Cebuano.
