Many young travelers find Bishkek's nightlife a delight and the people are friendly and very hospitable. Bishkek is a city of many young people that hang out in Clubs and small cafes.

For non-Kazakh\/Kyrgyz nationals, you'll need to walk into the Kyrgyz immigration building and knock on the mirrored window door on the left as you enter to get the attention of the officer to come and take your passports for processing. He will disappear for 5 minutes and re-emerge with your stamped passports, you then go on through to meet your minibus.\n\nYou can also share or rent an entire taxi from Almaty.

The Bishkek-Osh highway is a narrow mountainous road in a good condition, and big buses or public passenger minivans are not allowed to cross the Tor-Ashu and Ala-Bel Passes.

You better start in the morning, not to miss the great view along the road. Try to reserve the front seat, even by paying a hundred soms more, because the driver will squeeze 3 passengers in the back seat. In 2012 the price was 1000-1500 soms per person. A more comfortable overnight option is the cargo-passenger minivan ('busik', ‘бусик’) from Kara-Su market, which is located 30 km from the center of Osh. Shared vans or taxis between Kara-Su and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Osh"]]}," are frequent and cost 30-40 soms. In Bishkek, the minivans arrive at the Dordoi Bazaar. The price is only 500-700 soms, they have comfortable sleeping bunks, but windows are small and you will pass most beautiful scenery in the night. Minivans depart daily between 15:00 and 18:00. You don't have to book seats in advance: just come there and choose the car and the driver you like.\n\nIn reverse direction it's similar. Take a shared taxi to Bishkek from taxi stand near the Bazaar in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Osh"]]},". They leave as they fill up. Or go to Kara-Su market to catch a cargo-passenger minivan to Bishkek. It is also possible to buy a seat from a truck for about 500. The truck leave the bazaar in Osh daily at 15:00.\n\nTruly adventuresome travellers may want to attempt to get to Bishkek via the Chinese\/Kyrgyz frontier crossing over the Torugart Pass.

The pass tops off at a height of 3,752 metres and is known as one of the most frustrating passes in Central Asia, as both sides can be closed for holidays, early snowfall, or for other. unknown reasons.

It is highly recommended against taking an unaccompanied stroll after dusk and you definitely avoid parks at night.\n\nPickpockets are a major problem in and around markets, especially at Osh Bazaar. Look out for young men with large plastic bags \"bumping\" into you. Keep your valuables at your accommodation if you plan to visit the markets, and if you bring a purse, camera, backpack etc. keep it in front of you.\n\nNightclubs and their surrounding areas can be a hotbed for crime in the form of theft, prostitution, or even assault by people waiting to take advantage of an unsuspecting traveler or expat. Ask locals or hotel staff which areas are safer than other and take precautions if you plan on club hopping. Do not walk from nightclub to nightclub at night; instead spend 100 som ($US2.50) on a taxi. Potential muggers have been known to wait outside bars and clubs, especially the ones frequented by ex-pats, follow drunk ex-pats and then rob them.\n\nKeep a cool head and be aware of your surroundings when hanging out inside and outside of nightclubs. Most clubs have numerous buff, semi-professional security guards, but you should be vigilant nonetheless. Do not leave any belongings on the table while you go to dance. Be careful around the taxi area outside the club; occasionally, unsavory characters pick this location to mug drunk foreigners as they leave the club late at night. You might not get much help from club security when it comes to theft.\n\nBishkek has a large number of prostitutes and sexual-transmitted diseases are on the rise in Kyrgyzstan and Central Asia. Always take proper precautions if you plan on being sexually active.\n\nIf you are a victim of a crime, you are probably best served by reporting the incident to your embassy, rather than to the militsya (police). Sometimes militsya will approach foreigners and ask them for documents, such as your passport. It's best to keep a photocopy of your passport and leave the original at your hotel if you can. On the rare occasion they try to fine you for having \"the wrong visa\", you are most likely just being set up for a shake down. Be polite, but firm, in your refusal and insist that you be put in touch with your embassy first.\n\nSometimes policeman approach you on the street, especially if you look like a tourist, such as carrying a big backpack, and ask to check the belongings. Often, their aim is to steal your valuables and money. They can do it very professionally, and you only will notice later, that something disappeared. The best way, is to pretend you don't understand them, trying to call your embassy, or just walk away asap. Also keep your valuables in a safe place and don't expose them to others all the time in Kyrgyzstan. Even sometimes normal local people, who invite you to have a tea at their home, if they see that you left some valuables unattended, may be tempted to steal.\n\nIrrigation ditches and other holes in the ground can seriously injure the unaware person - especially when walking at night. Many streets are poorly lit or not lit at all, and it is easy to fall into them. Avoid manhole covers, grates and similar fixtures - they are frequently loose and even missing.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n\nBishkek is the Eastern Europe of 30 years ago, except with mobile phones and internet access. It is more or less a museum relic of the former Soviet Union Bloc. Despite Kyrgyzstan's poverty and the decay of its infrastructure, Bishkek remains a relatively safe, clean, functional city. Bishkek is not an old city and possesses no ancient landmarks, but it nonetheless has its own kind of charm, which often arouses nostalgia in people who knew the old Soviet Union. For some visitors, Bishkek is merely a stop on the Silk Road to refresh supplies before returning to the mountains. However, expatriates who call Bishkek home generally consider themselves lucky to benefit from its easygoing lifestyle, open-minded spirit, party culture and low cost of living.
