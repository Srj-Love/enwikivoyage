The three bouldering areas that are near the town of Bishop, the Happy Boulders, the Sad Boulders, and The Buttermilk Country.\n\nThe Happy Boulders contains over 450 established boulder problems, ranging from VB to V10.  Some of the most classic and notable problems include The Hulk, Atari, and Action Figure.  The Happy Boulders are located in a narrow canyon.  The climbing is done, primarily on freestanding boulders within the canyon, but there are also many amazing problems along the rim of the canyon.  There are many different varieties of problems, with everything from slabs to roofs.  The rock is volcanic and highly featured.  The rock creates many positive holds, ranging from large flakes to small pockets and everything in between. They are approximately five miles north of the town of Bishop.  The only way to access the bouldering area is by driving down chalk bluff road.  There is a parking area, and then a short five to ten minute hike into the area.\n\nThe Sad Boulders area is located quite close to the Happy Boulders, and is accessed from the same road, Chalk Bluff rd.  The Sad Boulders is becoming a much more developed area, with many great problems being established.\n\nThe Buttermilks boulder area can be broken into two areas The Pollen Grains and The Peabodys.  The Pollen Grains is a collection of approximately 20 free standing boulders.  There are many high-ball problems at varying difficulties.  There are over 60 problems in total, ranging from VB to V9.  Some of the classic problems include Suspended in Silence, The Beekeepers Apprentice, and Jedi Mind Tricks.  The Peabodys is a much larger bouldering area, and for that reason a much higher traffic area.  The area has over 300 problems, ranging from VB to V12.  Some of the classics include the Iron Man Traverse, Soul Slinger, and Hero Roof.  One of the most interesting, if not classic problems is an unrated problem on the womb boulder known as A Birthing Experience.  You really have to see it worked to understand.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["buy"],["name=Mountain Light Studio"],["url=http:\/\/www.mountainlight.com"],["email=gallery@mountainlight.com"],["address=106 South Main St."],["lat=37.361312"],["long=-118.395074"],["directions=at Line Street"],["phone=+1 760 873-7700"],["tollfree="],["fax=+1 760 873-3233"],["hours=Su-Th 10AM-6PM, F Sa 10AM-8PM"],["price="],["content=Renowned mountain photographers, the late Galen and Barbara Rowell’s famous Mountain Light studio is located at the center of Bishop.
