While not particularly high, the mountains offer a wonderful place to go hiking or mountain biking. There are a few skiing resorts as well offering average but crowded conditions. Better to head south to the alps if you are a serious skier or boarder.\nThe Black Forest is a mountainous terrain at about 200 - 1500 meters above sea level, the highest point being the ",{"type":"''","value":["Feldberg"]}," (the ",{"type":"''","value":["field mountain"]},") at 1493 m. \n\nThe region is famous for its cuckoo clocks, watchmaking, skiing and tourism. There is a large high-tech light engineering industry in the region stemming from the gold-mining and watchmaking days. Almost all tourists are from Germany and Switzerland; the region's tourist industry is therefore not well equipped to deal with guests who don't speak German.\n\nThe most important destination in the ",{"type":"''","value":["Schwarzwald"]}," is called, interestingly, ",{"type":"''","value":["Titisee"]},", which is a medium-sized lake with associated tourist village (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Titisee-Neustadt"]]},") and hotels, with very nice views and generally very relaxed and healthy activities.

For a nice hut at a reasonable price, look for a privately-operated Gasthaus, which can be found in villages throughout the area. There are many pleasant surprises waiting, often with excellent home-cooked food and special service, often provided by the family living there for many generations. Ask at the local Tourist Bureau for a list, often with prices. Sometimes the Tourist office will even call to ask availability. Gasthaus rooms may be found for as low as €20 for one person, up to €70 for a double room\/two persons. Reservations may be needed during festivals or summer near tourist locations.\n\nMid-price Hotels begin at €50-100 a night per double room, with lots of availability in the mid and expensive categories. Eating out in nice restaurants can be expensive, with a meal for two cost ranging from €50 to €150 including drinks. But bargains can be found, with many Kebab and Turkish-style pizzerias offering items under €5. Or shop at the local grocery store for fresh baguettes, meat, and cheese. Groceries are inexpensive, with a variety of fruit juices available at a reasonable price (We found cherry, apple, grape, orange, banana, even sauerkraut juice in nice tetrapak containers, a liter is under €1). In the south Schwarzwald, look for stores Lidl, Aldi, and Pennymarkt for the best food values.\n\nThe Black Forest area has some of the best hiking options, with well-marked trails, and maps available from the tourist offices. Some Germans even spend a week or two hiking with their backpack, with primitive lodging available in small cabins along the trails (must be reserved in advance through the Forestamt office).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Bertha Benz Memorial Route"]]}]}," - follow the tracks of the world's first return car journey back in 1888 from Pforzheim in the Black Forest to Mannheim"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Schwaben cultural region"]]}]}," and enjoy some ",{"type":"''","value":["Spätzle"]}," egg noodles in this picturesque adjoining region that joins Baden-Württemberg with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bavaria"]]},"."]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Baden-Württemberg"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["48.22650"],["8.27820"],["zoom=9"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["extraregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Black Forest"]]}]
