Due to the odd history of South Dakota, the forest service land is actually patchworked in and out with private land, state highways, forest service roads, and etc all through the area. \n\nWithin the federal land are several cities, such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Deadwood"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lead"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Custer"]]},". On the edge of the Black Hills are towns such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Spearfish"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hot Springs (South Dakota)"],["Hot Springs"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rapid City"]]},".\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Black Hills"]}," of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South Dakota"]]}," are a lone series of mountains in the middle of the Great Plains. The nearest rocky mountains, the Bighorn Mountains, are about one hundred miles to the west. The nearest mountains to the east or south are several thousand miles away. It was formed by unknown means when some kind of 'uplift' occurred many millions of years ago. \n\nThe Black Hills are possibly named black because of the Ponderosa Pine trees that grow there; young trees have black bark that turns orange as the trees mature. \n\nThe Black Hills are sacred to Lakota people and were a refuge during harsh seasons on the plains. The hills unique ecosystem also provided many plants not found on the prairies that could be used for foodmaking or medicine. Nowadays the Lakota live mostly on the Pine Ridge Indian reservation a few miles to the south. \n\nThe Hills unique formation of limestone rocks being shifted by the 'uplift', and then eroded and deposited-upon by water, make wonderful conditions for caves to form, and the area is dotted with many that you can visit. The federal government has taken over two of these via the National Park Service; Wind Cave and Jewel Cave. You can go on guided tours through these. There are several commercial caves owned privately by companies that also give tours. \n\nTourism is a big business in the Black Hills. In summer the temperatures rise and tourists flood in for a variety of reasons. Thus there are many touristy type shops, restaurants, casinos and so forth usually with a western theme, banking on the 'Wild West' image of Deadwood and the surrounding area. \n\nThere are also lots of mountain climbers, and therefore several mountain climbing schools and equipment supply shops. Devil's Tower which is a famous climbing destination lies a few hours to the West of the area in Wyoming. \n\nThe hills are mostly populated lower income white people, farmers and ranchers, and Indians, but in recent years lots of people from California, driven out by high land prices, have invaded the area. Many of the old citizens have sold their land to incoming Californians for a good price and have moved farther from the Hills.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\nThe Black Hills stand in contrast to the wide sweeping prairies of western South Dakota, as they are covered with mostly Ponderosa\nor Lodgepole Pine.

Several trails can be taken to the top which has an old CCC fire lookout tower at the summit.  \nIn the southern hills, trees are sparse, and prairie grasses prevail.  This is also where most of the larger cave systems are located, such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wind Cave National Park"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jewel Cave National Monument"]]},".  \n\nMinerals of many types are found in abundance throughout the Black Hills, commonly found is:  Granite, muscovite, and quartz.
