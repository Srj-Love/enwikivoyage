Old US-70, barricaded for 3 miles just past Ridgecrest, is a hike or bike down a road closed for 50 years. It runs above the RR tracks, includes great views including some of the RR tunnels, and is just really interesting to see what Mother Nature has done to reclaim road, pavement, and concrete over half a century.
