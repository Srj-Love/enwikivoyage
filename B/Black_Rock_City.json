At its maximum occupancy, the town has about 60,000 citizens and a post office, an emergency services crew, a volunteer police department, roads, houses, bars, clubs, restaurants, and hundreds of art installations and participatory \"theme camps\". After a week, the city is completely disassembled – much of it burned – leaving the stark, white desert exactly as bare as it had been when the event started.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Burning Man festival"]}," is an annual event started in San Francisco in 1986 and moved to the harsh and unforgiving Black Rock Desert of Nevada in 1990, where it continues today. The event happens each year in late August and early September, during the week before Labor Day weekend and over the weekend itself. Around 50,000 artists, partiers and eccentrics converge on the desert location – otherwise empty throughout the year – to create a temporary city on the desert lake bed (",{"type":"'''","value":["\"The Playa\""]},"). The event culminates on Saturday night when the event's eponymous mascot – an 80-foot-tall anthropomorphic statue known affectionately as ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Man"]}," – is set on fire in a huge bacchanalian party.\n\nThe Burning Man community, although widespread and anarchic, has some guiding principles (codified and exemplified in catch phrases) that make the event manageable and possible. First and foremost is the concept of \"self-sufficiency\". With few exceptions (see ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Black Rock City#Buy"],["Buy"]]}," below), there is \"No Vending\" of any kind in Black Rock City. Attendees are expected to bring along all their own food, water, shelter and any other supplies they need to live in the desert during the week. Most attendees are helpful and generous, but travellers should do as much research as possible before leaving for the desert in order to be ready.\n\nAn extension of this principle is the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["leave-no-trace camping"],["Leave No Trace"]]}]}," policy; all attendees are expected to clean up any and all trash they create, including burned material, cigarette butts, sawdust or peanut shells. In previous years leftover detritus at the site of the event has caused alarm for the federal officials who provide the permits for it, and a strict policy of absolutely zero tolerance for leftover trash is needed to keep the event alive.\n\nBurning Man is organized by a small group of volunteers and paid employees of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Burning Man organization"]},", who deal with the local, state and federal officials in charge of the desert region, and who provide most of the infrastructure services such as emergency medical care and media relations. According to the principle of ",{"type":"'''","value":["No Spectators"]},", however, ",{"type":"''","value":["all"]}," Burning Man attendees are expected to ",{"type":"'''","value":["participate"]}," in some way: by making art, by doing performances, by doing volunteer work, or just by being freaks. The idea is that spectators feel no ownership – or the consequent responsibility – for the event, while participants will consider the event their own, and will act as responsibly as if they were throwing the party themselves. In fact, they are! There's some \"us vs. them\" feeling between participants and the \"Org\", but by and large the No Spectators concept ensures smooth operation and wide participation.  A \"burner\" is common title or descriptor for a participant of this event and this community.\n\nLastly, the community encourages ",{"type":"'''","value":["radical self-expression"]},". There's an \"anything goes\" atmosphere, pretty much only limited by legal and safety concerns as well as respect for other participants. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Nudity"]}," is widespread – although many participants will decorate their bodies with paint or ornaments. As a component of the \"anything goes\" atmosphere of personal freedom and personal choice, drug use is common, though generally discreet. Furthermore, out of respect for other participants and their individual choices, it would be very unusual for anyone attending the event to ever feel any pressure towards drug use whatsoever. Alcohol, however, is plentiful, and ",{"type":"'''","value":["free bars"]}," exist throughout the city. Fundamental elements of the festival are individual choice and personal freedom. Numerous art projects on the Playa have an element of danger; and the use of ",{"type":"'''","value":["fire"]}," in art is quite common, as well as explosives or other dangerous substances. Many participants speak later of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["life-changing"]}," nature of the Burning Man experience: that the experience of self-expression changes the way they look at the world.\n\nThe City itself is laid out in a circle – centering on the Man – about one and a half miles in diameter. The center of the circle is empty desert, punctuated by large art installations. Participants live on a series of 8-10 circular streets that ring the outer edge of the circle; about 20 radial streets cross these at various points. The inner 2-3 streets are reserved for registered ",{"type":"'''","value":["theme camps"]},": groups who build large structures and installations with a particularly \"interactive\" point. Theme camps are open to the public for investigation and use; a typical theme camp has 20-50 members, but some grow to hundreds of campers. Some groups of theme camps agglomerate into ",{"type":"'''","value":["villages"]},", which usually share an overarching meta-theme.\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["street names change"]}," each year, based on the ",{"type":"'''","value":["theme"]}," of that year's event. Combined with the fact that the city is torn down and rebuilt each year, so that different services and theme camps are located at wildly different places in the city, this makes for a lot of ",{"type":"'''","value":["disorientation"]}," and difficulty in finding friends and cohorts. Participants argue that this can make travelling around the City more adventurous; it definitely leads to serendipitous discoveries. The night of the annual burning of the Man, participants take away all existing street signs as souvenirs - much like matchbooks - making navigation even more confusing.\n\nSome things are constant, though, in an unofficial way. The radial streets are usually labeled according to clock time (e.g., \"10:00\" or \"4:30\"), and spaced about every half-hour. A large circular village known as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Center Camp"]}," is (almost always) located at 6:00 on the circle; most of the Burning Man organizations services are located here. Other villages are usually placed near 9:00 and 3:00. The innermost circular street – which looks out directly to the central desert area – is called ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Esplanade"]},"; most of the bigger theme camps line this street. And, of course, The Man is always dead in the center of the City, a convenient landmark.\n\nThe Black Rock Desert is an ",{"type":"''","value":["extremely"]}," harsh environment. Temperatures are regularly over 100°F, with no natural shade, and almost zero percent humidity. Hundreds of Burning Man participants are treated for dehydration every year; all attendees should drink about 4 liters of water per day, one of which has added electrolytes. More important survival information is available in the Burning Man Survival Guide ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.burningman.com\/preparation\/event_survival\/"]},", a copy of which is given to each participant.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nBlack Rock City is in the remote Black Rock Desert about 2–3 hours north of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Reno"]]},", Nevada. Most travellers arrive by car, bus, truck, RV, or other motor conveyance. From Reno, take Interstate 80 east to exit 43 (Wadworth), then highway 447 north about 100 miles to Gerlach. Head east (right) at the fork in the road north of Gerlach, and exit onto the Black Rock Desert after about 11 miles (signs should be posted). The festival requires all participants to hold tickets; they run about $240–420, and can be significantly cheaper if purchased early in the year.  Less expensive tickets are also made available through their Low Income program.\n\nAttendees from locations too far away from driving usually fly to Reno or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Francisco"]]}," and either rent cars or other vehicles there, or hook up with locals for rides. Rideshare boards are available on the Burning Man Web site.  There are special air shuttles offered this year through Advantage Flight Solutions ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/advantageflight.com\/specials.html"]}," from Reno and the Bay Area directly to the Black Rock desert for a reasonable price.\n\nThe Green Tortoise Bus Company ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.greentortoise.com"]}," runs a few bus tours from San Francisco to Black Rock City during the event; food, shelter, and transportation are all provided in the tour package.\n\nBlack Rock City creates its own airport ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.burningman.com\/on_the_playa\/airport\/"]}," (88NV) for small private planes, run by volunteers.  The field is a (very hard-packed) dry lake; most flying clubs do not allow non-emergency landings by rental planes on dirt fields.  Mountainous desert regions are ",{"type":"'''","value":["extremely dangerous"]}," for inexperienced and experienced pilots alike, and it's not recommended to fly into this airport unless you are experienced with desert flying.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nOnce participants have arrived in Black Rock City, they are expected to leave their cars or other motor vehicles parked and travel around the city under their own power. Cars should only be used in an emergency, or when leaving or entering the city. Law enforcement officials and the Black Rock Rangers will stop vehicles and may give you a ticket.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Bicycles"]}," are ",{"type":"''","value":["de rigueur"]}," for most BRC citizens; the alkali dust of the Playa causes severe damage to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["cycling"],["bikes"]]},", so bring a cheap one that you don't care much about. A good lock is also important; many bikes every year are \"accidentally\" borrowed and later abandoned, or stolen outright.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Walking"]}," is also a great way to get around; although slower, it's easier to stop and see the many sights if you don't have a big clunky bike to park, lock, unload, etc.\n\nRadically-altered motor vehicles called ",{"type":"'''","value":["art cars"]}," are an exception to the no-cars rule in BRC. These cars – or buses, or trucks, or what have you – must be permanently and creatively altered to qualify for the exemption. They must also be licensed by the Black Rock City DMV ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.burningman.com\/on_the_playa\/playa_vehicles\/dmv.html"]}," (Department of Mutant Vehicles), and if running at night must be extremely well-lit in order to prevent human-vehicle accidents.\n\nMany art cars have high passenger capacity and will pick up participants on the Playa for a ride, but don't expect or demand a ride from anyone. Use caution when boarding or disembarking from any moving vehicle on-playa. While all vehicles within the event's perimeter are required to drive slowly, this does not mean the vehicle is safe to leap from. In 2003, a participant died after falling from an art car.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nThe art installations and theme camps present at Burning Man change, sometimes radically, each year. Those listed below may or may not be present, or may be significantly altered. You can check the ",{"type":"''","value":["Who, When, Where"]}," guide – available at the Gate of Black Rock City or at the \"Playa Info\" tent in Center Camp – for locations of theme camps and other installations. (Note, though, that theme camps' descriptions are self-reported, and usually greatly exaggerate the interest-factor of the camp.)\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["The Man"]},", mathematical center of Black Rock City. First created in 1986 by Burning Man founder Larry Harvey, this is central art piece and symbol of the Burning Man event: a 50-foot-tall anthropomorphic wooden statue with a triangle-shaped head, mounted on a pedestal or stand that changes with each year's theme. The Man is lit by neon at night, and due to its location can be seen from most of Black Rock City. Usually you can climb up onto the pedestal and get a good view of the rest of the City from there, but ask the Black Rock Rangers at the Man before climbing up.

Since 2001, artist David Best has created monumental structures on the Playa in the form of 3- or 4-story temples. Although the design, name, and nominal purpose changes each year, the Temple is usually dedicated to lost friends and relatives. The Temple is a beautiful and meditative place to spend a few minutes during the day or night."]},"\nOther art can be seen in the central Playa area surrounding the Man.  Typically there are 40-50 art installations of various complexity and interactivity on the central Playa. Usually, a wandering path on bicycle or on foot can turn up any number of hidden treasures; ask other participants for this year's \"must see\" piece.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nBurning Man has a \"No Spectators\" philosophy so, theoretically, everyone should be \"Doing\" something most of the time. Many camps revolve around some participatory activity.

However, many artists, performers and participants bring ",{"type":"'''","value":["trinkets"]}," of various worth to the event – pins, stickers, buttons, clothes, jewelry, doodads and tchochkees – to gift to other people there. Stopping to talk with anyone at a theme camp or at an art installation will probably garner you a tchotchke of some kind. Bringing your own personalized trinkets, or commercial products like cans of beer or sticks of lip balm, to give away or trade can help grease the wheels when meeting new people.\n\nThere are a few places you ",{"type":"''","value":["can"]}," spend US tender, however. One is at the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Center Camp Cafe"]}," (see below) for coffee and other snacks. Another is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Camp Arctica"]}," (in Center Camp and at the 9 o'clock and 3 o'clock plazas), where Burning Man volunteers sell bags of ice at $3 a pop for participants to use. (The short lifespan of ice in the desert, even in the best of coolers, makes this nod to commercialism an unfortunate necessity.) RV service trucks can be flagged down, as well, to pump greywater and sewage tanks. This costs $50 (cash), or more, depending on RV size.\n\nOutside of these select situations, vending of any kind, including barter exchange for goods and services (including illegal substances) is, by general communal consent, frowned upon. This can range from \"trade you some of my poetry for some of your food, man\" to \"yo, I gots lots of goodies for sale, come back to my camp\". Most individuals will automatically assume that anyone requesting to purchase anything, from food to water to ice cream to illegal substances, is either a new participant who didn't bother to read the Burning Man website, or (in the case of requests for purchase\/sale of illegal substances) law enforcement officers. In either case, while vending does and continues to occur at the event, it's generally considered classless on par with selling life insurance at a funeral home.\n\nTo avoid this, most participants purchase all of their items prior to entering the event, and\/or make do throughout the week without the things they didn't bring.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nIn keeping with the non-commercial, self-sufficient nature of Burning Man, there are (with one exception) no food stores or restaurants within the borders of Black Rock City. Participants are expected to bring in all the food they need for the week, as well as any cooking equipment needed to prepare it.\n\nThat said, many theme camps give away food on a daily basis or have special events with free food.
