The railway ceased operation after some 110 years of operation due to the run down of the slate industry, road competition, and the Second World War. It was fully reopened to Blaenau Ffestiniog in 1982 and is one of the town's main tourist attractions.\n\nFurther information on the town can be found at ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.walesdirectory.co.uk\/Towns_in_Wales\/Blaenau_Ffestiniog_Town.htm"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Car"]},"\nThe best option to get to the town is by car - mostly because there aren't that many buses or trains to get around.

On some summer days it has more frequent departures than the \"real\" railway.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nAs the town itself is quite small you can easily get around on foot and the town has recently undergone a face lift to help attract visitors to what was the 'Slate Capital of the World' in its hay day. The Llechwedd Slate Caverns, which celebrate the town's famous history, are a mile's walk from the station on the road to Dolwyddelan over the Crimea Pass - or go by car. As all the main roads in and out of town are very narrow main roads with quite fast traffic, so the bicycle isn't a good idea - and for mountain biking other towns in the area are better bases. Blaenau Ffestiniog is celebrated as the only town in North Wales where all roads lead into the Snowdonia National Park. At 850 ft above sea level, it makes the town an ideal base for exploring the park.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Ffestiniog Railway"],["url=http:\/\/www.festrail.co.uk\/"],["email=enquiries@festrail.co.uk"],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Ffestiniog Railway station is adjacent to the mainline station in the town centre"],["phone = +44 1766 516000"],["tollfree="],["fax=+44 1766 516005"],["hours=April - Oct with reduced timetable the rest of the year"],["price=Costs £16.50 round trip, 2.5 hours round trip, £6 more for first class observation car"],["content=Narrow-gauge railway built in the 1800s to convey slate to Porthmadog, opening in 1836.
