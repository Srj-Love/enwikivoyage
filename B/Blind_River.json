Upon discovering Lake Huron and the North Channel of the Mississaugi River which later became part of the Voyageur Route, a fur trading post was established by the Northwest Company in 1789 and later taken over by the Hudson Bay Company in 1820 when trappers settled along the banks of the river leading into Lake Huron. Along this route, one of the rivers was named by the Natives as 'Penewobecong', which was translated as \"Smooth Rock\" or \"Sloping\" but the mouth of this river was not visible to the Voyageurs as they followed the canoe route, so they called it the \"Blind River\", which then became the name of the settlement along the mouth of this river.\n\nSpurred by the growth of the copper mining industry in the 1800s in nearby Bruce Mines, the first sawmill was built beside the mouth of the Blind River at the current site of the Old Mill Motel as it provided timber and planks for the mine. In 1906, Blind River was incorporated as a town and a second sawmill was built at the site of the current Blind River Marine Park. The Carpenter Hixon Company built a state-of-the-art pine sawmill in 1929 that produced over 89 million board feet in its first year and survived as the McFadden Lumber Company, which was the largest white pine sawmill east of the Rocky Mountains, until the 1948 Great Mississauga Fire led to a depletion of timber resources resulting in its eventual closing in 1969 due to difficult economic conditions.\n\nUranium was discovered in the area in 1955 which led to the opening of the short-lived Pronto Mines operation in nearby Algoma Mills whose significance led to the discovery and establishment of the Blind River-Elliot Lake Uranium mining camp. A uranium refinery was built just west of Blind River in 1983 and is now owned by Cameco Corporation, which processes uranium concentrates from all over the world into uranium trioxide.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nHighway 17, about 150 km east of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sault Ste Marie (Ontario)"],["Sault Ste.
