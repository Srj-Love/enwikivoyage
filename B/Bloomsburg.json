A small town of residence with a large population of college students. Bloomsburg is a very small town filled with culture and personality. Bloomsburg is quiet during the week but can get very active on the weekend when the college students fill the streets. It is a very safe place to visit with small town attractions and large event like the Bloomsburg Fair, which last year alone served 432,860 in a one week span.  \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nRoute 11 will get you sraight into the town of Bloomsburg and Interstate 80 (exits 232 or 236) will take you two or three miles north of it. State Routes 487 and 42 provide north-south access. There is a small airport, the Bloomsburg Municipal Airport, in the southeastern part of the town.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThere is no public transportation, but because the town is so small you will almost certainly not need it to get around. However, there is an Enterprise rent-a-car two miles east of Bloomsburg along Route 11. You might want to wear sneakers for the steep hills on the northern side of the town.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Bloomsburg Fair"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.bloomsburgfair.com\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Held in September."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Bloomsburg University"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.bloomu.edu"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Children's Museum"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.the-childrens-museum.org\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Where many college students volunteer and gain working experience."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Bloomsburg Theater"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.bte.org\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Columbia County Historical and Genealogical Society"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.colcohist-gensoc.org\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bloomsburg Community Gardens"]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bloomsburg  Town Park"]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["David Stroup Fountain"]}," at Market Square"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bloomsburg Public Library"]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Visit the Haas Center on Bloomsburg University’s campus"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Visit the Bloomsburg YMCA"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Visit Renaissance Jamboree, which occurs annually in April"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["style"],["Stores not selling anything of special interest to visitors should be deleted, and the remaining ones should be ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikivoyage:Listings"],["wiki-listified"]]},".
