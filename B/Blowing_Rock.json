To assimilate yourself, be approachable and friendly – sit down next to the man at the bar with calloused hands.  He probably knows the best place to go and walk your dog.  Speak to the woman in line in front of you at the grocery store; she might know the best place in town to get a chocolate-infused filet mignon. \n\nWith a population that jumps from 1,500 year-round to 8,000 in the summertime, people are used to making new friends.  The beauty of Blowing Rock is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["dichotomy between the elegant and the down-home"]},".  The affluent traveler may find pleasure in the abundance of fine dining and shopping the area has to offer, but walk just fifteen steps and they’ll find the opposite end of the spectrum – quintessential, good, honest, down home, small town charm.  They can find it everywhere - from the wait staff and diners at the fifteen table “everything” restaurant on Main Street, to the hikers en route the trail to Little Lost Cove.\n\nIf you’re looking for a seedy underbelly, you’re going to have to look pretty hard.\nDowntown Blowing Rock is about as ",{"type":"'''","value":["“Norman Rockwell quaint”"]}," as it gets.  Children are free to roam in a safe and clean park, while their mothers can shop for antiques and designer clothes, and their fathers can sneak off to Kilwin’s Ice Cream Parlor for a free sample of fudge. A military band plays after the downtown Fourth of July parade every year.  Winterfest in January brings ice-carvers and dog-sledders.  Mitford Days in September celebrates Blowing Rock’s inspiration for Jan Karon’s book series.  Year-round, a bubble machine from the Martin House pours soapy goodness into the air, surrounding you as you stroll.  Knight’s on Main has fried oysters every Friday (just try and fight the locals for a table).  Canyons Restaurant even heats their building with recycled fryer oil, for crying out loud!  This is clean livin’.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nHope you like driving!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nWhile there are many opportunities for hiking in the surrounding mountains, one of the best is local: the Glen Burney Trail.  This trail is about .1 mile off of Main Street, and is easily accessible.  Drivers should turn on to Laurel Lane, and then left after .1 mile into a parking lot on the left, labeled the Annie L. Cannon Memorial Gardens.  The trail begins at the end of the parking lot.  \n\nThe trail goes about 1 1\/2 miles down into a gorge, complete with views of several waterfalls.  \n\nIt's common to assume that this is an easy trail because it's so accessible.  ",{"type":"'''","value":["This is a moderately strenuous trail, and hikers should be wary of dangers."]},"  Hikers should stay on the trail.  Even on the trail, large sections are often slippery from wet leaves (especially during the fall of the year, if there's been plenty of rain) or dry leaves, which can be tricky, especially because hikers don't expect it.  Attempting to cross waterfalls is potentially life-threatening, and should never be attempted.  Hikers should also realize that cell phone service (in event of emergency) is spotty in the gorge.  \n\nBut despite these warnings, this is a good trail, enjoyable, and do-able for most healthy adults.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nNatural beauty and tireless planning for small town elegance.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"  \n",{"type":"{{","value":[["style"]]},"\nNature abounds in Blowing Rock and the surrounding area.
