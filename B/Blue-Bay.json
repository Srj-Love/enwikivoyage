While the area around Blue Bay has been a long-established favourite with tourists for its great beaches and crystal-clear waters, the majority of the south coast has no beach, thankfully limiting hotel construction for the most part. One big recent development was the building of three huge luxury hotels on the former sugar estate of Bel Ombre. This was followed in 2006 by the opening of another big luxury hotel in the nearby hamlet of St Felix, all of which will of course contribute to the area’s economy, but, many fear, will also mean Mauritius’ most unspoiled corner will gradually become more and more like the rest of the island. For now though, the area is the most ‘Mauritian’ in the country and the drive along the coastal road from Souillac to Le Morne really shouldn’t be missed. Other highlights include the typically sleepy town of Mahébourg, the wonderful nature reserve Île aux Aigrettes and imposing Lion Mountain, which dominates the region\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nFound South East of Mauritius, the Blue Bay marine park is framed on one side by Le Shandrani Hotel, Blue Lagoon Hotel and the runway of our international airport Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam Airport.\n\nAnd sitting comfortably on top of the marine park is 'Ile des Deux Cocos', an islet within the lagoon, of 4.22 hectares.\n\nAn important and very unique network of coral reefs protect this part of the island from the oceanic waves\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nOnce you are in Blue Bay residential area, you can easily walk from your hotels or villas to the beach since the area is small and with little development.  This makes Blue Bay unique and serene for ultimate relaxation.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThe Blue Bay Marine Park is a must see! There you will find rare corals and fish species in a depth of 5.5 metres. There is more than 50 different species of corals that have been identified, and more than 80% are alive.\n\nThe Blue Bay Marine Park is now protected by the government, due to constant degradation of the marine environment left by urbanisation and the tourism industry.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nFor those who want to be involved in recreational activities there is a large range of land and water sports available  including, tennis, table tennis, volleyball, windsurfing, kayaking, pedaloes, snorkelling and mini sailboats. Deep sea fishing and diving can also be organised.\n\nIn addition,there exist a wide spectrum of sailing activities and you can organize trips to the outlying islets by catamarans and speedboats cruise.  For example, visit to Ile Aigrettes, a 5 hectare islet which consists of an old calcareous coral reef partially overlain by sand and soil deposits. It is an internationally important site as it was declared a nature reserve in 1965. Many of the plants found there grow nowhere else in the world.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nShopping in Mauritius is more than just an interesting experience. It is a journey in time and space of the civilisation and cultures that have come across its history. The sculptures and drums of Africans origin, colourful sarees or tailor-made suit, is a proof of this diversity. Traditional Mauritian Arts and Crafts products and the best-branded luxury goods can be found in a number of shopping centres\/arcades in all the towns and beach resorts.

Gastronomes will find a variety of flavours and aromas inherited from the different migrations through its history in Blue Bay. Culinary traditions from France, India, China and Africa, the best-known and appreciated cuisines in the world, have been passed on through generations. The story of a Mauritian starting the day with a continental breakfast, followed by an Indian Lunch and finishing off with a Chinese dinner is a common cliché.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Mauritius"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["no Wikipedia link"]]}]
