Attempts to cross the mountains began in the very early 1800s and it was not until 1813 when Blaxland, Wentworth and Lawson found a way across the mountains by following the ridges rather than the watercourses.\n\nOnce the route was found, roads, railway and development followed rapidly.  The roads and railways today follow almost exactly the route taken by the original explorers.  A visit to many of the scenic vistas, cliffs and waterfalls in the mountains will give you some appreciation of the challenges anyone would face trying to follow the rivers and creeks across the mountains.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["People"]},"\nThe mountains are a major weekend destination for Sydneysiders, but also have a passionate local community.  Making your way up involves passing through many villages.  Each with its own centre, and residential area around it.\n\nThe lower villages are almost an extension of the Sydney urban area, but the higher you go the more a mountain way of life becomes evident.\n\nLocals of the Blue Mountains tend to be:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Retirees"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Commuters"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Folks looking for an alternative lifestyle, including a large and active gay and lesbian community"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Artists (including, in the past, the infamous Norman Lindsay)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" People who want to get back to nature"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Hospitality and tourism workers"]},"\nThere are also the Gundungurra Aboriginal people, who are now represented by the Gundungurra Tribal Council Aboriginal Corporation, based in Katoomba. It is a not for profit organisation representing the Gundungurra traditional owners, promoting heritage and culture and providing a support for Gundungurra people connecting back to Country.\n\nThe Blue Mountains locals have resisted much development - you'll only find two fast food restaurants (McDonalds\/Burger King) between Glenbrook and Lithgow.\n\nIf you stay long enough to get to know the place, you'll find an interesting mix of 1860, 1960 and last year.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nThe temperature can be up to 10Â°C colder than on the coast during the day, and drop even further overnight.  There is probably only one or two days of snow every one or two years, but there are many more winters days where it ",{"type":"''","value":["feels like it might snow!"]},".   An open fire can be nice on a winters evening.\n\nIf you're in Sydney for a week or so, and planning a day trip to the mountains, it pays to check the weather forecast for each region before deciding which day to travel.  A hot day in Sydney can make the mountains a pleasant escape, and coastal showers in Sydney can also see the mountains still dry and sunny.  However, cold winter rainy days can see mountain views completely obscured by fog for the entire day.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Orientation "]},"\nThe main visitor district of the mountains centres around Katoomba, with Echo Point (Three Sisters), Scenic World, Wentworth Falls and Leura all within a few kilometres each direction.  The towns of Blackheath and Mount Victoria are smaller tourist centres in their own right, only around 15 minutes drive from Katoomba.   Jenolan Caves are a significant distance further, over an hour to drive from Katoomba.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nTravellers visiting Sydney are often faced with the dilemma of how to best get to the mountains to spend a day or a couple of days.  It is quite possible to visit for a day, and to see many of the main sights.\n\nThere are no scheduled commercial flights to the mountains.  The closest airport is Sydney.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nTake the M4 out of Sydney, then continue as the M4 becomes the Great Western Highway (A32) on Lapstone hill.

The traffic is ",{"type":"''","value":["much"]}," worse leaving Sydney on a Friday night, or returning to Sydney on a Sunday afternoon.  Your travel time can double.  After a long weekend, traffic can come to a standstill coming down the mountains into Sydney.\n\nHiring a car from Sydney to spend a day or two in the mountains is a popular option for visitors to Sydney, however an issue often encountered by people staying in the city centre is that car rental companies along the city strip generally close before 6PM, and can have queues when they open at 9AM.  This can make for a very short day in the mountains.  The alternative is paying for an extra days car hire, and for overnight parking in the city for two nights, which can add considerably to the cost.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cityrail.info\/ CityRail"]}," trains run every hour or two to the Blue Mountains from Sydney Central, and can also connect at major stations along the way, like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Parramatta"]]},".

Popular car parks like Wentworth Falls can fill on summer weekends, but travel on the street until you find an available spot. The Great Western Highway (A32) crosses the Mountains east to west, and most places aren't far from it. Expect to pay for parking at Echo Point (The Three Sisters) at $4 per hour, but everywhere else is free of charge.

Their routes are extensive, but can be infrequent - especially on weekends.  Check their timetables before deciding to get around the mountains by bus.\n\nAll their buses use the Sydney ticketing structure, and accept the MyMulti tickets.  Every Blue Mountains Bus Company public bus can be used with any MyMulti ticket (1,2 or 3, or DayPass).  To use a MyMulti on the train from Sydney requires a MyMulti3, MyMulti DayPass, or a return train ticket.  So, if you are visiting Sydney and spending a day or two in the mountains you should consider what ticket you need carefully.  For a single day, the difference in price between a MyMulti1 and a MyMulti3 is greater than a return train trip.  If you were planning to get a MyMulti-1 for use in Sydney, then just buy a return train ticket and use the MyMulti1 for the Blue Mountains Buses.\n\nThe Blue Mountains Bus Company route 686 runs between Katoomba station and Echo Point, and meets each train.  This is perhaps the most useful of the buses.  This bus route runs as a \"trolley\", but MyMulti tickets are valid on it as they are on any other route service.\n\nCash single tickets are also sold on the bus.\n\nThe trolleys also operate a hop-on hop-off service on a longer route, which isn't a public route service ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.trolleytours.com.au\/"]},".
