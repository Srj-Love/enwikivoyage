Lyre birds can be found in the undergrowth in the valley. They imitate the sounds of other birds, so you will probably need to keep your eyes open for them but they are quite a find for any bushwalker to come across. With many things to do, and many places to explore, why wouldn't you try it some time.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Sightseeing "]},"\n\nThere are a number of amazing sites to see just from the main highway and major roads.  The Three Sisters is one famous site that every visitor to the Blue Mountains must stop and see.
