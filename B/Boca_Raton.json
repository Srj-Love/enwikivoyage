The name is Spanish for \"Mouse Mouth\" (although the Chamber of Commerce ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.bocaratonchamber.com"]}," tries to give less plausible alternative explanations of the meaning), which presumably comes from the shape of an inlet when the town was founded.\n\nBoca, as it's known by locals, started growing in earnest in the 1920s, with the help of fanciful nouveau-riche architect Addison Mizner, who also helped design Palm Beach, 30 some miles north. Much of downtown was (and is being) built in \"Addison Mizner-style\" architecture, using distinctive bright orange and more subdued pinks in its Old Spanish theme with a touch of Venice.\n\nBoca's long history of catering to the well-to-do has given it a snobbish reputation, but looking deeper one can find many terrific features that can be enjoyed on any budget. The city is very safe and enjoys a much higher standard of living than many of its neighbors, giving it a well manicured appearance with many amenities. Moreover, visitors can appreciate the limited nightlife and great beaches any time of year as the city consistently enjoys comfortable weather.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Fort Lauderdale International Airport ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.broward.org\/airport "]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["FLL"]},", large airport 20 miles south of Boca in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fort Lauderdale"]]},".
