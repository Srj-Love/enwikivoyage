It popularizes geology and propagates the historical, cultural and environmental qualities of nature and landscape to public. Geoparks promote all resources of the region, including the genius loci of many picturesque sceneries, the beauty of unique locations, the wealth of cultural heritage, traditional crafts, regional agricultural products and interesting local cuisine.

All places are suitable for excursions  for all who wish to enjoy the pleasures and excitements of geotourism and they are interesting and accessible even for people with minimal geological knowledge.\n\nThe distinctive sandstone formations of Bohemian Paradise were created as sea sediments of the Cretaceous Period. The landscape was later formed by volcanic activity,  which also produced many of the precious stones for which the region is also famous.
