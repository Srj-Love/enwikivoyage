In Bohol, the Philippine Tarsier was a common sight in the southern part of the island until the 1960s. Once protected by the humid rainforests and mist-shrouded hills, these mysterious primates struggle to survive as their home is cleared for crop growing and poaching.\n\nTo date, the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.tarsierfoundation.org Philippine Tarsier Foundation"]}," has acquired 7.4 hectares of land in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Corella"]]}," for a tarsier sanctuary. With the Department of Environment and Natural Resources playing an oversight role, the foundation has asked other Bohol towns with tarsier populations to donate 20 hectares (49.4 acres) of forestland for conservation.\n\nIt also runs a Tarsier Research and Development Center, which serves as a visitor center and venue for research, as well as a habitat preserve. At the sanctuary, a spacious net enclosure keeps a number of Philippine Tarsiers for feeding, captive breeding and display. Here, visitors can observe the Philippine Tarsier in their natural habitat. Within the sanctuary, the Philippine Tarsiers roam freely and all of them have got used to a seven-foot high fence that circumscribes the territory and which serves mainly to protect them from predators like feral cats while maintaining a theoretical chance for tarsiers to leave the enclosure and return as their wish.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["The Chocolate Hills"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Bohol-Chocolate Hills.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["The Chocolate Hills of Bohol"]]},"\nThe Chocolate Hills are probably Bohol's most famous tourist attraction.

The hills range from 30 to 50m high and are covered in green grass, which turns to brown during the dry season, making them look like chocolate mounds.\n\nLegend has it that the hills came into existence when two giants threw stones and sand at each other in a fight that lasted for days. When they were finally exhausted, they made friends and left the island, but left behind the mess they made. For the more romantically inclined is the tale of Arogo, a young and very strong giant who fell in love with an ordinary mortal girl called Aloya. After she died, the giant Arogo cried bitterly. His tears then turned into hills, as a lasting proof of his grief.\n\nHowever, up to this day, even geologists have not reached consensus on how they where formed. The most commonly accepted theory is that they are the weathered formations of a kind of marine limestone on top of an impermeable layer of clay.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Danao Adventure Park"],["alt=E.A.T.
