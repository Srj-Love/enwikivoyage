Boipeba is home to a dense Atlantic rainforest, and with its salt marshes, sand dunes, extensive mangroves, and paradisiacal coconut-palmed beaches and reefs, it is a world of ecological diversity. The reefs are found up and down the coast, sheltering the beaches from waves and ocean currents. The wide reefs are full of canals and shallow pools. Flora and fauna are rich in varieties of coral, algae, fish, mollusks, sea urchins, starfish, and other sea life. There are sea turtles found in the region, and spawning eggs can be seen on beaches around the island. The forested areas of the island are home to numerous species of birds, armadillos, fox and reptiles, as well as other animal life. Boipeba being a natural wildlife habitat, and given the necessity of protecting the Tinharé and Boipeba ecosystems, the state of Bahia created the Area of Environmental Protection (APA in Portuguese) of the islands of Tinharé and Boipeba, in June 1992. In joining forces together as Amabo, the Association of Residents and Friends of Boipeba, residents of Boipeba put together a proposal of Sustainable Development for the island. With this proposal, Amabo would like to help better the lives of the local population, developing economic activities, especially tourism, without destroying the environment.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nFrom ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Salvador"]]}," take the ferry to Bombdespacho (45 minutes)\nFrom there get the bus ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Valeça (Bahia)"],["Valença"]]}," (2 hours)\nFrom ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Valença (Bahia)"],["Valença"]]}," get the slow boat (4 hours) or the speedboat 1.30 hour ($37)\nYou can also get a boat via ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Morro de São Paulo"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThere are no cars on the island (excepting the ambulance and the police motorbike)\nThere are 3 tractors used to transport people to further reaches of the island\nMany of the interrnal roads to the far side of the island are very sandy and can not be easily cycled\nThe east and south of the island can be easily navigated by walking along the shore and a short jungle path\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nSnorkelling is good\nThere is no scuba diving operating on the island at present.\nEnjoy the beaches - busy by the port and increasingly empty until you reach Miereles.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Suntan lotion before you go"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Cocktails"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nMany of the restaurants serve portions to share (so do not be too alarmed at the prices)\n\nOn the beach from the main port is a good place to get sandwiches if you are not ready for a full on meal.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nThere are a range of options centred by\na) the port\nb) miereles\n\nAbaquar Hostel is a good lively and affordable option 5 minutes from the beach and port (the road to it is opposite the hostel.
