Although its economic growth has its roots in the Simplot potato industry, the city is now home to many high tech industries. Notable companies such as Albertsons and Micron are headquartered here.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Understand "]},"\n\nAlthough the exact origin is disputed, the name \"Boise\" is thought to be derived from the French ",{"type":"''","value":["les bois"]},", or \"the trees.\" The name is a reference to the tree-lined Boise River, which passes through the heart of the city. To this day the city takes its \"City of Trees\" moniker very seriously, although before settlement there were actually very few trees here.\n\nBoise started its life as Fort Boise, a U.S. Army installation located at a strategic junction on the Oregon Trail between what were then the major settlements in southern Idaho Territory, the mining camps of Silver City to the south and Idaho City to the northeast. A city grew quickly around the fort, and by 1865 was the new capital of Idaho Territory (much to the chagrin of northern Idahoans, namely residents of Lewiston). By the dawn of the 20th Century, Boise was far and away the dominant city in the region, having long eclipsed the likes of Silver City and Idaho City.\n\nToday Boise is sometimes seen as the eastern edge of the Pacific Northwest, or the western edge of the Rocky Mountains, or both, depending on who you ask. Downtown Boise and the North End neighborhood offer a PNW feel every bit as strong as anything in Portland or Seattle, while suburbs such as Meridian and Nampa steadfastly cling to the decidedly self-reliant ethos of the Intermountain West.\n\nBoise is a sports town strongly supporting its local teams, including the NBA D-League Idaho Stampede, the ECHL Idaho Steelheads, and of course its emerging college football powerhouse at Boise State University - all with recent league and conference championships. Slowly but surely, Boise is beginning to accept its role as a major metropolitan area in the western United States, while at the same time embracing its small town past.\n\nRegions of the city are best distinguished by the age of the construction (pre 1950's, 1950's-1980's suburbs, and post 1990 suburbs) and the affluence of their inhabitants, with the premier exception being downtown, which is non-residential construction and nightlife. The North End refers to a distinct neighborhood due to the grid style of street construction, smaller pre-1940's suburban houses, relatively dense vegetation, and numerous amenities within walking distance of most residents. Boise has no culturally discernible neighborhoods, although a few ethnic restaurants and food stores exist.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By plane "]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.iflyboise.com Boise Airport"]}]}," (BOI) is located less than 5 miles south of Boise.
