Trekking tours for US $18â€“20 can be booked in town, including lunch. It is not actually a trekking tour but just an hour one-way trek upwards after 30-40 min travelling up from the entrance. Those who can't hike can still go up by the provided transportation, although minor road construction is still taking place, but it is doable. The starting price for the package inclusive of sunset boat ride (which cost about US $5) is US $25, but is negotiable down to around US $20 (or maybe less depending on who you talk to and your negotiation skill) provided you get to the right tour agency\/office.\n\nIt is possible to do the trip on a 125cc scooter but this will be rather back-breaking. Large dirt bikes are also available for rent in Kampot which would be the better option, providing you have experience riding them.\n\nAlternatively rent a car or scooter with a driver. The locals know the road very well and will manage the trip to the top in not more than 1.5 hr.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nRuins of the Black Palace, a church, and Bokor Palace Hotel and Casino.

Beware though that none of the tracks are currently maintained, so it is best to hire a ranger for your own safety.\n\nThere is the visit to the Popokvil Waterfalls.
