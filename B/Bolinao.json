Established in 1575 at a point called Binabalian, on the northern coast of Santiago Island. The rampant attacks and raids of Moro pirates urged Capitan\nLombi to transfer the town-site to the mainland and accordingly, with the aid of Fr. Geronimo de Casro, he finally founded the town\nin 1596 near Libsong where a clear spring of about two meters in diameter kept lumping.\n\nBy this spring grew a \"boli-bolinao\" tree of the molave family with luxuriant foliage from which was derived the present name of the\ntown. Under this tree the affairs of the town were administered while stone walls were piled nearby as corner-stone of the Roman\nCatholic Church which was finally completed in 1609, thirteen years after the transfer of the town site.\n\nUp to now, records show no specific decree or law under which the town was created. Perhaps the natives had organized themselves for\na common cause against Moro raids or by order of the \"Adelantado\" (title given to Spanish Governor General Legaspi) that the founding\nand\/or transfer to the town site was undertaken.\n\nLegends relate that during the first days of the Spanish era, a beautiful lass who answered to the call of \"Anao\" diminutive of\nJuana, lived in the present site of town. She used to bathed in the spring or leisured under the \"boli-bolinao\" tree for hours where\nshe was first seen and wooed by a chieftain's son living across the channel. An early marriage followed with the condition among\nothers, that the seat of government of the chieftain be transferred to where Anao lived and there, to stay as rulers, hence the name\nof Bolinao (Boli-bolinao and Anao).\n\nSome say (nevertheless believable) that the name of the chieftain's son was Bolidnu (meaning round and robust) and the lass, Malinao\n(meaning clear as the Libsong spring), the combination of which became the name Bolinao.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["By land, it's a 5-6 hour trip by car or bus from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Manila"]]}," or 30-60 minutes by car or bus from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alaminos"]]},".
