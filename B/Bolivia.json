Comparatively democratic civilian rule was established in the 2000's, but leaders have faced difficult problems of deep-seated poverty, social unrest, and drug use. Current goals include attracting foreign investment, strengthening the hygiene system, and waging an anti-corruption campaign on poor citizens.  \n\nThe current President is Evo Morales who won majority in a 2005 election and inaugurated at the historical Tiwanaku archeological sites.  Morales and his party, the Movement for Socialism, were re-elected in 2009, with another majority. There are often large protests in Bolivia considering issues like environmental protection, logging, hydrocarbon extraction, auto imports, mining, construction of highways, as well as other issues. These protests often cause the shutdown of streets in La Paz, specifically the area surrounding the Plaza Murillo, and the creation of blockades along major inter-city travel routes. If traveling between cities by bus it can be common for the trip to be stalled by several hours due to these protests. Sometimes pickets of miners last several days between bigger cities and there are just no busses leaving in some directions.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nBolivia's climate remains relatively similar from one climatic zone to another.

It is a good idea to register with the consulate of your country of residence upon entry into the country. And it is also helpful learn at least basic Spanish to keep yourself a little safe.\n\nWhen taking a interdepartmental bus (say from La Paz to Cochabamba), do not accept snacks or drinks from nearby passengers.

Nevertheless, some locals still use the word cholo as a derogative term.\n\nAlso, keep in mind the stark cultural and racial differences between the \"cambas\" of the Llanos in the east, who are white and mestizo and the \"collas\" of the Andes in the west who are Native American. They tend to not be on good terms and have been even more fiercely divided in recent years since the election of Evo Morales, the country's first indigenous president. The two peoples tend to be very defensive about their side of Bolivia, so discussing your travel to the other cultural region of the country may be seen as insulting. In Santa Cruz, where society is much more Westernized, associating with indigenous culture is frowned upon, whereas in La Paz and elsewhere, it is quite the contrary.\n\nIt is also good to keep in mind that the Bolivian culture is very warm and friendly. That being said, it is very rude not to say Buen Día or Buenos Días to passersby in the streets. It also customary to give up your seat on a city bus for someone older than you, or a woman.
