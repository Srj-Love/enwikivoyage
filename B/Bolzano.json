The village founded nearby was called Bauzanum. The region of South Tyrol was historically settled by ethnic Germans and Ladins.\n\nBolzano has been a trading point since its foundation owing to its location between the two major cities of Venice and Augsburg. In 1262 it was elevated to a ",{"type":"''","value":["Stadt"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["city"]},"). In 1363 Bolzano became part of the Habsburg monarchy as part of the county of Tyrol. Four times a year a market was held and traders came from the south and the north. The mercantile magistrate was therefore founded in 1635. Every market season two Italian and two German officers (appointed from the traders who operated there) held this office. The city was a cultural crossroads at that time.\n\nIn 1919, after World War I, Bolzano was annexed by Italy against the will of the native population who had opted to join the new German Republic of Austria.  Starting in 1926, after the rise of fascism, the region's ethnic Germans were subjected to a policy of forced italianization. The fascist dictatorship encouraged the moving of many ethnic Italians to the city from other parts of Italy (primarily from Northern Italy) in an attempt to italianize the whole region. After World War II Bolzano was once again assigned to Italy but this time the German-speaking population demanded self-determination and afterwards accepted the autonomy statute, which is ensured internationally. After decades of tension, particularly in the 1950s and the 1980s, (which included minor terrorist plots), Bolzano is now a multilingual European city open to the future, hosts students from all over the world and therefore hosts a lot of interesting cultural events. For this reason Bolzano is hoping to become European Capital of Culture in 2019.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Culture"]},"\nBolzano is constantly among the top-ranked cities in Italy when it comes to quality of life. It has one of Europe's lowest unemployment rates, excellent services and a wonderful landscape. Many Italians say they would like to live in Bolzano. However it is recognized that the city is a little expensive.\n\nBolzano has many special features:  it's an Italian city with Austrian flair. In the city centre you will mostly hear people speak German or Austro-Bavarian. Nowadays, however, Italian- and German-speaking people are living together in bilingual Bolzano. Generally \"Bozner\" or \"Bolzanini\" are friendly and helpful. Most German-speaking people can speak Italian but Italian-speaking people are unlikely to be able to speak German. Nevertheless many young people can also speak English and a few can speak French too. In South Tyrolean schools the learning of the second language (Italian for German-speakers and vice-versa) and of English is compulsory.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh=6"],["febhigh=9"],["marhigh=14"],["aprhigh=19"],["mayhigh=23"],["junhigh=27"],["julhigh=29"],["aughigh=28"],["sephigh=24"],["octhigh=18"],["novhigh=11"],["dechigh=6"],["janmean=0"],["febmean=3"],["marmean=7"],["aprmean=12"],["maymean=16"],["junmean=20"],["julmean=22"],["augmean=21"],["sepmean=17"],["octmean=12"],["novmean=5"],["decmean=1"],["janlow= -5"],["feblow= -2"],["marlow= 1"],["aprlow= 5"],["maylow= 9"],["junlow= 13"],["jullow= 15"],["auglow= 15"],["seplow= 11"],["octlow= 6"],["novlow= 0"],["declow= -4"],["janprecip=24"],["febprecip=26"],["marprecip=36"],["aprprecip=57"],["mayprecip=73"],["junprecip=80"],["julprecip=89"],["augprecip=86"],["sepprecip=71"],["octprecip=71"],["novprecip=67"],["decprecip=33"]]},"\nLocal tourist guides often say that Bolzano has an incredible Mediterranean climate.
