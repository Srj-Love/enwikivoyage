Bonn has been destroyed and pummeled on so many occasions that it nearly became a pastime.  Norman invaders were the first to burn the town to the ground in 881 and again in 892.  In 1198, King Philip of Swabia and Duke Heinrich von Brabant laid siege to Bonn.  In 1244 Konrad von Hochstaden, archbishop of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cologne"]]}," ordered Bonn to be fortified.  The reasons for fortification may have been for the Archbishop's protection as he had apparently begun fighting with Cologne's leaders and often resided in Bonn after the dispute.  In 1288 under Sigfried II von Westerburg the archbishopric was transferred from Cologne to Bonn, which has since been transferred back to Cologne.\n\nIn 1582 Archbishop Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg converted to Calvinism and refused to give up his position as elector.  In February of 1583 Waldburg married and was in April of the same year excommunicated by Pope Gregory XIII.  After the Truschessian War Gebhard fled to Strasbourg, but not before Bonn felt the rapture of Bavarian troops, who blew up the Godesberg (the archbishop's residence) with 1,500 pounds of gunpowder.  While the town survived the Thirty Years' War Bonn was completely destroyed in 1689 as a result of the War of the Grand Alliance.\n\nIn December 1770 Bonn's most famous son, Ludwig van Beethoven, was born on Bonngasse.  Bonn is probably best known as Beethoven's birthplace and this fact is well advertised by the city despite Beethoven's vehement disgust towards his hometown.  Beethoven spent some time in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vienna"]]}," hoping to study with Mozart, but after his mother's death he was forced to return to Bonn for five years to raise his two younger brothers since his alcoholic father was unable to.
