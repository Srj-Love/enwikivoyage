Boquete shares some of the same mountain ranges with Costa Rica, as well as, some of the incredible wildlife and rain forests. However, because it is not as well known, and a 'road less traveled', prices are lower, and it is not as commercial. You can hike for 1\/2 a day, or all day, and still have a rare chance to see the Resplendent Quetzal, or a Howler Monkey in the wild. The Boquete Valley is rich with agriculture as well; strawberries, oranges, and coffee come from this region. Volcan Baru, Panama's highest point, is literally the easiest place in the world to see both of the worlds great oceans. The famous 'geisha' coffee, that was sold at auction, for $130 a pound, can be found growing on the rich Volcanic slopes. Adventure travel is a key reason that Boquete, a fairly small town, is growing in popularity for European, American, Latino, and Asian travelers.
