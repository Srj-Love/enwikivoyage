Facilities for the usual water sports activities such as sailing, wind surfing, snorkeling, diving and jet skiing are also widely available for those in search of more active pursuits. The fun in Boracay also doesn't end when the sun sets. Boracay nightlife is pulsating with many bars and restaurants serving food, drink and fun until the very late evening.\n\nBoracay is an excellent choice for anyone who wants a full range of facilities in a prime tropical location and can pay for it.

Make sure you leave early so you arrive before 4AM. In the morning, the ship to Caticlan usually leaves at 2AM and 4AM and the next trip won't be until 10AM.

The water tends to be a little rougher on this side of the island but it is much quieter.  Similarly, there are fewer services—there are only a couple of restaurants, but you likely won't have a problem getting a cold drink or an ice cream as there are a few vendors that patrol the beach. The main road in Boracay terminates at Puka Beach therefore you'll be able to hire a tricycle to get there in less than 10–15 minutes from central White Beach.

The cave is on the western-end of the island and down several dirt roads. The guide will then take you on a short hike through the forest to the mouth of a cave, which drops down at a very steep angle.

There is no visible path, no handrail, and the stones are extremely slippery with slime and bat guano, as well as extremely dangerous, since the cave is at such an extreme angle. Also, the air inside the cave is very warm and humid, and in addition to the amount of guano, is very difficult to breathe. Additionally, several snakes live inside the cave.

When you call them to get a room rate or make a reservation, you will be quoted much more than if you called the resort itself.

Meanwhile, the traveler has no idea he wasn't talking to the resort. This can often lead to frustration, as the traveler will show up at his hotel or resort and see he was charged double the rate that the hotel is listing, even though the hotel had nothing to do with it! So the advice is, try your best to ignore the many travel agencies and make your reservation with the resort or hotel directly.\n\nBetter yet, don't make advance reservations in the low season.

Bulabog Beach has the \"old\" Boracay atmosphere, being less developed than the White Beach area, quieter, more laid back, with onshore breezes most of the year, and a number of foreign residents have made it their home. In addition, resorts are starting to appear and the various types of water-sports (para-sailing, banana boats, jetskis, water-skiing, etc.) are using this area during the White Beach off-season (May-Oct, when the Habagat wind blows). Access to the D'Mall Shopping Center is only a 5 minute walk and a couple of minutes later you are on White Beach with all the crowds, restaurants, bars, discos, etc.\n\nWater on Bulabog is much polluted with sewage water of the whole island. You can see few pipes and \"rivers\" are emptying to sea. Since the lagoon is semi-closed and shallow, and water circulation is limited, you can feel smell from water. Color of it will block all your thoughts about swimming there and lot of kiters will simply not allow you to.
