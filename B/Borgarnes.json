In fact Icelanders themselves often don't know much more of the town other than its highway dining options. However, tourism has been growing in recent years with increased interest in the region's history. In fact, Borgarnes is a perfect getaway from Reykjavík: It only takes about an hour to get there, but the setting is completely different, much closer to what some people would term the \"real\" Iceland.\n\nThe name Borgarnes means \"Borg peninsula\" and refers to a farm of that name, Borg. Borg was the home of Egill Skallagrímsson, the titular character of Egil's saga.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nBorgarnes lies on the ring road and is easily accessible by car.

Between Reykjavík and Borgarnes there is a toll road, the tunnel under Hvalfjörður. The toll is 1000kr. each way for a normal car, but it's also possible to drive around the fjord adding just under an hour to your journey.\n\nSeveral busses leave from BSÍ bus terminal in Reykjavík every day heading up to Borgarnes.
