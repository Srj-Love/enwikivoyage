The history goes back to the famous Vikings. Numerous findings at southern Bornholm indicate that Bornholm was a well established trading point. Poland, Sweden and Germany are all in the range of 100 km. That made Bornholm attractive for the Danish king and the archbishop of Lund and the city of Lübeck during medieval times. Catholics who fasted were only allowed to eat fish and other similar things, so that in the 13th century herring was the main income source on Bornholm.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Medieval "]},"\nThe European plague struck Bornholm in the middle of the 14th century and halved the population. It was also during this time that Hammershus was constructed, as well as the famous 'round churches'. From 1525 to 1576 Bornholm was in pawn to Lübeck, because the Danish king Frederik I had been supported it in his rebellion against the Swedish King Christian II. The people of Bornholm were suppressed with high taxes and forced work. The people of Bornholm tried to break free but the revolt was fought down in the battle of Ugleenge.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:BornholmGranitBrud.jpg"],["thumb"],["Granite quarry near Hammershus"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Early Modern"]},"\nA battle between Denmark and Sweden in 1645 led to Swedish control of the island, but it was brief - they left again the same year. In the Roskildepeace of 1658 Bornholm, Skåne, Halland and Blekinge were given to Sweden. Again the people were forced to pay high taxes to the suppressive forces. The Danish king advised the people of Bornholm to fight back. In 1658 the Swedish commander of Bornholm was killed in Rønne, and the people of Bornholm freed themselves from years of foreign command. Bornholm was given to the Danish king as 'his island'. Jens Kofoed, Poul Anker, Peder Olsen and Villum Clausen became champions of liberty. The same four men have, in modern times, given name to the ferries from Bornholmstrafikken.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["World War II 1940-1946"]},"\nBornholm was Danish until World War Two, and then was it taken over by the Germans and later freed by the Russians in 1945; the Russians wouldn't leave Bornholm because of the progressing cold war and only left after being given some special privileges.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["The Cold War 1946-1989"]},"\nBornholm was NATO's Fist towards the east, but a Russian (Soviet) declaration after World War II stated that the placement of \"foreign soldiers\" (NATO) on Bornholm wasn't allowed. So, it was only Danish soldiers who were allowed duty at Bornholm.  Because they were able to listen to Soviet, Polish and East German military radio transmissions from a location much further to the east of any other NATO members, enabling military movements and reinforcements deep within the Soviet Union to be monitored, Denmark's contribution to shared NATO intelligence was very highly valued, particularly at times of international tension. More recently NATO radar installations have been placed on the island.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Industry"]},"\nAs in other places in the world, Bornholm felt the industrial revolution during the 19th century, and in 1843 its Hasle klinker (clinker)was established, it was one of Bornhom's biggest export ventures since the herring in the Middle Ages. Also, the underground of Bornholm was and still is today a major part of the Bornholm industry. Bornholm is an island of Granite.\nBornholmstrafikken (formerly known as ‘Dampskibsselskabet af 1866’or The Steamship Company of 1866) was founded in 1866 and is still the regular route to and from Bornholm.\n\nBornholm's main income source has, as an island, always been the sea which surrounds it, and in the 1970s through the 1980s the fishermen of the island were so successful that many of them became really wealthy. No one ever wondered about the quantity of fish they pulled up in their boats until the beginning of the 1990s. The harbours and processing facilities were all rebuilt to be prepared for a new season of fishing, but the season was called off by marine biologists.  Because of overfishing, the sea was empty, there were no fish in it. That led to a crash in the industry because one man at sea could keep six on shore at work – in processing facilities, shopping, service and maintenance. \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:BornholmGranit.jpg"],["thumb"],["five kinds of granite on Bornholm (from Aakirkeby square)"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Tourism"]},"\nToday Bornholm is a popular travel destination for many people in the Baltic region as well as tourists from Sweden, Norway, Germany, Poland and the rest of Denmark who are a common sight in the summertime.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nAs Bornholm has many tourists each year most people speak either English, German or Swedish, the exception being most of the older population.\nAlmost all tourist folders are to be found in English, German, Polish and a Scandinavian language.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By plane "]},"\n\nBornholm airport ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.bornholmairport.dk\/"]}," near Rønne.

Wednesday and Saturday from 9AM-2PM throughout the summer season and only on Saturdays until noon the rest of the year. The market is crowded with people, buying and talking, watching and contemplating... listening to the live music and drinking beer.The requirement for being a vendor here is, you have to have made the wares yourself. There are fresh organic vegetables, battered fried fish, sausages and bitters, photo-cards, jewellery, artworks and crafts, hats sweaters and socks, even leather shoes; there is something for everyone here.  A big hit with the kids is the horse and buggy ride around the town, picking up and dropping people off on the market. The colourful life of the market on its own is worth the visit. The unique red church from the 1300s is also worth seeing, it is one of the oldest on the island and one of the prettiest too, as it watches over Baltic. Svaneke has two harbours, a larger one and a smaller one for the locals, filled with colourful boats and a nearby seafood smokehouse (with indoor and outdoor dining).
