It was likely founded as a religious site in the 8th century at the peak of the Sailendra dynasty in central Java. The construction is thought to have taken a period of 75 years, and completed in about 825 A.D.\n\nThe haphazard jumble of Hinduism and Buddhism from this period in Java's history can be baffling for visitors. Together with the records of many royal marriages between Hindu and Buddhist nobles, many Hindu and Buddhist monuments were constructed in the region at this time. For example, Borobudur and the nearby Hindu ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Prambanan"]]}," temple complex were more or less contemporaneous. This, together with many records of royal marriages between Hindu and Buddhist nobles, has led academics to believe that there was little serious conflict concerning religion in central Java at this time.\n\nBorobudur lay abandoned and hidden for centuries under layers of volcanic ash and thick jungle growth. Nobody knows for sure why it was abandoned, although the popular theories are that the local population just became disinterested when there were mass conversions to Islam in the 15th century, or they were simply driven away by a large volcanic eruption. It was never forgotten entirely though, with local folklore ensuring that stories of the great monument lived on.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Borobudur EastGate.JPG"],["thumb"],["350px"],["Borobudur as seen from the east"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Rediscovery"]},"\n\nFollowing the Anglo-Dutch Java War, Java was briefly under British administration from 1811 to 1816. The British governor was Thomas Stamford Raffles (the founder of Singapore), and he took a great practical and academic interest in the history of the mystical island of Java. On a tour to Semarang in 1814, he was informed about a huge ‘lost’ monument deep in the jungles near Yogyakarta, and he sent a Dutch engineer to investigate. It took two months to clear the jungle and partially reveal the amazing monument, but it was not until 1885 that the complex was unearthed in its magnificent entirety.  Raffles also presided over the re-discovery of nearby ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Prambanan"]]},", and it is somewhat ironic that the very brief British rule of Java led to the uncovering of ",{"type":"''","value":["both"]}," these ancient monuments.\n\nAppreciation and protection was surprisingly slow to develop, and Borobudur became the domain of unscrupulous souvenir hunters. Modern-day archaeologists speculate that this was due to the European obsession with Ancient Egypt at the time — Borobudur was just too remote and too far away to get the attention it undoubtedly deserved. There was even a Dutch proposal to dismantle the monument and scatter it piece-by-piece to museums around the world.  Thankfully, good sense prevailed and by the end of the 19th century the site was left largely intact, and a five year restoration programme was undertaken in 1907.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Borodubur Relief.JPG"],["thumb"],["350px"],["Carved reliefs in Borobudur's lower terraces"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Modern day Borobudur"]},"\nIn 1956 UNESCO began an assessment process for the full scale restoration of the monument. Finally in 1968, a major plan to restore Borobudur was created, and this huge project involved a complete overhaul of the monument up until 1983. The unsteady foundations were stabilized, everything was meticulously cleaned and a major drainage system installed. After the works were finished, UNESCO formally listed Borobudur as a World Heritage Site in 1991. Since then, the profile of Borobudur has increased enormously, and it is now a major international tourist attraction. Its statues, reliefs and stupas have spawned millions of replicas which adorn properties worldwide.\n\nThis huge popularity has its downsides. Both deliberate vandalism and general wear and tear are of great concern for the future integrity of the monument. Pleas for visitors not to touch anything are made in the form of signs, by broadcast warnings, and by the presence of guards, but this does not stop the problem. Many have called for the monument to be closed to casual visitors, and for access to be only via timed guided tours.\n\nAs well as being the single most popular tourist attraction in modern day Indonesia, Borobudur has resumed its role as an important place of worship and pilgrimage for Indonesian Buddhists. Visitors should be understanding and respectful of this, especially during major Buddhist holiday periods.\n\nThe 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake which badly damaged nearby ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Prambanan"]]},", left Borobudur unscathed.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["The 2010 eruption of Mount Merapi"]},"\n\nBorobudur was heavily affected by the eruption of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mount Merapi"]]}," in October and November 2010. Volcanic ash from Merapi fell on the temple complex, which is approximately 28 km (17.5 mi) west-southwest of the crater. During the strong eruption of 3–5 November for example, a layer of ash up to 2.5 cm (1 in) thick fell onto the temple. This also killed nearby vegetation. Experts feared that the acidic ash might severely damage the historic site. The temple complex was closed from 5–9 November 2010 to clean up that ash-fall, and the upper levels remained closed to the public until late September 2011. Upon reopening the upper levels, the Borobudur Conservation Agency announced that visitor numbers to those levels were restricted to under 82 people.\n\nUNESCO donated US $3 million as a part of rehabilitation costs to rid the temple's stones of volcanic sediment, then to plant trees to stabilise temperatures, and finally to support the living conditions of local residents. More than 55,000 stone blocks from the temple structure had to be dismantled to enable restoration of the drainage system, which had been clogged by slurry after rains. This restoration programme is predicted to be finished in November 2011.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Orientation"]},"\n\nBorobudur lies in the Kedu Plain - a very fertile volcanic plain between the twin volcanoes of Mount Sumbing and Mount Sundoro to the west, and Mount Merbabu and Mount Merapi to the east.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Information office"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=PT Taman Wisata Candi Borobudur Prambanan Ratu Boko"],["url=http:\/\/www.borobudurpark.co.id\/en.html"],["email=borobudur@borobudurpark.co.id"],["address=Borobudur Temple Unit Office, Jl Badrawati, Borobudur"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+62 293 788266"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=6AM-6PM daily"],["price="],["content=The official government park authority for Borobudur."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Borobudur route map.png"],["thumb"],["right"],["355px"],["Borobudur route map"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nThe nearest larger airports are ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yogyakarta"]]},"'s ",{"type":"'''","value":["Adisucipto International Airport (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["JOG"]]},")"]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Solo"]]},"'s ",{"type":"'''","value":["Adisumarmo International Airport (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["SOC"]]},")"]},".

Seriously. There is a lot written in travel guides about the pushy nature of the vendors at Borobudur. And they can be a little annoying it must be said. But a few friendly no's and keeping on walking usually does the job.\n\nYogyakarta is a great seat of learning in Indonesia, and you will often find many students at Borobudur who are keen to be friendly with you. Take this how it is meant; they are genuinely friendly, and rightly very proud of their heritage and keen to talk to you about it. To avoid the largest crowds, skip weekends when large numbers of domestic tourists visit, along with the occasional school trip of students, sent by their teachers to practice their English on overseas visitors. Alternatively, visit as early as you can in the morning.\n\nIf you look vaguely Western, you'll be a bigger tourist attraction to school students than the monument itself. Expect to be filmed or audio recorded as students ask you all sorts of harmless questions - David Frost they are not - then ask for a photo with you.
