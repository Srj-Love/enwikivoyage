[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Bosa banner 01.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Bosa Sardaigne.jpg"],["550px"],["thumbnail"],["View of Bosa"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Bosa"]}," is a city in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sardinia"]]},". A mix of traditional and modern, it has a unique and compelling historic centre. There is a warren of cobbled streets with pastel coloured medieval tower houses called Sa Costa. The main street in the old town, Corso Vittorio Emmanuele, is lined by 19th century palazzos with wrought iron balconies, and interesting shops, caffes and bars. Castello Malaspina, dating from 1112, guards Bosa at the top of the hill. The river Temo runs through Bosa and is lined with palm trees on one bank and derelict tanneries on the other, which are of historic and national significance. Bosa has an illustrious and wealthy past, based on its position in a well-defended valley, along the only navigable river in Sardinia, and its (now defunct)leather tanning industry. There is a large cathedral and many smaller churches in the town and surrounding countryside.\n\nThe feeling is relaxed and the local people are friendly and welcoming. As it is a real working city, albeit small (8,000 inhabitants) it has an authentic, original character rather than just being an ersatz tourist village. Tourists do come to Bosa, but they tend to be people looking for culture, history, natural and architectural beauty as well as a sun and sand holiday. \n\nThere are numerous beaches nearby.  The largest one is Bosa Marina, which is regularly voted cleanest beach in Italy. It is a sandy strand, fringed with bars and caffes run by locals, protected by a rocky arm with a Catalan tower at the end.  There are also smaller cove beaches accessible by footpath or boat, and stunning and unusual rock formations and natural swimming pools. The sea is clear and amazing shades of blue. The prevailing northwest wind, La Mistrale, cools the air during the hottest summer months. \n\nJust south of Bosa is a fertile valley, where Malvasia di Bosa, a sherry like wine, is produced in tiny artisan vineyards. There is a wine trail and it is possible to go on tasting tours.\n\nThe sun is strong and the colours are bright -- if you are visually orientated the place will amaze you. If you like music and dance, there are frequent public festivals and open air concerts. If you have a sense of adventure, with every day bringing a new discovery, Bosa will not disappoint.  It is a great place to go for a family holiday, or to relax and unwind, and get in touch with yourself.  If you are looking for a place with lots of clubs and pubs full of drunken young people, this is not the place to come. There is lots to do and see in the area, but it is more chilled than frantic.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nBosa is on the northwestern coast of Sardinia, 45 km south of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alghero"]]},", down a spectacular coastal road.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Sardinia"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["40.3"],["8.5"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Europe\/Italy\/Sardinia\/Localities\/Bosa\/"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Bosa"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Bosa"]]}]
