From founding the first public school in 1635, to the Red Sox winning the world series in 2013, Boston has always looked to its future while keeping a foot in its past. Visiting will reveal a distinct mix of puritanical ideals and liberal politics -- medical marijuana may now be legal, but buying beer before noon on Sunday certainly isn't!\n\nBoston is one of the few old American cities that has managed to preserve a respectable chunk of its history. You will find buildings dotted across the city dating from before America existed. Walking around some areas like the North End, you might be forgiven for forgetting you were even in the States at all! \n\nOr perhaps you're familiar with a few of our sports teams? Boston's four major teams have cumulatively brought home 8 championship titles over the last decade or so. The Patriots in 2001, 2003, 2004; the Red Sox in 2004, 2007, 2013; the Celtics in 2008; and the Bruins in 2011. And that's just the games they won. Grab a ticket and enjoy a game and the atmosphere at \"the shrine\" of baseball, Fenway Park.\n\nAnd of course scholarly pursuits in Boston are second to none. Anchored by world the renowned Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology across the river, Boston itself is home to over 30 colleges with a student population of over 130,000. The seasonal ebb and flow of fresh students and the new ideas they bring, are a key aspect to understanding life in the city.\n\nAs you're exploring the city, feel free to stop someone on the street and ask them a question. Whether you're turned around, or if you just want a second opinion about a certain bar or restaurant. Don't believe everything you've heard, the people of Boston are actually a lot friendlier than you might expect. Welcome to Boston!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Districts"]},"\nNew England's love of towns (Massachusetts alone has 351) and town governance, has created hundreds of smaller, closer knit communities than is common elsewhere in the United States. Because of this fact even a large city like Boston has found it difficult to annex surrounding areas over time as it grew. When a town was annexed it retained its unique culture and vibrant neighborhoods. \n\nWhat this means for the traveller: you'll find most every district goes by more than one name, and some of the bigger districts can be sub-divided into a maddeningly long list of places! The full count is north of 110 sub-districts, squares, and neighborhoods. Don't worry about remembering all those names, just remember that Boston is a very compact walkable city.

It's prone to bouts of humidity and some surprisingly high temperatures considering the region, often topping out in the 90s, in the summer. Boston summers are warm and humid, with sunshine 60-65% of the time and typical highs in the mid 70s to high 80s Â°F (mid to upper 20s Â°C). Winters tend to be cold and bitter, with several days of heavy snowfall expected every winter, and temperatures sometimes known to fall below 0Â°F (-18Â°C).\n\nWhen the heat does start, there are some beaches within the city, and many beaches outside of it, for swimming. Beware that no matter how hot it is outside, the ocean water will not be warm, with the exception of some beaches on nearby ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cape Cod"]]},".\n\nEarly and late summer tends to be nice, but this varies by year. In that time, the temperature will be perfect, and there will be no humidity. The city does have unpredictable stretches of heat between late June and early August when low 90s and high humidity are expected.  All public transit options, including cabs, buses, and the public transit system (both formally and informally called the T) are air-conditioned, with the exception of some older cars on the heavy rail T lines such as the Orange Line, Blue Line, and Red Line.\n\nBoston's fall foliage is at or near its peak beauty in mid-October, which also normally offers the advantage of many crisp sunny days (outside the city itself, peak foliage timing depends on how far north or south you venture from Boston.)\n\nIf you visit during the wintertime, the Atlantic Ocean has a large moderating effect on temperatures. The average low in January is 22Â°F (-5Â°C), so there may be snow, freezing rain, or hail. However, it doesn't snow anywhere near as much as many other cities due to the effect of the ocean. There is only snowfall on 10 days or so per year, at the absolute maximum.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nMassachusetts' first governor, John Winthrop, famously called Boston a \"shining city on the hill,\" a reference to Jerusalem and a declaration of the original settlers' intent to build a utopian Christian colony. From the very beginning, the people who lived there declared their home to be one of the most important cities in the world. Considering that the American Revolution and modern democracy got their start thanks to Bostonians, and that Winthropâs quote is still used in modern political speech, one could argue that they were right!\n\nThe father of American jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. (Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes) once called the Boston statehouse \"the hub of the solar system,\" but common usage has expanded to the now-current ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hub of the Universe"]},". This half-serious term is all you need to know to understand Boston's complicated self-image.  Vastly important in American history, and for centuries the seat of the USA's social elite, Boston lost prominence in the early twentieth century, largely to the cities of New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. Over the past two decades, Boston has regained political, cultural, and economic importance.\n\nIn 1629, Reverend William Blackstone was the first English immigrant to arrive in the city. A year later, John Winthrop and the Massachusetts Bay Colony had followed. The Massachusetts Bay Colony were Puritan religious dissidents who had fled ",{"type":"[[","value":[["England"]]}," to find freedom in the New World. At the time the city was called Shawmut, a name coined by Native American settlers, however now a new settlement, Winthrop had decided to rename the city Boston after his hometown in England. Because of its easily-defended harbor and the fact that it is the closest port to Europe it rapidly assumed a leading role in the fledging ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New England"]]}," region, with a booming economy based on trade with the Caribbean and Europe.  The devastating ",{"type":"'''","value":["Fire of 1760"]}," destroyed much of the town, but within a few years the city had bounced back.\n\nBoston was also a city of great intellectual potential. Many statesmen had emerged in Boston along with prestigious Schools such as Harvard and the first public school in America, Boston Latin. With the founding of these schools as well as the first printing press in New England, Boston was becoming more of a colonial society.\n\nBostonians were the instigators of the independence movement in the 18th century and the city was the center of America's revolutionary activity during the Colonial period.  Several of the first Revolutionary War skirmishes were fought there, including the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Boston Massacre"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Boston Tea Party"]},", and the battles of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Lexington"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Concord"]}," -which were fought nearby. Soon after the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Battle of Bunker Hill"]},", Boston's direct involvement in the Revolution ended with the success of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Siege of Boston"]}," by George Washington.  For some time afterwards the city's political leaders continued to have a leading role in developing of the new country's system of government. The residents' ardent support of independence earned the city the nickname ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Cradle of Liberty"]},".\n\nThroughout the 19th century, Boston continued to grow rapidly, assimilating outlying towns into the metropolitan core. Its importance in American culture was inestimable, and its economic and literary elite, the so-called ",{"type":"'''","value":["Boston Brahmins"]}," assumed the mantle of aristocracy in the United States.  Their patronage of the arts and progressive social ideals was unprecedented in the New World, and often conflicted with the city's Puritan foundations.  They helped drive unprecedented scientific, educational and social change that would soon sweep the country. The Abolitionist movement, anesthesia and the telephone are a few examples of this.\n\nAt the same time, the city's working class swelled with immigrants from Europe. The huge ",{"type":"'''","value":["Irish"]}," influx made Boston one of the most important Irish cities in the world, in or out of Ireland.  Gradually the Irish laborer population climbed into city's upper class, evidenced no better than by the continued importance of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Kennedy family"]}," in national politics.\n\nFrom the early twentieth century until the 1970s, Boston's importance on the national stage waned. Cities in what was once the frontier, like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chicago"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Francisco"]]},", and later ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Los Angeles"]]},", shifted the nation's center of gravity away from liberty's cradle. In the past two decades, Boston's importance and influence has increased, due to growth in higher education, health care, high technology, and financial services. It remains America's higher educational center; during the school year, one in five Bostonians are university students. There are more college students per square foot in Boston than any other city in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nBoston's nicknames include \"Beantown\",  \"The Hub\" (shortened from Oliver Wendell Holmes' phrase 'The Hub of the Universe'), \"The City of Higher Learning\" (due to the plethora of universities and colleges in the Boston area) and - particularly in the 19th century - \"The Athens of America,\" on account of its great cultural and intellectual influence. If you don't want to stand out as a tourist, don't refer to Boston by any of these nicknames. Locals generally don't use any of them, except the heavy use of \"Hub\" in journalism (Boston takes up more headline space).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Visitor information"]},"\nThe Greater Boston Convention & Visitors Bureau maintains two visitor centers:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Boston Common Visitor Information Center"],["url=http:\/\/www.bostonusa.com"],["email=info@bostonusa.com"],["address=148 Tremont St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=at Winter; T: Park Street"],["phone=+1 617 536-4100"],["tollfree=+1-888-733-2678"],["fax="],["hours=M-Sa 8:30AM-5PM, Su 10AM-6PM"],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Shops at Prudential Visitor Information Center"],["url=http:\/\/www.bostonusa.com"],["email=info@bostonusa.com"],["address=800 Boylston St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Center Court; T: Prudential or Back Bay"],["phone=+1 617 536-4100"],["tollfree=+1-888-733-2678"],["fax="],["hours=9AM-5PM daily"],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\nThe National Park Service also maintains two visitor centers as many of the historic sites in Boston are considered part of the Boston National Historical Park:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Downtown Visitor Center"],["url=http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/bost"],["email="],["address=15 State St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=behind the Old State House between Devonshire and Washington; T: State Street"],["phone=+1 617 242-5642"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=9AM-5PM daily"],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Charlestown Navy Yard Visitor Center"],["url=http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/bost"],["email="],["address=Navy Yard Pier 1"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=next to the USS Constitution"],["phone=+1 617 242-5601"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=9AM-5PM daily"],["price="],["hoursextra=until 6PM in July and August"],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["Boston Logan International Airport"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.massport.com\/logan Boston Logan International Airport"]}]},", +1-800-23-LOGAN (56426), (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["BOS"]]},") is the main gateway to Boston and New England.

Logan is a modern, relatively clean, and easy to get around airport, with terminals directly connected: A and B are fairly close to each other, it is possible to walk from C to E, and all are connected by above-ground enclosed walkways like spokes to the hub of the central parking garage. Free MassPort shuttle buses do the loop around the terminals (number 11) and also go to the Airport subway station on the MBTA Blue Line (number 55; in peak hours two shortened routes, 22 and 33, connect the station with terminals A-B and C-E respectively). Logan has a bevy of dining options considering its size, although they're typically expensive, even for Boston. It also has limited shopping facilities. Security is typically tight, as is true at most major American airports, and you can expect the TSA to be thorough, although reasonably efficient and quick, especially compared to other airports such as New York's JFK.\n\nIt is the major airport for New England and provides frequent non-stop service to most major cities in the United States and almost all major European airports. Boston is a hub for low cost carrier JetBlue Airways, and is also served domestically by Alaska, American, Delta, Frontier, Southwest, Spirit, United, and US Airways. There is a wide choice of flights to Canada (both Canadian and domestic carriers) and Caribbean (Delta, JetBlue and US Airways). The European carriers that fly to Boston from their hubs include British Airways and Virgin Atlantic (London-Heathrow), Air France\/KLM (Paris, Amsterdam), Alitalia (Rome), Lufthansa (Frankfurt, Munich), Aer Lingus (Dublin, Shannon), Swiss (Zurich), Icelandair (Reykjavik), SATA (Azores, Lisbon) and Iberia (Madrid). Getting to Boston from Asia used to require at least a one stop connection, but JAL now flies non-stop from Tokyo-Narita, and both Turkish Airlines and Emirates announced plans to start direct service to Logan from Istanbul and Dubai respectively in the spring of 2014.

If you're not driving or being picked up, you'll need to take a taxi if you are at the airport when the T is not running.

You should research your route and inform your driver what route you want to go, or look up the traffic conditions on your smartphone if possible, to avoid being cheated. Note that a $7.50 origination surcharge from the airport is lawful and permissible (including tolls). There are always unlicensed taxis or vans at Logan, so if you see a taxi or van without what looks like official livery, it's probably fake and you might want to consider a metered taxi unless there are no other options. That said, there is no one livery for Boston taxis, so your taxi may be blue and white or checkered green just depending on who you get.

If you use a flight planning tool, Logan will typically come up as your only option just due to the sheer size of Logan in comparison to the other regional airports.\n\nHanscom Field (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["BED"]]},"), off Interstate 95 near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bedford (Massachusetts)"],["Bedford"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lexington (Massachusetts)"],["Lexington"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Burlington (Massachusetts)"],["Burlington"]]},", northwest of Boston mostly serves ",{"type":"'''","value":["general aviation"]}," traffic - although the airport has at various times been served with commuter flights to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Trenton"],["Trenton, New Jersey"]]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["TTN"]]},").\n\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.massport.com\/hanscom-worcester-airports\/Worcester%20Regional%20Airport\/Overview.aspx Worcester Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["ORH"]]},"), 40 miles west of Boston and also, like Logan and Bedford, under control of MassPort, is in a state of constant negotiation of contracts for commercial traffic, which so far failed to produce stable results.

Parking at MBTA commuter rail and terminal subway locations is usually cheaper than parking in the city. In particular, the Riverside (Grove Street) stop at the end of the Green D line is right off I-95, and is $5.75 to park ALL DAY. You can even park overnight for $6.75 each extra day. Stations on the south end of the Red Line (Braintree, Quincy Adams, etc...) are $7. Commuter rail stations are even cheaper. See the Public Transit section in the \"Get around\" section below.\n\nBoston has two major highways entering it, I-93 and I-90 (the Massachusetts Turnpike, or \"Mass Pike\", or just \"the Pike\"; locals do not usually call it \"I-90\", though they will typically know what you are referring to). I-93 enters the city from the north and the south; the section running from Boston southward is usually referred to as the \"Southeast Expressway\" (or just \"the Expressway\") but the northern section is just \"93\" (sometimes called the Northern Expressway, although this is much less frequent than I-93 south of Boston's tunnels) The Pike enters Boston from the west. The Mass Pike is a toll road - expect to pay $1.25 to enter the city via the Pike, in addition to the tolls charged when arriving at the I-90 \/ I-95 interchange in Weston, just outside the city (variable based on distance travelled, max price is $3.85 if you drive all the way from the automatic ticket machines near the New York border). Also, if you enter The Pike in East Boston (at Logan Airport) the toll is $3.50. There are minor roads, of course, that enter Boston as well, including Route 9 (Old Worcester Turnpike), Route 2, and US 1. Another major highway, I-95, encircles the Boston area. Be aware that the vast majority of locals refer to I-95 as \"Route 128\", which is I-95's former name, so they may not know what is being referred to. Route 128 is still reflected to on signs with I-95 and its signage only due to public pressure on MassDOT. It is rare for traffic reporters to not omit the I-95 and I-93 designations from this stretch. Past Canton and I-93's southern end signs no longer reflect the 128 designation, although traffic reporters and much of the public still call it 128. North of I-95's departure from the half-beltway in Peabody on the North Shore the road is still designated as 128 to its ending. Adding to this mass confusion US-1 follows the southern part of the road, and only white roadside signs indicate the old 128 designation.\n\nThere are many car rental places around Boston, but one of the most unique is Zipcar, an hourly car rental service. If you don't plan to do much driving, this may be an economical alternative to owning a car. If you want to use Zipcar, you should try signing up in advance (students of universities in Boston may be able to get a discount). Rental fees and taxes differ between Boston and Cambridge, but the rental agencies at Logan Airport (in East Boston) are still usually less expensive and have a greater fleet of cars available.\n\nIn addition to the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Massachusetts Turnpike"]}," (I-90), the Sumner Tunnel is a toll road (coming from the airport only), along with the Ted Williams Tunnel (from airport only), and the Tobin Bridge (southbound\/from the North Shore only).\n\nIf driving on a major highway during rush hour, do not be surprised to see cars driving in the breakdown lane on the shoulder. This is permitted in certain areas, at certain times, as indicated by signs along the road.\n\nAs a general rule, especially as a tourist unfamiliar with the city, alternatives are favored over driving - even when just getting in or out of the city. Boston is one of the densest major cities in the U.S. - perfect for walking, biking, or using the collection of mass transit systems known as the ",{"type":"'''","value":["T"]},". Driving can be confusing and dangerous with numerous one way streets, narrow roads, and continuous road construction. Driving conditions have improved after the completion of the infamous Big Dig, but it is still not recommended to those unfamiliar with the area.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.mbta.com\/schedules_and_maps\/boats\/ MBTA ferries"]}," from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hingham"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hull (Massachusetts)"],["Hull"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Quincy (Massachusetts)"],["Quincy"]]},"."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cruise ships"]]}," dock at the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.massport.com\/ports\/cruis.html Black Falcon Cruise Terminal"]}]},", One Black Falcon Av., ",{"type":"''","value":["+1"]}," 617-330-1500.

While many other American cities have their streets laid out in a grid (",{"type":"[[","value":[["New York City"],["New York"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chicago"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Indianapolis"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Philadelphia"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Phoenix"]]},"), or along a river, lake, or other geographical feature (",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Orleans"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cleveland"]]},"), the modern streets of Boston are a twisty and seemingly incomprehensible maze.  Boston in the 1600s was a narrow peninsula surrounded by farmland and distant settlements.  Landfill, urban expansion, waves of radical economic change, and new technologies have seen sensible street patterns added on to and collide in less sensible ways.  Due to dense development, the older street patterns have largely remained in place without being adapted to their modern surroundings.  ",{"type":"'''","value":["In this way, Boston is more similar to old European cities than most typical large American cities"]}," that were geometrically planned, expanded into unsettled land, or were mainly settled in the late 20th century. Streets in Boston not only turn of their own volition, but often vanish for no particular reason or change names. If you intend to drive in Boston, a GPS or smartphone with GPS capabilities are essential, because Boston streets and avenues have no rhyme or reason to their layout, and signs are often conspicuously lacking.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Driving is to be avoided"]}," if possible, due to traffic congestion, poor parking options, high driving-associated costs, the complexity of navigation, notoriously aggressive drivers, brazen jaywalkers, difficult-to-follow city rules and signage, and the simple fact that Boston, with the exception of neighborhoods on the periphery such as Dorchester and Mattapan, is very compact.\n\nAs an alternative (in fair weather), walking is usually preferable in terms of ease, cost, and comfort. Boston is an all right city to walk because most destinations are very close together, and downtown rapid transit stops, or T stops, are frequent.\n\nSignage is generally poor, and the names of major streets are usually unmarked when crossing minor streets. There are many one-way streets, which may be difficult to identify when turning.  Street names are duplicated in different neighborhoods (due to municipal consolidations in the 1800s and early 1900s).  Even Bostonians who lived there all their life can easily get lost.  Navigating from \"square\" to \"square\" (major intersections but rarely actually square or really any consistent shape) is one navigational technique.  Some parts of the city are difficult to reach from other nearby parts, prompting the local expression, \"Ya cain't get theyah from hee-ah!\" (\"You can't get there from here!\")\n\nAvoid driving at morning or evening rush hour; highways and streets can become quite congested. Peak times vary, depending on relative distance from downtown. Public transit also becomes very crowded during rush hour, and just before and after major sporting events and public celebrations. Baseball games, other major sporting events, and graduations may also cause significant driving congestion.\n\nIf you do choose to drive, be prepared to avoid double-parked vehicles or poorly parked vehicles blocking lanes, and be wary of lanes which may suddenly become parking lanes or shift or disappear entirely as you cross intersections. \"Left lane must turn\" and other traffic directions are often written only on the road itself and therefore may be routinely blocked from sight by other vehicles in heavy traffic, thus last-second lane changes are unavoidable without foreknowledge of the roads. Such changes may be the cause of anger or disputes, so it may be good to wave or request a lane change politely.\n\nWhen changing lanes, be wary of pedestrians and cyclists, as well as other drivers, since they may cross, split lanes, or even run lights unexpectedly. Massachusetts law requires vehicles to yield to pedestrians, whether or not they're crossing legally. Bicycles are treated as vehicles, and may occupy an entire lane if there is no bike lane. As in any city, be prepared to stop when following a taxi driver, and look for pedestrians to anticipate taxi behavior: taxis will not only stop at fares but also stop at nothing to get to them first. When stopping yourself, use your hazards to clearly indicate that you are stopping as a courtesy to other drivers, many of whom are young students and may be inexperienced with city driving themselves. In terms of the law: if you encounter a rotary, remember that Massachusetts state law gives the right of way to traffic ",{"type":"''","value":["in"]}," a rotary, also known as a roundabout in other parts in the world.\n\nDo not pass stopped trolleys on the right; do not try to squeeze past a bus without changing lanes entirely to avoid sharing their lane (you should not pass any vehicle while sharing a lane and buses have large blind spots); and be wary that the law may require you to come to a complete stop and wait for the pedestrian to finish crossing entirely. Be careful also not to pass a yellow school bus with red flashing lights as passing before or after may still draw you a citation (this rule may be ignored, even by police, if due caution is observed by the driver, but those who ignore it may still draw a serious citation). Finally, since you may cross train tracks in Boston, be aware that they may be particularly slippery and icy, possibly dragging you off course as you cross them if you do not grip the steering wheel firmly.\n\nThe only toll road in the area is the Massachusetts Turnpike (Interstate 90), with various prices depending on entrance and exit points. Other tolls include the Ted Williams and Sumner Tunnels, each of which charges $3.50 when coming back from Logan Airport into downtown.  The Tobin Bridge on Route 1 headed southbound toward downtown charges $3. Have cash on hand for these roads as checks and credit card are not accepted there. FastLane and E-Z Pass are also accepted.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Parking"]},"\nParking can be expensive, up to $40\/day downtown on a weekday, though $20 and $7 deals can be found if you are willing to walk.  Most cheap or free street parking is permitted as resident only and requires a special sticker, or is metered and has a 2-hour time limit.\n\nParallel parking is a necessary skill for street parking.  Believe it or not, you can park in a space that is only a few inches larger than your car, if you don't mind scrapes on your bumpers and take advantages of the bounciness of cars' suspensions.\n\nGarages are located at Quincy Market, the Aquarium, the new State Street Financial Center, the Theater District and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boston Common"]]},".  There are three levels of parking under the Common.  The garage is very clean and its central location makes it a good starting point for a day trip in the city.  To get in and out of the garage, there are four pavilions on the Common; each has stairs and an elevator.  Once out of the garage, the Park Street and Boylston Street T stops are only a two or three minute walk away.\n\nAs a rule, if you think you may be illegally parked, you probably are. Read the street signs very carefully. Watch for street cleaning, resident-only parking zones, and commercial parking zones - all of which will vary depending on the day and time. Parking meters are enforced heavily throughout the city.  Meters in different parts of the city will turn off at different times (i.e. 8PM downtown or 6PM in many other neighborhoods). A broken meter entitles you to the posted time limit without having to pay.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By public transit"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:MBTA Boston subway map.png"],["thumb"],["375px"],["The rapid transit lines of the MBTA system.  (Bus, commuter rail, and boat not shown.)"]]}," \nPublic transit in Boston is plentiful for an American city of its size, and is useful in getting around the city, especially considering the issues with driving.  A single public transit agency serves the Boston metropolitan area, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (\"MBTA\", or \"the T\" for short). The MBTA is the fourth-largest transit system in the U.S. For complete schedules, maps, and other information, see their ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.mbta.com official website"]},".\n\nIt is important to note that ",{"type":"'''","value":["\"Inbound\" means toward Park Street or State and \"Outbound\" means away from Park Street or State."]},"\n\nAfter decades of using tokens for fare payment, the entire MBTA system was converted in 2007 to an electronic CharlieCard and CharlieTicket system.  Dispensing machines at all stations accept cash, credit cards, and debit cards.  If you go straight to a dispensing machine, you'll get a paper CharlieTicket with magnetic stripe.  If you have time, first ask an attendant at any underground station for a plastic CharlieCard, which is a contactless \"smart card\".  The Card is free and will give you a discount on all T and bus fares, and it's the only way to get free transfers to and from buses. If you think you'll be boarding the T many times you may wish to purchase a day or week LinkPass (Sold at standard machines for $11.00 and $18.00, respectively). Note that these do not allow rapid repeated use at the same station, for a group, for instance. In general, a CharlieCard should be considered a must for its convenience (you can leave it in your wallet), decreased fares, and free or discounted transfers. Most passes (but not one and seven day passes) can be loaded onto a ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.mbta.com\/fares_and_passes\/passes\/ CharlieCard"]},". Unfortunately, CharlieCards are oftentimes not available at stations. However, almost all 7-11 convenience stores in the Boston area sell them, and you can find other places to buy CharlieCards on the MBTA's website.\n\nBicycles are sometimes possible to transport on the MBTA. Bikes are allowed on the Blue, Red, and Orange T lines except at peak hours, but are not allowed on the Green and Silver lines.  Bikes are always allowed on MBTA buses that are equipped with bike racks. The MBTA is currently installing bike racks on many bus routes - check the MBTA website for the latest updates. Bikes are allowed on MBTA boats and ferries at any time.  On commuter rail trains, they are allowed anytime except weekday rush hours, as noted on individual train line schedules.\n\nThe MBTA system consists of several components: T, bus, water shuttles, and commuter rail.\n\nFull-color system maps are available at major stations; you may need to ask an agent if you would like one.  They are extremely useful for locals and travelers getting a bit off the beaten track, because they show all bus, rapid transit, commuter rail, and boat lines. Most of the T maps you will see only show the rapid transit lines, which are identified by color.  If you have a color printer, you can make one yourself by printing the PDF version online.

Its long distance and frequent grade crossings cause dispatchers to express trains frequently. B stops are extremely close together, even for Boston. Expect a journey on the B branch to take a while. Make sure to press the stop tape to request your stops, as many drivers won't stop unless they are requested past Boston University or even past Kenmore.\n\n",{"type":"''","value":["The C branch"]}," is a service to Cleveland Circle via Beacon Street. This line is primarily in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brookline"]]},". Its right of way is mainly surrounded by local businesses and residential structures. Like with the B branch, stops are very close together, upon occasion literally only 1 block apart.\n\n",{"type":"''","value":["The D branch"]}," is a service to Riverside Station, an inter-modal station in Newton, MA, via the Highland Branch. A former street care right of way from the 1800s. The right of way is completely grade separated (does not intersect or run along streets) making transportation faster, with stops being further apart.\n\n",{"type":"''","value":["The E branch"]}," is a service to VA Medical Center and Heath Street, via Huntington Avenue. This line services the Prudential Center, and Boston's Symphony Hall. Along with many universities along the right of way, including the world famous Longwood Medical Area, which is a commercial and education complex offering some of the most advanced health care in the world, along with research centers. Also the Museum of Fine Arts Boston is accessible via the Museum of Fine Arts stop, sometimes announced as MFA or Museum on the trolley. However, the E branch is less accessible and frequent from downtown, and it's nigh impossible to transfer to other C lines from the E branch.\n\nThe letters are not assigned to coincide with any particular reference to the route of the branch. It is labeled A-E (A disbanded, now the 57 bus) from north to south. Cleveland Circle (C), Reservoir (D), and Chestnut Hill Ave (B) stops are all in walking distance and provide a convenient spot to switch between the lines; however a second fare is required.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["The Red Line"]},"  splits in two directions at the JFK\/UMass station going south that are known as the Braintree and Ashmont branches, the latter of which connects to a streetcar line to Mattapan.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["The Orange Line"]},", the eldest of the rapid transit lines in Boston, is service from Malden, MA to Jamaica Plain. It services the City of Malden, Charlestown, Bunker Hill Community College, North Station, the Haymarket area, the Financial District, Downtown Crossing, New England Medical Center, Roxbury, and Jamaica Plain.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["The Blue Line"]},", named as such because it crosses under the Boston Harbor and goes to Revere Beach, is a former street car line converted to rapid transit. It services East Boston, the Airport, and Revere.\n\nThe T system is slightly confusing in that directions are often marked \"inbound\" and \"outbound\", rather than with a destination.  \"Inbound\" means \"into the center of Boston\", where all four lines converge at four stops: State (Blue and Orange), Park Street (Red and Green), Government Center (Blue and Green), and Downtown Crossing (Orange and Red). \"Outbound\" means \"away from the center of Boston\".  Once one is ",{"type":"''","value":["in"]}," the center, signs generally give the direction (\"eastbound\") or the last stop on the line in that direction (\"Alewife\").  All trains are signed with the last stop in the direction they are headed, and this is the best way to know if you are going in the right direction.\n\nNote that ",{"type":"'''","value":["most Green Line trains do not go all the way to the end of the line at Lechmere"]},"; most turn around either at North Station or Government Center. If you are traveling farther than Government Center, your best bet is to get on the first train that comes, and then wait on the platform at the stop where you are forced to leave the train until the next Lechmere or North Station train arrives. (Depending where you are, Lechmere trains might not stop there.) Only trains coming from the E Branch will proceed to Lechmere, unless otherwise noted. From North Station or Haymarket, it's a fairly short walk to Lechmere.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["T service generally does not run between 1AM and 5AM"]},".  (The same goes for the commuter rail lines - usually midnight or before.) Each line (Green, Blue, etc.) has a \"last train\" time, starting at one end of the line and going to the other.  Check the schedule in advance if you are going to be out late.  Sometimes the last train is delayed due to passenger load or the need to wait for the last connection from another line, so you might get lucky if you are running late.  Check with a T employee near the fare gates to see if you've missed the last train or not. A general rule of thumb is to be in the station by midnight to safely catch the last train. A consequence of this is that taxis can be extremely difficult to hail after 2AM when most of the bars close, especially in touristy areas such as Fanueil Hall.\n\nUnlimited-ride T and bus passes are available from the MBTA.  If you're going to be riding a lot around town, these are worth investigating.  See the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.mbta.com\/fares_and_passes\/ link"]}," for complete fare information on passes.  Buy a CharlieCard 1 day pass for $11 or a 7 day unlimited pass for $18. The 7-Day LinkPass is valid for 7 days from the date and time of purchase. The LinkPass gives you unlimited travel on T, Local Bus, Inner Harbor Ferry, and Commuter Rail Zone 1A.  (Note that Commuter Rail and boats do not accept CharlieCards, so you must use a CharlieTicket for these services.)\n\nIf using a CharlieCard, the cost of a one-way ride on the T is $2.00 plus free T and local bus transfers. Otherwise, it costs $2.50 per ride if done on a Charlie Ticket or paying by cash. This will get you to most destinations. Parking at the Alewife station on the Red line is ample but will cost you $7 each time you park, and $8 overnight. Riverside Station just off I-95 has plentiful parking for $6 all day.  Additional suburban parking is available in Quincy, Braintree, and at many Commuter Rail stops.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Bus"]},"\nRegular bus service (the vast majority of buses) is usually slower than rapid transit, but is also cheaper and may take you closer to your final destination.  Express buses are faster, more expensive, and travel longer distances.  CharlieCard users get free transfers and pay $1.50 for regular bus, $3.50 for Inner Express, and $5 for Outer Express (check the schedule to know which line is which).  Charlie Ticket or cash customers pay $2.00 for regular bus, $4.50 for Inner Express, and $6.50 for Outer Express, with no free transfers.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Water shuttle"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:BostonHarborTaxi.jpg"],["thumb"],["Water Taxi"]]},"\nThe MBTA runs a number of ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.mbta.com\/schedules_and_maps\/boats\/ water shuttles"]},", but the most useful for tourists is the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.mbta.com\/schedules_and_maps\/boats\/lines\/?route=F4 shuttle"]}," from Long Wharf to Navy Yard, which costs $1.70.  This provides a convenient connection between the USS Constitution Museum and the area around Faneuil Hall and the New England Aquarium.  There's also a shuttle from Long Wharf to Logan Airport, but it runs relatively infrequently, so the Blue Line is your best bet for getting between these two destinations.\n\nThere are also non-MBTA ",{"type":"'''","value":["public ferries"]}," available from several ports, notably the Aquarium and Long Wharf, and a water taxi service on the waterfront. The Boston Harbor Islands, an interesting destination for wildlife and scenery, are primarily accessed through private water shuttles which run every 30 minutes out of a stretch of the Rose Kennedy Greenway.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Commuter rail"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.mbta.com\/schedules_and_maps\/rail\/ Commuter rail"]}," in Boston is primarily used for traveling to towns outside of the city. Due to its limited frequency compared to the T, it is not generally recommended for travel within the city itself. An exception is travel between Back Bay Station and South Station, which is served by 5 commuter rail branches on weekdays and is free one way. Commuter rail fares range from $1.70 to $7.75 one way, although any ticket to or from the city is at least $4.25.  Tickets can be bought on board trains, but at a slight surcharge. Passengers can ride for free from Back Bay to South Station, but must buy a ticket for $1.70 to travel from South Station to Back Bay.\n\nTrains heading north of the city leave from North Station, while those heading south or west leave from South Station. Both stations have connections to the T: North Station is on the Green and Orange Lines, and South Station is on the Red and Silver Lines.  The two stations are ",{"type":"''","value":["not"]}," directly connected: you cannot board a train north of the city and take it to a point south of the city.  Such a journey will require a T ride in-between train trips to make the connection.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nYour current alternative to late-night public transit is a taxi.  Taxis can be hailed at any significant street corner, such as Kenmore Square or Copley Square.  Expect to spend at least $5 and possibly up to $30 in the immediate surroundings (this includes the initial fare, a small tip for the driver, small one-way streets, bad traffic, construction, tolls for bridges, tolls for tunnels, tolls for the Mass Pike, and any wait time). To get further out of Boston, expect to spend much more (for example, from the airport to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wellesley"]]},", a Boston suburb, would be around $80, which includes the actual driving and tolls along the way). Fun fact, as of summer 2009, Boston has the most expensive taxis of any major American city.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By foot"]},"\nBoston's downtown core is compact and easily walkable. Most tourist attractions can be visited on foot, although some neighborhoods require rail and\/or bus connections. Take note that while jaywalking is technically illegal, the fine is $1 and tickets haven't been issued for decades.  However, if you cross against signals just remember to watch out for stray bikes, cars, and some unusual traffic patterns you won't be used to.\n\nThe climate is cold from December to April, and the city is the most windy in America. Snow can also be an obstacle.\n\nIf it's late at night, or you feel you cannot deal with the cost of a taxi or the wait involved with the MBTA, then Boston is a relatively small, relatively safe city and walking is an option. Just remember to use the same sense you would in any other city.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bicycle"]},"\nMany Boston residents use bicycling as their primary mode of transit all year round, and Boston's small size and relative flatness make biking an appealing way to get around.  Boston lacks many amenities for bicyclists, however, as the roads are covered with potholes and frequently absent of designated bicycle lanes or bicycle racks, so ",{"type":"'''","value":["visitors wishing to travel by bicycle should have excellent urban riding skills"]}," prior to renting a bicycle. Cambridge tends to have more bicycle lanes and racks, though many streets still lack them. Riding on the sidewalk is illegal in the city of Cambridge, and frowned upon in Boston, and being well-lit in the evenings is important both for following regulations and for being safe.  Recent efforts by Mayor Thomas Menino promise increased city investment in bicycling as a viable mode of transportation, and the mayor himself has taken up biking around town.\n\nA central transit for bikers in Boston is the Southwest Corridor Bike Path, a major park\/bike way placed along a route once slated for a major freeway system. This runs parallel to the T's Orange Line and connects Forest Hills to the Back Bay. This is an excellent means of transit if you intend on staying in Jamaica Plain.\n\nIn 2011, Boston launched ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.thehubway.com  Hubway"]},", a bike sharing system very similar to those in Washington D.C. and New York City. As of 2014, there are 140 stations and 1,300 bicycles; visitors can purchase a pass for one day or three days, or those staying longer can purchase a monthly or annual membership.

Most restaurants close by 10 or 11PM, even in college neighborhoods such as Allston and Brookline. Bars stay open till 2AM for drinking but their kitchens usually close at midnight or earlier. Exceptions are found in Chinatown, where several eateries serve their full menu till 2AM or later, and in the South End, where dining until midnight is possible even early in the week. If you're planning a long night, though, it's probably best to plan ahead and buy some snacks in advance.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nBoston has a thriving nightlife and is known to be a 'drinking' town. There are many venues that cater to college students, businesspeople, sports fanatics, and many others. There is NO happy hour in Massachusetts. Bar Hopping is very easy and commonly done.\n\nThat said, if you're taking the subway or buses back to your hotel, you may have to call it a night early lest you miss the last train by mistake. And if you have people under 21 with you, you're going to have trouble finding a place that will let your group in; pretty much every bar\/club in and around town is 21+.\n\nWith a large Irish population, Boston has a number of very good Irish pubs.  Many tourists look for an authentic \"Boston Irish Pub\".  A good rule of thumb is if the establishment has a neon shamrock in the window, it is not an authentic Irish pub.  For nightlife and club listings look for \"Stuff @ Night\" or \"The Weekly Dig\" in the free boxes on the street. The annual \"Best of Boston\" issue of the free Improper Bostonian is always a good bet for finding the kind of establishment that you are in the mood for.\n\nPlaces densest in bars include:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Canal Street (just south of TD BankNorth Garden)"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Boylston Street"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boston\/Fenway-Kenmore#Drink"],["Landsdowne Street and Fenway area"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boston\/Allston-Brighton#Drink"],["Harvard Ave\/Brighton Ave in Allston"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cambridge (Massachusetts)#Drink"],["Central Square in Cambridge and Harvard Square in Cambridge"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" Seaport\/Waterfront - specifically Northern Ave, where there are now several popular new bars with roof decks and patios that are packed in good weather"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Faneuil Hall"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Dive Bars"]},"\nThere are many dive bars in ",{"type":"'''","value":["Boston"]},".\n\nIf you are in the North End or near the Banknorth Garden, go to ",{"type":"'''","value":["Sullivan's Tap"]},".

The commercials should really be \"Boston runs on Dunkin.\"  Every Bostonian knows that \"Dunks\" is for coffee, not donuts - trust us.  Dunkins is very popular, but coffee aficionados will consider it little more than coffee flavored sugar water, and will want to look elsewhere.  Quality and service at a Dunkin' Donuts is really hit or miss depending on the location.    Au Bon Pain's 200 stores began in Boston and are also common. Starbucks are, of course, plentiful.\n\nBoston does, however, have some outstanding independent coffee shops as well, including the Boston Common Coffee Co. with multiple locations including one near Boston Common. Also, Pavement Cafe.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nAll hotels are listed in the individual district articles.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nCrime and other hazards in Boston are low for a major American city.\n\nSome neighborhoods (especially Roxbury, Mattapan, and Dorchester) are more dangerous than average, and extra care should be taken there.  It is even better to avoid walking in these areas at night if possible.  Also avoid public parks after dark (except for special events).\n\nDangers related to alcohol consumption are not uncommon, such as fights and drunk driving. Be especially careful when there is a Red Sox and New York Yankees baseball game in progress. Wearing Yankees gear in any part of town (even if you're not from NY), especially in the Fenway area, is invitation to be verbally harassed by the locals. For example, instead of the usual \"Yankees Suck\" phrase, you might be told that ",{"type":"''","value":["you suck!"]},". Although generally harmless and in good fun, it is not unheard of for these encounters to escalate into physical altercations, especially when there is excess alcohol consumption involved. If you find yourself in this situation, you might find it wise to walk away and\/or leave the area rather than try to hold your ground.\n\nCare should be taken as well if you decide to go clubbing on Landsdowne Street, the Theatre District, Chinatown, or Faneuil Hall.  As mentioned above, the more dangerous parts of Boston are generally not visited or even seen by tourists, but there are a few mildly dangerous locales that you should be aware of if you plan on enjoying Boston's nightlife.  In Kenmore Square, be especially careful on Landsdowne Street as muggers and pickpockets are becoming more common and also eat in the darker areas near Ipswich Street at the end of the strip.  In Chinatown, be very careful if you wander off Kneeland Street.  There are a plethora of little alleyways and inlets where muggers operate.  Faneuil Hall is generally safe, but not without its share of fights and petty robberies.\n\nThe safest place to have a night on the town in Boston is definitely Boylston Street in the Back Bay, around the Prudential Center area.  There are plenty of bars, pubs, clubs, and restaurants that cater to the college, professional, and upscale crowd, greatly reducing the likelihood of crime.  Also, this area is within short walking distance from most of the major hotels in the city.\n\nStill, Boston is a reasonably safe city known more for its schools and history than for its crime, petty or otherwise.\n\nBoston's subway system, the MBTA, is generally safe compared to other major cities. Green Line trains and the northern half of the Red Line are mostly used by college students and young professionals moving to and from the immediate suburbs.  Caution is still advisable late at night, especially when leaving the station or the train.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["If there is an emergency, dial 911"]},", a free call, from any telephone for police, medical, and fire services.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\nGreater Boston uses ",{"type":"'''","value":["10-digit dialing"]},".
