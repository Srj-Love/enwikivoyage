An American seaman over 100 years ago disembarked one day from his merchant marine ship to a small fishing village in Davao Oriental.  Seeing an old man walking with a cane, the seaman asked \"what is this place called?\".  The seaman pointed at the sand below his feet.  \n\nThe old man, however, thought the seaman was pointing at his cane.  Responding with a smile, the old pinoy pounded the sand with his cane and pronounced loudly \"Bahstaan!\" which means \"cane\" in Davaoenu, the dialect in the area.\n\nThe seaman smiled and said \"Boston?  wonderful!\"  Henceforth the village was always known as Boston, in the province of Davao Oriental Mindanao Philippines.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nlovley bar called esko , its historical in its own way , the building is now 17 years old\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Philippines"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Boston, Davao Oriental"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["7.8666666666667"],["126.36666666667"]]}]
