At the height of the copper mining-led boom, Arawa was thought to be the richest town in Papua New Guinea outside of the capital.

This is very evident today as it is certainly the most bustling town in Bougainville. The airport and the majority of places to stay are all here. Buka is located on the island of the same name, just to the north of main Bougainville.

In 1885 it came under German administration as part of German New Guinea. Australia occupied it in 1914, and administered it from 1918 until the Japanese invaded in 1942, and then again from 1945 until PNG independence in 1975, as a United Nations mandatory power.\n\nA large mine was established at Panguna in the early 1970s by Bougainville Copper Limited, a subsidiary of Australian mining giant Rio Tinto. The formation of this mine was to prove perhaps the most controversial and formative event in the island's history. Disputes over the environmental impact, financial benefits, and social change brought by the mine renewed a dormant secessionist movement. The independence of Bougainville (Republic of North Solomons) was unsuccessfully proclaimed in 1975 and in 1990.\n\nIn 1988 the Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA) increased their activity significantly. The Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF) attempted to put down the rebellion, and the conflict escalated into an all-out bloody civil war. The PNGDF retreated from permanent positions on Bougainville in 1990, but continued military action. The war claimed an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 lives (an eighth of the indigenous population).\n\nThe conflict ended in 1997, after negotiations brokered by New Zealand, and a peace agreement finalised in 2000 provided for the establishment of an Autonomous Bougainville Government, and for a referendum in the future on whether the island should become politically independent. Elections for the first Autonomous Government were held in May and June 2005.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Terrain"]},"\nA key attraction of Bougainville is its volcanic landscape.

It is extremely humid throughout the year, with a mean temperature of 27 °C (80 °F).   Although seasons are not pronounced, June through August is the cooler period, and northwesterly winds from November until April bring more frequent rainfall, and occasional squalls or cyclones.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Tourist information"]},"\nPerhaps surprisingly, there is a tourist information office at Buka.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Tourism Development Office of the Autonomous Region of Bougainville"],["url="],["email=commerce.dib@global.net.pg"],["address=PO Box 3,\nBuka Island"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+675 9739613"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nThere are several indigenous languages in Bougainville.
