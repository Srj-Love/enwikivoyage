What perhaps distinguishes it most from other cities of similar size in the United States, however, is its status as a mecca for serious athletes, many of whom have made their home here for the conditioning advantages of high altitude, combined with businesses, facilities, and a community that provides opportunities for serious training and competition. Even the average nine-to-five Boulderite is much more likely than the average American to be a serious climber, cyclist, runner, skier, etc., and you will see the difference as you're about town.\n\nBoulder is situated in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Front Range"]]}," region of Colorado and is virtually adjacent to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Denver"]]},", except for its buffer of Open Space Parks ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/joomla.ci.boulder.co.us\/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1167&Itemid=1085"]}," which border the city and provide it shelter from its growing surroundings.  This reflects that it is the \"front door\" to the mountainous country to the west, with many outdoor attractions, including a medium sized ski resort less than an hour from the city limits, and also the fact that there are significant cultural differences between Boulder and Denver beyond its liberal politics.\n\nBoulder is known for its outdoors and the residents with one of the healthiest lifestyles in America. It is very true, no matter what the weather, there are always people outdoors; running, biking, walking, hiking. It has a great atmosphere and beautiful sights.\n\nLiving in Boulder is very expensive. Along with being one of the most active towns in America, it is right up there with the living expense.
