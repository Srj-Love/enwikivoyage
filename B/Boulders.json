There are larger and more scenic beaches around, as Boulders, which gets its name from the large boulders surrounding it, is fairly small, although it is often sheltered from the prevailing winds.

It's possible to do a circular route, driving past Boulders on the east coast, and along the west coast of the peninsula in the reverse direction.\n\nThe easiest route is to drive south on the M3 (De Waal Drive) from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cape Town"]]},". At the end of the highway, turn left, and about 500m on, turn right onto the M4 (Main Road) along the east coast of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cape Peninsula"]]},". After passing through ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Simon's Town"]]}," turn left down Bellevue Road opposite the Country Club - you will see a brown sign directing you to the parking lot at the end of the road. Please be careful, because the road is quite narrow and there is the danger of accidents when going out again. The penguins here have adapted to the constant flow of humans coming to see them, so they certainly won't make way.\n\nA more scenic alternative is to take the M3 south from Cape Town. At the end of the highway, turn right, and about 800m on (through one traffic light), turn left onto Ou Kaapse Weg. Cross the scenic mountain pass (you can stop for a view at the top, turning off at the Silvermine sign). On the other side, continue straight, through two traffic lights. You'll cross Black Hill, a smaller mountain pass, with views of the Indian Ocean. You descend and reach the coast road. Turn right, and continue to Simonstown, as above.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Train"]},"\nTake a ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.capemetrorail.co.za MetroRail"]}," suburban train from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cape Town"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Simon's Town"]]},".

Although they attract hundreds of thousands of tourists every year, they can be a menace to the local inhabitants. The penguins do not stick to ",{"type":"''","value":["their"]}," beach, but like to go on safari, and can occasionally be found in neighbouring gardens and houses.

Alternatively, entry for those with Wild Cards is free. See ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.wildinafrica.com Wild In Africa"]}," for more information about the Wild Cards for local and international tourists.\n\nOnce you have parked your car at the parking lot, pay the entry fee, and go either to Boulders Beach to enjoy a relaxed time, swimming together with penguins or walk further on and you will get to a spotting place, where you will be able to see most of the penguins from a small distance.\n\nGoing to the beach is an adventure especially in summer, when it is warm and when you will share most of your time with penguins in the water. You can also climb around to get to a less crowded part of the beach. Please do NOT try to catch or touch the penguins. They are already distracted from their natural way of life by tourists and they can easily bite off a finger! Going to the beach means getting up early, because only a limited number of people are allowed onto the beach and it can be full by 10 or 11AM.\n\nThough you will see penguins here all year round you will see less during September to October as they will be spending most of their time out at sea feeding up for moulting season. Moulting season is from November to December. In January adults will spend a lot of time out at sea again, feeding up for breeding season between February and August.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nPlay a game of golf at the minigolf course next to parking lot.\n\nThe sandy beach is one of the few that is often sheltered from the strong winds that batter the Peninsula, and the water is warm and calm for swimming with the penguins.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nYou can buy souvenirs at the nearby stalls and shops.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Penguin Point Restaurant"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=At Boulders Beach Lodge"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Boulders Beach Lodge"],["url=http:\/\/www.bouldersbeach.co.za\/"],["email="],["address=4 Boulders Place"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+27 (0)21 786-1758"],["tollfree="],["fax=+27 (0)21 786-1825"],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=Few meters from the beach entrance and offers rooms and self-catering accommodation.
