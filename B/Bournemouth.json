Bournemouth is known for its popularity with pensioners and has many residential care homes due to its constant and warm weather (by English terms). However, it is still possible to find vibrant nightlife and youthful activties like watersports.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Bournemouth.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["320px"],["Bournemouth's main Pier"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nBournemouth’s spa magic has been revitalised and history is repeating itself. A century ago the cream of Victorian society including royalty flocked to Bournemouth’s pine forest landscape of luxurious villas.  \t\n\nThey were eager to sample the relaxing ambience of the town, breathe its healthy air, bath in the pure sea water and unwind at leisure. In Tess of the D’Urbervilles Thomas Hardy affectionately described Bournemouth as ‘a Mediterranean lounging place on the English Channel’. The aroma and perfume of the pine trees were considered health-giving and many a famous person came here to take advantage of it including J.R.R. Tolkien and D.H. Lawrence. \t\n\nThe first spa hotel was built in 1885 - the Mont Dore Hotel (now Bournemouth’s Town Hall) Apart from luxury rooms and tennis courts, the hotel also offered the Mont Dore cure which was said to be a healing water and could not be found anywhere else in England. Sea and pure water from the Bourne stream were pumped into the basement of the hotel to allow the additional luxury of soaking and perspiring in Turkish and salt baths.\n\nSince then, Bournemouth has grown into a thriving seaside resort and many of the big hotels offer spa treatments of their own as well as spa and beauty boutiques peppered throughout the town centre catering for men as well as women. \t\n\nThe pine trees still exist and visitors can still stroll through ‘Pine Walk’ in Bournemouth Gardens today to breath in the healthy air. During the summer, the Pine Walk Open Air Art Exhibition is held here.\n\nIn recent years, Bournemouth's growing population of students, gays and surfers have given it a more bohemian image than a typical south coast retirement town, leading to the nickname \"BoMo\".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nUnless travelling from the South-West of England most journeys by road will be via the M27 which turns into the dual-carriageway A31 and passes through the New Forest. At Ringwood look for the (A338) Bournemouth exit.\nCare is necessary when entering into Bournemouth on the Wessex Way as there are numerous speed cameras.\n\nOnly those with a penchant for long queues of congestion should think about arriving at mid-day\/early afternoon on a warm and sunny day!

Bus services are generally good (particularly in the East-West direction), but there is a wrinkle: the town is served by two companies who do not accept each other's tickets.\nThey are the \"yellow\" Bournemouth buses, whose service extends to Christchurch and the east; and the \"blue\" Wilts and Dorset buses, whose routes extend more to Poole and the west. The main termini are at the rail station and the Square.\n\nTaxi services in Bournemouth are cheap for short journeys, with an initial charge of approximately £2. It is best to call for a cab rather than to queue at a rank near Holdenhurst for the best fare.\n\nThe station is a hike (10 or 15 minutes, uphill) from the centre, so consider transport.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Orientation"]},"\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Square"]}," is the name given to the open space where the Tourist Information office is, the main gardens are, the pier can be accessed, and the river Bourne empties (although it is not in fact particularly square).

Old Christchurch Road (note the 'Old') marks the upper limit of the main shopping area. Holdenhurst Road, leading from Old Christchurch Road to the station, is a student area of late-night takeaways. Christchurch Road (without the \"Old\") is a very long road leading out of the town centre to the town of the same name several miles to the west, with the Boscombe and Pokesdown strung along it.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["West Cliff"]}," is the clifftop, seafront area overlooking the Square, where there is collection of upmarket hotels and the International Centre.\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Triangle"]},", Bournemouth's gay village and specialist shopping area, is up Commercial Road from the Square.\n\nFurther west is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Westbourne"]},", a very twee and cute area of boutiques and cafes, mostly along Seamoor Road, and its associated arcade.
