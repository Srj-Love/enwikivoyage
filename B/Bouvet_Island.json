No claim was made until 1825 when the British flag was raised. In 1928, the UK waived its claim in favor of Norway, which had occupied the island the previous year. In 1971, Bouvet Island and the adjacent territorial waters were designated a nature reserve. Since 1977, Norway has run an automated meteorological station on the island. \n\nIt's not too hard to get a lot of search-engine-hits for airports, hotels, rental cars, or even airport limousines at Bouvet Island, even though there have never been, and likely never will be, such things.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\nIt is a small (58.5 kmÂ²) volcanic island that rises sharply from the ocean, with cliffs up to 500 metres high. Almost all of the island is covered by a thick glacier.  The highest point is Olav Peak at 780 meters.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]}," \n\nSince the entire island is a nature reserve, it's likely that you will be denied permission, if the purpose of entering is just tourism, although usually you won't find anybody of the Norwegian immigration office in the island to refuse your entry.  But if you absolutely have to get there anyway, your best bet is to try to find out when the next research expedition is scheduled to get there, and ask if you can join them. If you have a useful occupation or skill, such as arctic research biologist, research geologist, helicopter pilot, or physician, you will probably be welcome. There's been at least one case of this happening in the past, when a bunch of radio amateurs were allowed to enter the Island for a DXpedition (setting up an amateur radio station there to communicate with people across the world).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]}," \nThere is nothing even remotely usable as harbor, although it is possible to anchor outside of it. If you are willing to put your life at risk, you might try using a light boat with outboard engine to enter.
