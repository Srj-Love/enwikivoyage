Gang violence has risen in the past few years and drug crime remains.\n\nAvoid traveling into neighborhoods near Old 301, Palmetto, and Central Bradenton; these areas tend to have a higher concentration of crime, especially at night. Stick to the wealthier West Bradenton and Lakewood Ranch.\n\nAs always, don't walk around by yourself late at night or carry around expensive objects or large amounts of cash. Driving is normally pretty safe, however carjackings have been known to happen. If driving around at night, lock your car doors and windows. Again it is recommended to stick to major roads to avoid getting lost and ending up in a bad neighborhood.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sarasota"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saint Petersburg (Florida)"],["Saint Petersburg"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Palmetto (Florida)"],["Palmetto"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=I-75.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["directionl1=N"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tampa"]]}],["minorl1="],["directionr1=S"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Miami"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sarasota"]]}],["image2=I-275.svg"],["imagesize2=22"],["directionl2=N"],["majorl2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saint Petersburg (Florida)"],["Saint Petersburg"]]}],["minorl2="],["directionr2=S"],["majorr2=Ends at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:I-75.svg"],["18px"]]}],["minorr2="],["image3=US 19.svg"],["imagesize3=22"],["directionl3=N"],["majorl3=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tallahassee"]]}],["minorl3=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saint Petersburg (Florida)"],["Saint Petersburg"]]}],["directionr3=S"],["majorr3=Ends at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:US 41.svg"],["18px"]]}],["minorr3="],["image4=US 41.svg"],["imagesize4=22"],["directionl4=N"],["majorl4=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tampa"]]}],["minorl4=Apollo Beach"],["directionr4=S"],["majorr4=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Miami"]]}],["minorr4=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sarasota"]]}],["image5=Florida 64.svg"],["imagesize5=22"],["directionl5=W"],["majorl5=END"],["minorl5=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Anna Maria Island"]]}],["directionr5=E"],["majorr5=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Avon Park"]]}],["minorr5=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zolfo Springs"]]}],["image6=Florida 70.svg"],["imagesize6=22"],["directionl6=W"],["majorl6=END"],["minorl6="],["directionr6=E"],["majorr6=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fort Pierce"]]}],["minorr6=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Arcadia (Florida)"],["Arcadia"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["27.4833"],["-82.5833"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Southwest Florida"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Bradenton, Florida"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North America\/United States\/Florida\/Localities\/B\/Bradenton\/"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Bradenton, Florida"]]}]
