Originally founded by the Saxons, the name is a corruption of \"Broad Ford\", reflecting the watercourse which ran through the fledgling town.\n\nThe city expanded rapidly in the 19th century, based on the wool industry and was the wool capital of the world.  The population grew from 16,000 to 100,000 in the first half of the 19th century and continued to expand.  The legacy of Bradford's economic past remains today, it having over 5,800 listed buildings, with large mill complexes such as Lister's Mill (Manningham Mills) dotting the landscape and fine Neo-Gothic Architecture in the City Centre reflecting the city's importance.\n\nThe city has a diverse range of cultures, as many immigrants from County Mayo and Sligo in Ireland and Jewish wool merchants from Germany came to the city in the 19th century. People from Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania and Latvia came to the city during the second world war and afterwards many South Asian immigrants came to the city in the 1950s and 1960s, mainly from the Mirpur area of Kashmir, but some from other parts of Pakistan, India and Bangladesh.\n\nThe traditional industries of Bradford declined during the 1970s and 1980s, so Bradford is now in the process of re-inventing itself.  Bradford is UNESCO's first city of film and the city has a UNESCO World Heritage site at Saltaire. However, Bradford still faces similar problems to other post-industrial towns in northern England, including economic deprivation and social unrest.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.lbia.co.uk\/ Leeds-Bradford International Airport"]}]}," - the 737 and the 747 buses run frequently to the airport."]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By road "]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The M62 motorway crosses the Pennine belt and Bradford's own motorway the M606 is a spur off it at junction 26."]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By bus "]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Local Buses"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" There is a fast bus service from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Leeds"]]},", the X6 which is every 20 minutes Monday to Saturday during the day.
