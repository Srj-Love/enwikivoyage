While in Bom Jesus, you can ride the Bom Jesus funicular, the oldest funicular in the world moved by water balancing.

If you are looking for fun on weekdays your best chance is on Wednesdays, since it is \"academic night\" and most students go on having a drink and end the night in one of the local clubs. There are lots of small bars around the historic city centre. Most of them are well hidden on the tight streets, and you will only find them with the help of locals. It is not advised to walk around the city centre at night by yourself. It may look safe and very crowded during the day, but it's quite abandoned and very very dark during the night as most people prefer to go into the bars and coffee shops.\n\nList of Festivities in Braga:\n\n- Semana Santa (Holy week): In the week before Easter, there are lot's of events to commemorate the resurrection of Jesus Christ, such as processions.
