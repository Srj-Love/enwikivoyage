The cathedral has six columns representing two hands reaching up to almighty heaven.\n\nThe city is designed in the shape of a giant bird or airplane, with various separated zones assigned for specific functions such as housing, commerce, hospitals and banking. Running down the center of the \"airplane's\" fuselage is the thoroughfare called the ",{"type":"''","value":["Eixo Monumental"]}," (\"Monumental Axis\") and at one end lay the government buildings. The arched \"wings\" are residential zones, with several rows of medium-rise apartment blocks with small commercial districts. The intersection is the commercial and cultural hub, with stores, hotels, and the cathedral. A huge artificial lake serves the city as both a leisure area and to diminish the effects of low humidity in drier months (see ",{"type":"''","value":["Climate"]}," below).\n\nFifty-three years after its creation (1960), Brasilia is still developing a culture of its own. The city has often been criticized as a failed utopia where rationalized modernist planning has buried the human element.

In dry season (August–September) the city's landscape, normally very green, becomes desert-like and everyone must  drink lots of water to prevent the unpleasant effects of dehydration.

As in other Brazilian towns, there usually are some \"watchers\", people that offers to watch your car (supposedly to protect it from robbers), expecting to get some money in return; they usually behave like beggars, although they can turn violent towards the cars if not paid, scratching or chipping the paint job, so it would avoid some trouble to just give a little money, something around 2 reais.
