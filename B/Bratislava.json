The old town is centered on two squares, Hlavne namestie (main square) and Hviezdoslavovo namestie (Hviezdoslav square, named after a famous Slovak poet).

The city was even the capital (1536-1784), the coronation city (1563-1830), and the seat of the diet (1536-1848) of the Kingdom of Hungary for three centuries. In this period, eleven Hungarian kings and queens were crowned at St. Martin's Cathedral. At that time, the city was called Preßburg in German and Pozsony in Hungarian, and had a clear German (42%) and Hungarian (40%) ethnic majority (1910 census). In 1919, the Treaty of Trianon created Czechoslovakia, and Bratislava was attached to the newly founded state. In the same year, the name Bratislava was officially adopted for the first time in history.\n\nBetween 1939 and 1944, Slovakia was a Nazi Germany-controlled state. In 1941–1942 and 1944–1945, the pro-Nazi Slovak government cooperated in deporting most of Bratislava's approximately 15,000 Jews. Bratislava was occupied by German troops in 1944, and eventually taken by the Soviet Red Army on 4 April 1945, after a failed insurrection of Slovak partisans, now commemorated as ",{"type":"''","value":["Slovenského národného povstania"]},", or \"Slovak National Uprising\".\n\nAfter the Communist Party seized power in Czechoslovakia in February 1948, the city witnessed profound demographic and urban transformation, and in 1969 it became the capital city of the Slovak Socialist Republic, one of the two component state of federal Czechoslovakia.\n\nBratislava's dissidents anticipated the fall of Communism with the Bratislava candle demonstration in 1988, and the city became one of the foremost centres of the anti-Communist \"Velvet Revolution\" in 1989.

Once you reach the bridge, you will notice that there is a walkway running along the underside of it, for pedestrians. Once on the other side of the Danube river, follow the right hand-side of the bridge with a walkway made of red paving. This will lead you to the station.

Once exiting Aupark on the other side, turn right and follow the street to get to the pavement mentioned above.
