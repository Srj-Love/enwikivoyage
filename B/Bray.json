The house was designed by Richard Castle in 1741, for Viscount Powerscourt, in the style of an imposing Palazzo. The landscaping was remodelled a century later in the fashionable Italian manner. The design is believed to be based on Villa Butera in Sicily. The Japanese garden is an Edwardian addition; look out also for the pet cemetery. The waterfall in the Powerscourt estate is the highest in Ireland at 121 m and there are lots of woodland walks.\n\nGlendalough is located within Wicklow Mountains National Park. There are a number of early Christian monastic buildings, including several churches and a round tower. The area around the twin lakes is of outstanding natural beauty.\n\nGlencree German war cemetery: approximately 10 km from Enniskerry village, not easy to get to by public transport. There are 134 graves, mostly air force and navy personnel from World War II, very moving and a beautiful setting. Dr Hermann Görtz, a German spy, is also buried there. The single free-standing stone cross in the rear right hand corner of the cemetery was carved by him during his internment. Glencree Reconciliation Centre is across the road.\n\nThe Wicklow Way: explore all or part of Ireland's longest self-guided walking trail, at 127 km long. Expect the complete route to take 5–6 days. The Wicklow Way combines easy accessibility with a wide variety of scenic experiences, some of them in truly remote upland areas.
