This will take you to all important sites in Brasov and through an important part of the old town. It takes about 5-7 hours. There is also a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brasov cultural itinerary(short)"],["shorter version"]]}," for those in a hurry. The first part of this article is a short introduction which will give you an understanding of Brasov in the context of Transylvania and different cultural developments. The sites will be later related to these cultural developments. The itinerary will take into consideration all major ethnic groups that left their mark on Brasov, but there will be a bias towards Romanians, due to the fact that at present times they play the most important role in Brasov.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Roots "]},"\n\n\nEastern Romania and a part of Ukraine have been home to the first urban civilization in Europe: the Cucuteni or Trypillion Culture was contemporary with the Sumerian one and almost just as developed (3.000 - 4.000 B.C.). In spite of this fact, the epic of Romanian history is considered to start with the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Dacian culture"]}," (about 500 B.C.). This was a conglomerate of tribes that stretched all over what today is Romania  and even beyond. The Dacians have been conquered by the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Roman empire"]}," around the year 100 A.D. so that Romanians come out of the mix between Dacians ans Romans.\n\nBrasov existed at the time of Roman rule (which lasted till the 3rd century A.d.) in the form of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cumidava"]},".\n\n\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Medieval "]},"\nUntil the 11th century there is a total lack of documents about what has been going on in the territory of Romania. However in the 12th century Romania was fractured. The historic regions of Moldova and Tara Romaneasca have been consolidated in the 15th century. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Transylvania has been conquered by Hungary in the 12th century"]},". In the 12th century the Hungarian king settled Transylvania with Germans which are known as Saxons. This way the 12th century is the beginning of ",{"type":"'''","value":["the saga of the cohabitation of Romanians, Hungarians and Saxons in Transylvania"]},". Romanians were a majority but they had no rights during Hungarian rule, while the Saxons have been a privileged minority. In 1600 the three Romanian provinces (Moldova, Tara Romaneasca, Transylvania) have been united by Mihai Viteazul for one year until he has been assassinated. To the end of the 17th century Hungary along with Transylvania became part of the Austrian Hungarian empire.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Brasov has been attested in the year 1211"]}," as having fortifications designed by the Teutonic knights. These have been challenged repeatedly  by the Tatars and by the Turks, because ",{"type":"'''","value":["Brasov was a border city"]},". During this time several fortifications have been destroyed. In 1477 the construction of the Black Curch is finished. In 1688 the Romanian majority is protesting against the oppression but it is not successful. One year later a huge fire burns most of the city and it takes about 100 years to rebuild it.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Modern "]},"\nRomanian modern culture starts around the 16th century with the first preserved writings. The Romanians in Transylvania have been an important part of ",{"type":"'''","value":["the creation of unity and fight for a national ideal"]},". In this time intense cultural activities have been going on in Hungarian and Saxon ruling minorities as well. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Art, literature and science have developed fast"]},", almost to be up to date with western Europe. The 19th century has been a century of intense struggle for the Romanian national ideal and the reunification of the three provinces. In 1848 revolutions have happened in all provinces, but they have not been successful, so that the fight has been moved into an intellectual realm in Transylvania. After a war of independence ",{"type":"'''","value":["Tara Romaneasca and Moldavia united to become the kingdom of Romania"]},". The second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th have been a time of rapid cultural and technological developments, as well as urbanization, especially in the kingdom of Romania.\n\n1918 has been the year when ",{"type":"'''","value":["Transylvania was united with the kingdom of Romania, and became Greater Romania"]},". The time between the two world wars is considered to be Romania's greatest time, as it was a flourishing country, and ",{"type":"'''","value":["a key player in Europe"]},". After the second world war the communist regime landed like a dust bomb in Romania to turn everything gray: neighborhoods of historical houses have been destroyed, small business owners (which were mostly Hungarian, Jewish and Saxon) and intellectuals have been imprisoned and killed. Propaganda and oppression of everybody who was against the ",{"type":"'''","value":["insane regime"]}," became the norm. \n\nIn the 16th century ",{"type":"'''","value":["Brasov became an important city for printing"]},": it had two printing presses and the world's first paper mill. Cultural activities of all ethnic groups flourished, and the introduction of street lights in 1804 became a symbol for the cultural illumination of the city. In the second half of the 19th century Brasov becomes home of Transylvanias first credit institution, and it also got a telegraph, a train, a tram, and a telephone line. In 1916 Aurel Vlaicu is flying with his plane from Brasov. In 1987 a precursor of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Romanian Anticommunist revolution"]}," takes place in Brasov. On 2nd may 1989 the painter Liviu Babes sets himself on fire on a slope in Poiana Brasov to attract international attention over atrocities committed by the communist regime. Six months later the communist regime became history.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe itinerary starts from ",{"type":"'''","value":["Piata Unirii, or Union Square"]},". The square is called this way to celebrate the union of all Romanian provinces and the birth of modern Romania. You can get here from Livada Postei with line 50 or cut 50, and from the train station, Onix or Mesota with the line 51.\n\nPiata Unirii is located in the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Schei district"]},", which used to be the Romanian district: Romanians were not allowed to enter the city of Brasov except during the day.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" St. Nicholas Church and First Romanian School "]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["The St. Nicholas Church is visible from the square.

You can observe the one of the walls of the stadium is actually the old city wall. The stadium has been renovated with the help of the famous Romanian tennis player and manager Ion Tiriac.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Weavers Bastion "]},"\n\nRight next to the stadium is a tennis court, and behind it the Weavers Bastion. Brasov had 8 bastions, 3 of which are still in use today (another 3 are ruins). It also had 4 towers: fortification was very important for Brasov and the locals invested a lot into their safety. Every Bastion was maintained by a guild. The Weavers bastion has been initially built in the 15th century, and two more floors have been added in the 16th century.

During the summer there are many events and festivals. The museum in the former town hall is a history museum: if you wish you can visit it now, but it is recommended you visit it only later, if you like.
