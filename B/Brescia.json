The city's collection of religious art is housed by several museums.  You can buy a yearlong, unlimited pass to the museums for 20 Euro, 15 for students.\nBrescia has a very old and well regarded university.  The medical school, due to its proximity to the large regional hospital, is particularly well regarded.

Try to find the Contrada Santa Chiara, a dark side street parallel to Via San Faustino, where just off Via Dei Musei (close to the Roman Ruins and Santa Giulia), you'll find several highly authentic and inexpensive osterias including Osteria al Bianchi.\nCafe culture is just as prominent here as elsewhere, and there are several great coffee and aperitivo spots.

Try some of the non-DOC labels, which avoid EU regulations in order to preserve centuries-old vineyard traditions.\nBrescia is also one of the most night-active city in the whole Italy, because of the industrial wealth.  Brescian youths (and Lombardians in general) are famous for partying the night way—every single night.
