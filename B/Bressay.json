They arrive at Bressay next to the Bressay Heritage Centre. They usually run until midnight or so, but check in advance. In low-season, there are fewer crossings and they don't run as late. It's a 7 minute journey and it costs ₤5 per person and an extra ₤12.50 for a vehicle, return.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nMost of the inhabitants of Bressay live on the western side of the island, and the eastern parts are clearly less developed. Roads are rough and the east side of Bressay is therefore best explored on foot or -if you enjoy off track mountain biking- by bike. With no need to walk long distances you'll have plenty of opportunities to see some of the excellent bird life around and enjoy peaceful yet stunning vistas.\n\nOn the west side however, there are several good, single-track roads, making large parts of the island well accessible by car.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nMost people come here to enjoy the lovely landscapes and great wildlife. In summer, a ferry can take you to the nearby seabird haven of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Noss"]},", a tiny island and National Nature Reserve. It's a trip well worth taking, as the sight of thousands of seabirds nesting in the cliffs of Noss is one you'll remember.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Northern Lights Holistic Spa"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.shetlandspa.com\/Homepage"],["email="],["address=Sound View, UpHouse"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone =+44   1595 820 257"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=If the tranquil landscapes of Bressay aren't enough to get you all relaxed, the local spa surely will.
