However, in North Titusville on Garden street, there is a rather infamous seafood restaurant called Dixie Crossroads. It features specialty lobster, crab and most importantly, shrimp. Dixie Crossroads is famous for shrimp – Reds, Whites, Pinks, Brownies, “Hoppers” and, of course, our trademark specialty…Rock Shrimp, the sweetest little delicacy to ever come from the ocean. Their fresh shrimp comes from a fleet of over 25 full time commercial shrimpers. The shrimp are stored then cleaned by hand at our local processing plant, Cape Canaveral Shrimp Company. As various species are seasonal, Dixie Crossroads serves different shrimp throughout the year, depending on what is available at the time. It is quite a challenge to estimate how much of a particular type of shrimp must be put away in order to last until the next one comes in season. In a typical year, Dixie Crossroads will serve up to 7 or more different kinds of domestic shrimp. The restaurant was also visited by President Obama during is 2008 campaign.  \n\nAnother excellent restaurant of choice, located in historic downtown Cocoa, is the Black Tulip. It offers 4 star Italian dining, in wonderful ambiance and lighting. The food is always prepared fresh and the waiting staff is always quick and friendly. It is a bit pricey, but well worth the wait and visit.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Don't feed the animals!"]}," Brevard has some fascinating wild animals, including manatees, dolphins and alligators. All three are protected species, and all interaction (including touching or feeding them) is prohibited. \"Friendly\" dolphins and manatees seem safe, but they are powerful and unpredictable and may attack humans in the water. Additionally, feeding them interferes with their normal biological drives and reduces the natural fear which keeps them safe from dangerous people. Throwing leftover scraps to a wild gator seems fun - but a gator approaching you for scraps looks just like a hungry gator approaching to eat you! Such gators are inevitably destroyed as nuisance animals, so feeding them is no favor. Other endangered animals such as sea turtles also need your protection - large nests of sea turtle eggs on the beaches are usually marked by wildlife officials and must never be disturbed.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Sunburn"]}," can occur even on cloudy days.
