In the early 18th century, Bridge of Allan comprised not much more than a mill and a collection of poor cottages near the bridge. In 1745, 300 Highlanders from Bonnie Prince Charlie's army blockaded the bridge and collected tolls. In August 1787 Robert Burns visited Stirling and passed through Bridge of Allan on his way to the Roman Fort at Braco and then on to Crieff. In 1793 he wrote his poem 'By Allan Stream' \n\nIn the late 18th.Century the area was famous for copper mining but when this declined, Bridge of Allan became a popular Victorian resort and Spa. This was particularly so after the arrival of the railway in 1848. Many grand houses were built at this time, Kilronan House built in 1853 is typical",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.kilronan.co.uk"]},". Today you can still dine in the old spa pump room which is now a restaurant. In the high street there are numerous artisan shops and a varied selection of restaurants and pubs.

For over twenty years Stevenson came here each summer to spend his holidays. There is a lovely walk along the river on the old drove road to Dunblane.
