The Gangster Disciples, Latin Kings, and drug dealers from New York all battled for control of the city's many housing projects, places like Father Panik Village, Pequonnock village, Marina Village and the PT Barnum Housing Projects. Today, for the tourist staying for a few days or weeks, Bridgeport's bark is bigger than its bite.  The main attractions for tourists like the Harboryard and the PT Barnum Museum are in areas that are not to be considered high crime. Traveling to the East Side or East End is considered to be the Spanish harlem of the city, as that is where all the Spanish restaurants and shops are located along with a strong catholic religious background indicative of the churches located within this area as well.\n\nNow, downtown is being rehabbed.  The plan is to have apartments in former destitute buildings.  Downtown will be the hustle and bustle it used to be, full of people and shopping happening on a daily basis. Downtown has limited parking so bring your quarters for the on street parking.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=Amtrak_Northeast_Regional.png"],["imagesize1=100"],["directionl1=SW"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["New York City"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Stamford (Connecticut)"],["Stamford"]]}],["directionr1=NE"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hartford"]]},"\/",{"type":"[[","value":[["Providence"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["New Haven"]]}]}],["image2=I-95.svg"],["imagesize2=22"],["directionl2=S"],["majorl2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["New York City"]]}],["minorl2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fairfield (Connecticut)"],["Fairfield"]]}],["directionr2=N"],["majorr2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Haven"]]}],["minorr2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Stratford (Connecticut)"],["Stratford"]]}],["image3=Connecticut Highway 8.svg"],["imagesize3=22"],["directionl3=N"],["majorl3=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Waterbury"]]}],["minorl3=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Trumbull"]]}],["directionr3=S"],["majorr3=END"],["minorr3="],["image4=US 1.svg"],["imagesize4=22"],["directionl4=S"],["majorl4=",{"type":"[[","value":[["New York City"]]}],["minorl4=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fairfield (Connecticut)"],["Fairfield"]]}],["directionr4=N"],["majorr4=",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Haven"]]}],["minorr4=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Stratford (Connecticut)"],["Stratford"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["41.186389"],["-73.195556"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Fairfield County"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Bridgeport, Connecticut"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North_America\/United_States\/Connecticut\/Localities\/B\/Bridgeport\/"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Bridgeport, Connecticut"]]}]
