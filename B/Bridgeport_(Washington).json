Some of the earliest settlers in the area were Chinese miners extracting gold from the banks of the Columbia River. Developers purchased the town in 1892 and renamed it Bridgeport after where they had come from, Bridgeport, Connecticut. The city of Bridgeport was officially incorporated on March 21, 1910. The biggest economic boom to come to the city came in the form of the building of the massive Chief Joseph Dam just upstream from the city limits.\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:CHIEF JOSEPH DAM - NARA - 548008.jpg"],["250px"],["thumbnail"],["Chief Joseph Dam"]]},"\nChief Joseph Dam\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=WA-17.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["directionl1=N"],["majorl1=Ends at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:US 97.svg"],["18px"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brewster (Washington)"],["Brewster"]]}],["directionr1=S"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moses Lake"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Coulee City"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Columbia River Plateau"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Bridgeport, Washington"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["48.006111111111"],["-119.67166666667"]]}]
