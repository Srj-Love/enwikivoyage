Locals also use John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport in New York City, as well as Philadelphia International Airport in Philadelphia.  From the Airport, take the TransBridgeLines bus to Branchburg, NJ (this is a park and ride stop so arrange for a cab pickup or a friend to meet you here ahead of time, the Branchburg stop has no facilities).  The Branchburg stop is around 3 miles from central Bridgewater.  Another option is to take the NJ Transit Train, which will require a connection at Newark Penn Station (see below).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Bridgewater Station March 2014.jpg"],["thumb"],["Bridgewater Station"]]},"\nBridgewater is served by the Bound Brook, Bridgewater, Somerville, and Raritan stations on the Raritan Valley Line.  Because it is not electrified, the Raritan Valley Line terminates at Newark Penn Station, and a connection is required to go to New York City.  If you are coming from Newark Airport, take any train headed towards New York, get off at Newark Penn Station (the very next stop), and board the next Raritan Valley Line train towards \"Raritan\" or \"High Bridge.\"  The most connections are available locally at Somerville Station, which is also most convenient to most of the corporate parks and business locales within Bridgewater.  Cabs are usually available to meet trains at Somerville Station, and local busses run on weekdays to the Bridgewater Commons Mall.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nCommuter Bus Service is provided by TransBridgeLines to a park-and-ride facility in Branchburg, NJ on US 202.  This service usually takes just over one hour from NYC and sometimes stops at Newark Airport on the way.  Certain runs make a stop at the MetLife office building in Bridgewater, but most go straight to Branchburg, which is just 3 miles away.  Heading west, TransBridge provides service to\/from Flemington, Frenchtown, Lambertville, and Bethlehem, Pa.  This is by far the fastest transit option from NYC or Newark Airport to the Bridgewater area.  However, as noted above, the Branchburg bus stop is a highway park-and-ride facility with no indoor waiting area - make previous arrangements for a ride or a cab.  NJ Transit runs Bus 114 from New York City, however this is a local service and takes over two hours - use this if you are headed to other NJ towns, such as Plainfield.  Susquehanna Trailways runs busses twice daily to\/from Williamsport, PA (going to New York).  This bus stops in downtown Somerville NJ.  WHEELS 884 is a local service that provides service to\/from Clinton, NJ which is approx. 15 miles away. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nDespite proposed transit improvements for Central Jersey, private car remains by far the easiest way to get to Bridgewater.  Interstate 287 (exit 17 if you are approaching ON 287 south, exit 14B if you are approaching ON 287 north) provide access to the town.  US 22, US 202\/206, and NJ 28 all converge at the Somerville Circle, a major (and notoriously dangerous) intersection in Central Jersey.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nBridgewater is a relatively car dependent town.  If you find yourself car-less in the 'burbs, NJ Transit can get you around to a certain extend.  Rail service on the Raritan Valley line has stations at Bound Brook, Bridgewater, Somerville, and Raritan.  The Bridgewater station is located in the far eastern end of the town, and Somerville station is probably more convenient for most purposes.  If you are looking to get a cab, they are usually available to meet trains at Somerville Station.  If you are elsewhere and need to call for a cab, SkyView Cab serves the area, call (908) 725-2233. Local busses do exist to take you between Somerville, and the Bridgewater mall, but do not traverse much else of the town.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:VAN HORNE HOUSE, SOMERSET COUNTY, NJ.jpg"],["thumb"],["Van Horne House, at 941 E.
