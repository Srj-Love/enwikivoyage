It has a population of about 2 million people, making it the third-largest city in Australia, after ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sydney"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Melbourne"]]},".\n\nIt’s a positive attitude and creative confidence that makes Brisbane a genuine new-world city. Large enough to be cosmopolitan yet small enough to be friendly and accessible, this 'garden metropolis' is famous for its leafy, open spaces and the pleasant pace of life that unfolds between the zig-zags of its iconic river. Even though Brisbane is rapidly developing and forward-thinking, it maintains a youthful enthusiasm and has what is arguably the most laid back and liveable atmosphere of any east-coast capital city.\n\nGaining international exposure during the 1982 Commonwealth Games, the 1988 World Expo and the 2001 Goodwill Games, Brisbane's year-round warm climate, spectacular scenery and pleasant locals have been the draw-cards for many domestic and international visitors, making Brisbane the fastest-growing city in Australia.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nFor many thousands of years prior to European settlement, the Yagara Aboriginal people lived on the floodplain where the greater Brisbane region is situated. The Australian English phrase \"hard yakka\" - meaning \"hard work\" - comes from these people, and is certainly what the European settlers faced in Brisbane's humid sub-tropical climate.\n\nIn 1823, John Oxley was the first English colonist to explore Brisbane, which was then selected by the colony of New South Wales as the location for a new jail, intended to house dangerous prisoners in a remote location. The settlement was named \"Brisbane\" after Sir Thomas Brisbane, the Governor of New South Wales at that time. This original settlement was established in what is now the suburb of Redcliffe but was later moved to a location further down the bay.\n\nA series of major immigration events took place in the following decades which brought with it strong industry and commercial development in the region. In 1837, free settlers moved to the area and pushed to close the jail and to release the land in the area, and in 1859 a gold rush led to the establishment of the colony of Queensland with Brisbane as its capital. Ipswich, a coal-mining centre immediately to the west of Brisbane was initially proposed as the capital city, but was ruled out for being too far upstream with no shipping access.\n\nIn 1925, the Queensland State Parliament created the City of Brisbane Act that set up a single government for the city of Brisbane, still the largest metropolitan authority in Australia, and one of the largest in the world by area.\n\nSubsequent years to the present has seen strong immigration into Brisbane and the surrounding region, both domestically and internationally, with large communities from Asia, United Kingdom and New Zealand. This was driven by cheaper house prices than other Australian cities, a pleasant climate and good employment opportunities, especially within the mining and tourism sectors.\n\nRecent years have seen Brisbane go from drought to flooding rains. In the mid-2000s, lower dam levels led to severe water restrictions for residents. The campaign to lower water usage was so successful that the city can boast one of the lowest average water use per resident of any developed city in the world. From 2010-onwards, a number of extremely wet summers has refilled local water supplies and you're not likely to find the tap dry or see any visible signs of the shortage. However, it is still expected you keep your showers relatively brief and expect the locals to be horrified if you walk away from a running tap.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Brisbane River viewed from William Jolly Bridge.jpg"],["thumb"],["400px"],["River view from William Jolly Bridge."]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nBrisbane has a climate that is enjoyable year-round.

A paper ticket is valid for travel only in the zones you ask for and is only valid for one way trips, so make sure you buy a ticket that covers all the zones you'll need to travel in. Paper tickets are being phased out in favour of the competitively cheaper Go Card (see below).\n\nTravellers should ensure they have a valid ticket as ticket inspectors make frequent appearances and fines can be significant.

Buses and CityCats\/Ferries are fitted with go card machines that are apparent when you board, whilst train stations have external panels located on the platform or nearby. A deposit of $5 applies when purchasing a go card. Go cards can be purchased and topped up from staff at train stations, some ticket vending machines and selected newsagents and convenience stores, which there are many of in the city centre.\n\nBuying a go card removes the hassle of figuring out zones.

Translink uses the word \"journey\" to mean end-to-end journey including any required transfers, and the word \"trip\" to mean a single point-to-point trip.  A journey can be made up of one or more trips.  When making a number of trips to get to your destination it is still one journey if you touch on within 60 minutes of touching off on your previous trip.\n\nGetting a go-card will save you around 50c to $1 on the average journey.  However, getting a refund for the unused money and $5 deposit can be a hassle.  If you have paid by credit card you need apply and have the money returned by cheque or by transfer to an Australian bank account.  If you have paid by cash you can get a refund at a train station, including the airport train station.\n\nIf you are going to be doing extensive travel or using the Airtrain, you can buy a 3-day or 5-day unlimited travel go-card for $79 and $129 respectively.  You don't have to worry about topping up and refunds, but you you'll struggle to get value out of it unless you are catching the airtrain.

You must observe the time restrictions for transfers to avoid having to pay for another journey.\n\nOften, major stops like shopping centres and busway stops are used as zone boundaries. Stops that form part of the zone boundary are considered part of both zones, so you may travel to them on a valid ticket that covers either zone.\n\nIf buying a paper ticket, say which zones you wish for it to be valid for, although all operators generally know what to give you if you tell them your destination. Ensuring your ticket is valid for your current journey is important as bus drivers may make you pay for another ticket or not allow you on at all, and officers on trains and ferries may fine you.\n\nIf you are using a Go Card, then fares are calculated automatically.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["CityFerry and CityCat"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Brisbane CityCats.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Two of Brisbane's CityCats"]]},"\n\nCityFerries and CityCats have become an icon of the city and are fantastic ways to tour Brisbane along the river. The CityCats are high-speed catamarans with stops at South Bank and the city centre as well as many riverside suburbs, and are a very popular method of getting around for tourists. CityFerries are more traditional ferries which generally operate shorter routes with more frequent stops; you may end up on one if you must use one of the smaller terminals, but in practice, most riverside destinations are accessible from the faster and more modern CityCats.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Trains"]},"\nTrains in greater Brisbane run along radial lines. Most train services in Brisbane are through-running, travelling from one end of the suburbs to the other, however all trains service Roma Street, Central, Fortitude Valley and Bowen Hills regardless of their ultimate destination. Interurban services can also be caught to the Gold Coast (using connecting bus services at Nerang and Robina) and Sunshine Coast (using connecting bus services at Landsborough and Nambour) as well as Australia Zoo (connecting bus at Beerwah). Trains generally run from 6AM to midnight, though there are some variations such as running later on Friday and Saturday nights, and finishing earlier on Sundays.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Buses"]},"\nBrisbane has a large network of bus routes. Virtually all buses have a digital display of their route number and destination(s). The inner city areas are very well serviced by buses, with the most popular routes running from 6AM to 11PM as a minimum, and most routes ultimately terminating at Queen St Bus Station, Fortitude Valley (via Adelaide St or Elizabeth St) or on the ",{"type":"'''","value":["busway"]},". In some of Brisbane's notoriously dispersed outer suburbs, services may be much less frequent or have reduced running hours, so it is advisable to check timetables if making these trips. Due to Brisbane traffic, buses are occasionally up to 10 minutes late during peak hour.\n\nBrisbane's dedicated busway runs from a corridor in the southern or northern suburbs, through South Bank and the central business district. Due to the large number of buses in the central business district, a number of other routes use stops scattered across the city streets, so if you are unfamiliar with the geography of Brisbane, use of the busway is recommended where possible. The busway and rail network meet at Roma Street station, and the two combined provide very good coverage of the key inner city areas.\n\nDrivers do carry notes with them, but not always many or of high value. If you must pay cash, try to pay the correct amount and with coins where possible. Note that some services, especially in peak hour, do not sell tickets on board at all and only accept pre-purchased tickets or go cards. These are signed with the letter ",{"type":"'''","value":["'P"]},"' before the route number. As with many cities, Brisbane has a large number of express buses, so it should not be assumed that all buses observe every stop along the roads they travel. In peak hour there are even more express routes (\"rockets\" and \"bullets\") for commuters which make very few stops at all. Ask the driver if you are unsure.\n\nBrisbane also has all-night bus services on Friday and Saturday nights on selected routes; this is branded 'NightLink'.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Noteworthy routes"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The 'Brisbane City Loop' ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/translink.com.au\/resources\/travel-information\/services-and-timetables\/timetables\/091207_loop_brisbanecity.pdf"]}," is a free and convenient bus service travelling in both directions around the CBD.

It is a prominent landmark approximately 6 km (4 mi) to the west of the Brisbane central business district and is visible from much of the city. Before the Moreton Bay penal settlement, Mount Coot-tha was the home of the Turrbal Aboriginal people. Early Brisbane people called it One Tree Hill when bush at the top of the mountain was cleared except for one large eucalypt tree. The Aboriginal people of the area used to come to the mountain to collect ‘ku-ta’ (honey) that was produced by the native stingless bee. Mount Coot-tha (Place of Honey), a derivative of (the indigenous term), replaced the former title ‘One Tree Hill' in 1880 when the area was declared a Public Recreation Reserve.
