This was done at least partly on the basis of a promise by the Federal Government to build a railway linking BC to the rest of Canada.  Significant geographical barriers and political feuding delayed the completion of this railway until 1885 when the last spike was driven home at a place called Craigellachie in the Eagle Pass area in the interior of BC.\n\nBeing on the Pacific, there has always been a strong Asian influence.  Many Chinese men arrived in the early part of the 19th Century to work in the gold rush of that era and later many more worked on the construction of the railway through the mountains.\n\nThe indigenous people of BC have been called Indians or Native Canadians, but now the generally accepted term is First Nations.  \n\nPrior to arrival of Europeans BC was a very prosperous area.  This was largely due the abundance of salmon.  This was demonstrated by the advanced culture that existed in BC.  More than thirty languages belonging to seven different language families were spoken in BC. Initially the arrival of Europeans was a positive relationship.  However, eventually the Europeans brought smallpox and other diseases, which decimated the First Nations population.  \n\nMany First Nations people were encouraged or even forcibly required to send their children to residential schools during the early to mid 20th century.  These schools were government sponsored.  The primary intent of the schools was to assimilate the First Nation population.  Children were taught that their culture was backward and evil and were not allowed to speak their native languages.  This was a systemic problem at that time and has only recently been addressed and discussed openly.\n\nMany of the First Nation communities have being trying to revive their culture and are now often the center of much of the ecotourism industry.  \n\nWith a few exceptions, the First Nations of BC (unlike the rest of Canada) have never signed treaties or officially ceded their territory to Canada.  Therefore the official ownership of much of the province is contested as the First Nations claim much of the province as their territory.  The courts have generally acknowledged that there is a basis for the claims based on historical use of the land and has urged the governments to negotiate a settlement to these claims.  Settling these land claims has been a complex issue that is still ongoing.  The first modern treaty signed was by the Nis'ga in Northern BC. In 2007, the Tsawassen and Maa-Nulth First Nations signed treaties with the Province and the federal government.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]}," \n\nAlthough Canada is officially a bilingual French\/English country, you would be hard pressed to find many French-speaking people in BC.

Between Mission and Ashcroft, BC, the eastbound VIA train runs on Canadian Pacific track due to a directional running agreement between Canadian Pacific and Canadian National. VIA Rail also offers passenger rail service between Jasper, AB, Prince George, BC and Prince Rupert, BC on the north coast with \"The Skeena\" that runs over Canadian National's former Grand Truck Pacific BC North line, \"The Skeena\" connects with BC Ferries' Inside Passage and Queen Charlotte routes at Prince Rupert.\n\nOn the former Pacific Eastern\/British Columbia Railway line, now owned by CN, an elite-class and expensive passenger tour service is operated by a private operator as the ",{"type":"''","value":["Rocky Mountaineer"]},", to Prince George and Jasper, returning to Vancouver via the another CN line via Kamloops.

It sometimes serves the community of D'Arcy at the far end of Anderson Lake if there is demand, but there is no scheduled service between D'Arcy and Lillooet, though the shuttle does run daily from Seton Portage to Lillooet and back.

Float planes can also be convenient for accessing many coastal locations.\n\nGetting around here is not always easy. Many worthwhile destinations are outside of the cities and not accessible by public transportation options. This makes renting a car quite a popular option for getting around, although there is some bus service to be found.  Bear in mind when travelling by car that headlights should be used both day and night, regardless of conditions. If driving during the winter, plan your route carefully as British Columbia experiences some hazardous weather.\n\nIf you drive or rent a vehicle, be aware that provincial law requires fuel to be prepaid before filling up.  If you use a \"pay-at-pump\" interface, the station may place a hold on an available amount in your account which may last for a few days.

There is also daily bus services to Vancouver Island and Whistler.\n\nYou will also find that the ferry service (provided by BCFerries ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.bcferries.com"]},") is the only way to access many island and coastal communities.  Some of the smaller islands can be visited on foot or by bicycle, but in many cases additional road transportation is necessary. Although ferry service is generally reliable, taking an automobile on board is rarely cheap, and you will likely find it less expensive to take the ferry as a foot passenger and rent an automobile at your destination. If you are taking bus service across a ferry, you should confirm when buying your bus ticket that the ferry fare is included.\n\nAlong with \"The Canadian\" and \"The Skeena\" VIA Rail Canada operates \"The Malahat\", a daily regional passenger service between Victoria, the Captial City, and Courtenay, BC (139 railway miles north of Victoria) on the Southern Railway of Vancouver Island, the former Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway. \"The Malahat\" makes one round trip daily out of Victoria while \"The Canadian\" and \"The Skeena\" run three times per week.\n\nRocky Mountain Rail Tours ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.rockymountaineer.com\/"]}," operates tourist trains from Vancouver to Whistler, Vancouver to Kamloops, Kamloops to Banff or Calgary, Kamloops to Jasper, and Whistler to Jasper during the tourist season (May-October).
