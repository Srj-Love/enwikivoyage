It was only in the 1960s that Dr Joyce Lambert proved that they were artificial features, the effect of flooding on early peat excavations.\n\nThe Romans first exploited the rich peat beds of the area for fuel, and in the Middle Ages the local monasteries began to excavate the peat lands as a business, selling fuel to Norwich and Great Yarmouth.  Then the sea levels began to rise, and the pits began to flood. Despite the construction of windpumps and dykes, the flooding continued and resulted in the typical Broads landscape of today, with its reed beds, grazing marshes and wet woodland.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\nThe Broads largely follows the line of the rivers and natural navigations of the area. There are seven navigable rivers, the River Yare and its (direct and indirect) tributaries the Rivers Bure, Thurne, Ant, Waveney, Chet and Wensum. \n\nThe broads themselves range in size from small pools to the large expanses of Hickling Broad, Barton Broad and Breydon Water. The broads are unevenly distributed, with far more broads in the northern half of Broadland (the Rivers Bure, Thurne and Ant) than in the central and southern portions (the Rivers Yare, Waveney, Chet and Wensum).\n\nSome of the larger broads form nationally important freshwater marshes.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Swallowtail Butterfly (Papilio machaon) - geograph.org.uk - 854088.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["300 px"],["The Swallowtail is found nowhere else in the UK"]]},"\n\nThe Broads are a very important remnant of the wetlands that once dominated much of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["East Anglia"]]},".
