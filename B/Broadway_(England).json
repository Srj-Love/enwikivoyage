Often referred to as the \"Jewel of the Cotswolds\" and the \"Show Village of England\" because of its archetypal rural beauty, the 'Broad Way' leads from the foot of the western Cotwolds escarpement along a wide grass-fringed street lined with ancient honey-coloured limestone buildings, many dating back to the 16th century.

As many as 40 travellers' inns once existed within the village to service those passing through, a few of which are still in use today.\n\nBroadway has been home to a large number of prominent English artists and composers, including Sir Edward Elgar, John Singer Sargent, J.M. Barrie, Vaughan Williams and Arts and Crafts artist and writer William Morris.\n\nLike many ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cotswolds"],["Cotswold"]]}," villages, Broadway became prosperous from the wool trade, and much of its charm comes from its large number of luxurious old limestone houses.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Broadway"]}," is a major tourist destination and private chartered coach trips are run by a vast number of companies from most major cities, including ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Birmingham (England)"],["Birmingham"]]},", plus other nearby tourist hotspots such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Stratford-upon-Avon"]]},".
