The Gorani have a total population of roughly 50,000 people. They are primarily sheep and cattle herders, but also have a cartel network of dessert\/sweet shops. They live in a very geographically small mountainous area of the most southern part of Kosovo, in and near the city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dragash"]]}," just south of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Prizren"]]},".\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Gorani"]}," have their own language and are historically Muslim, their language, which is a Torlakian Slavic language, is related to Serbian and Macedonian, with Albanian and Turkish loanwords.\n\nThe village of Brod has a population of perhaps 8,000 people. It lies in a high mountain valley\/ravine. It has a rough elevation of 1,200 meters, but the mountains above it reach 2,200 meters. As the people have been living and herding cattle there for hundreds and hundreds of years, the surrounding mountains are completely over grazed and deforrested (in a beautiful way). Due to this, in order for the people to have some means of heating in the winter, they pack the manure from their cattle and goats on the sides of their houses so that it will dry. Fortunately, most of the manure is dry, so the village doesn't smell.\n\nThe building materials for the houses are all taken from the immediate area, so everything is made out of mountain rocks. Several mountain springs run throught the village on their way down to the flat plains of Kosovo.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Brod is spectacular!"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nFrom ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Prizren"]]},", take a combi to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dragaš"]]},". From Dragaš, you will either have to take a taxi (for probably a lot of money) or start walking. The hike to Brod is about 8 km up a small road. Ask a local which way to go. If you hitch hike, the first or second car will probably pick you up, although cars only pass once every 30 minutes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nBy horse of course\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nIt is worth your while to just walk around the town and see what it is like.
