[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.brooklinema.gov\/ Brookline"]}]}," is a town in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Massachusetts"]]}," that is bordered on three sides by ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boston"]]},". Brookline is primarily residential, and it's technically a suburb, but it's fairly high density considering all of that. Brookline is in fact denser than many major cities, such as Los Angeles! In terms of the number of T stops, it's probably the best-connected of any town to Boston.\n\nBrookline has quite a few destinations, but unless you're meeting someone or have your heart set on a particular restaurant, Brookline probably doesn't justify a stop. It has some interesting attractions, shops, and restaurants, but they're primarily patronized by locals and aren't wildly interesting, especially compared to those in the rest of the Boston area.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nBrookline is very close to and therefore served by Boston's sole major airport, Logan International Airport.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nBrookline is served by 2 out of 4 branches of the MBTA light rail known as the Green Line, which is in itself a part of the system known as the T.\n\nTake the C line from Boston, and get off at one of the main stops in Brookline. Coolidge Corner is a great place to get off the train.\n\nThe D line, also accessible from many places downtown, will bring you to Brookline Village, a quaint area with many restaurants, though it isn't as big a draw for people who live outside the area. Brookline Village is a little sleepier and more residential, although it has some dining and shopping.\n\nThe B line doesn't actually enter Brookline proper, but its Commonwealth Ave. stops are all within blocks of Brookline.\n\nThe E line is a bit of a hike, but you can get to it by walking all the way to the Fens.\n\nThe D line is much faster with less stops than the B and C lines.  If given the choice between one or the other, take the D line. That said, the D line is further away from most of the people and businesses in Brookline, who mostly are near the C line, which also has the most stops of any Green Line branch in Brookline.\n\nIf you are disabled, think carefully before taking the train into Brookline.  Only a few Green Line stops are wheelchair-accessible (the MBTA ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.mbta.com"]}," website should have the most current accessibility information). During busier times of day wheelchair users should have little difficulty getting to Coolidge Corner, Washington Square, and Brookline Village on one of the newer Green Line trolleys with low floors; however many older-style cars with large steps up are still in use, especially during non-peak hours, and these are accessible only via hand-cranked wheelchair lift. The situation is better now than it was even just a few years ago, but the Green Line is still a long way from being universally accessible. The other rail lines in the MBTA, for the most part, have handicap access.\n\nAll MBTA rapid transit services, including the Green Line, are $2 with a plastic RFID (wireless transmitter) card known as the CharlieCard, and $2.50 with either a CharlieTicket or cash. Unfortunately for riders, the CharlieCard, for the most part is only available at neighborhood stores such as 7-11s. The vending machines, for some bizarre reason, only vend CharlieTickets, and it's impossible to pay in cash if you're taking the trip from downtown.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nCars and Brookline, like most of Boston and its immediate suburbs, do not mix perfectly.  One thing to be aware of is that there is generally no overnight parking on streets; those cars on streets after 2AM (11PM in some areas) will be ticketed...seriously! There is also a two-hour parking limit, which is not as strictly enforced. (But wouldn't you know it, your car will be the one that gets ticketed :)\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.brooklinema.gov\/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&id=121&Itemid=643 Parking"]}]}]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nThe following Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.mbta.com"]}," bus routes are in Brookline:\n\nRoute 66-At Coolidge Corner and Brookline Village.
