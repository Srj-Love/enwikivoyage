Using Google Maps transit directions is an easy way to get accurate directions throughout Brooklyn (as well as the rest of NYC). However, do check the MTA website ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.mta.info\/"]}," for service changes, as Google Maps tends to miss out on those. You can also use the subway map on MTA website or pick one up for free at a station agent's booth.\n\nBrooklyn is well served by some 18 ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New York City#By subway"],["subway"]]}," lines. The biggest hub is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Atlantic Avenue - Barclays Center"]},".

The downside is that the buses are much slower than the subway (though not as slow as in Manhattan) and figuring out their route may be confusing. It's highly suggested to have a bus map handy (available free from any subway station agent) or to use Google Maps route planner, which incorporates bus directions very accurately.\n\nAs in the rest of New York City, some buses are limited (LTD) service, which means they skip certain stops along the route. However, even non-limited buses won't stop if the \"Stop Request\" light isn't on and no one is waiting at the bus stop (this is very common). If you plan to get off, make sure you press the \"Stop Request\" tape\/button before you approach your stop, or else the bus may skip it.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By commuter rail"]},"\nThere is the option of taking the Long Island Rail Road if your starting and ending points are in the following neighborhoods: Downtown Brooklyn, near Atlantic Avenue\/Flatbush Avenue, Bedford-Stuyvesant, near Atlantic Avenue\/Nostrand Avenue, and East New York, near Atlantic Avenue\/Van Sinderen Avenue. It isn't terribly convenient, due to the limited stops and relatively infrequent service, but if you need to go to exactly the areas it stops in, it's faster than the subway.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"''","value":["See the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Districts"],["Districts"]]}," articles for more listings."]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landmarks"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Soldiers' and Sailors' Arch.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["The Soldiers' and Sailors' Arch in Grand Army Plaza"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brooklyn\/Downtown"],["Downtown"]]}," is where you'll find the one of the most famous of all New York landmarks: the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Brooklyn Bridge"]},", which connects the borough to Lower Manhattan.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Grand Army Plaza"]}," marks the gateway to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brooklyn\/Prospect Park"],["Prospect Park"]]},", and is home to the distinctive Soldiers and Sailors Arch.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brooklyn\/Coney Island and Brighton Beach"],["Coney Island"]]}," is a hotspot during the summer season.
