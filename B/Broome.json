The camping grounds are booked out pretty early and accommodation can be hard to find at the height of the season.\n\nThe town has an interesting history based around the exploits of the men and women who developed the pearling industry, starting with the harvesting of oysters for mother of pearl in the 1880s to the current major cultured pearl farming enterprises.  The riches from the pearl beds did not come cheap and the town's Japanese cemetery is the resting place of more than 900 Japanese divers who lost their lives working in the industry.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" From ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Perth (Western Australia)"],["Perth"]]},": By road approx 2,200 km.
