Objects found (such as the stone axe in Rasen), date back to the Bronze and Iron Ages and can be seen in Bruneck and places around it.\nRelicts of Roman times can be seen everywhere - such as the milestone in Sonnenburg directly on the main road, which marked the route the Legions took through the valley from Aquileja to Aguntum.\n\nThe Celtic-Illyrishen tribes were Christianised and taken over by Romans until the Bavarians took over the supremacy of the region (after savage battles with the Slaves) in the sixth century.\n\nA witness of this is the founding of the ”Stift Innichen“ by Duke Tassilo II in 769 AD.\n\nReflected in the names of the region are the Bavarian settlers - The county Pustrissa was given to a Count who made Sunapurc (Sonnenburg)  his home, which still exists and is now ",{"type":"[[","value":[["St._Lorenzen#Sleep"],["Castle Hotel Sonnenburg"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["St. Lorenzen"],["Sankt Lorenzen"]]},".\n\nIn 1091 Emperor Henry VI gave the region (later to the Bruneck) to the Bishop of Brixen, Altwin.\n\nIn order to safeguard his lands and property Bishop Bruno von Kirchberg and Bullenstein built the Castle and town of Bruneck in 1250. \nIn 1256 the settlement “apud Bruneke“ appears in the records. \nIn 1370 the town was given the freedom of “weekly markets“.\n\nFlourishing business and trade helped the town grow- At the beginning of the fifteenth century the first houses and workshops were built - mostly for the craftsmen. It was the birth of the picturesque ”Stadtgasse“. Floods in the 14th and 19th centuries, the plague (1543\/44), catastrophic fires and earthquakes struck the town, but Bruneck was rebuilt again and again.\n\nThe years between 1814-1914 can be called the “flourishing years“ - visitors started to discover the region and alpinism begin to establish itself. 1871 saw the opening of the Puster Valley Railway.\n\nWith the outbreak of the First World War this period came to an end, although the town was spared destruction during the war.\n\nThe Second World War took lives and left its mark behind.\n\nThe latest development shows a town which is economically and culturally the centre of the Puster valley. Industry and trade are amalgamated to the advantage of both residents and visitors.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThere are various ways of getting here to the heart of the alps - quickly and comfortably.\n\nSee more information on how to get to South Tyrol in general in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South_Tyrol#Get_in"],["that article"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\n\nThere are pooled shuttle services from Verona, Munich, Innsbruck and other Airports to Bruneck.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nBruneck is on the Franzenfeste-Innchen(-Lienz) strech (",{"type":"''","value":["Pustertal Line"]},").
