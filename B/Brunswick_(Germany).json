It is located north of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Harz"]]}," mountains at the farthest navigable point of the Oker river, which connects to the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Sea"]]}," via the rivers Aller and Weser.\n\nThe date and circumstances of the town's foundation are unknown. Tradition maintains that Braunschweig was created through the merger of two settlements, one founded by Bruno II, a Saxon count who died before 1017 on one side of the river Oker - the legend gives the year 861 for the foundation - and the other the settlement of a legendary Count Dankward, after whom Castle Dankwarderode (",{"type":"''","value":["Dankward's clearing"]},"), which was reconstructed in the 19th century, is named. The town's original name of ",{"type":"''","value":["Brunswik"]}," is a combination of the name Bruno and Low German ",{"type":"''","value":["wik"]},", a place where merchants rested and stored their goods. The town's name therefore indicates an ideal resting-place, as it lay by a ford across the Oker River. Another explanation of the city's name is that it comes from ",{"type":"''","value":["Brand"]},", or burning, indicating a place which developed after the landscape was cleared through burning. The city was first mentioned in documents from the St. Magni Church from 1031, which give the city's name as ",{"type":"''","value":["Brunesguik"]},".\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Brunswick cathedral.JPG"],["thumb"],["175px"],["Brunswick Cathedral \/w Lion"]]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nBrunswick was a city of importance in medieval Germany. Economically, it was situated at the intersections of major trade routes; moreover, the river Oker was navigable from Brunswick, allowing access to the sea port of Bremen. It was among the last nine cities of the Hanseatic League.\n\nPolitically, Brunswick gained importance through one of its most important rulers, Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony and Bavaria. During his reign, Henry founded several German cities (among them ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Schwerin"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Munich"]]},"), defying his cousin German Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa, and married Richard the Lionheart's sister Matilda of England, thus establishing familial ties to the royal family of England, which still exist to this day. His son, Otto of Brunswick, was crowned German emperor in 1209. To document his claim to power, Henry had the Lion monument erected in 1166, which also appears in the city's coat of arms. You can still find the red lion on the coat of arms of Scotland and the British Royal Family today.\n\nBrunswick is considered having been one of the most tumultuous cities of Late Medieval and Early Modern Europe (next to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Paris"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ghent"]]},"). Numerous constitutional conflicts ended in uprisings and civil unrest.\n\nDespite its rich medieval tradition, Brunswick's appearance today owes much to its almost complete destruction during World War II. Allied bombing destroyed 90% of Brunswick's medieval city center (leaving only 80 of formerly over 800 timberframe houses). Only a small number of buildings have been re-erected; the majority of downtown buildings nowadays exhibit the somberness of 1950's post-war architecture.\n\nAn important industrial hub, the district of Brunswick is home to many companies, such as the steel industry in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Salzgitter"]]}," (Salzgitter AG) and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Peine"]]},", or Volkswagen in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wolfsburg"]]},".\n\nThe region of Braunschweig is the most R&D-intensive area in the whole European Economic Area investing a remarkable 7.1% of its GDP in the research & technology sector (places two and three go to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Varsinais-Suomi"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["East Anglia"]]}," with 4.1% each). It is home to the ",{"type":"''","value":["Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt"]}," (PTB), the national institute for natural and engineering sciences and the highest technical authority for metrology and physical safety engineering in Germany. Part of its assignments is the accurate measurement of time. It is responsible for the German atomic clock CS2 and the longwave time signal DCF77. In addition, the PTB operates time servers for the distribution of time on the internet.\n\nBrunswick is further known for its universities ",{"type":"''","value":["Technische Universität Carolo-Wilhelmina zu Braunschweig"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["Hochschule für Bildende Künste Braunschweig"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["Ostfalia Hochschule für angewandte Wissenschaften"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["Welfenakademie Braunschweig"]},", and 19 research institutes, among them the Johann Heinrich von Thuenen Institute (until the end of 2007 named Federal Agricultural Research Center), and the Helmholtz Center for Infection Research.\n\nBraunschweig was declared Germany's City of Science 2007.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nThe nearest commercial airport is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hannover Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["HAJ"]]},") ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.hannover-airport.de\/"]}," (approximately 30–40 minutes by car, or around 1 hour by train).
