[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Bruny Island banner road and hill.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.brunyisland.org.au Bruny Island"]}]}," is an island of stunning natural beauty, close to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hobart"]]},", in the state of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tasmania"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Australia"]]},".  It's a possible day-trip from Hobart, but with boutique accommodation and plenty to offer for longer stays.  The island is divided into North and South Bruny, joined by a narrow isthmus.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Understand "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Albino Macropus rufogriseus rufogriseus.jpg"],["right"],["thumb"],["Bruny Island White Wallaby"]]},"\n\nNorth Bruny is mainly farmland, and is relatively flat.  South Bruny is more mountainous, and is more heavily forested.  The national park sections are on South Bruny.\n\nThe main town for visitors is Adventure Bay on South Bruny.  This is where the cruises depart from, and is adjacent to one of the three discrete sections of South Bruny National Park.  There is accommodation here, and a bowling club for drinks and meals.  If you are going to spot the White Wallaby, along the national park track here at dusk is your best chance, and the rainforest and walks are in the hills just about the town.  Not far from Adventure Bay is the town of Allonah.  Not as much of a tourist centre, you'll find the post office, pharmacy and the pub here, as well as walks along the water.\n\nThere are smaller settlements, a few cafes and produce centres scattered around.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nKettering, the gateway to Bruny Island, is around 30 minutes drive south from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hobart"]]},", through the sleepy townships of Margate, Snug and Oyster Cove. For a more interesting drive, you can divert through Kingston Beach and Blackmans Bay.  From Kettering, you can catch the vehicular ferry,  ",{"type":"''","value":["The Mirambeena"]},", across to Bruny Island.  The ferry costs $30 return.  You pay the full amount at Kettering, and the return trip is \"free\".  The crossing takes around 15 minutes, and the ferry departs promptly.  You're expected to be there around 15 minutes ahead of the ferry departure time.  You are allowed to walk around on the ferry apart from when it is mooring, however there are no passenger facilities - not so much as a shelter.\n\nAt both the Kettering and Roberts Bay termini you can buy snacks and coffee.  There are also public toilets at the terminals, but none on the ferry.\n\nThere is no car hire on Bruny, so you'll have to hire a car from Hobart.  Some hire car companies don't allow their cars to be driven on to the island, so check before you book.  Even those that do, may not actually insure you for an accident on the ferry itself.  This is difficult to avoid if you aren't bringing your own car.\n\nFoot passengers are carried on the ferry free of charge, but it is difficult to take advantage of this bargain offer, with no public transport available at either ferry terminus.\n\nIf you are taking the tour of the island, the tour company offers a connecting bus.\n\nBruny Island has a small airport for general aviation and charters.  The airport is not within walking distance of any accommodation or facilities, so you'll need to arrange for someone to pick you up.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nBruny Island is approximately 100 km from one end to the other.  Essentially, there is one road that stretches the length of the island (Bruny Island Main Road), with branch roads to towns, beaches and attractions.  Expect to take around 45 minutes to drive between the ferry and Adventure Bay or Allonah at the north of the South Island.  Then another half an hour or so from there down to Cape Bruny.\n\nThe advisory speed limit drops to 45 km\/h on many parts of the main road between dusk and dawn - due to the danger of hitting wildlife.  Also, remember that the insurance on many rental cars does not cover damage done to their cars hitting wildlife between dusk and dawn.\n\nThe common ways to explore are by private car or by tour.  There is no scheduled public transport on the island.  There are no facilities provided on the narrow shoulders for cyclists.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Eudyptula minor family exiting burrow.jpg"],["right"],["thumb"],["Little Penguins on Bruny"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" History "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Bligh Museum"],["url=http:\/\/www.bruny-island.net\/bligh-museum.htm"],["email="],["address=Main Rd, Adventure Bay - Many artifacts relating to early Bruny history and the first explorers - particularly  Cook and Bligh"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Bruny History Room"],["url=http:\/\/www.bruny-island.net\/history-room.htm"],["email="],["address=Main Rd, Alonnah - Early and recent history.  many artifacts, photos, documents and newspaper cuttings provided by Bruny residents"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cape Bruny Lighthouse"]}," was one of Australia's longest serving lighthouses guiding seafarers through some at-times treacherous waters.
