It is entirely surrounded by Dutch-speaking ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Flanders"]]}," and its constituent ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Flemish Brabant"]]}," province.

Being at the crossroads of cultures (the Germanic in the North and the Romance in the South) and playing an important role in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Europe"]]},", Brussels fits the definition of the archetypal \"melting pot\", but still retains its own unique character. The population of the city of Brussels is 1 million and the population of Brussels metropolitan area is just over 2 million.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Brussels skyline gp.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Skyline of Brussels"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Historic Center.JPG"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Grand Place-Grote Markt"]]},"\n\nWhen Brussels became the capital city of a new country in the 19th century, the old town was destroyed to make way for brand new ministries, palaces, schools, army barracks and office blocks constructed between 1880 and 1980. Only a small historic centre (one square and four adjacent streets) was preserved.  The historic Flemish town centres are better preserved in other cities: ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Antwerp"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bruges"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ghent"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Courtray"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Leuven"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mechelen"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oostende"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Language"]},"\n\nBrussels operates as a bilingual city where both French (80%) and Dutch (Flemish) (20%) are official languages. Thus all the streets have two names, which can sound totally different. For example, the Main Square is called both ",{"type":"''","value":["la Grand Place"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["de Grote Markt"]},". Although officially bilingual, French is undoubtedly Brussels' lingua franca. English is also widely understood, but not always widely spoken. Visitors should realize that language is a very divisive issue in Belgium (though this is not as noticeable in Brussels).\n\nHistorically Dutch-speaking, Brussels became more and more French-speaking during the 19th and 20th centuries. Today, most inhabitants speak French in daily life. Some numbers say that more than half of the inhabitants of Brussels do not speak French at home. The Brussels dialect, a Brabantian dialect of Dutch, can be heard, especially in the outer districts of Brussels Capital Region. French speakers shouldn't have too much trouble understanding the local French. Dutch speakers may have some difficulty with the Belgian Dutch accent.\n\nEnglish has become a common spoken language because of the international institutions based in Brussels, such as the European Commission, the European Parliament and NATO. It is still relatively rare to find written tourist or general information in English, although the situation is improving greatly. One can expect public announcements in train stations to at least be said in French and Dutch, while larger train stations (such as Zuidstation\/Gare Du Midi) typically include English and sometimes German. English is also used on metros, trams and buses, announced last for information such as line transfers and terminal stops. Do not hesitate to ask someone if you do not understand what has been said.\n\nConsidering the city's location and that it markets itself as the capital of Europe, spoken English is less prevalent in Belgium than in its Dutch neighbor. However, even if it is not as widely spoken as one may expect, it is nonetheless widely understood. As is often the case elsewhere, success in finding someone who speaks English depends on several factors such as age (14-35 year-olds are most likely to speak English).\n\nGerman is also an official language in Belgium spoken as a mother tongue by about 70,000 people in the east of the country bordering Germany, but you are very unlikely to encounter German speakers outside the German-speaking region in Belgium.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh = 6"],["febhigh = 6"],["marhigh = 10"],["aprhigh = 13"],["mayhigh = 18"],["junhigh = 20"],["julhigh = 22"],["aughigh = 23"],["sephigh = 19"],["octhigh = 14"],["novhigh = 9"],["dechigh = 7"],["janlow = 1"],["feblow = 1"],["marlow = 3"],["aprlow = 5"],["maylow = 9"],["junlow = 12"],["jullow = 14"],["auglow = 13"],["seplow = 11"],["octlow = 8"],["novlow = 4"],["declow = 2"],["janprecip = 71"],["febprecip = 53"],["marprecip = 73"],["aprprecip = 54"],["mayprecip = 70"],["junprecip = 78"],["julprecip = 69"],["augprecip = 64"],["sepprecip = 63"],["octprecip = 68"],["novprecip = 79"],["decprecip = 79"],["description = See the Brussels forecast at ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.worldweather.org\/053\/c00191.htm World Meteorological Organization"]}]]},"\n\nBrussels deservedly has a poor reputation for its weather.

The dampness makes the weather feel much colder than it is. The daily and monthly temperature variations are quite small. Daily differences between average highs and average lows don't exceed 9°C (16°F).\n\nIn the summer, average daily maximum temperatures rarely exceed 22°C (72°F). The summer visitor should always be prepared for rain in Brussels. Warm and sunny weather is not constant during that season or even to be expected.\n\nAfter October, temperatures drop off quite rapidly and winter months are damp and chilly.

Single tickets cost €2.10 if pre-purchased and are available from the driver for €2.50 (only trams, not metro).\n\nYou validate the ticket in the small orange machines located in buses\/trams, or at the entrance to metro stations\/major tram stops. The orange machines time-stamp the ticket, both in ink and magnetically, and it will be valid for one hour. You can interrupt your ride and interchangeably use any STIB\/MIVB transport. You should revalidate your ticket for each new ride.\n\nOne-, five- and ten-ride tickets are available at almost all metro and train stations. A card that can be used for ten rides on public transport costs €13.00. There is also a ",{"type":"'''","value":["1 day pass"]}," available for €6.50. These tickets can be purchased either at staffed windows or from kiosks. However, the kiosks do not accept many credit and debit cards and only accept cash payments in coins.\n\nRemember that a 10-ride ticket can be used by more than one person.  For example, if two of you are traveling together, you can just buy one 10-ride ticket, and when you enter the bus, or metro or tram, you validate the ticket twice by inserting the ticket twice into the small orange machine.  As soon as the ticket is spat out, you insert it again, and the machine will say two persons, and there will be two lines on the ticket to indicate this. If you know you're going to use the bus or tram, getting the 10-ride pass might be cheaper than getting individual tickets.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bike"]},"\n\nSince 2009, the city offers low-cost short-term \"Villo\" rentals at 180 locations near the central city.

Some suburban neighbourhoods have a poor reputation, but most travellers are unlikely to visit them. The neighbourhoods of Schaarbeek, Brussels North, St-Josse, Marollen, Anneessens, Molenbeek and Anderlecht should be avoided at night if possible.\n\nHowever, pickpockets, sometimes in teams, operate in crowded tourist areas, and the train and metro stations (particularly at night) as well as parks (even in daytime) attract drug addicts and other shady types. Travellers should be particularly alert for distractions such as being asked for the time or directions and having attention diverted from their hand or shopping bag. Particularly popular at the moment seems to be the \"soccer move distraction\", when they suddenly stick their foot between your legs as if they are playing an imaginary soccer game. Avoid travelling with laptops at any time.\n\nIn the ",{"type":"''","value":["Parc de Bruxelles\/Warandepark"]},", between the Royal Palace and the Belgian Parliament, criminals have been noted threatening their victims with violence. Do not leave your bags unwatched but keep them close to your body. If you are robbed, there is a police office right next to the gate in front of the  Belgian Parliament (on the right side when leaving the park, hidden in the bushes) where experienced policemen will help you. Most of them speak French, Dutch and English well.\n\nIn addition to the above advice be aware of Brussels Midi-Zuid train station, one of the poorest areas in the city: it is not advised to wander there alone at night.\n\nIn train stations, especially the Nord-Noord train station, scam artists show up in groups trying to distract you with some questions and steal your belongings. They are really professional, and business travelers are often targeted.
