Once bought (you will need some ID to do that) the cards can be loaded with various ticketing options, including some that allow usage on both the subway and surface networks. To validate the card after entering a vehicle (or subway station) hold it still in front of the validating device (an orange box with a small LCD screen) until you hear a short beep (The LCD display will show \"Calatorie Placuta\" = Have a nice trip). If you hear a long beep followed by the message \"Repetati validarea la acelasi validator\" = \"Repeat the validation on the same machine\" or any other message, please validate the card again. It is very common in this system to give errors very often, so it recommendable to be sure that you have paid for your trip. If you want to be sure that you have paid, press the button 1 and hold the card near the validator, it will mention the amount left and for how many passengers it was validated. To validate it for more than one passenger (this is available only for electronic wallet not for daily\/weekly\/monthly pass), you have to press the button no. 2 and hold the card near the validator. For any other additional traveler you have to press 2 again and receive the message \"Calatorie Placuta\" for each passenger. The paper tickets valid for one ride on one route are not any more available (they were removed starting with May 2011). Be warned that you cannot buy tickets\/cards in the vehicles and if caught by an inspector (",{"type":"''","value":["controlor"]},") you could be fined with 50 lei. Some buses still use the old system of paper ticket, essentially a strip of paper that needs to be validated inside the bus. Be sure to validate your ticket, as enforcers can be very strict, even to visitors unfamiliar with the system. A ticket is valid only on the bus\/tram\/trolley where it was validated. If you change the bus\/tram\/trolley, you have to validate again the card. Also, the ticket is valid only for one trip with the transport vehicle from one end to the other. However, in Bucharest most of the buses and trolleys will have one end (usually in downtown, where is no space for creating proper \"end of the line\" stops) without any distinct stop, so you will not be aware that you have to validate again, being liable to receive a fine.\nFor this reason, is better to buy a daily (8 RON = 1.8 Euro) or weekly pass (17 RON = 4 Euro) for your trips in Bucharest, because the pass will not require any validation. The prices are very small compared with the travel options available (buses, night buses, trams and trolleys), so the pass will help you to have a trip without any headaches.\n\nStarting with July 2011, the night buses are also available. They will run between 23:00 to 01:00, every 30 minutes, 1 to 5:00, every 1 hour and 5:00 to 6:00, every 30 minutes.

So, read carefully and remember that ",{"type":"''","value":["noapte"]}," means night. And you should insist the driver starts the meter, and pay the sum displayed on it. If you are traveling outside the city limits (say to or from the airport) prices per km and per hour are often doubled, or an extra 10-15 lei is added to the fare. Be wary of taking taxis from places where a lot of tourists pass through, especially from Gara de Nord. Many of these taxis may be operated by con men. Tourists being asked to pay large sums to recover their luggage from the trunk or even muggings after taxi rides are not unheard of.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Palatul Parlamentului 1b.jpg"],["thumb"],["Parliament Palace"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landmarks"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Parliament Palace"],["alt=Palatul Parliamentului"],["url=http:\/\/www.cdep.ro\/pls\/dic\/site.page?id=10"],["email="],["address=Strada Izvor 2-4"],["lat=44.4274"],["long=26.0874"],["directions=near Piaţa Unirii (Union Plazza). - M1, 3 'Izvor' - entrance is on the north side"],["phone=+40 21 3160300"],["hours="],["price=different Tours ranging in price from 25 RON (15 RON for students, proof required) up to 43 RON."],["content= the tourist can see the world's second largest building (after the US Pentagon), formerly named \"Casa Poporului\" (People's House).

Taking taxis from areas frequented by foreign tourists may also pose a threat as some of these taxis may be operated by con men waiting for an unsuspecting victim. This is especially true for taxis around Gara de Nord where their associates actively try to lure you into such cars. If possible, avoid taking cabs from Gara de Nord unless you are familiar with the taxi operators there.\n\nOne rule of thumb is to go with older taxi drivers, since they will be more cautious and only try to get a bit extra out of you if they scam you, unlike young drivers who will claim a trip costs 3-5 times as much as it should, may claim the meter does not work, and may try intimidation tactics to make you pay. The company the taxi driver is working at and the prices should be written on the car and the driver's ID card (issued by his employer) should be visible and should contain his photo.\n\nBe very careful of unsolicited offers of help by passersby, even if they have good English. In particular if a stranger offers to accompany you to your hostel or hotel in a taxi to show you the way, decline immediately. They are often working in tandem with unlicensed taxi drivers who will attempt to scam you, drop you at incorrect (and remote) locations while demanding exorbitant payment, or who will simply steal your luggage. A common scam is for a stranger to tell you that a place is not safe, and to direct you to an official \"government\" or \"student\" taxi, that is driven by an accomplice. They will then drive you a remote location, and demand high sums of money, possibly threatening you with violence if you don't comply.\n\nBe also careful when boarding or leaving trains. Scamsters have been known to impersonate other passengers, and enter couchettes or sleeping booths on trains while the occupant politely waits outside, and then steal from luggage. When requesting assistance on boarding trains, deal only with the conductor and if anyone asks you for information, demand to see ID.\n\nAs strange as it sounds, you'll see that Bucharest is a far safer city than its western European counterparts. Statistically Bucharest is one of the safest capitals in Europe, far safer than cities like Berlin, London, Rome, etc.  Nevertheless, possibly moreso than the aforementioned counterparts, violence is not an uncommon solution, towards locals or towards foreign looking people (minorities, out of place individuals, etc.) in any club, but particularly those playing ethnic music, especially when drinking and after hours are involved. However, just avoiding any conflict, particularly with people who have the air of \"owning the place\" or a mafioso look would reduce your chances to almost zero. Generally speaking, the larger and richer the city, the fewer problems you'll have.\n\nBucharest has perhaps the largest population of stray dogs for a city in eastern Europe. Although their numbers are gradually decreasing due to projects by the City Hall, they still remain a threat to safety and, at night, they tend to form packs which greatly increases their danger. Rabies vaccinations are recommended but not required, as there have been no rabies cases in Bucharest since 1979. Most dogs will not give you a problem unless you go out of your way to pester them, but many dogs have been treated poorly. Be extremely wary of them, and do not approach a stray dog if you are alone. It is perhaps best to walk around in a group or walk where you see other people. As of 2009, stray dogs are an ever more rare sighting in the city center.\n\nLike most other big cities, walking around at night isn't safe in some parts of the city like Pantelimon, Ferentari, Giulesti, and the Gara de Nord area. If you must travel into these neighbourhoods, it's safer to take a taxi.\n\nGara de Nord is not particularly dangerous to walk in, but avoid suspicious-looking characters, and if you feel that you are being followed, just walk into the station. Gara de Nord and its surroundings are populated by homeless people and children. Be careful, as many street children use an inhalant drug (equivalent to huffing paint) and may be dangerous. As heartbreaking as this problem is, it's best to avoid any contact. If you do wish to give them something, buy food for them, don't give them money.\n\nFerentari is a gypsy enclave in Bucharest and, while not as dangerous as it used to be, it's not advisable to walk there at night. In fact it is better to avoid it completely. For the traveler, there is nothing of interest there so you should have no reason to go there to begin with.\n\nThe unofficial red light district is Mătăsari, which is also a popular place for clubbers and pubs; you can walk there without any worries because it's always crowded and lively, but avoid talking to strangers in that particular area, especially Gypsies. As of 2009 there have been a lot of crackdowns on pimps and prostitutes in the Matasari area, so be careful or you might wind up spending a night in jail and with a hefty fine if caught soliciting.\n\nIn the event that you do get caught in a police raid, do not attempt to bribe your way out of it with so many of them around as you might get into serious trouble. Police are more inclined to take bribes from locals than from foreigners so do not contribute to this phenomenon that has been plaguing this country for so many years. Police corruption has been vigorously fought in the past years, and it is not as generalized as it used to be in the 1990s. It's always better to walk on boulevards and avoid alleys and backstreets.\n\nThe crime rate is low, but a traveler must always be cautious. Violent attacks are very low, but if attacked just yell, \"Ajutor!\". It is very difficult for anyone to get away with violent crime because as everything is packed so closely together, any loud noise will attract attention. This is truly a city that doesn't sleep. You'll find people out and around at all hours in most parts of the city. Police men are pretty friendly and the younger ones speak English, so you can ask directions. In the event that you do need to report a crime to the police, do not hesitate and proceed to the nearest police station. They will often help you to the best of their ability.\n\nOne must be incredibly careful as a pedestrian in Bucharest. Drivers are inconsiderate and often do not obey traffic signals. NEVER assume a car will stop for you at a red light—be vigilant at all times. This is definitely the ",{"type":"'''","value":["biggest"]}," hazard in Bucharest, not so much in the daytime, when crowded streets make it impossible to drive cars at high speeds, but, at night, the streets clear out, a lot of illegal races taking place with reckless driving on main boulevards.\n\nWhen sewer lids are removed from the street, pedestrians often aren't protected. Pay attention where you step!\n\nAsian tourists are more likely to be seen as an easy mark for dishonest taxi drivers and other criminals. It does not make a difference if you are Asian-American or are from Asia. Some young Asian women may also get a lot of perverted looks from men all around the city - be prepared to be stared at especially if you are traveling alone, though some men will stare no matter what.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\n\nThose with allergies may find Bucharest annoying in that it is both hot and very dusty in the summer, with temperatures easily exceeding 30 C in July and August, so bring whatever you might need to stay comfortable. Please note that during the summer, sun strokes and heat strokes can be very dangerous.\n\nPharmacies are usually open between 9AM and 6PM, but some will stay open through the night. In Romania, there are relatively few over-the-counter drugs available, but pharmacists are allowed to dispense limited quantities of some prescription drugs (such as pain relief medicine) for what they see as immediate needs. Bucharest has 6 designated emergency hospitals and a modern ambulance service, plus a large number of additional public and private hospitals, clinics, and dental practices.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Embassies"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["Finland"]]},"  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Finland"],["url=http:\/\/www.finland.ro"],["email=sanomat.buk@formin.fi"],["address=Strada Atena 2 bis, Bucuresti  011832"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+40 21-230 7504"],["tollfree="],["fax=+40 21-230 7505"],["hours=Mo-Th 8AM-4:15PM, Fr-3PM"],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"==","value":["Go next "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Snagov"]]}],["alt="],["url="],["lat=44.7075"],["long=26.1732"],["directions=20 km north"],["content=is a small town, and a quick escape from the city for many locals, with its big lake and beaches.
