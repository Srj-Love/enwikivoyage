There is mainly one street, the main promenade, where all the action happens. \n\nBudva appears to be undergoing poorly planned, unchecked growth with towering apartment buildings and hotels being built wherever there is open space - which unfortunately includes building close to the beach.  \n\nSome tourists may find Budva disappointing and cheesy because of the over-crowded beaches filled with chairs, umbrellas and loud music in some places.  Prices for food and accommodation are also well above what can be found in less popular resorts.\n\nThe old town itself is adjacent to the marina, where the wealthy come to moor their luxury yachts.

At first the path follows the Slovenska Plaza and at the end of ther beach then passes through a tunnel (thankfully re-opened) under the half finished and now abandoned monstrosity of  development by the Russian company Mirax.  From there make your way through the car parks of the various hotels to the beach of Becici until it reaches the village of Rafailovici. Here the path continues through a recently built tunnel, passes the Kamenovo beach area and follows the coast to a place called Zoff’s fish restaurant. Now the path turns to the left and up a set of steps to the main road. Turn right at the Kusta grill restaurant and walk along the main road for about 300 metres. Before the end of the viaduct there are steps leading down to Przno beach. If you pass in front of the Maestral Hotel, walk through the beach restaurants and go left up the hill at the end of the beach there is a gate that is sometimes open.  Oherwise, keep to the left of the Maestral Hotel and go through the arch gate just past the bus stop and taxi rank. Keep walking, and after the next hotel, Kraljicina Plaza, you can either continue along the same road or choose the more beautiful beach path. Both options take you all the way to Sveti Stefan. Take the bus back for €2, the stop is very incognito but it comes often so you can usually see a group of people standing around and there is your station."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Nearby beaches: ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bečići"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["Miločer"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["Pržno"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["Kamenovo"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kotor"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bar"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ulcinj"]]}," - Several buses leaving early morning around 7, schedule changes frequently so inquire at the bus station for specifics."]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Budva Riviera"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Geo"],["42.28290"],["18.83777"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Budva"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Budva"]]}]
