Most of the city grid is divided into equal squares with block numbers in the hundreds, using a grid system similar to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Manhattan"],["Manhattan, New York"]]},". Most streets are one way with the adjacent parallels going the other way, so beware that the bus or taxi won't follow the same route back.

Make sure to take the \"radio taxi\", as some taxis do no turn on the meter and will ask for a very expensive fare.\n\nIt's relatively quite safe to travel by taxis. For details refer to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Stay safe"],["Stay safe"]]},". If you are uncomfortable hailing a taxi on the street you can have your hotel or restaurant call a taxi for you. You should always check the driver´s personal information is legible in the back part of the front seat, and make sure they turn on the meter after they set off, to avoid any disagreement over the fare later. It is suggested to use small bills and exact or almost exact changes with taxis, since as with many large cities around the world, it sometimes can be quite problematic of getting changes back from a taxi driver.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Buenos Aires - Colectivo 68 - 120227 145031.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["One of the many bus lines in Buenos Aires."]]},"\nThe principal means of public transportation within the city are the buses (",{"type":"''","value":["colectivos"]},"). Tickets must be bought on the bus through a machine that accepts coins only or a prepaid RFID proximity card named SUBE, that works with every city bus or metro. Trips paid with the SUBE card cost half of prices paid with cash. Prices range from 2.50\/5.00 Pesos for short trips (3km) to 4.50\/9.00 Pesos for the longest trips of more than 27km (by April 2014).  \n\nThere are more than one hundred lines covering the whole city. They work 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, but run less frequently on holidays and late at night. For each route the bus is painted differently making them easy to distinguish. The best way to figure out the bus system is to buy a Guía \"T\". It's essentially a little book with a directory of streets, which corresponds to map pages, and has bus listings on the facing page for each map. Once you get your hands on one, it's very easy to figure out, but give yourself fifteen minutes the first few times you use it to plan a route. These can be bought at many kiosks around the city, or subway stations.\n\nOtherwise, visitors who are comfortable with speaking a little Spanish can call 131, a toll-free free telephone number from any phone, to help you find which ",{"type":"''","value":["colectivo"]}," to take. You just have to tell the corner (or the street and the number) where you're at and the one you want to get to.\n\nOn most services, board the bus and tell the driver your destination (or do what Argentines do—just say \"un Peso venticinco, por favor\" that literally means \"a Peso twenty five, please\". Meaning you'll be traveling a normal distance and want to pay 1,25 Peso); he will press a button instructing the coin machine to take a certain amount of money for you, which will then appear on the machine as the amount to insert. Step a bit further back into the bus and insert coins into the machine which now knows your destination and has calculated your fare because the driver punched it in. You will receive change and your ticket automatically, collect it at the bottom of the machine.\n\nIf you're using the SUBE proximity card, just show your card to the driver, and also say the ticket price or your destination. Just wait for the driver to selects your destination on his panel, you will notice the amount to be paid on the display of the yellow reader with the SUBE label next to him. You can then use the card against it and the payment will be processed, and the balance of the card will be shown. Please note that no actual ticket will  given to you when paying by SUBE card. DO NOT use the card before the driver selects your destination, since he may still be in the processing of processing your order and say \"NO, TODAVIA\" (\"No, I'm still selecting the destination\", or \"NOT YET!\").\n\nIf you see a little metal knob on the coin machine, it's not for dispensing your ticket like the candy\/toy machines in grocery stores. It's the service panel to the inside of the machine to change the paper and so on. Don't turn it! It's meant to be used for service only.\n\nYou can also use buses to move in and around the suburban area (",{"type":"''","value":["Gran Buenos Aires"]},"), but the fares are higher (up to 2 Pesos, depending on the distance and service).

If you need to be somewhere by 9AM or 9:30AM on a weekday, however, the Subte will be incredibly crowded and depending on where you are catching it from, you may have to miss several trains in a row before there is space for you.

Transferring between lines is indicated by ",{"type":"''","value":["combinación"]}," signs.\n\nYou can buy reusable tickets and add credit on them which can be used for several trips saving you from having to always go to the cashier to purchase individual tickets. Tickets are not swiped or taken away upon exiting stations, therefore you may use one magnetic stripe ticket for more than one traveler, as long as it has the required number of fares.\n\nThe current network comprises six underground lines, labelled \"A\" to \"E\" and \"H\" which all converge to the downtown area and connect to the main bus and train terminals.\n\nThe A line used to be a destination on its own because of the old wooden carriages. It was built in 1913 making it the oldest metro system in Latin America, the Southern Hemisphere, and the entire Spanish-speaking world. The old wooden carriages have been replaced in 2013.\n\nIn the southeast branch (the E line), the service is extended by a trainway known as ",{"type":"''","value":["premetro"]},", but beware, it goes to some of the least desirable places in the city.

There are several things to keep in mind before renting a car in Buenos Aires. First, Buenos Aires is such an excellent city for walking that if something is within 20 or 30 blocks, it is often worth the extra effort to go on foot and get to know the city on a more intimate level. The terrain is flat, so it's can be easily walked on. Second, if you aren't much of a walker, the public transportation system in Buenos Aires is cheap and efficient. It can get you anywhere fast!  Third, and perhaps most important, the traffic in Buenos Aires is extremely unpredictable. Stoplights, signs, traffic laws—for many porteño drivers, are mere ",{"type":"''","value":["references"]},". Picture yourself trying to get several thousand heads of cattle to move down the street and stay inside the lanes, and you have a decent idea of driving in Buenos Aires. It's also very difficult to find where to park your car in many neighborhoods, and close to impossible in downtown. Do NOT leave your car parked where you're not supposed to because it will be towed away, and the recovery fee is VERY EXPENSIVE. Many hidden speed control cameras have been installed lately (specially in avenues), so be sure to stick to the speed limit, even in routes outside the city. DO fasten your seat belt and have your lights turned on or you will be fined.\n\nIf driving outside the city, you should not only stick to the speed limit (which varies a lot depending on where you are), but have your identification and driving license with you, as it's possible that you get stopped by traffic control policemen. National routes are in a good state of maintenance, but be careful in province only routes as there may be unexpected and dangerous potholes in the pavement.\n\nThere is also the option to do private car tours. One (fun) option is to go for Buenos Aires Vintage Tours, which offers original Citroën 3CVs to do the tour. Check ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.buenosaires-vintage.com.ar\/ Buenos Aires Vintage"]}," for details on available tours.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bicycle"]},"\n\nBuenos Aires is not the most suitable city for cycling.

It was influenced by the many nationalities that immigrated here as well.\n\nIf you have studied Spanish, you will find these differences enormous. Also, vocabulary differs a lot from Iberian Spanish or other Latin American varieties of Spanish, so may be useful to get an Argentinian dictionary or take some lessons of Argentinian Spanish before getting there.

Conduct yourself intelligently as you would in any large city.\n\nThe most frequent incidents of crime involve distraction theft, bag snatching, and armed robberies in the street, in taxis and in restaurants. Distraction thefts commonly occur in public areas such as internet cafes, train stations, and bus stations. You should keep a close eye on your personal possessions and bags at all times. In some public spaces you will find that chairs with webbing and clips to clip to your bag or purse to the chair. An aid in avoiding problems is, dress to blend in and avoid carrying lots of items. It safer to travel just the bare necessities in your front pocket.\n\nWhile using public transportation or walking around common sense should be used (as in every big city).\n\nIn a common scam one person sprays something on the victim like hand cream mustard or the like. Another person tries to help the victim. There can be several people at once working in coordination. The object is to distract you from your belongings and, in the chaos, steal from you. Avoiding confrontation is their object so do the same. Ignore their 'help', just focus on your belongings and extracting yourself from the scene.\n\nAnother common occurrence is the slitting of handbags in crowded places. Be particularly attentive in popular tourist areas, such as San Telmo.  You should avoid carrying large amounts of cash or wearing ostentatious jewelery.\n\nFor kidnappings (very rare with tourists), victims are grabbed off the street based on their appearance and vulnerability. They are made to withdraw as much money as possible from ATM machines, the victim is usually quickly released unharmed.\n\nThe dangers of hailing a taxi has received lots of press but is not common. Petty crime continues (like taking indirect routes or incorrect changes during payment). Taxicabs that loiter in front of popular tourist destinations like the National Museum are looking for tourists, and some of these drivers are less honest than others. Do things like the  locals would be a good choice, like stopping a cab a block or two away on a typical city street.\n\nIf a woman (or even a man) apparently normally calls you on the street to see an \"apresentación\" and earn massage girls for free, without commitment, the first time, do not pay attention and leave! In fact, they are agents of brothels. Once taken  \"inside\", they do not let you out, physically preventing you, until they disburse a large sum of money. This type of scam is relatively common in the center, especially in Corrientes Avenue, Florida Street, and Lavalle Avenue.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Money"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Counterfeit money"]}," is frequent, especially from a regular exchanger of currencies from people of various lifestyles (like taxi drivers), so be on the lookout for counterfeit bank notes being given with your change. Some counterfeit notes are very well done and may even have what appears to be a watermark. Get to know the notes and exactly what they look and feel like, also identify the water marks and serial numbers. When exiting a taxi, hold up your notes to the light to check them before final exit, or better yet, use exact change in taxis.\n\nBe careful of counterfeit money. There have been occasions where genuine bills have been exchanged for counterfeit  ones. Counterfeit bills are mostly fifties, given as changes. Hundreds are frequently given back to tourists by deceiving exchangers claiming that counterfeit bills were given to them, after they have switched the bill given to them with a fake one. Using exact or almost exact changes will pretty much solve most of this kind of problems.\n\nDon't accept torn or damaged bills, as they are difficult to use.\n\nCharacteristics of good currency can be found at the Argentine Central Bank web site ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.bcra.gov.ar\/"]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Ezeiza International Airport"]},"\n\nAs any large airports in many countries, there are records of airport staff stealing from the passengers.\n\nIn July 2007, Argentina's TV network \"Canal 13\" conducted an investigation revealing that several security operators at the airport are stealing valuable objects such as iPods, digital cameras, cellular phones, sun glasses, jewelry, laptops, and other valuables while scanning the luggage of passengers.\n\nAccording to the special report, security operators at the airport are supposed to check each luggage before putting it into the plane; however, some operators take advantage of the scanner machine to detect valuable objects and steal them. The report states that this event occurs every day. The stolen items include anything from electronic devices to perfumes and works of art or even expensive clothes (such as football jerseys or leather coats).\n\nTravelers and residents are strongly encouraged to ",{"type":"'''","value":["place high-value items in your carry-on luggage"]}," to prevent any incidents. However, since these carry-on luggages will be scanned too before being carried into the plane, their insides are also at risk of being stolen. With the staff or accomplice distracting the passengers (usually when the staff is searching  for any metal or other item on the passenger), while another staff or accomplice steal the items. Another extra accomplice from outside the airport will usually pick up the items later.\n\nWrapping your baggage and carry-on luggage when leaving and arriving is an idea, since for only around US $16,50. you can discourage robbers from opening (and probably breaking) it,. However for checked-in baggage, it can not be used for passengers exiting and entering the U.S.A., since the T.S.A. demanded that all checked-in baggage to be easily accessible. While wrapping a carry-on luggage will pretty much also denied you of quick access to the carry-on luggage.\n\nBefore and after check-in, It would be better to carry only 1 carry-on item and place all of your items (including tickets, wallets, handphones, any metal such like a beltbuckle, and so on) securely inside and not easily accessiblle, requiring the entire carry-on item to be stolen and only 1 item to be watched upon. Travelling in groups will also allow you to divide the task of minding your belongings, one person or more can guard the belongings, while another one is being scanned by the metal detector.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\n\nThe plumbing ",{"type":"'''","value":["water"]}," in Buenos Aires, unlike in many Latin American cities, is drinkable straight from the tap.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Public hospitals"]}," are   available for tourists, with 24 hr emergency service, without charge.\n\nThere are many stray animals in the city.
