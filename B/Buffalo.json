Buffalo is the cultural and economic center of the Western New York region. Though for the past half-century it has been rightly considered a stagnant working-class city that has suffered from the aftereffects of deindustrialization, Buffalo's economy has turned around significantly, with an unemployment rate in April 2014 of 5.8%, running below the national rate of 5.9% and the statewide rate of 6.1% for that month. Perhaps surprisingly given its history as a center of heavy industry, Buffalo has also recently been cited as the third-cleanest city in the United States. Recently, Buffalo was named one of the Dozen Distinctive Destinations for 2009 by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, whose 2011 National Preservation Conference was held in Buffalo and was the largest and best-attended of these annual conferences in the history of that organization. Other titles bestowed on Buffalo in recent years include a placement among the \"44 Places to Visit in 2009\" by the ",{"type":"''","value":["New York Times"]},", the \"All-America City Award\" for the years 1996 and 2002, and one of the 10 best cities in the U.S. to raise a family, according to a 2010 feature in ",{"type":"''","value":["Forbes"]}," magazine.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nThough the area had been settled by the Iroquois since well before Columbus and was visited periodically by French fur trappers beginning in the 17th Century, Buffalo's history ",{"type":"''","value":["per se"]}," begins about 1789, when Cornelius Winney set up a trading post at the mouth of the Buffalo River. At the time, this site was still far beyond the frontier of white settlement; it was not until 1793 when the Holland Land Company, a syndicate of investors from the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Netherlands"]]},", purchased the tract of Western New York wilderness that included Buffalo. Land agent Joseph Ellicott, who arrived at Winney's trading post in 1798, felt that it had the potential to be the site of a thriving city. He gave the name New Amsterdam to the village he laid out there, though it was soon renamed Buffalo after the adjacent river. (The question of where the Buffalo River itself got its name is still very much a mystery—the most well-known theory, which has the French explorer Sieur de la Salle exclaiming about the ",{"type":"''","value":["beau fleuve"]},", or \"beautiful river\", that he saw while sailing along Lake Erie in 1679, is almost certainly untrue; also, no buffalo or bison were known to have been present in Western New York at any time since the arrival of the white man, though 17th-century French explorers did find some living relatively nearby on the south shore of Lake Erie, in present-day ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ohio"]]},".)\n\nDespite Ellicott's aspirations, Buffalo remained a tiny outpost whose main claim to fame during its very early history was as the site of several important military installations and battles during the War of 1812 (famously, the village was burnt to the ground by British troops in December 1813 as part of the Niagara Frontier Campaign of that war). That all changed with the completion of the Erie Canal in 1825; the status of the western terminus of the canal was granted to Buffalo after a hotly contested dispute with the neighboring village of Black Rock (later to be annexed by its rival). The Erie Canal extended eastward from Lake Erie to the Hudson River at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Albany (New York)"],["Albany"]]},", a distance of 363 miles (584 km) in all. The most ambitious work of infrastructure undertaken in the U.S. up to that time, the Erie Canal greatly lowered transportation costs and singlehandedly made large-scale settlement of the lands west of the Appalachians economically viable. The magnitude of the Erie Canal's commercial importance is illustrated by the fact that in the first five years after its completion, Buffalo's population more than tripled (to 8,668); two years later, in 1832, Buffalo was finally incorporated as a city.\n\nBuffalo's early economic mainstay was as a transshipment port, where grain from the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Midwest (United States of America)"],["Midwest"]]}," was unloaded from lake freighters and transferred to canal boats headed for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New York City"]]},"; it was in Buffalo where the world's first grain elevator was constructed in 1843, and indeed there are still many elevators that remain standing around Buffalo Harbor. Over the second half of the 19th Century, the Erie Canal gradually became obsolete, but that scarcely affected Buffalo's explosive growth. Instead, the city maintained its status as a transportation hub by transitioning into the second-most important railroad center in the U.S. (after ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chicago"]]},"); the New York Central, Pennsylvania, Michigan Central, Nickel Plate, Erie, Delaware Lackawanna & Western, West Shore, Baltimore & Ohio, and Lehigh Valley Railroads all passed through Buffalo at the height of the railroad era. In addition, the steel industry became a major player in the local economy in 1899, when the Lackawanna Steel Company moved its base of operations from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Scranton"]]},", Pennsylvania to a site just south of the city line. By 1900, Buffalo boasted a population of over 350,000 and was one of the ten largest cities in the United States.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Canalside.jpg"],["thumb"],["350px"],["Located in the shadow of downtown, the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Commercial Slip"]}," (seen here) was once the western end of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Erie Canal"]},", which was built in 1825 and which transformed Buffalo almost overnight from a sleepy frontier village to one of the United States' fastest-growing cities and most important inland ports. It is now the centerpiece of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Canalside"]}," redevelopment on the downtown waterfront."]]},"\n\nThe Pan-American Exposition was a World's Fair that was held in Buffalo in 1901, at the apex of the city's glory days; it was intended to showcase, among other things, the technological marvel and economic possibilities of electric power (Buffalo's proximity to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Niagara Falls (New York)"],["Niagara Falls"]]},", a site of early ventures in the generation of hydroelectricity, gifted it with the cheapest electricity in the nation at the time). Though the dazzling sight of the fairgrounds, illuminated by night with this new technology, earned Buffalo the enduring nickname \"City of Light\", the Pan-American Exposition's main historical significance is much more somber in nature: it was at the Exposition on September 6, 1901, when U.S. President William McKinley was fatally shot by anarchist Leon Czolgosz, moments after concluding a speech at the Temple of Music.\n\nBuffalo continued to grow during the first part of the 20th Century. However, trends were beginning to emerge that would, by 1950, cause the city's growth to slow, stop and then reverse. As in other American cities, wealthier residents began to leave their homes in town for quieter, greener suburban properties outside the city line. This began in the 1910s and 1920s—many of Buffalo's older suburbs, such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tonawanda"],["Kenmore"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amherst (New York)"],["Eggertsville"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cheektowaga"],["Pine Hill"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amherst (New York)"],["Snyder"]]},", date to this time—and kicked into high gear during the post-World War II economic boom. At the same time, the growing American middle class began to migrate in ever-larger numbers to areas in the West and South with milder climates, at the further expense of the cities of the Northeast. The construction of the Interstate Highway System fueled suburbanization at the same time that it contributed to the decline of the railroads and of Buffalo's port, as goods could be shipped more cheaply by truck.\n\nHowever, the single most important cause of the free-fall that Buffalo suffered during the late 20th Century was the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959. Historically, Buffalo's importance as a port was largely due to the barrier that Niagara Falls posed to shipping. However, thanks to the expansion of the Welland Canal as part of the Seaway, freighters loaded with grain and other goods could now access the ocean directly via the St. Lawrence River, rather than stopping at Buffalo to transfer their cargo to railroad cars headed east. Within ten years of the Seaway's inauguration, most of the grain elevators at Buffalo Harbor had been abandoned, and the port that was once filled to capacity with ships was now nearly empty. As well, the steel plant in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lackawanna"]]}," closed its doors for good beginning in 1977, unable to compete with cheaper foreign steel. By 1980, Buffalo's population was roughly equal to what it had been in 1900, down nearly 40% from its peak of 580,132 just thirty years earlier.\n\nTo add insult to injury, during the 1960s and '70s Buffalo's civic leaders responded to the deteriorating social conditions in the city by demolishing (in the name of \"urban renewal\" and \"slum clearance\") ethnic neighborhoods in such places as the Ellicott District and the Lower West Side that, though working-class, were in many cases healthy and vibrant. In particular, the splendid brick Victorian cottages of what was once the Lower West Side's \"Little Italy\" were nearly all lost to the wrecking ball, while the new public housing projects erected in the Ellicott District soon became high-rise versions of the slums they replaced, as the mere construction of new buildings did nothing to address the underlying social problems in the neighborhood. At the same time, noisy and intrusive expressways were constructed directly through Delaware Park and Humboldt Parkway, destroying the verdant ambience of what were (respectively) the largest park and the grandest parkway designed for the city by landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted; thankfully, forceful opposition from neighborhood residents spared the Allentown Historic District a similar fate. In downtown, only one of the many examples of the senseless destruction of Buffalo's architectural heritage occurred in 1969, when several blocks of handsome Victorian commercial blocks as well as the stunning, castlelike Erie County Savings Bank building were demolished to make way for the Main Place Tower, a bland modernist office tower with an attached suburban-style shopping mall that utterly failed to attract shoppers back downtown in favor of the strip malls and plazas of the suburbs.\n\nDespite these grave problems, the mentality in Buffalo never crossed the line into total defeatism, which was helpful when Buffalo's decline started to level off in the 1990s. The broad-based grassroots protests that accompanied the opening of the Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino in 2007, which had been presented to the city as a means of spurring development and attracting tourists, serves as perhaps the quintessential example of the city's new approach: rather than relying on one-shot \"silver bullet\" solutions to the city's problems such as the casino, Buffalo has begun to model its strategy on the successful revival of other Rust Belt cities such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pittsburgh"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cleveland"]]},"—a strategy that has consisted of accepting the reality that heavy industry is gone for good and, instead, using the valuable resource of Buffalo's unusually high number of colleges and universities to encourage development of a diverse range of high-tech industries, such as the medical research and biotechnology ventures that have sprouted north of downtown under the aegis of the University of Buffalo Medical School. The business district, once replete with boarded-up storefronts and nearly deserted after the end of the workday and on weekends, has enjoyed a new measure of vitality due largely to the conversion of disused office space into high-end downtown apartments and condominiums, a commodity for which many Buffalonians were surprised to discover there was considerable pent-up demand. Additionally, Buffalo can boast of an architectural heritage that is still substantial despite the misadventures of the 1960s, a vibrant range of cultural institutions, and a perennially low cost of living. In the past few years, this new approach has engendered a newfound strength among Buffalo's preservationist community, a dogged devotion by its citizens to cultural attractions such as the Albright-Knox Art Gallery and the Buffalo Zoo, and continued diversification of the local economy. Conversely, what remains of Buffalo's traditional heavy industry has benefited from the mini-rebound in American manufacturing after the most recent recession; for example, despite General Motors' recent financial troubles, that company made substantial investments in its plant in nearby ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tonawanda"]]}," in 2010, adding several hundred new jobs in the process. Though Buffalo has not completely stemmed its population losses and there is still much progress yet to be made, the bit of swagger with which residents of the \"City of No Illusions\" carry themselves today, finally reinvigorated after decades of decline, is unmistakable.\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Imperial"],["janhigh = 32"],["febhigh = 34"],["marhigh = 42"],["aprhigh = 55"],["mayhigh = 67"],["junhigh = 76"],["julhigh = 80"],["aughigh = 79"],["sephigh = 71"],["octhigh = 59"],["novhigh = 48"],["dechigh = 36"],["janlow = 19"],["feblow = 20"],["marlow = 26"],["aprlow = 37"],["maylow = 48"],["junlow = 57"],["jullow = 62"],["auglow = 61"],["seplow = 54"],["octlow = 43"],["novlow = 34"],["declow = 24"],["janprecip = 3.2"],["febprecip = 2.5"],["marprecip = 2.9"],["aprprecip = 3.0"],["mayprecip = 3.1"],["junprecip = 3.7"],["julprecip = 2.9"],["augprecip = 3.3"],["sepprecip = 3.9"],["octprecip = 3.5"],["novprecip = 4.0"],["decprecip = 3.9"],["description = ",{"type":"{{","value":[["forecastNOAA"],["Buffalo"],["42.88644679999999"],["-78.8783689"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nBuffalo, although most famous for its winters, has four very pronounced seasons.\n\nIn the first half of winter, beginning in approximately November, the city can get ",{"type":"'''","value":["lake-effect snow"]},": cold winds blowing over the warmer waters of Lake Erie pick up a lot of water vapor, which is dumped as snow as soon as they reach land.  This usually ends in January, when the lake finally freezes over.  Contrary to popular myth, however, Buffalo is not the coldest or snowiest city in the country—or even in New York. The Buffalo airport averages 93 inches (236 cm) of snow per winter. On average, Buffalo only has 3 days per year where the recorded temperature dips below 0°F (-18°C). Buffalo's snowy reputation is based in large part on some of its most famous storms: The Blizzard of '77, and the October Storm of 2006, both which received a lot of media coverage; however, neither is a normal occurrence in the average Buffalo winter.\n\nSpring is rainy and cool up through the end of April. The temperatures can fluctuate wildly in March and April. It is not unusual to see snow one day, and a temperature in the mid-60s Fahrenheit (almost 20°C) the next.\n\nSummer tends to be very comfortable and sunny—in fact, Buffalo has more sunny summer days than any other major city in the Northeastern U.S. The moderating effects of Lake Erie have allowed Buffalo to be one of very few places in the United States where the temperature has never reached 100°F (38°C). On average Buffalo has 60 days a year with temperatures reaching over 80°F (27°C).\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Buffalo winter scene.jpg"],["thumb"],["350px"],["A typical winter day in Buffalo's historic West Village."]]},"\n\nFall is warm and beautiful as well.

From largest to smallest, these nodes are located in downtown Buffalo, at University Station (located at the outer end of the Metro Rail), and at the Portage Road Transit Center in Niagara Falls. Most of the buses whose routes begin and end downtown access the Buffalo Metropolitan Transportation Center directly; many also service the Buffalo-Exchange Street Amtrak station.\n\nThe Metro Rail extends along Main Street from the University at Buffalo's South Campus at the northeast corner of the city southward to Canalside in downtown Buffalo, a distance of 6.4 miles (10.3 km). With nearly 25,000 riders per day, the Metro Rail boasts the third-highest number of passengers per mile (km) among light-rail systems in the United States. The northern portion of the system is below ground. As the subway enters the downtown core, at the Theater District, it emerges from the tunnel and runs at street level for the remainder of its length. Rides on the above-ground portion of the Metro Rail are free of charge. To ride in the underground portion of the system, it costs $4.00 for a round-trip ticket, or $2.00 for a one-way ticket. The Metro Rail is a popular mode of transportation for employees and residents who live along the line and north of the city to commute downtown, and also for attendees of downtown events who want to avoid paying high prices for parking.\n\nThe NFTA eliminated the zoned fare system in October 2010. Generally speaking, rides on a single bus or light rail vehicle now cost $2.00 regardless of length.

An additional 50¢ surcharge per trip applies on Enhanced Express buses.\n\nThere are no free transfers between buses.

You can eat fish fry at some of Buffalo's nicer restaurants if you want, but this is still a working-class food at heart and, accordingly, the best fish fry is served by the smaller neighborhood watering holes and greasy spoons.

At the present time, there are about two dozen of them located all over the metro area, where local farmers, vintners, cheesemakers, and producers of other artisanal food products come to sell their goods directly to the public.

Two especially big clusters of hotels exist just south of the University of Buffalo's North Campus in Amherst, as well as around the Buffalo Niagara International Airport, where the arrival of discount airlines in Buffalo, cheap airport parking, and the highest airfares in North America out of Toronto have combined to spark a hotel boom comparable to downtown's.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\nThe area code for the entire Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area (as well as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chautauqua County"],["Chautauqua"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cattaraugus County"],["Cattaraugus Counties"]]}," to the south) is 716.

That being said, crime rates in Buffalo have fallen in recent years to levels not seen in half a century. What violent crime does occur on the East Side is usually drug- and gang-related and does not target tourists. Follow general precautions that would apply in any urban area—locking car doors, keeping valuables out of sight, being aware of your surroundings, etc.—and you should be fine pretty much anywhere.\n\nPanhandlers can be found occasionally on Chippewa Street downtown and in Allentown and the Elmwood Village, though not nearly to the degree of most other cities.
