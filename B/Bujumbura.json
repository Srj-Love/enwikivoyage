It is not advised to walk at night after that; if you need to go anywhere, take a taxi.\n\nTo catch a lift in any type of vehicle from the side of the road, hold out your hand with your palm facing upward.  This works for taxis, buses, motorcycles, and all sorts of private and commercial vehicles.  Mini-bus conductors will honk and use their fingers to show how many seats are available.  If the bus is full, they will wave their hand with their palm facing downward.  It is not uncommon for private vehicles to pick up foreigners requesting lifts during the daytime.  They range from high-end SUVs driven by white-collar workers to flat bed pickup trucks where you must stand up.
