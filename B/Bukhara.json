Bukhara was ruled by a woman, ",{"type":"''","value":["Katun"]},", as regent for her infant son. She had to submit and to pay a tribute of a million dirhams and 4,000 slaves. Permanent Arab control in the city was established by Qotayba b. Moslem Baheli, who after arduous campaigns in Sogdia (87-90\/706-09) overcame the resistance of the Bukharans and their Turkish allies and placed an Arab garrison in the city, forcing every home owner to share his residence with Arabs. In 94\/712-13 he erected the first mosque in Bukhara within the citadel, on the site of a former Buddhist or Zoroastrian temple. In 166\/782, the governor of Khorasan Fażl b.

Bukhara enjoyed a period of prosperity lasting for 150 years and under the patronage of the Samanid amirs served as a cultural center for Arabic learning and Persian literature.

Geographers from the Samanid period mention the division of the city in a citadel (ko­handez), the town proper (sahrestan) and a suburb (rabat). The citadel contained the palace and the original mosque of Qotayba b. Moslem. To its east, dividing it from the sahrestan, was the Rigestan, an open, sandy space, where Amir Naṣr b. Aḥmad (301-33\/914-43) built a palace and where the dīvāns of the administration were situated. In this century, an outer wall with eleven gates was built.

The ʿAbbasids at Baghdad were thus relieved of pressure from the aggressive Saffarids, and the caliph formally appointed Ismail governor of Khorasan, Sistan, Ray, Ṭabarestan, and Isfahan, in addition to his Transoxanian provinces. Samanid amirs were, however, able to retain permanent control of Khorasan and Transoxania only. Although he still officially recognized the caliphs’ overlordship in the Friday sermon and on his coins), Ismail took advantage of his distance from Iraq and his new prestige to function as an independent sovereign. There is no evidence that he ever forwarded regular tribute or taxation to Baghdad. He spent his last years witgh battles against the Zaydi Shiite imams in the Caspian provinces, extending Samanid power westward across northern Persia, and repelling a Turkish invasion from the steppes. Ismail launched an offensive against Ṭabarestan and northern Persia and by 287\/900 held territory as far west as Ray and Qazvin, though again his successors were not able to hold on to these areas.
