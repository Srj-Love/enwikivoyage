It is situated in the Minangkabau highlands, 90 km by road from the West Sumatran capital city of Padang. It is located at 0°18′20″S 100°22′9″E﻿ \/ ﻿0.30556°S 100.36917°E﻿ \/ -0.30556; 100.36917, near the volcanoes Mount Singgalang (inactive) and Mount Marapi (still active). At 930 m above sea level, the city has a cool climate with temperatures between 16.1°-24.9°C\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nThere are some interesting legends surrounding the foundation and naming of “High Hill” Bukittinggi. The city has its origins in five villages which served as the basis for a marketplace. The city was known as Fort de Kock during colonial times in reference to the Dutch outpost established here in 1825 during the Padri War. The fort was founded by Captain Bauer at the top of Jirek hill and later named after the then Lieutenant Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, Hendrik Merkus de Kock. The first road connecting the region with the west coast was built between 1833 and 1841 via the Anai Gorge, easing troop movements, cutting the costs of transportation and providing an economic stimulus for the agricultural economy. In 1856 a teacher-training college (Kweekschool) was founded in the city, the first in Sumatra, as part of a policy to provide educational opportunities to the indigenous population. A rail line connecting the city with Payakumbuh and Padang was constructed between 1891 and 1894. During the Japanese occupation of Indonesia in World War II, the city was the headquarters for the Japanese 25th Army, the force which occupied Sumatra. The headquarters was moved to the city in April 1943 from Singapore, and remained until the Japanese surrender in August 1945.\n\nDuring the Indonesian National Revolution, the city was the headquarters for the Emergency Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PDRI) from December 19, 1948 to July 13, 1949. During the second 'Police Action' Dutch forces invaded and occupied the city on December 22, 1948, having earlier bombed it in preparation. The city was surrendered to Republican officials in December 1949 after the Dutch government recognized Indonesian sovereignty. The city was officially renamed Bukittinggi in 1949, replacing its colonial name. From 1950 until 1957, Bukittinggi was the capital city of a province called Central Sumatra, which encompassed West Sumatra, Riau and Jambi. In February 1958, during a revolt in Sumatra against the Indonesian government, rebels proclaimed the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PRRI) in Bukittinggi. The Indonesian government had recaptured the town by May the same year.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nBukittinggi is located about 2 hours north-east by road from the international airport. The only way to get there is by car. But all the roads are good and smooth.

The approximate price is about IDR 30,000\/person for one way. The vehicle is a Honda Odyssey 2.4 minivan with a capacity of 7 seats.

The trip is very winding and rough, and takes approximately 15 hours.  Be prepared for bus sickness, and to pay around 185,000 IDR (as of 2010).  As the trip is uphill from Danau Toba, the one-way fare is more expensive this way than coming from the south.\n\nNumerous buses go from Medan to Jakarta and stop on the way at Bukittinggi.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nAt BIM(Bandara International Minangkabau)-International Airport of Padang, \nthere's an official desk where you can order a taxi.  The trip price is fixed and you can't bargain.  This is the better and faster way of getting a taxi.  A taxi trip to Bukittinggi is Rp 225,000.

Car's price includes driver, fuel, entry ticket, and parking fee.  Tips aren't compulsory, lunch invitation is more than enough.  For your note, most of the places require ticket and will charge a parking fee. One tour will require about Rp 40,000 only for parking and ticket entry. Another option is hiring a car and arranging with the driver to visit the places in Minangkabau and Lake Maninjau. If you are alone, it is also possible to find guides in the Sianok Canyon park who will take you to Lake Maninjau with a motorbike (ask for Parta e.g., no fixed price, he will take what you give him). In any case, depart earlier, as the tour will take all day.\n\nThe budget option to Maninjau is to take the bus (or minibus) from the bus station (get there from the Bemo station near the market) to Maninjau (35 km, 2hrs by bus, 1h by minibus). Unfortunately, a tourist racket has been set up so you won't get the ticket for the Rp 6000 (Oct 2007) the locals pay. Expect to pay at least Rp.10000 (Oct. 2007). Have the right change ready; don't expect to get any from the conductor. To get back, either try to catch a minibus (Rp 10000) or a big bus (Rp 15000-20000). The big buses you have to catch in the same direction you came, since the narrow road is a one-way for lorries.\n\nThe budget option to Minangkabau is to take the Batu Sangkar public bus for Rp. 7000 (Oct 2007) and hire a motorbike (Rp. 15000 return) from there (or walk the remaining 5 km) to Pagaruyung.

Theres also a museum on the site which houses a few artefacts of little interest - mainly coins and banknotes. Catch the bus from the Aur Kuning bus station, minibuses depart fairly frequently. Expect to pay Rp. 10 000 as a tourist. To get back there is a bus which comes from the opposite direction (or northern hemisphere) at 5 o'clock, or alternatively you can wait at the small roadside cafe right next to the monument where locals will help you flag down a bemo which is destined for Bukittinggi (its quite difficult for non-locals to distinguish between a service bemo and a someones car, but the locals seem to know what is what.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Traditional dances are performed for 90 minutes every day from 9PM-10:30PM.

Some of the shops will allow you to buy in small quantities \"eceran\". Please ask the trader if they allow \"eceran\". For price comparison, if a trader in Pasar Atas (Clock Tower area) sells a cowboy hat for Rupiah 100k as the opening price, you can expect to buy exactly the same item at Pasar Aur Kuning for Rupiah 30k. The price per item may go down further after negotiations. To get to Pasar Aur Kuning, take the red Angkot (minibus) from Pasar Bawah (in front of Pasar Banto). Angkot no. 19 or 13 (Tigo Baleh) charge for Rupiah 2000 one way. Pasar Aur Kuning also houses a bus terminal to various parts of Indonesia.

An average price is about Rp 15,000 per person for one meal.  The food unsold is kept overnight and reheated the next day, so it is not recommended for those who like fresh food.\n\nAfter dark, there are many hawkers near Jam Gadang selling fresh foods such as nasi goreng (fried rice), mie rebus (boiled noddles) Roti Bakar (bun with scrambeled eggs), and martabak mesir (beef pancake).
