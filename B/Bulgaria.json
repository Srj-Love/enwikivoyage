The territory of the country has been continuously inhabited from then on and various peoples and communities have lived on the grounds of present-day Bulgaria. In ancient Greek times the region had numerous towns established in it, with some of them still standing as cities and towns in Bulgaria. In later ages the area of modern Bulgaria was part of the Roman Empire with tree provinces. In the beginning of the Middle Ages some Slavic tribes settled on the Balkans, and in the late 7th century a branch of them merged with the Proto-Bulgarians - a Central Asian tribe coming along with the last waves of the Great Migration - to form the first Bulgarian state on the Balkans.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["First and Second Bulgarian Empires"]},"\nIn succeeding centuries, Bulgarian and the Byzantine Empires dominated South-East Europe, with constant changes in the proportion of power and influence that the empires had in this part of the world. At times the Bulgarians were days away from conquering the cradle of civilization of that period: the Byzantine capital ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Istanbul"],["Constantinople"]]},"; and at times, the Byzantines made fatal blows on the Bulgarian state. During the Middle Ages Bulgaria was the centre of Slavic culture and one of the focal points of Christianity. Religious literature and fine arts were developed in Bulgarian schools and the country was famous for its hand crafts. Bulgaria was the first state to adopt the Cyrillic alphabet (in its primal form) as its own writing system in 886 A.D. The first \"Golden Age\" of Bulgaria lasted from about 811 A.D. to 924 A.D. during the rule of knyaz Boris I and of tzar Simeon the Great, kings of the First Bulgarian Empire. The second Golden Age in the state was from 1200 A.D. to 1241 A.D. in the reign of tzar Ivan Asen II, king of the Second Bulgarian Empire. He was a ruler of the Asenevtsi dynasty, a house that re-established the Bulgarian state after it had fallen from the Byzantine Empire and was \"absent from the map\" for nearly two hundred years until 1185. The rule of Asenevtsi is famous for crushing the crusaders after they gave up on their aim to conquer the holy lands and turned against Orthodox Christianity. Around and after the battle with the crusaders the rulers of the Second Bulgarian Empire had a reign of supremacy in this part of Europe as the state has become the largest and most powerful in \"the neighbourhood\".\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Ottoman Rule"]},"\nBut by the end of the 14th century the region was overrun by the Ottoman Turks. The Bulgarians, along with the other Balkan peoples, became part of the Ottoman Empire. Five centuries later, in 1878, Bulgaria was liberated with extensive help from the Russian Empire as part of their larger fight against the Ottoman Empire. The country's iconic heroes include freedom fighters and intellectuals from the time of the Ottoman rule. Some of the most prominent are: Father Paisiy, Georgi Sava Rakovski - the revolutionary strategist, Vasil Levski - the Apostle of Freedom, and Hristo Botev - poet and fighter. Bulgaria gained its ",{"type":"''","value":["de facto"]}," independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1908.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Third Bulgarian State"]},"\nAfter a series of bloody and brutal Balkan wars and a national catastrophe, Bulgaria had the further misfortune to be occupied by the losing side in both World Wars, and fell within the Soviet sphere of influence during the Cold War. It became a People's Republic in 1946, with the communist party in the leader position. During Communist times, the Black Sea was a favorite destination for travellers behind the Iron Curtain and many of the resorts in the country were built in that era. In the end of 1989 the communist domination was brought to a swift end. Though Bulgaria held multi-party elections, many communist politicians stayed in power with re-branded socialist policies. Hyperinflation and economic meltdown made long retired workers to go begging in the streets to supplement their now-worthless pensions, young people to start shady businesses and the community to look up to leaders of the mafia for help. The situation finally drove the old guard out of power in 1997, but the country was in a tough political situation because of the spread of the influence of the \"underground processes\" in all the levels of the government.\n\nToday, reforms and democratization have brought Bulgaria into the NATO fold, with EU accession celebrated in 2007.  Bulgaria intends to drop its national currency - the lev, and join the Eurozone in 2015, but these plans may be on hold.  Though it has a relatively stable economy and low debt, it is still one of the European Union's poorest members.  For traveller's this means a poor road infrastructure, but fairly cheap meals and hotels if you look around.  Increasing numbers of western Europeans travel throughout the country and many have bought vacation houses near the Black Sea or in picturesque villages.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Holidays"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["The Hanging of Vasil Levski"]},", 19 February\n: The day that the Bulgarian people honour the life and the work of the revolutionary Vasil Levski - the Apostle of Freedom.

You can travel both routes overnight, but you should make your reservations early because these night trains are often fully booked. Also be aware that most Bulgarian train compositions are more than 20 years old and not well maintained.\n\nThe official website of the Bulgarian State Railways ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.bdz.bg\/"]}," is user-friendly and offers an easy-to-use online timetable ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/razpisanie.bdz.bg\/site\/search.jsp"]},". Another train planner is available on ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.bgrazpisanie.com"]}," ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/bgrazpisanie.com"]},".\n\nRecently, new equipment has appeared on some the trains on routes between main destinations. The new trains consists of Desiro Trains from Siemens, which provide a comfort level that is comparable to German local trains (in fact these are the same trains with same seats !). They travel from Sofia to Plovdiv as local trains and to Karlovo and Asenovgrad from Plovdiv, as well as to Blagoevgrad from Sofia and to a few other cities. Anyone looking for a \"real\" train experience should dodge these trains. \nThe other fast and local trains consist of older carriages, partly from older Bulgarian stock, partly old German rolling stock (Interregio coaches). They are sometimes in a good condition (German coaches) and sometimes a bit rundown. Usually the toilets are in a pretty miserable to almost usable state (woman beware !). BDZ has also renovated some older cars and uses them for their premium product now, called IC, which is a fast train with obligatory reservations and 2+1 seating even in 2nd class and pretty comfortable and clean seats. \n\nBuying train tickets is pretty fast forward, though most people will buy a ticket 10 minutes before departure, as your ticket is usually valid for a specific train. If you don't know which train you want to use, you can also buy a ticket in the train without penalty. If your journey starts at the same point as the train starts, you might also be able to buy a reservation for a specific seat on a specific train for very little surcharge (0,30 Leva). Though it never seems to work from stations in between. \n\nAny train fan should also ride the Rhodopes train, which starts at Septemvri and goes up to Dobrinisthe, passing through Bansko. Not even metre-gauge, this small train passes through a very scenic landscape, climbing up the Rhodopes mountains, reaching the top and then going down again in 4,5 hours for 125 km (30 km\/h average speed). It takes a while, but it's a real good experience to see some parts of rural Bulgarian life. \n\nNew rail lines are also under construction but will not operational until 2011. \n\nThird class usually cost about 30% more than 2nd class and is usually not notably more comfortable (3 seats in a row instead of four). If you buy a return ticket, you might get a discount of 30% for the whole journey, compared to buying two separate tickets (don't forget to get the ticket stamped at the station before your return journey, as it might be invalid otherwise).\n\nThere is discount for travelling in group.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\n\nMany taxi drivers know only limited English so it is useful to write out your destination or carry a map. In winter 2008, a few of the newer taxis in Sofia have GPS units on the dashboard. Taxi tariffs in Bulgaria are standardized in the major cities. One should be ",{"type":"'''","value":["extremely careful"]}," about using a taxi in Bulgaria. Especially since you are a foreigner, you can definitely become a target of unscrupulous taxi drivers. When in need, get familiar with the most well known taxi operators in your area, your route and expected bill. Generally the safest way of using a taxi is by ordering a taxi by phone. Some fraudalent taxis even mimic others' logos and labels on their cars. Definitely avoid using taxis waiting at airports and railway stations! An exception represent the Sofia and Varna airports as recently both airports contracted with licensed taxi companies. Currently only these companies can enter the airport area and pickup passengers - prices are standard.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nIf traveling by car, it would be helpful if you can read the Cyrillic alphabet at least a bit. Most signs at the major roads have the direction shown in Latin letters, but the signs in the internal road system are exclusively in Cyrillic, so if you are planning a road trip, GPS navigation or a road map are recommended.\n\nIf you are a foreigner, its best to rent a car. If you decide to rent a car bear in mind that for any bump or scrape to the car, whether involving a third party or not, you must immediately call the police to come and establish the damages of the incident for the insurance companies, otherwise you will find that your insurance will not cover the damage. Check the Terms & Conditions of your rental agreement closely.\n\nDriving in Bulgaria can be a bit precarious - many roads do not have well defined lanes as they are not well marked, and are in poor conditions with bumps and holes on them. On all but the major roads, expect to find significant pot holes and uneven surfaces. Due to the poor road surfaces, you will often find cars driving on the wrong side of the road to avoid these holes, so be cautious when driving around blind bends. Locals often do not observe speed limits, do not signal when changing lanes, take up dangerous manoeuvres on the road and are very nervous on behind the wheel. When travelling on the road Sofia-Greece, be very careful. There are extensive road reconstructions and you can meet some really dangerous drivers.\n\nIf you observe the rules, police will not bother you. Bulgarian police have white Opel Astra patrol cars, marked \"POLICE\" with blue letters - keep that in mind, because in the past there have been several cases of fake police officers stopping cars and robbing travellers. Should you ever doubt the authority stopping you, you have the right to ask them to identify themselves with a certificate issued by the Ministry of Internal Affairs (Министерсво на вътрешните работи - МВР).\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Never ever drink and drive in Bulgaria!"]}," This is always dangerous, and in Bulgaria it is a heavy criminal act: your first offence will result in a long prison sentence or at least - a very significant fee. The once-common practice of bribing a police officer to get out of a speeding or parking ticket is becoming the exception.\n\nCar theft isn't much of a risk, but shouldn't be underestimated. In rural areas leaving your car should be safe, but in the big cities or tourist spots, it is advisable to stay on the safe side by parking either on the major streets or on guarded garages, where fees range from 6 leva (€3) a day to 2 leva (€1) an hour. If you plan to spend more time in one city, it might be better to rent a parking space, which on the average costs 60 leva (€30) a month. Most hotels have their own parking, and even at private lodgings it is often possible to park the car in the garden or so, just ask.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nAir travel is still not very common in Bulgaria as distances are relatively short.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Bulgaria Air"]},", the national carrier travels everyday from Sofia to Varna and Burgas.

Russian and other Slavic languages are more distantly related but still similar. If you know any of these, you shouldn't have much problems getting by. Old Church Slavonic, a very early written form of Bulgarian or Macedonian, is the \"mother language\" of the Slavic group, like Latin is to the Romance languages.\n\nModern Bulgarian is difficult to Westerners, especially English speakers, as it has three genders for nouns, the infinitive of verbs has fallen virtually out of use, and articles are appended to the end of either the noun (if no attribute is present) or the first attribute (example: куче (",{"type":"''","value":["kuche"]},") = dog, кучето (",{"type":"''","value":["kucheto"]},") = the dog, добро куче (",{"type":"''","value":["dobro kuche"]},") = good dog, доброто куче (",{"type":"''","value":["dobroto kuche"]},") = the good dog). However, it is actually easier than the other Slavic tongues as the other Slavs almost never use articles and have noun cases instead of or in addition to prepositions, which makes them more difficult.\n\nIt takes a short while getting used to the Cyrillic alphabet, a writing system of which Bulgarians are proud as Bulgaria is the first country to have adopted the alphabet in the early medieval centuries because of its suitability to the specifics of Slavic sounds. The holiday celebrating the alphabet and Bulgarian education as a whole is one of the most loved and honoured in the country, so be sure to be in Bulgaria for the celebrations on 24 May. The Russian\/East Slavic version of the alphabet is almost identical to the Bulgarian one.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Turkish phrasebook"],["Turkish"]]}," is spoken natively by the Turks of Bulgaria, who live mostly in the Southern mountains and the further Northeast. In some towns of those regions Turkish speakers are the majority. Bulgarian also has loanwords from Turkish.\n\nIt is also important to remember the fact that many Bulgarians - contrary to most nationalities - ",{"type":"'''","value":["shake their head"]}," for ",{"type":"''","value":["Yes"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["nod"]}," for ",{"type":"''","value":["No"]},"!

In larger cities there are a number of language high schools, so if you are in luck you can find people speaking German, French and Spanish. It's best to turn to the young population for a direction or advice if you speak a Western European language. Because of their close connections with the Soviet Union in the past and the similarities in the languages, many older Bulgarians can understand and speak ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russian phrasebook"],["Russian"]]},". However, the use of Russian has been declining since the collapse of the iron curtain, with English now being far more popular among younger people. In the south people often understand Greek and Turkish. In a tourist area it is likely to find somebody who speaks other Slavic languages or German. Also, the widespread use of foreign words have made them incorporated in Bulgarian everyday language. English, Russian, German and other foreign versions of words and commonly used phrases like ",{"type":"''","value":["Thank you"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["Excuse me"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["Hello"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["Goodbye"]}," among others, are widely used in Bulgaria.

This is why in most restaurants a salad is considered to be the best combination for strong alcoholic drinks.\n\nIn recent years, restaurants serving international cuisine have also made a presence in the country, offering various options such as Chinese, French, Italian, and international contemporary.\n\nIt is also worth noting that because of Bulgaria's beneficial geographical location and the slow technological progress in the agricultural sector of the economy the plant products used in the typical Bulgarian kitchen are all organic.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Vegetarian"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Shopska Salad.JPG"],["thumbnail"],["Shopska salad"]]},"\nThere are a number of traditionally vegetarian dishes in Bulgarian cuisine including salads, soups, and some main dishes.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Salads"]}," - main ingredients in Bulgarian salads are tomatoes, cucumbers and white cheese.

The most widely consumed, however, have been pork. Traditional meat appetizers are made from either the meat of the animal or from its intestines, but some of the delicacies include both.

You can find everything - from hostels in Sofia and Plovdiv, very cheap boarding houses along the coast to inexpensive hotels in all cities and luxury hotels in large cities. There are many \"mountain huts\" or villas available for rent all around the mountains in the country. Overnight accommodations can also be acquired at about a dozen of the monasteries. There are also plenty of guest houses and villas. Bulgaria is famous for offering quality budget accommodation for rural and ecological tourism in charming small towns in its mountains as well as at the seaside. \nIn some of the coastal villages, elderly ladies often approach tourists disembarking from coaches and trains, offering accommodation in boarding houses. These can often be excellent value for money (from as little as $5 a night) and can offer an authentic experience, however check these out before you agree on a stay.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Learn"]},"\n\nThe oldest Bulgarian university is the ",{"type":"''","value":["Sofia University \"St. Kliment Ohridski\""]}," that in 2008 celebrated 120 years from its foundation. It is considered to be the largest and most prestigious university center. There are many newer centres of education in Sofia, Plovdiv, Varna, Shumen, Veliko Tarnovo, Blagoevgrad, etc.\n\nFor most subjects, programs are available in Bulgarian or English, depending on the university. Elementary and middle schools are supported by local authorities budget. As with most nations, teachers complain about small salaries. Literacy is nearly universal. Bulgarian people speak mostly English, German, French and Russian.\n\nSome of the universities that offer education entirely in English are the ",{"type":"''","value":["American University in Bulgaria"]},", the ",{"type":"''","value":["New Bulgarian University"]}," and the ",{"type":"''","value":["Technical University of Sofia"]},". The last one offers also degrees in German language.\n\nSecondary education entirely in English is offered by the ",{"type":"''","value":["American College"]}," in Sofia.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nBulgaria is generally a safe country, and people are quite friendly. You should however behave according to common sense when you are outside of the main tourist areas, i.e. don't show too openly that you have money, don't dress too much like a tourist, watch your things, don't walk around the suburbs (esp. those of Sofia) at night, avoid dark streets at night. Stepping in a hole is a much greater danger in Bulgaria than getting robbed.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Emergency phone numbers"]},"\n\nThe pan-European standard number ",{"type":"'''","value":["112"]}," for all emergency calls is working everywhere in Bulgaria since September 2008.

Aggressive driving habits, the lack of safe infrastructure, and a mixture of late model and old model cars on the country’s highways contribute to a high fatality rate for road accidents. Of significant notation that the Bulgarian road system is largely underdeveloped.  There are few sections of limited-access divided highway.  Some roads are in poor repair and full of potholes. The use of seat belts is mandatory in Bulgaria for all passengers, except pregnant women.  In practice, these rules are often not followed. Take caution while crossing the streets, as generally, drivers are extremely impatient and will largely ignore your presence whilst crossing the road.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Crime"]},"\n\nIn general, organised crime is a serious issue throughout Bulgaria, however it usually does not affect tourists and ordinary people. Bulgaria is safer than most European countries with regard to violent crime, and the presence of such groups is slowly declining. Pickpocketing and scams (such as taxi scams or confidence tricks) are present on a wider scale, so be careful, especially in crowded places (such as train stations, urban public transport).\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Car theft"]}," is probably the most serious problem that travellers can encounter. If you drive an expensive car, ",{"type":"'''","value":["do not"]}," leave it in unguarded parking lots or on the streets - these locations  are likely to attract more attention from the criminals. If, by any chance you do leave it in such a location, you need to be sure that the vehicle has a security system. Such an installment will prevent the vehicle from getting stolen.\n\nTravelers should also be cautious about making credit card charges over the Internet to unfamiliar websites.  As recent experiences has shown, offers for merchandise and services may be scam artists posing as legitimate businesses.  A recent example involves Internet credit card payments to alleged tour operators via Bulgaria-based websites.  In several cases, the corresponding businesses did not actually exist. As a general rule, do not purchase items of websites you are unfamiliar with.\n\nBulgaria is still largely a cash economy.  Due to the potential for fraud and other criminal activity, credit cards should be used sparingly and with extreme caution.  Skimming devices, surreptitiously attached to ATMs by criminals, are used to capture cards and PINs for later criminal use, including unauthorized charges or withdrawals, are very common in Bulgaria. If you are unsure which ATM to use, it's best to use your cash instead of a credit card.\n\nAlso, be careful with the cash you are dealing with. Remember that Bulgaria is one of the biggest bases for money forging of foreign currency, so pay attention to your euros, dollars and pounds.\n\nOn occasion, taxi drivers overcharge unwary travelers, particularly at Sofia Airport and the Central Train Station.  Travelers are recommended to use taxis with meters and clearly marked rates displayed on a sticker on the passenger side of the windshield, as generally these Taxi's charge a normal amount, and the taxis with no meters charge for very unfair prices. One useful tip is to check the price for your trip from a trustful source beforehand, such as a friend or an official at station or tourist bureau. If by any chance you are trying to be lured into such rouge taxis, it is best to reject the offer, or just simply walk off.\n\nBulgaria has ",{"type":"'''","value":["very harsh drug laws"]},", and the penalties are perhaps far more severe than in any other country in Europe.\n\nDo not exchange currency on the street! It is a common scam to offer you fake money as exchange in tourist areas such as stations.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Animals"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Stray dogs"]}," are common all over Bulgaria. While most are friendly and are more scared of you than you are scared of them, they have been responsible for a number of accidents, so do keep on guard. There is rabies in Bulgaria, so any animal bites should receive immediate medical attention.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Wild bears"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["wolves"]}," can sometimes be seen in woods, so be careful.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Corruption"]},"\n\nCorruption exists in Bulgaria as in many other European countries. For example, some policemen or officials may request you a bribe for certain action. If this happens, decline the proposal and ask for the name & ID of the individual. Corruption in customs was also once a problem, but has dropped drastically since the country's EU entry.\n\nThe government has fiercely fought the corruption with a huge success. Should you appear in a situation to which you are asked to bribe, or you feel that you are being exploited, you can either fill out an online query with the police here http:\/\/nocorr.mvr.bg\/, or call 02 982 22 22 to report corruption.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Begging"]},"\n\nUnfortunately begging and random people trying to sell you stuff is quite common in Bulgaria. In the holiday resorts both in the mountains and on the coast there will be numerous people trying to sell you various things such as roses and pirate DVD's etc. Usually a firm no will get rid of them but sometimes they will persist and often ignoring it will not make them go away unless you make it absolutely clear you are not interested. Also be aware that in many cases these people can just wander into the hotel restaurants in the evening so expect to see them standing at your table at some point!\nIn the ski resorts there are many people who sell \"Traditional\" Bulgarian bells. They know when tourists arrive and how long they are staying for and will pester you all week to buy a bell. If you make it clear at the start of the week that you do not want a bell they will usually leave you alone (for a few days at least) but if you do not say no, or even say maybe they will tag you with a cheap plastic bell to force you to buy one later in the week. The bell men will suddenly become your friend for the week as they try to get you to buy a bell, but of course if you want to buy a bell make sure you haggle! And if you really don't want to buy a bell, by the end of the week your bell man will demand his cheap plastic bell back and won't be very happy! Don't feel bad about not buying a bell as they often charge extortionate prices unless you really haggle. If you do buy a bell however, you will find that the bell men will be genuinely friendly and  chatty people and really aren't all as bad as they seem!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\n\nAs a generally rich country in Europe, it's best to say that health standards are developed. However, there are potential health risks, even though the government has fought the high chances of such things with a huge success. It best to stay that the greatest risk that a traveller can encounter is ",{"type":"'''","value":["air pollution"]},". People with breathing difficulties, such as asthma are at a greater risk.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Health Risks "]},"\nPollution is no better or worse than in any other European city. Health risks are the same as those in other parts of Europe, so be careful of what you eat, meaning that if you purchase fruits and vegetables, wash them prior to eating. If you are inclined to purchase food from a stand that sells fast food containing meat, know that you are taking on a health risk to yourself, because there are no health codes in those establishments.\n\nIf you are at the Black Sea, mind the strong sun at the beach, especially in July and August. Wear sunscreen and do not leave the umbrella in the first one or two days. Do not drink hard alcohol at the beach, it could give you a heart attack.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Smoking "]},"\nSmoking is the national pastime, and evading the fumes of cigarettes is even more difficult than evading exhaust fumes in the streets. Generally, during the Summer, most people generally sit outside, which makes matters less worse. As this is a seasonally-changing obstacle, it's best to stay on guard. Since 2012, smoking is prohibited in public places, including bars and restaurants, but restrictions are rarely followed.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Eating and drinking"]},"\n\nMost food is quite safe to eat. The products used in cooking are usually domestic and organic. Of course, try to avoid eating at places that are obviously not clean.\n\nTap water in Bulgaria varies greatly in quality, taste and drinking recommendations. While it is of very good quality and safe to drink in the mountain regions, it is best to avoid drinking water in North Bulgaria and in the regions near the seaside. The mountain regions in Bulgaria have natural springs that are quite abundant and many of villages have one or more mineral water springs.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Hospitals"]},"\n\nConditions in Bulgarian hospitals may vary - from the very clean and sparkling, with all the latest technological utilities, to the downright drab, dark and cold. There are some new hospitals, and some very old, with old technology. Medical personnel is very good at their job.\n\nCitizens of the European Union are covered by Bulgaria's National Healthcare System as long as they carry a Eurocard (or European Health Insurance Card), obtainable from their own national healthcare authority.\n\nDental procedures in private clinics in Bulgaria are of excellent quality. Many people from Western Europe come to Bulgaria to have their teeth done for the quarter of the price they pay in their home countries.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Respect"]},"\n\nBulgarians are incredibly friendly and very interested in talking to foreigners. Bulgarians tend to be far more open than some other Eastern Europeans and  engaging in dialogue with these people is much advised and worthwhile. In smaller towns, especially in the Rhodopes, people may invite you for lunch or even to sleep over. Often it is a pleasant gesture to give someone a \"Dobar Den\" when walking past a quiet stall or past a person. Kak sté (how's it going) will usually suffice for the younger generation.\n\nAs a rule of thumb for most countries worldwide, you should avoid topics involving politics and foreign relations, and on some occasions football (soccer) as well. If you are pulled in to such a conversation, try to stay neutral.  Remember that your own knowledge of local situations is unlikely to be as good as a Bulgarian's!\n\nFor certain people, Macedonia is a sensitive subject to talk about, but feel free to ask your questions, provided you do not discuss it with those more likely to take offense (i.e. nationalists and skinheads). Many Bulgarians feel that Macedonia belongs to Bulgaria, but unless you know the subject and the people you are talking to, just asking questions is the best option.\n\nMost of the Bulgarian people do not feel anger or resentment towards Russians (unlike a number of people from other former Eastern Bloc countries), and Bulgarians tend to have a much better perception of Russians, however caution may sometimes be needed  in discussing issues regarding Turkey. Likewise, discrimination against Turks and Roma people can be observed, but it's mostly because of certain nationalist groups, that are not much different than hate groups in central and western Europe.\n\nBulgarians don't really do chit chat, so trying to make conversation with someone at a till in a shop will probably result in odd looks (either from not understanding or not wanting to engage) or they will just ignore you. Likewise Bulgarians are quite impatient and will often honk their car horn at you if you walk in front of a car, especially in winter in the mountains as they try to keep a grip on the road.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Domestic Phones"]},"\n\nDomestic telephone service is available in almost every population centre (no matter the size), via the PSTN or VoIP.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Mobile Phones"]},"\n\nMobile phones are widely spread in Bulgaria - many people have two or three mobile phones using the different carriers. There are three networks (M-tel, Globul and Vivacom), all using the GSM\/3G\/HDSPA standards and are soon to launch LTE(4G) on the territory of the country.\nM-tel is the oldest and largest carrier and as such it has almost full national coverage (97% of the surface of the country), with minore exceptions in the highest parts of the mountains. The other two, Globul and Vivacom, because they are not so heavily used, offer better mobile internet speeds.\n\nFares are average for the European Union (5-40 Eurocent per minute, 7 Eurocent\/SMS). Both pre-paid cards and subscriptions are available, and special options for discounted international calls exist with some pricing plans. Prepaid cards need registration with a valid ID or passport.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Internet Access"]},"\n\nInternet access is widely available in Bulgaria, although about 60% of the population has regular access. Broadband internet is available through cable, ADSL, fiber optics, WiMax and LAN connections. You can also access internet with your mobile phone, via GPRS or 3G. Speeds are pretty fast in the capital - with prices being around 10 € for 20 Mbit\/s, with local access about 40-100 Mbit\/s. The speeds are increasing, home access for 10 Mbit\/s being available at around €7.5 per month. Outside Sofia, speeds are significantly lower, fastest being around 7.5 € for 10 Mbit\/s. Internet cafes are available in most towns and cities, and in some villages. Computers are usually not available in libraries, or in public places such as train stations, but free wireless access is often available in such public places and in gas stations. Many pubs and hotels will also have WiFi that is free of charge to use. In recent years, wireless access has been growing, especially in biggest cities, but is still rather limited. Paid wireless access is also available. Speeds in Bulgaria are surprisingly good!
