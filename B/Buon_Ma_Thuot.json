However, most of this development is from internal investment rather than the tourism industry. There are very few tourist sites, but the people are friendly, the coffee is great, and a stop here is well worth it to get off the beaten track and see Vietnamese city life that does not revolve around tourism.

Fast development and not much tourist infrastructure mean that the guidebooks are behind the times and sorely misleading. A wander just northwest of the main roundabout after around 6PM will turn up a truly great selection of street stalls and small restaurants, offering up very tasty standards such as  hủ tiếu, phở, bún, cơm, and nem.

Buon Ma Thuot is the capital of coffee in Vietnam, a country that is second only to Brazil in coffee exports. Because of this, cafes are on every street corner, and most are spectacular.

Standouts include Emerald's Cafe in Tan Loi and, just east of town,  Trung Nguyen's flagship coffee gardens (a huge pleasure garden complete with man-made mountains and waterfall, lined with coffee trees and boasting both traditional Viet and Ede designed buildings).

They have a couple of nice newer ones with AC (as of Jun 2013). \n\nThere are several Mai Linh buses a day to Dalat (coming from BMT), taking about 5 hours with the last bus leaving in the early afternoon. Buy your ticket (80,000 dong) at the Mai Linh office rather than Daklak Tourist who will ask a much higher price.\n\nIf you want to stay overnight in Lak, Mr Duc (+84 905 371633) from ",{"type":"'''","value":["Café Duc Mai"]},"(dalateasyrider@gmail.com) can arrange homestays in Jun longhouses for US$5, half the price asked by Daklak Tourist. He can also arrange other activities, such as elephant rides and boat trips on the lake, for a much lower price than Daklak Tourist. The café serves an excellent set meal (US$3) for dinner.\n\nTo get to the café, call ahead to get picked up or consider taking a moto (10,000 dong) once you arrive in Lak as it's next to the Jun village and a bit hard to find from the main road. On foot, walk along the main road to the 3-way intersection at the market, then follow the alley going past the market all the way to the end. Turn left, where the road makes a right turn curving around some rice paddies. Follow this road until you see Café Duc Mai on the left side, 50m in front of the Jun village entrance.\n\n-- Understand: Please understand that the people that provide you the service (homestay host, elephant rider, boat rower) get paid very little. For example, Daklak Tourist charges $10 for homestay, Mr. Duc charges $5, and the host only gets $0.50. (I understand that the middlemen have to pay taxes so the price has to be higher). You do need arrangement to be able to sleep in people's houses hear as you're outsiders, but for other services (such as the boat tour of the lake), please consider going directly to the locals. \n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["12.6667"],["108.0500"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Central Highlands (Vietnam)"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Buôn Ma Thuột"]]}]
