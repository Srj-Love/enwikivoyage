It is divided into seven districts, but for this travel guide, it will first be divided it into larger regions, called Northern Burgenland, Mid Burgenland and Southern Burgenland. Those regions have better public transportation within them, as opposed to the very, very poor public transportation from north to south, which is mostly a bus which starts in Eisenstadt (Kismarton) twice a day.\n\nNorthern Burgenland is composed of  ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Neusiedl am See"]]}," (administrative center Neusiedl am See) and Eisenstadt-Umgebung (Eisenstadt). Mid Burgenland is home to Mattersburg and Oberpullendorf, while Southern Burgenland comprises Oberwart, Güssing and Jennersdorf,\n\nThe whole of Burgenland was historically Hungarian territory, but has become part of Austria after World War I. Even today, a substantial Hungarian population lives in Burgenland (Őrvidék in Hungarian), especially in the northeastern parts.\n\nNorthern Burgenland is also the better developed part of the whole, since it is very near to Vienna and could profit from the economical updrift of this region after the World War II. The mid- and southern parts of Burgenland have poor infrastructure and economics.\n\nIn Jennersdorf, you will mostly find completely different weather (sunshine) situations than compared to the rest of Austria (rain).

As a first step, the hog is let out of its cage, then the peasant tries to catch it and set the slaughtering pistol (or sometimes, they use an axe for the same job). You will notice a loud and awful screaming of the hog, until it is caught and shot (or cut). What is called \"dance\" is the running around before it is killed - poor pig.
