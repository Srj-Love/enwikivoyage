Before Meran the administrative centre of the Tyrolean county was in the current small village of Tirol over the town. The name Burgraviate derives from the fact that the district was under control of a burgrave. The Tyrolean rebellion against Napoleon began in the Passeier Valley in the north where Andreas Hofer lived. However, while the rural areas are very catholic and conservative the town of Meran is an international town with Belle Epoque flair and a multicultural life - with the only synagogue in South Tyrol! The current administrative unit was formed in 1971 as an association of municipalities - the capital Meran was included just in 1986. The westernmost part of the Adige Valley located in the Burgraviate is part of the geographical Vinschgau Valley but historically and politically it's part of the district.\n\nThe climate in the Burgraviate is of mild-continental type in the valley (expecially in Meran) and Alpine in the surrounding valleys.

In the valleys no one word in Italian is pronounced by local population. However all road signs are bilingual.\n\nThe Burgravial German dialect (",{"type":"''","value":["Burggräflerisch"]},") has particular features and there is a good literary production with the translation into dialect of ",{"type":"''","value":["The Little Prince"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["Dr kluane Prinz"]},") or the ",{"type":"''","value":["Struwwelpeter"]},".
