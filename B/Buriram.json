It is a fairly nondescript town of around 30,000 people in Thailand's less well visited northeast. While the eponymous happiness is unlikely to be found within the town, Buriram makes a suitable base for exploring the many ancient sandstone Khmer sanctuaries and temples that are scattered around the surrounding area. \n\nThere also are other remnants of the Khmer civilization, including pottery kiln sites, which date back to the 10th-13th centuries, and traces of ancient quarrying.
