Downtown, next to the lake, are many homes owned by middle to upper-class families, as well as many expensive homes from millionaires living in Burlington.

Arterial roads are spaced about 2 kilometres (1.25 miles) apart, and generally run on a 45 degree angle to the compass points. Main roads running northeast to southwest are (from southernmost to northernmost) Lakeshore Road (former Highway 2), New Street, Plains Road\/Fairview Street, the Queen Elizabeth Way\/Highway 403 (a controlled-access highway), Upper Middle Road, and Dundas Street (former Highway 5). Main roads running northwest to southeast are (from easternmost to westernmost) Burloak Drive, Appleby Line, Walkers Line, Guelph Line, Brant Street, King Road, and Waterdown Road.\n\nBurlington is a pedestrian- and cycling-friendly city, although, as the city is somewhat sprawling, walking or cycling is sometimes impractical. There are several long-distance walking and cycling trails in Burlington, including the Waterfront Trail, a 23-kilometre-long paved trail that offers beautiful views of Burlington's waterfront.  In Burlington, you may ride your bicycle on sidewalks, except in the downtown core.\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/cms.burlington.ca\/Page146.aspx Burlington Transit"]}]}," is the transit authority for the city.  Bus service is reasonable for a city of Burlington's size, although not as good as other neighbouring GTA municipalities due to lower population density and higher levels of car ownership.  Most buses run on a 30-minute schedule, although some routes run more frequently during rush hour and\/or less frequently on weekends or evenings.   A variety of discount tickets and passes are available.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Burlington Art Centre"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.burlingtonartcentre.on.ca\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Joseph Brant Museum"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.museumsofburlington.com\/JBMuseum\/JBMuseum.html"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Ireland House"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.museumsofburlington.com\/IHMuseum\/IHMuseum.html"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Royal Botanical Gardens"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.rbg.ca\/"],["email="],["address=680 Plains Rd West"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 905-527-1158"],["tollfree=+1 800-694-4769"],["fax="],["hours="],["price=Adult $12.50, Senior\/Stgudent $10.50, Child $7.50, Family $30.50"],["content=Canada’s largest botanical garden.
