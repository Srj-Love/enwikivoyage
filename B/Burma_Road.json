Not much of the original road survives today, but parts of the route can still be travelled.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThe campaign in China, and therefore the Burma Road, was an important part of the war effort, probably more than most Westerners appreciate. From the viewpoint of Japanese expansionists, taking ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Korea"]]}," in 1910 and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Manchuria"]]}," in 1931 was a great success. However, the Japanese invasion of China in 1937 turned into a major disaster for both sides.\n\nThe Chinese were fighting an invader with far better armament and training, making do with whatever weapons their allies could send (many of them WWI surplus), enduring some spectacularly vicious oppression, and taking enormous numbers of casualties — over ten million military and civilian deaths, far more than any other nation except Russia. Moreover, they were disunited; the Communists and the Nationalists (Kuomintang) were sometimes more interested in their own disputes than in battling Japan.\n\nDespite all that, the Chinese Army (run by the Nationalists with American advisers) managed to give the Japanese a remarkably hard time. Japanese planners thought they could take all of China in three months, leave a small force to hold it, and move most of their armies elsewhere. Actually, it took them three months just to take ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai"]]}," and in eight years of fighting, 1937-1945, they never managed to take more than about half of China. The Chinese Army fought on through the entire war, often retreating but always at a cost to the enemy. Chinese guerrillas and saboteurs — Nationalist, Communist and independent — harassed the Japanese everywhere. Roughly half of the total Japanese ground forces were tied down in China throughout the war, including troops they had planned to use elsewhere. Arguably, every Allied land victory in the Pacific War was partly due to Chinese tenacity and the supplies delivered via the Burma Road.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:African-americans-wwii-009.jpg"],["thumb"],["American trucks on the road"]]},"\nMost of the engineering work on the road during the War was done by the US Army, and most of the trucks were driven by black American soldiers; at the time the US Army did not allow them in combat roles. There was a good deal of fighting in Burma with the Allies battling Japanese forces that held much of Burma and at one point even threatened India. That was a much more international affair; Allied forces included British, Indian, other Commonwealth, American and Chinese troops. Keeping the road open was an important Allied objective. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chittagong"]]}," in what is now ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bangladesh"]]}," was one of the most important Allied bases, since it both had a good harbour and could be reached by rail without leaving British-controlled territory.\n\nThe alternative to the road was \"flying the hump\", which was taking supply planes from air bases in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Assam"]]}," to ones in and around ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kunming"]]}," over a number of mountain ranges east and south of the main Himalayan chain. This was done by American pilots at great risk. Another Allied objective in Burma was to knock out bases used by Japanese fighters harassing the hump flyers. Today \"The Hump\" is a popular tourist bar in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kunming"]]}," and there are commercial flights from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kolkata"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kunming"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" The Burma Road proper "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Workers with hand tools building Burma Road2.jpg"],["thumb"],["Building the road"]]},"\n\nThe actual ",{"type":"'''","value":["Burma Road"]}," was largely built by the Chinese themselves, in 1937 and 1938 — about 200,000 workers with no heavy equipment hacking a road through Western ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yunnan"]]}," and Eastern Burma, from the regional centre ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kunming"]]}," on the Chinese side to the railhead ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lashio"]]}," in Burma (now called ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Myanmar"]]},"). The road is about 1150 km (over 700 miles) long and the area is extremely mountainous and heavily forested, so this was an amazing accomplishment. Starting in 1942, US Army Engineers did considerable work upgrading parts of this road.\n\nThe Burmese part of the Burma Road is short, from the border town ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ruili"]]}," to Lashio, and can be traversed today only one way (Ruili to Lashio) and only under escort.\n\nTravellers on today's ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yunnan tourist trail"]]}," cover some of this route, albeit on far newer and better roads. Traces of the old road, including some milestones, are still visible.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" The Ledo Road "]},"\nAnother road was originally built by the British and Indians, starting in the 1920s, from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ledo"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Assam"]]}," (Eastern India) over the mountains to Lashio. This ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ledo Road"]}," was upgraded and extended by US Army Engineers during the war, and is also called the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Stilwell Road"]}," after American General \"Vinegar Joe\" Stilwell. Total distance on this route from Ledo to Kunming was just over 1,700 km, almost 1,100 miles.\n\nTravelling this road today is nearly impossible. On the Burmese side, the four hundred kilometres between the border with India (near Pangsau Pass) and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Myitkyina"]]}," is off-limits to foreigners. The road itself had mostly returned to the jungle but has been rebuilt, allegedly with forced Naga and Kachin labour, in recent years.
