This Fort and other sites like it would have been inhabitied from around 500 A.D. to 1,500 A.D. in Ireland At the fort they have a 4 part tour. The first part is a display area which gives you some back round information on the Burren and the various sites in the area.The second part is a very nice film which tells you a bit about the Burren and gives you information on the other forts and tombs in the area. The 3rd bit  is a virtual tour. It's a kind of 3D cartoon which shows you what a day was like for the people who lived in the fort - it's only about 7 or 8 minutes long but you understand the whole thing so much better after seeing it.\n\nThe last bit is the tour of the fort itself  - they give you a little map and you can actually walk around the site and see it as it is today. It's interesting to compare with the other forts and having seen the virtual tour it's easy to visualise where everything would have been. If you are in Clare or the Burren go see it - and try the coffee - it makes all the difference to get fresh ground coffee on a cold spring day!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Burrenbeo Trust"],["url=http:\/\/www.burrenbeo.com"],["email="],["address=Main St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Kinvara, Co.Galway"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Visit this information centre on the Burren with lots of free information on the Burren and the environment plus some yummy homemade cakes and coffees!"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["buy"],["name=The Burren Perfumery"],["url=http:\/\/www.burrenperfumery.com"],["email=burrenperfumery@eircom.net"],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+353 65 7089102"],["tollfree="],["fax=+353 65 7089200"],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Monk's Pub"]}," in Ballyvaughan has some very good seafood.
