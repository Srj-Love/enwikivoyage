Burton, an early settler in the area.  The town is a rural, farming, German community with deep heritage.  The town's economy benefited from the extension of the Houston and Texas Central Railway from Brenham to Austin after the Civil War. During the 1880s Burton had three churches, a bank, a school, and a hotel, and by 1885 it had a population of 150. Burton had a population of 800 and thirty businesses by the mid-1940s. During the 1970s, however, the town declined, and its residents had dwindled to 311 by 1990.\n\nBuilt on the traditions of German immigrants, Burton still holds true to its small town values.  You will be hard to find an unfriendly face or an unpleasant greeting.  Although Burton is in the middle of it all - minutes from Washington on the Brazos, a couple hours from The Alamo, an hour and half from the State Capital, and a few hours from the coast - the citizens still keep to a humble small-town life that is rare to find.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nUS Hwy 290 runs straight through Burton.  You can either enter eastbound on 290 coming from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Austin"]]}," or westbound coming from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Houston"]]},".  You may travel down FM 1697 or FM 390 to come in on the Northern side of town.  Both routes offer plenty of historical markers for understanding the historical significance of the area.  If you are traveling by private plane, Brenham has the closest municipal airport, and is approximately 20 miles away.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nAll modes of transportation are accommodated to the streets of Burton.  You can easily get around in a car or bicycle, but it due to its' size walking is a great alternative.  You might even find a group of horseback riders out for a ride.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Texas cotton gin museum 2013.jpg"],["thumb"],["Texas Cotton Gin Museum"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=The Burton Cotton Gin"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address=307 N Main St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +1 979  289-3378"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Began operation in 1914, and still makes a bale of cotton at the annual Cotton Gin Festival"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Burton Train Depot"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address=507 N Railroad St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +1 979  353-0050"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=The location of the train depot where tracks used to run by downtown Burton."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=The Burton Cafe"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address=12513 W Washington St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +1 979  289-2200"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Serves up authentic made from scratch German cuisine, in a small rustic cafe.
