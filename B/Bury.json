It has grown rapidly over the past decades to become the heart of a metropolitan borough. The borough stretches from wealthy ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Prestwich"]]}," and Whitefield (Manchester's suburbia, with thriving, long-established Jewish populations), in the south, past the historically industrial town of Radcliffe to the pleasant small town of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ramsbottom"]]},", in the north, bordering ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rossendale"]]},".\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Castle Armoury Bury - geograph.org.uk - 480345.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Castle Armoury in the centre of Bury is still used by the UK's Territorial Army."]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By tram"]},"\n\nThe 'Metrolink' tram runs every 12mins between Bury and Manchester. During off-peak hours, it's the most efficient method of transport, with the journey lasting approximately 25mins [£4.10 Adult Return \/ £4.90 Adult Day Travelcard].\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nMost bus services to Bury are operated by 'First Manchester'. The [135] bus runs between Manchester Piccadilly and Bury (lasting approximately 50mins), whilst the [471] bus runs from Bolton (lasting approximately 30mins).\n\nA 'System One DaySaver' costs £5 (off peak) and allows you to catch any bus within the Greater Manchester area. This is especially useful if you're travelling from areas other than Manchester.\n\n[The [540] 'National Express' coach service runs once daily from London (via Manchester), but in all honesty, it's much quicker (and cheaper) to travel by tram\/bus once you reach Manchester...unless you REALLY enjoy +6hr coach journeys!]\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nBury lies at the junction of the A56 and A58. From the M60, exit [J17] to join the A56 (Manchester Road\/Bury New Road). From the M66, exit [J2] to join the A58 (Bolton Road).\n\nThere is plenty of parking available in and around Bury. Prices vary, according to the type of parking offered [e.g. private\/council-run\/multi-story\/on-street\/etc] but they are pretty reasonable compared to city prices. Free parking is available for Metrolink users at most stops, so it may be an idea to leave the car and hop-on a tram for the day instead.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nManchester Airport is the closest airport to Bury. You can either take a train from the airport to Manchester Piccadilly train station, or a coach to Manchester coach station. From there, take either the Metrolink or [135] bus to Bury.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By foot"]},"\n\nBeing a small town, most places in Bury are within walking distance (i.e. it will take you less than 20mins to walk from one side of the town to the other).

The most common of these is First Manchester. The different companies have different fares and so if catching more than two buses, a System One Daysaver, allowing use of all buses from all companies within the whole of Greater Manchester can work out to be the most cost-effective way to travel.\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["number 135"]}," bus is the main bus from Bury to Manchester city centre, running at least every 10 minutes. Keep in mind that it will often be crowded with commuters and will also get stuck in the traffic congestion around rush hours, so these times are better avoided. This route is also a night bus service from Manchester city centre on Friday and Saturday nights.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nBoth private-hire taxis and black cabs are available within and around Bury. Private hire taxis cannot be hailed, they must be booked either in person from a taxi rank, or over the phone, or else the car's insurance is void.

Peel Tower is one of the most notable of Bury's monuments, as it resides upon Holcombe Hill, which sits 1100 ft above Ramsbottom. Peel Tower is perfect for fans of walking, and has plenty of footpaths in various locations throughout the Bury district, and since the tower is always in sight on the roads, it makes it an easy place to find. Thankfully, there is a bench on the top of the hill to accompany the tower, for resting. The sights from the hill are astounding, and have to be seen to grasp Bury's true natural beauty.
