At the very centre of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["East Anglia"]]},", the town was established by the Saxons in the 10th century, and its growth was focused around the Abbey of St Edmund. The Abbey grew to become the fourth-largest monastery in Europe and an important site of pilgrimage prior to its dissolution in 1539, since when it became a source of quarry stone for local builders, such that only remnants remain. Today the ruins of the Abbey form part of the Abbey Gardens, a pleasant public park, but the town's Medieval heritage is still visible in much of the street plan of the town centre which has not changed in 1000 years. \n\nThe town developed significantly after the dissolution of the Abbey through wealth from agriculture which has always been abundant in West Suffolk. Most of the buildings in the \"historic core\" of the town are timber-framed Medieval buildings hidden behind brick Georgian fronts, added as symbols of status by wealthy merchants at that time. Some of the grander public buildings - for example the Robert Adam art gallery, built originally as the Corn Exchange, and its Victorian counterpart - reflect directly the agricultural heritage of the area; a heritage which continues to this day with the presence of the Greene King brewery in the centre of the town and a large British Sugar factory on the outskirts. The town has always been famous for its markets - originally a twice-weekly provisions market and a weekly cattle market but now just the provisions market. Bury is also famous for its floral displays, and in recent years has won many awards for these, including the prestigious 'Nations in Bloom' title, contested by towns and cities worldwide. \n\nBecause of its position at the \"crossroads of East Anglia\" (as the town is known), Bury is a popular base for exploring the whole of this region of England. It is not a large town in itself so is easy to explore on a day trip or a relaxing weekend\/short break; however it is within easy range of many interesting locations such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Newmarket (Suffolk)"],["Newmarket"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cambridge (England)"],["Cambridge"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lavenham"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Long Melford"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Norwich"]]}," and the Suffolk and Norfolk coastlines - and so is frequently used as a base for a longer holiday.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\n\nThere are no direct flights to Bury St Edmunds.
