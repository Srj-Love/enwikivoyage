In general, the new companies offer cheaper fares than the two old companies, which were the only operators for most of the country's history. The quality of service of the new companies varies from very good to poor, not only between companies but also between regions of the same company (for example, Connex's service in the Ashdod region is considered very good, but its service in Modi'in gets low marks).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fares and tickets"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Single ride"]},"\nFares are considerably lower than most Western European and North American countries. A single urban ride cost around ₪6.40 in most metropolitan areas, but could be as low as ₪3 in smaller cities. Intercity fares don't follow a nationwide fare system, so you can find significant differences between journeys of similar length. The most expensive journey is between Haifa and Eilat, that cost 80NIS one way.\n\nTickets can be bought from drivers on the bus or at ticket booths in terminals. Offering the exact fare is not necessary, since drivers or cashiers will give change for notes up to 10 times  the fare (so you can use ₪50 note for city rides worth ₪6.40, ₪100 notes for fares over ₪10, ₪200 notes for fares over ₪20). Payment by credit card is accepted at ticket booths for fares over ₪22.\n\nIn general, journeys with connections require separate tickets for each segment - although most metropolitan areas (Haifa, Jerusalem and the entire Tel Aviv area) now feature transfer tickets (",{"type":"''","value":["Kartis Hemshekh"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["Kartis Ma'avar"]},"). The transfer tickets are usually valid from anywhere between one and two hours, depending on the city.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Multiple rides"]},"\nMulti-ride tickets, giving reduction of 15-20%, are available in the form of two-ride (or return) tickets and so-called ",{"type":"''","value":["Kartisiya"]}," for 5 to 20 journeys with the same fare on the same company. These multi-ride tickets can be used by several passengers. Daily passes (",{"type":"''","value":["Hofshi Yomi"]},") are available in some cities, including Tel Aviv, and there is a wide range of monthly passes (",{"type":"''","value":["Hofshi Hodshi"]},") designed for commuters. Recently, Egged and Dan introduced a new ticket for students of unlimited travel for the entire semester or academic year that costs ₪500-1000 (or twice as much for an entire academic year) depending on the zones included in the pass.\n\nReservation is available only for buses to\/from Eilat, and can be done at a ticket booth, by phone or internet or text message.\n\nThe public transport reforms started in \"Gush Dan\" and it includes the Dan, Egged, Metropline and Kavim companies.\nThe area is divided to 3 zones:\n",{"type":"*","value":["Zone 1: Tel Aviv, Ramat Gan, Giv'atayim, Bnei Brak, Holon, Bat Yam, Rishon LeZion, Petah Tikva, Or Yehuda, Kiryat Ono, Giv'at Shmuel, Ganei Tikva, Yahod"]},{"type":"*","value":["Zone 21: Herzliya, Ra'anana, Kfar Saba, Hod HaSharon"]},{"type":"*","value":["Zone 22: Rosh Ha'Ayin"]},"\nZone and inter-zone fares:\n",{"type":"*","value":["A single ticket inside each zone costs ₪6.40 and includes unlimited changes of buses of all participating companies within 90min."]},{"type":"*","value":["A single ticket between 2 zones costs ₪10 and includes unlimited changes of buses of all participating companies within 90min."]},{"type":"*","value":["In a trip from Rosh Ha'Ayin to Petah Tikva the price is like inside one zone."]},"You can use the amount of money that you charge on the Rav-Kav card for all 4 companies, but only on the mentioned areas.\nAs mentioned above, on other parts of the country you still need to separately charge the card for each company (including the companies that participate in this reform).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Rav-Kav "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:מכונת כרטוס בקרון הרכבת הקלה בירושלים.jpg"],["thumb"],["Rav-Kav reader machine, with the Rav-Kav logo"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Rav-Kav"]}," is a smart card, used for payment for public transport in Israel.

The card can be charged at any service point or by the bus driver, there is a 20% discount for each charge (by adding 25% to the amount of money that was charged).\n\nIn most parts of the country the card must be charged separately for each company so a service point or a driver of one company cannot charge the card for another company and the money that you charge for one company cannot be used with a different company. In case of a card problem you must contact the company that issued the card.\n\nThere are 2 types of cards:\n;Unregistered: An anonymous card that can be charged with money or with some special fare products (like a regular multi-ride). This card can be obtained for ₪5 from bus drivers during the ride.\n;Registered: Includes the passenger's details and photo. This type is obligatory for some special fare cards, like the daily and monthly pass or for receiving a youth, student or senior citizen discount. A registered card is insured for loss or theft.

Newer bus stops also have \"bus-stop code\" (5 digits, at the top of the yellow flag).

The list of route no. that stop there are marked on the flag, generally accompanied by the destinations. These signs are usually both in Hebrew and English, but on opposite sides of the sign; if you see it in Hebrew only, check the other side and you'll usually find the English version there.

It is intended to be a source of information that may be hard to find on  official company websites.\n\nCurrently, this section deals mainly with Egged lines; it will expand to include lines of other bus companies as well.\n\nIntercity bus lines are classified to 3 categories: 'Regular' (",{"type":"''","value":["me'asef"]},"), 'Express' (",{"type":"''","value":["express"]},"), and 'Direct' (",{"type":"''","value":["yashir"]},"). \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Me'asef"]}," buses collect passengers at many stops along their route, which makes it a slow journey. (The word ",{"type":"''","value":["me'asef"]}," means ",{"type":"''","value":["collecting"]}," in Hebrew). If you're travelling between major cities, avoid these buses. On the other hand, if you're travelling to a minor destination, this may be your only option.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Express"]}," buses usually travel on long-distance routes; they might use the same route as the ",{"type":"''","value":["me'asef"]}," for certain sections (or even the entire ride), but stop at fewer stations. Express buses normally don't pick up passengers for short journeys on which a me'asef bus line is available.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Direct"]}," lines are either pure non-stop routes, or might have few stops in the cities of departure and arrival. There's no extra charge for faster buses, and in some cases they might even be cheaper than slower buses serving the same terminals.\n\nMost intercity lines originate or end in a central bus station or terminal (CBS\/CBT). The modern central bus stations built in the last 2 decades often combine bus terminal and shopping center in one building. CBS of this type include those of Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Haifa Hof HaCarmel, Rishon LeZion, Ashdod and Rehovot.\n\nBus lines are designated by a 1- to 3-digit number. Urban and suburban lines usually have 1 or 2 digits, while intercity lines normally have 3 digits. There are exceptions, like intercity lines with 2 digits (those might have a preceding 0 to make it 3 digits), or suburban lines with 3 digits (the 1st digit may be 1 or 2, but not higher). The last digit of intercity lines often suggests its category. The fastest routes usually have digit 0 or 5, while the digits 1 and 3 are associated with slow lines. Digits 2, 4, 6 and 9 are usually express lines.\n\nFor example: There are no less than 7 lines connecting Tel Aviv and Beer Sheva. 2 lines are direct: 370 from Tel Aviv CBS and 380 from Tel Aviv 2000 Terminal. 369 and 369א are both express lines, terminating at CBS and 2000 terminal respectively. Lines 351, 353 and 371 are regular (",{"type":"''","value":["me'asef"]},") lines, going in different routes (351 via Rehovot and Sderot, 353 via Yavne and Sderot, and 371 via Rehovot and Kiryat Gat), and should be avoided unless your destination isn't served by a faster line. 369 and 371 travel the same route between Gedera junction and Kama junction, but the former has fewer stops, except in late evening when 371 is not operating, and 369 becomes a regular bus south of Kiryat Mal'akhi (stops north of Kiryat Mal'akhi are served by 301 Tel Aviv-Ashkelon line).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Night buses "]},"\nThere is night bus service in the Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Haifa metropolitan areas. Night buses are operated by the regular bus operators, but have distinct numbers and routes. Operating days are Thursdays' and Saturdays' nights, but expect night-lines to run during holidays (non-sabbatical holidays days and sometimes the night following the sabbitical holidays) and in the summer weekdays as well.  The official night bus website ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.kav-layla.co.il"]}," contains information in Hebrew. Information in English can be found at the Egged and Dan official websites.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Mehadrin lines"]},"\nHaredi, or ",{"type":"''","value":["mehadrin"]}," routes serve centers of Israel's Orthodox population, a portion of which have strict rules limiting contact between men and women. Anyone can take these routes, but you are expected to observe certain rules of conduct. Men and women are segregated, usually men sit in the front half of the bus and women sit in the back half, and go in and out through the back door. If you want to sit mixed, do it in the middle. Women especially should dress conservatively (no bare legs or shoulders, and definitely not bare belly). A court case ruled that these lines were legal, but that the aforementioned rules must be entirely voluntary; despite this, it may not be safe to break them.\n\nAdvantages of these routes are that they go to each city's main religious neighborhoods, not just the central bus station. (This often saves a local bus ride at the end on trip, especially useful very late at night when local buses have stopped running.) Also, they are cheaper than regular buses (due to generally being fuller). A disadvantage is that they often run very infrequently, so check the schedule first. However, they often run at times other buses do not, especially late at night.\n\nThe routes can usually be identified by their endpoints: Har Hotzvim in Jerusalem, and Bnei Brak in the Tel Aviv area, rather than the normal central bus stations.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Amenities"]},"\n\nDue to the relatively short bus journeys, there are no toilets on buses in Israel, and no \"frills\" at all. It's best advised to check in advance for stops along the route, and\/or empty prior to taking the bus. Toilets are available on all central bus stations. Long-distance routes, such as Tel Aviv to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tiberias"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kiryat Shmona"]]}," in the Galilee, make a stop of 10 minutes at designated places, where toilet is available. There are two stops on routes to Eilat.\nHowever, if you are desperate for a bathroom break you can ask the driver and he might let you go at the side of the road (particularly when the next stop is a long way away).\n\nThe driver will often have the radio playing, even late at night. Many drivers object to cell phone conversations being held behind their seats.\n\nIf you want to have the heat or air conditioning adjusted, or have the radio adjusted - just ask the driver. Of course, this goes both ways.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Notes"]},"\nWithout being unduly alarmist, intra-city buses and bus stops have unfortunately been the targets of suicide bombers in the 1990s and early 2000s. If you see anyone acting suspiciously, or discover an unattended parcel, notify the driver, a soldier or police officer immediately. If you can, avoid standing in large crowds of people in order to further minimise any risk. For the last few years, however, the number of suicide attacks on buses has steadily declined, and the last suicide attack on a bus was 2 years ago.\n\n\nIf you're waiting at a bus stop with multiple routes, stick out a hand\/finger (also the Israeli hitchhiking sign) to flag down the driver as the bus approaches. If he or she doesn't realize you're waiting for that particular bus, you may get passed by completely. Do not wave, some drivers think that means you DON'T want that particular bus. If there's a large crowd to get on the bus, don't be afraid to assert yourself firmly (but not impolitely) when people try to push ahead of you.\n\nIf you want the driver to tell you your stop, it is best to be clear about it. If you just tell the driver where you want to go, he may ask you at the following stop why you didn't get off. Also, he might forget, so it is often better to ask the passengers.\n\nWhile Israeli manners may be rougher than in some other countries, they are also more likely to actually help you, with several people debating the best route for you.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Internal"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Jerusalem"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["1"]},": CBS - Malchei Yisrael Street - Meah Shearim Street - Damascus Gate - Kotel (Western Wall) - HaNevi'im Street - Strauss Street - Malchei Yisrael Street - Jerusalem CBS"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["2"]},": Har Nof - Givat Shaul North - Jerusalem CBS - Kiryat Mattersdorf - Kiryat Tzanz - Bar Ilan Street - Shivtei Yisrael Street - Damascus Gate - Kotel (Western Wall)"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["7"]},": Har Chotzvim - Kiryat Tzanz - Kiryat Mattersdorf - CBS Yaffo Street - King George Street - Emek Refaim Street - Ramat Rachel"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["8"]},": CBS - Yirmeyahu Street - Bar Ilan Street - Levi  Eshkol Bld. - Pisgat Ze'ev"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["15"]},": Har Nof - Givat Shaul North - Jerusalem CBS - Malchei Yisrael Street - Meah Shearim Street - Damascus Gate - Yaffo Street - Strauss Street - Malchei Yisrael Street - Jerusalem CBS - Givat Shaul North - Har Nof"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["29"]},": Har HaMenuchot Cemetery - Givat Shaul North - CBS"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["35"]},": Har Nof - Givat Shaul South - Jerusalem CBS - Yaffo Street - Strauss Street - Golda Meir Bld. - Ramot"]},{"type":"===","value":["Tel aviv"]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["dan"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["4, 104, 204"]},"-CBS -allenby-ben yehuda -reading "]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["5"]}," - CBS (4th floor) - Rothschild Boulevard - a square Habima - Dizengoff Street - Sderot Nordau - Terminal 2000"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["18"]}," - Terminal 2000 - Rabin Square - Dizengoff Center - Migdal Shalom - Caramel Market"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["40"]}," Train Western University, Tel Aviv University, Lebanon, Klachkin, Diaspora Museum, Av pharmacist, Shitrit, the Sinai Campaign, Bnei Brak Railway Station, Ayalon Mall, BSR Towers, Jabotinsky, Bursa, Central Railway, Azrieli Mall, Beit Kalka, Beit Ma'ariv, Colonial Square, Jaffa Road, Jerusalem Blvd"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["61"]}," Allenby - Ben Yehuda - Arlozorov Street - Central Train Station - Junction Elite - hakofim Gan - Ordea Square - Beit Tzvi - Ramat Amidar"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["63"]},"Track Summary: Carmelite Terminal, the Caramel Market, Allenby, Opera House, Ben-Yehuda, Bograshov, Dizengoff Center, Cultural Hall, stage, street the Hasmoneans, Beit Kalka, Hashalom Train Station, Rambam, and Weizmann, Katznelson, Jerusalem Blvd, Uziel, Haroeh, the entrance to Tel Hashomer"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["89"]},":Atidim, Deborah, Mishmar Jordan, Marcus Street, Olei HaGardom, Shitrit, Rokach Blvd, Exhibition Grounds, Railway University, Yehudah Hamacabbi, Weizmann, hamedina kikar, King David, Tel Aviv Rabbinate, Tel Aviv Municipality, Garden City, Rabin Square, Ono, Shlomo Carlebach, Cinematheuqe, Tzomet Ma'ariv, the old CBS, CBS"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["161"]}," Allenby - Ben Yehuda - Arlozorov Street - Central Train Station - Junction Elite - hakofim Gan - Ordea Square - Haroeh St. Bnei Brak Municipality - Rabbi Akiva St. - St. Ish hazon - Hotel viznitz - Yaakov kehilot Terminal - Terminal Ramat Amidar"]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["egged"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["271"]},"Haganah Train Station St., Hamasger St., Menachem Begin Road, Azrieli Center, Central Railway, Kibbutzim, at Tel Aviv University\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Intercity"]},"\n\nNote: This listing is incomplete or outdated.
