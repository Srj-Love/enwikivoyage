",{"type":"[[","value":[["Croatia"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Slovenia"]]}," are a bit more expensive than ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Serbia"]]},", but even the longest overnight routes shouldn't cost more than 50 euro.\n\nTickets can be bought on the bus or from ticket booths at bus terminals. Payment is usually done in cash and in the local currency (Serbian dinar, Croatian kuna, Bosnian convertible mark, Macedonian denar or the euro). The euro is legal tender only in Slovenia, Montenegro and Kosovo, but it is sometimes accepted in the other countries as well.\n\nDestinations within the former Yugoslavia are often treated as domestic for the purposes of ticket sales. For example, there is no need to show your passport when buying tickets from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Niš"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zagreb"]]}," or from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Split"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mostar"]]},", but you must show it when buying tickets to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sofia"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bulgaria"]]},".\n\nReturn tickets (",{"type":"''","value":["povratna karta"]},") are available on most lines and give a discount of up to 20%. The return journey must be on the same company, and sometimes a reservation is required before boarding the return bus.\n\nIn ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Croatia"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bosnia and Herzegovina"]]},", access to the platform area at bus stations is usually unrestricted, so it is possible to board any bus with free seats and buy a ticket from the driver. On the other hand, in most ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Serbian"]]}," cities either a valid bus ticket or a so-called \"platform ticket\" (",{"type":"''","value":["peronska karta"]},"), which costs 130 dinara in Belgrade, is required to reach the platform area.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Routes and timetables"]},"\n\nInformation about routes and timetables is available at all bus terminals, usually in the local language. In Serbia and Macedonia it is sometimes printed only in the Cyrillic alphabet. It is also possible to ask for information by phone or at ticket booths, but English isn't well spoken outside the largest cities and major tourist spots.\n\nThe websites of bus stations and bus companies also provide timetables, but these may be slightly out of date, inaccurate or incomplete. The most authoritative bus station websites are those of ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ap-ljubljana.si\/eng\/ Ljubljana"]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.akz.hr\/en.htm Zagreb"]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ak-split.hr Split"]}," and ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.bas.rs\/basweb_eng\/redvoznje.asp Belgrade"]},".

As a result, German-language labels (e.g. ",{"type":"''","value":["Notausstieg"]}," for emergency exit) are commonly seen. There is no legal requirement, but many buses have electronic speed limiters set at either 100 or 105 kilometres per hour.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Notes"]},"\n\nOn longer highway journeys, the bus driver will always make at least one 15 to 20-minute rest stop at a gas station with a cafe and\/or restaurant, public toilet and mini-market. On very long routes like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Split"]]},"-",{"type":"[[","value":[["Belgrade"]]},", there are at least two stops.\n\nWhen crossing borders, either a police officer will board the bus, collect all the passports and review them at their booth, or you will be asked to leave the bus and present your passport yourself.\n\nSmoking is officially banned on all buses, but it is still a relatively common practice among drivers to open their window and light up while driving.\n\nThere is an unregulated but very common practice of sending packages via intercity buses. It is customary to write the intended recipient's name, city and mobile phone number on the package and give a small tip (10 kuna\/100 dinara for shorter routes, 20 kuna\/200 dinara for longer routes) to the driver.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["PartOfTopic"],["Transportation"],["Balkans"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinetopic"]]}]
