[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Buying or renting a vehicle in New Zealand benner.JPG"],["caption=Cars parked in Wellington"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Driving in New Zealand"]]}," is a great activity which, not surprisingly, requires a vehicle. This article discusses some ideas for acquiring a vehicle in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Zealand"]]}," if you don't already have one. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy, rent or buy back?"]},"\nCar rental in NZ is not too expensive, but the general rule is that if your trip is longer than about 8 weeks, it is worth buying instead. Remember that you probably need about a week at either end of your trip for buying and selling. You may also need to pay for insurance (not compulsory but a VERY good idea), AA membership (ditto), vehicle licensing, renewing the vehicle's warrant of fitness  and any necessary repairs. So it can be a gamble to buy.\n\nNew Zealand's population is only 4.5 million and the comings and goings of travellers do affect the market. Good vehicles are pricier and scarcer in October\/November, and cheaper and more available in March\/April, matching when most travellers arrive and leave. Many overseas travellers arrive at AKL and depart from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Christchurch#By_plane"],["CHC"]]}," in the south. This \"direction of flow\" means that you can sometimes make a profit if you buy in the buyer's market of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Christchurch"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nelson (New Zealand)"],["Nelson"]]}," and sell in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Auckland"]]},".\n\nAnother option is to buy a car with a buy back guarantee. This basically means that you buy and own the car but when you have finished your trip you will get a guaranteed price back from the dealer that you bought it from. The percentages vary between companies but it usually is between 40 and 60 per cent depending on the length of time you have the car for. These can work particularly well for people who don't have enough time to sell or don't want to waste their time selling on their holiday.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Tips for renting"]},"\nYou can usually rent a car in New Zealand if:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" You're over 21 years old and the holder of a valid foreign licence (with either an English translation or an international drivers' licence) or, of course a current NZ licence.

Before you do this, remember: New Zealand has an excellent network of inexpensive hostels and campsites, and also one major crime problem: theft from cars. A 'sedan' (saloon) with a secure boot which hides all your possessions will be much safer for your kit. Also be aware that hostel owners don't generally like you sleeping in the car outside and expecting to use the hostel showers etc, as this will overload the place.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Tips for buying"]},"\nThe best tip is to check the vehicle before you buy, for both legal and mechanical problems. A website like ",{"type":"''","value":["carjam"]}," can help you checks the legal history of the vehicle including ownership history, mileage recorded at each warrant of fitness test (to help detect \"wound-back\" odometers), police interest and security interests registered against the car. The mechanical check can be carried out by the AA for a cheaper price if you are a member and is called a pre-purchase inspection. Most reputable mechanics will also perform such checks for you, and they normally cost between 100 and 160 dollars depending on the company and the quality of the check; they should take around 2 hours.\n\nMany of these tips are true regardless of where you are looking to buy a car, but there are a few concerns specific to cars in New Zealand that you should be aware of.\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Because fixing cars is cheap in NZ and it receives lots of Japanese imports, many cars that would be completely uneconomic in Europe are still on the road, sometimes going round and round the country with a succession of backpacker owners.

They do exist but they take some finding."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Don't buy a car you have not test driven yourself for at least around the block.

Cars first registered on or before 31 December 1999 need a WoF inspection every six months. This can cost as little as $30 and, like the MoT in Britain, is not a guarantee of mechanical condition. The only factors that are looked at on a Warrant of Fitness inspection are for the safety of the car, not the engine, gearbox or cooling system (apart from the fact they work and they aren't leaking oil\/fluid), so if you are told \"the car has been mechanically inspected, it has a new WoF\" these are not the same. Nonetheless, try to buy a car with a new WoF."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Do buy a car that can easily and cheaply be fixed; this means a Japanese make and model (Toyota, Mazda, Nissan, Honda, etc) or alternatively a Ford or Holden.

Remember that Auckland has five times as many people as Christchurch."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":[" 'New Zealand New' "]},"\nThis concept needs some explaining. New Zealand imports many Japanese cars; the Japanese roadworthy requirements are so stringent that it may not be worth fixing a car that is only a few years old, so off it goes to NZ. Cars in Japan can have a hard life, so ideally you want a Japanese model car that was either assembled in New Zealand (most were until 1998) or whose only journey in Japan was from the assembly plant to the export ship; not one that was driven for five years around Tokyo first. To tell which is which, look at the dates on the registration sticker; it will show the year of the car and a smaller month and year of when it was first registered in New Zealand. If these are the same, the car is New Zealand new; if not (e.g. '1999 Toyota Corolla' with a date of 11\/05') the car has spent six years in Japan first. Not necessarily a no-go, but be aware.
