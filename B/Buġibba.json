[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Buġibba"]}," is a coastal town on ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Malta"]]},", in the region of St. Paul's Bay which consists of 3 small towns: St. Paul's Bay, Buġibba and Qawra.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nBuġibba, like Sliema, is where you can see the effect of mass-tourism on Malta. It is a coastal town which unfortunately had much of its traditional housing replaced with unregulated buildings such as hotels and prefab rental apartments, it has little accommodation or places to eat particularly worth listing as they're mostly aimed at people coming there on package deals. It has little in the way of attractions or places of interest with the possible exception of St. Paul's Island, its population increases manyfold in the high season.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nBuġibba is well connected to all the major towns in Malta.  Most package holiday providers will provide transfers to Buġibba if you book your hotel there. Getting in by bus is also easy, there are many routes which lead\/pass through Buġibba such as 49, 58, 59 and others.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nThe St. Paul's Bay area is relatively small and is easy to get around on foot.  It's virtually impossible to get lost in Buġibba as most roads lead to the coast.  If you're lost and find yourself in the residential part of Buġibba, the locals are both friendly and approachable and will gladly give you directions.\n\nA well-paved promenade connects Qawra to St. Paul's Bay, going through the centre of Buġibba.  \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nAt the St. Paul's Bay end of the promenade, you'll come to a small but picturesque harbour with some of the traditionally-painted boats.  This harbour also looks out onto St. Paul's Island, where St. Paul was reportedly shipwrecked in the 1st Century A.D.\n\nThere is a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Megalithic temples of Malta"],["megalithic temple"]]}," in the centre of town which is worth visiting. It has a large hotel\/casino built around it. Access can be gained through the hotel or casino lobby (feel free to ask the staff for directions if necessary). The hotel\/casino is located on the sea front in the middle of the block between Triq Il-Merluzz and Triq Ghawdex and access is easiest from the rear of the building.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nBeing more to the northwest than ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Valletta"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sliema"]]}," one has quicker access to northern beaches such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mellieħa"]]},", and the islands ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Comino"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gozo"]]},". Visiting the Red Fort is an option as are the considerably quieter beaches on the north-west coast; Paradise beach (near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ċirkewwa"]]},"), Ghajn Tuffieha and next to it Golden Bay near the calm village of Mġarr (not to be confused with its namesake on Gozo).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\nBuġibba is home to many souvenir shops, from which you can buy towels, beach accessories, handbags, ecc, but there is little in the way of genuine Maltese crafts. For shopping, a visit to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Valletta"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sliema"]]}," is recommended.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nBuġibba boasts many restaurants, but they do tend to cater for the many tourists they receive in the summer months.  You'll find many restaurants around the main square that serve all ranges of cuisine from Italian to McDonalds.  If you're wanting to try authentic Maltese cuisine, InCognito Bar & Restaurant on Fliegu Street may be your only choice. It is about 500 meters northeast of the main square.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nBuġibba offers many pubs serving a range of drinks.  Imported drinks are expensive so, if you're a British tourist expecting a good pint of John Smith's or Worthington's, expect to pay heavily!  Blue Label is a great alternative for bitter drinkers and Hopleaf comes recommended for drinkers of real ale.  For lager drinkers, however, Carlsberg is brewed under licence on the island and is often sold for less than 3 euro per pint but, for a few cents more, you can try Malta's own lager, Cisk.  Wine is of low price and high quality, even in Buġibba, so wine drinkers won't be disappointed.\n\nDon't forget to taste the Maltese soft drink Kinnie which is a bitter orange drink. It's like a Fanta\/Campari mix.\n\nCider is also there ad it tastes amazing, if you are coming to Malta have some Maltese cider. (This text did recently reside under sleep)\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nBuġibba is one of the main tourist areas of Malta and, as such, has many hotels to choose from.  However, as most of the cater for package holidays, you are recommended to book with a travel agent in advance.  A hotel given 4 stars by the Malta Tourist Board is equivalent to a 3-3½ star hotel in most brochures, but these hotels are inexpensive and provide passable amenities and comfort to most tourists.\n\nOne of the few hostels in Malta is located in Buġibba, the \"Lingo Guest House\" with fares starting from €10 per person\/per night in a dormitory.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Euroclub Hotel"],["url=http:\/\/www.euroclubhotelmalta.com"],["email=euroclubhotel@onvol.net"],["address=Fliegu Street, Qawra"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Near the Qawra Bus Terminus"],["phone=+356 2158 1079"],["tollfree="],["fax=+356 2701 1900"],["hours="],["price=from EUR25"],["checkin=14:00"],["checkout=noon"],["content=Three star hotel offering affordable rates, with a lively position amidst shops, restaurants, bars and tourist attractions.

Ask the locals in the main areas such as the Bugibba bay square for the best deals. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\nBuġibba comes alive at night.  There are only a few clubs, located near the main square, for those seeking an active nightlife but, for those wanting a more relaxed holiday, there are plenty of quiet bars where you can have a drink and a chat.  Live entertainment is abundant and most hotels don't mind non-guests coming in to watch.  Karaoke is offered in some bars along Tourist Street (Triq it-Turisti on Maltese street signs) for those with less inhibitions than singing talent.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["35.9500"],["14.4167"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Malta Island"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Buġibba"]]}]
