Bydgoszcz is the seat of Casimir the Great University, University of Technology and Life Sciences and a conservatory as well as a Collegium Medicum of Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń.

The city increasingly saw an influx of Jewish population after that date. In the 15th-16th centuries Bydgoszcz was a significant site for wheat trading.\n\nIn 1772  it was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in the First Partition of Poland and incorporated into the Netze District as Bromberg and, later, West Prussia. During this time, a canal was built from Bromberg to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nakło"]]},". \n\nIn 1807, after the defeat of Prussia by Napoleon, and the signing of the Treaty of Tilsit, Bromberg became part of the Duchy of Warsaw. In 1815 it returned to Prussian rule as part of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Poznań (the Province of Posen after 1848) and the capital of the Bromberg region. After 1871 the city was part of the German Empire. After World War I and the Great Poland Uprising, Bromberg was assigned to Poland in 1919. In 1938 it was made part of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pomeranian Voivodeship"]]},".\n\nFrom 1939-45 during World War II, Bydgoszcz was retaken by Nazi Germany, in the Invasion of Poland and annexed to the ",{"type":"''","value":["Reichsgau Wartheland"]},". On September 3, 1939, shortly after the war started, the Bromberg Bloody Sunday incident occurred in which numerous Germans and Poles were killed; the incident was used in Nazi propaganda and reprisals against the Poles followed after Bydgoszcz was occupied by the Wehrmacht on September 9. The city's Jewish citizens were repressed and thousands of people were sent to concentration camps and\/or executed. \n\nIn 1945 Bydgoszcz was retaken by the Soviet army.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["People"]},"\nPeople of Bydgoszcz were usually born there, as it is not a popular destination when moving from town to town, nor it is chosen frequently by students. \n\nInhabitants of the city are generally very friendly towards tourists and foreigners.

Menus at restaurants are usually monolingual, though it has changed a lot during last few years among bigger ones. At all times you should remember to talk slower and more carefully than you would in your native country. Also, learn how to pronounce the names of places.\n\nMost of the young people and teenagers know English well enough. When asking for directions, your best aim would be a person in their twenties.
