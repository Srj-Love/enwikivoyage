The transcription of the name has changed: Bedesc in 1120, Bidisco in 1122 Bedensi in 1152, Bédec in 1187 and Bédiscum in 1330. It is from the XVth century that the name of Bédée appeared in its actual writing.\nIt can be mentioned that there is a character named Bède the vulnerable, a monk living in England during the VIIIth century. This rare name looks curiously like Bédée. Some Anglo-Saxon monks colonised ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brittany"]]}," in a distant past and left their name: Saint Méen, Saint Malo, etc. Searches in that direction could enable to consolidate this hypothesis.",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\n\nDuring Prehistory, humans lived on the actual territory of Bédée. Indeed, prehistorical tools have been found (ex: polished axe) in villages such as la Morinais, la Rioulais and la Motte Besnard.

They were the first castles, built in wood and on hights, on mounds of earth. One of these feudal mottes can be found at the entrance of the town; it is the motte Jubin. In 1122, Donoald, the bishop of Aleth gave the monks of Saint-Melaine de Rennes abbey the priory of Bédée which became then a parish. But it has been politically taken in charge by the Lord of Montfort-sur-Meu who took taxes and who did justice.",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\n\nThe Lord Charles de Botherel, adviser in the Parliament of Brittany, proclaimed the town of Bédée independent in 1715. In 1744, he became Lord of Bédée. To show its prosperity, the town of Bédée knew a strong development of manors and castles at this time (The manor of the Blavon, destroyed in 1930).",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\n\nThe population of the town is in favour of the changes brought by the French Revolution, above all after the end of the reign of the Terror.
