You will also be required to fill out an Immigration Arrival\/Departer card which you will keep until leaving the island.\n\nThere are busses that run to the hotels along the beach, and you can also take a taxi or rent a car to get you where you need to go.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nYou shouldn't need to get around much unless you are going to a nearby hotel's casino. If you're too lazy to walk, then drive. There is also scooter rental available which is a fun way to get around and enjoy the beautiful weather at the same time.\n\nTo get around, scooter services are very popular in The Bahamas.  If you would like to rent your own car or need a taxi or bus service, the hotel at which you stay at will give you the information you will need to get around the beach safely.  However, mostly at your hotel will be everything you need and want and traveling is not necessary.  If you need to get to casinos, they are in a fair walking distance, but if you would like to go to Paradise Island, a taxi or car is needed.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThe Bahamas itself is something to see.  In the morning the sun rising on the turquoise blue waters is perfect and breath taking, as is the sun set.  You will want to walk along the beach and put your toes in the white sands. Views to see historically include the Queen's Staircases in Nassau along with the government house.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nMost people just come to relax on the beaches.

Also offered at most resorts are rock climbing, trapeze, and other activities.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nMost hotels have at least a small souvenir shop. However, much of the merchandise is overpriced. If you're looking for a bit of a bargain and are not feeling going to the Straw Market in Nassau, there is a little straw market located on the other side of the strip. It doesn't have as much variety as the one in downtown Nassau, but it is something nice to do to and you can find nice cheap gifts. Further located in Cable beach are more shopping plazas with liquor stores, some clothing shops and fast food restaurant.\n\nAlso, along the beaches, there are people selling cigars, shirts, and jewelery which are very authentic and unique in the Bahamas.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nMost hotels along the beach have numerous restaurants.
