The ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.caesarea.org.il\/ Caesarea Edmond Benjamin de Rothschild Development Corporation"]}," (called in Hebrew החברה לפיתוח קיסריה אדמונד בנימין דה רוטשילד) remains the operational arm of the Caesarea Edmond Benjamin de Rothschild Foundation.\n\nCaesarea is therefore the only locality in Israel which is managed by a private organization (the Caesarea Development Corporation), rather than a municipal governmental organization. Caesarea is considered one of the most upscale residential developments in Israel. The current Baron de Rothschild still maintains a home in Caesarea, as do many other wealthy and influential individuals and foreign residents.\n\nBeyond the ancient remains, Caesarea is a town devoted to tourists and to luxurious living. Some of Israel’s finest homes are located here and it is also home of Israel’s only 18-hole golf course (designed by the renowned Robert Trent-Jones), a luxury hotel, a vacation village, miles of sandy beaches, and a series of attractive restaurants, galleries and boutiques huddled around the Mediterranean cove. And, of course, visitors marvel at its extraordinary archeological attractions, not least of which is the Roman theatre, where concerts, entertainment extravaganzas and the annual International Opera Festival are held.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nCaesarea National Park is on the coastal road, near the city of Caesarea and Kibbutz Sdot Yam and west of Or Akiva.
