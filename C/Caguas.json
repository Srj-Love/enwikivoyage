You will have to take a bus to Rio Piedras (the main bus terminal) then take walk several minutes to find the ",{"type":"''","value":["guagua"]}," for Caguas.  It is a very inexpensive way to travel, but can take up to 3 hours.\n\nWithin Caguas, there are several buses and taxis serving the town.  Make sure to ask the driver before you go in for your destination.\n\nThere will be a light-rail system connecting Caguas to San Juan.  It was originally scheduled to start construction in the first quarter of 2008 and take two years to complete.  As of the first quarter of 2010, the project has not commenced.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Plaza Palmer"]}," in the centre of the old section of town, is the main point from where to explore Caguas.

The waiters wear authentic-looking uniforms, and the atmosphere is upbeat.  Entrees average $10-18.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nThe Four Points Sheraton hotel, conveniently located from the highway south of Caguas, has a nice pool area with slide and fountains for the kids, a hot tub, a nice restaurant that looks out onto the pool, a workout room, very comfortable accommodations, and excellent service.  However, it is co-located with a small casino run by the same company and sharing the same parking lot.  Parking is $9\/night (as of January, 2010), even for hotel guests.  Much of the property is well-built; the parking garage has a glass elevator, there are colored accent lights, a glassed-in walkway that goes by a large outdoor fountain, etc.  However, as is common in Caribbean countries, all of it has a soon-to-be-run-down feeling about it.  (BEWARE: Most online mapping tools will place the Four Points' address, \"500 Alhambra En Granada Boulevard,\" a few miles north of where it actually is.  Follow the directions on their website instead.)\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Caguas, Puerto Rico"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["18.231389"],["-66.039444"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["La Montaña"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]}]
