The slower ferries are not necessarily much cheaper, but are far more interesting if you have the time and the weather is bearable.\n\nThe basic route is around the top of Ban Sen island, south along Cao Lo island to Quan Lạn island. The main port of Quan Lạn is at the northernmost tip of the island, and is also the first one you reach (an hour by fast boat, around two and a half by slow boat). A second port of some small-scale industrial purpose lies about half-way down the island on the western side, though the ferry may first visit some minor points of habitation (no roads, shops, hotels, etc. at any of them) on the opposite ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ban Sen"]]}," island before kicking you off here.
