It is a charming and quite peaceful city.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nCalabar is one of the oldest trading centers in Nigeria. The city is set on a natural hill overlooking the Calabar River. Calabar was established as a center of slave trade by the British in 17th century. It became the biggest colonial administration in Nigeria in the 18th, 19th and early part of the 20th centuries. At the end of slave Trade, the city was a major port for Palm Oil trade and commodities exports and imports from the South East of Nigeria. It became the Capital of Niger Coast Protectorate and later the Southern Protectorate capital of Nigeria. Currently, Calabar is the Capital of Cross River State of Nigeria. The city is a major center of tourism in Nigeria. The Calabar Carnival is the largest street cultural festival in Africa. The Carnival holds in December of every year and attracts thousands of visitors and guests from all parts of the world.\n\nLike other major cities in Nigeria, power supply could be a major problem. The Federal Government of Nigeria is currently developing a major plant near the city to boost domestic and industrial power supply. Water is easily available in the city and it is of very good quality. Other attractions include the Slave Museum, Calabar Free Trade Zone, Tinapa Business and Tourist Resort, Cultural and Civic Center, Calabar Port and University Campuses amongst others. The city is a few hours drive to the Obudu Ranch Resort which had hosted many Presidential Retreats and conferences in the past. There is an airport which has connecting flights to other major cities in Nigeria.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nCalabar is about 1 hour from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lagos"]]}," by plane.\nCalabar is about 25 minutes from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Port Harcourt"]]}," and has an International Airport - ",{"type":"'''","value":["Margaret Ekpo International Airport"]},".\n\nCalabar is 1 hour flight from Lagos and a 4 hour drive from Port Harcourt.  With the development of the city by the present administration, the city flight schedules have increased and you can now get a flight in or out of Calabar every day.

Local taxis are not advisable as the cars are very old and quite often the drivers are not particularly experienced.
