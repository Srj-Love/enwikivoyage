It's considered the Caribbean of Europe thanks to its pristine beaches, stunning landscape, and rustic charms.  Hillside towns, ancient Greek temples and Byzantine churches dot the countryside of Italy's best kept secret.\n\nThe region's climate is mild in the winter, with hot, dry summers.  The region is surrounded on three sides by the Mediterranean Sea:  the Ionian Sea is to the east, the Tyhrrenean to the west and the Strait of Messina to the south.  As such, the sea is a big part of the region's culture and cuisine.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Regions"]},"\nCalabria is subdivided into five provinces: ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Catanzaro"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cosenza"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Crotone"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Reggio di Calabria"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vibo Valentia"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Badolato"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Camigliatello"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Isca Marina"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Praia a Mare"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Reggio di Calabria"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Roccella Ionica"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Santa Maria Del Cedro"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sant' Andrea Apostolo dello Jonio"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Scalea"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Trebisacce"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tropea"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vibo Valentia"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nCalabria has historically been one of the poorest regions in Italy, although it is improving now.

The off coast Dino Island is popular for its Grotta Azzurra (Blue Cave), where you can swim surrounded by fish in crystal blue water.\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nIf there is a fundamental ingredient to Calabrese cooking, it would be the peperoncino.  Calabrese cooking tends toward the spicy thanks to the generous use of various varieties of hot peppers in regional cuisine.  In fact, so popular is the peperoncino, that the village of Diamante honors the hot pepper with its own festival.  In the first week of September the locals celebrate the Festival del Peperoncino, dedicated to the unofficial symbol of Calabria -- the cayenne pepper.  During the festival, one can taste freshly harvested peppers or try locally-produced products that make use of the spicy condiment -- anything from pasta to (yes) gelato.  Olio Santo, olive oil infused with hot pepper, is sometimes added to a plate of pasta to give it a little extra zip.\n\nSoppressata (Sopresatta) is a popular dried sausage typical of the region.\n\nAlici ripieni, stuffed anchovies, is a popular seafood dish.\n\nSardella is produced in some of the towns along the Ionian coast in the province of Cosenza.  It is a spicy paste made with olive oil, mashed baby sardines and hot pepper.\n\nSome Neapolitan specialties such as Braciole ('Raciol in Calabrese dialect) are common in the region.\n\nIn summer many dishes are prepared with eggplants.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nCalabria is an up-and-coming producer of wines, with a number of regional wines earning the Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) label from the Italian government.
