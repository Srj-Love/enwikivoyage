One day in 1484, while traveling from Óbidos to Batalha, she found a group of peasants bathing in foul-smelling waters by the roadside. She stopped to inquire about this oddity and was told that the waters possessed curative powers. She decided to try them for herself. She was pleased to find that she was quickly relieved of some affliction she had been suffering (exactly what is not known). On that site, the queen ordered a thermal hospital built so that others may enjoy the relief that she felt. The spa hospital still stands to serve those with certain medical conditions.\n\nCaldas da Rainha is an artistic city. You can find works of art throughout the city, and not just in its several museums. Sculptures serve as centerpieces to most of the city's traffic circles. Caldas's main park contains many statues and sculptures. The city is home to a college of art and design, as well as a vocational school devoted to ceramics.
