As of March 2014, the only changes visitors are likely to notice are the closure of the Inglewood Bird Sanctuary (accessible only by daily guided tours throughout 2014, but the Nature Centre is fully open), interruption of canoeing\/kayaking on the Harvie Passage section of the Bow River,  and roughly 36 km of bike paths that are closed as a result of flood damage and detours.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Understand "]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Road development "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Cgy saddledome.jpg"],["thumb"],["320px"],["right"],["Saddledome and Calgary skyline at night"]]},"\nCalgary is divided into four quadrants: Northeast (NE), Northwest (NW), Southeast (SE) and Southwest (SW). The dividing line between east and west is Centre Street in the north, and roughly Macleod Trail in the south. The dividing line between north and south is generally the Bow River in the west, and Centre Avenue and Memorial Drive (from 36 Street) in the east. Addresses proceed outwards from the centre of the city; for example, 219 16th Avenue NE is on 16th Avenue N, between 1st and 2nd Street E.\n\nDeerfoot Trail (Highway 2) running north-south is one of two freeways in Calgary. The other is Stoney Trail (Highway 201), which presently runs in an elongated horseshoe shape across the northwest, north, and eastern sides of the city. (It will eventually be a complete ring road.) Certain other roads have sections that alternate between being a true freeway and an at-grade expressway, with plans to become full freeways.\n\nAlmost all roads in Calgary's downtown core are one-way; pay careful attention when planning routes in downtown Calgary so that you don't plan to go the wrong way down a one-way street. Stephen Avenue Walk (8th Ave S between 1 St SE and 4 St SW) is closed to all vehicle traffic between 6AM and 6PM daily; after 6PM, it is a two-way street with one lane in each direction. 7th Ave S in the downtown core is for buses and C-Trains only; driving your car on 7th Ave may lead to a ticket, and will certainly lead to glares from commuters.\n\nMajor roads in the city are often given names ending in ",{"type":"''","value":["Trail"]}," (abbreviated ",{"type":"''","value":["Tr"]},"), such as Glenmore Trail, Crowchild Trail, Macleod Trail, and Bow Trail; some of these roads are expressways for most or all of their length. Roads named ",{"type":"''","value":["Boulevard"]}," (e.g. Beddington Boulevard) or ",{"type":"''","value":["Drive"]}," (e.g. Memorial Drive) are generally the next most major classification. ",{"type":"''","value":["Avenue"]},"s (e.g. 5th Avenue) run east-west, and ",{"type":"''","value":["Street"]},"s (e.g. 14th Street) run north-south.\n\nThe names of small suburban roads usually incorporate the community name at the start of the names of all roads in that community. This means that ",{"type":"''","value":["Taralake Garden"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["Taralea Place"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["Taralea Bay"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["Taralea Way"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["Taralea Green"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["Taralea Circle"]},", and ",{"type":"''","value":["Taralea Crescent"]}," are all separate roads,  in the same community – Taradale. It can be very confusing for tourists and locals alike to navigate an area where very small differences in street names are so important to finding your way.  If travelling in the suburban communities, have a map or directions and pay attention to the full, exact name.\n\nCalgary has a fairly dense downtown, ringed by inner city neighbourhoods laid out on a grid pattern for roughly 30-40 blocks. These inner city districts often have unique characteristics and are worth wandering through, for the visitor with some time to spend in the city. The outer suburbs are a typical sprawl of uniform housing and, except for major shopping, parks and other facilities scattered around, have little interest for the typical visitor.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Neighbourhoods of Interest "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Calgary travel map overview of the city.png"],["thumb"],["500px"],["The main transit routes and attractions of Calgary"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["The Beltline and 17th Avenue"]},": 17th Avenue S.W. is Calgary's première place to see and be seen. It boasts a large and eclectic variety of restaurants, unique shops, boutiques, and bars. This street is where Calgary parties, most notably becoming the \"Red Mile\" during the 2004 Stanley Cup (hockey) playoffs, where up to 100,000 cheering fans gathered to celebrate victories by the hometown Flames (the nickname has remained). While the entirety of the Beltline spans from the Stampede Grounds and Victoria Park on the east to Mount Royal on the west, the dense nightlife on 17th Avenue starts at about 2nd Street SW and goes to 15th Street SW.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Bridgeland"]}," (Edmonton Trail on the west, Tom Campbell's Hill on the east, Bridge Crescent NE on the north, and the Bow River\/Memorial Drive\/Zoo on the south) is an urban revitalization area northeast of the downtown. Although the community has long been Calgary's \"Little Italy\" (hence the abundance of Italian restaurants in the area), the demolition of the old General Hospital in 1998 sparked a long-term project redevelop much of the era. The area is expected to be a family orientated Pearl District (see Portland Oregon) and the initial phases are already done. The area includes posh shops, chic apartments, beautiful lofts, while maintaining the old charm of the distinct houses. Eventually the neighbourhood will have more shops, and some high rise buildings. It is a great area to walk through for those interested in architecture\/planning. The far eastern end of Bridgeland connects with the Calgary Zoo and the newly opened TELUS Spark science centre.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Inglewood"]},": Inglewood is Calgary's oldest neighbourhood and the site of the city's original downtown. It is also one of Calgary's most culturally influenced and eclectic areas. Inglewood contains everything from stores targeted at bikers, to unique boutiques, antique stores, galleries, and restaurants. It is not as developed as some of the city's downtown districts, but it is quickly becoming one of the city's most popular \"urban chic\" neighbourhoods. It lies immediately east of downtown (east of 1st Street E) and is concentrated along 9th Avenue SE. Just to the north is the Bow River and the world-famous Calgary Zoo.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.internationalavenue.ca\/ Forest Lawn International Avenue"]}]},". Forest Lawn is known for its diverse culture, with the city's best Vietnamese, Lebanese, and Central American eateries lining 17th Avenue SE between 26th St SE and 61 St SE. The nightlife of this area is a place to exercise caution. There are many pawn shops that line the streets, if you're looking for a deal.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.visitkensington.com\/ Kensington"]}]},". Kensington is located along the Bow River on the north side of downtown. It is another one of Calgary's notable shopping neighbourhoods, with a somewhat more bohemian feel than 17th Avenue (one particular store specializes Birkenstocks and futons). It offers a good variety of restaurants, with more of an emphasis on coffee shops than on bars. Kensington runs along Kensington Road NW from 14th St NW to 10th St NW, and also north along 10th St NW to 5 Ave NW.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["McKenzie Towne"]}," is located on the southeastern outskirts of Calgary (accessible via Deerfoot Trail and McKenzie Towne Boulevard). An exception to the \"dull suburb\" stereotype, this planned community features parks and classical home facades that come right out of a Norman Rockwell painting. Anchoring the area is High Street, a shopping centre disguised as a classic small-town main street. Worth checking out if you've rented a car to visit Spruce Meadows.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Marda Loop"]},"\/",{"type":"'''","value":["Garrison Green"]}," (east of Crowchild Trail along 33rd Avenue SW), which contains a large number of quaint shops, restaurants, and services and is a real up and comer area and would be a great place to check out. Marda Loop, centred on the intersection of 33rd Avenue and 20th Street S.W., is the older of the two areas and in mid-August hosts the Marda Gras Street Festival along 33 Avenue between 19 St. and 23 St. S.W. Garrison Green is a newly developed residential\/shopping district immediately to the south of 32 Avenue that features its own mix of eclectic shops and old-towne storefronts.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Mission"]},": The Mission district was established as a French & Catholic settlement (later called Rouleauville) at the same time that Calgary was founded. Historic displays at ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.calgary.ca\/CSPS\/Parks\/Pages\/Locations\/Downtown-parks\/Rouleauville-Square.aspx Rouleauville Square"]}," and the Elbow River Promenade tell the story of the area. In many ways, Mission acts as an extension of 17th Avenue. Like the Beltline, it is packed full of interesting restaurants and shops. It does not share 17th Avenue's \"late night\" reputation, however and it generally lacks the bars and nightclubs. Mission extends from 4th Street SW to 1st Street SE and from 17th Avenue SW in the north to 26th Avenue and the Elbow River in the south.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Mount Royal"]}," is a neighbourhood south of the downtown with charming old homes that doesn't conform to the old street grid that was used back then. The area houses some of Calgary's elite. It is a nice area to do a quiet nice stroll through, admiring old residences. Driving around the community can be challenging due to the preponderance of \"traffic calming\" and street closures to prevent cut-through traffic.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Parkhill"]}," is a neighbourhood south of downtown. It is a quite wealthy area that was once home to many old homes. Today it is home to a range of modern designs, with few old homes still standing. It's a very interesting neighbourhood to go to.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" History "]},"\nCalgary was founded by the Northwest Mounted Police (NWMP) in 1875 and was originally called Fort Brisebois. (The name was changed to Fort Calgary in 1876, named after ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Calgary (Scotland)"],["Calgary Bay"]]}," on the Isle of Mull). The NWMP was sent west to ensure that Canada would not have an American-style \"Wild West\". Grave concerns about this were raised after the Cypress Hills Massacre of natives by drunken wolf hunters in 1873. Calgary was one of several forts established in Western Canada by the NWMP to ensure a police presence before the arrival of settlers.\n\nIn 1883, the railway reached Calgary. It started to grow in every direction and became an agricultural and business hub. In 1884, Calgary was incorporated as a town in what was then the North West Territories. By 1894, Calgary's population had grown to 3900 people and it was incorporated as a city. Alberta's first major oil & natural gas field was discovered in 1914 at Turner Valley ",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Turner Valley, Alberta"]]},", 60 km south of Calgary. Subsequent discoveries kept the oil & gas scene active in the Turner Valley area for the next 30 years. When the Turner Valley fields were depleted, the next major oil & gas find was at Leduc (near Edmonton)in 1947. By then, Calgary was already established as a centre of oil & gas business. During the 1950s, oil became big in Calgary and major American oil companies started heading to Calgary and opening offices. The boom extended into the next twenty years, bringing the city to 720,000 people in the metro area by 1985. The relatively low-key low-rise downtown became filled with a sea of skyscrapers, starting with the Calgary Tower and some other towers in the 1960s. By the 1980s, Calgary's luck turned, and a drop in oil prices sent the Calgary metro economy downward. High unemployment raged, vacancies became a reality,and growth was slow or even negative in some years. In 1988, Calgary hosted the Winter Olympics and brought world attention to Calgary. By the 1990s, it was on the rebound and began growing again. Calgary today has become a more cosmopolitan city of over one million inhabitants with genuine attempts to diversify its economy and expand its attractiveness to outside visitors.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Climate "]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh = -3"],["febhigh = 0"],["marhigh = 4"],["aprhigh = 11"],["mayhigh = 16"],["junhigh = 20"],["julhigh = 23"],["aughigh = 23"],["sephigh = 18"],["octhigh = 12"],["novhigh = 3"],["dechigh = -1"],["janlow = -15"],["feblow = -12"],["marlow = -8"],["aprlow = -2"],["maylow = 3"],["junlow = 7"],["jullow = 9"],["auglow = 9"],["seplow = 4"],["octlow = -1"],["novlow = -9"],["declow = -13"],["janprecip = 12"],["febprecip = 9"],["marprecip = 17"],["aprprecip = 24"],["mayprecip = 60"],["junprecip = 80"],["julprecip = 68"],["augprecip = 59"],["sepprecip = 46"],["octprecip = 14"],["novprecip = 12"],["decprecip = 12"],["description = See the Calgary 7 day forecast at ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.weatheroffice.gc.ca\/city\/pages\/ab-52_metric_e.html Environment Canada"]}]]},"\nCalgary is sunny and rather dry, with wide seasonal and daily temperature ranges. Summers tend to be sunny and mild, averaging highs of about 23°C (73°F) in July\/August, usually accompanied by short afternoon storms – June being typically the wettest month. Hot weather (greater than 30°C \/ 86°F) is rare, occurring on average five times a year. Also temperatures typically drop dramatically during rain days as well; there's always a couple days in the summer months that barely manage highs over 10°C (50°F)).\n\nWinter can also vary quite a bit. Temperatures can get extremely cold (below -20°C \/ -4°F) at times between November and March, while -30°C (-22°F) is possible (on average five times a year). Though average highs in January are about -2°C (28°F) based on a current 30-year average, there's nothing average with Calgary's weather. Because of the regular but unpredictable chinooks (warm Pacific winds), there's no guarantee of when the cold weather strikes – one of coldest months in the last ten years has been a March (about -6°C \/ 21°F for average high), while a January has recorded one of the mildest (+6°C \/ 43°F average high). Temperatures can swell into the 15°C (59°F) range one day, and dip back into the sub-zero (sub 32°F) temperatures several days later. A typical chinook rolls in fast (and windy), and the effects will usually linger for several days to more than a week. In strong chinooks, you can see the chinook arch to the west: an arch of cloud with clear sky below. Calgary can be very dry in winter, with humidity as low as 20%.\n\nRegardless of the time of year, temperatures usually drop quickly at night. Lows in summer hover around 8°C (46°F), while in winter they average about -13°C (9°F). Because of the elevation, proximity to the mountains, and dramatic temperature drops, snow falling as late as June and as early as September is a regular occurrence. This usually results in just a trace of snow on the ground which soon melts.\n\nAs mentioned, having a variety of clothes is essential at all times in the year. Packing shorts and sandals to light, windproof jacket or fleece from mid-May to mid-October, and everything from T-shirts to fleece\/ski jackets, gloves, scarves from mid-Oct to mid-May works best. There's not typically a lot of snow on the ground since Calgary is located in a very dry region of North America and the regular Chinooks melt any snow, so heavy boots aren't usually needed. The close-by Rockies are typically cooler year-round, so plan accordingly for any day trips.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By plane "]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.calgaryairport.com\/ Calgary International Airport"]}]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["YYC"]]},").

Trains run every 10 minutes (5 minutes or less in rush hour and 15 minutes on holidays) First trains are between 4 and 5AM, and last trains are between 1 and 2AM—slightly earlier on Sundays. During the Calgary Stampede and on New Year's Eve, the C-Train runs all night and some bus routes have extended hours of service. Check ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.calgarytransit.com\/ Calgary Transit's website"]}," for details if you'll be visiting at this time.\n\nAlthough buses come along less often, and tend to serve commuters more than tourists, it is still possible to get around to the main places without too much difficulty. Bus routes usually service either downtown or an LRT station, and run from around 5AM-1AM. Depending on the route, frequencies can be as low as one per hour in outlying suburbs, although 20 or 30 minutes is more typical. Buses numbered in the 300-399 range are rapid buses intended to provide service like a train: they only stop at major streets and large bus terminals, and run relatively frequently. Buses with word 'express' in their name only run during rush hour and serve commuters that go to and from downtown. Most major bus routes use low-floor buses equipped with ramps—the express routes are the exception, using 1970s-era buses.\n\nTransit tickets are $3.00 for adults, and permit 90 minutes of travel on trains and buses, with round trips allowed. Day passes ($9.00 for adults) and books of 10 transit tickets ($30.00) are also available at most convenience stores. Ticket machines at C-Train Stations and platforms sell day passes and regular tickets. These machines accept credit and debit cards as well as cash.\n\nA monthly pass can also be purchased for unlimited usage within the ticket's designated month ($94.00), but is not cost justified unless you intend to commute to downtown daily. The C-Train operates on a \"proof of payment\" honour system. This means there are no turnstiles, but inspectors (usually 'peace officers' employed by Calgary Transit) randomly check for valid tickets, transfers, or passes. There is a ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.calgarytransit.com\/html\/bylaw.html $250 fine"]}," for transit riders unable to present proof of payment. Travel on the C-Train in the downtown free fare zone is free of charge. An announcement is made when the train is about to leave this zone.\n\nInformation about the transit system is available on ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.calgarytransit.com Calgary Transit's website"]},", or by phoning their information line +1 403-262-1000 from 6AM-9PM, local time. Train times are displayed on large electronic signs at stations. Next bus information can be obtained by calling +1 403-974-4000, or texting 74000 with the bus stop number, which can be found on the bus stop sign.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By car "]},"\nIt is easy to be confused by Calgary's quadrant address system at first, but it is very logical, and, well, systematic.\n\nStreets run north-south and avenues run east-west. Centre St divides the city into east and west, and Centre Ave (and parts of the Bow River) divide the city into north and south. Together these split the city into NE, NW, SE, and SW: the four quadrants. Thus any time you get an address on a numbered street, you MUST get whether it was NE, NW, SE, or SW. Street and avenue numbers—and thus addresses—increase as you move away from Centre St or Centre Ave.\n\nMany of Calgary's roads are numbered, but this is less common in the newer developments. Important roads are often named \"trails,\" but there are many exceptions. Note that newly-built neighbourhoods may not yet appear on maps, whether they be paper or GPS. If you are travelling to these places, it may be a good idea to ask for directions beforehand.\n\nCalgary's downtown core is bounded by the Bow River to the north, the railway tracks to the south (between 9th Ave S and 10th Ave S), 11 St W, and 4 St E. Almost all of the roads in the downtown core are one-way, so look carefully at your map for the direction of traffic on each road when planning your trip. When driving in downtown, watch for one-way signs. 7th Avenue S in the downtown core is for Calgary Transit buses and C-Trains (trams) only; cars driving on 7th Ave may be ticketed and will definitely draw stares and glares from waiting transit commuters.\n\nFor many years, ",{"type":"<","value":["b",["parking in downtown Calgary"]]}," has been the second most expensive in North America, after New York City's. Parking fees of over $25\/day are not unusual. Street parking in downtown (and many other parts of the city) is through the city's",{"type":"[","value":["https:\/\/www.calgaryparking.com\/web\/guest\/howtouseparkplus ParkPlus system"]},". Instead of meters at every downtown parking spot, you will find a ParkPlus pay station in every block. Before you leave your parking spot, you need to note the 4-digit ParkPlus zone number on a sign near your car. Also note your licence plate number, if you have a rented car. Go to the ParkPlus pay station, where you will need to type in that information, and pay for your parking either with a credit card or with coins ($2, $1, $0.25). If you set up a ParkPlus account before your visit, you can also pay using your cell phone. The ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.calgaryparking.com\/web\/guest\/myparkingapp MyParking app"]}," can help you find available parking more quickly.\n\nIn general the city's driving situation is a result of rapid, unanticipated growth, so prepare for the roads being grossly inadequate and gridlocked during rush hour. (Outside of rush hour, traffic is not usually a problem.) Also watch for lane reversal rules during these peak times on weekdays (6:30AM–8:30AM and 3:30PM–6:30PM) when going in and out of downtown on some larger streets (e.g. Memorial Drive, 10th St NW). This increases the traffic flow in one direction by \"borrowing\" a lane normally going the other way.\n\nWinter driving is very different from driving in other seasons. Major roads are ploughed, salted, and sanded, but smaller residential streets have very little snow removal or winter maintenance. In Fall 2011, the city instituted snow route parking bans. This means after a heavy snowfall certain priority routes in the city – marked as snow removal routes with blue snowflake street signs – become no parking zones for 72 hours; this includes some residential streets, so bear this in mind if you're visiting family and have parked on the street during the winter.\n\nAs confounding as driving in Calgary may be, driving is still the best way to explore and see the city.\n\nIf you need to hire a car to explore the city or head out into the surrounding area check the prices from agencies on Macleod Trail, you may get a better deal than in the centre or at the airport.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" On foot "]},"\nDowntown Calgary is a compact area which is easily accessible on foot. The pathway system, Eau Claire Market area and Stephen Avenue Walk (8th Avenue) are the primary walking destinations of downtown workers in the warmer months.

(A cycle track is a bike lane that is protected from other traffic by physical barriers, such as concrete medians.) The 7th St SW cycle track goes from the Bow River to 8th Ave SW. A second downtown cycle track, on 1 St SE, is proposed (Feb 2014).\n\nDowntown, there are many pathways along the rivers and park areas. Though Calgary can be thought of as a safe city, use common sense when biking at dusk and at night. This is particularly true on the east side of downtown along the river (close to the neighbourhood of East Village), which is a rougher end of town.\n\nCalgary has a good network of off-street bike paths, although motorists are sometimes less than courteous. Weather is unpredictable, and snowy cycling conditions may occur any time from September to May. Some bike paths are cleared of snow in winter. Bike racks are fairly common, especially in shopping areas. Be sure to use the bike racks provided, or another solid object to lock you bike to; as simply locking your back wheel will not provide sufficient security. Calgary Transit has bike racks at C-Train stations and allows ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.calgarytransit.com\/html\/bikes_on_board.html bikes on the C-Trains"]}," during off-peak hours (at no additional fee).

Bicycles are also prohibited from using the Deerfoot Trail freeway (Hwy 2). \n\nCyclists must obey the same ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.calgary.ca\/cps\/Pages\/Traffic\/Bicycle-safety.aspx rules"]}," of the road as other vehicles. All cyclists must have a working bell on their bike, and cyclists under the age of 18 are required to wear a helmet. Only cyclists under 14 may ride on sidewalks. \n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:AgricultureTrailBridge-s01.jpg"],["thumbnail"],["This bike trail along the Elbow River was washed away by the June 2013 floods"]]},"\nEach major body of water in the city (Bow River, Elbow River, Glenmore Reservoir) has city parks with bike paths. These bike paths are heavily used during the morning rush hour to work, but can provide hours of scenic pedalling. A scenic route starts in downtown and head along the Bow River pathway as it heads south to Fish Creek Provincial Park. Here, leave the banks of the Bow River and cycle though Fish Creek park along the main cycle path path until you reach the Glenmore Reservoir (a good place for lunch). At the reservoir, as the bike path crosses the dam, leave the Bow River pathway for the Elbow River pathway. This highly scenic path will take you back to downtown. Cycle time: 4–6 hours (with lunch).\n\nAnother major pathway extends north up Nose Creek valley just east of the zoo, including two overpasses to cross Deerfoot Trail (a busy freeway). While there is a pathway that leads to the airport, connecting to it requires crossing an industrial area, which is not recommended for novice cyclists. Cyclists are not permitted on Stephen Avenue Walk or Deerfoot Trail.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" See "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Calgary Zoo Africa.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["right"],["The African Savannah Building at the Calgary Zoo"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:StampedeGrandstand-s01.jpg"],["thumbnail"],["400px"],["Stampede Grandstand"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Landmarks "]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Calgary Tower"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.calgarytower.com"],["email="],["address=101 9th Ave SW"],["lat=51.044507"],["long=-114.063117"],["directions=corner of 9th Ave SW & Centre St"],["phone=+1 403-266-7171"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=The Calgary Tower may not be quite as impressive as the CN Tower in Toronto, but it still commands a great view over the city and the surroundings.

While Calgary doesn't have a single signature dish, residents are very proud of Alberta beef, and Calgarians are discerning clients of steakhouses. Speaking of beef, the popular Chinese-Canadian dish of ginger beef was invented in Calgary in the 1970s. Chocolaterie Bernard Callebaut (also called Cococo), winner of international awards for chocolate-making, is based in Calgary, with many stores in the city.\n\nCalgary is also home to a very culturally diverse population, with a very wide selection of international restaurants, especially from East and Southeast Asia, and the Mediterranean from Italy through Lebanon. Calgary is, however, generally lacking in decent Mexican food (see exceptions below), and the inland location means that a good meal of seafood is sometimes hard to find.\n\nRestaurants in the downtown area are very busy between noon and 1PM on weekdays due to the lunch crowd of office workers; if you can, try to stagger your lunch to start around 11:15 or 1:30. You'll face much shorter lineups. Buffets are often only prepared once for lunchtime, and visiting a buffet after 12:15 or so will typically be a depressing dining experience.\n\nCalgary is also the city of founding for major Canadian restaurant chains Hy's, Original Joe's, and Moxies. (The original Calgary Hy's Steakhouse closed in 2006.)\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Budget "]},"\nCalgary's most abundant ethnic specialty is Vietnamese.

Culturally, Calgary is a mash-up of small town culture and big city living, and driving in Calgary is no exception. If you come from a small town in rural North America, the drivers would be considerably more aggressive than you are used to. If you are from a larger busier urban area, or are from Europe for instance, Calgary drivers can be considered quite timid and under-skilled. A driver from New York, London or even Montreal and Toronto would consider the Calgary driver to lack confidence more than anything. Calgarians are generally quite aware of pedestrians and usually give pedestrians right of way, as required by law. Calgarians are generally safe and cautious (some consider overly cautious) drivers, though. Note though that Calgarians are probably some of the best inclement weather drivers in the world.

The key to winter driving is to slow down, as the main hazard in winter is slippery roads due to snow, ice, or slush. Remember, your vehicle – whether it's a compact car or an SUV – relies on four surfaces, each the size of the palm of your hand, to grip the road. When you drive faster, or drive on a slippery surface, that means less traction. So the solution for slippery roads is to slow down to give your car a better grip on the road surface. (Winter tires help too: If renting a car in winter, request winter tires, because not all rental cars have winter tires equipped.) In the worst winter driving conditions, you may see drivers on 100 km\/h roads drop down to 60 km\/h for safety. By slowing down and significantly increasing your following distance, you can safely navigate through most winter road conditions. Winter road conditions are available online from ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/511.alberta.ca\/ Alberta Transportation"]}," and the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/amaroadreports.ca\/ Alberta Motor Association"]},".\n\nAlthough Calgary doesn't get a lot of heavy snow, temperatures below freezing can allow ice to form on many roads. The most dangerous condition is when the ice is a clear sheet which resembles the road, called \"black ice\". Black ice is most commonly seen on bridge decks and other elevated roadways such as on- and off-ramps, where the road surface cools more quickly and so is more prone to freezing. Black ice most dangerous times to drive in these conditions are the two or three days immediately following the first major snowfall of the year. Black ice can also form after a period of warmer weather, such as in late fall, early spring, or after a winter chinook, when melting snow can turn to ice overnight. Freezing rain is not often seen in the Calgary area, but sometimes happens in late fall or early spring, when an evening shower is followed by overnight lows that drop below freezing, covering the roads with ice.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Weather"]}," in Calgary is unpredictable from fall through spring.
