In 1848 the discovery of gold in the Sierra Nevada mountains kicked off the California Gold Rush, and California's non-native population surged from 15,000 to over 300,000 within two years.\n\nCalifornia was recognized as a state in 1850, and its population increased steadily since then. Today California is the most populous state in the US with over 38 million residents.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\nWith over 160,000 square miles (411,000 km",{"type":"<","value":["sup",["2"]]},") the landscape of California is vast and varied.

The coastal mountains rise up from the ocean and are home to redwood trees in the northern half.  The Central Valley bisects California from north-to-south before giving way to the Sierra Nevada mountains, home of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yosemite National Park"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks"]]}," and other natural wonders.  The southeastern part of California is dominated by desert, which covers 25% of California's total area.  The Mojave is a high desert, with elevations ranging from 3,000 to 6,000 feet above sea level.  This area receives less than six inches of rain each year.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nThe state's climate varies from subtropical at the coast to the brutal winters of the mountains to one of the world's hottest regions in the deserts.  Rainfall is more common in the northern part of the state than in the south, and snow is rare except in the mountains.\n\nThe hottest temperature ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere, 134°F (56.6°C) was at Death Valley in 1913, and temperatures regularly exceed 120°F (50°C) during the summer.  In contrast, winter temperatures in the mountains can drop below 0°F (-20°C).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["People"]},"\nCalifornia is a very diverse state with many ethnic groups.  California has large populations of people of varied backgrounds such as Mexican, Salvadoran, Guatemalan, Armenian, Iranian, Jewish, Chinese, Russian, Filipino, Eastern Indian, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Thai, and Hmong.  California also has large populations of African Americans and Native Americans.\n\nCalifornians have a wide variety of political views.  The Central Valley, Orange County, San Diego, and Palm Springs area tend to be more conservative, while Los Angeles County and the San Francisco Bay area tend to be more liberal. \n\nCalifornia is a very large and populous state, with very different cultures in each region.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nAll major road entrances (including entrances from other U.S. States) to California have agricultural inspection stations  to ensure that some fruits and vegetables do not cross into a region where they may come into contact with the farms in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Central Valley (California)"],["Central Valley"]]},". Often, travelers are subject to border inspection (somewhat strict for domestic travel) and asked if they have been on a farm or are carrying organic matter with them.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nCalifornia is the third largest state of the U.S. in terms of size.  It compares in size with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sweden"]]},". However, getting around California can be simple.  \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:California State Route 1 in Marin County.jpg"],["California State Route 1"],["thumb"],["right"],["250px"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:405 southbound near Getty Museum.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["250px"],["Interstate 405 in Los Angeles"]]},"\nIn addition to interstates and US highways, California has one of the most expansive state highway systems in the United States.  As with all trips in the United States, a car is usually the best way to get around and see all destinations.  However the trip from the top of California to the bottom can take well over ten hours. The coast route (State Route 1 and U.S. 101) is much slower and windier than Interstate 5, and GPS travel estimate times may be inaccurate - especially on Highway 1.  \n\nMost California drivers are courteous and careful (although speeding is rampant), and the safety and ease of driving in California is comparable to most First World industrialized countries.  Exceptions may be found in the most congested areas of San Francisco and Los Angeles, where road rage and reckless driving are commonplace.\n\nCalifornia uses the MUTCD (Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices) lane marking system standard throughout the United States, in which dashed white lines divide lanes of through traffic and yellow divides opposing traffic (with single dashed indicating passing and double solid indicating no passing).  In many urban areas the lane markings are replaced by Botts dots for additional tactile feedback when crossing lanes.  \n\nThe network of freeways in major population centers are often confusing and intimidating to those unfamiliar with the area so having a good map is very helpful.  Almost all exits from freeways are on the right.  At interchanges between freeways, in most cases, the flow of traffic continues through the left lanes with the transition to the other freeway being in the right lanes.  \n\nNote that at certain freeway interchanges, Caltrans (California Dept. of Transportation) is notorious for posting advance direction signs that do not correctly explain which lanes correspond to which ramps.  Additionally, Caltrans does not always post signs warning of upcoming lane drops or merges.  \n\nFor example, where a freeway has three through lanes and the central lane splits into two lanes, thus resulting in two ramps with two lanes each, the advance signage may incorrectly imply that only the right lane will break off for the upcoming right-side ramp, thus causing visitors driving in the middle lane to merge unnecessarily into the right lane.  And the two lanes on the right-side ramp may suddenly merge into each other without any warning.  \n\nThese issues frequently result in visitors making wild last-minute lane merges.  The 2009 national MUTCD is intended to remediate this problem (as seen in California and several other states) by mandating the use of detailed arrows on direction signs that clearly show which lanes split into new lanes at upcoming interchanges, but California has not yet implemented the new MUTCD standard.  Thus, one should approach major freeway interchanges in California with caution.  \n\nMile-based exit numbering is currently in progress but is still very erratic in areas; an exit number may not be marked at all, may be marked on the last directional sign before the exit, or may be marked on the final \"EXIT\" sign itself where the exit ramp separates.\n\nMost highways are freely accessible, although there are a handful of toll roads in Orange County, Riverside County, and San Diego.  All major bridges in the San Francisco Bay Area have toll plazas on traffic in only one direction.  All California toll plazas have cash lanes.  Cash toll lanes are usually manned by human toll collectors, but some of the Orange County toll roads use only vending machines in the cash lanes which accept bills and coins.   California toll plazas do not have \"exact change\" lanes where drivers may toss change in a basket.  All California toll plazas also have lanes for FasTrak electronic toll collection transponders which can be used throughout the state.  FasTrak is not compatible with any other state's ETC system.  Going through a FasTrak-only lane without a transponder or an active FasTrak account ",{"type":"''","value":["will"]}," result in a very expensive ticket.  \n\nIn major metropolitan areas, the access ramps to a freeway may have two lanes, one marked with a diamond and the other with a traffic signal.  The diamond lane (called the \"carpool lane\") is for vehicles with two or more persons and motorcycles.  Vehicles with a single person must use the lane with the traffic light.  During high-traffic times, the traffic light spaces out the vehicles attempting to merge onto the freeway.  Be sure to read the sign below the light as some ramps allow two or three vehicles per green.  A few interchanges between freeways are now using controlled access lights to lighten the gridlock at interchanges.\n\nSome freeways have a high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane located along the center divider.  This lane, also called the carpool lane, is marked by signage on the wall separating the two sides of the freeway, and in Southern California by a double-yellow line. In most cases, this lane is for two or more persons per vehicle.  Many carpool lanes are in effect during rush hour only, and a few selected areas, notably in the Bay Area, require three or more per vehicle so check the signage before entering a carpool lane.  Motorcycles may also use carpool lanes. Carpool lanes in Southern California are usually in effect 24 hours a day, and have limited access points marked by a dashed white line. This is the only point at which a vehicle may legally enter or exit a carpool lane, since you are not allowed to cross a double yellow line. Minimum fine for unlawful use of a carpool lane is $341.  \n\nAll persons in a moving vehicle are required to wear a seatbelt and the driver and all passengers can be individually ticketed for failing to do so.  Motorcycle riders must wear a helmet.  Cellphone users are required to use a hands-free headset if talking on the phone while driving, and texting by the driver is illegal.  Unless otherwise signed, right-turns are permitted at red lights following a full stop. If it is raining hard enough to require you to use your windshield wipers, California law requires that your headlights be turned on.\n\nCalifornia does not have stationary photo radar cameras like in other countries, and mobile manned photo radar units are rare and still experimental.  However, most California police officers do carry radar guns and use them often, and on rural freeways, the California Highway Patrol occasionally flies aircraft overhead to spot speeders and help ground units home in on their positions.  Red light enforcement cameras are in use at many urban intersections, but are usually marked only by a single \"PHOTO ENFORCED\" sign before the intersection.  Even more confusing, all approaches to an intersection may be marked with \"PHOTO ENFORCED\" signs when only one or two actual movements across the intersection are really photo-enforced.  The cameras must obtain a clear view of the driver's face and license plate before a ticket may be issued.\n\nCalifornia's laws against driving under the influence of alcohol are very strict; the maximum permissible blood alcohol concentration is 0.08%.  All drivers are strongly encouraged to call 911 to report drunk drivers.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Major highways"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:California State Route 1 All American Road sign.jpg"],["150px"],["thumb"],["right"],["A California State Highway sign.

Los Angeles has some of the largest Hispanic populations north of Mexico.
