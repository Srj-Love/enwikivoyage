Calistoga was founded as a hot springs resort in the 1860s by Sam Brannan, California's first millionaire, and has long been a destination for its natural hot springs and mineral water and their supposed health benefits. Its position at the north end of the Napa Valley also makes it a gateway to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sonoma County"]]}," wine country.

After the time of Spanish missions and Mexican ranchos, Samuel Brannan bought 2000 acres, founding Calistoga and starting the Indian Springs resort.  The resort eventually went into the hands of Doctor John Wilkinson, the founder of the spa industry.\n\nDue to the spa industry, the California wine boom of the 1970s (which Calistoga is responsible for through Chateau Montelena Winery's surprise Chardonnay win at the 1976 French blind tasting,) the ensuing tourism, and the proximity to San Francisco (which in turn has fueled more tourism,) Calistoga, like the rest of the Napa Valley, has maintained very high property value which has increased the cost of living and essentially the price of everything from coffee to gasoline.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.flysfo.com San Francisco International Airport"]}]},", ☎ +1 650 821-8211. 90-120 min away by car."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.sacairports.org\/int\/ Sacramento International Airport"]}]},". 90–120 minutes away by car."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.flyoakland.com\/ Oakland International Airport"]}]},".  80–110 minutes away by car."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.sonomacountyairport.org\/ Charles M.
