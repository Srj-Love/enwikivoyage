The body of water separating Whidbey Island and Camano Island is called Saratoga Passage.\n\nCamano Island is named for the Spanish explorer Jacinto Caamaño. Charles Wilkes, during the Wilkes Expedition of 1838-1842, named it MacDonough Island in honor of Thomas MacDonough for his victory of the Battle of Lake Champlain during the War of 1812. Following this theme, Wilkes named the body of water between Camano and Whidbey Island after MacDonough's flagship the Saratoga. When Henry Kellett reorganized the official British Admiralty charts in 1847, he removed Wilkes' name MacDonough and bestowed the name Camano, which the Spanish had originally given to Admiralty Inlet in 1790. Wilkes' name Saratoga Passage was retained.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nCamano Island is separated from mainland Snohomish County by Davis Slough near the city of Stanwood.
