Looking like 2m tall mushrooms, they were formed when a cap of more resistant rock protected the softer rock underneath from erosion.  Hoodoos can be found in other parts of the region, but this trail makes a few of them easy to visit. A picture there shows that, sadly, there are fewer hoodoos now than even a few decades ago, as erosion and tourist curiosity take their toll. The trail is under 1km and an easy scramble across rocks.
