Cambridge University has many famous alumni, including: mathematicians such as Sir Isaac Newton, philosophers such as Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein, and writers such as John Milton and Lord Byron.

It is wise to be on your guard around Regent Street & St Andrew’s Street after midnight with anti-social behaviour due to people leaving pubs and nightclubs. Also, the local homeless are known to be excessive consumers of alcohol so stay clear at them at night.\n\nIf you have a bike, keep it locked up to a solid object with a strong lock (preferably a D-lock), as cycle theft is big business. There are cycle parking places with cycle stands to lock you bike to, in several places around the city centre and at the railway station. \"Secure\" covered cycle parking with CCTV surveillance and cycle stands is available in the lower section of the Park Street car park and at the Grand Arcade cycle park.\n\nThe city's police station is on Parkside which is next door to the city's fire station. The opening times of the enquiry office is everyday 8AM-10PM and bank holidays 9AM-5PM. There are a couple of smaller stations in the nearby villages of Histon and Sawston. The opening time of the enquiry office is for Histon, Mondays; 4PM-8PM, Wednesdays to Fridays; 8AM - midday, with Tuesdays, weekends and bank holidays closed. For Sawston, it is Wednesdays to Friday; 1PM-5PM, Mondays, weekends and bank holidays closed. The non-emergency contact number is 101, calls are fixed rate of £0.15 on landlines and mobiles.\n\nThe city's Accident and Emergency department (Casualty department) is located at Addenbrooke's Hospital on Hills Road, south of the city centre.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By telephone"]},"\n\nThe local telephone code for Cambridge is 01223.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By internet"]},"\n\nThere are many ",{"type":"'''","value":["cybercafes"]}," in Cambridge and free Wi-Fi is available in many cafes and pubs.
