The latter of these opened up East Cambridge for industrial development led by furniture and glass factories. A major influx of penniless Irish immigrants fleeing the potato blight in 1845 increased the Irish population to 22 per cent in the next ten years. Toward the end of that century they were followed by immigrants from Italy, Poland, Portugal, and Germany. French Canadians and Russian Jews also came at this time. A small African American population had been growing from colonial times, attracted by the integrated schools.\n\nThe result today is a highly diverse population augmented and further diversified by brilliant men and women drawn to Cambridge over the years by Harvard, Radcliffe and M.I.T., and, in recent years, by the local high technology companies. \"Cantabrigians\" (from the city's Latin name, Cantabrigia) are regarded as progressive and tolerant. Decline of the industrial base in the early 1900s led Cambridge to become an intellectual center. Universities are the major employers, but cutting edge companies in information technology and biotechnology such as Akamai Technologies, Genzyme, Biogen Idec, and Novartis are located adjacent to the MIT campus in the Kendall Square area.\n\nCambridge now advertises itself as \"a city where counter-culture still lives, classic culture thrives, and multicultural is a way of life.\" \"Boston's Left Bank: A little funkier, a little spunkier and definitely spicier than Boston.\"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Cambridge Office for Tourism"],["url=http:\/\/www.cambridge-usa.org"],["email="],["address=4 Brattle St."],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Harvard Sq."],["phone =+1 617 441-2884 or +1 617 497-1630"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=M-Sa 9AM-5PM, Su 1PM-5PM"],["price="],["content=Volunteers staff the Visitor Information Booth, located just outside the main Harvard Square T-stop, and are available to distribute maps and brochures and to answer questions."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Logan International Airport"]},",",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.masport.com\/logan\/"]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boston"]]},".

Service begins for the day after 5:30AM and ends before 12:15AM on week-days.  Week-end schedules are slightly different and do not open until 6:30AM on Sundays.  Transport still runs for a short time after this — stated times are \"first train leaves the station\" or \"last train leaves the station\" — and thus, to complete the route, will actually be in service for as much as an hour longer or an hour before, but it is imperative to find out when last service is scheduled to the stations you need, and allot time for early or late arrivals.\n\nMBTA employees can offer information on scheduling, but are not always available at all stations.  Communication between stations is complex and while significant changes will be announced, often T employees themselves are not informed of delays or minor changes.  Bus stations that are not also subway stations are unstaffed.\n\nAs of July 2009, subway fare is $2 and includes transfers between all four subway lines (Red, Green, Orange and Blue) and bus fare varies between $1.50 and $5 and also includes transfers.  Fares are paid via a stored value ticket available in vending machines at subway stations.  Fare is discounted if using the freely available reusable plastic pass, which can be obtained at Harvard Square station, 7-11 convenience stores or Star supermarkets.\n\nInformation on fares, routes, delays and schedule changes is available at the MBTA's web site.",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.mbta.com\/"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Parking at the Alewife station on the Red line is ample and costs $8 per 24 hour period.",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.mbta.com\/schedules_and_maps\/subway\/lines\/stations\/?stopId=10029"]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" MBTA Commuter Rail (color-coded purple) leaves from Porter Square, serving one of the twelve commuter rail lines.

The places that they will queue are designated as cab stands by street signs.  Taxis are less abundant in Porter Square and rare near Alewife and Lechmere.\n\nIt is possible to signal a taxi from the sidewalk by waving an arm or a hand — a taxi cruising for fares is watching the crowds for this — and have it stop for you; however, taxi drivers from towns and cities other than Cambridge are heavily penalised if they accept passengers flagging them down on the street.
