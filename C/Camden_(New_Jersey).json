Decades of disinvestment and government mismanagement have contributed to Camden's sky-high crime rate, and many of the city's neighborhoods are hotbeds of gang- and drug-related violence. However, the government has, in recent years, begun developing the Delaware River waterfront, which is now a popular and well-traveled tourist destination offering grand views of the Philadelphia skyline and a multitude of activities for adults and children alike. Headlines about violence and crime in Camden may dissuade many tourists to the Philadelphia area from visiting, but a one-day trip to the waterfront may be well worth the trip.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nNearly all attractions in Camden are located along the Camden waterfront, which offers family-friendly activities and scenic views of Philadelphia across the Delaware River. The downtown area contains the Rutgers University-Camden campus and the city's small central business district. The Camden waterfront and downtown areas are considered safe and are patrolled by police. Although the rest of Camden is plagued by urban blight, poverty, and gang-related drug violence, you will be safe as long as you stay in the waterfront and downtown areas and take sensible precautions.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.njtransit.com New Jersey Transit"]}]}," handles bus routes into the city."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Megabus"]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.megabus.com"]},".
