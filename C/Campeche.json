Campeche grew into the leading port in the Peninsula in the colonial era. The city's walls and a series of forts were built in the 16th century to guard against frequent pirate attacks. With independence from Spain at the start of the 1800s Campeche was at first part of the state of Yucatán, but separated with the creation of the State of Campeche mid century. \n\nToday Campeche is a fast growing city, but has maintained its history with meticulously preserved walls and historic buildings. Especialy outside of the city center, Campeche is a still fairly laid back place and can feel more like a small town. The city is still relatively compact and easy to get around, although as the city grows even bigger, that is slowly changing. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nCampeche City has an airport.

The best bet is to fly into the large international airport at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mérida (Yucatan)"],["Mérida, Yucatan"]]}," and bus or drive to Campeche. This can also be done from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cancún"]]},", although it may take an extra day just to get to the state.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nFrom the Autobuses del Oriente (ADO) station in Mérida, buses leave almost every hour for the two hour  drive to Campeche, which costs roughly 144 pesos (US$10). Since it is a short run, second class buses can also be taken, although this offers only small savings (10 or 20 MXM).\n\nFrom Ciudad del Carmen, buses to Campeche are also very frequent and cost roughly 130 pesos (US$13). The trip is about two hours and three quarters, longer by second class bus.\n\nFrom Cancun, the trip to Campeche takes six hours and a half to complete and costs roughly 300 pesos (US$30). There are four buses to Campeche every day.\n\nFrom Mexico City, Campeche is a lengthy 17 hour drive and this trip costs from 800 to 950 pesos (US$80-US$95). A first class bus is recommended.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nBecause Campeche is still a small city, it can be easy to navigate on foot, although the oppressive heat and humidity that dominates most of the year may make this impossible. If you are staying in the historic center, this is the best option.  \n\nOtherwise or for visiting attractions away from the old town, it is best to get around the city by taxi or bus. Taxi fares are charged by zone; to go from the ADO bus station to downtown, the cost is roughly 30 pesos, or $3 US. The city runs many public buses. They tend to be small, hot, usually cramped and in varying states of disrepair. The fare, however, is cheap at just 6 pesos, so they're convenient for budget travelers or the adventurous. The bus driver will make change, but don't try to offer large bills as they likely won't be accepted.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Baluarte de Santiago"]}," - It was built in the 18th Century.

The central market is quite small by Mexican standards and it doesn't offer handicrafts like many other do in the country. Outside the market, vendors hawk various items, the most interesting of which are hammocks, a Yucatan specialty.\n\nFor travellers looking for a piece of home or just wanting to buy clothing, there are several grocery\/department stores located around the city. Super San Fransisco de Assiss has four locations in the city, one of which is on the Gulf of Mexico near the cinema. Another is located by the university, but it's not a central location. The biggest, and cheapest store, is Chedraui, located on Avenida Gobernadores about a 10 minute walk north of the old bus station. It features a full department store, a grocery store and a small restaurant, and has several banks in the vicinity.\n\nUnfortunately, because Campeche is not very tourist oriented, knickknacks and handicrafts are hard to come by.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nCampeche is well known for its seafood, especially shrimp (camarón) and shark (cazón) and both are widely available.\n\nThe only North American chains in the city are Burger King and Church's Chicken (located north of the cinema), so visitors have extra incentive to eat local. The are many small restaurants located in the historic center, all ranging in price, but try to watch food preparation before you buy. Outside of the historic centre, Avenida Gobernadores offers a plethora of eating establishments, but again, watch the food preparation and then decide.\n\nFor a good vegan\/vegetarian option, try Natura2000, on Calle 12 #155, next to the Iglesia de Jesus church. \n\nThere are a few grocery stores in the city. All have a small restaurant, deli, bakery, grocery, meat and produce departments. If you have a sweet tooth, the Chedraui bakery is a must. Donuts, sweet bread, danishes, muffins and cookies are all sold in bulk and baked fresh in store, and the prices are cheap. You can also pick up bread from the bakery and meat from the deli to make your own sandwiches. These grocery stores, especially Chedraui, are impressive and offer all of the variety of an American store. For travellers on a budget, or those not comfortable with food from small establishments with questionable cleanliness standards, these stores are a godsend.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nThere are a few hotels on the Malecon (Av. Adolfo Ruiz Cortines), which runs the entire length of the city along the Gulf of Mexico. Most are relatively expensive, but offer clean and comfortable accommodations. There are also a few hotels located in the historic center, particularly near the center square, and they are much cheaper in price. Unfortunately, because Campeche has a very small tourist industry, accommodations can be hard to find.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Baluartes Hotel"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.baluartes.com.mx\/"],["email="],["address=Av. 16 de Septiembre No. 128"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=between calle 59 & 61, on the Bay"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=Built as a luxury hotel in 1960, it's seen better days, but still offers a convenient location and rooms with a good view of the Gulf."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Monkey Hostel"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.hostalcampeche.com"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=Describes itself as \"Mexico's Alternative Destination.\" It is located in the Centro Histórico, in front of the cathedral on the Plaza Principal.
