[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"],["pgname=Campeche"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Campeche"]}," is a state of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mexico"]]}," on the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yucatán Peninsula"]]},". It is on the eastern side of the Peninsula bordering the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Regions"]},"\n\nCampeche state is divided into 11 municipalities: Calkiní, Campeche, Carmen, Champotón, Hecelchakán, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Holpelchén"]]},", Palizada, Tenabo, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Escárcega"]]},", Calakmul, and Candelaria. As Campeche is one of the smallest states in Mexico population-wise (roughly 700,000 people in 2000), many of these municipalities are sparsely populated. The largest are Campeche, where the state capital of the same name is located and Carmen, home of Ciudad del Carmen, the capital of Mexico's Gulf Coast petroleum industry. These two districts account for two thirds of the state's population. \n\nAs can easily discerned from the municipio names, the state has a large indigenous population which is scattered through the interior of the state, mostly in the north along the Yucatan border and the centre-south areas. Unlike states like Chiapas, however, this population is not very large, although given the state's small population, indigenous peoples make up a significant proportion of the overall population.\n\nThe topography is basically flat with small hills, much like most of the Yucatan peninsula. The northern areas of the state can be classified as dry savannah, and the area is in danger of desertification, surprisingly. The central parts of the state are heavily wooded, and the southern areas are tropical rainforest. All of these areas, sadly, are under pressure from slash and burn agriculture.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Campeche"]]}," - the capital city "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ciudad del Carmen"]]}," - another large city"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Champotón"]]}," - half way between Campeche and Carmen and is notable for its seafood and beaches"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Escárcega"]]}," - on the highway to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chiapas"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\nOutside of Campeche, the main reason why people come to the state are the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Maya ruins"]},".

Not well restored at present and in a comparatively remote area, they are less visited than more accessible and famous sites. Still they can have a fascination, showing how this now sparsely populated area was once dense with Maya cities and towns. The architecture is in the regionally distinct \"Rio Bec\" Maya style, with sets of tall steep towers and carved stone facades in the form of fantastic animals.  With a car you can visit several of the sites in a day. Serious Maya ruin fans can make more than a day of it; there are a couple of decent places to stay the night around Xpujil.

Referring to the locals as Mexican, rather than Maya (for the Indigenous population) or Campechanos (for the Hispanic population), may risk offending some.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nCampeche has one of the highest percentages of indigenous language speakers in Mexico and this is especially evident in the countryside. Despite that, Spanish is the lingua franca and is understood almost everywhere. However, since the state has been relatively isolated and untouched by international tourism, English is not widely spoken.\n\nTourists should not be embarrassed to try their Spanish, even if only reading from phrasebooks. You will stick out, but the locals will appreciate the effort and be more helpful than if no effort is made at all.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nCampeche City has an airport, although it only has daily flights to Mexico City. Ciudad del Carmen has flights to Mexico City as well as to Houston Texas. Neither are cheap. The best bet is to fly into Mérida, Yucatan and bus to Campeche. This can also be done from Cancún, although it may take an extra day just to get to the state.\n\nFrom the Autobuses del Oriente (ADO) station in Mérida, buses leave almost every hour for the three hour drive to Camepeche, which costs roughly 100 pesos. Since it is a short run, second class buses can also be taken, although this offers only small savings (10 or 20 MXM).\n\nFrom Ciudad del Carmen, buses to Campeche are also very frequent and cost roughly 80 pesos. The trip is about two hours, longer by second class bus.\n\nFrom Cancun, the trip to Mérida takes 5 hours to complete and costs roughly 150 pesos. From there, it is necessary to take another bus to Campeche.\n\nFrom Mexico City, Campeche is a lengthy 24 hour drive and this trip costs 700 pesos. A first class bus is recommended.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nBuses in Mexico offer excellent service at cheap prices, and this is no exception in Campeche. The ADO station in Campeche City has recently been moved to the outskirts of the city from the former location downtown, and the cab ride costs roughly 25 pesos. It is possible to make the trip on city bus, but it is not recommended as these buses are small, hot and in varying states of disrepair. The city bus costs 3 pesos. Look for one that says \"Centro\" in the front window. That will take you to the city market.\n\nFrom this first class station, only a few points within the state can be reached, like Ciudad del Carmen, Champotón and Escárcega. The old bus station on Avenida Gobernadores, near the Chedraui supermarket and roughly a 10 minute walk from the market, offers bus service to other regions of the state. To make it to Calakmul or Edzná, however, it may be necessary to rent a car or hire a tour guide. Other colectivo vans can be found on the way from the market to the second class station, although these mainly serve the suburbs of the city. It is unfortunate that the spectacular sites of the state are poorly served by public transportation, but this is merely a reflection of Campeche's massively underdeveloped tourist industry.\n\nIf you plan to rent a car, it is recommended that you do this in Mérida as there are few, if any, places to do this in Campeche.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nThe City of Campeche, a city immersed in the typically colonial aspect with towers, bastions and walls. The traveler can enjoy all the city’s attractions on board of one of the old time vehicles replicas named \"El Guapo\" (the handsome one) and the \"Tranvía de la Ciudad\" (City's Tram).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Itineraries"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nStroll the old town of Campeche.

The population is still relatively small, and although there are places of profound poverty in the countryside and the cities, people are friendly and warm. The greatest danger comes from the stray dogs that roam the urban areas in packs, especially in the city of Campeche, although this is also the case in most of Mexico.\n\nThat said, Campeche is still a place relatively untouched by tourism and Northamerican culture. Visitors should dress conservatively in long pants and dress shirts, despite the heat. If you are fair skinned, you will stick out anyway, but this can be mitigated by dressing appropriately. Women especially should take this into consideration as it is not uncommon for fair skinned females to be mercilessly harassed.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The state of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yucatan"]]}," is to the North."]},{"type":"*","value":[" The state of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Quintana Roo"]]}," is to the East.
