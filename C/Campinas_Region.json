The real development of the region started in the nineteenth century, with coffee plantations based on European immigrant labor. The coffee farming era left, as a legacy, a formidable network of railways, which would be the basis of the region's industrialization and populational growth beginning in the 1940s.\n\nThe region's most evident sign of economical strength is the Campinas metro area, a 2.8 million metropolis that streches along the Anhanguera and Bandeirantes motorways. Unlike ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Grande São Paulo"]]},", where the metropolis' economical power is highly concentrated in a small number of cities, the various cities that form the Campinas metro area compete evenly in economic development. Yet, the chaotic growth that happened after the 1950s in the state capital also affected the Campinas region, with poverty and criminality becoming a significant problem in some cities of the region.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nThe cities of the Campinas region can typically be reached by intercity buses, provided by various private operators.

As in the rest of the state, the roads with private operators have higher tolls but generally much better quality. Regardless, the road quality is overall quite higher than the Brazilian average, and non-pavimented roads are rare.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Itineraries"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Aguas lindoia balneario.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Mineral spring public bath in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Águas de Lindóia"]]},"."]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Visit the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Paulista Water Circuit"]},", a cluster of towns in the Serra da Mantiqueira mountain range famous for their mineral springs, which can be enjoyed at public baths or at certain hotels.
