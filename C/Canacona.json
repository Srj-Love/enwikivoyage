Closeby is the banks of the Talpona river. Some put its age at 2,000 years old, and say its shade could encompass around a thousand people.\n\nSacred groves -- ancient, protected forests -- are numerous in interior Goa. Kamat sees the one at Morpila (in Canacona's neighbouring Quepem taluka) as the \"most interesting of all\". It protects the source of a mountain stream.\n\nChandranath hill is another topographically-interesting feature. It comprises two hillocks of near-uniform contour height.  One hillock is 300m and the other is 350m high. Scientists suggest a meteorite fell on Chandranath mountain during the pre-historic period. 'Chandrashila', the iron-meteorite worshipped in the temple, further adds to the mystery of this place.\n\nSouth Goa's straight coastline -- of a peculiar linear shape -- stretches from Majorda to Betul, just north of the Canacona-Quepem coast. This could be a much \"younger\" coast (around 6,000-15,000 years young) compared to the rest of the Goan coast, and is a \"trekker's dream-stretch\"."]]},"\n\nCanacona's beach belt, 'discovered' only after the 1990s, is among the most scenic.

The journey is about 2-1\/2 hrs. From the bus stand to Karwar Port, the charge is around Rs 15 for a shared-auto. A trawler takes you to Anjediv. You might need to alight into a small boat before reaching the shore, due to the shallowness of the island waters.\n\nVisits are usually around October or February, during local feasts.\n\nThe entry to island is not restricted.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nGoa's emphasis on foreign tourists - all of them are assumed to be higher-spenders by those in business - means that destinations preferred by foreigners are more in the spotlight. Emphasis on the Westerner's food tastes also lends for either an exotic mix of cuisines, or, alternative, a tastelessly watered-down Goan\/Indian cuisine.\n\nSome places nonetheless manage to come out of this trap quite effectively.\n\nDilip Gaitonde's Palolem Beach Resort, bang on Canacona beach, offer a range from different cuisines. Goan dishes are the favourites. Others on Palolem beach itself include Draupadi (Israeli dishes too), German Bakery (health food, German cakes, pies, strudels, six-grain bread, croissants), Sameer Bar and Restaurant (seafood, Indian, Italian), Silver Star (fish tandoor, sizzlers, beef steak), Ciaran's Camp (pre-booked three-course dinner available), Fernandes Restaurant (Goan food, fresh juices), Cool Breeze (\"food from around the world\" with Jazz), Simba's, Boom Shankar, etc.\n\nLook out for the other 'shacks' that make their appearance on the coastal stretch when the foreign tourist season starts.\nYou can also take an excursion to the coastal, sleepy town of karwar; an hour away from canacona.

Kings brand of beer is local to Goa and is not available outside the state and many locals swear by it. Kingfisher is the nation's best-selling beer and given the fact that its owner, business magnate Vijay Mallya, has several plush properties in Goa, it is hardly surprising that you will find yourself bombarded by Kingfisher advertising. Yet the beer itself is only average and it is recommended that you ask for King's beer first.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=The Lalit Goa Resort"],["alt=The Lalit Goa Resort"],["url=http:\/\/www.thelalit.com\/Goa\/default.aspx"],["email="],["address=InterContinental The Lalit Goa Resort, Raj Baga, Canacona Goa – 403702, India, Tel: 91 832 2667777 Fax: 91 832 2667711"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Canacona Goa"],["phone = +91  832 2667777"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=1 km of exclusive beach and a 9-hole golf course."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Sun Beach Residency"],["url=http:\/\/www.sunbeachgoa.com"],["email="],["address=House no.200, Palolem Patnem road , Sawantwada, Palolem, Canacona, Goa - 403702"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Ahead of Cleopatra Resorts"],["phone=+91-9819514908"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=INR 1300 onwards"],["checkin=11AM"],["checkout=11AM"],["content=Sun Beach Residency being strategically located offers a peaceful and quite stay with 13 comfortably proportioned rooms-equipped with American size beds,en-suite bathrooms,LCD TVs,air-conditioning and afternoon verandahs.At the same time is a short stroll from the lively local market place, curio shops, famous Goan shacks and Palolem beach."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Coastal areas in Canacona are perhaps more used to tourists than the interior.
