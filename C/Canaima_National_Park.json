In practice, the simplest thing to do is sign up for a tour that takes care of the details.

Nearly all the Angel Falls tours operate out of this city, and their prices include the cost of a plane that flies from Ciudad Bolivar to Canaima. Expect to pay between Bs. 500,000 and 600,000 (approximately US $250) for a three-day, two-night tour that brings you to the falls.

Trips up to the Falls, however, will be in a dugout canoe, or curiara. The 30-minute or so walk from the closest point on the river to the base of the Falls is not easy going because of large tree roots on the path and visitors are advised to take sports shoes or suchlike for this hike.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Angel Falls"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:SaltoAngel4.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["A view of Angel Falls"]]},"\nAngel Falls or Salto Ángel is the world's highest ",{"type":"[[","value":[["waterfall"]]},", dropping a total of 978m from the summit of the Auyan Tepuy, and with an 807m uninterrupted drop.\n\nIt is known as ",{"type":"''","value":["Parekupa-meru"]}," by the local Pemon Indians but gained the Angel name after US pilot Jimmy Angel crash-landed on the Auyan Tepuy while searching the area for gold in 1937. Instead, he found the spectacular waterfall. After 11 days of trekking, he reached Kamarata and made his find public. His plane was later recovered and can be seen in front of the airport at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ciudad Bolivar"]]},". After his death in 1956, his ashes were sprinkled over Angel Falls.\n\nAngel Falls is situated in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gran Sabana"]]}," region of Venezuela. The area is filled with grasslands, with some dense jungle along the course of the rivers and at the base of the numerous tepuis, or flat-topped mountains. Angel falls is located on the side of the largest of the Venezuela's tepuis known as Auyan-tepui.\n\nThere is an incredible variety of tropical wildlife in the area, including monkeys, poison arrow frogs and hundreds of species of orchids. Aside from the monkeys, mammals in the area are generally difficult to spot but include giant anteaters, armadillos, porcupines, three-toed sloths, otters, jaguars, pumas, tapirs and capybaras.\n\nAngel Falls is deep within the National Park. The falls are located about 5 hours' ride in a dugout canoe upstream from Canaima village. Most of the Park's attractions can only be visited with a guided tour from Canaima. These can be booked from outside Venezuela, from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Caracas"]]},", or from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ciudad Bolivar"]]}," but prices are much more competitive in Ciudad Bolivar. Most tours that take you to the foot of the falls are two nights (one in Canaima, one at the falls) and three days, and combine all of the three elements below (and also include food and transport). Alternatively you can hire shorter tours just to go up to Angel Falls and back again. A typical tour will include the flight to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Canaima"]]},", and then three days of meals and (very basic) accommodation at the various campsites along the river towards the falls. The trip involves several hours in a dugout canoe and a few hours hiking through gallery forest to the main viewpoint below the falls.

The trek to the top from the tiny village of Uruyen takes three days on rough tracks, and the final climb up a cleft in the massive rock wall is a tough scramble, but the rewards are immense - the landscape is surreal, with clumps of insect-eating pitcher plants clinging to the bare rock, and unlike ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mount Roraima"]]},", you'll barely meet another soul.  Trips typically spend a couple of days on the top, and take 2 days to return to either Uruyen or Kavac.
