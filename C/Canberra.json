Each of these towns has its own suburbs.  You will see signs directing you to each of these towns, but once you get closer the sign will simply direct you to the \"town centre\".

During working hours high demand, from both visitors and employees, can see parking spaces very limited in the Parliamentary Triangle (which contains the National Library, Questacon, Old Parliament House, National Gallery, Commonwealth Place etc.).\n\nThe default speed limit on all roads in the ACT is 50 km\/h, unless signposted otherwise. Major roads in the ACT have speed limits between 60 and 100 km\/h. Occasionally, the same road has a different speed limit for traffic heading in opposite directions. The ACT also has the highest number of speed cameras per capita in Australia. Fixed speed cameras have warning signs in advance via overt signage; red light\/speed cameras have much smaller warning signs, usually not coupled with a sign reminding of the speed limit. Mobile speed camera vans operate in the ACT (typically, but not always, on major roads); these may be overtly or covertly parked, and are identified by a large white sign on the roof.\n\n40 km\/h school zones are active throughout the school day (unlike surrounding New South Wales where they only operate for an hour or two at the beginning and end of the school day). School zones are rigorously policed.\n\nThe main shopping and commercial area of Canberra is known as Civic, but you will never see a signpost to Civic.  It is signposted as \"City\".\n\nTake change for parking meters in Civic if you want to park on the streets, or in the government parking lots. Parking in the town centres is difficult on weekdays. It is also difficult to park at night in Civic. There are several multi-level carparks near the Canberra Centre with ticket pay-stations and pay-booths. Note that all day parking in the Canberra Centre is cheaper on the rooftop level.
