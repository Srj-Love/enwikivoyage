[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Cancún banner Praia Delfines.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Cancun 2.JPG"],["thumb"],["300px"],["El Mirador beach"]]},"\n\nSituated on the northeast tip of Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula, ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cancún"]}," is a popular Caribbean tourist destination. Next to 14 miles of beaches, you'll find a wide variety of resorts, spas, clubs, and malls.\n\nPeak season in Cancún tends to run from December to April. Prices in both airfare and hotel increase dramatically during these times, while dropping in the summer and early autumn months. Late June is especially hot, so come prepared or try the off season. Hurricanes can be a major threat in late summer and autumn.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nResting  on the northeast corner of the Mexican Caribbean, Cancún itself was built on a site selected as the ideal spot for a new tourist development by the Mexican government. The state of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Quintana Roo"]]}," was still a territory and this area had few habitants when Cancún was built.  It is composed of fourteen miles of pristine white beaches shaped like a number \"7\", home of the Mayan archaeological wonders, turquoise seas, a bountiful underwater world, and world-class vacation amenities. It is still considered the gateway to the Mayan World (\"El Mundo Maya\"). Mayan temples and ritual sites are everywhere, some smothered by lush jungle, others easily accessible. Good tourist attractions.\n\nThe Cancún hotel zone is almost entirely built around the tourist industry. It abounds with all-inclusive resort hotels. Stay here only if you don't mind spending your vacation with many other tourists.\n\nDowntown Cancún, especially once you get away from the ADO bus station and nearby hostels and hotels, is a real Mexican city. There are many restaurants, shopping centers, markets and clubs in the downtown area that you can visit during your stay.\n\nThose mostly seeking beaches and scuba diving, or who are a bit adventurous, can easily find rooms on equally beautiful and less crowded beaches along the coast just an hour or two south of Cancún. Some Spanish language skills may aid in finding better deals. You can rent a car, or take the bus to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Puerto Morelos"]]}," (about 20 min) or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tulum"]]}," (1 hr). ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Playa del Carmen"]]}," (45 min, $80) is between the two, but caters to the all-inclusive crowd. Taxis are also available.\n\nThose looking for a base of operations who want good or luxury hotels and the advantages of urban life but prefer more local flavor may wish to stay in the Yucatan's main city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mérida (Yucatan)"],["Mérida"]]},". Many international flights in to Cancún continue on after a stop to Mérida's International Airport.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Climate "]},"\nThe climate in Cancún is tropical, with consistent hot and humid weather throughout the year, and very warm sea temperatures. You can expect a gentle breeze from the ocean to keep you comfortable. Temperatures reach their peak around May, and you may notice the extreme heat as you travel inland. Prepare for trips to archeological sites: wear light clothing, stay cool, and rest often.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nAirlines that fly to Cancún from Mexico City include: Aeromexico, Interjet, Volaris; from the USA: ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.airtran.com AirTran Airways"]},", American Airlines, Delta Airlines, United Airlines, Jetblue, USA 3000, US Airways and from Europe: AirBerlin Air France, British Airways, Air Europa, Aeroflot and as of 2012 Virgin Atlantic.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.asur.com.mx\/asur\/ingles\/aeropuertos\/cancun\/cancun.asp Cancún International Airport"]}]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["CUN"]]},") is Mexico's second busiest airport. It is about 10 km (6 mi) from the hotel strip and 16 km (9 mi) southwest of downtown.\n\nOne of Cancún's best features is its transport links, as most major air carriers in North, Central, and South America, have service to Cancún. There are some extremely cheap charter flight deals available from the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["UK"]]}," (from around £100) as well as commercial flight deals from several European carriers.\n\nThe hardest part of the journey to Cancún (aside from your initial airport check-in) is getting from the luggage carousel to your transportation. Make sure you know who your transport is (in case of prebooking) and find them on the outside, as that is where they will be. Unless you are looking for a timeshare, free meal or looking to burn hours of travel time and money on your vacation, do NOT stop to chit-chat with anyone about booking tours and such. There is plenty of time for that after you get settled in. After you clear customs inspection (the red or green light baggage inspection), do not give your bags to any locals offering to carry them.\n\nThere are many companies that provide the transfer service to the hotels in Cancún or the Riviera Maya. All of them have the option of prebooking online; some of them can be booked when arriving but this may represent another waiting time. Some of the well-known companies offering shared and private transfers are:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cancun-cab.com\/  Cancun-Cab"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.bestday.com\/  BestDay"]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.discoverymundo.com\/transportation  Discovery Mundo"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.graylinecancun.com\/  Gray Line"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/wwww.yellowtransfers.com\/en  Yellow Transfers"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cancuntaxishuttle.com\/  Cancun Taxi Shuttle"]}]},"There are other transportation firms that provide service to and from the airport for a reasonable price as well. Beware of touts who will surround you when you come out of customs clearance. If you proceed straight, you will find the official information center where they can help you with the ground transportation options. If you bought an online shuttle service reservation and you don't find your driver, call customer service yourself; do not trust local people who claim to be airport employees trying to help you (usually airport employees wait for you to come to them, and not the other way round).  The legitimate drivers (and their reps) for these shuttle companies are outside the building, outside the exit glass doors, towards their vehicles.\n\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ado.com.mx ADO"]}," is the main long distance inter-city bus carrier in the Yucatan Peninsula. They offer regular bus service from both terminals at the airport into town and down to Playa del Carmen.  The \"airport bus station\" is in the parking lot outside the domestic arrivals doors at Terminal 2.  For international arrivals you turn right, after coming out of the building and walk across to the other side of the building. At Terminal 3 it's a right turn from outside the arrivals doors and past 'Air Margaritaville' (formerly 'Coconuts Welcome Bar') hut.\n\nAlso if you want to travel directly from Cancún to Cozumel there is an Airline called MayaAir the only commercial line in the Terminal 1 so you can travel directly through Cancún to Cozumel.\n\nBe sure to pass the customs before looking for money exchange - for example inside customs zone in Cancún they offer $9.6 MXN to US $1, which is much lower than even greediest street vendors ask.\n\nBeware of leaving Mexico with enough money. The Mexican Government charges a travel tax of around 500 pesos (US $45) to leave the country from the airport. Most major air carriers may already have the travel tax charged to the price of the ticket, though it is highly recommended that travelers check this before leaving to\/from Cancún. For example, Thomas Cook is charging 660 pesos, and U.S. dollars are not accepted. -- The current collective travel experience (from TripAdvisor) shows that almost all airlines flying from the US have already included this tax in their airfare, so there is no need to pay again when leaving Cancún. It seems that only charter flights from the UK do not include this tax and UK travelers may need to pay upon leaving.\n\nAlso beware of going through security too early. Food and drink prices almost double and you can't easily go back.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nDriving in Mexico can be an experience. For more information and tips refer to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["driving in Mexico"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nCancún's bus station is located downtown on the corner of Uxmal Avenue and Tulum Avenue. Destinations served by bus include most destinations up to Mexico City (26 hr).\n\nThe bus station is served by a taxi rank in front of the station. Local buses to the hotel zone pass regularly behind the station on the Tulum Avenue.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nCancún is very easy to navigate. To the South is the airport, to the North is the city and in between on the stretch of land between the sea and the Nichupte lagoon are all the hotels, beaches and bars, referred to as the hotel zone or ",{"type":"''","value":["Zona Hotelera"]},". Downtown is where most residents live and it stretches in on the mainland behind the lagoon.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nBus is the preferred way of getting around. Buses are cheap and come frequently. Most bus drivers are very courteous and will stop for you even if you are not waiting at a bus stop. After paying the fare, which is on a per person basis, the driver will hand you a ticket\/receipt which are usually printed with advertisements. Just so there are no surprises, do not expect buses to have amenities such as air conditioning and seat cushions. Also, most bus drivers speak enough English just to help visitors get around. \nA great resource for finding your way around Cancún are the Can-Do Cancún maps & Guides by Perry & Laura McFarlin.\n\nBuses head up and down the main thoroughfare, Blvd Kukulcan, named after the feather serpent which is the main Mayan deity, from the Mayan words ",{"type":"''","value":["kukul"]}," (bird) and ",{"type":"''","value":["can"]}," (snake). Buses pass constantly but be prepared for a cramped and rough ride. The rules for the bus drivers seem to be \"he who gets to the next passenger quickest, makes the most money\". Therefore, be prepared for a wild, but entertaining ride. Frequently, locals will get on with their instruments and \"entertain\". Some are quite good.\n\nWhen you are ready to get off, you can either push the button on top of the hand rail, or if you're not sure of your destination, tell the driver where you would like to get off or point to the destination using a bus map. Most bus drivers speak enough English to understand non-Spanish speakers.\n\nBe careful when the bus is full as pick-pocketing is a concern.\n\nCompanies serving the station include all attractions and towns along the coast: the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Riviera Express"]}," for the Riviera Maya (Playa del Carmen, Tulum, Xel-Ha, etc.) and ",{"type":"'''","value":["ADO"]}," for the major national destinations. For some Riviera Maya destinations, it's possible to stop the buses on the Tulum Avenue without having to go all the way to the station, however if you are unsure about where to catch the bus then it's best to go to the station.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\n\nTaxis are plentiful, a bit expensive for the hotel zone and airport, but cheap in the downtown area. Fares for the hotel zone depend on how far along the Blvd Kukulcan you want to go (fares available at hotel receptions and shopping centres), while within the downtown there is a general fixed fare of about 20 pesos per trip, it is best to just ask the driver upon boarding to avoid misunderstandings. By far, the best mode of transportation for the hotel zone is by bus. The bus fare is cheap and getting from Point A to Point B doesn't take very long.\n\nBe careful and clear with your taxista. They have set rates on paper for how much they should charge for the trip per kilometer (no meter). You can also obtain a discount about 10% if you ask. If you are splitting a cab with friends, be clear on the number of services, people, and price he will charge to your destination. If your friends get out before you he can charge you twice the amount you negotiated for just a few more kilometers. A \"service\" is considered to be from start point to a requested stop point. If your taxista is non-cooperative there are about 10 more taxis around every corner.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nBe very careful if you choose to drive in Cancún. The police seem to pull tourists over at the drop of a hat during spring break. When you pick up a rental, check that all the lights work. Also when you are pulled over for a light violation, do not be surprised if the police holds out an open palmed hand, while holding your driver’s license hostage in the other. Most police officers are underpaid and will for the most part demand a small bribe to let you off the hook.\n\nSee the related travel article ",{"type":"[[","value":[["driving in Mexico"]]}," for additional information.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:CancunPlage.jpeg"],["thumb"],["Cancún's Waters"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Interactive Aquarium"]},", Right in the middle of the hotel zone, this small but modern aquarium lets you get up close and personal with aquatic life.

Many of the native people of Cancún make a living by selling different items to the tourists on the beach.

Sunscreens that may be adequate elsewhere may not be sufficient in Cancún.\n\nBecause Cancún has powerful waves (see below), do not assume your sunscreen layer will remain intact.

As a rule of thumb, if you're not a strong swimmer (or a non-swimmer) it is best to stick to the hotel's pool for water fun.
