The coast roads are generally packed, and there are few ways to descend from inland. Locals do have some tricks, like the one described below, but they are complex and do not always work. Using the train to get in is probably better. You can park in Mougins or Mouans Sartoux and take the train to Cannes.\n\nThe obvious way to Cannes from the A8 Cannes\/Grasse exit is often extremely slow; you end up descending the Boulevard Carnot, which has an endless stream of traffic lights. The simplest way to avoid this congestion is to bear right immediately after you have left the A8 at the first traffic light. Then, once you are off the main road, get into the right hand lane and stay there as the road turns into a normal two-way road.\n\nAfter a sharp bend there is a traffic light. Continue straight on at the light. At the next major intersection (about 1 km further), turn left following signs to Cannes.\n\nYou are now on the N85; you should stay on it, and not follow misleading signs to other bits of Cannes until you are at the bottom (a T junction with a French Telecom building on your left). Probably the easiest thing to do at this point is to turn left at this T junction and almost immediately left again. Then go into the first parking garage you can (Parking Fontville).\n\nAnother way down to the coast (this works for both Cannes and Juan les Pins\/Antibes) is to go to Vallauris and descend to the coast on the D135 and then turn right (for Cannes) or left (for Antibes) when you get to the N7.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By foot"]},"\nWalking can quite often be the fastest mode of transport in Cannes. It also gives you the chance to stumble upon hidden sights that you may miss otherwise.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nGetting around Cannes is not a problem at all. The city is well equipped with an efficient bus system (the only public transportation available in town) that provides service not only in the city but also to neighboring La Bocca, Le Cannet and Mandelieu-La Napoule. The bus companies include STU de Cannes Bus Azur, Bus Azur, CTM Cannes La Bocca and Beltrame. They all have scheduled services with a frequency of a bus every 15 minutes. Tickets can be purchased on the bus or at the bus stations and cost €1 per ride or you can purchase a Carte 10 which gives you 10 reduced-rate tickets.\nBut be careful which fare you buy as buses in Cannes can be very expensive.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nTaxis can be hailed on the street or you can order them by phone calling Taxis de Cannes at +33 (04)929 9272.

Parking is generally not an issue. Although you will have to pay, it is recommended that you use one of the off street parking garages as this is far better than searching fruitlessly for a parking lot on the street. Moreover Cannes has a truly horrible one-way system and it is much easier to walk. The Fontville parking gives good access to the port and old town.\n\nIf you are more interested in the Croisette and\/or dislike walking, then there are other parking garages that are available, like the one by the station: one of the best is the one underneath the Palais des Festivales, and the one under the Grey d'Albion hotel in Rue des Serbes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:La Croisette.jpg"],["250px"],["thumb"],["left"],["La Croisette"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Old town"]},"— The usual narrow winding streets filled with restaurants and souvenir shops.
