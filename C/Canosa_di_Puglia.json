Its ancient name (Canusium) derives from Latin. (This does not exclude the presence of the greek name Canusion). With the barbarian invasions the name became Canuso and will then become Canosa, which is Latin for old man. But there are many legends that speak of the origin of the name of this city. This name is to emphasize that at the time Canosa was an important city like Firenze.Fu also an important center of comercio. During the Second Punic War between the Romans and Carthaginians, on 2 August 216 BC took place in Canne della Battaglia (then only cane for the presence of bamboo), the largest battle of the war. It was here that he saw the great strategic minds of Hannibal with the help of animals unknown to the Romans (the elephants) succeeded for the first time in defeating the Romans. The Romans, however, stu Canosa refuge where they were cared for in an old hospital (now middle school Bovio). The Romans were very grateful and made a splendid city of Canosa as Rome. (Canosa \"Little Rome\") is full of Canosa archaeological and even today continue to discover new tombs, archaeological sites and elements that bring us back to the past. Mainly the Etruscans \"provided\" the most valuable finds discovered in the graves. They believed that the dead were to continue their lives in another world and to help address this new life left in their graves at that time were objects of great value (pots, food, etc.). One of the most significant symbols of Canosa is the area of the castle. Many times we talk about a legend that says the Prince of Canosa and his family fled when he was in trouble Canosa. Some older people still hate the royal family and it is said that during that time the citizens of the land covered with waste and the castle. The castle is visible from a SRAD known only by people living in that area. Rise, however, only the walls.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Getting there"]},"\nPlane: Airports of Puglia, Bari Airport     \nTrain: Trenitalia     \nHighway: Highways in Italy    \nBus: Marino Marozzi    \nRegional Buses: STP, Ferrovie del Gargano, SITA    \nShip: Port of Bari    \n\n By plane \nInternational Airport Bari Karol Wojtyla known as Bari-Palese \nFoggia Gino Lisa Airport \n By train \nBarletta station for trains national, interregional and regional. \nCanosa station for the line Barletta-Spinazzola \n\n By car \nA16 Highway (Highway Two Seas) Naples-Canosa, about 172 km from Naples \nHighway A14 (Autostrada Adriatica) Bologna-Taranto, was 611 km from Bologna and 133 km from Taranto. \n By bus \n Bus service national and international \nMarino s.r.l \nMarozzi \n Bus-urban \nSTP S.p.A. \nFerrovie del Gargano \nSITA S.p.A. \n City buses \nCaputo \n By boat \nPorto Trani \nPorto di Barletta \nPort of Bari\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Cefalicchio Country House"],["url=http:\/\/www.cefalicchio.it\/en\/"],["email="],["address=Contrada Cefalicchio SP 143, km 3"],["lat=41.192138115417"],["long=16.041154861450195"],["directions="],["phone=+39 0883 642167"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=Farmhouse in Puglia with pool, restaurant, winery and wellness center, a few miles from Trani."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["41.2167"],["16.0667"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Barletta-Andria-Trani"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Canosa di Puglia"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Canosa di Puglia"]]}]
