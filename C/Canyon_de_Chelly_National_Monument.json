In several places petroglyphs (rock carvings) and cliff houses of the Anasazi can be seen.  The Navajo were living in the canyon when the Spanish first arrived in the 1700s.  The next century was marked by repeated conflicts with the Spanish and other Indian tribes, and later with the US.  Finally, in 1864, Kit Carson led a campaign to remove the Navajo to Fort Sumner. Cold and hungry, most surrendered and began the Long Walk to Fort Sumner. After four years of hardship, the Navajo signed a treaty with the US, which established the reservation.  Presently a few dozen families live in the canyon at least part of the year, farming and herding.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\nThe National Monument actually comprises three canyons.

With altitudes ranging from 5500 feet (1,524 m) on the canyon floor to 7000 feet (2,134 m) on the rim, it can be cold here in the spring and fall even when it is hot at lower altitudes.
