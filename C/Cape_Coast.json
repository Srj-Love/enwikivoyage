Arrange this with Moses specialist tourism personal in Ghana. Be warned that there is only one road from Accra, it is not in great condition, and is often very congested with traffic.\n\nSTC buses pull into the Goil Petrol Station (Pedu Junction), about 5km from the town centre. Buses from and to Accra (C5. 3hrs) and Takoradi (C3, 1hr) go twice a day. There is a daily bus to and from Kumasi (C5, 4hrs).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nTaxi is the best way and is very cheap by western standards. Especially shared taxis are very common in Cape Coast.\n\nYou can charter a vehicle in Accra with a driver who will take you to where you want to go.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Cape Coast Castle"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat=5.103605"],["long=-1.241116"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=one of several ",{"type":"[[","value":[["UNESCO World Heritage"]]}," slave forts along the southern coast of Ghana.

The money you spend is well worth it.\n\nTake a Global Mamas workshop on batiking, Ghanaian cooking, fishing, and\/or dancing. globalmamas.org\n\nIf there is a game when you're there, go see the Cape Coast Dwarfs play a soccer match in the stadium. Entrance fee is C3 and it's worth it! The level of play on the pitch may not meet European standards, but the enthusiasm of the fans surpasses those standards easily. Practically all spectators sing along in support of their team, encouraged by drums and other musical instruments. Do yourself a favour though: don't bring any valuables. There is always a risk of pick pocketing in large crowds and you will be feeling uncomfortable with a camera around your neck or your wallet showing through the bulge in your pocket. Do bring some petty cash though, as you probably will want to by some water after a while sitting in the burning sun. Also, little baggies with peanuts and other snacks are being sold by women (and some children...) walking up and down the stands. It can be great fun, although you could be intimidated by a hint of aggression that hangs in the air, but not like hardliners among the fans of some European or South American teams. Intriguing fact though: In the end of the match, the referee is escorted off the field.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\nEle Emma, a seamstress on Aboom Wells Road, makes high quality tailored clothes. Prices are approximately GHC20,00 (U$19,00 - Aug2008) for a shirt.\n\nDuring the tour of the Elmina Slave Castle, they bring you to a bookstore within the castle filled with reasonably priced books on the castle itself, slavery, important black leaders, and even some books on Ghanaian culture (the Ghanaian cookbook is worth a look). If you need more time to browse, return to this bookstore after the tour.\n\nCommercial Road has many great booths for small gifts-- one in particular has beautiful jewelery and beads. This, along with other stands along the road, offers better prices than the tourist stores in the Castle, and supports local economy.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nThe main street has many good eateries.\n\nCape Cafe on Commercial Road has great cheap food. With a friendly atmosphere, quick service, full bar, and a menu of both Western and Ghanaian food, it is a favorite of both tourists and locals.\n\nFurther along, just to the right of the fork in Commercial road (the crab monument), Ant's Rastafarian Health Food Store is a gem for vegetarians-- smoothies, veggie dishes, and even tofu are available there.\n\nThere is a restaurant inside the Elmina Slave Castle, but it's recommended that you eat elsewhere. The food is average, and you'll spend most of the meal swatting flies. \n\nWalk in the alley way next to the right of Malcom. Then make your first right into the smaller alley. Then your first left past the fruit stand. And you will find a hidden local market.
