American Indians began using the land at least 9,000 years ago.\n\nIn 1620, a group known as \"The Pilgrims\", a group of English Separatists seeking to establish a settlement in Virginia were forced to land here. They sent out three separate \"discovery\" expeditions to see what the area had to offer. During these \"discoveries\" they found their first fresh water, took some Indian corn, and almost had a battle (called the First Encounter) with some Native Americans. Cape Cod had many good features, but after a month of searching, it was decided to finally settle in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Plymouth (Massachusetts)"],["Plymouth"]]},".\n\nIn 1902 Guglielmo Marconi built one of two North American wireless stations at South Wellfleet. On January 18, 1903 the first public two-way communication (in Morse Code) between Europe and America occurred through this station. The station was closed in 1917 and scrapped in 1920, with the communication station being relocated to Chatham. Cable stations were later established in North Eastham and Orleans.\n\nSeashore history also includes shipwrecks and lifesaving. Two lighthouses (Highland or \"Cape Cod\" and Nauset) have been moved to keep them from toppling down eroding cliffs.\n\nThe Cape Cod National Seashore was created on August 7, 1961 by President John F. Kennedy.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\nThe park includes beaches, high cliff dunes, sand spits, tidal flats, salt marshes, and soft-bottom benthos.

Bayberry and beach plum are common.\n\nTwenty-five federally-protected species occur in the park. The Seashore is a significant site for the piping plover, with roughly 5% of the entire Atlantic coast population nesting here. Cape Cod National Seashore also supports 32 species that are rare or endangered in the state of Massachusetts. Some of these, such as the common tern, are conspicuous. Much less visible is the spadefoot toad which spends most its life buried in the sand, emerging only on warm nights with torrential rainfall.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nSpring is generally cool and damp with temperatures of 40°F-60°F (4°-15°C). Summer brings temperatures in the 70s and 80s°F (20-30°C), and cool nights. Autumn is drier than spring with similar temperatures. Winter is milder than inland, but dampness and wind chill can make winter days bitter cold.
