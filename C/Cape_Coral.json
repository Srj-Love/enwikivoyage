Myers"]]},", in Lee County Florida. Since it is a \"cape\" two points of entry are by bridge. There are four points of entry into Cape Coral Florida:  \n1. Veteran's Memorial Parkway Bridge \n2. Cape Coral Parkway Bridge (both bridges have a toll, the toll is reduced by 50% if you have a LeeWay transponder and are enrolled in the discount program. In fact, with the discount, the toll is as little as 25 cents during off peak times).  \n3. Pine Island Parkway\/ Bayshore Dr. from North Ft. Myers which is a free alternative. \n4. Get into the NW Cape via Burnt Store Rd., from Punta Gorda, in Charlotte County.\n\nIf you are flying you will likely either fly in by Tampa International Airport or Southwest Florida International Airport (RSW).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]}," \nSanta Barbara Boulevard divides the city into east and west, while Hancock Bridge Parkway (east of Santa Barbara) and Embers Parkway (west of Santa Barbara) divide the city into north and south. Thoroughfares going east to west are: Pine Island Parkway, Veterans Memorial Parkway, Cape Coral Parkway, and El Dorado Dr (listed from northernmost to southernmost).  The North and South are Del Prado, Santa Barbara, and Chiquita (taken from easternmost to westernmost).  The Cape is large and flat, areas are laid out far from one another; driving is a must. Cape Coral is the 2nd largest city in Florida by square mileage, so expect things to be spread out.   The southernmost tip has the largest concentration of businesses and homes.  A bike lane is provided and can be a handy way to navigate the SE and SW portions if you're inclined to be in those residential only areas.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Cape Coral Yacht Club Park"]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]}," \nMultiple beach accesses are one of this community's strong points.
