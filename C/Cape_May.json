It was the country's first seaside resort and much of the original flavor still exists in the properties and other sites within the city.  Settled by whalers and fishermen in colonial times, the town suffered a devastating fire in 1878 and was rebuilt during the Victorian period.  As a result, Cape May is known for its concentration of Victorian era architecture. It was declared a national historic landmark in 1976.\n\nA canal, dug from a natural shallow creek, runs from Cape May's harbor to the Delaware Bay, which makes Cape May an island. In fact, historically, it's known as Cape Island.\n\nThe two main industries within Cape May are tourism and fishing.  Cape May is second to Atlantic City for tourism in the state of New Jersey.  Being at the confluence of the Delaware Bay and the Atlantic Ocean allows Cape May full access to many types of fishing opportunities.\n\nCape May is also home to the Coast Guard Training Station.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nThe nearest large airports to Cape May are Baltimore-Washington International (BWI), in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Baltimore"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Maryland"]]},", Philadelphia International and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Newark (New Jersey)"],["Newark"]]}," International.
