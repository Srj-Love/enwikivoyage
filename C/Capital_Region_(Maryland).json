Rock Creek National Park is another reason why you would find yourself here—the long bike\/running trail is great. Much of it, though, is suburban sprawl that has covered all the once beautiful Piedmont Plateau, and does not constitute any kind of tourist attraction, although plenty visit on business.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Frederick County"]]},", while still in the capital's orbit, has a more rural character, as do northern parts of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Montgomery County (Maryland)"],["Montgomery County"]]}," and southern parts of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Prince George's County"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By plane "]},"\nUnless you use a private plane, you won't be flying directly into the Capital Region.

I-270 is a very convenient highway for traveling between Montgomery and Frederick Counties, and there's really no better way to go between the two. Unfortunately, there is an odd lack of east west routes other than the Beltway, which lends to the extreme congestion between Prince George's and Montgomery Counties (and the extreme ire that engenders in the hapless, motionless drivers). \n\nMany drivers unaccustomed to the Beltway find its banked curves with traffic going 65-75 miles per hour with little to no space between cars alarming and unpleasant to terrifying. A good tip for avoiding the Beltway in moving between PG and Montgomery Counties is to take the East-West Highway instead.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Metro"]},"\n\nThe fabled Purple Line, which would mimic the Beltway in connecting the suburban areas to one another, is always under proposition and discussion, but may never come to light in the face of fierce opposition by homeowners that it would displace.

Just to go from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bethesda"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Silver Spring"]]}," (which are practically adjacent), you would have to ride for an hour through D.C. on the Red Line. \n\nSo take buses instead if you are using public transportation. The bus system is quite good and comprehensive. Use the county Ride On buses to go from point to point within Montgomery County, and the WMATA metro buses in traveling in between the two inner counties.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nIn general, the Maryland Capital Region is not the type of place you visit for sightseeing—you visit it to see family, or on business, since it is a huge commercial and residential center. But there are a few odd sights to find off the beaten path. The largest is the Emerald Palace-like National LDS Temple in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kensington"]]},", which boasts a spectacular display of Christmas lights and nativity scenes during Advent every year. NASA's visitor center in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Greenbelt"]]}," is another great reason to venture forth from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Washington, D.C."]]}," for a Maryland attraction.

The Route 193 \"International Corridor\" near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Takoma Park"]]}," has a variety of immigrant-fueled cuisine -- everything from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["India"]]},"n to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Peru"]]},"vian.

",{"type":"[[","value":[["College Park (Maryland)"],["College Park"]]}," is acceptable for these purposes -- but only if you're under 25.
