A sleepy little place with a laid-back atmosphere, it is popular with Colombians, but is only just starting to put in an appearance on the Gringo trail; mainly because it is the last place on the coast with a DAS office where you can get stamped out of Colombia.\n\nIf you are passing through, Capurganá is a great place to spend a few days relaxing and savouring one of the few places left with no cars (there are no roads to Capurganá, so the only form of land-based transport there are horses or bicycles). It has a couple of small beaches (although with strong currents, so take care when swimming), and is a great place for snorkelling.\n\nThere are numerous hotels and restaurants scattered throughout the place, so there are plenty of options for the budget traveller (who are likely to arrive on the bone-shaking launches from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Puerto Obaldia"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Turbo"]]},"), as well as more up-market choices for those who can afford to fly in.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Plane"]},"\n\nCapurganá has an airstrip and tiny airport, from which a couple of companies provide regular and charter flights from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Medellín"]]},":\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["ADA"]},": has flights from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Medellín"]]}," at around 290,000 COP.
