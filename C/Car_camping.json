Trying to sleep in a parked car seldom results in a restful night's sleep.  If you plan to carry a tent with you and camp out, make sure you are camping somewhere it is safe and legal to do so.  Setting up a tent on private property or in a town of any size can easily attract unwanted attention.

Essentially, you can camp anywhere you can park, and most pickup trucks can easily handle dirt roads or other rough conditions that may be present where you want to camp.  Truck tops are usually made to your specific model of truck and are available from many after-market truck retailers.  Costs can be from $400 to above $1000.

Some conversion vans have RV amenities like toilets, showers or kitchens but are more compact in design.  The cost - often going well over $50,000 - is in the same range as a basic RV.
