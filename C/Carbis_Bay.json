Toilets and shop by the beach.\n\nYou can take the train from Carbis Bay and be in St Ives in less than 5 minutes, but the 20 minute walk is one that you must make at least once on your holiday. Take the path down the beach and across in front of the Carbis Bay Hotel, join the path up to the railway bridge. Cross over the bridge and take in the view across St Ives Bay to Trevose Head. Up the gentle incline until it levels off, take the lower path to enjoy the best views. Follow the road and around the corner you get the first dramatic view of St Ives (above), drop down to the beautiful Porthminster beach or enjoy a spot of lunch in the famous Porthminster Cafe. Past the lifeboat station you find yourself by the Harbour. A quick tour of St Ives would take you past Smeaton Pier to Porthgwidden beach, up to St Nicholas Chapel on the Island, drop down to the Tate at Porthmeor, then   find your way back through the cobbled streets, stopping off at the many art galleries along the way.\n\nPorth Kidney Sands is sometimes claimed by Lelant but is in fact a lesser known beach of Carbis Bay. Reached at low tide from Carbis Bay beach around Hawkes Point, Porthkidney stretches as far as the Hayle Estuary and is backed by sand dunes and unspoilt by buildings. The views across the beach to Godrevy create evocative images which have been the inspiration of many artists including John Miller. The coastal path from Carbis Bay past Porth Kidney House will reveal the old miners' steps which you can take down to Porth Kidney Sands at low tide, alternatively take the Headland Road coast path from Carbis Bay, past The Sea Urchin Apartments to get a higher perspective of these dramatic views. Approaching Lelant village, follow the signs to St Uny church and park nearby, the footpath takes you through the sand dunes along the beach to Porth Kidney Sands. These stunning views are across the Hayle estuary to Mexico Towans, Hayle Towans, Gwithian and Godrevy Lighthouse and back to St Ives.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Cornwall"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Carbis Bay"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Europe\/United Kingdom\/England\/Cornwall\/Carbis Bay\/"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Carbis Bay"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["50.19659"],["-5.46505"]]}]
