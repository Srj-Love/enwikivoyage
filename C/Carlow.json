A small town that's easily navigable by foot, it offers an attractive blend of scenery, history and modern attractions. It is in the northwest corner of County Carlow. It is located approximately 50 miles southwest of Dublin. The M9 motorway means Carlow is about an hour's drive from Dublin. The proximity of Carlow to Dublin helps to explain the massive growth the town underwent from 1995 until 2008. The river Barrow flows through the town from north to south. Carlow town predominantly lies on the east bank of the river. Graiguecullen, regarded as a suburb of Carlow, lies on the west bank of the river. Carlow is a pleasant country town with all the modern amenities both residents and visitors require. It's not a touristy town per se, but has some hidden gems. These include the Courthouse, Cathedral of the Assumption, and a quaint Railway Station. There are interesting pockets of Georgian architecture on Burrin St, and Montgomery St. Tullow Street which runs from west to east and Dublin St which runs south to north dictate the central layout of the town. Tullow st starts at the southern tip of Dublin St. Tullow st was traditionally the prime shopping street in the town. However with the emergence of shopping centres and retail parks, this has been diluted to a large degree.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nWith Carlow being the county seat, public transportation to County Carlow tends to be centred around the town itself. This makes the town the most accessible one in the county for those using public transport, making it easily accessible to visitors travelling along the east coast ot who arrive at Dublin Airport.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nCarlow doesn't have a public airport, but can be easily reached from Dublin Airport, the largest in the country - see the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dublin#Get in"],[{"type":"'''","value":["Get in"]}," section of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Dublin"]}," article"]]},".\n\nThe most straightforward way to get to Carlow from Dublin Airport is to travel by JJ Kavanagh \/ Rapid Express Coaches or by Bus Éireann - see the ",{"type":"'''","value":["By Bus"]}," section below.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\nIf you are travelling by car and you arrive at the sea port of Rosslare, Carlow town is about a 60 minute drive away. Those who leave the car behind can get the train to Carlow, however you will have to change services, usually at either Waterford or Dublin. More information and concise timetables are available from the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.irishrail.ie Irish Rail website"]},".\n\nIf you arrive at Dublin Port, you can either get the train direct from Dublin Heuston to Carlow, or you can travel by bus. Bus Éireann services depart from Busáras or you can get the JJ Kavanagh service, which leaves from its bus stop on George's Quay. Check out their websites for more.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Bus"]},"\nBuses arrive and depart from Carlow's coach park after 7AM each morning. This is located within the town centre, at the junction where Kennedy Avenue and Barrack Street meet. Before 7AM, some buses will arrive and depart from the bus stop outside Deane's newsagents, which is a short walk away on Barrack Street.\n\nA small fee-paying car park is located at the coach park, although this is rarely full, so finding a space shouldn't be a problem.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.jjkavanagh.ie JJ Kavanagh \/ Rapid Express Coaches"]}]},". Carlow is on the Waterford - Dublin route, which starts in Tramore, Co. Waterford and finishes at Dublin Airport. Along the way, it has 18 bus stops, meaning that Carlow town is easily accessible to those travelling from Counties Waterford, Kilkenny, Kildare or Dublin. Eight buses leave the airport daily, serving Carlow along the way, while nine buses make the return journey. At the moment, the last bus to leave the Airport for Carlow departs at 10:30PM, however new overnight services are in the process of being launched. A new 2:30AM night-time service is now available to take visitors from Carlow to the airport, while a 4:30AM service will launch in September 2007. Note that tickets for the overnight services ",{"type":"'''","value":["must be bought in advance"]}," from the office at the coach park, whereas during the day fares are usually collected by the driver.

Minor traffic jams are common, particularly around Upper Tullow Street. A small section of motorway (M9) opened in June 2008 which serves as a bypass for Carlow town - the previously frequent traffic jams on Barrack Street caused by Dublin-Waterford traffic have almost been completely resolved as a result.\n\nBrowne Street, Castle Street, Charlotte Street and Church Street all have a one-way system, as well as the area around the Courthouse. Lower Tullow Street is also one-way, while most of the street is closed to traffic completely from 8AM-6PM Monday to Saturday.\n\nCarlow has over 3,000 car parking spaces, so there's never a shortage. The majority are fee-paying during the day, and most of these must be paid in advance. Unlike other towns and cities  where 'parking discs' have to be purchased in shops (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Waterford"]]}," for example), parking tickets in Carlow are purchased from vending machines on the street, which have the time stamped on them.\n\nThere are two multi-storey car parks, the largest of which is located at Carlow Shopping Centre. The other is on Dublin Street. Patrons at these car parks are issued with tickets on the way in, which must be 'validated' before you return to your car.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nDue to recent government legislation, taxi fares are the same in every part of Ireland. Therefore, the price of a taxi will usually depend on the length of the journey, whereas before, a journey within the town boundaries was at a standard fare of €5. Some companies are exploiting a loophole in this legislation, and charge a minimum fare of €6 within Carlow town's boundaries,(you must sign a waiver form to allow this to happen otherwise you will not be insured in the taxi), although generally the cost of a taxi from one end of town to the other is about €5-8. Customers have the right to have all fares calculated by the taximeter and get a printed receipt at the end of the journey. You will need the receipt if you wish to make a complaint about the Taxi service.\n\nThe initial fee incurred by passengers is roughly €4. For the next 14 km or 40 minutes, each additional kilometre is about €1 or 40 cent per minute. The exact fares vary on the time of the day, and a €2 booking fee may be placed at the driver's discretion where taxis are ordered by phone. Second and additional passengers are €1 each. An exact breakdown is available on the Taxi Regulator's website ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.taxiregulator.ie"]},".\n\nCarlow's sole full-time taxi rank is located on Potato Market. With room for eight taxis, the small size of the rank has been repeatedly criticised, however recent measures have been introduced whereby loading bays are used as taxi ranks between 6PM and 8AM, so as to alleviate the pressure on taxi operators and provide extra facilities around the town overnight.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=A1 Cabs"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address=Lismard House, Tullow Street"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+353 9142020"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Bridgecabs"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.bridgecabscarlow.com"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+353 59 728555"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Carlow Cab Service"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address=4 Tullow Street"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+353 59 914000"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Carlow CO-OP Cabs"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address=1 Haymarket"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+353 85 1159705"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Park Cabs Tipp's Cabs"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address= Tolerton"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+353 87 244-0621"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nCarlow town is fortunate to have some excellent working examples of architecture from the 1700s and the 1800s, many of which are open to the public.

It was completed at a cost of £30,000 - a significant amount of money at the time. A Russian cannon sits in front of the building which was captured during the Crimean war in the late 1800s and then donated to Carlow. The building itself was restored in the 1990s, and the refurbished courthouse was officially opened in March 2002. Throughout the decades, the steps of the Courthouse have been used as a focal point for public occasions. An early example was in 1929, when the 100th anniversary for the granting of Catholic Emancipation was celebrated. Ireland hosted the Special Olympics in 2003, and in June that year, the Olympic Flame stopped at the Courthouse where live music and entertainment marked the occasion, before the town bid farewell to local athletes as well as guests from Bolivia, Slovenia, and Ohio, USA.

Its interior has been renovated several times over the years - the most recent refurbishment took place in 1997, which proved controversial at the time and even attracted the attention of Pope John Paul II.

A curious building which occupies a corner of Burrin St\/Kennedy Ave. Continuing up the hill you enter Dublin street beyond where Tullow St and Castle St meet. Along Dublin St, note Kehoe's Auctioneers housed in a lovely grey stone building. The Franciscan Friary is a fine broad building on the same side of Kehoe's up towards the Courthouse. Further along is the old library in a lovely Georgian themed building. The courthouse lies at the top of Dublin St. Keeping left of the courthouse you enter Athy Rd.

Further along Athy Rd is the Masonic hall on your right housed in a quirky buildings topped off with urns! Take a right and cut across by St Dympna's Psychiatric Hospital. It is a massive classical stone building. More impressive for scale than detail. After leaving the grounds of the hospital cross the road and continue straight along. You will see the Railway Station. It's worth the walk to the top of the road to enjoy this fine building. Double back and take a left onto Old Dublin Road. On your left is a group of fine three storey, single storey bay houses. Further along is St Leo's School in a neat Georgian building featuring some lovely wrought iron decoration. Just as the Courthouse appears on your right swing left onto College St. College St is long and narrow . Towards the Tullow St end is St Patrick's College set back from the street in its own grounds.
