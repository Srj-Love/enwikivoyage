The town's main attraction is the nearby national park, which is home to a massive underground limestone cave, claimed to be the most beautiful in the  world. If you're going there for the first time, rent an audio guide for $3; it has much more information than the boards (available in several languages). The deepest point of the cave is over 1500 feet below the surface, while the unguided tour descends to a depth of about 900 feet. More extensive ranger guided tours are available. The descent can be slightly taxing on the knees, so there's an elevator available that will take you down to a depth of 750 feet.
