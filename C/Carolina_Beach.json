The town has several restaurants, particularly Italian. \nOne thing to note is parking. There are free 2 hr parking spots available beside the road, so don't waste too much time in finding a parking. The best time to visit to avoid crowds is early September. The water is still warm (in the 80's) but since school has started, most of the tourists are gone.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Britt's Donuts"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Located on the boardwalk"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Rated by MSN as the second best donuts in the country.
