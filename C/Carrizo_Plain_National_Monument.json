The Carrizo Plain National Monument lies primarily within the historical territory of the Chumash people. The Salinian, who lived north of the Chumash along the coast to the Salinas Valley, and inland within the Coast Range, also visited the Carrizo, as did the Yokuts who lived in the San Joaquin Valley to the east. The presence of pictograph sites like Painted Rock and other Native American spiritual sites on the Carrizo Plain indicate that this region has long held special values to these people.  Their descendants continue to revere these places and visit them to conduct ceremonies and rituals.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\nThe park is perhaps most famous for its wildflowers - mid March to mid April is the usual time frame for wildflower season, but it is dependent on the weather and varies from season to season.  There are many factors, including temperature, rainfall and the timing of the two that determine which flowers bloom and their distribution in any given season. Every year is not spectacular and only a few flowers may prevail in some years.\n\nCarrizo Plain is home to many animals with sensitive status. Tule elk and pronghorn antelope have been reintroduced into the area and can be seen at various locations on the plain. Many raptors, including redtail hawks, golden eagles, kites, harriers, owls, and others can be found all year throughout the area. The California Condor has been reintroduced nearby and is occasionally seen over the plain.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nThe park is remote and no gas stations are nearby, so fill your tank before visiting.  The only reliable road through the park is Soda Lake Road, which bisects the 37 miles of the national monument from north to south.  Since only the northern eighteen miles of Soda Lake Road are paved most visitors choose to visit the park from the north via Highway 58.

(open seasonally)\n\nCamping in the monument is limited to 14 days within any 30 day period and 28 days per calendar year.  Make sure to call ahead and check to see if there are any fire restrictions in effect for the area if you plan on having a campfire or using any open flame.  Free campfire permits are required to use any stove, lantern, or to have any type of fire.  Campfire permits may be obtained at any area BLM office or Forest Service facility.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nBring extra water, food, and warm clothes. Summer temperatures can reach above 100Â°F (38Â°C) and winter temperatures can fall below freezing.\n\nKeep an eye on the sky and check the weather report.  Any amount of rain makes quite a few of the roads impassable due to clay and high salt content.  Avoid the Caliente Ridge Rd, San Diego Creek Rd, Simler-Soda lake Rd, and Selby Rd during and after rain; navigate other roads with caution and watch for mud holes and washouts.\n\nTell a reliable person where you are going and when you plan to return. Search and rescues for stranded or stuck motorists and off highway vehicle enthusiasts are common.\n\nWatch your speed.  Speed limits on BLM roads are 25 mph and 55 mph on county roads unless otherwise posted.  The Soda lake road is notorious for rollover accidents. Remember the average emergency response time is well over one hour.\n\nFill your gas tank before you come and keep in mind the closest gas to the monument will be Maricopa.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["San Luis Obispo County"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinepark"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["related"],["United States National Parks"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["35.191358"],["-119.792908"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Carrizo Plain"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["commons:Category:Carrizo Plain National Monument"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["dmoz:Regional\/North America\/United States\/California\/Travel and Tourism\/Parks\/National Parks and Monuments\/Carrizo Plain National Monument\/"]]}]
