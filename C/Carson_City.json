Its cause was advanced by local fraternal orders and businessmen, chief among them Abraham Curry, who bankrolled and oversaw many of Carson City's early developments.  Carson City was once home to an outlet of the US Mint.  The collectible \"CC\" Carson City coins were produced here from 1870-1893.\n\nWith several hidden surprises for the history buff, Carson City is a pleasant daytrip from nearby Reno and Lake Tahoe.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\n\nThe nearest international airport to Carson City is Reno-Tahoe International, 30 miles away via highway 395.
