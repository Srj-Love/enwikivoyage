The city has basically two main parts where tourists go: the walled colonial city (\"ciudad amurallada\"), which is truly amazing and has many fancy restaurants, clubs and hotels; and a long strip of hotel towers and condos fronting onto the beach, known as Bocagrande.

Some banks may exchange money, but the rates may not be the most convenient.  The easiest method for obtaining pesos is to use your debit card at an ATM machine.  Another option is to use a Cambio or curreny exchange kiosk, however, your exchange  rate will be a little higher than by using a debit card.  Using a credit card at the ATM machine will require you to use a PIN number, so contact your financial institution before your trip.\n\nThere is a large Citibank ATM location on calle Venezuela near Barrio San Diego that has a guard out front.

She owns several boats, will give you the best price, and most importantly her word. You can rent your own small boat for $700.000 or secure a seat for $75.000. Ask them before hand about the itinerary. Her company in particular has its own \"resort\" in the Rosario Islands. The resort is clean, nice and has good food for a reasonable price. Unfortunately, their beach access is limited and less than spectacular. Her boats will insist on taking you there, but you have a choice. \nPlaya blanca is by far the best beach, but it can be overwhelming with the locals trying to sell you their products.\nMore upscale destinations include the Baru Island and private resorts owned by the big hotels (Santa Clara, Santa Teresa).
