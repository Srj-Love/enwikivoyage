There she found a piece of rock in the shape of the Virgin Mary with a small child. She thought is was a doll and played with it. Later she took it home and put it in her room. The next day she returned to the same spot and again found a very similar representation. That evening she returned with it and went to put it with the first one she found. However, the first one was no longer in her room. On the third day she returned to play by the river and, again, found the Virgin. This time she ran right back to her room and again, found that the ones she had taken home were not there. She then reported this to the priest in Cartago. He went with her the following day and took the statue they found there back with him to the city. There he locked it in a coffer. The next day they returned to the river to find yet another (or same?) statue there. When he returned to check the locked coffer he discovered it empty. This was taken as a sign that a church should be built on the site the statue kept returning to.\n\nIt is believed by a great many Costa Rican's that it is this virgin that protects Costa Rica from natural disasters.

The priest only became all the more bitter and did everything he could to destroy his brother.  In 1577 during the celebration of mass on new years he saw his brother in the church.  That day he killed him with a knife.  In penance for the deed he build a church for the city of Cartago.  On the year it was completed an earthquake destroyed it.\n\nThe church has been rebuilt, but each time it was brought down by earthquake.
