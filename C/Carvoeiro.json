Carvoeiro, or more commonly known as Praia de Carvoeiro (although this is no longer its formal name), is a Portuguese civil parish\/freguesia in the municipality\/concelho of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lagoa"]]}," (Algarve), about 5 km south of the city itself (on the Atlantic Ocean), 14.12 km² in area with 2,784 inhabitant (2001). The population density is 197.2 people\/km².\n\nIt was created as a separate freguesia in 1985 and raised to the status of town on April 19, 2001.\nThis picturesque fishing village, with a long history of settlement, has grown over the last decades into the main tourist area of the concelho. It has a number of fine beaches protected by clifts.\n\nThere are traces of Roman habitation and naval activity in the area. There has also been a long history of pirate and enemy military assaults on the coast, and a number of naval battles here, most notably the battle in 1544 between a squadron of ships under D. Petro da Cunha, and the Turkish corsair (barbary pirate), Xarramet.\n\nAccording to historical sources, the name of the village derives from “Caboiere,” an old name for a hamlet of fishermen from the Islamic-medieval period. For most of its history, fishing was the mainstay of the local economy.\n\nCarvoeiro profited from the expansion of the preserving industry, like the surrounding freguesias, because it created many jobs and wealth at its prime.\n\nHowever, from the 1960s onward, tourism gradually became the economic base of the area, with many new hotels, apartment complexes, shops, roads, and a significant improvement in the infrastructure.\n\nCarvoeiro represents a particularly attractive option when it comes to tourism (beaches, Golf and water sports). The scarped coast, the water quality, the warm climate and the famous Golf Courses, offer the right conditions to make Carvoeiro stand out, as a quality destination for Portuguese and foreign tourists.\n\nWalking by the seaside while admiring the natural beauty and pieces of history (achitectonic patrimony, an ancient fortress and the Shrine of Nossa Senhora da Conceição), that remained in this location, is a great advise for those who like to relax and to contemplate the beauty of nature's work.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Map Coordinates"]},": 37°06′N 08°28′W﻿ \/ ﻿37.1°N 8.467°W﻿ \/ 37.1; -8.467\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Patron Saint"]},": Nossa Senhora da Encarnação (Our Lady of the Incarnation)\n\n(source:Wikipedia)\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["From Faro's International Airport"]},"\n\nAfter leaving the airport, take the EN 125 and follow the indications towards the Via do Infante Highway (A22), following the Portimão direction.When you reach the exit of Lagoa Sul\/Carvoeiro, take that exit which will take you back to the EN 125.
