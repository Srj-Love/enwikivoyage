[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["TT Banner.jpg"]]},"\nA ",{"type":"'''","value":["casa particular"]}," is a Spanish term that usually means \"private home\" but the term is recognized worldwide as private accommodation or private homestays in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cuba"]]},".

As all other types of accommodation in Cuba - such as hotels, camping and motels - were owned by the government, the term \"casa particular\" stated that this kind of paid lodging was privately operated. Cuban families, encouraged by the need to find new sources of income, offered friendly hospitality to please their guests.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Services and facilities "]},"\n\nAll rooms are clean, safe, upgraded to tourist standards and will generally fit the guests’ needs and expectations.

Food and drink may be supplied by a mini-bar (which often includes a small refrigerator) containing snacks and drinks (to be paid for on departure).\n\nAlthough it could be thought that a ",{"type":"''","value":["casa particular"]}," is a bed & breakfast do not assume that breakfast is included in the room price: Usually, you will be expected to pay an extra fee for it, unless it is explicitly stated otherwise.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Advantages over other lodgings "]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Happiness"]},":  The guest can quickly develop genuine Cuban relationships and become deeply involved in the culture of the country.
