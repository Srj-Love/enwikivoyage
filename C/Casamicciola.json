The name comes from \"Casa Nizola\" (Nizola's House) a Roman matron who could not walk anymore and who recovered by dipping her legs into the warm water of a stream flowing near her house. \nThe new centre is on the seashore, the most attractive beauties of Casamicciola are on the hills around. On the Sentinella, where the beautiful panoramic view make us understand why the european high society chose Casamicciola as holidays destination, there is the Bourbonic Geophysical Observatory. \nOn the border dividing from the municipality of Ischia, on Monte Rotaro, there are the Bosco del Castiglione (Castle's Wood) on the side facing the sea, and the Bosco della Maddalena (Magdalene's Wood) on the side towards inland. The latter is 45 hectares wide and occupies the whole Fondo d'Oglio between Monte Rotaro and Monte Cretaio.\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Ischia"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Casamicciola Terme"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["40.75"],["13.916666666667"]]}]
