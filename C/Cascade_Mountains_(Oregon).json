Nice campgrounds at the trailhead with small campground at summit for packers. For those with horses, riding is allowed here. At times the trail can get congested it's best to stop and let the hikers walk by. Also you will find trekkers with Llama's packing in camping gear, if your horse is the nervous sort the trails can get narrow at times.

You have wonderful views of mountains and lakes. There are a few trails you can choose from. Only difficulty is at beginning of ride with small narrow trail through large rocks. If worried about feet and legs on your horse I would suggest to get off and lead them through this spot. It's about 75 feet long.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Central Oregon"]]},", to the east"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Willamette Valley"]]},", to the west "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southern Oregon"]]},", to the south "]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Oregon"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["no Wikipedia link"]]}]
