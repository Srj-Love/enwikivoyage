[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.casperwyoming.info\/ Casper"]}]}," is the largest city and county seat of Natrona county, located in central-eastern Wyoming. The city occupies a valley created by the junction of the North Platte river and the Laramie mountains. Casper is the  largest city between Cheyenne and Billings, and between Rapid City and Salt Lake City. The city is the financial and administrative center for a vast region of Wyoming that encompasses some of the state's most important mineral producing areas, especially the oil and gas fields located nearby. If you're passing through the state, Casper is a likely choice for an overnight stop or as a place to find food and supplies before heading to the national parks in the state's northwestern corner or to the forests located to the southeast or to the north. \n\nCasper grew up around the ferries that enabled travelers on the Oregon and California trails to cross the North Platte River. The presence of settlers transiting westward and the growing presence of the US military made the region around present-day Casper a focal point in the late 19th century war against Native American tribes in the region, many of whom had suffered prior dislocation from the north and east as the US pushed the frontier westward. This conflict resulted in a military battle in which Lt. Caspar Collins perished. As \"Collins\" had already been used in the designation of Ft. Collins to the south, the settlement on the North Platte became known as \"Casper\" (changed from \"Caspar\" thanks to a clerical error).  In later years, the arrival of the railroad and the discovery of oil in nearby fields consolidated Casper's relative importance in the region. Today, the city is a commercial hub for the surrounding region, whose economy is closely tied to energy and mineral extraction business. Casper is the second largest city in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wyoming"]]},", after ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cheyenne"]]},". The city has a few attractions to entertain visitors for a day or so, but the real attraction lies in the surrounding areas, which include some of the state's most interesting historical and natural sites. Independence Rock, South Pass City, Ayre's Bridge, Castle Gardens and two national forests are within a 60 mile drive of downtown Casper. The Oregon and California trails once passed through the city and visibile signs of their presence can be found within a stone's through of the city's boundaries. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Natrona County International Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["CPR"]]},") ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.iflycasper.com\/"]}," Served by Allegiant Air to Las Vegas and Phoenix, Delta to Salt Lake City, and United to Denver. The airport has on-site car rental facilities and it's easy to arrange a pick-up by one of the many hotels that offer shuttle service. Taxi service is not always easy; if you want to arrange a pick-up, you can call RC Cab ((307) 235-5203)or Casper Cabs ((307) 234-8294) to arrange a pick-up. They'll wait outside after your flight. If you call when you arrive, expect a 20-30 minute wait. \n\nWhile it might seem unexpected in an airport this small, lines at security can be long. There is only one security checkpoint and flights to Denver and Salt Lake City seem to leave at the same time, making the otherwise underused airport seem crowded and small. It's best to go through security at least 30 minutes prior to scheduled departure. If you're lucky, your boarding pass will get a stamp from one of the security staff's extensive collection. Travelers report seeing Hello Kitty, Snoopy and various seasonal holiday greetings on their boarding passes, turning them into unexpected souvenirs.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nCasper is located at the intersection of Interstate 25, US Route 20\/26, and Wyoming State Route 220.
