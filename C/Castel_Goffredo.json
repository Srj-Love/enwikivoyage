The first human settlements date back to the Bronze Age (1800-1200 BC ), after which the area was inhabited in Etruscan and Roman times, according to some scholars, the famous Roman poet Virgil was born right here in this area. In the Middle Ages (from ' 800-1115 ), Castel Goffredo belonged to the County of Brescia and was called ",{"type":"''","value":["Castrum Vifredi"]},". In 1337, with the rise to power of the House of Gonzaga in Mantua, even the country was incorporated. Then took over the Visconti, again the Gonzaga and the Republic of Venice. From 1441 was finally passed to the lords of Mantua and stayed until 1708. At the beginning of the sixteenth century, this land was the capital of a small state Gonzaga, the Marquis of Castel Goffredo. In their magnificent court, the gentlemen loved to surround himself with famous people, such as writers Matteo Bandello and Pietro Aretino. In 1602 Castel Goffredo lost its autonomy aggregate to the Duchy of Mantua followed the fortunes, passing under Austrian rule (1707) and, in 1859, became part of the Kingdom of Italy. Recently (27 September 2002), the President of the Republic awarded in Castel Goffredo, the title of city: in this way was meant to \"reward\" the long history of this that at one time was the \"Magnificent Community\" as well as the resourcefulness of its people and characters that have made it famous. Among them, two examples are descendants of the family Acerbi Giuseppe Acerbi (1773-1846), explorer, scholar and Egyptologist, and Giovanni Acerbi (1825-1869), superintendent of the Expedition of the Thousand following Garibaldi.
