There are two lines: one goes to Frascati while the other connects Rome with Marino, Castel Gandolfo and Albano.\n\nThe Castelli is also conveniently reached from Ciampino airport (see ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rome"]]},") now used by a number of the budget airlines like Ryanair ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ryanair.com"]}," and EasyJet ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.easyjet.co.uk"]},". However, you may have trouble finding a taxi willing to take you in the opposite direction to Rome.\n\nThe area is easily reached by car. Avoid Sundays between April and September as the area becomes crowded. Leave Rome on the Via Appia Nuova or the Via Tuscolana. If you take the Appia turn left at the end of the Ciampino Airport runway and follow the Via dei Laghi (Road of the Lakes). You will pass Marino on your left and eventually find Lake Albano on your right.
