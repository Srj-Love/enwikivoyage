This charismatic town has much to offer any visitor including its beautiful medieval walls, beautiful churches, art treasures and numerous Renaissance structures - e.g. the Loggia by Vasari at the Piazza del Comune. \n\nCastiglion Fiorentino also has many festivals throughout the year including the famous \"Palio dei Rioni\", a horse race among the three ancient Rioni (boroughs) of the town (Porta Fiorentina, orange-green; Cassero, white-blue; Porta Romana, red-yellow) in Piazza Garibaldi, the largest square of the town, held on the 3rd Sunday of June, similar to the Palio of Siena. It includes a colourful and energetic display of the ancient custom of flag-waving - dating back to the 13th century (in the weekend preceding the horse race, a spectacular contest between the three groups of flag-wavers is also held). All these are extraordinary shows not to be missed. \n\nA splendid loggia by Vasari looks out onto the beautiful Valle di Chio - or Valle di Dio according to one of the Medici dukes after taking the town for Florence.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=La Pampa Ristorante"],["url=http:\/\/http:\/\/www.lapamparistorante.it"],["email="],["address=via Dante 23, Old Town"],["lat=11.92180"],["long=43.34181"],["directions="],["phone=+39 575 659 004"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Closed Mon-Tue"],["price=â‚¬35"],["content=This restaurant serves steaks and wine imported from Argentina, pasta and vegetables, but save room for the dessert of imported dulce de leche.
