The beauty of this agricultural landscape in Tuscany is the reason for its status, obtained in 2004, as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The historic centre of the village, of medieval origin, is situated at 540m above sea level and allows a marvellous view for kilometres.\n\nIn particular, you can look out over an imposing medieval defence tower rising out of the landscape \nat the Rocca di Tentennano, situated in the area of the \"Rocca d'Orcia\", just a stone's throw from the true centre of Castiglione d'Orcia.\n\nThe village's economy is based on two main activities: agriculture and tourism, and especially \nan activity which represents a combination of the two: Agriturismo ('agro-tourism,' where farms typically offer rooms and\/or meals from their own produce.) Within the boundaries of the municipality there are also some well-known hot springs: Bagni San Filippo. Tempted tourists can choose between private spas, which charge entrance, and the free, public ones.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Osteria Santa Caterina"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.osteriasantacaterina.com"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"Small restaurant specialising in \"Pici\" - a handmade Tuscan pasta dish; and \"bistecca alla fiorentina\" - steak from Chianina cattle, which originate in the area and is one of the oldest cattle breeds in the world.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Fattoria La Palazzina"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.fattorialapalazzina.net"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=In the countryside"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=Set amongst old cypresses and oaks, has a panoramic swimmingpool with breathtaking views over Val d'Orcia and beyond. 11 nicely decorated rooms and 3 apartments in Tuscan style.
