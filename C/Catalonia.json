Catalan is also spoken in Andorra, the Balearics, Valencia, La Franja (the eastern strip of Aragon), L'Alguer-Alghero (a small coastal city on the Italian island of Sardinia), and Roussillon (an area in the south of France sometimes called ",{"type":"''","value":["Catalunya Nord"]}," that corresponds roughly with the department of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pyrénées-Orientales"]]},"). In everyday use, 11.95% of the population claim to use both Spanish and Catalan equally, while 45.92% mainly use Spanish and 35.54% mainly use Catalan.

This is largely due to historical reasons, when the Catalan language was outlawed by the Franco regime as were other non-Castillian Spanish languages. Nevertheless, most locals are aware that Spanish is more widely spoken worldwide, and would be willing to speak to foreigners in Spanish. Replying in Catalan to a question asked in Spanish is the way to inform the other party that the conversation may continue in Catalan if desired. If you do not speak Catalan, just politely say that you do not understand, and there will be no problem in most cases. Spanish is the first language of 45.92% of Catalonia's population and 99% of Catalans speak the language fluently.\n\nAranese, a subdialect of Gascon (Occitan), is a minority language and only spoken by a couple of thousand people in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Val d'Aran"]]}," in northwest Catalonia.

They are organized by the people of a town for their own enjoyment, and not for any commercial interest. \"Festival\" (which also exists in the Catalan and Castilian languages) denotes an event that is usually organized by a specific group of people for a particular market, and is often motivated by economic interest.\n\n“Festes” have ritual like sequences of events that usually involve Giants, Devils, Human Castles and processions. A magical atmosphere is created at the “festa”, almost like a type of Catharsis. “Festes” stem from Medieval Times when fantastical dragons and Giants were created to instruct people about religion in church services. Shortly after the fantastical creatures became a part of the Corpus Christi processions that paraded through the town during the summer. The importance given to these folkloric elements has gradually increased over time and now they have assumed a national importance.

The most important sites are Cap de Creus, Aiguamolls de L'Empordà, Barcelona's Llobregat Delta, the Parc de Garraf, Ebro Delta, Steppes of Lleida and, of course, The Pyrenees.\n\nThere are a few companies that will organise tours for you, or even offer free advice, including Catalan Bird Tours and Oliva Rama Tours.
