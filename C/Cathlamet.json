This village of cedar houses included 300-400 inhabitants when visited by Lewis and Clark.\nIn 1846, James Birnie became the first permanent white settler at Cathlamet, moving there after a career with the Hudson's Bay Company. He set up a trading post, remnants of which were reported still standing in 1906.\nCathlamet was officially incorporated on February 18, 1907. In 1938, the Julia Butler Hansen Bridge was built to carry what is now State Route 409 across the Columbia River's Cathlamet Channel to Puget Island.\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=WA-4.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["directionl1=W"],["majorl1=Ends at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:US 101.svg"],["18px"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Naselle"]]}],["directionr1=E"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kelso (Washington)"],["Kelso"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Longview (Washington)"],["Longview"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Southwest Washington"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Cathlamet, Washington"]]}]
