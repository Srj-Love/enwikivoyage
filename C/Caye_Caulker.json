It's about 8.2 km (5 mi) in length with a population of 1,300 and counting.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nCaye Caulker is popular with backpackers and budget travelers for its (relatively) cheap prices, laid-back vibe, and abundance of restaurants and bars. There aren't really any proper beaches to speak of, but plenty of docks are spread around the island where you can pull up a plastic chair and get your sun on, or hang out at one of the ocean front restaurants or walk down to \"The Split\" which is a popular swimming area and if you're feeling a bit thirsty, The Lazy Lizard Bar is just couple steps away from the water.\n\nThere are only 3 roads in town, all sandy. Front Street runs along the east coast, Back Street along the west coast, and Middle Street exactly where you'd expect it. The vast majority of places of interest to a visitor will be found along Front Street and the west coast.\n\nThe local cultural influences are Mestizo, Garifuna and Creole.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nOn early British maps the island's name is spelled \"Cay Corker.\" Known historically for its plentiful supply of exposed fresh water at La Aguada, one theory holds that this island was a favourite stop for sailors to replenish and cork water bottles. The Spanish name of the island is Cayo Hicaco, which means \"the island of the cocoplum.\" \"Caye Caulker\" could be an anglicised pronunciation of Cayo Hicaco. Another theory is that boats were caulked in the protected bay, La Ensenada, on the western side of the island leading to the \"Caulker\" name.\n\nRecent history of Caye Caulker began when Mestizo refugees from the Mexican Caste Wars arrived. With few inhabitants, food could be grown with sustainable methods of agriculture. The coconut and the fishing industry became important economic staples of the island. Even today a few of the older women continue to process coconut oil for their own use and to sell, although generally the coconuts themselves are harvested and shipped to the mainland.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\n\nCaye Caulker Airport (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["CUK"]]},") is located at the southern end of the island.

Flights leave hourly from Belize City to San Pedro, and will stop here if there is demand.

These planes also leave from the Belize City Municipal Airport (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["TZA"]]},") and the cost is less.\n\nIf you're coming in from Mexico you can fly from Corozal, 20 minutes from the Mexican border at Chetumal.

With a golf cart, you can go around the entire island in 30 minutes.\n\nThere are many places on the island who rent bicycles.\n\nFor golf carts check with C&N Golf Cart Rentals and Caye Caulker Golf Cart Rentals.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Forest Reserve"]}," covers the northern 100 acres of the island.

The dive depth is normally described as 40 m (130 ft), but you may go a bit deeper than that. The dive shops typically combine the blue hole dive with two shallower dives afterward, so you'll only be able to stay down at that depth for 5-10 minutes. Once you're down there, you'll take a look at the formations and probably see a few reef sharks. There's not much to it other than that, so many divers regard the trip as being overrated. It's just one of those things you'll want to check off your list as a diver. That said, most divers enjoy the two subsequent dives on the trip.
