Example:  An average pair of sunglasses will not \"grow legs\"; But a flashy pair of Chanel knock-offs just might!\n\nSpecial note to women: Women traveling alone should be especially careful at night, as sexual assaults do occasionally occur. Carry a cell phone capable of emergency calls to local 911. If you feel you are being followed or inappropriately watched, you should immediately call the police. The RCIPS is a very responsive and extremely professional organization. They will take your complaint seriously.\n\nGrand Cayman is no longer a Camelot . But not to worry.
