This could lead to your wallet being slightly lighter than it was when you put it in at the beginning of your holiday, as you won't need it for the duration of the all-inclusive stay. Somewhat annoying if you choose to tip the cleaner and find out on the bus back to the airport!\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Jardines del Rey"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Cayo Guillermo"]]}]
