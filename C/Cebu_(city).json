It takes about 20-30 min to get to the actual city of Cebu. From the Airport you will need to hire a taxi or take a Jeepney.  If you are staying at one of the nicer hotels they usually can send a free van to pick you up at airport.  If you forgot to ask for this you may find that the van of your hotel is there to pick someone else up and you can hitch a ride if there is room. Facilities and amenities at the airport include a shopping center, duty-free shop, souvenir shops, cafés, business centers, food shops, communication facilities, banking facilities, car rentals, hotel and resort reservations, and beauty and health services. Taxi to town are about 200 PHP, but are the only options at night.\n\n",{"type":"=====","value":[" To Cebu City Center by Jeepney "]},"\n\nThis trip requires three steps: \n# Take the yellow multi-cab (similar to Jeepney) in front of the Departure Hall to the \"Save More\" supermarket at the highway.

To reach the highway, you continue walking for ca. 30 meters in the direction the multicab from 1. was driving, then, you cross the highway. About ₱10.\n# Take any Jeepney that brings you to the city center (e.g. line 01K, which goes via the North Bus Terminal to Colon Street). ₱7.50.\n\nNote: The whole journey takes quite a lot of time. It is ",{"type":"'''","value":["not"]}," known, whether you can do this trip with (a lot of) luggage as space in the Jeepneys is very limited and it can get very crowded. A smaller backpack was fine, though.\n\nThe Yellow multi-cub also goes from the Cebu Airport (in front of the International departure hall) to the ferry Port in Lapu-Lapu for php8.\n\nFrom the Lapu-Lapu port there is a ferry to pier 3 in downtown Cebu (php14, plus a port fee of php1). The ferry goes every 20 mins in the daytime and takes 20 mins, a nice way to get from Cebu airport to downtown Cebu city for only php23.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By boat "]},"\n\nCebu City's domestic port is the country's busiest. Cebu City is home to almost 80 percent of the country's passenger vessels. The country's largest shipping lines,  namely 2 GO Travel, Trans-Asia shipping lines, George & Peter Lines, Cokaliong Shipping Lines, Lite Shipping Lines, Super Shuttle Ferry, Kinswell Shipping Lines, Roble shipping lines, Montenegao Shipping lines, Weesan Express all depart from Cebu island.\n\nLarge passenger ferries with a capacity of 2,000 to 4,000 passengers ply the more distant routes such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Manila"]]},",",{"type":"[[","value":[["Butuan City"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zamboanga (city)"],["Zamboanga"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cagayan de Oro"]]},".

Simply ask around for which route to take. They are available 24 hr and cover most of the nooks and crannies of the city. Cebu Airport to Lapu Lapu City (LLC) costs about ₱8, while across the bridge to Mandaue or Cebu City costs from ₱10.  Be sure you know what part of the city the jeepney will take you to.  Additionally be aware of pickpockets and other theft, this is common and even locals fall victim.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nBuses are also available but these tend to ply exclusively along the north-south route.  There are two major bus terminals as the name implies for direction of travel - North Bus terminal at Mandaue and South Bus terminal.  Ceres Bus lines operates regular bus services from these terminals and are considered the \"safer\" alternative to the smaller privately operated bus lines.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\n\nTaxis are ominpresent in Cebu City.  Sadly, there's a decent chance you'll be overcharged by a taxi driver at some point during your trip to Cebu.  This should be considered an unfortunate cost of visiting Cebu (or anywhere in the Philippines).  You can (and should) report improper taxi behavior to the Department of Tourism in Cebu by phoning +63 32 254 2811.\n\nUnless you're familiar with the city, always insist on a metered fare as a negotiated fare will almost always be much higher.  If you know the city and need to go a long distance, it may be worth paying a negotiated fare so that the driver doesn't take the scenic route or you become victim of an uncalibrated meter.  Late in the evenings, there could be taxis driving with an uncalibrated, inflated meter.\n\nMost trips around the city should not cost more than ₱100.  The fare from the airport to most of central Cebu should be ₱200-250 depending on whether you use the white or yellow cabs (white ones are reportedly cheaper).\n\nIf you know the name of the building, establishment, area or street you wish you reach, taxis are still the fastest way to your destination.  Most drivers know where almost everything is.  If the driver is pleasant, a ₱10-50 tip is warranted, especially if he loads or unloads your bags.  Most drivers do not have, or will tell you they do not have change, so be ready with 50's and 20's when going on short trips.\n\nIt is best to avoid the \"Private\" taxis as they take advantage of tourists and charge 5-10 times the normal fare. You will find these taxis at the some of the high-class hotels.  They are normally owned by the hotel to make money and may charge ₱500 for something that should cost ₱60. Some hotels make it hard for other taxis to pick you up at their premise and you may need to walk outside to save money.\n\nAnother place where private taxis are common is the airport.  To avoid them, simply ask a porter for help and for a metered taxi. Downstairs at the exit for arrivals, there is a booth that will flag down a taxi for ₱70, but you can also go up the ramp and there are a large number of metered taxis waiting for you. You can also wend your way upstairs to Departures where many metered taxis are available. Fare down town to Ayala or SM Malls should be around ₱150 on the meter. You may be told \"",{"type":"''","value":["500"]},"\" by the driver. Just grab the door handle and say \"",{"type":"''","value":["What, you don't have a meter?"]},"\" Don't travel unless the meter is used; not using the meter is illegal, and you can report it to local officials.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" See "]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["cautionbox"],["Some churches and landmarks were heavily damaged in a 15 October 2013 earthquake; the bell tower of the Basilica of Santo Niño is no longer standing.",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/world\/philippines-earthquake-death-toll-rises-to-144-1.2074202"]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Shrines and historical landmarks"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Basilica of Santo Niño"],["alt=Basilica del Santo Niño (Basilica of the Holy Child)"],["url=http:\/\/www.basilicadelsantoninodecebu.org.ph"],["email="],["address=Osmeña Boulevard"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+63 32 2556697"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=₱10"],["content=A large and venerable church that traces its history to the founding of the convent of the Santo Niño de Cebu in 1565.
