In the 1920’s Iron and Kane Counties worked together to have a road constructed from Cedar City to Highway 89.  A paved road up to Cedar Breaks was also built. President Franklin D. Roosevelt named Cedar Breaks a National Monument on August 22, 1933.  The monument is managed today by the National Park Service. In the summer of 2006 parties have worked to have this outstanding monument become a National Park.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\nImpressive!  Cedar Breaks is one of those places that is breath taking.  The single amphitheater is filled with shapes and the subtle colors of limestone formations that are incredible.  Surrounding the amphitheater are high alpine meadows covered in an array of wildflowers.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\nYou would think the place would be filled with Cedar trees, but there is not a one in sight.  Instead there are juniper trees that the early settlers mistook for Cedar trees.  This is a high elevation monument however and although there are junipers, there are many more aspen and spruce.  Due to the spruce beetle however, a live and thriving spruce tree is becoming a rare sight. The fir beetle has been doing some damage on the mountain lately as well. The bristlecone pine and fir trees dots the landscape in many places in the monument.  The bristlecone is thought to be the oldest living thing in the world even though the Aspen, according to some scientists, might just be older.\n\nAt 10,000 feet the fauna living on the mountain must be hardy.  Seen around the monument are deer, squirrels, chipmunks, pika and gophers.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Cedar Breaks National Monument partially.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Cedar Breaks"]]},"\n\nA cool, alpine climate.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nCheck road reports before heading to Cedar Breaks in late fall and winter.
