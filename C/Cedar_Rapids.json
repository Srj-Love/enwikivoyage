[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Cedar Rapids, Iowa banner.jpg"],["First Avenue Bridge"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Cedar Rapids skyline.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["right"],["Downtown Cedar Rapids"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cedar-rapids.org\/ Cedar Rapids"]}]}," is a city in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Eastern Iowa"]]},".  In 2000, it was the second largest city in Iowa by population and is home to approximately 126,000 residents. Largely known as an industrial, working class city, Cedar Rapids has recently begun to grow and expand employment opportunities in the service sector, attracting new residents to the area.  While out of the way of most major travel routes and destinations, a stop in Cedar Rapids may uncover a great taste of the Midwest.  Typical Iowa hospitality is not lost here.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nCedar Rapids is on I-380, about 20 minutes north of I-80.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Eastern Iowa Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["CID"]]},") ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.crairport.org\/"]},", approximately 5 miles south of downtown, is served by five airlines.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nAll addresses in the city are based upon a quadrant system.  The system divides the city into four directional quadrants with addresses that may look something like this:\n\n",{"type":"''","value":["500 33rd Ave SW"]},"\n\nThe quadrant system's base is the insection of the Cedar River and 1st Avenue.  Although seemingly simple to an observer, this system is nearly useless to visitors since the intersecting lines essentially form an \"X\" on  a map rather than a \"+\".\n\nAlso, visitors should note that along I-380 (North\/South interstate corridor) and the surrounding downtown area, traffic cameras are utilized to enforce speed and red-light laws. The Cedar Rapids Police Department (CRPD) has suggested that no additional cameras will be placed, although this hasn't been confirmed by any other agency. The photo-enforcement begins at various speeds over the posted limit, but you generally will not be cited for speeds between 1 and 8 over the limit on the interstate. Lower tolerance is used on city streets, and fairly strict enforcement applies to red-light violations.\n\nDriving in Cedar Rapids can be a hassle compared to cities of similar size. First, major thoroughfares (1st Avenue, Collins Rd., Blairs Ferry Rd., and Edgewood Road) have traffic lighting patterns that are inefficient. You will likely feel as if you're \"catching every light.\" Although this is true in many cities, Cedar Rapidians agree that it is decidedly worse here. Additionally, the roads are insufficient for the volume of traffic during peak travel hours. This means that the city becomes a rolling traffic snarl for an hour around high-traffic areas (Lindale Mall), and the traffic backup rivals that of larger cities.\n\nIf you happen to travel in the adjacent city of Marion, be aware of the posted speed limit. Rumors of excessive enforcement are exaggeratedâ€”but only slightly! The speed limit inconspicuously drops to 20 mph on major roads, and the Marion Police Department is all too happy to cite unfamiliar vehicles.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Cedar Rapids Downtown District"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.downtowncr.org"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Cedar Rapids History Center"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.historycenter.org"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Cedar Rapids Museum of Art"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.crma.org"],["email="],["address=410 Third Ave SE"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone =+1 319 366-7503"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Features collection of works by Iowa natives Grant Wood and Marvin Cone, along with a collection of 21 Roman portrait busts."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Cedar Rapids Science Station"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.sciencestation.org\/"],["email="],["address=4444 1st Ave NE"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Suite 410B (Lower Level of Lindale Mall), ",{"type":"''","value":["+1 319"]}," 363-7836 Science museum.
