[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["TT Banner.jpg"]]},"\nA ",{"type":"'''","value":["cemetery"]}," is any place with graves, tombs and memorials.  In some cases royal memorials and tombs may be the central point of vast grounds that might not always be known as a cemetery as such.\n\nSuch sites are extensively visited for a wide range of reasons, depending on local culture, they might be pilgrimage sites as well.  Some cemeteries in built up areas have massive walls and fences for protection from vandalism.  In earlier times the walls and structures surrounding may have been built in relation to beliefs about things leaving the cemetery, as much as entering.\n\nThe ",{"type":"[[","value":[["leave-no-trace"]]}," principle is the same as for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["archaeological sites"]]},". The legal consequences for trespassing in restricted areas, damaging graves, or souveniring artifacts from graves, might be harsh. Respect the laws and regulations of local authorities.\n\nSome cultures have very distinct beliefs about how or how not to visit graves, and it is well worth checking out acceptable practices.  For instance some places have strict rules on not walking over or touching a grave or its coverings.  Also some cemeteries that have custodians or caretakers request specific clothing to be added or removed by visitors according to local traditions.\n\nSome cemeteries have museums, organised tours and guidebooks for tourists to find the graves of famous and significant people.\n\nMany older cemeteries and grave sites are archaeological sites as well.  \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nThere are limited ranges of cemetery souvenirs: usually guide books.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Famous cemeteries"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Africa"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Egypt: City of the Dead (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cairo"]]},")"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Americas"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Argentina: Buenos Aires - ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Buenos Aires\/Recoleta"],["Recoleta cemetery"]]}]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" United States:"]},":*",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Arlington (Virginia)"],["Arlington"]]}," National Cemetery"]},",\n:*",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site"]]}]},".\n:*",{"type":"'''","value":["Saint Louis Cemetery"]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Orleans\/Tremé"]]},", three cemeteries with 18th and 19th century aboveground tombs.\n:*",{"type":"'''","value":["Woodlawn Cemetery"]}," (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bronx"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New York City"]]},").
