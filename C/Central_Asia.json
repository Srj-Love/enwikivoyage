That has all changed, although the traveller will still often come up against a wall of Soviet-style bureaucracy. Corruption is also an issue in most Central Asian countries. Despite this, Central Asia is increasing in popularity amongst travellers who want to experience one of the world's last great frontier lands. \n\nHistorically and geographically diverse, Central Asia is an interesting region. At one time large parts of it were part of the old ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Persian Empire"]]},". As a bridge between Europe and Asia, the region was the home of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Silk Road"]]},", the ancient trading route between the two continents in the first centuries of the common era. The following millennia saw much upheaval and conflict, from the expansion of Islam, the period of Mongol domination and the 'Great Game' between imperial Britain and imperial Russia in the 19th century. \n\nAfter a traumatic break-up from the USSR, Some Central Asian countries are beginning to find their feet and offer good travelling options. There are parts of Central Asia that will have hardly seen a traveller before, and there are many wild and beautiful landscapes to be explored. That is not to say the region is bereft of problems, chiefly a lack of infrastructure and stifling bureaucracy.\n\nUnderstand that self-identification is an especially touchy issue in Central Asia, more so than most of Europe. Parts of China (Notably ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Inner Mongolia"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tibet"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Xinjiang"]]},") have a native population that has in many instances advocated for secession from China. Often they emphasise their Central Asian identity, something not well-understood by outsiders. For example,  Mongolians and Buryats tend to emphasise their historical ties with the Turkic Muslims to the west (despite being Mongolic Buddhists of the Tibetan Rite) and are offended by being compared to the Chinese, and some even call themselves Europeans (by virtue of Russian influence).\n\nThis situation is not unique to Mongolic peoples; Tibetans are well known in the West for their disdain for China and any ties they may have to it. Many people in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tatarstan"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Xinjiang"]]},", among other places, would emphasise their Turkicness over any connection to China or Russia.\n\nThe problem goes the other way as well. Many ethnic Chinese are quick to point out that the Manchu Empire included parts of Central Asia, including land no longer controlled by the Chinese.\n\nAll in all, Central Asian identity is greatly shaped by their nomadic nature. From Kyrgyz to Tibetans, a history of tribal politics have left Central Asia at once totally isolated from the outside world, and intimately connected to whoever conquered them.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nMost of Central Asia (especially by the Soviet definition) speaks a Turkic language. The Turkic languages are a very broad group, and while some are mutually intelligible (depending on your level of proficiency), many are not. \n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mongolian phrasebook"],["Mongolic languages"]]}," (while arguably related to Turkic ones) are not comprehensible to the speaker of any Turkic language.

One reason why the one used on this page is useful, however, is visas.\n\nAll Central Asian countries except for Kyrgyzstan require ",{"type":"'''","value":["visas"]}," for a lot of countries, and the difficulty of getting them may range from a minor hassle to virtually impossible if not on a tour or with a guide. Before issuing a visa, some countries will require a ",{"type":"'''","value":["letter of invitation"]},", often best obtained via a specialist travel agency.  Some hotels will issue letters of invitation for confirmed reservations.  Some nationalities may be excluded from the requirement to have one at all.
