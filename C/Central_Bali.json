The entrance is signposted from Jalan Raya just west of the main market. When it opened in 1954, this was the first private museum in Bali. There are three buildings showcasing traditional and modern Balinese art (mostly paintings and sculpture). Apart from anything else, visitors will find a visit here very helpful in understanding the different schools of art in Bali as there are exhibits dedicated to several of the main categories.  Perhaps the most noted artists with works shown here are I Gusti Nyoman Lempad and Rudolph Bonnet.  The latter was instrumental in the setting up of this museum and made several donations of his work.\n\nIn Pengosekan village on Jalan Hanoman 1 km east of central Ubud, you will find the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Agung Rai Museum of Art"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["ARMA"]},")",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.armamuseum.com\/"]},", Tel: +62 361 975742. This impressive museum, library and gallery is the brainchild of leading art dealer Agung Rai and it showcases works by well known Balinese artists as well as international artists who made Bali their home such as Walter Spies, Adrian Jean Le Mayeur, Rudolph Bonnet and Arie Smit. The only painting in Bali by renowned Javanese artist Radan Saleh is exhibited here.

NEKA is in the village of Kedewetan about 3 km west of central Ubud on Jalan Raya Campuhan. \nOpened in 1982, no less than six pavilions house the various collections which include dedicated rooms for artists Arie Smit and I Gusti Nyoman Lempad. Entrance is Rp 20,000, open daily from 9AM-6PM.\n \nThe areas immediately around Ubud have much to offer in terms of art and each village seems to specialise in a particular artform or craft.

Inside are some fragmentary ",{"type":"''","value":["lingam"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["yoni"]}," (phallus and vagina) statues, as well as a statue of Ganesha. Statues stand guard around pools near the entrance. A number of the relics here strongly indicate that the site has a Buddhist as well as Hindu past. Despite its great antiquity some parts of the Goa Gajah complex were not excavated until the 1950s. Tentatively nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Entrance fee is Rp 6,000 and the complex is open daily from 8AM-4PM.\n\nNearby are the far less well known rock carvings at ",{"type":"'''","value":["Yeh Pulu"]},". These date to the 14th or 15th century and are in a very attractive rice field setting. You can reach Yeh Pulu on foot through the rice fields from Goa Gajah but you will definitely need a guide for the 45 minute walk as there is no path to speak of. Alternatively turn off the Ubud to Gianyar main road about 400 metres east of the entrance to the Goa Gajah complex. Drive through Banjar Batulumbang until the road comes to an end. For here walk down the track to Yeh Pulu passing the small warung on your left. As well as the carvings there is a holy well here and the attendant priest will be happy to bless you with the well water.  Temple dress code applies here. Yeh Pulu is a much under-rated and under-visited site - highly recommended.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:TirtaEmpul.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["300px"],["The bathing pools at Tirta Empul"]]},"\nThe historically important area of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Tampaksiring"]}," is about 20 km northeast from Ubud town centre.  300 metres north of the bemo terminal in Tampsaksiring on the main road, the entrance track to ",{"type":"'''","value":["Gunung Kawi"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["poet mountain"]},") is signposted.  Dating from the 11th century, this is presumed to be the burial complex of King Anak Wungsu and his many wives. Reached by climbing down 371 steps, the location at the bottom of the steep Pakrisan River valley is stunning. The smaller complex on the south side of the river is presumed to be for the king's wives, while the larger complex is thought to be for the King himself and perhaps his favourite concubines. About one km downriver there are further tomb cloisters. On the way back up, take a break at Cafe Kawi, which has cold drinks (Rp 10,000 & up) and fresh breezes (free). Entrance is Rp 6,000, open daily 8AM-4PM except during major religious hoildays.\n\nAbout 500 metres to the north, off the main Tampaksiring to Penelokan road, is the temple complex of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Tirta Empul"]},". This splendid temple dates back to the 10th century and is one of the holiest in Bali. Bar a few relics though, most of what you see is a modern replica. The site was built around hot springs that still bubble in the central courtyard. This is a very important sacred site for the Hindu Balinese who come here to cleanse themselves physically and spiritually - a process called ",{"type":"''","value":["melukat"]},".

A beautiful temple in a truly stunning setting. Open 7AM-5PM, daily and the entrance fee is Rp 5,000.\n\nAbout 1 km back up the hill from Lake Bratan is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bukit Mungsu traditional market"]},".

There is also an informative library and gift shop. Open daily 8AM-6PM, admission price Rp 6,000.
