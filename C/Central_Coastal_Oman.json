The partly concreted path winds past a falaj (irrigation) system, palm plantations and villages, and steep rock faces. Eventually the concrete disappears and it is necessary to do some scrambling before emerging to a series of inviting water pools. A hidden cavern can be visited by swimming through the pools, accessible only by swimming underwater for 1-2 metres. Plan on three hours for the round trip.\n\n:Occasionally after winter rains the pathway will be washed out in sections and therefore trickier to follow.
