Two of the most important political units in the region were the German and Austro-Hungarian empires. They were preceded in the Middle Ages by the Holy Roman Empire, a patchwork of states and statelets whose extent varied over time. Ethnic conflict was a major problem for hundreds of years in Central Europe and culminated in the horrors of the Second World War. With the peaceful reunification of Germany and the recent expansion of the EU to encompass the former Warsaw Pact states in the region, this problem finally seems to have been solved.\n\nIt is a common mistake by outsiders to label all the former Warsaw Pact states in the region as being in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Europe"],["Eastern Europe"]]},". Almost uniformly, inhabitants of Central Europe will be flattered and pleased if you correctly describe their countries as \"central European\" both geographically and culturally. Conversely, they may be upset if you lapse into Cold War stereotypes. East and West Germany ",{"type":"''","value":["were"]}," countries, so better to call it eastern and western Germany. Reunification is all but a thing of the past and seen in a more or less positive light by most there and in all of Central Europe so try to avoid labeling Germans by their recent past. Remember Germans are Germans but Austrians, Liechtensteiners and most Swiss and Luxembourgers all ",{"type":"''","value":["speak"]}," German, but are not German! Czech, Polish or Slovakian may sound similar to Russian, but inhabitants of these countries will not take kindly to assumptions of cultural overlap. Lastly, keep in mind that the Czech Republic and Slovakia once shared a country as well and Slovaks in general are very proud of their new found independence.\n\nWhile they are not currently considered part of Central Europe, the regions of western Ukraine, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Transylvania"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kaliningrad Oblast"]]}," (Russia), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alsace"]]}," and parts of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lorraine"]]}," (France), and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South Tyrol"],["South Tyrol\/Alto-Adige"]]}," province (Italy), are sometimes also considered Central European. This is due either to their current and or past ethnic makeup and\/or previous political histories. The Kaliningrad oblast spent most of its history as a German speaking region and South Tirol remains a largely German-speaking region in northern Italy maintaining strong cultural ties to Austria. Even though Ukraine is predominantly an orthodox country, its westernmost part for the centuries was part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and later passed to Austria-Hungary which to some extent influenced it's unique culture.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nCentral Europe, because of its rich heritage of nationalities, likewise is home to many languages. Some languages enjoy national status and thus are taught in schools and used widely in the media. Others however are only regional languages or minority languages and thus are sadly in danger of eventual extinction even though efforts are underway to try to preserve them.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["German phrasebook"],["German"]]}," has the largest number of native speakers in the region and acts as the single \"official\" language of Austria, Germany and Liechtenstein. In Switzerland, German is the mother tongue of 2\/3 of the population and the dominant language of the four official Swiss languages (German, French, Italian & Romansh). There is a small German speaking minority to be found in Poland, Czech Republic and Hungary. It is also spoken outside Central Europe in eastern Belgium and France, and northern Italy (mainly in the region of South Tyrol\/Alto Adige). German can be very diverse and appears in many different colorful dialects particular in the Southern German-speaking world (Southern Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and South Tyrol) were tradition and dialect remains strong.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Czech phrasebook"],["Czech"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Slovak phrasebook"],["Slovak"]]}," are very closely related and are mutually intelligible. The ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sorbian"]]}," language(s) spoken in eastern Germany near the Polish frontier is also a close relative. \n \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Polish phrasebook"],["Polish"]]}," is the dominant language in all regions of Poland. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kashubian"]]},", a regional Slavonic language, is spoken in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pomeranian Voivodeship"],["region"]]}," around Gdansk in Pomerania in northern Poland. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Silesian"]]}," is a regional language\/dialect, (depending on who you ask) found in southwest Poland.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hungarian phrasebook"],["Hungarian"]]}," is one of the most difficult languages for other Europeans to learn, as it originates from a different language family and is related to Finnish and Estonian. There are 5 million Hungarian speakers living outside Hungary in neighboring countries such as Romania (Transylvania), northern Serbia, eastern Austria and southern Slovakia. \n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["French phrasebook"],["French"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Italian phrasebook"],["Italian"]]}," are spoken by the majority of the population in the southern and western regions of Switzerland, while German is commonly taught as a second language. Similarly, German-speaking Swiss often learn French as a second language. French plays a historic role in alpine northern Italy in the French border regions.\n\nIn the Swiss Canton of Graubünden or Grison, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Romansh"]]}," is spoken as a regional language. Almost all Romansh speakers speak either Swiss German and\/or Italian as well. It is closely related to Ladin which is spoken in a few mountain valleys of northern Italy and is another endangered regional language. Sadly it is being replaced by German or Italian.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Slovenian phrasebook"],["Slovenian"]]}," is the official language of Slovenia, but it is also spoken by the Slovenian minorities in southern Austria, northeastern Italy and western Hungary. There is also a small ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Croatian"]]}," minority in Austria's Burgenland. Sorbian, Frisian and Low German are Germany's three native minority languages with exception of Roma. Sorbian is related to Polish and Czech and can be found spoken in both the eastern states of Saxony and Brandenburg. All Sorbs speak German as well and the current Minister President (Governor) of the German federal-state of Saxony is even Sorbian! Frisian is related to English and Dutch and is spoken by tiny minority communities in Schleswig-Holstein and Niedersachsen and neighboring communities in the Netherlands. \n\nLastly, Low German is spoken by rural communities or as a second language by a few in most federal states of northern Germany and still has a significant role to play in the city states of Bremen, Hamburg and Luebeck and in the states of Niedersachsen, Schleswig-Holstein and particular in the eastern federal-state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. All three German minority languages are endangered languages. Efforts are underway to preserve the languages and their culture but it is seemingly a losing battle.\n\nFinding people who speak and understand English is not a problem in most regions of Central Europe, especially in Switzerland, Austria and Germany. In Poland, Slovenia, Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic, English is widely spoken in the larger cities and by younger people; German and Russian are also spoken and understood by many older people in these countries. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russian"]]},", since the end of the Cold War and the unification of Europe is in steady decline.
