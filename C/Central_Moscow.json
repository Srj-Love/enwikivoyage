The roof, the diameter of which is 14m, looks light, but it is a firm construction made of more than 50,000 metal pods 743t, capable of supporting snowfall accumulation. Illumination is provided by huge arched skylights of iron and glass, each weighing some 740t and containing in excess of 20,000 panes of glass.
