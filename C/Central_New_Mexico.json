One minor warning: Albuquerque doesn't get much snow, and consequently, its residents aren't used to snowy roads.  When the occasional snowstorm does blow through, driving conditions in town can range from mildly crazy to downright alarming, more because of the behavior of the motorists than due to objective road hazard.\n\nPublic transportation in this area is generally limited to Albuquerque.
