So, too, is the central region. As a practical consequence, if you come from a Slavic country and would want to try a \"bilingual\" conversation, you will have to ask people to use proper Slovenian since local dialects, especially the rather detested variation used in Ljubljana, may be impossible to understand.\n\nAs elsewhere in Slovenia, you can rely on people speaking decent English and having at least basic knowledge of German, especially in the north. A desperate Italian, French or Spanish speaking tourist is quite likely to have some luck if he turns to the more polyglot younger generation.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nLjubljana is the central hub of Slovenia and the most common starting point of your visit to the country.
