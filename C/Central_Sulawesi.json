It should be noted that the road is in a bad condition, with potholes being quite common . Therefore heavy delays can be expected. It can be recommended to try to get a seat on the more comfortable executive bus for this reason. \n\nFrom the north: An overland busroute goes to Manado by Toli-Toli and Gorontalo, this is not very used by tourists though, as the Togian Islands is omitted on this route.\n\nBy boat\nSmall ferries arrives in Ampana from Wakai, the \"capital\" of the Togian Islands everyday apart from Sunday and Thursday.
