It is roughly a 45 minutes ride from the centre of Bangkok, but heavy congestion could make that trip into 1,5 hours or more. More information about the airport can be found in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bangkok"]]}," article.\n\nThe easiest way to get into Bangkok is by Airport Express Bus: the ticketing booth at the first floor sells flat 150-baht fixed-fare tickets to Bangkok's four main districts. You can also wait in line at the queue for a metered taxi at the first floor, a trip to the city costs about 250-400 baht. Always use the official taxi stand though, and make sure the meter is turned on, else you might get in trouble later on. In the future, a train line will open from Suvarnabhumi Airport that directly connects the airport with Makkasan station in downtown.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nThe Central Plains has good road connections with the east, south, north and northeast of the country.\n\nTwo main roads connect the Central Plains with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Eastern Thailand"]]},". The main road is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Sukhumvit Road"]},", also known as Route 3, which starts in Bangkok and via ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pattaya"]]}," reaches all the way to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Trat"]]}," and the Cambodian border.

Most visitors arrive in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bangkok"]]},", a true treasure house that literally has hundreds of sights. Prime sights are the Grand Palace, Wat Pho, Wat Arun and Jim Thompson's House, but it is just a small fragment of its historical and cultural heritage. The ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bangkok Metropolitan Area"]]}," is less inviting for foreigners, but there are some sights you can see. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Samut Prakan"]]}," has some interesting museums, or you could take a boat ride north to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nonthaburi"]]},", or even better, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ko Kret"]]},".\n\nThere are many day-trips you can undertake from Bangkok. The Summer Palace at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bang Pa-In"]]}," makes for a nice stop on the way to Ayutthaya. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ayutthaya"]]}," has been the capital of Siam for 400 years and its historical remains should not be missed. There are literally hundreds of structures spread over and around the island, so renting a bicycle or moped is recommended. A short train ride north brings you to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lop Buri"]]},", a smaller historical town known for its macaques. Many visitors take in Lop Buri before getting onto the sleeper train to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Northern Thailand"]]},".\n\nThere are endless fields of shrimp farms and rice paddies ",{"type":"[[","value":[["West of Bangkok"]]},", and of course the floating markets. The most popular among foreign visitors is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Damnoen Saduak"]]},", but the locals prefer to visit ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amphawa"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Samut Songkhram"],["Tha Kha"]]},". ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Samut Songkhram"]]}," makes a good base for getting to the floating markets. A scenic way to get here is with the Mae Khlong Railway, a slow and rustic train that requires a boat transfer at the fishing village of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Samut Sakhon"]]},". ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nakhon Pathom"]]}," makes a nice half-day visit for the Phra Pathom Chedi, the world's tallest stupa.\n\nGoing west, the terrain becomes more hilly as you get into the River Kwai Valleys. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kanchanaburi"]]}," is another popular stop on the tourist trail for the Bridge over the River Kwai and its World War II Museums. If you have a few days to spend in this area, some of the interesting attractions include the Erawan Falls and Hellfire Pass. A popular activity is to take a train ride over the bridge, just for the heck of it. You could even go all the way to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sangkhlaburi"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Three Pagodas Pass"]]},", a bus ride of four hours to the border with Myanmar.\n\nIf you're heading for the south, the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Northern Gulf Coast"]]}," has a lot to offer visitors.

",{"type":"[[","value":[["Phetchaburi"]]}," has a charming old quarter, and is often visited as a day-trip from Bangkok, Hua Hin or Cha-am. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hua Hin"]]}," is also home to the waterfalls of the Kaeng Krachan National Park and the natural scenery of the Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park.
