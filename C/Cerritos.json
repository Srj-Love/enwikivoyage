The titanium skin of the Cerritos Library in Los Angeles County, California, changes color in the light, but it's inside that things get really revolutionary. Meaning: no more shushing or musty bookshelves. Instead, visitors get quick answers from staff at information stands modeled after hotel concierge desks. Roving librarians use wireless headsets and handheld computers. The children's area features a full-size T. rex replica and a NASA space shuttle model. A 15,000-gallon aquarium makes the place a bit like Disneyland (just a few exits southeast).
