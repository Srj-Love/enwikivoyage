It was founded 15th century by Ivan Crnojevic. His son founded the first printing house in the South Slavs - about the time the Columbus discovered America! Due to the strategic nature of Montenegro, it being an independent state on the border of the Ottoman Empire, all of the major European powers had an embassy in Cetinje.  For this reason the town has a continental style old town located a thousand miles away from any of the continental cities that the architecture is representative of.
