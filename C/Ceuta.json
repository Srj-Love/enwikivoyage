[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Ceuta banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ceuta.si Ceuta"]}]}," is one of two ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Spain"],["Spanish"]]}," exclaves in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Africa"]]}," (the other one being ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Melilla"]]},"). The territory had several rulers before the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Portugal"],["Portuguese"]]}," in 1415 took control of this city east of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tangier"]]},". Since 1580 it has been under Spanish administration but has the status of an autonomous city despite being located on the African continent almost directly south of the autonomous city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gibraltar"]]},". \n\nThis exclave was in the spotlight in 2005 together with Melilla because hundreds of people were trying to climb over the border fence. Ceuta being part of Spain and therefore a safe haven for Africans made it a prime target for migrants. Today the border is heavily protected by the Guardia Civil. The ",{"type":"[[","value":[["European Union"]]}," invested a lot of money to make illegal immigration more difficult. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Vista de Ceuta desde el mirador de Isabel II.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Panoramics of Ceuta"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By sea"]},"\nCeuta is easily accessible from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Algeciras"]]}," (Cádiz) by ferry. High speed ferry services run between Ceuta and mainland ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Spain"]]}," every half hour as of summer 2007. One company operating the route is ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.trasmediterranea.es\/en Trasmediterranea"]}," and in the winter season they have three daily departures as of December 2013. Cruise ships occasionally visit, and usually dock within a few blocks of the easily-walked town.\n\nCruise ships do visit, but only very occasionally.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By road"]},"\nBy land, Ceuta is only accessible from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Morocco"]]},". If arriving by bus, you may have to take the bus to a nearby town and then a ground taxi to the border. For example, coming from the south, the closest an intercity bus will take you is to Fnideq. From there, take a ground taxi to the border (4 dh). It is much easier to go to Ceuta from Tetouán than from Tangier, as most buses from Tangier go through Tetouan anyways before heading north to Fnideq.\n\nTo come via Tetouan get a grand taxi near the CTM station. 15 MAD, 40 Km, 40 minutes will get you right to the border.\n\nYou will need a passport to cross the border with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Morocco"]]}," in either direction and official ID to book passage between mainland ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Spain"]]}," and Ceuta. Rules for immigration are the same as for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Spain"]]},". Ferry ticket salesmen have been known to sell tickets without requiring the proper identification, but security at the port going from Ceuta back to Algeciras can be much more strict. Spanish citizens need only their national ID cards, or DNI, but foreigners will require their passports to return. Just because you are not leaving the country of Spain doesn't mean you shouldn't carry your passport.\n\nThe increased border security may result in minor waiting time. This could be longer if you travel in summer when the main holiday season in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Spain"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["France"]]}," starts and lots of families return to their homes in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Morocco"]]},". Note that there seem to be separate lines for Moroccans and foreigners at many border crossings, ports, and security checks. If you find yourself stuck in an extremely slow moving line and do not look Moroccan, try getting noticed by an officer. You may find yourself ushered past the line and processed very quickly.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\nThere is just an heliport where ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.helisureste.com\/ Heli sur Este"]}," operates two daily connections between Ceuta and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Malaga"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nCeuta is a tiny city.
