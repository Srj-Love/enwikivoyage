The area as a whole is marshy, which inhibited early development until the Milwaukee Road Railroad was built through the area in the early 20th century.  The first station was at the location of the current Metra Station in Fox Lake.  This spurred the first major growth in the area as tourists from Chicago began arriving.  Many resorts were built including the now closed Mineola.\n\nHowever, the remote location proved to be a boon not only to tourists but also crime.  The resorts eventually banded together to create the Village of Fox Lake to stop interference from Lake County.  During prohibition, the area was renown the Chicagoland region for having very lose liquor enforcement and was an attraction for drinking, gambling and organized crime.  Al Capone was known to frequent the area and had a summer home in Antioch.\n\nThe Great Depression effectively ended much of the tourism industry in the area.  Gradually, many communities in the area transitioned into modern suburbs with a mixture of year-round residents and tourists.  Tourism only truly remains important in Fox Lake and Antioch, while the rest of the area has some but much less tourist attractions.  During the summer, the population of Fox Lake alone can swell to 100,000 people.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nCar is the primary method of entry into the Chain O' Lakes.
