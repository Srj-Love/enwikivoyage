Originally this ancient town was on the right bank of the Chao Phraya River at the mouth of Khlong Phraek Si Racha south of the old waterway. Established after the town of Phanthumwadi (Suphanburi Province), Chainat was Sukhothai's most important southern outpost built during the reign of King Phaya Loethai of Sukhothai during 1317–1336. This ancient community was called Mueang Phraek or Mueang San. When the Sukhothai Kingdom declined, Phraek became Ayutthaya's northern outpost. Later, a new community was established not far from Phraek. Its ruler was Chao Sam Phraya, who later ruled Ayutthaya and became King Borom Rachathirat II. This new community was a large town called Chainat.  In the reign of King Rama V, the main settlement of the province in Laem Yang was moved to the left bank of the Chao Phraya River. Mueang San slowly declined because most of the people migrated to Chainat. The old town later became a district of Chainat. Chainat was an important military base to confront with the Burmese armies. As all these confrontations were successful, the city gained the name Chainat.\n\t\nApart from its long history, Chainat is at presently famous for handicrafts, basketry, sculpture, weaving, as well as, the Benjarong pentachrome ceramics made with the finest and most sophisticated craftsmanship.
