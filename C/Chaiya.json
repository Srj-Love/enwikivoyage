Archaeologists believe that Indian traders from Madras visited the town as far back as the fifth century. Parts of the town's interesting history remain vague, but historians believe it to have been the capital of the empire. A number of archaeological sites in Chaiya have uncovered artifacts supporting this belief. \n\nThe town's role in maritime trade has long ago ceased and though archaeologists continue to unearth more and more artifacts testifying to its earlier culture, the town has mostly been forgotten. The Wat Phra Mahathat temple, found in Chaiya, is said to be the last well-preserved example of the Srivijaya Empire. It is one of the most venerated temples in Thailand. Other temples depicting the Srivijaya Empire architecture are the Wat Kaeo and Wat Suan Mok temples, also found in Chaiya.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["By train"]},"\nChaiya is accessible by rail via the Bangkok-South Thailand line.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["By car"]},"\nDrive from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chumphon"]]}," on Hwy 41.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nThe nearest airport is an hour away, in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Surat Thani"]]},". \n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get around "]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" See "]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Do "]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Buy "]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Eat "]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Drink "]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Sleep "]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Go next "]},"\n\nThe quiet fishing village of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ban Pu Ma Riang"]]}," lies east of Chaiya and is popular for its hand-woven silk.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Central Gulf Coast"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Chaiya District"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["9.3866666666667"],["99.2"]]}]
