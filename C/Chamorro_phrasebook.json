[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Welcome banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Chamorro"]},", or Chamoru, is the native language of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. Although the English language and Japanese language are commonplace on both Guam and the Northern Marianas Islands, people still use the Chamorro language. Chamorro is also used on the continental United States by immigrants and some of their descendants.\n\nThe numbers of Chamorro speakers have declined in recent years, and the younger generations are less likely to know the language. The influence of English, Spanish, and Japanese have caused the language to become endangered. Various representatives from Guam have unsuccessfully lobbied the United States to take action to promote the language.\n\nA large number of Chamorro words have Spanish etymological roots (e.g. tenda \"shop\/store\" from Spanish tienda), which may lead some to mistakenly conclude that the language is a Spanish Creole: However, Chamorro very much uses its loan words in a Micronesian way (e.g.: bumobola \"playing ball\" from bola \"ball, play ball\" with infix -um- and reduplication of root). However, Chamorro can also be considered a mixed language (Hispano-Austronesian) or a language that resulted of a contact and creolization process in the Mariana Islands. Modern Chamorro grammar has many elements of Spanish origin: articles, numbers, prepositions...\n\nThere are approximately 50,000 to 75,000 speakers of Chamorro throughout the Marianas archipelago. It is still common among Chamorro households in the Northern Marianas, but fluency has greatly decreased among Guamanian Chamorros during the years of American rule in favor of (a largely pidginized) American English. Ancient Chamorro is still spoken in the northern islands like Pagan, Saipan, Luta, and Tinian.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Pronunciation guide"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Vowels"]},"\nChamorro has six distinct vowels.\nThey are: å, a, i, e, u, and o. Note that å isn't usually distinguished in written Chamorro. Therefore you can't tell the difference between båba 'bad' and baba' 'open'.\n\n; Å : like English a in car (IPA \/a\/)\n; A : like English a in cat (IPA \/æ\/)\n; I : like English ee in meet or i in pit.\n; E : like English e in met or ee in meet or even i in pit.\n; U : like English oo in tool or u in put.\n; O : like English o in low or u in put.\n\nAll vowels are cardinal, like in Spanish, not like in English. The vowels I and E are similar because I sounds like 'ee' in meet when stressed, or 'i' in pit when unstressed. E sounds like 'e' in met when stressed, 'ee' in meet when unstressed or even 'i' in pit when unstressed.\nU and O are similar because U sounds like 'oo' in tool when stressed, or 'u' in put when unstressed. O can sound like 'o' in low when stressed, or 'u' in put when unstressed.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Consonants"]},"\nChamorro has \nB- as in boy\nCh- as in ca",{"type":"'''","value":["Bold text"]},"ts\nD- as in de\nF- as in Feh\nG- as in Geh\nH- as in Heh (short e sound)\nK- as in Keh\nL- as in Leh\nM- as in Meh\nN- as in Neh\nN- like the 'n' in senora\nNg\nO- as in \"oh\"\nP- as in \"peh\"\nR- as in reh\nS- as in seh\nT- as in teh\nU- as in oo in soon\nY- as in tzeh\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Common diphthongs"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Phrase list"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Basics"]},"\n; Hello!. :  Håfa adai!
