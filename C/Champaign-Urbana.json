The area dates to about the mid-nineteenth century, as Urbana was founded in 1833, Champaign in 1855 and the University in 1867.

Today, the cities can be described as growing, cosmopolitan and ethnically diverse, with a modern urban feel in the area's core.\n\nToday Champaign-Urbana is defined by some amount of traditional industry such as Kraft Foods, Hobbico, and others, a growing technology and information sector, and the University. The University is the county's largest employer and a very large institution of 43,000 students. It would be short-changing Champaign-Urbana to call it merely a college town. But there is no doubt that the center of gravity of the arts, entertainment, and intellectual communities rest with the University.\n\nIt would be safe to say that Champaign-Urbana is a very open-minded community with regard to social issues, and retains some Midwestern values such as virtue of hard work. Urbana is seen as the more politically liberal and pastoral of the two, and Champaign is seen as having more of a big-city feel. Champaign-Urbana residents are proud of their oasis of culture and big-city amenities amongst the cornfields, of the less intense traffic, sprawl and lower cost of living here compared to major cities, the University of Illinois Fighting Illini sports teams, and its burgeoning arts scene.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Willard Airport"]}," (airport code:CMI) ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.flycmi.com"]},", is a regional airport operated by the University of Illinois and located roughly 20 minutes south of downtown Champaign.

The \"Air Bus\" service maintains a very precise schedule, usually arriving at the airport at the bottom of the hour without delay.\n\nA typical taxi fare between the airport and Urbana west of Vine Street is $14 for the first person and $10 for each additional person (not including tip).\n  \nCar parking at Willard Airport (short- or long-term) costs a maximum of $5 a day. In contrast, all parking at nearby (45 mins away) ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cira.com\/ Central Illinois Regional Airport"]}," (airport code:BMI) in Bloomington, Illinois is free.
