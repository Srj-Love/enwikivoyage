The Tianchi Lake (Heaven Lake), vertical scenery, aerial park, Hot Springs, and waterfalls are among the six local natural wonders. The mountains, covered with primitive forests, make an excellent tourist destination.\n\nTianChi is 8 miles in circumference but cannot be circumnavigated since it overlaps with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Korea"]]}," (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mount Paektu"]]},").\n\nChangbaishan has two separate areas- the ",{"type":"''","value":["northern slope"]}," and the ",{"type":"''","value":["western slope"]},".

From ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Baihe"]]},", buses travel frequently to Chang Bai Shan to the vehicle switching station,  17 miles past the main gate. From the vehicle switching station, sport utility vehicles take you the rest of the way to the hot springs at the base of the mountain.\n\nBuses stop at the main entrance. Then you pay another fee for the \"eco-bus\" operated by the park concession. To get to the summit, you must take an SUV to the upper camp building, and then hike about 500 feet to the top. In June 2011, the snow was solid from camp to summit.  The summit is quite cold and windy.   Surplus Red Army jackets are available to borrow, apparently for free. In summer, the view down onto the lake is often blocked by clouds.\n\nAn alternate access is via Songjiang He, a village 40 km west of the Nature Reserve. The western approach offers more beauty with forests of trees gradually changing to meadows and flowers (in spring and early summer).\n\nThe easiest way to get to Changbaishan is by booking one of the three-day tours arranged through CITS in Jilin (at the Dongguan Hotel) costing ¥620 (¥420 for Chinese), which include all fees and accommodations, and which stop at all the major sightseeing stops, including Tian Chi.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" For navigation enter ",{"type":"'''","value":["Erdao Baihezhen"]}," for destination."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Changchun-> direction Airport\/Jilin G12->Jilin (1,5 hours)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Jilin->G12->Dunhua (1,5 hours)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Dunhua->G201-> (pass by Xiaoshahexiang,Yougqingxian) Erdao Baihezhen\/Bai he (3 hours)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" In July 2011 all the roads where new and good to drive.
