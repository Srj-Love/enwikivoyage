Owned by the US Navy, and is used for an instrumentation range. San Nicolas is the furthest of the Channel Islands from the mainland, located 7-8 hours by boat from Long Beach.  The island itself is not accessible to civilians, because it houses numerous classified facilities. However, the waters off San Nicolas are used for scuba diving. Large spiny lobsters are the target of the eager divers. However, the diving environs are quite rough and available to experienced\/certified divers only. Because of its hostile but productive dive environment, it has become legendary among California divers.
