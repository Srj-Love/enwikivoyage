There's a National Park, which has an area with 65,515 hectares with plenty of great landscapes, gorgeous waterfalls and lakes and is sought after by many travelers in search of true contact with nature.\n\nThere are basically two places where you can stay when travelling to Chapada dos Veadeiros: ",{"type":"''","value":["Alto Paraíso"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["São Jorge"]},".\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Chapada dos Veadeiros.png"],["thumb"],["325px"],["right"],["Map"]]},"\n",{"type":"''","value":["São Jorge"]}," is a small village right in front of the National Park's entrance. It lacks infrastructure like asphalt roads and public illumination, the intent is to leave the region around the park pretty much as it is, in order not to disturb it's fauna and flora. Even though it might sound uncomfortable for some, that's what makes the small village special. There you really feel you're somewhere mankind hasn't dominated yet, and there you can really experience Chapada.\n\nAlto Paraíso is a small city which is about 20 km (12.4 miles) from the National Park's entrance. Differently from São Jorge, it is a city with normal public illumination, asphalt roads and so on. You will find there more options for sleeping and eating.\n\nBeyond the National Park, the region has other attractions inside private properties such as the Moon Valley and the Almécegas waterfalls which are situated nearby São Jorge, being accessible through the payment of a daily fee.\n\nThe ",{"type":"''","value":["Chapada"]}," region is also a magnet for mystics attracted by the alleged properties of the its crystal soil and rumored UFO appearances.\n\nRumour has it that, according to NASA, the ",{"type":"''","value":["Chapada"]}," is Earth's brightest point as seen from space.

At the height of the dry season (September), the temperature can peak at 40°C (104°F).\n\nIn the beginning of the year the climate is very humid, and it rains pretty much everyday. It is ",{"type":"''","value":["very"]}," dangerous to be close to a waterfall during bad weather, so, avoid visiting the area during those days.\n\nAfter May, the rain ceases and the climate turns almost desertic. There's a six month period with almost no rain at all and it gets pretty dry and hot, as you can imagine (what makes the waterfalls even better!). In that sense, the best period for visiting is between June and July, because the probability of raining is very low, and the waterfalls still have plenty of water. After that, it is still worth seeing it, but the waterfalls won't be as good because they start running low on water (no, they never get dry).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Vale do maytrea.jpg"],["thumb"],["Maytrea Valley"]]},"\nThe city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alto Paraiso de Goias"]]},", the main gateway to the Chapada, is 230 km (143 miles) from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brasilia"]]}," and it is also fairly close to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Goiania"]]}," (capital of the Goiás state).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\nThere are no regular flights to the Chapada region.
