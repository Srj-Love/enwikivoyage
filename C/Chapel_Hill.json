The town is the smallest of the Triangle's three cities, with an influence and pull that belies its size. Based around the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the town caters heavily to the local student population, with plenty of bars and restaurants near the university's beautiful campus. Immediately to the west of Chapel Hill is the adjacent town of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Carrboro"]},", an old mill town now known for its local shops, restaurants and nightlife.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThe town was originally a small village of a thousand people consisting of mostly Scottish and English immigrants arriving in the area during the 1700s; the village took its name from the New Hope Chapel, which happened to be situated on a hill (the Carolina Inn of Chapel Hill now stands where the chapel once was). The town was founded in 1819 to support the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill and later was incorporated in 1851. The adjacent town of Carrboro was settled in the 1880s around a spur rail line built to serve the university. The town is named for Julian Carr, who purchased a local cotton mill and installed electricity in the town. Today, the town is home to the Weaver Street Market (a local co-op), a popular farmer's market, and a bunch of festivals.\n\nLike much of the rest of the Piedmont, the landscape is hilly and heavily wooded, becoming very lush and green in the summer months. While much of North Carolina is conservative, Chapel Hill is fairly liberal in comparison. Although legend says that the town became liberal when a Union general married former UNC President Swain’s daughter, Chapel Hill’s liberal politics are similar to many US college towns and are bolstered by nearby Carrboro, which is known for being a bastion of liberalism in the state. It is not uncommon to see a protest in Chapel Hill and\/or on the university campus for various liberal causes, with the traditional locus of this being the square in front of the post office on Franklin Street across from the campus.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Visitor information"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Chapel Hill\/Orange County Visitors Center"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.visitchapelhill.org\/"],["email="],["address=501 West Franklin St"],["lat=35.91003"],["long=-79.06334"],["directions="],["phone=+1 919 968-2060"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=M-F 8:30AM-5PM, Sa 10AM-2PM"],["price="],["content=Has information and brochures on the area."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["mapframe"],["35.9130"],["-79.0553"],["zoom=14"],["height=350"],["width=500"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Interstate 40"]}," passes along the north and east side of Chapel Hill, with three exits: ",{"type":"'''","value":["NC 86"]}," (Exit 266), ",{"type":"'''","value":["US 15\/501"]}," (Exit 270), and ",{"type":"'''","value":["NC 54"]}," (Exit 273).

When you're in town for the big game, and not on a tight budget, this is the place to stay. It's within easy walking distance to Franklin Street and every Friday evening hosts a pleasant celebration on the front lawn with bluegrass music and drink specials which is open to the whole town. Oh, and if you plan on staying here when your son or daughter graduates from UNC, go ahead and make your reservation when they are accepted to the university."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=The Franklin Hotel"],["url=http:\/\/www.franklinhotelnc.com\/"],["email="],["address=311 West Franklin St"],["lat=35.91114"],["long=-79.06010"],["directions="],["phone=+1 919 442-9000"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=$180-250"],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=Guestrooms are decorated with black and white pictures of historic Franklin Street.
