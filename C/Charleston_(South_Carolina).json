Its historic downtown is on a peninsula formed by two rivers, the Ashley and the Cooper, flowing into the Atlantic, and protected from the open ocean by surrounding islands.  Charleston was captured in the Civil War without much property damage, so the historic part of town has buildings that are hundreds of years old. The current downtown skyline, with practically no tall buildings due to the city's height restriction ordinance, is dominated by church steeples and the stunning Arthur Ravenel cable-stay bridge over the Cooper River. The city is a major port on the eastern seaboard of the US and a popular destination for domestic and international tourists.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Imperial"],["janhigh = 59"],["febhigh = 62"],["marhigh = 68"],["aprhigh = 76"],["mayhigh = 83"],["junhigh = 88"],["julhigh = 90"],["aughigh = 89"],["sephigh = 85"],["octhigh = 77"],["novhigh = 69"],["dechigh = 61"],["janlow = 38"],["feblow = 40"],["marlow = 46"],["aprlow = 53"],["maylow = 62"],["junlow = 69"],["jullow = 72"],["auglow = 72"],["seplow = 67"],["octlow = 56"],["novlow = 46"],["declow = 39"],["janprecip = 3.5"],["febprecip = 3.1"],["marprecip = 4.4"],["aprprecip = 2.8"],["mayprecip = 4.1"],["junprecip = 6"],["julprecip = 7.2"],["augprecip = 6.9"],["sepprecip = 5.6"],["octprecip = 3.1"],["novprecip = 2.5"],["decprecip = 3.1"],["description = ",{"type":"{{","value":[["ForecastNOAA"],["Charleston"],["32.78121"],["-79.93154"]]}]]},"\n\nCharles Towne, as it was first called, was established in 1670 by Anthony Ashley Cooper on the west bank of the Ashley River, Charles Towne Landing, a few miles northwest of the present downtown. By 1680, the settlement had grown and moved to its present peninsular location.\n\nAround 1690, the English colonists erected a fortification wall around the small settlement to aid in its defense. The wall sheltered the area, in the present French Quarter, from Cumberland St. south to Water St., from Meeting St. east to East Bay St.  The wall was destroyed around 1720.  Cobblestone lanes and one building remain from this colonial English Walled Town: the Powder Magazine, where the town's supply of gunpowder was stored.  Remnants of the colonial wall were found beneath the Old Exchange Building.\n\nLuckily, Charleston was re-captured in the Civil War without much property damaged, and it was the first city in the U.S. to pass a historical preservation ordinance.  Thus, much of the beautiful architecture, from early Colonial, Georgian, Federal, Greek Revival, and Italianate to Victorian, remains for future generations to see and enjoy.\n\nCharleston is also known as The Holy City due to the numerous church steeples, which dot the city's low-rise skyline, and the fact that it was one of the few places in the original thirteen colonies to provide religious tolerance to the French Huguenots as well as to Jews.\n\nCharleston is in general a laid-back, but sophisticated, city and has an old-South feel, just like its neighbor, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Savannah"]]},". Most people in Charleston are helpful when approached in a polite manner. If a traveler speaks little English, Charlestonians are still generally willing to help as best they can.  It is advisable, however, to at least learn a few key English phrases, and perhaps carry a traveler's phrasebook.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nThe dialect here varies from standard American English, having a  \"Southern Coastal Accent\" that contains British influences. For those who learned Standard English, some speech may be difficult to comprehend here. Generally speaking, one can easily get by with Standard American or British English, though. The inhabitants of Charleston are, to a large degree, transient (due to several military installations, port labor, rail labor, and other factors), and therefore many other languages are inherent in a minority role.\n\nA minority dialect spoken here is Gullah, a dialect of English almost incomprehensible to most English Speakers. If you are familiar with \"Porgy and Bess\", you are familiar with Gullah. Gullah has West-African influences mixed with pidjin French and English. The dialect originated around John's Island. If you travel south of the city (to the islands, or towards Ravenel), the dialect becomes somewhat more prevalent (although still in a minority context).\n\nAlternate languages include Spanish and Portuguese, brought to the city and its outskirts by its large Latin American population. One may encounter \"Spanglish\" here, which is an odd combination of Spanish and English.\n\nPlace names in and around Charleston are often very Americanized versions of French (Lagare Street, for example, is pronounced luh-GREE) or other languages.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Arthur Ravenel Jr Bridge1.jpg"],["400px"],["thumb"],["The Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge carries U.S. 17 over the Cooper River"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nCharleston is served by ",{"type":"{{","value":[["marker"],["type=listing"],["name=Charleston International Airport"],["url=http:\/\/www.chs-airport.com\/"],["lat=32.8846"],["long=-80.0369"]]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["CHS"]]},"), located about 12 miles northwest of historic downtown.  The small 2-concourse terminal is functional, with dark decor absent of any antebellum charm (unlike the lovely Savannah Airport terminal).

If a taxi to the airport is required, it must generally be arranged in advance. Expect at least a half-hour wait for a taxi to arrive; if staying in a hotel, hotel staff can help arrange for a taxi.  Another option is to take a shuttle van from the airport - this may be cheaper. However, upon noting that one is leaving the city for the airport, transport will generally arrive with undue haste.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By tour bus or carriage"]},"\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/graylineofcharleston.com\/ Gray Line of Charleston"]}," offers a choice of guided mini-bus tours of the historic, charming city of Charleston, designed to give you a fun and informative look into the city’s well-preserved past.\n\nA great way to tour the city is by carriage drawn by horses or mules (many vendors available at the Market in downtown Charleston), although one might prepare oneself for some derisive comment and exasperation from locals inconvenienced by such quaint methods of transit.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By foot"]},"\nLuckily for visitors to Charleston's peninsula, the historic district is accessible on foot. If staying in one of the many hotels on the peninsula, a visitor could easily explore most of the city's major historical sites without the benefit of a car, either by foot or with the help of the DASH trolley lines.  Unfortunately, the plantations—a significant part of Charleston's history—are not located within walking distance of the peninsula.  If you are driving into the historic downtown, the first thing to do is to find someplace to park.  Garage parking is available at the Visitor Center for $2\/hr, but metered street parking is also available throughout the city.\n\nThe streets in historic downtown Charleston are more or less parallel and perpendicular to the Cooper River waterfront, forming a warp grid pattern, with a major shift in the angle of the grid at the east-west \"fault line\" of Beaufain\/Hasell Street, just north of the old ",{"type":"''","value":["Market Area"]}," near the waterfront.  The major east-west street, Calhoun Street, was once known as the Boundary Street, separating the then-suburbs north of it from the urban area south of it.  The major north-south street, King Street, is the main shopping street in downtown, from the ",{"type":"''","value":["Upper King"]}," area north of Calhoun around the Visitor Center south to the upscale  anchor, Charleston Place, at Beaufain\/Hasell.\n\nSeveral blocks south is a major east-west street, Broad Street, which divides two areas in historic downtown, aptly named ",{"type":"''","value":["North of Broad"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["South of Broad"]},".  Those South of Broad were nicknamed SOBs, and those Slightly North of Broad were SNOBs. The",{"type":"''","value":[" French Quarter"]},", founded by the French Huguenots, is just south of the Market Area along the waterfront.  The area near the southern tip of the peninsula, where the Ashley and Cooper Rivers meet, is known as ",{"type":"''","value":["The Battery"]},".\n \nThere are many walking tours, which give you the opportunity to see more than just driving past in a bus or carriage.  There is a walking tour for virtually every interest.  You will find Pub Tours, Civil War tours, culinary tours, ghost tours, Gulla tours, architecture tours, art tours, and even pirate tours.  Some of the walking tour companies offer tours with guides in period costume. Charleston Pirate Tours even has a costumed guide whose parrot, a blue and gold macaw, accompanies the tour.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nA good place to start a tour of Charleston is the ",{"type":"{{","value":[["marker"],["type=see"],["name=Visitor Center"],["lat=32.7894"],["long=-79.9369"]]}," at 375 Meeting St. (between John and Ann Sts.)

At the Visitor Center, a traveler can find maps and guides, tour a small museum dedicated to the history of Charleston, book sightseeing tours, and view an introductory film to Charleston ($2).
