Of the eight U.S. presidents who came from Virginia, two — Thomas Jefferson and James Monroe — were from Charlottesville, and two more came from neighboring counties.  Central Virginia was a major battlefield during the Civil and Revolutionary Wars. Jefferson, whom locals affectionately call \"Mr. Jefferson,\" or \"TJ,\" continues to cast a long shadow, particularly over local architecture.  Many of Charlottesville's public buildings are made of brick and built in a Jeffersonian style, and many private homes are colonial. His home at Monticello and the Jefferson-designed University of Virginia have set the tone for the communities beautiful buildings. When visiting Charlottesville, be sure to stop by the Albemarle Charlottesville Historical Society to learn more about the area's rich history. \n\nThe culture of Charlottesville revolves around two points: the University of Virginia and the Historic Downtown Mall.  Charlottesville is a major cultural center for central Virginia, and features more fine dining, shopping, and entertainment than one might expect for a town of its size. Ensconced in beautiful Albemarle County, Charlottesville is also surrounded by vineyards and horse country - the best of all worlds. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Charlottesville Albemarle Airport"]},", (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["CHO"]]},").

Two or three northbound and two or three southbound trains stop in Charlottesville each day (the number depends on the day). The station is on West Main Street, about halfway between the Downtown Mall and the University (3\/4 mile to each), but within walking distance of several restaurants. Plan to call for taxi service or take the CTS bus or trolley if you are not walking.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nThe major highways leading into Charlottesville are US-29 and I-64. I-64 is a four-lane interstate leading to Charlottesville from east and west. There is rarely traffic on I-64 near Charlottesville, and the only major hill is crossing Afton Mountain, about 30 minutes west of town. US-29 is an extremely variable road. To the south, it is a four-lane road with frequent curves and at-grade crossings, but few traffic lights. To the north, the road alternates between being a four-lane commercial center with frequent traffic lights and buisnesses and being more similar to US-29 south of town.
