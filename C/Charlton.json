The town of Charlton is 50 miles or less from five major New England cities; Boston, Worcester, Springfield, Hartford and Providence.Charlton was first settled in 1735. It was established as a District separated off from Oxford on January 10, 1755, and became a Town in 1775 by a law that made all Districts into Towns.It was named after Sir Francis Charlton. During the 1800s, farming continued to be the major occupation, but woolen mills were being built along some of the town's brooks by the turn of the twentieth century.Charlton is surrounded by towns filled with history and things to do. One would not often choose Charlton as a place to visit but throughout the year there are great events that an out of towner might want to see or partake in including the Old home day and Memorial Day parades, Dudley's Strawberry Festival or Worcester's Restaurant week.
