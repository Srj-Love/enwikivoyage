This short, narrow winding road, full of Amish Buggies, animals and pedestrian's, is sometimes overwhelmed by \"English\" visitors on motorcyles in packs of ten or more, vans loaded with shopping mothers and children and car loads of sight seeing visitors. In truth, most of the Amish would just as soon you were not there, but in Berlin visiting the \"English\" merchants who parasitically, live off of the Amish legend. The Amish are very polite and will be very friendly, but you are cluttering their world. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Ohio_-_Amish_PB.pg.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["200px"],["Amish Phone Booth"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["SR 39 to Route 557"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Guggisberg Cheese"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.babyswiss.com\/"],["email="],["address=5060 SR 557"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content= Award winning cheese factory and showroom."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":["Beautiful farms, homes, children, people."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nBe careful when driving, the narrow roads are full of Amish buggies, horse drawn farm equipment, animals and children.
