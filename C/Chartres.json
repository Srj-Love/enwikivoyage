The RN10 is the \"old\" road from Paris to Chartres (and beyond) and there is no toll. Most of it is dual carriageway, although there are a few tricky 3 lane sections.

For people 25 and under there is \"La carte 12-25\" where one can save up to 75% on ticket prices.  There are also cards available for seniors and special vacation passes.
