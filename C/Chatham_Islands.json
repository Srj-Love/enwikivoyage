The islands are in their own time zone, 45 minutes ahead of New Zealand time; the International Date Line jogs eastward to keep them on the same calendar day as the rest of New Zealand.\n\nThe islands lie 860 km east of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Christchurch"]]},", in the middle of the \"Roaring Forties\". Steeped in culture and history, these islands are on the very edge of civilisation. Experience Moriori culture, experience Rekohu.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThe Chatham Islands consist of the main island, Chatham Island itself, with a population of 600, smaller Pitt Island with about 40 inhabitants, and a number of rocky outcrops. The islands are volcanic in origin and have a unique and sensitive habitat that supports many rare and endangered species.\n\nThe original people of the islands are the Moriori, who were descended from the Maori of mainland New Zealand, but who developed their own culture and variant of the language. In 1835 Maori settlers from the mainland arrived, massacred and enslaved the Moriori.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nThe only way for visitors to travel to the Chathams is via scheduled or chartered air service.

There are no same-day return flights, so once there you have to stay at least one night.\n\nAlthough flying to the Chathams and back is not cheap, it is worth it. Even the mainland school groups that fly there for ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.school-camps.co.nz school camps"]},", and choose to stay at Kopinga Marae ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.education-resources.co.nz"]}," get value for money by chartering a flight one way. Anyway, you don't have a choice on how you get there, unless you happen to own an aeroplane.\n\nHowever, when you get off that aeroplane, if you haven't pre-organised transport, you will have to walk, and it is a long way into town.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\nThe only scheduled shipping service to the Chatham Islands remains the Black Robin Freighters \"Rangatira\", an antiquated, slow and small coastal trading vessel. This boat has serviced the islands for many years, but does not carry passengers. Freight charges on the Rangatira appear to be flexible and subject to change.\n\nVessels can call at the Chathams and there are a number of \"safe\" harbours for shelter if the need arises. Remember to notify the local policeman, or Ministry of Fisheries officer if you are entering New Zealand via the Chathams. If you want a wharf berthage then call the local harbour master as you near the Chathams and he will sort you out.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThere are several businesses on Chatham Island that will rent you a vehicle. Do not expect the flashest and latest in rental cars though.

Maori have a marae and the local iwi, Ngati Mutunga o Wharekauri, have an office building here as well. Maori culture is very strong on the Chathams. The \"Chathams\" culture is a blend of all three ethnicities and has been shaped by the environment, the lifestyle, the contributions from each \"ethnicity\" and a community that has learned to rely on each other and deal with whatever is thrown their way, usually with a grin and a great deal of determination.
