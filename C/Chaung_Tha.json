[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Mena-asia_default_banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Chaung Tha"]}," is a coastal town and beach resort in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Irrawaddy"]]}," region of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Myanmar"]]},".\n\nThis beach resort is expanding fast and you can now find many beach side resort hotels. Step from your bungalow straight onto the beach. Although there are not so many foreign visitors, the number is growing and hotels are upgrading their facilities to accommodate them. \n\nThe beach itself is a long expanse of golden sand. Each hotel tries to clean its own beachside daily. Many vendors work the beach, but are not pushy. Some carry fresh live seafood and will barbecue it for you upon request. Inflatable rings and dinghies are available for hire.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nBuses leave Yangon around dawn and take 5-6 hours to reach Chaung Tha. The last 2 hours or so of the trip are on very bad roads, making the trip longer. The buses make 2-3 scheduled stops along the way at roadside cafes. The journey costs around 8,000 kyat. Return buses leave Chaungtha at 05:30 or so and drop off at the bus station outside of Yangon. There is also an Asia Dragon air conditioned bus that leaves Chaungtha at 09:30 and drops off in the centre of Yangon near the train station, for 8,000 kyat. \n\nTravellers departing from Yangon should set aside an extra hour for travel between the city centre and the outskirts bus station. Expect to pay 1,500 kyat from the centre to the bus station.\n\nYou can negotiate with any Yangon taxi driver to take you by taxi (some have air conditioning), so if you're travelling in a group of 3 or 4 and you split the cost it can be worthwhile. But remember the taxi will be returning empty, so you have to consider this when agreeing the price. If your trip is for just a few days, it may be better to negotiate with the driver to stay in town (he'll probably sleep in his taxi) and then he'll be able to bring you back also. Current rate is around USD150 one way, which can be negotiated down to close to USD120.\n\nAnother option is to take a bus to Pathein (3-4 hours, around 8,000 kyat). From there, you can take a local bus for another 2-3 hours. The last bus leaves at 16:00. After 16:00, it's possible to negotiate a transfer from Pathein to the beach via a pickup taxi for around 45,000-50,000 kyat (1.5 hours). If you are not traveling with a lot of luggage, it's also possible to do this trip via a motorbike for around 10,000 kyat per person (2 hours). Be mindful of the bad roads for this portion of the trip, i.e., this option is not for travelers looking for comfort.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe main strip is located directly by the beach, meaning all eating and relaxing needs can be satisfied on foot. Motorbike taxis are available for trips to beautiful Pokala Island, which also requires a short boat ride (1,000 kyat return).\n\nThe motorbike taxis wait outside most of the hotels and are plentiful. Expect to pay 500 kyat per trip, although nothing is very far. Sidecar (a bicycle with a sidecar of two back to back seats) are also available at a more leisurely pace for the same fare.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nNorthern beaches are considered cleaner. On the other hand depending on circumstances, beaches in the centre may be cleaner; after a storm, northern beaches may have black stuff washed up on them.\n\nWhite sand beach to the north, can walk on the beach to get there. Some say this is cleaner. Go past the small pagoda standing on a small hill in the water, there is another pagoda further up, with three large rocks in the water. Can get there by motorcycle, but the road is muddy with a lot of ruts. Likewise the beach route is hard to drive on, if you are not that experienced with motorbikes, and driving on sand, you may need a local driver if you want to go by bike. \n\nA motorbike ride to Ngwe Saung Beach is highly recommended (about 1.5-2 hr). It follows the beach and includes 3 river crossings by a small boat. This is a very scenic trip. Can be arranged with a travel agency or your hotel for 13,000-15,000 kyat. \n\nPokala Island is particularly beautiful, and just a short motorcycle-boat trip away from the main beach street.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nInteract with the locals; it inevitably leads to the best adventures.\n\nCharacters you may meet on your travels include Tun Wai, an educated motorcycle driver only too happy to take you on shoestring-priced tours of Chaungtha's environs, and a deaf gentlemen the locals refer to as \"The Good Man\", who likes to take foreigners on similarly inexpensive fishing trips.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=George Tourist Information"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Opposite AMBO Hotel"],["phone=09-49264479"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=George is the local tour service organiser of airport transfers and day trips.

Here you can buy souvenirs, local snack foods and beach clothing. Go into the village for the local's market of fish, vegetables and provisions.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nNumerous restaurants line the main beach road, serving seafood in addition to the typical Myanmar cuisine. Most serve mango or delicious traditional desserts as a complimentary after-dinner treat.\n\nTry to avoid eating at the larger hotel restaurants, as locals complain that they stifle competition by buying up all the freshly caught seafood and locally grown potatoes from the town's markets.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Pasta Fresca"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Italian-owned family restaurant.
