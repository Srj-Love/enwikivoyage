Also on the grounds are literally hundreds and hundreds of classes for the visual and performing arts, computer skills, writing, philosophy, sports and hobbies, and even professional development. Considering there are also plenty of recreational and cultural activities for your off-hours, it's no wonder people have been flocking here since 1874.
