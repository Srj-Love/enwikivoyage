It has a lovely white beach and vibrant nightlife, especially at its north end.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Understand "]},"\nChaweng is the largest and most popular of Samui's beaches, and is usually divided into three sections: North Chaweng, Central Chaweng and Chaweng Noi (Little Chaweng) around a headland to the south. Chaweng Beach is the longest beach on Samui's east coast. The beach is beautiful here and local developers are finally cleaning up some of the trashy areas nearby. It attracts many young travellers and families alike, but still remains good value for money. \n\nThe beach is approximately 7 km long with powdery white sand. It is bordered by emerald-blue waters and a coral reef where waves break, leaving the bay quite peaceful. Not far from the beach, there are two small islands near the reef. After swimming, you can explore the nearest one by walking through shallow water or go for snorkelling and kayaking at the second island which is further out and larger. \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Chaweng-beach koh Samui.jpg"],["thumb"],["Chaweng beach"]]},"\n\nThe central part of the beach is a bit more crowded than the quieter north. Many vendors pass by, offering beverages, fruit, ice cream and local Thai food for the more daring. A variety of local crafts and Thai souvenirs are also available. \n\nThe beach itself is usually accessed through the hotels, as there are no beach roads to disturb the peacefulness of the area. It is very relaxing but noticeably more touristy during the high season. The water is clean with normal temperatures between 25-28Â°C. \n\nParallel to the beach, clustered in the middle of the strip, lies Samui's greatest concentration of restaurants, bars, souvenir shops, and of course, fast food and convenience stores.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\nChaweng is a few minutes ride south of the airport. If you book a taxi at the airport's transport desk, it will cost 400 baht. A shared van (usually requiring 5 passengers before it departs) will cost 120 baht per person. Taxi drivers rarely use taxi meters here. If you decide not to use the booking desk, negotiate the fare in advance with the taxi driver. It should cost from 200-400 baht. Or you may book a transfer with your hotel. This service usually costs 300 baht, though some of the higher-end hotels have quoted rates of 400 baht per person. \n\nYou may opt to take other, more adventurous forms of transportation like the following:\n\nMotorcycle taxis are ordinary motorbikes and you sit behind the driver during the ride. Depending on the distance, the price ranges from 30-150 baht.\n\nMotorbike rentals are available if riding solo is what you prefer. Most motorbike rentals in Chaweng offer 100-125 cc bikes such as Honda Waves, Honda Clicks, Suzuki Steps, etc. Rentals cost 100-200 baht per day depending on the length of the rental.\n\nBigger motorbikes like Harley Davidson's and sport bikes like Kawasaki Ninjas and Honda CBRs are also available. Be warned that bike accidents tend to be a regular occurrence in Ko Samui, so drive carefully.\n\nIf you are travelling in a large group, you may opt to rent a Jeep. The rental usually costs at least 800 baht per day. A private car will set you back 1,500 baht or more per day. There are many models to choose from: Honda Jazz, Isuzu Hi-Lander, Toyota Camry, Toyota Fortuner, etc. Established rental companies such as Avis and Hertz also offer insurance. It might be a good idea to get the insurance along with the rental as having no insurance and an accident could be expensive.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Song Kran 2012 Chaweng.jpg"],["thumb"],["Song kran"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Do "]},"\nAlmost all activities are on the beach (even parts of the nightlife) and most Samui ",{"type":"'''","value":["dive shops"]}," are based in Chaweng.
