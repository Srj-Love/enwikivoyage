It is the largest known meteor to enter Earth's atmosphere since the 1908 \"Tunguska Event\". The high heat and extreme pressures of entering and traveling through the atmosphere caused the meteor to explode at an altitude of 30–50 km, sending a powerful shockwave through the city and surrounding regions.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["People"]},"\nPeople in Chelyabinsk are mostly Russians, Tatars and Bashkirs, other nations are present as well. People of Chelyabinsk are very different. The level of education can vary as well as social background and wealth. The society is extremely polar from incredibly rich to extremely poor. In the city there are a lot of factory workers and in general people of labor, especially far from the downtown.\n\nThe number of English-speakers is very low. Those who seem to speak it mostly know only a couple of phrases from their school study which is quite poor considering languages. More probable that you meet an English-speaking person among young people than among old ones. It is adviceable to get acquaintances in the city in advance. For that you can use local English-speaking on the VK ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/vk.com"]}," social network or local CouchSurfing ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/couchsurfing.org"]}," community.\n\nRussian people on the streets and in local transport seem to be a bit rude and not smiley which gives you a bad first impression. They are mostly poor and closed inside their numerous problems and apart it is not in Russian culture to show false emotions. You smile only when you feel really happy or something funny happened, otherwise Russians keep straight face, it is normal. In reality people are really helpful, hospitable and frank, it is only hidden by their everyday masks of unhappiness.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Literature"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Film"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nChelyabinsk is served by its own airport.

It is a typically Russian transport. Marshrutka can be considered as a shared taxi but it follows a certain route. All marshrutkas have route numbers painted on them. They follow the route like a city bus but they stop at bus stops only on demand. If you want to take marshrutka, stay at the right place (a bus stop) and hitch by stretching your hand. If you want to exit, just say it to the driver, preferably very loudly. Keep in mind that the driver will only stop at the next official bus stop and he might not hear you. You would better ask other passengers for instructions. This sounds as an incovenience but as soon as you get accustomed to marshrutkas, you appreciate them. The transport network covers all the city and surroundings, the speed of a marshrutka is comparably high (much higher than one of buses as it doesn't stop at every bus stop) and the number of vehicle is tremendously big. The waiting period is usually about 5–10 minutes in suburbs and 1–3 minutes in the city center as there are a lot of routes. It is highly adviceable to but a map of routes and to ask locals. As well there are very good free electronic maps in Russian (2Gis). You can use online maps as well (Google, Yandex...).\n\nThe typical price is 15 rubles but there are higher prices on longer routes (it can be 20 rubles between districts and more expensive from the airport). In Chelyabinsk you should pay to the driver as soon as you get on a marshrutka (in some other cities you should pay when you get off). It is common to ask other passengers to pass money to the driver. It is quite safe as people would almost never steal your money in that situation. Passing the change back is common as well. There are marshrutkas with two types of doors. One type is automatic, so passengers should not do anything with the door. Another type is a sliding door which should be opened or closed manually. You should always close the door when get on a marshrutka or get off it last.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bicycle"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Forest climbing"],["url=http:\/\/lesext.bget.ru\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=250r"],["content=Climb from one pine tree to another"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Swim"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Swim in one of many Ural lakes.
