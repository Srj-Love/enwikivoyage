Originally based around a monastery, the settlement was granted city status in 1170.  Due to its location at the foot of the Erzgebirge (literally ore mountains) in the sixteenth century Chemnitz began to grow in size an importance.  Initially as a place of trade and later as the base of industrial production. \n\nThe increase in Sachsen coal mining during the 18th century allowed Chemnitz to develop into one of the most important centres of the German machine and textile industries - factors which gave it the nickname of \"little ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Manchester"]]},"\". Several large areas of the city were built during this period including Kaßberg and Sonnenberg.  Due to the economic importance of Chemnitz it was a prime target for the Allied air force during World War II.  By 1945 the city had undergone near to total destruction.  Between 1953 and 1990 Chemnitz was renamed as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Karl-Marx-Stadt"]}," (even though Marx himself had never visited nor had anything to do with the city's contemporary history).  A great deal of new building occurred during this period, much of which remains today.  The large bronze head was presented to the town's people in 1971. \n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Saxony Chemnitz 2008.png"],["250px"],["thumbnail"],["right"],["Location of Chemnitz in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saxony"]]}]]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Chemnitz2 hb.JPG"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Chemnitz market square"]]},"\nUnlike Berlin and Leipzig, Chemnitz has experienced much less of demolition and rebuilding since the reunification.  Modern buildings like the new department store, communist era flats and more historic buildings are within walking distance of each other.  Parts of Chemnitz allow a glimpse into how a city of the DDR felt and looked, something that is increasingly hard to find in the neuen Bundesländer.\n\nEven with this the centre of Chemnitz has been described as \"Germany's most recent city centre\". The initial commercial investment after reunification focussed on large out-of-town shopping centres and it wasn't until 1999 that major building activity started in the city centre. Comparable only to Potsdamer Platz in Berlin, a whole new quarter of the city has been reconstructed in recent years. New buildings include the Kaufhof Department Store by Helmut Jahn, Galerie Roter Turm (façade by Hans Kollhoff) and Peek&Cloppenburg Clothing Store by Ingenhofen and Partner.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Altes und Neues Chemnitzer Rathaus.jpg"],["250px"],["thumbnail"],["right"],["The old and new Town Halls"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\nChemnitz, as part of the Sachsen-Franken-Magistrale (train route connecting Saxony and Franconia), can be easily accessed by train from several of the other cities in Saxony but also from Bavaria and Thuringia.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Leipzig"]}," (connections every hour, travelling time is about 50 minutes only)"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Dresden"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Zwickau"]}," (mostly 2 connections every hour)"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Nuremberg"]}," (once every hour)"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Erfurt"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["Weimar"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["Jena"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Gera"]}," (every two hours)"]},"\nThere is only one direct train from and to ",{"type":"'''","value":["Berlin"]}," each day (with the so-called \"Vogtlandbahn\").\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Opernhaus Chemnitz abends.jpg"],["250px"],["thumbnail"],["right"],["The Chemnitz Opera"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The local airfield in Chemnitz-Jahnsdorf 12 km away serves business and small private charter only.
