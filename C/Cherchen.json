It is the largest town east of Khotan in southern Xinjiang.\n\nThis area has a truly ancient human history, based on the 3,500-year-old cemetery along the ancient Jade Road that traded with the earliest Chinese dynasties and the similarly-dated Bronze Age rock carvings south of town along another ancient trade route to what is now Tibet and a forgotten back door to central China.\n\nMore than a thousand years later, the area was ruled as the kingdom of Calmadana during the earliest heyday of the Silk Road. Its fortunes have since ebbed and flowed, mainly with the popularity of the southern trade route: sometimes abandoned, as when Buddhist monk Xuan Zang passed through in the year 644, and other times bustling, as when Marco Polo came by in 1273.\n\nCherchen has a surprisingly large modern center, with wide paved streets, traffic lights, modern hotels, modern restaurants, a hospital, a large central square, a commercial airport, a supermarket, a computer store, Internet cafes, and several large apartment blocks. \n\nVisitors can also explore pleasant rural, Uyghur residential neighborhoods, including a large district just across the street from center of town. There are rural pasturelands, with flocks of sheep, and agricultural fields to wander about a bit farther from the center. The Uyghur bazaar is small but interesting, and the traveler can pick up a game of pool at one of a dozen tables at the bazaar entrance.\n\nCherchen does not see many foreign visitors, though it has a lot to offer. More than 60,000 Chinese travelers visited in 2005, but only 448 foreign visitors. \n\nThis scarcity of foreign tourists may be due to the minimal tourist information previously available in English. These sparse blurbs mostly describe out-of-date information about poor roads and minimal transportation. Even recently-updated China guidebooks still, unfortunately, reprint the same tired, archaic lamentations. \n\nCherchen County spent ¥8 million in 2005 alone on tourist infrastructure such as roads and ¥2.5 million in 2005 on tourism sights, and tourism spending continues apace so access and support will continue to improve.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nMany foreign travelers coming through Cherchen are headed for Dunhuang, Xining or Golmud (and onward to Lhasa) through Qinghai Province.  A 4WD vehicle is needed for just one leg of this trip, between Karghilik (350km east of Cherchen) and Shimiankuang, QH, (241km past that).  This means, if you are taking a private tour, you have 4WD vehicles the entire way from Kashgar or Khotan or wherever you begin, so travel agents tell you the whole thing is a 4WD track.  But you can go by bus, independently, on great roads, for every other leg, and take a 4WD ",{"type":"''","value":["public car"]},", which leaves every morning from the Karghilik bus station to Shimiankuang.  Northern Xinjiang was only opened to foreign visitors during the 1980s, but much of southern Xinjiang was still closed, except with special permission, into the 1990s. Prior to 1996, the roads to Cherchen were indeed in poor shape. Fewer buses took much longer to reach it, with frequent delays, the journey was less comfortable, and the accommodations, once one arrived, were limited.  Today, however, there are daily long-distance buses east and west, including a daily bus to and from Hotan. The roads,now well-paved asphalt highways, are in good shape, both west to Niya \/ Minfeng and Khotan and east to Karghilik and, from there, north to Korla. One can also fly here.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Khotan"]}," - 605km, daily bus takes 11 hours (also spelled Hotan or Hetian)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ruoqiang"]}," - 351km, daily bus takes 6 hours (also called Charklik)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Korla"]}," - 708km, four daily buses take about 10 hours (also spelled Kuerle)"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["The most famous sights"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Ancient Ruins"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=The most famous thing about the city is an archeological find, mummies from the ancient Tocharian civilisation.
