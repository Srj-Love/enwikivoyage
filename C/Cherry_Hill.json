The first settlement was a small cluster of homes named Colestown, on the perimeter of what is now the Colestown Cemetery on the corner of Route 41 which is also known as King's Highway and Church Road. The municipality was founded on February 25, 1844, in Gloucester County as Delaware Township from half of the area of Waterford Township, and became part of Camden County at its creation some two weeks later on March 13, 1844. The township underwent explosive growth in the post-World War II era, with continued population growth until the 1980s. Today, the municipality's population remains stable with new development generally occurring in small pockets of custom luxury homes or through the rehabilitation and adaptive reuse of existing commercial and industrial areas.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The PATCO high-speed commuter rail line has a stop at Woodcrest Station in Cherry Hill.
