Approximately 700 km from Bangkok, Chiang Mai and its province is known for its relatively high mountain ranges (Doi Suthep, Doi Inthanon, Doi Luang Chiang Dao, etc.), abundant flora and fauna, and cooler weather at higher elevation. The province is one of the country's largest in area, covering 20,107 square kilometers.\n\nThe meaning of \"Chiang Mai\" is \"new city\". It was founded as the capital of the Lanna Kingdom in 1296 by King Meng Rai. Chiang Mai not only served as capital of the kingdom, but also as its religious centre, thus innumerable temples were built there.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Culture "]},"\nNorth Thailand's predominant culture is Lanna in origin and its people are proud of their northern roots. The region is home to distinctly different food, music, arts, way of life, and even language. Chiang Mai is also overlain by mosaic of hill tribes, each with its own unique culture.\n\nMaintaining their traditional lifestyles, the major hill tribes are: Akha; Karen; Hmong; Lahu; Lisaw; Tai Lue; Tai Yai; and Yao (and others). The more remote villages still live in relative isolation, independent from Thai society, though all are integrated through various government agencies including healthcare and education.
