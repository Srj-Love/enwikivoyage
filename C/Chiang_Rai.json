English is spoken reasonably well. It is a 300 m walk to a main road, and close to the bus station and night market. You can drop laundry some 300 m up the road, give them your hotel details, and they will return it by evening if you put it in before 09:00 (they do not speak English). Another 50 m at the main road intersection is a restaurant where you can get a good Thai breakfast for under 100 baht, and a cheap dinner with beer also."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Ban Khun Yom"],["alt=บ้านขุนยม"],["url="],["email="],["address=155 Thanalai Rd"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+66 53 716216"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=600-800 baht"],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=42 rooms."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Ban Silp"],["alt=(บ้านศิลป์"],["url="],["email="],["address=260\/44 Moo 15 Sankongnoi Rd"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+66 53 756335-6"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=300-600 baht"],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=27 rooms."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Ban Suan Nanglae Resort"],["alt=บ้านสวนนางแล รีสอร์ท"],["url="],["email="],["address=298 Moo 5 Phahonyothin Rd"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=km851"],["phone=+66 53 772490-1"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=600-800 baht"],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=60 rooms."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=City Home"],["url=http:\/\/www.cityhomethailand.com"],["email=Cityhome.chiangrai@yahoo.com"],["address=868 Phahonyothin Rd"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Near Night Market and bus station"],["phone=+66 53 600155"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=600 baht"],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=20 rooms, fan\/air, cable TV.
