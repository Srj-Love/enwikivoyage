Chiang Saen’s rich culture has been influenced by its collection of Buddhist scriptures and temples. It was once the provincial capital.

Once officially unrecognized by the Thai government, Doi Mae Salong is a Chinese KMT (Kuomintang) area renowned for its natural beauty and unique Yunnanese culture.

Many visitors go with a certified guide, but other simply go on their own. It is possible to stay overnight with the villagers. Solo travellers not going with a guide are advised to stay with the village headmen; a small donation is welcome.\n\nSadly, some opportunists exploit hill tribe people to extract money from tourists.

Most tourists (and backpackers) have already paid this price in their tour package, thinking that 1,000 baht or more for a day trip is \"cheap\". Needless to say, the poor Burmese Karens working there for tourists, get only a tiny fraction of the money. Their home, Burma (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Myanmar"]]},"), is one of the poorest countries of the world. Be aware that this is just a tourist trap. It's better to visit a remote, but genuine, Karen village, than to help rich people make money from the poor.\n\nWhen trekking off the beaten track and away from hill tribes, it is possible to sleep at any temple, but again a little donation is appreciated.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Doi Chaang Coffee"],["url=http:\/\/doichaangcoffee.com\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=North of Mae Suai"],["phone=+1 604 689 3312"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Great coffee grown and roasted in the mountains.
