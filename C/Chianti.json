It is not an administrative region and includes parts of the Tuscan provinces of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Florence (province)"],["Florence"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Siena (province)"],["Siena"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Arezzo (province)"],["Arezzo"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pisa (province)"],["Pisa"]]},". The Chianti DOCG appellation is divided into seven subregions (Classico, Colli Aretini, Colli Fiorentini, Colline Pisane, Colli Senesi, Montalbano and Rufina), of which Classico is the most famous.\n\nThe Chianti Classico region in turn is defined by the towns between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Florence"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Siena"]]},": ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Greve"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Panzano in Chianti"],["Panzano"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Castellina in Chianti"],["Castellina"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gaiole in Chianti"],["Gaiole"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Radda in Chianti"],["Radda"]]},". Almost all the famous Chianti estates are located near one of these towns, although ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rufina"]]}," is to the East of Florence.\n\nIn addition to the red wine, many producers make the dessert wine Vin Santo del Chianti as well as \"Super Tuscan\" wines that do not adhere to the DOC regulations. Some also make olive oil.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nFrom abroad, usually the best way to reach Chianti is to fly to an airport in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tuscany"]]},", such as the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pisa"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Florence"]]}," airport, or some other major airport in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Italy"]]},". Alternatively, from Central Europe one might want to take a train to Italy. Once in Italy and preferably in Tuscany, you have to find your way to Florence; this will be easy as the city has good train connections to the rest of the country. From Florence there are several alternatives to get to Chianti: rental car, bus, taxi, etc.\n\nPrecise instructions are difficult to give since it depends so much on from where you are departing and exactly where you will be staying (in Florence, in Siena, in Greve, or some other place in the region).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nChianti is easiest to explore with a car. The most likely place to begin the trip is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Florence"]]},", where rental services are abundant. The most important road to know is the ",{"type":"''","value":["Chiantigiana"]}," from Florence to Siena, as it penetrates the heart of the region, Chianti Classico.\n\nWithout car, the region is accessible with SITA buses from Florence. \nThe hills of Chianti are a magnificent place for bike tours. Cycling you can enjoy at best the beautiful landscape of this region.\nYou will rarely be cycling in flat roads, but you will also seldom have to climb steep passes (only, be ware of the hot hours of the day in the Summer).\nYou can start from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Greve"]]},", for example, where you can rent a bike.\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nFor someone interested in museums, churches and such things it is not necessary to leave Florence or Siena. However, the Chianti area can be an excellent base from which to explore Tuscany as whole without having to stay in these crowded cities. The countryside is beautiful, and absolute gems that should be visited are the hamlets of Montefioralle and Volpaia, and the beautiful towns of Greve, Panzano, Radda and Castellina.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Wine-growing holding in the Chianti region.jpg"],["thumb"],["Wine-growing holding in the Chianti"]]},"\n\nThe region is an invaluable treasure for those who are interested in exploring the eno-gastronomic culture of Tuscany.\n\n",{"type":"''","value":["See also: ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wine tourism#Italy"]]}]},"\n\nWith serious competition only from a few neighboring regions in Tuscany and from Piedmont, Chianti is one of Italy's prime wine regions. The best way to tour the wineries and sample their products is on the last Sunday of May when many producers throughout Italy open their doors for the festival of ",{"type":"''","value":["Cantine Aperte"]},". Tastings are free and reservations unnecessary, so if you like wine and happen to be in Tuscany at the time, this is a fantastic opportunity for you. You should however keep in mind that not all the wine produced in Chianti is exceptional and that some of the best producers do not even participate in ",{"type":"''","value":["Cantine Aperte"]},", so it makes sense to plan ahead and be choosy.\n\nOlive groves are also the region's pride, and while it is not normally possible to visit an oil press, olive oil can be purchased directly from the producers. Olives are pressed in November and December and the ",{"type":"''","value":["olio nuovo"]}," or new oil, which is very piquant for the first several months, is especially prized on ",{"type":"''","value":["bruschetta"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["ribollita"]},".\n\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]}," \n\nIf you want to go to Chianti, the natural assumption is that you want to drink the wine. It is made with the ",{"type":"''","value":["sangiovese"]}," grape, although lesser quantities of other grape varieties may be added. There are different philosophies of making Chianti: some prefer traditional blends with ",{"type":"''","value":["sangiovese"]}," and other local grapes (including white ones), some use international varieties such as ",{"type":"''","value":["merlot"]},", and finally there are those who use only ",{"type":"''","value":["sangiovese"]}," for their Chianti.\n\nThe taste of the wine depends a lot on the producer's decisions, but also on the exact place where the vines are grown. ",{"type":"''","value":["Sangiovese"]}," is known as a rather difficult grape to grow, and differences in the land affect the taste of the resulting wine. Traditionally Chianti is a light wine with high acidity with a slightly bitter but fruity taste and berry aromas. As international markets demand high-fruit, high-alcohol wines, Chianti is changing as well, and more modern versions have a fuller, although less recognizable taste.\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nThere are lots of lovely hill-top towns in Chianti with plenty of good hotels and B&B's. However, if you want to get away from the traffic and noise, then this is your chance to stay in one of dozens of 'agriturismi' in the area, working farms that also rent out apartments or rooms to travellers who would like to experience at close hand the Chianti countryside. It makes good sense to pick a central location and to use this as a base for your trips to Florence and Siena, as well as your trips to the beautiful towns and villages, like Castellina in Chianti, San Gimignano, Panzano, Radda, and so on.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]}," \n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Tuscany"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usableregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["43.68376"],["10.93826"],["zoom=10"]]},"\n"]
