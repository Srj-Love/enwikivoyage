If you are on your way to Alishan, note that it is not necessary to stay in Chiayi, as buses leave quite frequently and the city itself is not particularly interesting.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nHSR Chiayi (Taibao) station is on the high-speed line between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Taipei"]]}," (1:30 hours, $1080) and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kaohsiung"]]},".  The HSR station is over 15 km out of town, but linked to the city by the Chiayi BRT system.\n\nChiayi is also served by mainline TRA trains and the scenic narrow-gauge Alishan Forest Railway to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alishan"]]},", which both leave from the same station, but have separate ticketing counters.  Long-distance buses leave from the terminal immediately outside the station, but local buses (notably those to nearby hot spring town ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guanzihling"]]},") use the Zhongshan Rd bus terminal a few hundred meters down the street.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Chiayi Bus Rapid Transit"]}," (BRT) ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cibus.com.tw\/"]}," system has three lines, with the main line linking the HSR and TRA railway stations.  The trip between the two takes around 30 minutes (NT$40, exact change - no charge if going directly between the HSR & TRA stations), but note that the BRT stop is on the rear side of the TRA station, so you need to take the pedestrian bridge to cross to the other side.  The location of the TRA station is not obvious from the BRT stop.  If coming from the direction of the HSR railway, after you get off at the stop, cross to the other side of the street at the intersection you have just passed.  The \"back station\" area is still under construction - bear to the right and you should find the pedestrian bridge.\n\nBuses have announcements and signage in English as well as Chinese.\n\nTaxis are plentiful, especially around the train stations, and some pidgin English is spoken.\n\nBuses to Alisan cos about NT$250 one way, and can be bought at the bus station next to the train station. The ride takes 2.5 hours. There are also some gypsy cabs that will drive you to Alisan, too.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThe best way to get to know Chiayi is to take a walk down Culture Road, and not just once but a few times, back and forth. There are also two movie theaters where you can experience watching both Western movies and Chinese-language movies in a theater packed with local Taiwanese viewers, young and old. There is a good bookstore called Hon-too Bookstore with a wide range of English-language magazines which you can peruse at your leisure. For some quiet downtime, Chiayi Park and Botanical Gardens are a lovely way to spend the afternoon.  The Botanical Gardens provide pleasant trails that weave you through a large variety of plants and trees native to the area.  Ponds hold Japanese koi fish, turtles, and frogs. Chiayi park is well-maintained and serves as a center of activity for local adults—and senior citizens—and children from 5 am to late in the afternoon.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nDo visit the 1931 Kano baseball museum, which houses old photographs of the famous Chiayi high school team from 1931.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nCulture Road (site of the \"Wunhua Rd Night Market\", see below) is Chiayi's main shopping street. Another shopping street, but more commercial and less cool, is Zhongshan Road (中山路) which stretches from the main train station to a roundabout public fountain area at Culture Road.\nOne specialty chain store that's located on Zhongshang Road is the \"Guang Nan\" (光南), which sells small electronics and other media-related goods. Catch a good deal on cables and computer accessories here, along with VCDs of Taiwan dramas\/Japanese anime\/American films (subtitled in traditional Chinese).\n\nThere are two night markets in Chiayi, but the most famous and the best is the Culture Road night market. The other night market, also fun and tasty, is the Carrefour Night Market next to the Carrefour store along Bo Ai Road.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:TurkeyRiceChiayiTaiwan.jpg"],["thumb"],["It's turkey!
