",{"type":"[[","value":[["Illinois"]]}," before European settlers arrived. It was mostly swamps, prairie and mud long past the establishment of Fort Dearborn in 1803 and incorporation as a town in 1833. It could be argued that nature never intended for there to be a city here; brutal winters aside, it took civil engineering projects of unprecedented scale to establish working sewers, reverse the flow of the river to keep it out of the city's drinking supply, and stop buildings from sinking back into the swamps — and that was just the first few decades.\n\nBy 1871, the reckless growth of the city was a sight to behold, full of noise, Gothic lunacy, and bustling commerce. But on October 8, Mrs. O'Leary's cow reportedly knocked over a lantern in the crowded immigrant quarters in the West Side, and the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Great Chicago Fire"]}," began. It quickly spread through the dry prairie, killing 300 and destroying virtually the entire city. The stone Water Tower in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chicago\/Near North"],["Near North"]]}," is the most famous surviving structure. But the city seized this destruction as an opportunity to rebuild bigger than before, giving canvas for several architects and urban planners who would go on to become legends of modern architecture.\n\nAt the pinnacle of its rebirth and the height of its newfound powers, Chicago was known as ",{"type":"'''","value":["The White City"]},". Cultures from around the world were summoned to the 1893 World's Colombian Exposition, to bear witness to the work of Louis Sullivan, Daniel Burnham, and the future itself. Cream of Wheat, soft drinks, street lights and safe electricity, the fax machine, and the Ferris Wheel bespoke the colossus now resident on the shores of Lake Michigan.\n\nAs every road had once led to Rome, every train led to Chicago. Carl Sandburg called Chicago the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hog Butcher for the World"]}," for its cattle stockyards and place on the nation's dinner plate. Sandburg also called it the ",{"type":"'''","value":["City of the Big Shoulders"]},", noting the tall buildings in the birthplace of the skyscraper — and the city's \"lifted head singing so proud to be alive and coarse and strong and cunning.\" But Chicago is a city in no short supply of nicknames. Fred Fisher's 1922 song (best known in Frank Sinatra's rendition) calls it ",{"type":"'''","value":["That Toddlin' Town"]},", where \"on State Street, that great street, they do things they don't do on Broadway.\" It's also referenced by countless blues standards like ",{"type":"'''","value":["Sweet Home Chicago"]},".\n\nChicago is also known as ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Second City"]},", which refers to its rebuilding after the fire — the current city is literally the second Chicago, after the one that disappeared in 1871. The moniker has stuck, in no small part due to its popular association with the city's long-held former position as the United States' second largest city. And many know the nickname from Chicago's great comedy theater in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chicago\/Lincoln Park-Old Town"],["Old Town"]]},".\n\nChicago's history with corruption is legendary. During the Prohibition era, Chicago's criminal world, emblemized by names like Al Capone, Baby Face Nelson, and later Sam Giancana, practically ran the city. The local political world had scarcely more legitimacy in a town where voter turnout was highest among the dead and their pets, and precinct captains spread the word to \"vote early, vote often.\" Even Sandburg acknowledged the relentless current of vice that ran under the surface of the optimistic city.\n\nToday, Chicago is known as ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Windy City"]},". Walking around town, you might suspect that Chicago got this nickname from the winds off Lake Michigan, which shove through the downtown corridors with intense force. But the true origin of the saying comes from politics. Some say it may have been coined by rivals like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cincinnati"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New York City"],["New York"]]}," as a derogatory reference to the Chicagoan habit of rabid boosterism and endless political conventions. Others say that the term originated from the fact that Chicago politicians change their minds \"as often as the wind.\" Yet another saying is that the name came about because of Chicago's long-winded politicians.\n\nFinally, the city is known as ",{"type":"'''","value":["The City That Works"]},", as promoted by longtime Mayor Richard M. Daley, which refers to Chicago's labor tradition, the long hours worked by its residents, and its willingness to tackle grand civic projects. Daley and his father, former Mayor Richard J. Daley, ruled the city for decades in what can only be described as a benevolent dictatorship; as other Midwestern manufacturing cities like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cleveland"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Detroit"]]}," went into decline, Chicago thrived, transforming from a city of stockyards and factories to a financial giant at the forefront of modern urban design. Former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel became mayor of Chicago in 2011.\n\nWhile the city has many great attractions downtown, most Chicagoans live and play outside of the central business district. To understand Chicago, travelers must venture away from the Loop and Michigan Avenue and out into the vibrant neighborhoods, to soak up the local nightlife, sample the wide range of fantastic dining, and see the sights Chicagoans alone know and love — thanks to the city's massive public transit system, every part of Chicago is only slightly off the most beaten path.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Imperial"],["janhigh =   29"],["febhigh =   34"],["marhigh =   45"],["aprhigh =   58"],["mayhigh =   70"],["junhigh =   80"],["julhigh =   84"],["aughigh =   82"],["sephigh =   75"],["octhigh =   63"],["novhigh =   48"],["dechigh =   35"],["janlow =   13"],["feblow =   18"],["marlow =   28"],["aprlow =   39"],["maylow =   48"],["junlow =   57"],["jullow =   63"],["auglow =   62"],["seplow =   54"],["octlow =   42"],["novlow =   31"],["declow =   20"],["janprecip =  1.7"],["febprecip =  1.4"],["marprecip =  2.7"],["aprprecip =  3.6"],["mayprecip =  3.2"],["junprecip =  3.8"],["julprecip =  3.6"],["augprecip =  4.1"],["sepprecip =  3.5"],["octprecip =  2.6"],["novprecip =  2.9"],["decprecip =  2.2"],["description = ",{"type":"{{","value":[["ForecastNOAA"],["Chicago"],["41.878644"],["-87.6358859"]]}]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Coldchicago.jpg"],["300px"],["thumb"],["Insider tip: Winter + Snow + Wind = Chicago."]]},"\nWeather is definitely not one of the attractions in Chicago. There's a good time to be had in any season, but it is a place where the climate has to be taken into consideration.\n\nA little-known fact: despite Chicago's winters, there are more days with a maximum temperature of between 80-84°F (27-29°C) than any other five-degree range. Obscured by Chicago's ferocious winters are the heat waves of summer. The days in July and August that go above the \"normal\" are oftentimes disgustingly hot and humid, and dewpoints can be similar to those found closer to the Gulf of Mexico. The city's surprisingly attractive lakefront beaches can relieve some of the swelter. Summer nights are usually reasonable, though, and you'll get a few degrees' respite along the lakefront — in the local parlance, that's \"cooler by the lake.\"\n\nBut then there are those winters. The months from December to March will see very cold temperatures, with even more bitter wind chill factors. Snow is usually limited to a handful of heavy storms per season, with a few light dustings in-between. (And a little more along the lakefront — again in the local parlance, that's \"lake effect snow\".) Ice storms are also a risk. It's a city that's well-accustomed to these winters, though, so city services and public transportation are highly unlikely to shut down.\n\nThat said, Chicago does have a few nice months of weather. May and September are pleasant and mild; April and June are mostly fine, although thunderstorms with heavy winds can also occur suddenly. Although there may be a slight chill in the air in October, it rarely calls for more than a light coat and some days that's not even necessary. In some years, the warmth stored by the lake may prolong a pleasant autumn into November.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Literature"]},"\nChicago literature found its roots in the city's tradition of lucid, direct journalism, lending to a strong tradition of social realism.

Block numbers are consistent across the whole city. Standard blocks, of 100 addresses each, are roughly 1\/8th of a mile long. (Hence, a mile is equivalent to a street number difference of 800.) Each street is assigned a number based on its distance from the zero point of the address system, the intersection of State Street and Madison Street. A street with a W (west) or E (east) number runs east-west, while a street with a N (north) or S (south) number runs north-south. A street's number is usually written on street signs at intersections, below the street name. Major thoroughfares are at each mile (multiples of 800) and secondary arteries at the half-mile marks. Thus, Western Ave at 2400 W (3 miles west of State Street) is a north-south major thoroughfare, while Montrose Ave at 4400 N is an east-west secondary artery.\n\nIn general, \"avenues\" run north-south and \"streets\" run east-west, but there are numerous exceptions.  (e.g., 48th Street may then be followed by 48th Place). In conversation, however, Chicagoans rarely distinguish between streets, avenues, boulevards, etc.\n\nSeveral streets follow diagonal or meandering paths through the city such as Clark St, Lincoln Ave, Broadway, Milwaukee Ave, Ogden Ave, Archer Ave, Vincennes Ave, and South Chicago Ave.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By public transit"]},"\nThe best way to see Chicago is by public transit.

Even if you have the option of driving while you're in town, no experience of Chicago is complete without a trip on the CTA.\n\nTrain rides of any length, from one side of the city to another or just one stop, cost $2.25 (save for rides originating at the O'Hare Blue Line station, which cost $5). At certain stations, you can transfer to other train lines at no extra cost. Once you have exited the turnstiles, entering another CTA station or boarding a CTA bus costs $0.25, and doing it a third time is free, provided it is still within two hours of when you started the trip.\n\nTrain fares must be paid with ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ventra Tickets"]},", which can be purchased and re-filled at kiosks in the lobby of every CTA train station. Purchasing a ticket costs $3, which includes a one-time $0.50 fee. (Reloading the ticket for future trips can be done for any amount and will not require the $0.50 fee.) All kiosks accept cash and credit cards. Many locals use the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ventrachicago.com\/ Ventra Card"]}]},", which can be purchased at stations.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Visitor Passes"]}," are sold for unlimited travel on the CTA: 1 day (24 hours) for $10; 3 days for $20; 7 days for $28 and 30 days for $100.

Tickets for single rides or larger increments can also be purchased on-line. Tickets, cards, 30-day passes, and a special 7-day CTA\/Pace pass ($33) can also be used on the suburban Pace bus system.  None of these instruments can be used on the suburban Metra or South Shore train systems.\n\nThe CTA officially refers to its entire train system as ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.transitchicago.com\/riding_cta\/service_overview.aspx The 'L'"]},". The CTA inherited the name from its predecessor agencies that ran elevated trains, but now refers to all trains, including subways, as The 'L'. All train lines radiate from the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chicago\/Loop"],["Loop"]]}," to every corner of the city. The \"Loop\" name originally referred to a surface-level streetcar loop, which pre-dated the elevated tracks. That ",{"type":"''","value":["any"]}," form of transportation preceded the present one may come as a surprise, given how old some of the stations look, but they work.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Ctabus.jpg"],["thumb"],["240px"],["A CTA bus - note the number\/destination and symbol for wheelchair accessibility"]]},"\nCTA train lines are divided by colors: Red, Green, Brown, Blue, Purple, Yellow, Orange and Pink. All lines lead to the Loop except the Yellow Line, which provides service between the suburb of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Skokie"]]}," and the northern border of Chicago. The Red and Blue lines run 24\/7, every day of the year, making Chicago and New York City the two American cities, and one of a handful worldwide, to offer 24-hour rail service within the city. Hours for the other lines vary somewhat by the day, but as a general rule run from about 4:30AM–1:00AM. A few major stations have trackers noting the times when the next trains will arrive, but most do not.\n\nBefore you travel, find out the name of the train stop closest to your destination, and the color of the train line on which it is located. Once you're on board, you'll usually find route maps in each train car, above the door (although they are often stolen). The same map is also available ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/transitchicago.com\/maps\/maps\/fwebmaptrain.gif online"]},". The name signs on platforms often have the station's location in the street grid, e.g. \"5900 N, 1200 W\" for Thorndale.\n\nThere should be an attendant on duty at every train station.

Look for the blue and white sign, which should give a map of the route taken by the bus and major streets\/stops along the way. Once inside, watch the front of the bus, a red LED display will list the names of upcoming streets where stops are located, making it easy to stop exactly where you want, even a small side street. To request a stop, pull the cord hanging above the window and make sure you hear an audible 'ding'. Hollering at the bus driver will raise tempers but works in a pinch.\n\nBus rides of any length cost $2 with a Ventra Ticket or Card or $2.25 in cash. Major bus routes run 7–15 minutes apart during daylight hours, depending on the route. Less-traveled routes or routes during off-peak hours may run less frequently. Check the sign to be sure the bus is still running. There are several bus routes that are  24\/7; these are called OWL routes, and the signs usually have an owl to belabor that point. (See individual district articles for major bus routes through different parts of the city.)\n\nIf you have a web-enabled mobile device, the CTA runs a little godsend called the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/ctabustracker.com\/bustime\/home.jsp CTA Bus Tracker"]}]},", which uses GPS to provide reliable, real-time tracking information for almost all bus routes. Some bus shelters are equipped with real-time bus trackers of their own.\n\nCTA buses accept Ventra Tickets but do not sell them. They also accept cash but do not provide change. You must pay exact change, or forfeit your change by paying a rate equal to the smallest denomination of money you have.\n\nIn compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act, all CTA buses and some train stations are accessible to wheelchairs. Wheelchair-accessible 'L' stations are indicated by the international wheelchair symbol and have elevators or are at ground level. If you are trying to get to a place with a non-accessible station, there will be alternate routes by bus so contact the CTA for more information.\n\nCrime on the CTA is low, but as with any major urban area, travelers should be aware of their surroundings, especially when traveling in the wee hours of the night, and sit close to the driver if you feel uncomfortable for any reason. Buses are being equipped with video cameras as the fleet is upgraded. Some train cars have a button and speaker for emergency communication with the driver, located in the center aisle of the car on the wall next to the door. This is for emergencies only: do not press this just to chat, as the driver is required to halt the train until the situation has been confirmed as resolved, and your fellow passengers will not be amused.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Metra and South Shore"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Chicago metra near the loop.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Metra train on the way to the Loop"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Metra map.png"],["thumb"],["420px"],["Metra system map"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/metrarail.com\/ Metra"]}]},", ☎ +1 312 322-6777, runs commuter trains for the suburbs, providing service within Illinois, to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kenosha"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wisconsin"]]},", out west, and to the far south and southwest suburbs.

South Shore trains cannot carry passengers whose journey is entirely within the State of Illinois, except to and from the Hegewisch station on Chicago's far southeast side.  Although the South Shore Line receives some subsidies from Metra, it is not part of the Metra system and does not accept Metra or CTA tickets.\n\nAlthough there are plans to change this in the future, none of the commuter trains currently accept CTA fare cards as payment.

If you have a group of four or more people, it may be cheaper to purchase a ten-ride card and have all of your fares punched from that one card.

Pace accepts transfers from the CTA by passengers using a Transit Card or Chicago Card for the same fee as the CTA charges (25 cents for the second ride and free for the third ride within two hours).  Conversely, passengers paying with a Transit Card or Chicago Card receive transfer privileges onto CTA buses and trains under the same terms.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nAvoid driving in downtown Chicago if at all possible. Traffic is awful, pedestrians are constantly wandering into the street out of turn, and garages in the Loop can cost as much as $40 per day. And although downtown streets are laid out on the grid, many have multiple levels which confuse even the most hardened city driver. Even outside of the city center, street parking may not be readily available. If you do find a spot, check street signs to make sure that a) no residential permit is required to park here and b) parking is not disallowed during certain hours for \"street cleaning\", rush hour or something along those lines. Parking restrictions are swiftly and mercilessly enforced in the form of tickets and towing — be especially wary during snowy weather.\n\nParking is handled by one-per-block kiosks, which will issue a slip for you to put in your front window. The kiosks will accept cash or credit cards. If the kiosk fails for any reason (such as the printer running out of paper), there should be a phone number to call to report it and ensure you don't receive an undeserved ticket.

Born to a Haitian slave and a French pirate, he married a woman from the Potawatomi tribe, and built a house and trading post on the Chicago River on the spot of today's Pioneer Court (the square just south of the Tribune Tower in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chicago\/Near North"],["Near North"]]},"). Du Sable lived on the Chicago River with his family from the 1770s to 1800, when he sold his house to John Kinzie, whose family and friends would later claim to have founded the city.\n\nRelative to other northern cities, African-Americans constituted a fairly large part of Chicago's early population because of Illinois' more tolerant culture, which was inherited from fervent anti-slavery Mormon settlers. As a non-slave state generally lacking official segregation laws, Illinois was an attractive place to live for black freedmen and fugitive slaves.\n\nBy the 1920s, Chicago had a thriving middle class African-American community based in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chicago\/Bronzeville"],["Bronzeville"]]}," neighborhood, which at the time became known as \"The Black Metropolis,\" home to a cultural renaissance comparable to the better-known Harlem Renaissance of New York. African-American literature of the time was represented by local poetess ",{"type":"'''","value":["Gwendolyn Brooks"]}," and novelist ",{"type":"'''","value":["Richard Wright"]},", most famous for his ",{"type":"''","value":["Native Son"]},", nearly all of which takes place in Chicago's ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chicago\/Bronzeville"],["Bronzeville"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chicago\/Hyde Park"],["Hyde Park\/Kenwood"]]},". The Chicago school of African-American literature distinguished itself from the East Coast by its focus on the new realities of urban African-American life. Chicago became a ",{"type":"''","value":["major"]}," center of African-American jazz, and ",{"type":"''","value":["the"]}," center for the blues. Jazz great ",{"type":"'''","value":["Louis Armstrong"]}," got his start there; other famous black Chicagoans of the day included Bessie Coleman — the world's first licensed black pilot, the hugely influential African-American and women's civil rights activist ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ida B. Wells"]},", the great pitcher\/manager\/executive of Negro League Baseball ",{"type":"'''","value":["Andrew \"Rube\" Foster"]},", and many more.\n\nBoth fueling and threatening Chicago's black renaissance was the single most influential part of Chicago's African-American history: ",{"type":"'''","value":["the Great Migration"]},". African-Americans from the rural ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South (United States of America)"],["South"]]}," moved to the industrial cities of the North due to the post-WWI shortage of immigrant industrial labor, and to escape the Jim Crow Laws and racial violence of the South. The massive wave of migrants, most from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mississippi"]]},", increased Chicago's black population by more than 500,000. With it came southern food, Mississippi blues, and the challenges of establishing adequate housing for so many recent arrivals — a challenge that they would have to meet themselves, without help from a racist and neglectful city government.\n\nBlack Chicago's renaissance was brought to its knees by the Great Depression; its fate was sealed ironically by the 1937 creation of the Chicago Housing Authority, which sought to build affordable public housing for the city. However well-intentioned the project may have sounded, the results were disastrous. The largest housing projects by far were the 1940 Ida B. Wells projects, which were designed to \"warehouse\" Chicago's population of poor African-Americans in a district far away from white population centers, the Cabrini Green projects, which developed a reputation as the most violent housing projects in the nation, and the massive 1962 Robert Taylor Homes in Bronzeville, which were forced to house an additional 16,000 people beyond their intended 11,000 capacity. The Black Metropolis proved unable to cope with this massive influx of new, impoverished residents, and the urban blight that came from concentrating such a great number of them in one place.\n\nFurther damaging to Chicago's black population was the phenomenon of \"white flight\" that accompanied the introduction of African-Americans to Chicago neighborhoods. Unwilling to live beside black neighbors, many Chicagoans fled desegregation to the suburbs. This trend was accelerated by the practice of \"blockbusting,\" where unsavory real estate agents would fan racist fears in order to buy homes on the cheap. As a result, Chicago neighborhoods (with the notable exceptions of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chicago\/Hyde Park"],["Hyde Park\/Kenwood"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chicago\/Rogers Park"],["Rogers Park"]]},") never truly integrated, and the social, educational, and economic networks that incoming African-Americans hoped to join disintegrated in the wake of fleeing white communities. During this period, Chicago experienced a huge population loss and large sections of the city became covered with vacant lots, which in turn created the conditions for crime to flourish. A number of Chicago's major roads, most notably the Dan Ryan Expressway, were built in part to segregate these areas from more prosperous ones like the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chicago\/Loop"],["Loop"]]},".\n\nIn 1966, ",{"type":"'''","value":["Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr."]}," decided to come north and chose Chicago as his first destination. However, from the moment of his arrival on the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chicago\/Southwest Side"],["Southwest Side"]]},", King was utterly confounded. The death threats that followed his march through Marquette Park were challenge enough, but nowhere in the South was there a more expert player of politics than Chicago's Mayor Richard J. Daley. King left town frustrated and exhausted, but ",{"type":"'''","value":["Rev. Jesse Jackson"]}," continued civil rights efforts in Chicago through his Operation PUSH. The 1983 election of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mayor Harold Washington"]},", the first black mayor of Chicago, was a watershed event for Chicago's African-American population, and although long battles with obstructionist white politicians lay ahead, it marked the moment when African-American elected officials became major, independent forces in Chicago.\n\nToday, comprising well over a third of the city, Chicago's black population is the country's second largest, after New York. The broader South Side is the cultural center of Chicago's black community; it constitutes the largest single African-American neighborhood in the country and boasts the nation's greatest concentration of black-owned businesses. Chicagoans ignorant of these areas may tell you that they are dangerous and crime-ridden, but the reality is much more complex. There are strong, middle and upper class black communities throughout the city, some of the more prominent of which include ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chicago\/Bronzeville"],["upper Bronzeville"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chicago\/Hyde Park"],["Hyde Park\/Kenwood"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chicago\/Chatham-South Shore"],["Chatham"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chicago\/Chatham-South Shore"],["South Shore"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chicago\/Far Southwest Side"],["Beverly"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chicago\/Bronzeville"],["Bronzeville"]]}," is the obvious destination for those interested in African-American history, although Kenwood also boasts interesting recent history, as it has been (or is) home to championship boxer Muhammad Ali, Nation of Islam leaders Elijah Muhammad and Louis Farrakhan, and ",{"type":"'''","value":["President Barack Obama"]},".

The main focus of the sandwich is the beef, and serious vendors will serve meat of a surprisingly good quality, which is slow-roasted, and thinly shaved before being loaded generously onto chewy, white, Italian-style bread. Two sets of options will come flying at you, so prepare yourself: sweet peppers or hot, and dipped or not. The \"sweet\" peppers are sautéed bell peppers, while the hots are a mixed Chicago giardiniera. The dip, of course, is a sort of French dip of the sandwich back into the beef broth. (Warning: dipped Italian Beefs are sloppy!)

However, if you have a specific interest in mind, there are hotels throughout the city, and getting away from downtown will give you more of a sense of other neighborhoods. You'll appreciate that if you're in town for more than a couple of days. Make sure that where you're staying is within your comfort level before committing to stay there, though. More far flung transient hotels will be suitable for those seeking to relive Jack Kerouac's seedy adventures around the country, but may alarm and disgust the average traveler.\n\nBudget-priced places are usually pretty far from the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chicago\/Loop"],["Loop"]]},", so when you're booking, remember that Chicago is vast.

Even in a neighborhood with a bad reputation, though, you might still have a perfectly good time, as long as it falls within your comfort level.\n\nTake caution in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chicago\/Loop"],["Loop"]]}," at night; after working hours, the Loop gets quiet and dark in a hurry west of State Street, but you'll be fine near hotels and close to Michigan Avenue and the lake.

If you simply ignore them and walk away they should leave you alone. Not often, but some will continue to follow and harass you. If this happens, go inside any restaurant or store until they leave.\n\nIn general, common sense will keep you safe in Chicago: avoid unfamiliar side streets at night, stay out of alleys at night, know where you're going when you set out, stick to crowded areas, and keep a $20 bill on hand for cab fare as a bail-out option.\n\nDress appropriately for the weather. Chicago's winter is famously windy and cold, so cover exposed skin and wear layers in the winter, but heat exhaustion is an equal risk in the summer months, especially July and August.
