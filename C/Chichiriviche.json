From \"Chichi\" there are boats to half a dozen neighboring cays.

Note that most of them will drop you off at the last intersection, where usually shared taxis to Chichi are waiting (10 minutes, 5 BsF p.p.). Note that prices are due to rise fast because of the high inflation of around 30% p.a. Given prices are from July 2011.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nThe town is small, and everything can be reached by walking. The beaches in Chichi itself are not recommended, as they tend to be very dirty. So your best bet is to visit one of the neighboring islands. 3 options for this:\n\n- official boat: there's a counter at the corniche, prices per boat (two-way) range from BsF 150 (Isla Muerto) to BsF 450 (Isla Pescadores)\n\n- unofficial boat: you will find hawkers everywhere which offer the same trips for 50 BsF less\n\n- hotel: some hotels organize boat trips their selves, which is much cheaper (e.g. Isla Sal is ~50 BsF p.P.)\n\nMain islands:\nCayo Muerto, Cayo Sal: nearest and most visited islands; food and drinks are available, benches and umbrellas cost around 80-90 BsF for the day. Can get quite crowded and littered especially on weekends\n\nCaya Peraza, Cayo Pelon, Cayo Veradura are maybe better options to avoid the crowds\n\nCayo Sombrero is said to be the best island for coral diving and snorkeling; together with Cayo Pescadores the most distant islands, the beaches farther south should be accessed by ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tucacas"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nBesides chilling on the beaches many birds can be found in the Golfete de Cuare.

Both serve sea food in the range of BsF 100 and other meat dishes in the range of 50-70 BsF.\nSome hotels and most posadas don't include breakfast.
