The name has a grain of truth in it: not only does the lake, which has an area of 80 square kilometres, have tides like the sea, it also originated from the primeval Thetis Sea which once covered almost half of Europe. \n\nAmong its attractions are the island of Herrenchiemsee with its  palaces, the monastery on  Frauenchiemsee and  Julius Exter's House in Feldwies. The Chiemsee is under the protection of the international Ramsar Convention, which was founded to preserve ecologically important wetlands. Since 1954 the mudflats in the delta formed where the Tiroler Ache flows into the lake have been a protected retreat for many endangered species of waterfowl and wader.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Café im Neuen Schloss on the Herreninsel.
