The air is clean.  Take a beige umbrella, not the black one.  Have a nice cotton Tilley-style hat with a wide brim.

No metered one exists yet.  Patiently negotiate the price before you get in.  Local people are very helpful and may negotiate a good price for both parties.\n\nDrivers in buses run by private operators are very solicitous.  The bus driver will drop you off wherever you want.

It is about 15 km to the foot of the hill and the winding road with exciting hairpin bends to the top is about 7 km.  There is an excellent botonical garden on the plateau at the top with a perimeter pathway that offers spectacular views of the surrounding country.  The two State of Karnataka Guest Houses and Hotel Mayura provide good lodging facilities including Western style bathrooms.  The restaurant in Hotel Mayura offers a good menu while the other \"hole-in-the-wall\" restaurant offers some food.  There is a modest \"Guest House\" where Mahatma Gandhi stayed that has become something of a pilgrimage centre and provides concrete evidence of Gandhi's simple life.  Some may enjoy the ambience of the Yoganandishwara Temple.  The wireless Police Control Room is there for emergencies.  Buses run regularly betweeen Bangalore and the top of Nandi Hill.  At less regular intervals, with the patience of Job, one can take a bus from Chikballapur to the top of Nandi Hill.\n\nAnother Nice Place is ",{"type":"'''","value":["WaterFalls"]}," in Chikkballapur Namely ",{"type":"[[","value":[[{"type":"'''","value":["Vivekananda falls"]}]]}," belongs to KethenaHalli Village of chikkballapur district.It is Approximately 12km from the city .we have to go through kethenahalli and just 1 km from that village we hav to walk in that route, as vehicles can't go .

The stone statue of Vishnu is simply splendid.  The black stone sculpture carved in the Vijaynagar style is best viewed when there are no other visitors to the temple.  The temple priest is more than willing to accommodate a special viewing for a small consideration offered to the deity.  Please respect the religious sensibilities, but go there for sheer artistic splendour.\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Heritage Primary School"]}," in Kandavara, about two km south of downtown Chikballapur on State Highway 74, may be of interest to history buffs.  Bharata Ratna Mokshagundam Vishweshwaraiah did his primary schooling in the U-shaped 1845 building.  The Dwaraknath Reddy Ramanarpanam Trust (DRRT), under the leadership of Anita Reddy, rehabilitated the building in 2006.  An effort has been made to create a modest interpretive center in one of the classrooms.

The Lord is sitting on top of Kurma giri (tortoise shaped hill). The 618 steps climb has greenery on either side. The scenic beauty, lake and greenery all around is a real feast to the eyes.

The redeeming value of \"taking it with you\" is that you can take it back with you as well.\n\nLocal people are very friendly and helpful.  If there are women in the climbing team, they may even offer you a hot drink that they call coffee.\n\nThere is hardly any public transport, just like the rest of India. You can either take motorcycle or rent a car. Parking fees should be less than or at most Rs. 50. The locals are known to exploit any unsuspecting stranger, so ",{"type":"'''","value":["beware"]}," of fraudulent parking area manager, fraudulent guides and vehicle thieves. In fact, the village at the bottom of the hill is known as Kalwarahalli Betta (Kalwara=Thieves, Halli=Village, Betta=Hill). There has been many reports of engine, carburetor,  helmet or even petrol theft. Thieves pretending to be guides will charge you Rs. 300 to Rs. 800 for walking through a straight road for some 100 meters. Some will take you at the top of hill as well for 50\/person (they may ask more) but the best adventure is to find your own way. They are probably in cahoots with the police so simply avoid them. Go in groups of atleast 5 people and get sticks which will help you to climb hill and also protect you from any animals(monkeys). Remember to get light torches (1 per person atleast) during night.\n\nSince some people fell down the steep hill while drunk, night trek is sometimes not allowed. You should find out about that beforehand. If you are not against working around the system, you can mostly maneuver around the couple of police grunts by going through the fields and directly head on to the trek without much problem.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\nGreater Chikballapur Area is not known for unique folk art or any other touristy item worthy of mention.  Although Chikballapur is known for silviculture, it is difficult to find silk scarves or anything like it for gift-giving.\n\nFor those tourists who suffer from withdrawal symptoms if they do not buy something every day of their travel, the best option is to ask locals for a craft store.\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["buy"],["name=Skandagiri"],["url="],["email="],["address=From chickballapur to 8 Km"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=VIia Nandi Road"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=15Minutes"],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nIt is best to stick to vegetarian food when you are in the Greater Chikballapur Area (GCA).

The precautinary rule applies: wash\/rinse even fruits with skins, with the boiled water from your bottle.

Sometimes, the tender coconut pulp inside can be delicious but the taste depends upon the season and when the coconut was harvested.\n\nIt is best to avoid bottled water altogether, for a variety of reasons.  If you are nice, someone will bring tap water to a rolling boil for 90 seconds, cool it, and serve it you.  You can then fill your water bottle with the boiled water for the day.

You may be better off buying the beverages in Bengaluru and transporting them with you.\n\nThe warm beer in Chikballapur has given a new meaning to the English warm beer.  The medicine-like English beer is usually at 21 degrees Celsius whereas warm beer in Chikballapur can be at 30 degrees plus Celsius.  Please cool it in your picnic cooler basket with ice cubes before tasting.\n\nMany in Chikballapur have a different concept of chilled white wine and room temperature red wine.  Please manage your temperature preference with the help of a good picnic cooler.  The same rule applies for all soft drinks that are readily available in Chikballapur.\n\nPlease do not use the ice cubes bought in a store in your liquor.  It is quite a nuisance to boil water, cool it, freeze it into cubes, and then take it with you in a separate plastic bag.  Sometimes accepting nuisances now can save you a lot of grief later.
