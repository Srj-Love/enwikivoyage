A little-known stop along the drive from Blantyre to Chikwawa, just 20 km south of Blantyre, is \"Fisherman's Rest\" -- a privately owned nature & game reserve, tea house, gift shop, and resthouse.\n\nTo get there, simply follow the Chikwawa Road (M1) south from Blantyre for 20 km to Mirale. As you begin to go down the escarpment the lodge is signposted on the right, followed by the park entrance 200 metres further down the road.\n\nThe nature reserve is open sunrise to sunset and accessed by foot. Wildlife includes several species of antelope, kudu, impala, nyala, bush buck, grysbok and duiker. The lodge and cottage hosts up to 12 residents where a swimming pool and gorgeous view, as well as food service or self catering are available.\n\n",{"type":"''","value":["Contact details:"]}," http:\/\/www.fishermansrest.net \/ enquiries@fishermansrest.net \/ Phone: 08836753 \/\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Southern Malawi"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Chikwawa"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["-16.035"],["34.801"]]}]
