But few such hamlets have what Childs has: a top-notch restaurant housed in an old stagecoach stop, comfortable bed-and-breakfast-style accommodations, and a unique museum complex steeped in history.\n\nThe hamlet was first known as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Fair Haven"]},", so named by founder ",{"type":"'''","value":["John Proctor"]},", who hoped to establish a thriving village at the most significant crossroads in the area.

Before long, a church was built, then a one-room schoolhouse—both making good use of the plentiful ",{"type":"'''","value":["cobblestones"]}," left behind by the retreating glaciers.  Several houses in the hamlet also made use of cobblestone construction.\n\nToday, the Ridge remains a major arterial route, though it carries cars and trucks rather than stagecoaches, and the old tavern is still in use as a modern-day watering hole.  The school and the church are the centerpieces of ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Cobblestone Museum"]},", which aims to preserve that unique style of architecture for future generations.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Map - Childs NY.png"],["right"],["350px"],["thumb"],["You probably don't need this map to get around."]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nChilds sits at the crossroads of New York State Routes 104 and 98.
