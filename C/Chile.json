Although Chile declared independence in 1810, decisive victory over the Spanish was not achieved until 1818. In the War of the Pacific (1879–83), Chile invaded parts of Peru and Bolivia and kept its present northern regions. It was not until the 1880s that the Araucanians were completely subjugated. Although relatively free of the coups and arbitrary governments that blighted South America, Chile endured the 17-year military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet (1973–1990) that left around  3,000 people, mostly leftists and socialist sympathizers, dead or disappeared.\n\nPinochet was widely reviled worldwide for his methods, however, a Center-Left Chilean administration came into power after he stepped down when he lost a national referendum. The new government of Patricio Aylwin thought it sensible to maintain free market policies that present-day Chile still harbors. Despite enjoying a comparatively higher GDP and more robust economy compared to most other countries of Latin America, Chile currently has one of the most uneven distributions of wealth in the world, ahead only of Brazil in the Latin American region and even lagging behind most developing sub-Saharan African nations. Chile's top 10 richest percentile possesses almost 42 percent of the country's total wealth. In relation to income distribution, some 6.2% of the country populates the upper economic income bracket, 19% the middle bracket, 24% the lower middle, 38% the lower bracket, and 13% the extreme poor.\n\nChile is a founding member of both United Nations and the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) and is also now in the OECD, the group of the \"most developed\" countries by current international standards, becoming the first country in South America with that honor.\n\nArgentina's and Chile's claims to Antarctica overlap.

The program provides volunteers a home-stay with a Chilean family, meals, a participation bonus of 60,000CLP for each month of completed service, health insurance, TEFL training, and access to an online Spanish course. There is no fee for participation.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nLike most big cities in South America, Santiago suffers from a high rate of pickpocketing and muggings. It's advisable not to travel in the downtown area wearing expensive-looking jewelry or watches, even during the day. Stay alert and be especially careful in all crowded areas in Santiago. It is recommended to wear your backpack at the front of your body in crowded areas. If you have a laptop it can be relaxing being outside in a café doing some work but thieves may see you. For your safety, go to an internet café if you need to be connected and leave your laptop at home. It will save you from losing it and it can rescue you from a violent attack from thieves. However, it is much safer to be inside the Metro stations, where you can even use free wi-fi hot spots in Universidad de Chile (L1) and Baquedano (L1-L5 junction) stations.\n\nFor tourists or other \"beginners\" lacking experience in over-the-counter transactions with hard Chilean currency, you can reduce the chance of your wallet getting stolen by following some advice:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Separate coins and bills. Coins are frequently used when paying for public transport (except in Santiago buses, where you need to board with the Bip card), newspapers or snacks, store them in a small handbag so that your bills will remain concealed."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" 1000-, 2000- and 5000-peso notes should be easily accessible.

Keep in mind that all notes are the same size, but they all are very differently coloured and designed. Chile's Central Bank is in the middle of the process of replacing all notes and its size, so you can find two types of 5000, 10000 and 20000 notes, all of which have legal value and are to be accepted everywhere."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Do not reach for your wallet until the vendor tells you the price."]},"\nChilean Carabineros (National Police) are very trustworthy - call 133 from any phone if you need emergency assistance. Some municipalities (such as Santiago or Las Condes) have private guards; however, they usually don't speak English.\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Do not"]}," try to bribe a carabinero, since it will get you into serious trouble! Unlike other South American police corps, Chilean Carabineros are very proud and honest, and bribery would be a serious offense against their creed.\n\nRegarding driving conditions: Chilean drivers tend to be not as erratic and volatile as those in neighboring countries.\n\nSince Chile is almost racially homogeneous, Chileans get curious and may stare at foreigners. If you are black or Asian, be prepared. There have been reports of racist attacks, but they are infrequent, and the police (carabineros) have become better at handling such situations. If you are from the Middle East, it will be easier to blend in and you will not get the same level of attention. Some chileans might yelle \"negro\" or \"chino\" but only report to the carabineros if being physically assaulted. \n\nDuring the last years more people from the Middle East have migrated to Chile and especially muslims. There are mosques in the country but the average chilean is not used to see women in hijab or burqa. Women dressed with either hijab or burqa might be verbally harassed from younger people and there have been reports of cases where some muslim women or girls have been dragged by the hijab from boys. Even though infrenquent, it can happen in rural places whilst bigger cities may be more tolerant to muslim women. Report to the police if something like that occurs; they can be trusted. There is a sizable Palestinian community but most of them are christians.\n\nLeave your mobile phone at home and buy a cheap one from the local store. If getting robbed, you don't have to be worried about losing an expensive cell-phone, all your contacts, important numbers and messages etc. Buy a cell-phone so you can contact police or medics in any case or for just calling a friend. Wallets, cameras and cell-phone regardless of price and quality are lucrative among petty-thieves for their own use or sale in the black market.\n\nAvoid taking photographs of navy ships and buildings or other military buildings; ask first. If being caught they have the right to arrest you and expect to get all your photos examined and erased. Also expect some questions about why you took a photograph. Chile lives in peace with its neighbours Argentina, Bolivia and Peru but the country is always preparing for an attack which some Chileans think might happen since it's a small and narrow country compared to its bigger neighbour Argentina for example. Some cities like Talcahuano and Punta Arenas are naval cities and be extra careful when taking photographs there. Some marines may speak little English but if not, point at the object you want to take a photo and say \"si?\". If they reply with a \"no\" then it's better to just leave.\n\nSince May 2011 there have been ongoing protests from the Chilean students who demand better and free education. If you happen to be a foreign student, most universities will allow them to enter classes when there is a protest and occupation is taking place. The chances that something will happen at campus is low. But it's a different story once the protest takes place in the streets. Most of them have ended with violence from protesters and police so even if you may sympathize with the students, avoid demonstrations arranged by students of professors.\n\nIf you go out and have a drink in a bar, or clubbing be careful when ordering something. Spiked drinks is not a big problem, the bigger problem is the quality of what you drink. Even though authorities have been trying to ban alcoholic beverages that are poorly made the results are mixed since most places and even supermarkets still sell them. If you see a brand that you recognize from your home country or Chilean brands like Cristal, Kunstmann or Casillero del Diablo (which are produced legally and with quality), then order them instead. Despite perhaps costing you more pesos, it will taste better than the cheaper ones. Be aware of this in places with a lot of students or young people where the cheap drinks, wines or beer can be a potential health risk, especially to a foreigner.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\nHaving relatively good standards in medicine throughout the country, it is not difficult to stay healthy. However, one will usually find more refined resources at a private medical facility.\nIn case of emergency, call 131, but don't expect an operator fluent in English.\n\nHepatitis A vaccine is recommended for all travelers. Other potential vaccines, depending on your travel situation include: Hepatitis B, Typhoid, Rabies, and Influenza.\n\nTap water is safe to drink.
