This added with the harsh winters provided the necessary conditions for a unique culture that includes a wide variety of mystical creatures, that for some reason do not compete with the reigning christian beliefs.\n\nChiloe is famous for myths and legends with roots in its native Mapuche population. The island was Christianized by Spanish conquerors (you can visit 16 World Heritage wooden churches on east cost of the main island and neighbour islands) and Christianity, along European popular beliefs, mixed with Mapuche myths, giving birth to a mythology of sea and forests creatures and warlocks.\nA dancing, fair-haired beauty similar to the German Lorelei is called ",{"type":"'''","value":["Pincoya"]},".
