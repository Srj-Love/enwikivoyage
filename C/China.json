The Zhou adopted a decentralized system of government, in which the feudal lords ruled over their respective territories with a high degree of autonomy, even maintaining their own armies, while at the same time paying tribute to the king and recognising him as the symbolic ruler of China. During the second half of the Zhou period, China descended into centuries of political turmoil, with the feudal lords of numerous small fiefdoms vying for power during the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Spring and Autumn Period"]}," （春秋时代), and later stabilised into seven large states in the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Warring States period"]}," (战国时代).

To this day the majority Chinese race use the term \"Han\" to describe themselves, and Chinese characters continue to be called \"Han characters\" in Chinese, with similar cognates in Japanese and Korean. The Han Dynasty saw the beginning of the Silk Road, and also saw the invention of paper.\n\nThe collapse of the Han Dynasty in AD 220 led to a period of political turmoil and war known as the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Three Kingdoms Period"]}," (三国), which saw China split into the three separate states of Wei (魏), Shu (蜀) and Wu (吴).

The collapse of the Tang Dynasty then saw China divided once again, until it was reunified by the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Song Dynasty"]}," (宋朝) in 960 AD. In 1127, The Song was driven south of the Huai river by the Jurchens, where they continued to rule as the Southern Song based in Lin An (临安Lín'ān) (modern-day Hangzhou), and attained a level of commercial and economic development unmatched until the West's Industrial Revolution. The ",{"type":"'''","value":["Yuan Dynasty"]}," (元朝) (Mongol Empire) first defeated the Jurchens, then proceeded to conquer the Song in 1279, and ruled their vast Eurasian empire from Da Du (modern-day Beijing).\n\nAfter defeating the Mongols, the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ming dynasty"]}," (明朝) (1368-1644) re-instituted rule by ethnic Han.

Famous buildings in Beijing, such as the Forbidden City and the Temple of Heaven, were built in this period. The last dynasty of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Qing (Manchu) dynasty"]}," (清朝) (1644-1911), saw the Chinese empire grow to its current size, incorporating the western regions of Xinjiang and Tibet. The Qing dynasty fell into decay in its final years to become the 'sick man of Asia', where it was nibbled apart by Western powers. The Westerners established their own treaty ports in Guangzhou, Shanghai and Tianjin. China lost several territories to foreign powers; Hong Kong and Weihai were ceded to Britain, Taiwan and Liaodong were to Japan, parts of the North East including Dalian and parts of Outer Manchuria to Russia, while Qingdao was ceded to Germany. In addition, China lost control of its tributaries, with Vietnam being ceded to France, while Korea and the Ryukyu Islands were ceded to Japan.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["The Republic and WWII"]},"\nThe two thousand-year old imperial system collapsed in 1911, when Sun Yat-Sen (孙中山, Sūn Zhōngshān) founded the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Republic of China"]}," (中华民国 Zhōnghuá Mínguó). Central rule collapsed in 1916 after Yuan Shih-kai, the second president of the Republic and self-declared emperor, passed away; China descended into anarchy, with various self-serving warlords ruling over different regions of China. In 1919, student protests in Beijing gave birth to the \"May Fourth Movement\" (五四运动 Wǔ Sì Yùndòng), which espoused various reforms to Chinese society, such as the use of the vernacular in writing, as well as the development of science and democracy.

During the period from 1922 to 1937, Shanghai became a truly cosmopolitan city, as one of the world's busiest ports, and the most prosperous city in East Asia, home to millions of Chinese and 60,000 foreigners from all corners of the globe. However, underlying problems throughout the vast countryside, particularly the more inland parts of the country, such as civil unrest, famines and warlord conflict, still remained.\n\nJapan established a puppet state under the name Manchukuo in Manchuria in 1931, and launched a full-scale invasion of China's heartland in 1937. The Japanese initiated a brutal system of rule in Eastern China, culminating in the Nanjing Massacre of 1937. After fleeing west to Chongqing, the KMT realized the urgency of the situation and signed a tenuous agreement with the CCP to form a second united front against the Japanese. With the defeat of Japan at the end of World War II in 1945, the KMT and CCP armies manoeuvred for positions in north China, setting the stage for the civil war in the years to come. The civil war lasted from 1946 to 1949 and ended with the Kuomintang defeated and sent packing to Taiwan where they hoped to re-establish themselves and recapture the mainland some day.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" A Red China"]},"\nMao Zedong officially declared the establishment of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["People's Republic of China"]}," on 1 Oct 1949.  After an initial period closely hewing to the Soviet model of heavy industrialization and comprehensive central economic planning, China began to experiment with adapting Marxism to a largely agrarian society.\n\nMassive social experiments such as the Hundred Flowers Campaign (百花运动 bǎihuā yùndòng), the Great Leap Forward (大跃进 dàyuèjìn), intended to collectivize and industrialize China quickly, and the Cultural Revolution (无产阶级文化大革命 wúchǎn jiējí wénhuà dà gémìng), aimed at changing everything by discipline, destruction of the \"Four Olds,\" and total dedication to Mao Zedong Thought, rocked China from 1957 to 1976. The Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution are generally considered disastrous failures in China.\n\nMao Zedong died in 1976, and in 1978, Deng Xiaoping became China's paramount leader. Deng and his lieutenants gradually introduced market-oriented reforms and decentralized economic decision making. Economic output quadrupled by 2000 and continues to grow by 8-10% per year, but huge problems remain — bouts of serious inflation, regional income inequality, human rights abuses, ethnic unrest, massive pollution, rural poverty and corruption. The former president and CCP General Secretary, Hu Jintao, had proclaimed a policy for a \"Harmonious Society\" (和谐社会 héxié shèhuì) which promised to restore balanced economic growth and channel investment and prosperity into China's central and western provinces. China continues to develop economically at a breakneck speed, and has overtaken ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Japan"]]}," to become the world's second largest economy after the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United States"]]},", cementing its place once again as a major political, military and economic world power, but what lies ahead for the Middle Kingdom is anybody's guess.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Politics"]},"\nChina is a one-party authoritarian state tightly ruled by the Communist Party of China. China has actually only ever had one open national election, which was back in 1912. The government consists of an executive branch known as the State Council (国务院 Guó Wù Yuàn), as well as a unicameral legislature known as the National People's Congress (全国人民代表大会 Quánguó Rénmín Dàibiǎo Dàhuì). The Head of State is the President (主席 zhǔxí, ",{"type":"''","value":["lit chairman"]},") while the Head of Government is the Premier (总理 zǒnglǐ). Whilst neither of them hold absolute power, the President actually holds the most powerful position with the Premier next to him as the second most powerful person in the country.\n\nChina largely follows a centralized system of government, although the country is administratively divided into 22 provinces, 5 autonomous regions and 4 directly controlled municipalities. The provincial governments are given limited powers in their internal and economic affairs. Autonomous regions are technically given more freedom than regular provinces, for example the right to declare additional official languages besides Mandarin. In addition, there are the Special Administrative Regions (SAR) of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Macau"]]}," that effectively run themselves as separate countries, with only foreign policy and defense being controlled by Beijing, and their political systems are more open and democratic in nature. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Taiwan"]]}," is defined by the PRC as a 'renegade province' awaiting reunification with the mainland. Both the Taiwanese and the PRC governments support eventual reunification in principle and have signed trade pacts to more closely link their economies and lessen the danger of war.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["People and customs"]},"\nChina is a very diverse place with large variations in culture, language, customs and economic levels. The economic landscape is particularly diverse. The major cities such as Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai are modern and comparatively wealthy. However, about 50% of Chinese still live in rural areas even though only 10% of China's land is arable. Hundreds of millions of rural residents still farm with manual labour or draft animals. Some 200 to 300 million former peasants have migrated to townships and cities in search of work. Government estimates for 2005 reported that 90 million people lived on less than USD $924 a year and 26 million were under the official poverty line of USD $668 a year. Generally the southern and eastern coastal regions are more wealthy while inland areas, the far west and north, and the southwest are much less developed.\n\nThe cultural landscape is unsurprisingly very diverse given the sheer size of the country and its population. China has 56 officially recognized ethnic groups; the largest by far is the Han which comprise over 90% of the population. The other 55 groups enjoy affirmative action for university admission and exemption from the one-child policy. The Han, however, are far from homogeneous and speak a wide variety of mutually unintelligible local \"dialects\"; which most linguists actually classify as different languages using more or less the same set of Chinese characters. Many of the minority ethnic groups have their own languages as well. Contrary to popular belief, there is no single unified Han Chinese culture, and while they share certain common elements such as Confucian and Taoist beliefs, the regional variations in culture among the Han ethnic group are actually very diverse. Many customs and deities are specific to individual regions and even villages. Celebrations for the lunar new year and other national festivals vary drastically from region to region. Specific customs related to the celebration of important occasions such as weddings, funerals and births also vary widely. In general contemporary urban Chinese society is rather secular and traditional culture is more of an underlying current in every day life. Among ethnic minorities, the Zhuang, Manchu, Hui and Miao are the largest in size. Other notable ethnic minorities include: Koreans, Tibetans, Mongols, Uighurs, Kirghiz and even Russians. In fact, China is home to the largest Korean population outside Korea, and is also home to more ethnic Mongols than the Republic of Mongolia itself. Many minorities have been assimilated to various degrees with the loss of their language and customs or a fusing with Han traditions. An exception to this trend is the current situation of the Tibetans and Uighurs in China who remain fiercely defensive of their cultures to the point of death.\n\nOn the whole, however, the Chinese love a good laugh and because there are so many ethnic groups and outsiders from other regions, they are used to different ways of doing things and are quite okay with that. Indeed the Chinese often make conversation with strangers by discussing differences in accent or dialect. They are very used to sign language and quick to see a non-verbal joke or pun wherever they can spot one. (A laugh doesn't necessarily mean scorn, just amusement and the Chinese like a \"collective good laugh\" often at times or circumstances that westerners might consider rude.) The Chinese love and adore children, allow them a great deal of freedom and heap attention upon them.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Potentially jarring behaviours"]},"\nForeigners may observe some behaviours in mainland China that may be somewhat jarring.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:China no spitting.jpg"],["thumb"],["120px"],["No spitting please"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Spitting: in the street, shops, supermarkets, hotel lobbies, hallways, restaurants, on buses and even in hospitals.

The further north and west one travels, the drier the climate. Once you leave eastern China and enter the majestic Tibetan highlands or the vast steppes and deserts of Gansu and Xinjiang, distances are vast and the land is very harsh.\n\nBack in the days of the planned economy, the rules stated that buildings in areas north of the Yangtze River got heat in the winter, but anything south of it did not — this meant unheated buildings in places like Shanghai and Nanjing, which routinely see temperatures below freezing in winter. The rule has long since been relaxed, but the effects are still visible. In general, Chinese use less heating and less building insulation, and wear more warm clothing, than Westerners in comparable climates. In schools, apartments and office buildings, even if the rooms are heated, the corridors are not. Double glazing is quite rare. Students and teachers wear winter jackets in class, and long underwear is very common. Air conditioning is increasingly common but is similarly not used in corridors and is often used with the windows and doors open.\n\nThere is a wide range of terrain to be found in China with many inland mountain ranges, high plateaus, and deserts in the centre and the far west.

Taiwan residents may obtain an entry permit (valid for 3 months) at airports in Dalian, Fuhzou, Haikou, Qingdao, Sanya, Shanghai, Wuhan, Xiamen and China Travel Services in Hong Kong and Macau.

Airlines include the three international carriers: Air China, China Southern, and China Eastern, as well as regional ones including Hainan Airlines, Shenzhen Airlines, Sichuan Airlines and Shanghai Airlines.\n\nFlights between Hong Kong or Macau and mainland Chinese cities are considered to be international flights and so can be quite expensive. Hence if arriving in, or departing from, Hong Kong or Macau, it is usually ",{"type":"'''","value":["much"]}," cheaper to fly to or from Shenzhen or Zhuhai, just across the border, or Guangzhou, which is a little further afield but offers flights to more destinations. As an example, the distance from Fuzhou to Hong Kong, Shenzhen or Guangzhou is about the same, but as of mid-2005 flying to Hong Kong cost ¥1,400 while list price for the other cities was ¥880 and for Shenzhen discounts to ¥550 were available. Overnight bus to any of these destinations was about ¥250.\n\nPrices for domestic flights are set at standard rates, but discounts are common, especially on the busier routes. Most good hotels, and many hostels, will have a travel ticket service and may be able to save you 15%-70% off the price of tickets. Travel agencies and booking offices are plentiful in all Chinese cities and offer similar discounts. Even before considering discounts, travelling by aircraft in China is not expensive.\n\nFor travel within China, it is usually best to buy tickets in China, or on Chinese websites (there are several available in English - they will deliver the tickets to hotels in major cities. Payment is made in cash to the person delivering the ticket\/s). Overseas, especially online, vendors often charge much higher rates. Booking too far in advance on Chinese websites is not advisable as prices tend to remain high until 2 months before the flight date, at which point large discounts are usually seen unless a particular flight has been heavily booked far in advance.\n\nBe prepared for unexplained flight delays as these are common despite pressure from both the government and consumers. For short distances, consider other, seemingly slower options. Flight cancellations are also not uncommon. If you buy your ticket from a Chinese vendor they will likely try to contact you (if you left contact information) to let you know about the change in flight plan.

They charge a small commission (e.g. 5 Yuan) but can save you a trip to the train station. In general, if you go to a counter to buy tickets, you will save everyone a lot of hassle if you have your train number, date and time of departure, seating class and number of tickets, as well as origin and destination cities all written down in Chinese, or at least in Pinyin. Staff will not generally speak English, and at the train stations they will not have a lot of patience as there are usually long queues.\n\nTravel agencies will accept money and bookings for tickets in advance but no one can guarantee your ticket until the station releases them onto the market, at which point your agency will go and buy the ticket they had previously \"guaranteed\" you. This is true of anywhere in China.\n\nNationals and foreigners alike ",{"type":"'''","value":["must present ID"]}," in order to purchase a ticket (e.g., national ID card or passport). The purchaser's name is printed onto the ticket and each individual is required to be present, with ID, to pick-up their ticket. Especially around festivals, tickets sell out very quickly, so it is advisable to book tickets as far in advance as possible. One way to get around the ID restriction if one of the passengers is not present is to ask a Chinese person to buy the ticket online. You then only need to input the passport number, presenting the passport when picking up the ticket.\n\nBe aware that many cities have different stations for normal trains and high speed trains. High speed station names usually consist of the city name and the cardinal direction (for example ",{"type":"''","value":["Héngyángdōng"]}," \"Hengyang East\")\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Train stations "]},"\n\nDifferently from what you may be used to, Chinese train stations function similarly to an airport. The most important implication of this is that you should not count on catching a train on the last minute – gates close a few minutes prior to departure! To be safe, be there at least 20 minutes early, or 30 minutes if you are entering a big train station.\n\nYou need to pass an initial ticket and security check to enter the station. Once in the departure hall, follow the digital indicator boards to find the right boarding gate (they should be in both English and Chinese, at least at CRH stations; if Chinese is available only, you will still be able to find the train service number which is printed at the top of your ticket). Wait in the waiting area close to your gate until boarding is announced about 10–20 minutes prior to departure. You will then pass a ticket check (have your passport ready as they may want to see it) and follow the crowd to the platform. Note that there are two types of tickets: red paper tickets which are issued at ticketing agencies, and blue magnetic tickets which you get from the station's ticket office. Blue tickets go into one of the automated ticket gates, while red tickets are checked manually; be sure to go through the gate at the right place.\n\nOn the platform, the train may already be waiting; otherwise, look for your car number written on the platform edge and make sure you're waiting in the right place, because often the train will only stop for a couple of minutes. If there are no such indications, show your ticket to staff and they will show you where to wait. Some newer stations have higher level platforms that are level with the door, but at smaller stations the platforms are very low and you have to ascend several steep steps to board the train, so be prepared if you have a large suitcase. Generally passengers are friendly and will offer to help you with any bulky luggage.\n\nAt your destination, you leave the platform through one of the clearly indicated exits, which will not bring you into the waiting area but outside of the station. Your ticket may be checked again and may or may not be kept.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Travel tips "]},"\n\nCRH trains are top-notch, even internationally, in terms of equipment and cleanliness. This includes the toilets, which reliably have toilet paper and soap available – a rare thing in China. The toilets on non-high-speed trains also tend to be a little more \"usable\" than on buses or most public areas because they are simple devices that empty the contents directly onto the track and thus don't smell as bad. Soft sleeper cars usually have European style toilets at one end of the car and Chinese squat toilets at the other. Be aware that on non-CRH trains if the train will be stopping at a station, the conductor will normally lock the bathrooms prior to arrival so that people will not leave deposits on the ground at the station.\n\nLong distance trains will have a buffet or dining car, which serves not very tasty hot food at around ¥25. The menu will be entirely in Chinese, but if you're willing to take the chance then you can eat very well (try to interpret some of the Chinese characters, or ask for common dishes by name). If you are on a strict budget then wait until the train stops at a station. There are normally vendors on the platform who will sell noodles, snacks, and fruit at better prices. Trains generally have boiled water available so bring tea, soups and instant noodles in order to make your own food.\n\nBe careful with your valuables while on the train; property theft on public transportation has risen in recent years.\n\nOn most higher-level trains (T, K, Z and CRH trains) pre-recorded announcements are made in Chinese, English and occasionally Cantonese (if the train serves Guangdong province or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong"]]},"), Mongolian (in Inner Mongolia), Tibetan (in Tibet) or Uyghur (in Xinjiang). Local trains will have no announcements in English, so knowing when to get off can be harder.\n\nMotion sickness pills are recommended if you are inclined toward that type of ailment. Ear plugs are recommended to facilitate uninterrupted sleep. In sleeper cars, tickets are exchanged for cards on long distance trains. The cabin attendants return the original tickets when the train approaches the destination station thus ensuring everyone gets off where they should even if they can't wake themselves up.\n\nIf you have some things to share on the train, you'll have fun.

However, if you can understand the bus routes then they are cheap and go almost everywhere. Buses will normally have recorded announcements telling you the next stop - examples of which might include 'xia yi zhan - zhong shan lu' (next stop Zhongshan Road) or 'Shanghai nan huo che zhan dao le' (Shanghai South railway station - now arriving). Some major cities such as Beijing or Hangzhou will have English announcements on some major routes. Fares are usually about ¥1-2 (the former for older buses with no air-conditioning, the latter for air-conditioned modern buses) or more if travelling into the suburbs. Most buses simply have a metal cash-box next to the entrance where you can insert your fare (no change - save up those 1 yuan coins) or on longer routes a conductor that will collect fares and issue tickets and change. Note that the driver usually prioritises speed over comfort so hold on tight.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Infobox"],["Sleeper buses"],["Sleeper buses are common in China; instead of seats they have bunk beds.

Try to avoid getting the bunk at the very back of the bus; if the bus hits a major bump, passengers there become airborne.\n\nAt some places you have to remove your shoes as you enter the bus; a plastic bag is provided to store them. Follow the locals. If there are food or restroom stops, you put the shoes back on. If you normally travel in boots, it is worth getting a pair of kung fu slippers to make this easy."]]},"\n\nCoaches, or ",{"type":"'''","value":["long-distance buses"]},", differ drastically and can be a reasonably comfortable or very unpleasant experience. Coaches originating from larger cities on the east coast tend to be air conditioned with soft seats or sleepers. The roads are very good and the ride is smooth, allowing you to enjoy the view or take a snooze. Coaches are often a better, though more expensive option than trains. Bus personnel tend to try to be helpful, but they are much less familiar with foreigners than airline personnel and English ability is very rare. Some coaches have toilets, but they are frequently dirty and using them can be difficult as the bus turns a corner and water in the basin splashes around.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Xiaoxi - Bus no. 2 - DSCF4163.JPG"],["thumb"],["A local rural bus in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pinghe County"]]},", Fujian."]]},"\nA coach or bus in rural China is a different experience altogether. Signs in the station to identify buses will only be in Chinese or another local language, routes may also be posted or pasted on bus windows and drivers or touts will shout their destinations as you pass, the coach's license plate number is supposed to be printed on the ticket, but all too often that is inaccurate. Due to different manners and customs, foreigners may find bus personnel to be lacking in politeness and other passengers lacking in manners as they spit on the floor and out the window and smoke. The vehicle can get crowded if the driver decides to pick up as many passengers as he can cram into the bus. The roads in rural China are frequently little more than a series of potholes, which makes for a bumpy and painful ride; if you have a seat in the back of the bus you'll spend much of your trip flying through the air. Scheduled times of departure and arrival are only rough estimates, as many buses won't leave until every seat is sold, which can add hours, and breakdowns and other mishaps can significantly extend your trip. The misery of your ride is only compounded if you have to travel for 10–20 hours straight. As gut-wrenching as all this sounds, short of shelling out the cash for your own personal transport, rural coaches are the only forms of transportation in many areas of China. On the bright side, such rural coaches are usually more than willing to stop anywhere along the route should you wish to visit more remote areas without direct transport. Buses can also be flagged down at most points along their route. The ticket price the rest of the way is negotiable.\n\nEverywhere in China drivers often disregard the rules of the road, if there are any, and accidents are frequent. Sudden swerves and stops can cause injury, so keep a good hold wherever possible. Horn honking is widespread among Chinese drivers, so a set of earplugs is a good idea if you plan on sleeping during the trip.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Qujiang - highway bus stop - DSCF3093.JPG"],["thumb"],["A highway bus stop in Qujiang, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nanjing County"]]},", Fujian.

Large bus stations have ticket counters who sell printed tickets displaying the departure time, boarding gate and license plate number of your bus (not always accurate) and have fixed prices. Smaller bus stations will have touts shouting destinations and will direct you to your bus where you pay on board. Even large stations have touts outside - generally they will call the bus driver of a departing bus, who will wait up the road while the tout takes you there on the back of a motorcycle to the waiting bus - you can then negotiate the fare with the driver. This is sometimes a complete scam and sometimes you can save around 30% of the fare - depending on your bargaining and Chinese abilities.\n\nThere is an alternative now with an Independent Travel Network that has been created by a western company.  Dragon Bus China now operates an Integrated transport and accommodation network across most of China.   The Network is a “Jump On & Off” style of travel which means that you can stay longer at any of the Cities that they travel through and be assured that another bus will be coming through that same City for you or you travel partners to board.   This travel option has been operating for more than 25 years throughout Europe and is an extremely popular form of independent travel within New Zealand, Australia and Canada. Travelling by this method could greatly reduce the hassle of travelling by public buses and greatly increase the safety aspect.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By subway"]},"\nMajor cities — at least Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Wuhan, Shenyang, Xi'an, Chengdu and Nanjing — have a subway (地铁 ",{"type":"''","value":["dìtiě"]},") system. Chongqing has monorail systems. Xiamen has \"Bus Rapid Transit\": a system of bus-only roads, mostly elevated. Generally these are modern, clean and efficient. The signs and ticket machines are in both English and Chinese.\n\nMost of these systems are being expanded, and new lines are under construction (as of early 2009) in other cities such as Hangzhou, Xi'an and Chengdu. The long-term plans are quite ambitious, with multiple subway lines per city planned. By 2020 or so China seems likely to have some of the world's most extensive urban transport infrastructure. Subway systems which link into regional rail systems such as between Guangzhou and Shenzhen are planned in many regions.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By taxi "]},"\nTaxis (出租车 ",{"type":"''","value":["chūzūchē"]}," or 的士 ",{"type":"''","value":["dishì"]},", pronounced \"deg-see\" in Cantonese-speaking areas) are generally common, and reasonably priced. Flagfalls range from ¥5 in some cities to ¥14 in others, with a per km charge around ¥2-3. In most situations, you can expect between ¥10-50 for an ordinary trip within the city. There is no extra charge for luggage, but in many cities rates are a bit higher at night. (For example, in Shanghai flag fall costs ¥14  06:00-22:59, and ¥18 23:00-05:59) Tips are not expected.\n\nWhile it is not unheard of for drivers to cheat visitors by deliberately selecting a longer route, it is not that common, and usually shouldn't be a nuisance. When it does happen, the fare difference will usually be minimal. However, should you feel you have been seriously cheated on the way to your hotel, and you are staying at a mid- or high-range hotel that has a doorman, you can appeal to him and\/or the desk staff for assistance: A single sharp sentence pointing out the deception may resolve the issue.\n\nAlso beware of taxi hawkers who stalk naive travellers inside or just outside the airport terminals and train stations. They will try to negotiate a set price to bring you to your destination and will usually charge 2x or 3x more than a metered fare. If you’re not familiar with the area then stick with the designated taxi areas that are outside most major airport terminals and insist that the driver use the meter. The fare should be plainly marked outside the taxi.\n\nFinding a taxi during peak hours can be a bit hard. But it really gets tough if it is raining. Away from peak hours, especially at night, it is sometimes possible to get a 10% to 20% discount especially if you negotiate it in advance, even if with the meter on and asking for a receipt. Tipping is not required, although they will certainly not complain if you round up after a long journey.\n\nSitting in the front passenger seat of taxis is acceptable and actually useful if you have trouble communicating in Chinese. Some taxis mount the taxi meter down by the gearbox, where you can only see it from the front seat. Be warned that drivers may start smoking without asking by just opening their window and lighting up. In some cities it is also common for drivers to try and pick up multiple passengers if their destinations are in the same general direction. Each passenger pays full fare but it saves the time of waiting for an empty cab at rush hour.\n\nEven in major cities like Shanghai or Beijing, you are very unlikely to find an English-speaking taxi driver, and anywhere else less so. If you are not able to pronounce ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chinese phrasebook"],["Mandarin"]]}," well then you can be easily misunderstood. Therefore it is advisable to keep a written note of the name of place where you want to go or carry a map. Using romanized spelling (Pinyin) is actually not very helpful since most Chinese can't understand it, so it is always better to get someone to write it down in Chinese characters for you. Business cards for your hotel and for restaurants are useful to show taxi drivers. It will be a good idea to equip yourself with sound tracked guide to conversation in Chinese. Such tools can be easily found on the Internet in different languages.\n\nIf you are in China for any length of time, consider getting a cell phone so you can call Chinese friends and let them tell the driver where to take you. Cellphones are inexpensive, and pay-as-you-go GSM SIM cards are readily available.\n\nIn some cities, taxi companies use a star-rating system for drivers, ranging from 0 to 5, displayed on the driver's name-plate, on the dashboard in front of the passenger seat. While no or few stars do not necessarily indicate a bad driver, many stars tend to indicate good knowledge of the city, and willingness to take you to where you ask by the shortest way. Another indicator of the driver's ability can be found on the same name-plate - the driver's ID number. A small number tells you he has been around for a long time, and is likely to know the city very well. A quick tip to get a taxi driver's attention if you feel you are being ripped off or cheated: Get out the car and start writing down his license plate number and if you speak some Chinese (or have a good phrasebook) threaten to report the driver to the city or the taxi company. Most drivers are honest and fares are not very high but there are the bad ones out there who will try to use your lack of Chinese skills to their advantage.\n\nChinese can sometimes be very assertive when it comes to finding a taxi. The person who flags down a particular car is not necessarily entitled to that ride. Having locals move farther up in traffic to intercept cars or being shoved out of the way while trying to enter a taxi is common. If there are others in the area competing for rides, be ready to reach your car and enter it as soon as possible after flagging it down.\n\nWear your seat belt at all times (if you can find it) however much the taxi driver insists you don't need it.\nSome taxi drivers, in particular those who can speak some English, can be quite curious and talkative, especially during peak hours' traffic (高峰 ",{"type":"''","value":["gāo​fēng"]},"). You'll find a conversation very amusing or pretty annoying depending on the character and the driver's English capabilities, or your knowledge of the Chinese language.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By tram (trolley)"]},"\nAbove ground, certain cities like Dalian or Changchun, offer transport via tram.

Prices vary from as little as ¥150 to over ¥10,000. For a reasonably well-equipped mountain bike for riding to areas like Tibet, expect around ¥3,000-4,500 for a bike. Big cities like Shanghai and Beijing usually stock more upmarket bikes, but if you have very specific requirements, Hong Kong is still the last hope for buying them.\n\nBicycle repair shops are frequent apparently anywhere in cities and rural areas; Non-Chinese speaking tourists might find it a bit difficult, but you can just look for bikes and tires. For a quick fix to a sudden flat tire, there are also many people standing by along the road with a bowl of water and a repair kit ready. For special parts like disc brake, you may want to bring your spare one if you are not using them in big cities.\n\nChina is a vast country and it provides serious cyclists with challenges to bike across mountains and desert.

However, as with many laws in China, official changes and changes in practice do not necessarily correspond; as of December 2008 it is still illegal for foreigners to drive without a Chinese license.

In some cases, 50cc mopeds can be ridden without a driving license although many cities have now banned them or reclassified them due to numerous accidents. Riding a 'proper' motorcycle is much harder - partly because you'll need a Chinese license, partly because they are banned in many cities and partly because production and importing have slowed with the focus on automobiles and electric scooters. The typical Chinese motorcycle is 125cc, can do about 100 km\/h and is a traditional cruiser style. They are gnerally slow, mundane to ride and have little sporting potential. Government restrictions on engine size mean that sports bikes are rare but can still be found. Another popular choice is a 125cc automatic 'maxi' scooter based loosely on the Honda CN250 - it's a bit quicker than a moped and more comfortable over long distances but has the benefit of automatic transmission which makes negotiating stop-start urban traffic much easier.\n\nMost cities will have a motorcycle market of some description and will often sell you a cheap motorcycle often with fake or illegal license plates - although a foreigner on a motorbike is a rare sight and it will grab the police's attention. Helmets are essential on 'proper' bikes but optional on scooters. Technically you'll need a license plate - they are yellow or blue on a motorcycle or green on a scooter and can cost several thousand yuan to register the bike yourself although fake plates are easily available at a lower price - do so at your own risk.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By pedicab (rickshaw)"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["What's in a name?"],["The terms pedicab and rickshaw are often used interchangeably by foreigners in China, but refer to two different modes of transportation - one of which no longer exists.

These proliferated in the late 19th century but were gradually phased out by the 1950s. Videos of Western elites playing polo on rickshaws propelled by Chinese workers showcased the exploitative nature of rickshaws. A distant relative of the rickshaw can still be seen when day-laborers in smaller or less developed cities gather with their rickshaw-like carts each morning waiting for work delivering construction materials, coal, or other odds and ends. The rickshaw has been replaced by the pedicab - a three-wheeled conveyance ridden much like a bicycle."]]},"\n\nIn some mid-sized cities, pedicabs are a much more convenient means of travelling short distances. Sanlunche (三轮车), the Chinese term used both for pedal-powered and motorized rickshaws, are ubiquitous in rural China and lesser developed (which is to say, less touristy) areas of larger cities. Negotiating the fare in advance is a must.\n\nReports that \"the drivers will frequently try and rip you off\" probably refer to rip-off artists working tourist destinations, like Silk Alley, Wangfujing, and the Lao She Tea House in Beijing in particular. Perhaps the rule of thumb should be, \"Beware of anyone selling anything near tourist traps.\"\n\nIf you see normal Chinese families using the \"sanlun\" - for instance, travelling between the Beijing Zoo and the nearest subway stop - then it's safe. Don't patronise any sanlun wearing some old fashioned costume to attract tourists. He'll try to charge you ten times the going rate.\n\nWhere possible try to choose pedicabs over motorized transport.

Mandarin has been the only language used in education on the mainland since the 1950s, and the main language for government and media, so most people speak it. Unless otherwise noted, all terms, spellings and pronunciations in this guide are in standard Mandarin. As Mandarin is tonal, getting the four tones correct is necessary to be understood.\n\nMany regions, especially in the southeast and south of the country, also have their own \"dialect\", but that term has a different meaning for Chinese than for other languages. Chinese dialects are not mutually intelligible; the spoken forms are as different as French and Italian or English and Dutch which are considered separate, though related, languages. However, all Chinese dialects are written (mostly) the same way and calling them \"dialects\" rather than \"languages\" is both common among linguists and politically correct in China. Like standard Mandarin, the \"dialects\" are all tonal languages. Even within Mandarin (the large brown language area on the map), pronunciation varies widely between regions and there is often a liberal dose of local slang or terminology to liven up the mix.\n\nAfter Mandarin, the two largest groups are ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wu phrasebook"],["Wu"]]},", spoken in the region around Shanghai, Zhejiang and southern ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jiangsu"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cantonese phrasebook"],["Cantonese"]]}," (Yue), spoken in most of Guangdong Province, Hong Kong and Macau.

Some who are older, less educated or from the countryside may speak only the local dialect, but this is unlikely to affect tourists. It often helps to have a guide who can speak the local language as it marks that person as an insider and you as a friend of the insider. While you can easily get by in most parts of China speaking Standard Mandarin, locals always appreciate any attempt to say a few words or phrases in the local dialect, so learning a few simple greetings will help you get acquainted with the locals much more easily. In general, an understanding of or appreciation for the local speech can be useful when travelling to more remote areas. But in those areas a phrase book that includes Chinese characters will still be a big help as written Chinese is more or less the same everywhere.\n\nFormal written Chinese is for all intents and purposes the same regardless of the local dialect. Even Japanese and Korean use many of the same characters with the same or similar meaning. There is a complication in this, however. Mainland China uses \"simplified characters\", adopted to facilitate literacy during the mid-1950s. Traditional characters are used in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and by many overseas Chinese, but also on the mainland in advertising and commercial signs. As a result you will just as often see 银行 (",{"type":"''","value":["yínháng"]},") as 銀行 for \"bank\". The simplification was however fairly systematic, which means that all hope is not lost for the traveller trying to pick up some sign-reading skills. On the other hand, native speakers usually do not encounter problems reading either script so learning how to write either one would usually suffice.\n\nNote that in calligraphy, the number of scripts is much more varied as different painters use different unique styles, though these have been grouped into five different styles. They are ",{"type":"''","value":["zhuanshu"]},"(篆书／篆書), ",{"type":"''","value":["lishu"]},"(隶书\/隸書), ",{"type":"''","value":["kaishu"]}," (楷书\/楷書), ",{"type":"''","value":["xingshu"]}," (行书\/行書) and ",{"type":"''","value":["caoshu"]}," (草书\/草書), of which ",{"type":"''","value":["kaishu"]}," is the official script used in China today. When calligraphy is written in ",{"type":"''","value":["kaishu"]},", it is usually traditional Chinese characters that are used due to their superior aesthetic value. The casual traveller can easily get by without learning the other four styles though learning them would certainly help those with a deep interest in traditional Chinese art.\n\nIn the far western reaches of the country, Turkic languages such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Uyghur phrasebook"],["Uighur"]]},", Kirghiz, and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kazakh phrasebook"],["Kazakh"]]}," as well as other languages such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tibetan phrasebook"],["Tibetan"]]}," are spoken by some of the non-Han ethnic minorities. In the north and northeast other minority languages including Manchu, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mongolian phrasebook"],["Mongolian"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Korean phrasebook"],["Korean"]]}," are also spoken in areas populated by the respective ethnic minorities. Yunnan, Guizhou, Hainan and Guangxi in the south are also home to many other ethnic minorities such as the Miao, Dong, Zhuang, Bai and the Naxi who speak their own languages. However, with the possible exception of the elderly, Mandarin is generally usable in these areas too, and most younger people are bilingual in their minority language and Mandarin. Sadly some of the minority languages such as Manchu are dying out.\n\n",{"type":"''","value":["See also"]},": ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chinese phrasebook"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cantonese phrasebook"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wu phrasebook"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Minnan phrasebook"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["English speakers"]},"\nFor the last twenty years, Chinese students have been taught English as a compulsory subject starting from late elementary or middle school. Passing an English exam is a requirement to earn a four-year university degree, regardless of major. However, the focus of the instruction at all levels is formal grammar and, to a lesser degree, writing rather than speaking or listening. While knowledge of very basic words and phrases such as \"Hello,\" \"thank you\", \"OK\" and \"Bye bye\" appears nearly universal, few are able to participate in an English conversation.\n\nEven in the big cities, outside major tourist attractions and establishments catering specifically to foreigners, it is rare to find locals conversant in English. Airline staff and those at large hotels - particularly international chains - usually speak some basic to conversational English, although in-depth skills are seldom seen. Proficiency among university graduates, even those with degrees in English, ranges from nonexistent to fluent.\n\nWhile English signage or menus are increasingly widespread in China, especially at or near tourist attractions, they are often written in grammatically incorrect English with the wrong sentence structure, unusual word choice, or even complete mistranslations of several words. Such signage can be difficult to read but as \"Chinglish\" follows certain rules, it can usually be deciphered. Oftentimes, translations are simply a word-by-word equivalent of a Chinese expression which, like a word puzzle, can sometimes be pieced together with some thought but in other cases may be utterly baffling.\n\nWhen speaking, as anywhere English language skills are limited, it is helpful to simplify your English. Speak slowly, avoid slang and idioms, and use simple present tense declarative sentence structure.  Don't say \"Would you mind if I come back tomorrow?\", stick to simpler, more abrupt phrasing like \"Tomorrow I will return.\" This brings the phrase closer to its Chinese equivalent and is therefore not necessarily condescending.\n\nOne way to meet people is to ask about \"English Corner\" - a time and place in town where local residents, often with a foreign host or speaker, meet to practice spoken English. Typically, they are held on Friday evenings or Sundays in public parks, English training schools, bookstores, and university campuses. There may also be \"Corners\" for French, German, Russian and perhaps other languages.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Other Languages"]},"\n\nAlthough not as widespread as English, there are some foreign languages that are of use in China.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Korean_phrasebook"],["Korean"]]}," is spoken as a native language by the ethnic Korean minority in the north east of the country. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Japanese phrasebook"],["Japanese"]]}," is spoken by some professionals in international businesses. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["German"]]}," is a popular language for engineering professionals. People in border areas and some older people are sometimes able to speak ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russian phrasebook"],["Russian"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Learning Chinese"]},"\n",{"type":"''","value":["See also:"]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Learn"],["Learn"]]},"\n\nIn the West, Chinese has a reputation for difficulty.  The language is more dense than European languages, meaning considerably more can be said in a text message with the same number of characters.  Each character corresponds to a syllable, and each syllable can have multiple meanings depending on the tone with which it is pronounced.  The grammar, however, may strike a westerner as pretty simple. Verbs are static regardless of subject and whether they are referring to the past, present or future. Genders of nouns do not exist, and there is no separate form of nouns for plurals. The main difficulties are the existence of several consonants not present in European languages and use of the four tones.\n\nMandarin, like Vietnamese and Thai, is a tonal language that uses a pitch in sounds to inflict different meanings. \"Ma\" could mean mother, horse, numb, or blame, depending on the tone. Homophones are also common; the same sound at the same pitch usually has dozens of meanings. \"Zhong1\" (\"Zhong\" at the 1st tone) can mean China, loyalty, clock, chime, finish, a bowl, etc. All of them come with different Chinese characters, just the same sound at the same pitch. While homophones are unlikely a problem in most everyday conversations, it is very common for Chinese to ask how to write someone's name by identifying the characters one by one. \"My name is Wang Fei (王菲). Wang is the \"wang\" with four strokes, Fei is the \"fei\" in \"shifei\"(gossip), with a grass on top.\"\n\nWritten Chinese looks like a mysterious secret code to some, but if you can recognize so many commercial logos—usually not logically related, you will be impressed with your capacity to memorize so many characters - most of them are logically related and formed based on certain rules.\n\nThere are, in theory, more than 50,000 Chinese characters. The good news is that more than 85% have become obsolete, or are rarely used. Like native speakers of many languages, most Chinese couldn't tell you how many characters are required to read a book and never bother to count how many characters they know. One may argue that junior students are supposed to learn at least 2000 characters and graduates in university 5000 characters.\n\nTo bridge the gap between recognizing and reading out loud, pinyin was developed, which uses Latin script as an aid to teaching Chinese. Pronouncing pinyin is not intuitive as certain letters and consonant clusters are used to represent sounds not present in European languages and are thus not pronounced as a westerner would expect. Nonetheless, learning pinyin at even a basic level has enormous practical value for the traveller. Written pinyin is less useful as most Chinese will not recognize place names or addresses in pinyin; it is always better to use characters for written information.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Interpreters"]},"\nForeign travelers in China may benefit from having an interpreter supporting them. Taxi drivers and many other people do not speak English. Prices and quality vary substantially, but some Western-managed organizations and marketplaces exist that specialize in translation and interpretation for English-speaking customers. These exist as both websites (e.g. ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.seekpanda.com SeekPanda"]},") and smartphone apps (e.g. ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.trip-per.com Tripper"]},").\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nChina's attractions are endless and you will never run out of things to see. Especially near the coastal areas, if you run out of things to see in one city, the next one is usually just a short train ride away.\n\nWhether you are a history buff, a nature lover or someone who just wants to relax on a nice beach, China has it all from the majestic Forbidden City in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beijing"]]},", to the breathtaking scenery of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jiuzhaigou"]]},".

The main focus is on the texture of different parts, metal line, change of colours under different lights. Everyone has their own method, so just ask.\n\nIt is very common for cashiers to scrutinize banknotes and the more expensive supermarkets even have machines that can spot counterfeits. This is standard practice in China and offence should not be taken. Likewise, you should also carefully examine notes given back to you as sales people may sometimes try to give you counterfeit money in change.\n\nCounterfeits from ATMs became are not common however, many people are still concerned. If you are worried, withdraw your money from the bank counter and say \"I worry about jiabi (",{"type":"''","value":["counterfeit"]},")\". You will find that bank staff are very understanding about this.\n\nIt's not unheard of for unscrupulous money exchangers on the Chinese border areas to give counterfeits to travellers. You are highly advised to go to a bank if you're not experienced in checking notes. \n\nWhen you pay with a ¥50 or ¥100 banknote in a shop or taxi, it's socially accepted that you note down the last few digits of the banknote you are handing over. This is in case they claim your banknote is fake, then these remembered digits will ensure they give you the exact same note back.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Currency exchange"]},"\nAlthough still restricted, the yuan is readily convertible in many countries, especially in Asia. The Hong Kong dollar, US dollar, Canadian dollar, Euro, pound sterling, Australian dollar, Japanese yen and South Korean won can be easily changed in China. Southeast Asian currencies are generally not accepted, the exception being Singapore dollars. Currency should only be changed at major banks (Bank of China in particular) or with the licensed money changers usually found at airports or high end hotels although these offer very bad rates.\n\nA black market for currency exchange does exist but you are highly advised to avoid as ",{"type":"'''","value":["counterfeiting"]}," is a major issue when exchanging money in China.

Private money changers, widely seen in many tourist spots or shopping malls around the globe, are still uncommon in China. In a bank, it usually takes 5 minutes to 60 minutes to process the exchange, sometimes a little faster in an hotel, depending on their experience. Generally speaking bank branches in major cities know the procedure and are relatively quick while even main branches in third and fourth tier cities can take much longer.\n\nRegardless of location, you will need to fill a form and show your passport. Your passport will be photocopied and scanned. Keep the exchange receipt if you plan to leave the country with larger sum of money. Note that not all banks with the \"Exchange\" logo will exchange money for non-customers or for all currencies in cash. For example, Standard Chartered will only exchange cash for its customers and will only do USD and HKD in cash (but opening an account is quick and doable even on a tourist visa, and they offer a better cash exchange rate than most local banks).\n\nExchanging US currency for RMB can be simple, but expect the bills to be heavily scrutinized before the exchange is processed. Opportunities to buy RMB before entering China, for example when coming overland from Hong Kong or Vietnam, should be taken, as the rates are better. The same is true going the other way - selling just across the border will often net a more favorable rate. Also, most international banks will allow you to get a cash advance via a debit or credit card at a Chinese ATM. However, the rates for such actions are often unfavorable and may include steep service charges. It's useful to carry an international currency such as pounds sterling, US dollars, or Japanese Yen to fall back on should you not have access to a cash machine.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Banking"]},"\nObtaining a Chinese bank account is a very good idea for long-term travel or residence. For Chinese owned banks you will only need your passport with a valid visa, and even tourist visas are sometimes acceptable. Some banks such as Bank of East Asia will require proof of residence and some may also require an initial deposit of around ¥100. Bank staff are typically unable to speak English, though some branches of the larger banks in the centres of major cities may have English-speaking staff available.\n\nYou may receive a bank book in which all transactions and balances are recorded, although most large banks will provide card only accounts. Depending on the bank, a PIN and\/or ID may be required for withdrawals at the counter.\n\nChina currently imposes certain restrictions on the international transfer of Chinese Yuan out of the country. The rules change frequently, although for the most part it places a limit on the amount you may transfer daily. \n\nBanks usually charge a fee (around 1%) for depositing and withdrawing money in a different city than the one you opened your account in  ATMs are now present in almost all towns and cities except in the most remote areas.

In big cities like Shanghai most ATMs will take Visa\/Plus\/MC\/Maestro\/Cirrus. However, cash advances from Diner's Club, American Express, or JCB cards are more difficult. For visitors from Hong Kong or Macau, the only ATMs that natively take JETCO cards are Bank of East Asia ATMs. Most ATMs will charge a small and flat fee.\n\nNote: Minsheng Bank, Shenzhen Development Bank, and Bank of Shanghai ATMs will sometimes display PLUS\/Cirrus\/Maestro logos. In reality, only selected ATMs of theirs are linked into these networks, and there is usually no indication until you try. This is true of many other banks' ATMs, even Agricultural Bank of China (one of the big four).\n\nBefore travelling, find out if your home bank charges a currency conversion fee (often between 0-3%) on such transactions. It is worth opening a zero conversion fee account beforehand if possible. Otherwise it would be better to open a local account on arrival to store money in if staying for a sufficiently long time.\n\nIf you have trouble because the ATM requires a 6-digit PIN and your PIN only has 4 digits, try adding 2 zeros before it. If you find yourself in a town with a Bank of China branch but no international network-capable ATM, it is usually possible to get a cash advance on a credit card inside the bank. Just ask.\n\nUnionPay, the local ATM card network, has made agreements with various ATM card networks across the globe. If your card is covered, any ATM in China will accept withdrawals and balance inquiries from your card. Currently covered are NYCE and Pulse in America (also applies to cash advances from Discover cards), Interac in Canada, and LINK in the UK.\n\nAlso, if your bank is part of the Global ATM Alliance, be aware that China Construction Bank is the local partner for fee-free withdrawals.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Electronic transfers"]},"\nElectronic money transfers to another country are no longer as difficult as they used to be. Just about every bank in the big cities offers this service nowadays. On the other hand, service charges are variable (depends on the sending and receiving bank), the staff is sometimes ill-trained, and the process can take up to a week to clear. Alternatively, you may choose to look for a Chinese branch of a foreign or Hong Kong-based bank to do transfers. This is easier in the big cities, though.\n\nIt will be ",{"type":"'''","value":["much"]}," easier to do transfers if you have an dual-currency account with the Bank of China - opened at the branch from which you plan to get your money. Electronic transfers to dual currency accounts incur no or very low fees although it will usually take about one week. Transfers to Chinese accounts from overseas also take from three to ten business days. All you need to start an account is your passport, visa and a small initial deposit (can be RMB) plus the new-account fee (¥10-20). If you open a foreign currency account or a dual currency account, be sure to check if you will be able to access it in another province or overseas. Alternatively, for visitors from the US, Wells Fargo offers a service called ExpressSend that allows someone to send money from the US and have it arrive at a China Agricultural Bank account on the same day.\n\nWestern Union has deals with China Agricultural Bank and with China Post so there are a lot of Western Union signs around. This is what overseas Chinese sending money to relatives, or expats sending money out of China, generally use; it is generally easier and cheaper than the banks. A list of locations is available through Western Union's website. There may, however, be problems. Their system may be down or the employee you deal with may ask for silly things — for an overseas transfer, the recipient's passport and visa numbers, or for a within-China transfer, cash in US dollars. Just try another branch if you are having difficulties.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Credit cards"]},"\nOutside of star-rated or chain hotels, major supermarkets, and high-class restaurants, credit cards are generally not accepted and most transactions will require cash. Many department stores and large grocery stores have point-of-sale terminals for Chinese bank cards, but these will not work for most foreign cards.\n\nMost Chinese banks and many merchants use the UnionPay system, so a foreign card that supports UnionPay — Discover or JCB (Japan Credit Bureau) — will be widely accepted. Visa, MasterCard or American Express are less common. Most convenience stores take UnionPay, as do most restaurant chains, stores selling high-value items, grocery store chains, and most ATMs. \n\nIf you are going to spend a lot of time in China and use significant amounts of money, consider getting a Chinese bank account or signing up for an international card that can interact with UnionPay. Ideally, if in a big city and later travelling to smaller ones, try signing up for an account with smaller banks like Woori Bank or Ping An Bank; these offer free inter-bank ATM withdrawals anywhere in China (Ping An Bank also offers free withdrawals overseas, a plus if travelling to nearby countries). Alternatively, Travelex offers UnionPay Cash Passports in certain countries.\n\nIf you have a bank account in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong"]]}," then you may be able to open an additional Renminbi account with a UnionPay card which is very convenient for travelling in the mainland.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Costs"]},"\nWhile China is no longer the bargain destination it was during the 1990s, it remains quite affordable.

If you eat local food, use public transportation and stay in very inexpensive budget hotels or hostels then ¥200-300 is a serviceable daily backpacker budget. However, if you want to live an extravagant lifestyle and eat only Western food and stay in star-rated hotels, then even ¥3,000 a day would not be enough.\n\nThere is a high degree of variation in prices depending on where you go. Major cities like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beijing"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guangzhou"]]}," generally cost more than second tier cities and rural, inland parts of the country.

Nonetheless, many Hong Kong or Macau residents (who live just across the border from Shenzhen and Zhuhai, respectively), and who are generally more affluent than mainlanders, often go to these cities to shop, play golf, and enjoy services like massage as prices are far lower.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Tipping"]},"\nAs a general rule, tipping is not practiced anywhere in China.  When leaving a tip on your table, it is common to see a waiter chase after you to return the money you \"forgot\" to take.\n\nIn a hotel, it is widely accepted not to tip for room service, airport service, taxis or anything else. Masseurs in some areas such as Shenzhen have been known to ask for a tip. However, if they become pushy at getting tips most Chinese see this as extortion and an immoral practice, so just be firm if you don't wish to give any.\n\nIn China, compliments over service is usually expressed in implicit ways. If you are a smoker, you are expected to pass a cigarette to the service staff or manager. If you don't do so, you will be seen as selfish and egocentric.

If you want to take any ivory items home, there will be paperwork — at an absolute minimum, you will need a letter from a reputable dealer stating the date of origin. Check with your own country's customs department for other requirements. Also remember that China restricts export of anything older than 1911 (see infobox), and that many of the \"ivory\" items in China are fakes made from various synthetics or ground bone.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Bargaining"]},"\n",{"type":"''","value":["See also"]},": ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bargaining"]]},"\n\nBargaining is a national pastime in China. You can bargain over almost anything, and sometimes it's even possible to ask for discount in a restaurant at the last minute before you pay the bill. Many restaurants or bars will willingly offer a free dish or two (such as a fruit plate in a KTV) if you have made a particularly large order. Shopping malls are less willing to bargain, but why not ask \"Will I get a gift?\"\n\nUnlike many southeast Asian countries, the tourism industry in China is overwhelmingly dominated by Chinese businesses, not westerners running businesses for their own such as seen in places like Bangkok's ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Khao San Road"]]}," or Saigon's Pham Ngu Lao. Merchants in touristy areas, particularly street and sidewalk-stall sellers, are masters in exploiting the wallets of foreigners. They can also be very pushy, sometimes even grabbing your hands. Prices are almost always posted, but they are all substantially marked up, normally 2-3 times. Some items like silk fans (largest size: 1'2\") are posted as ¥60-75, but the lowest price is actually just ¥10. Therefore it's often better to buy souvenirs somewhere just a few blocks away from the tourist spots. Local Chinese tourists have no issue with posted prices because they are all well trained in the art of bargaining. Foreigners always pay more for everything negotiable in China but remember that Chinese whose accents identify them as being from other provinces also pay higher prices than locals. However, if you have sufficient proof that the businessman asks different people for different prices, you can dial 12315 to protect your own right. It is not allowed to label different prices on one item in one business, though posting a high price and expecting some customers to bargain it down is quite legal.\n\nThe purchasing power of the nouveau riche in China makes the place not always cheap anymore. When you go to tourist spots, it is possible to see a ¥1,000 skirt tailor made by a designer, ¥2,000 per a bag of tea, or dozens of thousands for silverware.\n\nIt is hard to tell what price to offer when starting negotiations. Depending on the city, product or market in question, 5% to 50% of the posted price or vendor's first offer is common. Do note that if someone offers you too-great-to-be-true discount, it could be a sign that the goods are of less than great quality. The rule of thumb is to walk around and compare. In tourist spots, it's common to ask for a 30-50% discount, but in a place catering to local people, asking for a 50% discount will only make a fool of yourself.\n\nIn tourist places, don't take what merchants say seriously. When you ask for a 50% discount, they may be appalled and show scorn; it's a favorite drama. Souvenirs, including \"antiques\", are almost all standard products from factories. Compare more. Do be aware that in tourist markets, the room for negotiation is not as wide as it used to be. With so many tourists all shopping for the same products, vendors know they can make high margins and may not be as amenable to negotiating. If your starting price is too low, they may dismiss you because trying to get the margin they want isn't worth their time.\n\nSouvenirs in some places may have no connection with the history of the place, and change frequently, often appearing to be cheap nicknacks the stallholders association picked up cheap and in bulk from a disposal sale. An example is CiQiKou Ancient Porcelain Village in Shapingba district in Chongqing, on one visit the souvenir stalls had large displays of green Irish shamrock medallions in stock, on a return visit some months later they were all gone, replaced by Mexican trinkets.\n\nIn this former communist country, most local people still expect a standard price for grocery products and see it as 'black-hearted' (黑心 hēixīn) to charge too much, even if the shops are in a major business district. However, in a tourist place where rental payments are skyrocketing, if someone sells you a bottle of Coca Cola for ¥5 (usually ¥3 in most places), you may have a chance to bargain a little bit too. It sometimes works, but not all the time.\n\nSouvenir shops for jewellery, herbs, and tea recommended by hotel staff can also be tricky. While it is common that the staff takes tourists to places that give them commission, it is also common that they take you to certain places because the establishment actually offers decent products and prices. If you make a show of being overly cautious, it is likely to offend your hosts because you are suggesting a 'good guy' is actually a cheater.\n\nIn several places like the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lijiang"]]}," Ancient City, when the ethnic horse carriage drivers stop by a souvenir shop, assume that you're paying commission. These carriage operators are notoriously known for extorting money from shops, or creating trouble if the shops refuse to pay. The local government usually avoids intervening in these cases where minority ethnic groups are involved.\n\nMany group tours include mandatory visits to Chinese medicine hospitals such as the National Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, silk, tea, or jade factories or similar shops. The goods are often expensive and include a commission for the tour guide or group. Use your judgment if you want to buy anything. However, the shops visited on tours can offer competitive prices and safe, reliable, international shipping for goods like silk and jade.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Western goods"]},"\nAreas with large expatriate communities like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beijing"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guangzhou"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shenzhen"]]}," have specialty grocery stores catering to those communities. These are often no larger than a 7-Eleven. They usually stock imported snacks, alcohol, and specialty groceries such as meats and cheeses and are often very expensive. See individual articles for details.\n\nSeveral Western-owned supermarket chains are widespread in China — American Wal-mart (沃尔玛 Wòěrmǎ), German Metro (麦德龙 Màidélóng), and French Carrefour (家乐福 Jiālèfú). All have some Western groceries - often at high prices. However, the availability of foreign products diminishes at their branches in second or third-tier cities. Metro is probably the best of these; in particular it usually has a fine selection of alcohol. Asian-owned chains include Japanese Jusco (佳世客 Jiāshìkè), Taiwanese RT-Mart (大潤發 Dàrùnfā), South Korean LOTTE Mart (乐天玛特 Letianmate) and Filipino SM; these also carry imported goods. Some larger Chinese chains such as Beijing Hualian (北京华联 Běijīng Huálián) also carry a limited selection of foreign products.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Tobacco products"]},"\nWhile smoking is decreasing in China, it is still quite common and cigarettes (香烟 xiāngyān) are generally cheap. Cigarettes can be purchased from small neighbourhood stores, convenience stores, counters located in supermarkets and in department stores.\n\nMost mainstream Chinese brands sell at around ¥5-20 for a 20-pack. Popular national brands include Zhongnanhai (中南海 zhōngnánhǎi), Honghe (红河 hónghé), Baisha, Nanjing, Liqun, and Double Happiness (双喜 shuāngxǐ). Some local brands sold in certain regions can be much cheaper whilst others are more expensive. Chinese cigarettes are stronger than many foreign cigarettes (13 mg tar is the norm) although Zhongnanhai is popular with foreign visitors, having a similar taste to Marlboro Light but only half the price. Western brands are available including Marlboro (万宝路 wànbǎolù), 555 (三五 sān wǔ), Davidoff (大卫杜夫 dàwèidùfú), Kent, Salem and Parliament. Western cigarettes are a little more expensive - stick to major convenience store chains such as C-Store or Kedi as many smaller stores sell counterfeit or illegally imported cigarettes.\n\nPremium-brand cigarettes are often ridiculously overpriced and are vary rarely smoked personally - they are usually offered as gifts or bribes as an expression of wealth. The two most famous 'premium brands' include Zhonghua (中华 zhōnghuá) (¥60-100) and Panda (¥100). If you choose to buy them then stick to major department stores - those sold in neighbourhood cigarette stores are likely to be fake. Rolling tobacco and papers are rare in urban China. Lighters (打火机 dǎhuǒjī) are usually cheap (about ¥1) but flimsily made. Zippos are widely available but expensive.\n\nCigars can be bought from some specialist tobacco stores and Chinese-made cigars are surprisingly good - expect to pay around ¥20-30 for 10 locally produced cigars. Beware of fake western-brand cigars sold in bar-districts; they are usually terrible and ridiculously overpriced. Genuine Cuban cigars are available in cigar bars and upscale establishments in large cities but are often very expensive.\n\nDuty-free stores in international airports, international rail stations (e.g. Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou East) and at land borders sell a greater range of imported brands - expect to pay between ¥80-150 for a 200-cigarette carton.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Yangzhou - fish dish - P1070031.JPG"],["thumb"],["A fish dish in a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yangzhou"]]}," restaurant"]]},"\nFood in China varies widely from region to region so the term \"Chinese food\" is pretty much a blanket term, just like \"Western food.\" While visiting, relax your inhibitions and try a bit of everything.\n\nDo keep in mind that undercooked food or poor hygiene can cause bacterial or parasitic infection, particularly during warm or hot weather.  Thus it is advisable to take great care about (and perhaps abstain from) eating seafood and meat on the street during the summer. In addition, unless you're in Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai or other large cities, raw meat and seafood should be avoided. That all being said, the hygiene conditions of a restaurant are usually satisfactory which means that diarrhea is usually not a risk to most people.\n\nChinese gourmands place emphasis on freshness so your meal will most likely be cooked as soon as you order it. Searing hot woks over coal or gas fires make even street food usually safe to eat. Indeed freshly prepared street food, as noted by many travel writers, is often safer than food sitting on the buffet lines of 5-star hotels. China is no exception.\n\nThe two-menu system where different menus are presented according to the skin color of a guest remains largely unheard of in China. Most restaurants only have one menu - the Chinese one. Learning some Chinese characters such as beef (牛), pork (猪), chicken (鸡), fish (鱼), stir-fried (炒), deep-fried (炸), braised (烧), baked or grilled (烤), soup (汤), rice (饭), or noodles (面) will take you a long way.

However, it is ",{"type":"''","value":["very unlikely"]}," that you will order these dishes by a mistake. Dog and snake are usually served in specialty restaurants which do not hide their ingredients.

Men are expected to treat women, elders to juniors, rich to poor, hosts to guests, working class to non-income class (students). Friends of the same class will usually prefer to split the opportunity to pay, rather than split the bill, i.e. \"This is my turn, and you treat next time.\"\n\nIt is common to see Chinese competing intensely to pay the bill. You are expected to fight back and say \"It's my turn, you treat me next time.\" The smiling loser will accuse the winner of being too courteous. All these dramas, despite still being common among all generations and usually played wholeheartedly are becoming somewhat less widely practiced among younger, urban Chinese.\n\nUnless you only hang out with non-Chinese tourists, you will have fair chances of being treated. For budget travellers, the good news is that Chinese tend to be eager to treat foreigners, although you shouldn't expect much from students and grassroots working-class families and individuals.\n\nThat being said, Chinese tend to be very tolerant towards foreigners.

If they try to argue, it usually means that they insist on paying for your bill as well, not the opposite.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Eating at a restaurant"]},"\n\nChinese restaurants often offer an overwhelming variety of dishes. Fortunately, all but the cheapest restaurants have picture menus with photos of each dish, so you are saved from despair facing a sea of characters. Starting from mid-range restaurants, there is also likely to be a more or less helpful English menu. Even with the pictures, the sheer amount of dishes can be overwhelming and their nature difficult to make out, so it is often useful to ask the waiter to recommend (推荐 tuijian) something. They will often do so on their own if they find you searching for a few minutes. The waiter will usually keep standing next to your table while you peruse the menu, so do not be unnerved by that.\n\nDishes ordered in a restaurant are meant for sharing amongst the whole party. If one person is treating the rest, they usually take the initiative and order for everyone. In other cases, everyone in the party may recommend a dish. If you are with Chinese people, it is fine to let them choose, but also fine to let them know your preferences.\n\nIf you are picking the dishes, the first question to consider is whether you want rice. Usually you do, because it helps to keep your bill manageable. However, real luxury lies in omitting the rice, and it can also be nice when you want to sample a lot of the dishes. Rice must usually be ordered separately and won’t be served if you don’t order it. It is not free but very cheap, just a few yuan a bowl.\n\nFor the dishes, if you are eating rice, the rule of thumb is to order at least as many dishes as there are people. Serving sizes differ from restaurant to restaurant. You can never go wrong with an extra plate of green vegetables; after that, use your judgment, look what other people are getting, or ask the waiter how big the servings are. If you are not eating rice, add dishes accordingly. If you are unsure, you can ask the waiter if they think you ordered enough (你觉得够吗? ni juede gou ma?).\n\nYou order dishes simply by pointing at them in the menu, saying “this one” (这个 zhe ge). The way to order rice is to say how many bowls of rice you want (usually one per person): X碗米饭 (X wan mifan), where X is yi, liang, san, si, etc. The waiter will repeat your order for your confirmation.\n\nIf you want to leave, call the waiter by shouting 服务员 (fuwuyuan), and ask for the bill (买单 maidan).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Eating alone"]},"\n\nTraditional Chinese dining is made for groups, with lots of shared dishes on the table. This can make for a lonely experience and some restaurants might not know how to serve a single customer. It might however provide the right motivation to find other people (locals or fellow travellers) to eat with! But if you find yourself hungry and on your own, here are some tips:\n\nChinese-style fast food chains provide a good option for the lone traveller to get filled, and still eat Chinese style instead of western burgers. Another upside is that food safety is generally not an issue. They usually have picture menus or picture displays above the counter, and offer set deals (套餐 taocan) that are designed for eating alone. Usually, you receive a number, which is called out (in Chinese!) when your dish is ready. Just wait at the area where the food is handed out – there will be a receipt or something on your tray stating your number. The price you pay for this convenience is that ingredients are not particularly fresh. It’s impossible to enumerate all of the chains (though look above for some examples), and there is some regional variation, but you will generally recognize a store by a colourful, branded signboard. If you can’t find any, look around major train stations or in shopping areas. Department stores and shopping malls also generally house chain restaurants.\n\nA tastier and cheaper way of eating on your own is street food, but exercise some caution regarding hygiene and be aware that the quality of the ingredients (especially meat) may be suspect. Ask around and check the local wiki page to find out where to get street food in your city; often, there are ",{"type":"''","value":["snack streets"]}," or night markets full of stalls. Another food that can be consumed solo are noodle soups such as beef noodles (牛肉面 niuroumian), a dish that is ubiquitous in China and can also be found at many chain stores.\n\nBear in mind that even if it may be unusual to eat at a restaurant alone, you will not be thrown out and the staff will certainly try to suggest something for you.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nThe Chinese love a tipple and the all-purpose word ",{"type":"''","value":["jiǔ"]}," (酒) covers quite a range of alcoholic drinks.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Toasting"]},"\n\nChinese toast with the word ",{"type":"'''","value":["gānbēi"]}," (干杯, literally \"dry glass\").

Most places outside of major cities serve beer at room temperature, regardless of season, though places that cater to tourists or expatriates have it cold.\n\nThe most famous brand is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Tsingtao"]}," (青島) from Qingdao, which was at one point a German concession. Other brands abound and are generally light beers in a pilsner or lager style with 3-4% alcohol. This is comparable to many American beers, but weaker than the 5-6% beers found almost everywhere else. In addition to national brands, most cities will have one or more cheap local beers. Some companies (Tsingtao, Yanjing) also make a dark beer (黑啤酒 ",{"type":"''","value":["hēipíjiǔ"]},"). In some regions, beers from other parts of Asia are fairly common and tend to be popular with travellers — Filipino ",{"type":"''","value":["San Miguel"]}," in Guangdong, Singaporean ",{"type":"''","value":["Tiger"]}," in Hainan, and Laotian ",{"type":"''","value":["Beer Lao"]}," in Yunnan.\n\nLocally made ",{"type":"'''","value":["grape wine"]}," (葡萄酒 ",{"type":"''","value":["pútaojiǔ"]},") is common and much of it is reasonably priced, from ¥15 in a grocery store, about ¥100-150 in a fancy bar.

The Chinese like their wines red and very, very sweet, and they're typically served over ice or mixed with Sprite.\n\nGreat Wall and Dynasty are large brands with a number of wines at various prices; their cheaper (under ¥40) offerings generally do not impress Western wine drinkers. Chang Yu is another large brand; some of their low end wines are a bit better.

All are drinkable.\n\nThe Chinese are also great fans of various supposedly ",{"type":"'''","value":["medicinal liquors"]},", which usually contain exotic herbs and\/or animal parts. Some of these have prices in the normal range and include ingredients like ginseng. These can be palatable enough, if tending toward sweetness. Others, with unusual ingredients (snakes, turtles, bees, etc.) and steep price tags, are probably best left to those that enjoy them.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Bars, discos and karaoke"]},"\n\nWestern style pubs are becoming increasingly popular across the country. Especially in the more affluent urban centres such as Shenzhen, Shanghai, and Hangzhou one can find painstakingly recreated replicas of traditional Irish or English pubs. Like their Western counterparts most will have a selection of foreign beers on tap as well as provide pub food (of varying quality) and often feature live cover bands. Most of these pubs cater to and are frequented by the expatriate communities so you should not expect to find many Chinese in these places. Be aware that imported beer can be very expensive compared to local brew.\n\nTo just go out for a few drinks with friends, pick a local restaurant and drink beer at around ¥5 for a 600 ml bottle. It will be Chinese lager, around 3% alcohol, with a limited choice of brand and may be served warm. Most mid- to high- range restaurants will have small private suites for gatherings (usually offered free if there is more than around 5 people), and the staff will generally not try to hustle you out even if you decide to stay until closing time. Many residents frequent outdoor restaurants or roadside stalls and barbecues (shāokǎo - 烧烤) for a nice and inexpensive evening.\n\nIn ",{"type":"'''","value":["discos"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["fancy bars"]}," with entertainment, you normally buy beer ¥100 at a time; this gets you anywhere from 4 import-brand beer (Heineken, Bud, Corona, Sol, ..) to 10 local beers. A few places offer cocktails; fewer have good ones.\n\nOther drinks are sold only by the bottle, not by the glass. Red wine is in the ¥80-200 range (served with ice and Sprite) and mediocre imported whiskeys (Chivas, Johnny Walker, Jim Beam, Jack Daniels; extremely rarely single malts) and cognacs, ¥300-800. Both are often mixed with sweet bottled green or red tea. Vodka, tequila and rum are less common, but sometimes available. Bogus \"brand name\" products are fairly common and may ruin your next day.\n\nThese places often have ",{"type":"'''","value":["bar girls"]},", young women who drink a lot and want to play drinking games to get you to consume more. They get a commission on whatever you buy. In general, these girls will not leave the bar with you; they are professional flirts, not prostitutes.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Wuhan-LuoyuDongLu-karaoke-4108.jpg"],["thumb"],["A karaoke place near the Huazhong University of Science and Technology campus in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wuhan"]]}]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Karaoke"]}," (卡拉OK) is huge in China and can be broadly split into two categories. More common is the no-frills karaoke box or ",{"type":"'''","value":["KTV"]},", where you rent a room, bring your friends and the house gives you a mike and sells you booze. Much favored by students, these are cheap and fun with the right crowd, although you need at least a few people for a memorable night. Bringing your own booze can keep the price tag down but must be done on the sly - many places have windows in the door so the staff can make sure you only drink liquor they sold to you.\n\nRather different is the distinctly dodgier ",{"type":"'''","value":["special KTV"]}," lounge, more oriented to businessmen entertaining clients or letting their hair down, where the house provides anything and everything at a price. At these often opulent establishments — over-the-top Roman and Egyptian themes are standard — you'll be joined by short-skirted professional karaoke girls, who charge by the hour for the pleasure of their company and whose services may not be limited to just singing badly and pouring your drinks. It's highly advisable not to venture into these unless you're absolutely sure somebody else is footing the bill, which can easily run into hundreds of dollars even if you keep your pants on.\n\nAs elsewhere, never ",{"type":"'''","value":["never"]}," accept an invitation to a restaurant or bar from an available-looking woman who just picked you up in the street sometime after sundown. At best, suggest a different place. If she refuses, drop her on the spot. More than likely, she will steer you into a quiet little place with too many doormen and you will find yourself saddled with a modest meal and beer that will cost you ¥1,000 or worse. And the doormen won't let you leave till you pay up. This is somewhat rare. But it does happen.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Tea"]},"\n\nChina is the birthplace of tea, and at the risk of stating the obvious, there's a lot of ",{"type":"'''","value":["tea"]}," (茶 ",{"type":"''","value":["chá"]},") in China. Green tea (绿茶 ",{"type":"''","value":["lǜchá"]},") is served up for free in some restaurants (depending on region) or for a small fee. The most common types served are:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["gunpowder tea"]}," (珠茶 ",{"type":"''","value":["zhūchá"]},"): a green tea so-named not after the taste but after the appearance of the bunched-up leaves used to brew it (the Chinese name \"pearl tea\" is rather more poetic)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["jasmine tea"]}," (茉莉花茶 ",{"type":"''","value":["mòlihuachá"]},"): green-tea scented with jasmine flowers"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["oolong"]}," (烏龍 ",{"type":"''","value":["wūlóng"]},"): a half-fermented mountain tea."]},"\nHowever, specialist tea houses serve a vast variety of brews, ranging from the pale, delicate white tea (白茶 ",{"type":"''","value":["báichá"]},") to the powerful fermented and aged pu'er tea (普洱茶 pǔ'ěrchá).\n\nTea in China is priced like wine in Western culture; a product that is any of well-known, high-quality or rare can be rather costly and one that is two or three of those can be amazingly expensive. As with wines, the cheapest stuff should usually be avoided and the high-priced products left to buyers who either are experts themselves or have expert advice, but there are many good choices in the middle price ranges. Tea shops typically sell by the jing (500g, a little over a pound); prices start around ¥50 a jing and there are many quite nice teas in the ¥100-300 range. Most shops will also have more expensive teas; prices up to ¥2,000 a jing are fairly common. The record price for top grade tea, both high quality and rare, sold at auction was ",{"type":"''","value":["¥9,000 per gram"]},".\n\nVarious areas of China have famous teas, but the same type of tea will come in many different grades, much as there are many different burgundies at different costs. Hangzhou, near Shanghai, is famed for its \"Dragon Well\" (龙井 ",{"type":"''","value":["lóngjǐng"]},")  green tea. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fujian"]]}," has the most famous oolong teas, \"Dark Red Robe\" (大红袍 ",{"type":"''","value":["dàhóngpáo"]},") from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mount Wuyi"]]}," and \"Iron Goddess of Mercy\" (铁观音 ",{"type":"''","value":["tiěguānyīn"]},") from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Anxi"]]},". ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pu'er"]]}," in Yunnan has the most famous fully fermented tea, ",{"type":"''","value":["pǔ'ěrchá"]}," (普洱茶). This comes compressed into hard cakes, originally a packing method for transport by horse caravan to Burma and Tibet. The cakes are embossed with patterns; some people hang them up as wall decorations.\n\nMost tea shops will be more than happy to let you sit down and try different varieties of tea. \"Ten Fu Tea\" is a national chain and in Beijing \"Wu Yu Tai\" is the one some locals say they favor.\n\nBlack tea, the type of tea most common in the West, is known in China as \"red tea\" (紅茶 ",{"type":"''","value":["hóngchá"]},"). While almost all Western teas are black teas, the converse isn't true, with many Chinese teas, including the famed Pǔ'ěr also falling into the \"black tea\" category.\n\nNormal Chinese teas are always drunk neat, with the use of sugar or milk unknown. However, in some areas you will find Hong Kong style \"milk tea\" (奶茶 ",{"type":"''","value":["nǎichá"]},") or Tibetan \"butter tea\".  Taiwanese bubble tea (珍珠奶茶 ",{"type":"''","value":["Zhēnzhū Nǎichá"]},") is also popular and widely available; the \"bubbles\" are balls of tapioca and milk or fruit are often mixed in.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Coffee"]},"\n\nCoffee (咖啡 ",{"type":"''","value":["kāfēi"]},") is becoming quite popular in urban China, though it can be quite difficult to find in smaller towns.\n\nSeveral chains of coffee shops have branches in many cities, including Starbucks (星巴克), UBC Coffee (上岛咖啡), Ming Tien Coffee Language and SPR, which most Westerners consider the best of the bunch. All offer coffee, tea, and both Chinese and Western food, generally with good air conditioning, wireless Internet, and nice decor. In most locations they are priced at ¥15-40 or so a cup, but beware of airport locations where they sometimes charge around ¥70.\n\nThere are also lots of smaller independent coffee shops or local chains. These may also be high priced, but often they are somewhat cheaper than the big chains. Quality varies from excellent to abysmal.\n\nFor cheap coffee just to stave off withdrawal symptoms, there are several options. Go to a Western fast food chain (KFC, McD, etc.) for some ¥8 coffee. Additionally, almost any supermarket or convenience store will have both canned cold coffee and packets of instant Nescafé (usually pre-mixed with whitener and sugar) - just add hot water. It is common for travellers to carry a few packets to use in places like hotel rooms or on trains, where coffee may not be available but hot water almost always is.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Cold drinks"]},"\n\nMany drinks that are usually served chilled or with ice in the West are served at room temperature in China. Ask for beer or soda in a restaurant, and it may arrive at room temperature, though beer is more commonly served cold, at least in the summer. Water will generally be served hot. That is actually good, because only boiled (or bottled) water is safe to drink, but non-Chinese generally do not find it pleasant to drink hot water in the summer.\n\nYou can get cold drinks from small grocery stores and restaurants, just look for the cooler (even though it might not actually be cool). You can try bringing a cold beverage into a restaurant. Most small restaurants won't mind—if they even notice—and there is no such thing as a \"cork\" charge in China. Remember that most people will be drinking tea, which is free anyway, so the restaurant is probably not expecting to profit on your beverage consumption.\n\nAsking for ice is best avoided. Many, perhaps most, places just don't have it. The ice they do have may well be made from unfiltered tap water and arguably unsafe for travellers sweating bullets about diarrhea.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nAvailability of accommodation for tourists is generally good and ranges from shared dorm rooms to 5 star luxury hotels. In the past, tourists' ability to stay in lower range accommodation was quite restricted but this has changed for many cities such that restrictions now vary from city to city and even in restricted cities and towns, family run operations in particular may check you in if they feel they can get enough information from you to get you registered in the system or feel that they can get away without such reporting.\n\nFinding a hotel when first arriving in a Chinese city can be a daunting task: a mob of passengers is pushing to disembark from the train or bus, touts are tugging at your arm and screaming in your face to go with them, everything is in incomprehensible Chinese and you are just looking for a place to put down your bag. It doesn't get any better once you get in a cab because the driver doesn't speak any English and every hotel in your guide book is full or closed! This can be the experience for many travellers in China, but the pains of finding a hotel room can be avoided if you know where to look and what you're looking for. In addition, star ratings especially for two and three-star hotels generally cannot be trusted in China. Pricing is a much better guide.\n\nIf you're willing to pay ¥180 or more for a room, you'll probably have little problem finding a room. You could, for example, search Google Maps with the name of a chain hotel listed under \"mid-range\", below, determine what the address would be in Chinese, and then write that down on a note which you give to a taxi driver.  If you want to look for something cheaper or more options, you could consider ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["hostels"]]}]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["dorms"]},", and extra rooms called ",{"type":"'''","value":["zhusu"]},". ",{"type":"'''","value":["Sleeper trains"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["sleeper buses"]}," can also be a decent option if you schedule your long-distance travel overnight (see the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Get around"],["Get around"]]}," section of this page for more information). If you're in a town and you can't find a hotel, try looking near the bus or train station, an area that typically has a larger selection of cheap hotels. Hotels that are not licensed to accept foreigners can be heavily fined if they are caught housing foreign occupants, but enforcement of this law appears spotty and many unlicensed hotels will find you a room anyway.  On rare occasions, someone from your hotel will escort you to the local police station to satisfy the establishment's reporting requirement.\n\nMany ultra-cheap options are used as temporary housing by migrant workers and would not appeal to most travellers from developed countries for security and cleanliness reasons.  In the cheapest range of hotels it is important to ask if hot water is available 24 hours-a-day (有没有二十四个小时的热水 ",{"type":"''","value":["yǒuméiyǒu èrshisì ge xiǎoshí de rèshuǐ"]},"), and check if the shower, sink and toilet actually work. It is also advisable to avoid checking into a room next to a busy street as traffic may keep you up late and wake you up early. If you do plan on just showing up in town and looking for a place to sleep, it's best to arrive before 18:00 or the most popular places will be booked for the night.\n\nNote that if you are absolutely at a loss for finding housing, you should seek out the local police (警察) or Public Security Bureau (公安局). They can help you find a place to crash - at least for one night.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Prices are often negotiable,"]}," and a sharp reduction from the price listed on the wall can often be had, even in nicer hotels, by simply asking \"what's the lowest price?\" (最低多少 ",{"type":"''","value":["zuìdī duōshǎo"]},"). When staying for more than a few days it is also usually possible to negotiate a lower daily rate. However, these negotiating tactics won't work during the busy Chinese holiday seasons when prices sky-rocket and rooms are hard to get. Many hotels, both chains and individual establishments, have membership cards offering discounts to frequent guests.\n\nIn mid-range and above hotels, it was once quite common for guests to receive phone calls offering \"massage\" services (that actually offered additional physical services) but this has became rarer such that male guests might just encounter business cards stuffed under the door.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Booking a room over the Internet"]}," with a credit card can be a convenient and speedy method of making sure you have a room when you arrive at your destination, and there are numerous websites that cater for this.

Some new ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.dajiudian.info online services"]}," allow you to book without a credit card and pay cash at the hotel. During Chinese holidays, when it is difficult to get a room anywhere, this may be an acceptable option, but in the off-season rooms are plentiful almost everywhere and it may be just as easy to find a room upon arrival as it is to book one over the Internet.\n\nAcross China, check-out is normally noon, and there is often the possibility of paying half a day's cost to get an 18:00 checkout.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Low-cost housing"]},"\n\nThere are various ways to sleep very cheaply in China: hostels, dorms, zhusu, massage shops, saunas, and spas.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hostels (青年旅社)"]}," are, by far, the most comfortable low-cost options. They typically cater to foreigners, have English speaking employees, and can provide cheap, convenient transport around town. Some of them are even cleaner and better furnished than more expensive places. Hostels also have a cozy, international atmosphere and are a good place to meet other travellers and get some half-decent Western food, which can be a godsend after days or weeks surviving off rice and noodles. In most cities of any size there is at least one hostel available, and in travel hot spots such as Beijing, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yangshuo"]]},", Dali, and Chengdu there are plenty of hostel options, although they can still fill up quickly because of their popularity with backpackers. Hostels can often be booked on-line in advance although you definitely should bring a print out of your confirmation as not all hostels are aware you can book their rooms (and pay a portion of the cost) on-line in advance. In Beijing, many hostels are located in ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hutongs"]}," - traditional courtyard homes in the midst of a maze of traditional streets and architecture.

The price can be quite low, costing only a few dozen renminbi. Officially a zhusu should not provide a room to a foreigner, but many times the caretaker is eager to get a client and will be willing to rent to anyone.

This is ideal if you are travelling light. Furthermore spas often provide complimentary food, and paid services such as massages and body scrubbing. There is no privacy because usually everyone sleeps in one room. However, there is more security than in a dorm, since there are attendants who watch over the area, and your belongings (even your clothes!) are stored away in the lockers. Don't be fooled when receptionists try to make up reasons why you have to pay more than the listed rate. They may try to convince you that the listed rates are only for members, locals, women, men, or include only one part of the spa (i.e. shower, but no bed\/couch). To verify any claims, strike up a conversation with a local a good distance away from the spa and inquire about the prices. Don't let them know that you are checking the spa's claims.

One problem with such hotels is that they can be quite noisy as patrons and staff may be yelling to each other across the halls into the wee hours of the morning. Another potential inconvenience is taking a room with a shared bath as you may have to wait to use a shower or squat toilet that moreover isn't in any sort of appealing condition. In smaller budget hotels the family running the place may simply lock up late at night when it appears no more customers are coming.

There are suites in Shanghai, for example, for over ¥10,000 a night.  Many of these establishments cater to travelling business-types with expense accounts and charge accordingly for food and amenities (i.e. ¥20 for a bottle of water which costs ¥2 at a convenience store).

Chinese three and four-star hotels will often give block pricing or better deals if you negotiate or book a room for more than 5 days.

Partial scholarships will cover tuition fees only. Full scholarships cover pretty much everything, including books, rent, some medical coverage, and a monthly allowance for food and expenses. Although studying pins you down to a specific city and limits the time you can spend travelling, a scholarship is a great way to help you cut through some red tape, get a Residence Permit and, if you're lucky, live in China practically for free.\n\nTo enquire about scholarships, directly contact the embassy in your area, or ask around at universities and language schools that have China-related courses. Scholarships are distributed by quota to each country therefore you will be competing against your fellow citizens, not against the entire world. The procedure varies from country to country, but normally requires the following paperwork:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" authorised copies of your highest (preferably university) degree, including exam scores;"]},{"type":"*","value":[" two letters of recommendation"]},{"type":"*","value":[" proof of a full health check-up (blood-test, ECG, X-Ray, etc)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" your reason for study"]},{"type":"*","value":[" plenty of passport-sized photos"]},"\nAll of this is shipped by the embassy to Beijing, which then decides who is accepted, where, and under what conditions. Applications are usually decided by the end of March, but the answer may not come until as late as August, with classes starting in September.\n\nIf all goes well, this will get you a letter of acceptance by the university of your choice, plus a visa that lets you stay in China for about two months. Once in China, you will have to do the medical tests all over again, and upgrade the visa to a residence permit. This is where being part of a university comes in handy, as they should be able to handle all of the paperwork, going so far as to bring a medical team on campus to check you up — more preferable to running from police station to hospital to consulate, especially if you don't speak Chinese!\n\nWhen all is said and done, you will have a residence permit that lets you stay one year in China, lets you leave and enter the country as you want, and a fair ability to travel during weekends, holidays, and the occasional class-skipping stint.\n\nFor more information, visit the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.csc.edu.cn\/en\/ China Scholarship Council"]}," and ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cscse.edu.cn China Service Center for Scholarly Exchanges"]}," websites.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Work"]},"\n\nMost foreign nationals working in China are required to obtain a residence permit before taking employment.

This is in effect a one-year multiple entry visa; a permit holder can leave China and return with no difficulty. Obtaining the permit is not straightforward, the rules change frequently and sometimes without notice, and the rules can sometimes be bent if the employer has good contacts or influence. Hence the following information should be taken as a guideline only.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Residence permit procedure "]},"\nGetting a residence permit generally requires dealing with two organisations, the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.safea.gov.cn\/english\/ State Administration for Foreign Expert Affairs"]}," (SAFEA), which is Beijing-based but has offices around the country, and the local Public Security Bureau (PSB, the cops).\n\nSAFEA issues a Foreign Expert's Certificate (FEC) or a Foreign Teacher's Certificate (FTC). In theory, the FTC is for elementary or high school teachers and the FEC is for tertiary education or experts in industry. In some cases an entirely different certificate issued by a provincial department of labour can be used instead. In practice, nearly everyone seems to get the FEC. In theory, both FEC and FTC require a degree; this is usually, but not always, enforced. Whether it is depends at least on where you are, how well-connected your employer is, and how much trouble they are willing to go to. If you lack a degree, it helps if you have other certifications or diplomas.\n\nOnce you have an FEC or equivalent, getting the residence permit is routine. It requires an appearance at the local PSB, registration of your residence address with them, a small fee, and a health certificate. If you complete your health certificate in your home country, be sure to get copies of the x-ray, lab reports and other machine documents. Also have the form stamped with the official seal of the hospital. Even though you do all of this you will quite likely be required to take another physical in China. The physical is usually very quick: EKG, chest x-ray, sonogram of heart and stomach area, blood test, and urine check.  However, the time of completion and various tests may change depending on the province.\n\nIn most cases, a Chinese member of the employer's staff — in English, the Foreign Affairs Officer (FAO), in Chinese the ",{"type":"''","value":["wai ban"]}," (outsider boss) — will guide foreign employees through this process and even handle much of it for them, and the employer will cover part or all of the costs. These may be points to negotiate before coming. Your spouse and any children going with you may require an even higher amount for their residence permit.\n\nMuch the safest way to come to a job in China is to enter the country on a Z visa. There can be some confusion with the terms; a few years ago, the Z was a one-year working visa but now the Residence Permit is the long-term visa and the Z is just an entry visa good for 30 days, long enough to get the FEC and Residence Permit. The Z visa can only be obtained outside of China, and it requires a letter from the employers to accompany your passport when you apply. Generally the school will request a signed contract, a health certificate (the more official-looking stamps, the better), a copy of your passport details, and a copy of your diploma.  If you are over 60 and they are asking for their provincial office to accept you, they may also require that you have your own health insurance.\n\nPeople over 60 often have trouble getting visas because of their age, and some job ads specify an age range. There are conflicting reports on whether this is SAFEA policy, SAFEA advice to provincial departments that make their own policies, or a question of health insurance. There are some exceptions, including a few people in their seventies still working legally, but there are also cases of people being asked to leave because they were turning 60 or 65.\n\nIt used to be common for people already in China to go to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Macau"]]}," in order to apply for their Z visa. Around the time of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the rules tightened up considerably; they have relaxed some since, but not entirely. This is also true for getting Chinese visas in other nearby countries such as Vietnam, Korea, Japan or Singapore. Some people have been told they must return to their home countries to obtain a Z visa. Others have been able to get a Z visa in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong"]]},", provided the invitation paperwork clearly stipulates it.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Language Teaching"]},"\nTeaching a language, most commonly English, is a very popular source of employment for foreigners. There are ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Teaching English"],["English-teaching"]]}," jobs all over China.\n\nThe market for teachers of other languages is more limited. However most universities require all students majoring in a foreign language to study another language as well, so they all have to teach at least two. The most common combination is English and Japanese, but many universities will happily hire a qualified instructor for another major language whenever they find one. Also, there are specialised universities for foreign languages in major cities such as ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.bfsu.edu.cn Beijing"]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/english.gwnews.net\/ Guangzhou"]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.xisu.edu.cn\/waiyuan\/12.htm Xi'an"]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/edawai.dlufl.edu.cn\/ Dalian"]}," and ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.shisu.edu.cn\/SISUenglish\/ Shanghai"]}," which teach most major world languages. Guangzhou is establishing a reputation as a hub for so-called ",{"type":"''","value":["rare"]}," languages.\n\nRequirements and qualifications range from just having a pulse and speaking a bit of English up to needing an MA and experience. Typically the good jobs want at least one, preferably two or three, of:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" a 4-year degree"]},{"type":"*","value":[" a teaching certificate for primary school or high school from your own country"]},{"type":"*","value":[" a recognised TEFL certificate, e.g. Cambridge ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cambridgeesol.org\/teaching\/celta.htm CELTA"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" teaching experience"]},"\n",{"type":"''","value":["If you want to go and do not already have good qualifications, get a TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) certificate"]},". It really helps.\n\nThere are fairly strong preferences for native English speakers and for citizens of major English-speaking countries. Job ads routinely include a list of acceptable passports; UK, US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand are on every list, Ireland and South Africa on most. Many employers will not even read the rest of your resume if you do not have one of those passports. Various prejudices and stereotypes may also come into play; some schools prefer Caucasians, especially blue-eyed blondes, apparently because they hope the \"right\" image will help their marketing. Overseas Chinese (even with perfect English), Filipinos, Indians, Malaysians, American Blacks, and especially Africans all report some difficulties finding jobs, or getting lower offers. Members of all those groups are happily employed in other schools, and many are well-paid, but getting a job is easier if you fit the stereotype. Accent can also be an issue; almost any educated native speaker will be fine, but if you sound like you are from rural Queensland or the hills of Virginia or are working-class Glaswegian, then some employers will not want you.\n\nPay and conditions vary greatly depending on location, experience and qualifications. Free accommodation, provided by the institution, is common. Generally this means an apartment of your own, though some tight-fisted schools want teachers to share. Most jobs pay for all or part of an annual trip home. Teachers nearly always make enough to live well in China, though some have a problem in summer because many university or high school jobs pay for only the 10 months of the academic year. Foreign teachers generally earn much more than their Chinese colleagues' salaries but the differences are gradually narrowing. A public college or university will often pay less than a private school, but will also require fewer teaching hours.\n\nIt is often possible to teach private lessons on the side - in fact your students or their parents may ask about this incessantly - or to find part-time work at another school in addition to your main job. Make certain you understand your employer's policies on outside work as some are quite restrictive. The standard SAFEA-provided ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.china-tesol.com\/SAFEA_Contract\/safea_contract.html contract"]},", which most schools use (perhaps amended a bit), prohibits it entirely unless you get permission from the employer.\n\nThere can be difficulties around Foreign Expert Certificates for teachers. Universities and other public institutions can easily get FECs for staff, but not all private schools can. Before they can even apply for certificates, they must be authorised to employ foreigners by SAFEA. Getting the authorization takes many months and a significant amount of money. They also have to comply with SAFEA standards such as providing housing, health insurance and annual air fare home for all staff. Large established schools have the permission, but many of the smaller ones don't want the expense. Without the FEC you cannot get a Residence Permit so all the teachers in such schools are working illegally.\n \nIn terms of work visas, schools range from completely reliable to crooks who leave foreigners stranded without a legitimate work visa after they arrive. It is illegal to work with a tourist visa, but some schools want teachers to do that, and some even want teachers to foot the bill for \"visa runs\" to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong"]]}," to renew it. Some even lie to teachers about this when recruiting. Some employers ask teachers to come in with a tourist visa and promise that they can get a residence permit later. The official regulations require the Z visa but moving from a tourist visa to Residence Permit is sometimes possible, depending on policies at the local PSB office and the employer's contacts there. On the other hand, working on a tourist visa is illegal and some of the employers who want you to come on one are stringing you along; they do not have SAFEA permission to hire foreigners legally and are trying to wriggle around that.\n\n",{"type":"''","value":["Do not even consider taking a post anywhere that wants you to come on a tourist visa unless you have talked to current foreign teachers and been assured that they came that way and had no problem getting FEC and Residence Permit"]},".\n\nIf you plan to work as a teacher in China, research ",{"type":"''","value":["very"]}," carefully. You might get your dream job or a nightmare. Take great care in your selection of employer; broken contracts and general unscrupulousness and dishonesty are common. As a rule, government schools give the best all-around deals and if there is any dispute, you can appeal to the Foreign Experts Office of the provincial education ministry. If you can document your case and it is a valid one, they will take action. And it tends to be fast. Before filing an appeal, try to resolve the issue through direct discussion. If that fails, ask someone to function as a go-between—a Chinese if possible, but otherwise another expatriate will do. Only appeal as a last resort: as in other aspects of life everywhere, the threat of action is often more effective than action itself.\n\nSee also ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Teaching English"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Other Professions"]},"\nThere are opportunities in the main cities for professionals with backgrounds in areas such as finance, engineering, or information technology. Generally speaking you will need to be sponsored by a company in China that has a certificate to hire foreigners. There is significant paperwork involved around your Z visa as well as taxes, and it is advisable that your company uses an agency to take care of these on your behalf. If you have do paperwork by yourself then you will find it very difficult and time consuming, even if you can read simplified Chinese.\n\nIn previous years, companies were happy to fly in expatriate managers in order to develop their Chinese operations, although for both cost and cultural reasons there is now definitely a stronger preference for hiring workers and management locally. The cost of relocating and paying a foreigner is very high compared to the local workforce and companies will look for unique capabilities that you can bring, rather than generic 'middle managers'.\n\nOpportunities for expatriates are usually far greater at multi-national companies with a significant China office than in local Chinese companies.\n\nMany expatriates who wish to work in China actually base themselves in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong"]]},", owing to having a simple immigration process, easier living conditions for foreigners, low taxes and ready access to the Chinese mainland.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Crime"]},"\n\nChina is a huge country that shows a huge regional difference in crime rates but in general it poses no more risk than most western countries. Although you may hear locals complaining about increasing crime rates, violent crime remains rare. Many tourists will more likely feel safer in China than in their home country.\n\nGenerally speaking, crime rates are higher in the larger cities than in the countryside.

In big cities you may hear a stories of locals who have lost three bikes within one month, but in some other places, local people still casually park their bikes. Follow what local people do. If you see bikes are parked anywhere, just park yours or, better, tie it to a pole. In a place where everyone takes their bikes inside restaurants or internet cafes, it's a warning sign. Assume your expensive lock won't help at all. Professional thieves can break virtually any lock. In China, bike parking is common outside supermarkets or shopping centres, and usually charges ¥1-2 per day (usually until 20:00-22:00). If you have an electric bicycle or scooter, pay extra caution as the battery-packs may be targeted.\n\nOn long journey buses, there have been a handful of reports that groups of robbers have mugged all the passengers on board, especially on buses leaving from Shenzhen. Today, all passengers are required to take a mug shot before boarding. You're expected to follow the norm rather than discussing any privacy issues this may raise. Since this measure was introduced, reports of muggings have dropped drastically.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Traffic"]},"\n\nWhile it's true that China claims more lives in car accidents than any country in the world, that is mainly due to its extremely high population. Its mortality rate per head remains lower than that of many Western countries. But that said, in general, the driving in China can range from anywhere from nerve-rattling to outright reckless.\n\nTraffic rules are usually practiced half-halfheartedly and rarely if ever enforced. Cars are allowed to turn right on a red light and do not stop for pedestrians, regardless of the walk signal. Bikers and electro-bikes tend to do as they like. Don't be fooled by following any signs and pedestrian paths; it is very common to see a motorcycle driving in a pedestrian lane. On occasion even cars will take to bike lanes and motor bikes to the sidewalk. Equally, pedestrians often walk in the roadways, especially at night, as they are better lit. Look in all directions when crossing! Expect or assume that anything will come at or behind you from any direction at any time.\n\nSee also ",{"type":"[[","value":[["driving in China"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Terrorism"]},"\n\nIn recent years there have been an increasing number of terrorist attacks in China, with some high profile attacks on people in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guangzhou"]]}," station, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kunming"]]}," station and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beijing"]]},".

It is however never far off the scene and particularly common just outside the main tourist attractions and in major transportation hubs.\n\nBe aware of child beggars who could be victims of child trafficking. While it is becoming less common, you should avoid giving them any money. There have been several reports in local media about begging con artists who abduct children and pretend to be their mother in order to beg for money.\n\nIn China, local people usually only give money to those who have obviously lost the ability to earn money. Professional beggars have very clear deformities.

No trip to China will be complete without visiting at least one of the many Buddhist temples. Unfortunately, the presence of foreign tourists unaware of local Buddhist customs has also given rise to many scams, with many fake monks and temples preying on unsuspecting visitors.\n\nNote that Buddhism in China generally follows the Mahayana school, in contrast to the Theravada school which is dominant in Myanmar, Thailand and Sri Lanka. Mahayana Buddhist monks are required to be vegetarian, and usually grow their own food in the temples, or buy their food using temple donations. As such, they generally ",{"type":"''","value":["do not"]}," beg for food.\n\nMonks also do not sell religious items (these are sold by laymen, not monks), and neither do they offer \"Buddha's blessing\" in exchange for money, or threaten you with misfortune should you not donate. Most temples will have a donation box in the main hall for devotees to make donations should they wish to do so, and monks will never go out in public to ask for donations. According to traditional Buddhist philosophy, it is entirely up to an individual to decide whether and how much he\/she wishes to donate, and genuine Buddhist temples will never use high-pressure tactics to solicit donations, or ask for any amount of money in exchange for services. Monks also follow a very strict daily routine, and are not allowed to indulge in material luxuries, consume alcohol, or have any form of sexual activity.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Pollution"]},"\n\nPollution is a serious problem in the world's factory. Beijing, by some accounts, is the most polluted city in the world. 16 out of the 20 most polluted cities in the world are in China.

Even the countryside, depending on the province in question, is not immune.\n\nPlaces at higher altitudes or plains like parts of Yunnan and Sichuan, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Tibet and outlying islands such as Hainan usually have good air quality. Visitors should be prepared to see smog, which can be quite heavy, in nearly all large cities, including those on the coast.\n\nYou will also hear a lot of noise. Construction and renovation are full-time activities. Chinese and long-time residents' ears are trained to filter and tolerate it.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Scams"]},"\n\n: ",{"type":"''","value":["See also: ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Common scams"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pickpockets"]]}]},"\n\nTouristy parts of Beijing and Shanghai have become notorious for various scams. The most notorious is the \"teahouse scam.\" Variants can be seen at bars and cafes as well. While some scamming teahouses have been raided by the police in recent years, there are still a considerable number of scam reports from travellers and even local Chinese.\n\nAround Tiananmen Square and Wangfujing in Beijing and the Bund, People's Square, and Nanjing Road in Shanghai, a scam artist(s) may start a conversation in relatively fluent English. They sometimes help you bargain and show you around. Everything is fine until they invite you to go to a teahouse, cafe or pub, place the orders before you have a chance to speak (or the tea and drinks were already laid out) and leave you facing an extortionate bill. At times, the scammers work in teams to increase the amount which can be ordered. Never begin sampling tea or other items without first getting, examining and keeping the written menu. Be sure to do the ordering or else agree with your hosts on anything which will be purchased.\n\nWhile not exactly a scam, teahouse staff will bring snacks to your table and ask if you want something. The prices are not listed and neither are they mentioned when you take something. Note that the peanuts, sunflower seeds, raisins, etc., you take are ",{"type":"''","value":["not"]}," complementary. You will have to pay for them. In ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai"]]},", one foreigner was reportedly taken to a teahouse by a group of women, given a bill for over ¥7,000 and threatened by the owner. The tourist called the police which prompted a swift raid on the teahouse.\n\nAnother scam, especially around Wangfujing, is to claim to be \"art students\" with an exhibition. You will be taken to small shabby art shops and pressured to buy overpriced reproductions. The same scam has been observed around the Forbidden City in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beijing"]]},".  \n\nIf you find yourself being or having been scammed then call 110 and report it immediately. The police are sensitive to foreigners being targeted in this way and giving the country a poor reputation. In China, you have a legal right to ask for a \"fa piao\" (发票) which is an official sales invoice issued by the taxation department. It is against the law for an owner to refuse to give it to you. For scams, they generally will refuse since it is legal evidence of their extortionate price. If you have already been a victim then you can consider returning to the shop with some friends, ask for a refund and threaten to call the police. If you pay by credit card then you may be able to get the charges reversed. \n\nPlease note that while it is important to avoid being scammed, bear in mind that it is still common for English-speaking Chinese to genuinely want to start a conversation with you - even in touristy areas, show you around, and invite you for a drink and a meal. If you are paranoid about all invitations and interactions with the Chinese, it will ruin your travel experience.\n\nWhen a stranger on the street invites you for tea or a drink, you should choose your own place, stating that you feel like eating or giving some other reason for your choice. If they are weirdly persistent at going to their \"place\" and make endless excuses to turn down your suggestions, use your common sense to tell if it's a scam.\n\nFinally, high prices do not necessarily indicate a scam. In a teahouse or bar, ¥50-200 per cup or pot of tea (including hot water refills) and ¥15-60 per bottle of beer is not uncommon. Tea samplings may also charge high prices for each sample. Once again, to avoid being scammed, simply ask for and keep the menu. Although it is perfectly possible to pay ¥1,000 or more for a single pot of tea in a high-end teahouse, run-of-the-mill teas should not be nearly this expensive. Such delicate tea would only be offered to tea gourmets, not a casual tea taster. Furthermore, it is considered socially offensive to take a new friend to spend so much money and expect them to pay the bill. If someone takes you to an expensive place and expects you to pay, it is most likely a scam.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Illicit drugs"]},"\n\nPossession or trafficking of illicit drugs is a very serious offence in China, and possession of certain drugs may lead to capital punishment.

In cities, it varies from place to place. High quality bathrooms can be found inside major tourist attractions (e.g., the Forbidden City), at international hotels, office buildings, and upper-class department stores. Washrooms in McDonald's, KFC, Pizza Hut, or any of the coffee chains listed in the drink section are usually more or less clean. While those in common restaurants and hotels are barely acceptable, those in hotel rooms are generally very clean. Some public facilities are free, others cost from a few mao up to one or two kuai (¥1-2). Separate facilities are always provided for men (男 nán) and women (女 nǚ), but sometimes there are no doors on the front of the stalls.\n\nThe sit-down toilet familiar to Westerners is rare in China in public areas. Hotels will generally have them in rooms, but in places where Westerners are scarce, expect to find squat toilets more often than not. Many private homes in urban areas now have sit down toilets, and one major benefit from having a local host is that they have clean bathrooms. As a rule of thumb, a western establishment such as McDonald's will have a western toilet.\n\nCarry your own tissue paper (卫生纸 wèishēngzhǐ, or 面纸 miànzhǐ) as it is rarely provided. You can sometimes buy it from the money-taker at a public toilet; you can also buy it in bars, restaurants and Internet cafes for ¥2. Put used paper in the bucket next to the toilet; do not flush it away as it may block the often poor plumbing systems.\n\nThe Chinese tend to distrust the cleanliness of bathtubs. In hotels with fixed bathtubs, disposable plastic bathtub liners may be provided.\n\nWash your hands often with soap, or better carry some disposable disinfectant tissues (found in almost any department or cosmetics store), especially after having used public computers; the main cause for getting a cold or flu is through touching your face, especially the nose, with infected hands.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Food & drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Food"]},"\nThere are no widely enforced health regulations in restaurants. Restaurants generally prepare hot food when you order. Even in the smallest of restaurants, hot dishes are usually freshly prepared, instead of reheated, and rarely cause health problems. Most of the major cities have fast food chain places, and the hygiene in them tends to be good. Use common sense when buying food from street vendors. This is especially true for meat or seafood products; they can be very unsafe, particularly during warm weather as many vendors don't have refrigeration.\n\nA rule of thumb regarding street food is to make certain it is cooked thoroughly while you are watching; also, visit stalls frequented by locals, and look for plastic-wrapped disposable chopsticks. Minor stomach discomfort may still be experienced from street food and restaurant food alike, but is said to pass as one becomes accustomed to the local food. Ginger is effective against nausea, though it does not kill bacteria.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nChinese people do not drink water straight from the tap, even in the cities, and you should not either.

While some of the newer hospitals in major cities like Shanghai and Beijing are equipped with the most cutting edge medical technology, overcrowding is a problem in many of the other hospitals, with the quality of care in these hospitals leaving much to be desired. Local doctors have been known to prescribe more expensive treatments than necessary; IV drips are routine prescriptions in China, even for minor ailments like flu and the common cold, and doctors have a tendency to liberally prescribe antibiotics. Most locals go to the hospital even for the most minor ailments. You should consider keeping a significant amount of cash readily available for emergencies, since not being able to pay upfront may delay treatment.\n\nAmbulance services are expensive, require upfront payment, are not accorded much priority on the roads and are therefore not particularly fast. Taking a taxi to the hospital in an emergency will often be much quicker.\n\nCommon therapeutic drugs — things like penicillin or insulin — are generally available from a pharmacist with a prescription and considerably cheaper than in western countries. You can usually ask to see the instructions that came with the box. Western medicine is called xīyào (西药). Less common drugs are often imported, hence expensive. \n\nIn larger cities there are strong controls over medicine, and even 'standard' cold medicine such as Panadol may require a prescription or a foreign passport.

The doctors and nurses will speak English, and are often hired from, or have obtained their medical qualifications in Western countries. These provide a very easy and comfortable way to obtain familiar Western treatment from doctors qualified in the West, although you will be paying a premium for these services starting at an eye-watering ¥1,000 just for the consultation.

In some parts of China it is acceptable to re-use needles, albeit after sterilization.\n\nFor acupuncture, although the disposable needles are quite common in mainland China, you can provide your own needles if you prefer. The disposable type, called Wujun zhenjiu zhen (无菌針灸針, Sterilized acupuncture needles), usually cost ¥10-20 per 100 needles and are available in many pharmacy. Note that there should be minimal to no bleeding when the needle is inserted and removed if the acupuncturist is sufficiently skilled.\n\nWhile Traditional Chinese Medicine is widespread in China, regulation tends to be lax and it is not unheard of for Chinese physicians to prescribe herbs which are actually detrimental to one's health. Do some research and ensure you have some trusted local friends to help you out if you wish to see a Chinese physician. Alternatively, head to Hong Kong or Taiwan instead, as the practice is better regulated there.\n\nIf making more than a short trip to China, it may be a good idea to get vaccinated against Hepatitis A and Typhoid as they can be spread via contaminated food.\n\nParts of southern China have ",{"type":"[[","value":[["mosquitoes"]]}," which transmit ",{"type":"[[","value":[["malaria"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["dengue fever"]]},", etc.\n\nChina has only officially recognized the threat of an AIDS\/HIV epidemic since 2001.

Gay scenes and communities are found in the major cities in China, but generally non-existant everywhere else. Most Chinese are reluctant to discuss their sexuality in public, as it is generally considered to be a personal matter. In addition, homosexual marriages and unions are not recognised anywhere in the country.

If you need a phone as well, prices start around ¥100\/200 used\/new. Chinese phones, unlike those sold in some Western countries, are never \"locked\" and will work with any SIM card you put in them.\n\nChina's two big operators are ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.chinamobile.com\/en\/mainland\/ China Mobile"]}," and ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/eng.chinaunicom.com\/ China Unicom"]},". ",{"type":"''","value":["Most"]}," SIMs sold by the two work nationwide, with Unicom allowing Hong Kong\/Macau\/Taiwan usage as well. There is usually a surcharge of about ¥1\/min when roaming outside the province you bought the SIM, and there are some cards that work only in a single province, so check when buying. You may also need to manually activate national roaming, which may incur a small daily surcharge as long as it's active. PHS handsets no longer work since the associated network has been taken down. For China mobile, you can get your credits balances by calling 1008611 and get a sms with balance.\n\nInternational calls have to be enabled separately by applying for China Mobile's \"12593\" or China Unicom's \"17911\" service; Neither provider requires a deposit, though both require applications. Usually there will be an English speaker, and let him\/her know what you want.  Ask for the \"special\" dialing code, and for ¥1\/month extra, this will be provided to you.  Enter the code, the country code, then the local number and you will be talking cheaply in no time.  Don't be fooled by cellphone shops with the China Mobile signage, be sure to go a to a location. The employees will wear a blue uniform and there will be counter services. At time of writing, China Mobile is the cheaper of the two with calls to North America\/Asia around ¥0.4\/min.  You can also use prepaid cards for international calling; just dial the number on the card as with a regular landline phone, and the charges will go to the prepaid calling card.   \n\nTo recharge, visit the neighborhood office of your mobile service provider, give the staff your number and pay in cash to recharge your account. Alternately, many shops will sell you a charge card, which has a number and password that must be used to call the telephone company to recharge the money in your account. You will be calling a computer and the default language is Chinese, which can be changed to English if you understand the Chinese. Charge cards are sold in denominations of ¥30, 50 and 100. (If you have a local bank account, and you understand Chinese, all providers let you recharge by bank transfer online; this is cheaper and sometimes there will be special offers for recharging this way)\n\nFor mobile data addicts, the \"Wo\" 3G USIM from China Unicom starts at ¥96\/month for 240 nationwide minutes, 10 videocall minutes, 300MB data, and some free multimedia\/text content (ringtones, mobile news reports, wallpapers, music videos, etc.). Incoming transmissions (video\/voice call, text) from anywhere is completely free. For short-term use there is no longer a basic service fee, with calls around ¥1\/3 min, text messages ¥0.10 each and data ¥10\/MB (overage for the ¥96 plan is a more reasonable ¥0.15\/min, ¥0.10 per text ¥0.3\/MB). The student plan (¥66 for 50 minutes, 240 texts, everything else same as ¥96 plan) is also an option. China Mobile offers their \"Easy Own\" prepaid card, the offer also includes the option of grps\/edge-packs: ¥100 or ¥200 for 1 or 2 GB of data a month. It's possible to de-\/activate this service with a short message to the number 10086. There is also a 5 G cap (maximum charge per month) of ¥500.\n\nSee also ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Telephone_service_for_travel#Mobile_phones"],["Mobile Phones"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Area codes"]},"\n\nThe country dialing code for mainland China is ",{"type":"'''","value":["86"]},".
