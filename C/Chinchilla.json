At the 2006 Census, it had a population of 3,681 people.\n\nSituated 300 km north-west of Brisbane on the Warrego Highway, don’t be fooled by how Chinchilla looks from the highway – the town actually lies across the railway bridge. There is plenty to see and do, and some really interesting local history.\n\nChinchilla is probably most famous for its biannual ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Chinchilla Melon Festival"],["Melon Festival"]]},{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.melonfest.com.au"]}," (the next will be held in February 2011), and its 'Chinchilla Red' ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Fossicking for Petrified Wood"],["petrified wood"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Understand "]},"\n\nHeeney Street is the main street of Chinchilla, and runs perpendicular to the highway. Most of the shops (and pubs) can be found along this street, although the main grocery store, and a complex with a few other shops and cafes, is on nearby Middle Street.\n\nThe Chinchilla Visitor Information Centre, located on the Warrego Highway, is a good place to make your first stop. The friendly staff can provide you with maps, pretty much any brochure you could wish for, and local knowledge. You can also relax on their lovely verandah with a Devonshire tea with freshly-made scones.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" History "]},"\n\nChinchilla was first officially recorded by Friedrich Wilhelm Ludwig Leichhardt in 1844 during one of his expeditions out west, and there is some debate over where the name ‘Chinchilla’ came from. There is a town named Chinchilla in Spain, or a small rodent called a Chinchilla (the fur of which was a valuable commodity - and early settlers in the Chinchilla area trapped possums for their fur). However, most agree that it came from the local Aboriginal word for the Cypress Pine, ",{"type":"''","value":["Jinchilla"]},". Local legend says that when the application for land was made in 1846 by the first white settler, Matthew Goggs, the Sydney Registrations Office changed the name from Jinchilla to Chinchilla.\n\nHowever, Chinchilla was officially surveyed and established in 1877. Its main industries were agriculture, timber and dairy. Today the main industry is agriculture, and Chinchilla is famous for its melons (which are delicious) – the town supplies approximately 25% of Australia’s melons.\n\nIn the 1890s, the prickly pear pandemic arrived in Chinchilla and everything they tried to remove the pear failed. In 1925 the government introduced ",{"type":"''","value":["Cactoblastis cactorum"]},", a moth from South America. It lays its eggs on the plant and when the larva hatches it eats its way through the plant, eventually killing it – it was so effective that it brought the pandemic under control after just one year.
