In English, it is often just called \"Mandarin\" or \"Chinese\". In China, it is called ",{"type":"''","value":["Putonghua"]}," (普通话), meaning \"common speech\", while in Taiwan it is referred to as ",{"type":"''","value":["Guoyu"]}," (國語), \"the national language.\" It has been the ",{"type":"'''","value":["main language of education in China"]}," (excluding ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Macau"]]},") since the 1950s.  Standard Mandarin is close to, but not quite identical with, the Mandarin dialect of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beijing"]]}," area.\n\nNote that while the spoken Mandarin in the above places is more or less the same, the written characters are different. Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau all still use ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chinese phrasebook - Traditional"],["traditional characters"]]},", whereas Mainland China and Singapore use a simplified derivative. However, an educated person who lives in mainland China or Singapore can still understand traditional characters but not necessarily vice versa (Taiwanese people may have difficulty recognizing some simplified characters)\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Map of sinitic languages-en.svg"],["thumb"],["285px"],["Map of Chinese dialects"]]},"\n\nNote that \"dialect\" has a different meaning when applied to Chinese from when it is applied to other languages. \n\nChinese \"dialects\" are mutually unintelligible, as different as, say, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Italian"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["French"]]},", which we would call \"related languages\" rather than \"dialects\" - using a pure linguistic definition they are distinct \"languages\".\n\t\nAll Chinese dialects, in general, use the same set of characters in reading and writing. A ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cantonese"]]}," speaker and a Mandarin speaker cannot talk to each other, but either can generally read what the other writes. Even a speaker of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Japanese"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Korean"]]}," will recognise many characters.\n\nWhile formal written Chinese is the same everywhere, there can be significant differences when the \"dialects\" are written in colloquial form. For example Cantonese as used in Hong Kong, more informal phrasings are used in everyday speech than what would be written. Thus, there are some extra characters that are sometimes used in addition to the common characters to represent the spoken dialect and other colloquial words.\n\nOne additional complication is that mainland ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Singapore"]]}," use ",{"type":"'''","value":["simplified characters"]},", a long-debated change completed by the mainland Chinese government in 1956 to facilitate the standardization of language across China's broad minority groups and sub-dialects of Mandarin and other Chinese languages. Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau and many overseas Chinese still use the ",{"type":"'''","value":["traditional characters"]},". The Dungan language, which is spoken in some neighbouring countries, is considered to be a variant of Mandarin but uses the Cyrillic alphabet instead of Chinese characters.\n\nAbout one fifth of the people in the world speak some form of Chinese as their native language. It is a tonal language that is related to ",{"type":"''","value":["Burmese"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["Tibetan"]},". The Vietnamese language (which uses a distinctive version of the Latin alphabet) has borrowed many words from Chinese and at one time used Chinese characters as well. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Korean"]]}," used to use the Chinese writing system, however in modern times it is not in general use although people still can read the basics and many Korean words are similar to their Mandarin counterpart. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Japanese"]]}," also uses the Chinese writing system, although over time the meaning of the characters has diverged significantly from those used in China.\n\nTravellers headed for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guangdong"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guangxi"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Macau"]]}," may find ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cantonese"]]}," more useful than Mandarin. Those heading for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Taiwan"]]}," or southern ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fujian"]]}," may find the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Minnan"]]}," dialect useful as well.\n\nChinese, like most other Asian languages such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Arabic"]]},", is infamous for being difficult to learn. While English speakers would initially have problems with the tones and recognizing the many different characters (Chinese has no alphabet), the grammar is very simple and can be picked up very easily. Most notably, Chinese grammar does not have conjugation, tenses, gender, plurals or other grammatical rules found in other major languages such as English or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["French"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Pronunciation guide"]},"\nThe pronunciation guide below uses Hanyu pinyin, the official romanization of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["People's Republic of China"]]},". Until recently, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Taiwan"]]}," used the Wade-Giles system, which is quite different, then switched to Tongyong pinyin, only slightly different from Hanyu pinyin, and now officially uses Hanyu pinyin just like the People's Republic.\n\nPinyin allows very accurate pronunciation of Chinese for those who understand it, although the way that it uses letters like ",{"type":"''","value":["q"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["x"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["c"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["z"]}," and even ",{"type":"''","value":["i"]}," is not at all intuitive to the English speaker since some of these sounds do not exist in English or many other languages. Thus, studying the pronunciation guide below carefully is essential. After you master the pronunciation you will need to move on to the next challenge: using accurate tones whilst speaking.\n\nWhile hanyu pinyin is immensely useful as a pronunciation guide for Mandarin learners, it is much less useful as a form of written communication, as many Chinese cannot read pinyin, and even those that do will often find it awkward. So stick to Chinese characters for written communication.\n\nSome pinyin vowels (especially \"e\", \"i\", \"ü\") can be tricky, so it is best to get a native speaker to demonstrate.
