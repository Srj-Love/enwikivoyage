In China, it is called ",{"type":"''","value":["Putonghua"]}," (普通话), meaning \"common speech\", while in Taiwan it is referred to as ",{"type":"''","value":["Guoyu"]}," (國語), \"the national language.\" It has been the ",{"type":"'''","value":["main language of education in China"]}," (excluding Hong Kong) since the 1950s. Standard Mandarin is close to, but not quite identical to, the Mandarin dialect of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beijing"]]}," area. Note that while the spoken Mandarin in the above places is more or less the same, the written characters are different. In Taiwan and Hong Kong, traditional characters are used, whereas China and Singapore use a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chinese phrasebook"],["simplified derivative"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Map of sinitic languages-en.svg"],["thumb"],["225px"],["Map of Chinese dialects"]]},"\n\nNote that \"dialect\" has a different meaning when applied to Chinese from when it is appied to other languages.\n\nChinese \"dialects\" are mutually unintelligible, as different as, say, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Italian"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["French"]]},", which we would call \"related languages\" rather than \"dialects\".\n\nAll Chinese dialects, in general, use the same characters in reading and writing. A ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cantonese"]]}," speaker and a Mandarin speaker cannot talk to each other, but either can generally read what the other writes. Even a speaker of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Japanese"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Korean"]]}," will recognise many characters.\n\nAn exception arises where in some spoken dialects, for example Cantonese as used in Hong Kong, more informal phrasings are used in everyday speech than what would be written. Thus, there are some extra characters that are sometimes used in addition to the common characters to represent the spoken dialect and other colloquial words.\n\nOne additional complication is that mainland ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Singapore"]]}," use ",{"type":"'''","value":["simplified characters"]},", a long-debated change completed by the mainland Chinese government in 1956 to facilitate the standardization of language across China's broad minority groups and sub-dialects of Mandarin and other Chinese languages. Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau and many overseas Chinese still use the ",{"type":"'''","value":["traditional characters"]},". In addition, the Dungan language, which is spoken in some parts of Russia, is considered to be a variant of Mandarin but uses the Cyrillic alphabet instead of Chinese characters.\n\nAbout one fifth of the people in the world speak some form of Chinese as their native language, making it the most spoken language in the world. It is a tonal language that is related to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Burmese"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tibetan"]]},". Although Japanese and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Korean"]]}," use Chinese written characters and a large number of Chinese loanwords, they are not even in the same language family. Rather they are related in a manner that resembles English having a lot of Romance language-derived loanwords while still being a Germanic language. Also, the unrelated Vietnamese language (which uses a distinctive version of the Latin alphabet) language has borrowed many words from Chinese and at one time used Chinese characters as well.\n\nTravellers headed for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guangdong"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Macau"]]}," may find ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cantonese"]]}," more useful than Mandarin. Those heading for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Taiwan"]]}," or southern ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fujian"]]}," may find the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Minnan"]]}," dialect useful as well.\n\nChinese, like most other Asian languages such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Arabic"]]},", is famous for being difficult to learn. While English speakers would initially have problems with the tones and recognizing the many different characters (Chinese has no alphabet), the grammar is very simple and can be picked up very easily. Most notably, Chinese grammar does not have conjugation, tenses, gender, plurals or other grammatical rules found in other major languages such as English or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["French"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Pronunciation guide"]},"\nThe pronunciation guide below uses ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pinyin Hanyu pinyin"]},", the official romanization of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["People's Republic of China"]]},".
