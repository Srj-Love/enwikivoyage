The caves are mostly water-filled, and are very deep, exceeding 120M depth. The full cave system has not yet been explored.\n\nThe caves are situated within a national park, so you will need to pay an entrance fee. Additionally, if you intend to dive, you need to get the appropriate permit and supervision.\n\nThis is not a dive site for inexperienced divers! Years of extensive training in Technical Diving and Cave Diving are mandatory if you want to dive this site. However, if you have the required expertise this is one of the most spectacular cave diving sites worldwide. Naturally, no diving facilities are available on-site -- you will need to bring all of your own equipment.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["-17.3500"],["30.2000"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Mashonaland"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Chinhoyi"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Africa\/Zimbabwe\/Localities\/Mashonaland_West\/Chinhoyi\/"]]}]
