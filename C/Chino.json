Incorporated as a city in 1910, Chino is a well-established residential and commercial area with beautiful neighborhoods, diverse demographics, irresistible hometown charm and a well-rounded business mix.\n\nChino’s rich agricultural history dates back to the Spanish land grant forming Rancho Santa Ana del Chino. The area specialized in orchard and row crops and was the number one dairy area in the United States. The City’s motto, “Where Everything Grows” originally referred to this agricultural beginning. Today it applies to growth in families, business and the strong sense of community. Commercial and industrial growth has been a significant success in Chino, due in large part to the City’s development friendly philosophy. New businesses are attracted to Chino because it offers modern facilities, reasonable lease rates, competitive labor costs and un-congested access to logistic centers such as Ontario International Airport, UPS, several cross-dock trucking hubs and the BNSF intermodal rail yard in San Bernardino. The 60, 71 and 91 freeways also bound Chino. Additionally, Chino has its own municipal airport which is host to the renowned Chino Air Show each year.\n\nThe City of Chino is within 30 minutes of 21 private and public colleges and universities. Chaffey College opened a satellite center in the city and built a $4 million information technology center in Downtown Chino. Chaffey College also plans to build a 100-acre campus in Chino to serve local communities.\n\nAs the agricultural preserve is developed, Chino’s growth will continue. Our Community Services is dedicated to accommodating the growth in population, while continuing to provide a high level of service that is unsurpassed in the Inland Empire. Chino’s full-service, community oriented Police Department is closely connected to our growing community as well, through its proactive problem solving and community partnerships.\n\nThe City of Chino’s mission statement is” Together we take pride in providing quality, caring service to our community.” City staff is dedicated to this mission statement and maintains their commitment to excellence in customer service. As the City looks to an exciting future, Chino will encourage balanced growth and strive to maintain its cultural heritage and hometown atmosphere.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nChino is located at the intersection of California State Routes 60 and 71 and is less than 10 miles from Interstates 10 and 15.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Ontario International Airport"],["url=http:\/\/www.lawa.org\/welcomeONT.aspx"],["email=ONTairportrep@lawa.org"],["address=1923 East Avion Street, Ontario"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 909 937-2700"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Less than 10 miles from Chino, Ontario International is services by multiple major airlines."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Chino Airport"],["url=http:\/\/www.sbcounty.gov\/chinoairport\/"],["email=admin@airports.sbcounty.gov"],["address=7000 Merrill Ave."],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 909 597-3910"],["tollfree="],["fax=+1 909 597-0274"],["hours="],["price="],["content=The Chino Airport is a public general aviation airport that can handle up to 130,000 lb aircraft its 7,000 foot runway."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Omnitrans"],["url=http:\/\/www.omnitrans.org\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree=+1-800-966-6428"],["fax=+1 909 379-7105"],["hours="],["price="],["content=Omnitrans has four routes that serve Chino and provide connections to surrounding Inland Empire cities."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Planes of Fame Air Museum"],["url=http:\/\/www.planesoffame.org\/"],["email="],["address=7000 Merrill Ave. #17"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Chino Airport"],["phone=+1 909 597-3722"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Su-Fr 10AM-5PM, Sa 9AM-5PM; Closed Thanksgiving & Christmas Day"],["price=12 and up: $11; 5-11: $4; under 5: Free; Seniors (65+) and Veterans: $10; Active duty military, police, and firefighters: Free"],["content=This museum covers the history of flight from an 1896 Chanute Hang Glider through the Space Age.
