Its population has grown rapidly in recent years, and it is currently Wiltshire's third larest town with 40,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe rapid expansion in the last 10 years can be attributed to the development of the South West regional economy as a whole, and specifically to the new housing estates developed in Chippenham such as the recent Cepen Park North and South areas to the west of the town and the earlier Pewsham estate to the east. \n\nThe town lies in the Avon Vale, the broad valley of the River Avon in the low lying claylands of north west Wiltshire. Chippenham is located at  a convenient crossing point of the River Avon, within close proximity of the nearby towns of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Corsham"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Calne"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Melksham"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Malmesbury"]]},". Higher ground lies to the east of the town at the Marlborough Downs, to the north at the Cotswolds and to the south at Salisbury Plain. \n\n",{"type":"====","value":["History"]},"\nThe origins of Chippenham are believed to be from before Roman times, with remains of settlements from this time claimed to be in the wall behind the former magistrates court in the town today. \n\nDuring Saxon times it emerged as an early settlement around 600 AD. There may also have been a royal forest and hunting lodge here that was used by Alfred the Great.  \n\nThe name Chippenham may have been originated from Cyppa's Hamme -  perhaps a Saxon chief called Cyppa, or from the word ce-ap meaning market, and Hamme meaning enclosed by the river or an enclosed water meadow. In its early years this was an area of small family farms, perhaps concentrating on dairy farming and cheese making.\n\nThe name is also claimed to be recorded as Cippanhamm, Cepen, Cheppeham, Shippenham and Chippyngham.  The Domesday Book listed Chippenham as Cepen, with a population of 600-700 people in 1086.  The town received a charter of incorporation in May 1554 by Queen Mary.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Road "]},"\nChippenham town centre is approximately 4 miles from Junction 17 of the M4, linking to Swindon, Reading and London to the East and Bristol and South Wales to the West.

The main station building (on the South side of the station) contains a staffed ticket office, 3 ticket machines and an independent café (serving food, drinks and newspapers). There are car parks on the North and South sides of the station and bicycle parking, a taxi rank and bus stops on the South side. Trains serve both sides of an island platform, accessed by steps from the North or South sides of the station. Step-free access requires assistance from station staff to cross at track level.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Bus"]},"\nThe town is served by a number of bus companies. First Group operates the 231\/232 route to Bath (via Corsham) and 234 to Frome. Stagecoach operates the 55 to Swindon (via Calne and Royal Wootton Bassett). AD Rains, Andybus, APL Travel, Badgerline, Coachstyle and Faresaver operate a large number of services to surrounding towns and villages.
