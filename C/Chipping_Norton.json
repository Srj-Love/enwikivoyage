The surrounding Cotswolds were one of the wealthiest parts of England in the Middle Ages, owing to their production of wool; Chipping Norton was one of the beneficiaries of this trade. Many of the medieval buildings built as a result remain in the town centre, adding to its unique character. Many buildings also date from the 18th century.\nThrough the turmoil of the Middle Ages and the reformation, the industrial revolution right up to the modern association with 'The Chipping Norton Set' Chippy (as it is affectionally known by its residents) has seen its fair share of history, and is an essential place to visit while in the Cotswolds, as well as being an idyllic and peaceful location to stay in while also being close to Oxford and Stratford.\n\nThe town has also been voted one of the UK's top ten Country Towns by the 200,000 readers of Period Living and Traditional Homes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nFor those living close by, there are multiple bus services that meet at Chipping Norton, most notably the S3 (that travels to Oxford, stopping off at Woodstock, Enstone and other places) and the number 50 to Stratford.
