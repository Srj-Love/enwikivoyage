However, Chita is worth a look. A formerly restricted military city, things have developed quite rapidly, if unevenly, over the past few years thanks to the city's position on a main land-trading route with China. Hastily-constructed highrises sit beside ramshackle wooden huts where pensioners trudge to the local water pump even in the -40° mid-winter.\n\nWesterners will often be treated as an object of curiosity as they are rare, but Siberians pride themselves on their hospitality; just a little time spent getting to know any of the locals will be richly rewarded.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\nChita is served by the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Trans-Siberian Railway"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nA service operates to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ulan Ude"]]},", but the frequency depends on the season.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nThere are airlines from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]},"-Ural Airlines and S7 (Siberian) have regular flights. Direct flights to\/from Ekaterinburg are possible. For Moscow, everyone in Chita tends to take a train to Irkutsk and fly from there as to do so is much cheaper. There is also a twice a week hap-hazard service to Beijing via Hailer on Air China, but it is regularly cut short, requiring you to take the train.\n\nThe civilian airport (Kadala) is a few kilometres from the town centre, but rather than taking an expensive taxi to or from the city, hop onto a 'marshrutka' taxibus. In the city, these go from the large concourse between the train station and the cathedral- any marked 'аэропорт' (airport) will go there.\n\nThe airport has very few facilities so bring food and drink if you plan to wait for a while (you will probably have to wait 24 h or so anyway due to delayed flights, fuelling problems and drunken crew).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe public transport system is well developed, with trolleybus journeys at 10 rubles and any taxibus ('marshrutka') journey at 15 rubles (around $0.50 US).\n\nIf you need a taxi, walk beyond the cabs waiting at the station and into a nearby street, the price magically falls with distance from the station.
