[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.comune.chiusi.siena.it\/ Chiusi"]}]}," is a city in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Val di Chiana"]]}," region of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tuscany"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Italy"]]},". It was one of the twelve cities of the Etruscan League. In 391 BC it was besieged by the Gauls which led to its decline as an Etruscan center. It later became a Roman province and in 89 BC its people were given Roman citizenship. In the Middle Ages the city declined, in part because of its support for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Siena"]]}," in its battles with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Florence"]]},". Today, however, it is a flourishing town, with excellent communications.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By road"]},"\n\nChiusi is easily reachable by road.

(short for Chiusi - Chianciano Terme).\n\nThe hilltop portion of Chiusi is 2 km from the station and, since some of the road has no sidewalks, you should take either a bus or taxi if you need to get there.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nIf you are going to or coming from another Tuscan town, see ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tuscany#Get_around"]]}," for more info on bus service.\n\nLocal and interurban buses all seem to stop by the railway station (Chiusi C.T.). You can buy bus tickets at the newsstand within the railway station. The bus stops are to the left of the station doors facing town. The orange local buses stop near those doors while the blue interurban buses are further to left. Keep in mind that a blue interurban bus might serve your local stop as well as an orange local bus. The bus stops serve both directions of travel, so check the destination sign or confirm with the driver.\n\nThe website for Siena Mobilità (http:\/\/sienamobilita.it\/orari.html) has bus schedules (orari) for local routes in Chiusi.
