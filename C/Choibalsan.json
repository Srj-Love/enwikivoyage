It was not a small battle; each side had well over 50,000 troops involved. Nor were they lightly armed; both sides had tanks, aircraft and artillery in play. The Japanese government said at the time that they lost 8,440 killed and 8,766 wounded; other estimates range up to 45,000 killed plus many wounded. One Japanese division was surrounded and overwhelmed; all twenty-odd thousand men were either killed or captured.\n\nThis crushing result greatly affected Japanese strategy. Khalkin Gol effectively settled a faction fight within the Japanese High Command over whether to \"strike north\" — fight only the Russians and aim to expand into resource-rich ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Siberia"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mongolia"]]}," — or \"strike south\" — expand into ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South East Asia"]]},", even though that would require war with both the US and Britain. Before Khalkin Gol, the choice between those strategies was up in the air; afterward the idea of striking south dominated Japanese thinking.\n\nThis made an enormous difference in the course of the war; arguably choosing to strike south was the High Command's greatest blunder. In particular, choosing that course made war with the US inevitable and led quite directly to the attack on ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pearl Harbor"]]},". It is of course impossible to tell, but it is at least conceivable that Japan might have done much better either by persisting with the strike north strategy or by avoiding war with either the Russians or the English-speaking powers, and just settling down to consolidate the enormous gains they had made in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Korea"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China"]]}," in the 1930s.\n\nThe battle may also have affected events further west; Hitler and Stalin signed a non-aggression pact on August 24, just after Khalkin Gol, and Germany invaded Poland on September 1st. Russia and Japan signed a ceasefire on September 15th, and on the 17th Russian troops moved into Poland.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Buriad Hotel"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Located on the square"],["phone=+976 99577427"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["price="],["content=Chadanguud Restaurant is in the lobby, and free wifi in the rooms.
