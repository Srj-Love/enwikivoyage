Some restaurants tweak their recipe for tourists, but if you want a true taste of Thailand street vendors are recommended.  Also very cheap and delicious.\n\nEnterprising food vendors set up clusters of stalls, transforming major street corners, empty lots and alleys into lively food bazaars. Many are mobile, peddling from one area to another on tricycles and motorcycles with fixtures attached, or pushing mini-kitchens around on wooden carts. More modest are hawkers on foot, bearing filled baskets balanced on a wooden yoke upon one shoulder. Along the klong (canals) and waterways, sellers paddle their mini-shops from home to home, offering \"boat noodles,\" curries over rice and an assortment of kanom (sweetmeats and snack foods).\n\nNibbling on street food is an inexpensive way to dine out in Thailand. You can fill yourself at lunch for 30 baht, and spend not much more for a hearty, well-balanced supper of several courses. A refreshing mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack can cost the same or less. But the low price does not indicate a low quality of food. In fact, a lot of street cuisine is very good and rivals some of the more refined gourmet restaurants, and the variety to choose from is immense, including many wonderful treats rarely seen on restaurant menus. Among these are traditional delicacies that are complicated to make and labour intensive that many street vendors are able to give owing to their specialisation in only one or a few items. They become experts at cooking their specialties, after having done it every day for years, and often become well-known and patronised in their area of the city.\n\nBangkokians are known to travel great distances in horrible traffic to particular corners of the city, where an \"aunt\" or \"uncle,\" \"grandma\", or \"grandpa\" makes the best of this or that. Some of the city's most affluent citizens can be seen mingling with the crowds or sitting next to labourers in tattered clothes on rickety stools around well-worn tables. The vendors need no advertising other than their products, as news of good food spreads quickly in a culture with a highly cultivated sense of taste.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Drink "]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["drink"],["name=Buzz Killington's"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=A great place for a pint of Guinness, but be warned this place closes quite early.
