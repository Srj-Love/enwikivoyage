In cities across China, one can find hot pot restaurants, but only Chongqing people can really stand a real hot pot, so if you want authenticity, get it while you can in Chongqing.\n\nWhen ordering hot pot you have a choice between three kinds.  First, the spicy version called red soup (hong tang).  Then there is one without any spices.  This is basically a bone soup, and it is tasty.  To get this, simply ask for \"yuan wei\" or tell them \"wo bu yao la\" which means \"I don't want the spicy stuff!\"  Finally there is a compromise with Yuan Yang Hot Pot (Yuan Yang Huo Guo), which is basically a pot split down the middle with the spicy stuff on one side and the mild on the other.\n\nFor those who like spicy but do not like it too spicy, it is possible to order red soup without the jolt (wei la hong tang).  It is a nice mild experience.\n\nFor those who can not speak Chinese, it would be best to grab a Chinese friend to take you, though be warned, you will have to put up with a lot of drinking, you will be forced to smoke more than you normally would, and some of the things they go slipping into the pot might not be your cup of tea.  You will also have to be aware that you will be fed with a lot of dishes from your Chinese friends because they like to see your bowl is full of food. You might feel a little uncomfortable being fed like a child, but that is the way Chinese people show concern and enthusiasm towards their friends, especially when eating hot pot.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Suggested dishes at nicer restaurants"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Twice cooked spicy pork slices"]}," 回锅肉 (huiguorou) "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Fish slices in sour and spicy pickled vegetable soup"]}," 酸菜鱼 (suancaiyu)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Fried pork fillet slices in sweet and sour sauce"]}," 糖醋里脊(tangculiji)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Steamed fatty pork with preserved vegetables"]}," (shaobai)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Fish flavoured aubergine"]}," 鱼香茄子 (yuxiangqiezi)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Onions and parsleys in spicy mustard"]}," (laohucai)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Fish with tofu"]}," (doufuyu)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Fish flavoured pork shreads"]}," 鱼香肉丝 (yuxiangrousi)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Chinese bouilli"]}," (hongshaorou)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Gongpao Chicken"]}," (gongpaojiding)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Black agaric and pork slice stir-fries"]}," (muerroupian)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Pork\/beef slices in hot and spicy soup"]}," 水煮肉片 (shuizhuroupian) (very spicy)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Numbing and spicy tofu"]}," 麻婆豆腐 (mapodoufu) (spicy)"]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["Suggested dishes at noodle shops"]},"\nAll dishes served in the noodle shops can be either spicy flavoured or plain flavoured.\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Noodle with no toppings"]}," (xiaomian) ¥3.0"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Beef noodle"]}," (niuroumian) ¥6.0"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cold noodle"]}," (liangmian) ¥2.5"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Rice\/soybean pudding slices"]}," (liangfen'r (fer)) ¥2.5"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Szechuan dumplings"]}," (hundun (T'sao sou)) ¥4"]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["Dog meat"]},"\nOverall it is also a good experience to try some dog meat (gourou) in winter.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Western food"]},"\nThere are many \"Western Restaurants\", but it is very difficult to find any real western food in them.
