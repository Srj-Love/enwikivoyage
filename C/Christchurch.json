[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["WV Christchurch banner art gallery.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.christchurch.org.nz\/ Christchurch"]}]}," is the largest city in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South Island"]]}," of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Zealand"]]},". It's the major international entry point for touring the South Island and has enough attractions to be a worthwhile destination in itself.  \n\nChristchurch is in the process of recovering from a large earthquake in February 2011 that severely damaged the city, killed 185 people and displaced many more. Parts of the city may be off limits due to demolition and construction work, but the remainder of the city and region are open for business and the city remains a viable gateway to the rest of the South Island.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nChristchurch was established in 1850 by English settlers. Its English heritage shows in the older buildings, especially in the cultural precinct along Worcester Boulevard (which is open from the River Avon towards the west), where most heritage buildings remain. The River Avon flows through the central city and disrupts the regular rectangular layout of the city streets.\n\nChristchurch is known as the Garden City, a well-deserved name. Looking from a few floors up, one is struck by the number of trees that grow like a forest throughout the suburbs.\n\nAt 04:35 on Saturday, 4 September 2010, the city and region was hit by a magnitude 7.1 earthquake, located 10 km deep and 40 km west of the city centre. Parts of the city were damaged, but there were no fatalities. However, five-and-a-half months later, at 12:51 on Tuesday, 22 February 2011, a magnitude 6.3 aftershock struck 10 km south of the city centre at 5 km deep. Already damaged buildings collapsed, killing 185 people, 115 of which resulted from the six storey Canterbury Television building collapsing and catching fire. Liquefaction severely affected the eastern suburbs, resulting in 10,000 homes having to be abandoned due to land damage (the \"residential red zone\").\n\nInternational tourism, especially foreign-student education for the Asian market, was a growing sector of the Christchurch economy until they were scared away by continuing quakes. The electronics and software development industries remain strong.\n\nChristchurch has lost some of its residents post-earthquake - many have moved out to the Waimakariri and Selwyn Districts north and south of the city respectively, but others have moved to other areas in Canterbury and New Zealand, and some have moved overseas. Christchurch vies with the Wellington conurbation for the position of New Zealand's second largest urban area. (Christchurch is the second largest city, as the Wellington conurbation is made up of four cities.) As of June 2013, Christchurch is home to 375,000 people, with another 50,000 people living within a 45-minute drive of the city.\n\nA very hip scene has developed in some of the suburbs close to the centre, and many 'gapfiller' projects (as part of the earthquake recovery) are stunning. Lonely Planet declared post-earthquake Christchurch as one of the top 10 travel destinations in the world.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=i-Site Visitor Centre"],["url=http:\/\/www.christchurchnz.com\/contact-us\/christchurch-i-site-visitor-centre\/"],["email=info@christchurchnz.com"],["address=Botanic Gardens, Rolleston Ave"],["lat=-43.5313"],["long=172.6273"],["directions=next to Canterbury Museum"],["phone=+64 3 379-9629"],["tollfree=0800 423 783"],["hours=Daily 08:30-17:00"],["content=Free booking service for accommodation, activities and transport."]]},"\n\nFor online information, see the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.christchurchnz.com official Christchurch & Canterbury Tourism site"]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.christchurch-airport.co.nz\/ Christchurch International Airport"]}]}," has international services from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Australia"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cook Islands"]]}," (seasonal winter flights only), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fiji"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Japan"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Singapore"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Thailand"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United Arab Emirates"]]},".

During the trip you’ll see the fields of the Canterbury Plains, followed by spectacular gorges and river valleys of the Waimakariri River. The train then climbs into the Southern Alps before descending through lush beech rain forest to Greymouth.\n\nThe Christchurch railway station is on Troup Drive in Addington, adjacent to the large Tower Junction shopping centre, and has limited facilities.

The central city is contained by the \"four avenues\" - Bealey Ave in the north, Fitzgerald Ave in the east, Deans Ave in the west, and Moorhouse Avenue in the south. Watch out for one-way streets and bus-and-taxi-only intersections in the central city. Currently (May 2014), there are a lot of roadworks around the city as roads and underground services are repaired following the earthquakes, so allow extra time when travelling.\n\nMany people get around on bicycles, and special-purpose bicycle lanes have been recently added to many streets to help promote cycling.\n\nThe city bus service is called ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.metroinfo.co.nz\/ Metro"]},".

Services cover the whole city and areas of interest for a visitor that lie outside the central city, such as Sumner and New Brighton beaches, Lyttelton, the Gondola, etc. In some areas buses may be infrequent, particularly at the weekend, when there may only be one or two buses per hour.\n\nParking in the city uses a pay and display system and costs $2.60\/hour. You can pay with coins, credit card (Visa, MasterCard or AmEx) or with a mobile phone text message (the latter two attract a 50c surcharge) then display the ticket with the expiry time visible on the kerbside dash.

Linwood is one of the lower socio-economic area of Christchurch, and is rougher than some other neighborhoods, but is still considered safe. As in any city, take care late at night, especially on Friday and Saturdays, as levels of intoxication can lead to unwanted attention or unprovoked violence. Avoid dark alleyways and confrontations and, if in doubt, make haste to a populated area and call the police (dial 111).\n\nChristchurch experienced major earthquakes in 2010 and 2011. Aftershocks have been decreasing in number and severity as time passes, but the city is still at risk of earthquakes.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Christchurch Central Police Station"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address=68 St Asaph St"],["lat=-43.5365"],["long=172.6290"],["directions=cnr Antigua St"],["phone=+64 3 363-7400"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Consulates"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["Austria"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Austria"],["alt="],["url="],["email=austrianconsulate.christchurch@xtra.co.nz"],["address=19 Joyce Crescent, Ilam"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["phoneextra=Mobile: +64 21 440 164"],["tollfree="],["fax=+64 3 513-5794"],["hours="],["price="],["content=Honorary Consulate-General - the actual embassy is in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Canberra"]]},", Australia.
