Located along the Bering Strait, Chukotka is home to beautiful tundra scenery and the indigenous Chukchi people, butt of many Russian anecdotes.  Chukotka was until just recently governed by the extravagant Russian Oligarch (and owner of Chelsea football club), Roman Abramovich. Never a province to fit in nicely, Chukotka is also the only region of Russia lying in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Regions"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Anadyr"]]}," — the capital"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bilibino"]]}," — small city on the edge of tundra, site of world's northernmost nuclear plant"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pevek"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Provideniya"]]}," — port, village in north-east Chukotka with population ~2,500-3,000"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Big Diomede"]]}," — easternmost island of Russia"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["El'gygytgyn Lake"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wrangel Island"]]}," — ",{"type":"[[","value":[["UNESCO World Heritage List"],["UNESCO World Heritage Site"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Northern Chukotka.JPG"],["right"],["thumb"],["Desolate wilderness of far northern Chukotka"]]},"\n\nThe Chukotka autonomous district is notable as being the closest point that both Eurasia and Russia gets to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North America"]]}," and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United States"]]},".

It's even possible to swim or even walk across (when the water freezes) but doing so will definitely get you into trouble with local border guards. The easiest way of getting in legally would be by either boat or plane, as long as they stop at one of the established points of entry.
