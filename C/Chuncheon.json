For travelers weary of Seoul's crowds and big city atmosphere, Chuncheon can be an ideal place to spend several days.  The area, surrounded by rivers and hills, offers a variety of relaxing outdoor activities and small town pace.  \n\nThe city is now a popular destination for East Asian tourists as it was featured in the popular Korean drama serial, Winter Sonata.\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nYou can reach the city from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Seoul"]]},"'s ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Incheon International Airport"]]}," via intercity bus.

To reach the Dong Seoul Bus Station, take the Seoul subway system to Gangbyeon Station and leave through exit number 4. The bus station will be visible across the street. These buses take approximately 70 minutes or more depending on traffic. Buses to Chuncheon also depart from Seoul's Sangbong Bus Terminal once every forty minutes, between 05:40 and 21:30.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By metro"]},"\nA new ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Seoul#By subway"],["metro"]]}," line has recently opened from Seoul to Chuncheon. The Gyeongchun Line runs from Sangbong Station in the northeast of Seoul to Namchuncheon and Chuncheon Stations. Metro trains leave every 15 minutes or so, and take a little more than an hour to reach Chuncheon.  It's a brand new subway line, mostly aboveground, and winds through the mountains, alongside the rivers and lakes for which the Gangwon region is famous. A one-way ride costs approximately ₩2,000, depending on which part of Seoul you're coming from.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get Around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nTaxis are the most efficient way of getting around Chuncheon. Taxis are plentiful and you can easily find one within a few minutes if you wait on the sidewalk of most busier streets in the city. You may have trouble catching one if you are on the outskirts of Chuncheon or during rush hour when most are in use. The English word \"Taxi\" is used in Korean, so it's easy to ask someone where one might wait to find a taxi.\n\nThe taxis are identified by a sign mounted on top of the car, but also have a red LED sign with Hangul lettering inside their windshield. If this sign is lit, it signifies that the taxi is available for hire. They turn this sign off when they are already transporting a customer. Stick your arm out to the street as a taxi approaches and they will stop.\n\nTaxis are the best option for short trips through town and are nice when you need door to door service. They are especially helpful when shopping and you have goods to carry with you as you can put them in the trunk or the back seat. Another benefit is when you have multiple people in your group as the fee is the same no matter how many people ride.\n\nMost taxi drivers speak no English, so it is a good idea to have the address of your destination written in Korean to show the taxi driver.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nThough bus numbers are clearly marked and always run the same routes, most are not on any kind of schedule and you could wait 5 minutes or over an hour at a bus stop. They can also become very crowded and you may have to wait for people to get off after several stops before you can acquire a seat. Bus stops are placed throughout the city, but may be a little walk from where you are staying or from your destination. However, buses are more economical when traveling alone or going very far outside the city. Bus fare is typically ₩1,100 per person. Most Koreans who ride the bus regularly have a chipped card they scan when they board. As a visitor, you will need to put the exact cash into a slot in the front when boarding.\n\nWhen you approach the stop you need to get off at, press the red button to the right of the exit door located on the passenger side of the bus half way back. This signals the driver to stop and the side doors will open. Exit quickly as it seems they are often off and running again before you can hit the ground.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Animation Museum"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/animationmuseum.com\/eng\/en01.html"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=South Korea's only Animation Museum is located in Chuncheon and is worth a visit of a few hours or more.
