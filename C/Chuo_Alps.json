For example, you could approach the mountain range from west. There's a hiking trail starting directly from Kuramoto station and it continues west directly up to Utsugidake. The hike from the station up to Kisodono hut is a long one, but doable in one day, if you start early.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Prepare"]},"\n\nDepending on the length of your hike and the accommodation of your choice, you will need at least:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" A decent hiking map (Shobunsha hiking map #40 covers the mountains and costs ¥800)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Proper shoes"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Waterproof clothing"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Enough drinking water"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Hike"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Suggested Itineraries"]},"\n\nAll following itineraries assume that you will overnight in mountain huts, so no sleeping bag or tent is required.

Ropeway whisks you up to 2612m in only 7 minutes. Take the steep route up to Hoken hut and leave your gear either at Hoken hut or Tengu hut. Climb to Kiso-Komagatake and conquer the highest peak of Chuo Alps. Return to the hut for the night.\n\nStart your day early in the morning and descend back to the ropeway station just to climb back up to the ridge. Leave your backpack at Gokuraku daira and climb Hokendake. Alternatively when leaving the hut in the morning you can climb Hokendake directly and descend directly to Gokuraku daira. Hokendake is a really rocky peak, and thus easier to climb without your backpack. From Gokuraku daira to Kisodono hut the route is rather easy to walk and the views are truly breathtaking. You can see the valleys on both sides of the mountain range. Overnight in Kisodono hut.\n\nUtsugidake is a rocky climb from the hut, but the views are again rewarding. Head south to Minami-Komagatake to conquer your second Komagatake. Backtrack to the hut near the top of Utsugidake and rest for the night. There's still a long trek back down. The route dives into lush forest, when you descend almost 2 kilometers in one day.

Return to your backpack and keep heading south for the rewarding hike towards Kisodono hut. \n\nHave a good sleep in the hut and start early in the morning. The hike up to Utsugidake is a tough one, but after that the route through the green forest will be easier. After a long hike down, you finally reach the holiday village of Komagane Kogen.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Dayhike to Hinokiodake"]},"\n\nStart early in the morning and catch a bus for the first ropeway of the morning (leaves 8am). Head up towards Gokuraku daira, and if you are feeling fit, leave you packs there and conquer Hokendake before returning to your backpack. Skip Hokendake if you're doing the hike in late autumn, as there won't be enough light to complete the whole course. The views on your way towards Hinokiodake are gorgeous. Catch your breath on the top of Hinokiodake before you turn to Hinokio route and continue your way back down. Soon you will enter a lush forest, which engulfs you during your final legs down the hill. When you will reach the road again, your altitude is 1,160 meters - that is, about 1,700 meters down in few hours! If you're continuing to Komagane with a bus, the bus stop is a few hundred meters down the road.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Dayhike to Sannosawadake"]},"\n\nThis leisurely route includes going both up and down with the ropeway. From the Sensojiki ropeway station hike up to Gokuraku daira, turn towards Hokendake, but instead of going up there, turn left towards Sannosawadake. The hike from Gokuraku daira should be about two hours and the trail goes along the ridge, where you have good view to both sides. Backtrack along the same route. If you have time, you could go via the rocky path to Hokendake and descend down to the ropeway station using another route.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nThe most important thing is to keep ",{"type":"'''","value":["enough water"]}," in your pack and drink constantly.

You can also fill your water bottles in mountain huts.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nThere are several mountain huts (山小屋 ",{"type":"''","value":["yamagoya"]},") along the route, where you can sleep for the night. Overnight with 2 spartan meals costs about ¥7000. Without meals the price is typically around ¥5000.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nHiking in the Chuo Alps is not dangerous and many of the routes are of average difficulty. However, there are certain things that you should keep in mind. It's always better to hike with someone. For example, if you strain your ankle, you will have a friend to take care of you. Although if you are hiking during July or August, there will very likely be other people around as well. Tell someone about your planned route. If you're staying in mountain huts, let the people there know where you are heading next.\n\nBe sure that you have the necessary equipment, enough drinking water and a proper map with you. The weather can change very rapidly and it can get really cold and windy up in the mountains, even in summer. Waterproof clothing is advised. It is very unlikely that you will encounter any dangerous animals during the hike - there are several monkeys though, but they tend to avoid close contact with people. Keep in mind that mobile phone coverage and especially the WCDMA network coverage is restricted in the mountains.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Nagano (prefecture)"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["no Wikipedia link"]]}]
