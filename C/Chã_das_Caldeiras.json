The villages of Portela and Bangaeria are effectively joined as they sprawl for a kilometer or two on the main road that crosses the crater.\n\nThe villagers live from the agriculture in the rich volcanic soil of the crater. Grapes are used to made the excellent Fogo wine which must be tried. Apples, pears, peaches and figs are also grown.\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nAlguers leave from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["São Filipe"]]},".

The pickup leaves from his downtown office around 11:00 for the 2-hour journey (500$).\n\nAluguers are around the same price but take around three hours due to frequent stops.\n\nGetting back to São Filipe is similar with Patrick's pickup leaving at 08:30.

Despite the imposing slopes, the climb is possible for anyone of moderate fitness who doesn't mind a bit a rock scrambling.\n\nA sturdy pair of sneakers is essential - no sandals. High-top hiking shoes or even walking sticks are not required but might be appreciated. Don't forget sunscreen and water.\n\nIdeally you will want to spend two nights in Chã das Caldeiras. Take a short walk in the afternoon and arrange a guide for the trip up the peak the following day.\n\nGuides charge around 4500$ for a group, so you might want to ask around to share the cost.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Pousada Pedra Brabo"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=is the finest place to eat and is open to non-residents."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" There is a restaurant next to the tourist office which serves good fare."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["drink"],["name=Casa Ramires"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=On the bend in the road near the tourist office"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=This mini-market serves drinks in the evenings and is the place to hear local music.
