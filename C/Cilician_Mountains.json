For history lovers, it offers hundreds of castles, city ruins, temples, inns, and artifacts dating back to Roman, Biblical, Crusade, Seljuq, and Ottoman times. For nature lovers, it may mean mountains, mountains, and again mountains covered with pine forests. For green warriors, it holds the last shelters for endangered Mediterranean monk seals (",{"type":"''","value":["Monachus monachus"]},") and Mediterranean sea turtles (",{"type":"''","value":["Caretta caretta"]},"). For sea&sun seekers, it has hundreds of miles of beaches, both sandy and pebbled, spared from pollution, lying under perhaps one of the sunniest skies of Turkey and also of Europe.\n\nDespite its close proximity to Turkey’s main touristic areas, still “travelling” (i.e., being a “traveller”) is the norm in much of the region (as opposed to “tourism”, i.e., being a “tourist”). If you want to have a cup of tea, then you should head for local coffeehouse, not a touristical\/fancy\/European-looking café. If you’ll sleep in somewhere, then it would (most likely) be a guesthouse where other regional guests are staying at, not an “all-inclusive” holiday resort as a part of a package tour. This situation has its advantages: people are more friendly, and prices are lower.\n\nThe region—especially the western and southern parts—is mostly rugged and wooded, and is dominated by Taurus Mountains with very little (or no) flatland between mountain slopes and the shoreline. Quite surprisingly, this mountainous area—one of the remotest and most beautiful along Turkish Mediterranean coast—has one of the least population densities anywhere in maritime Turkey and distances between towns are huge. From ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Silifke"]]}," eastwards, high mountains retreat a little inland, but the coastline still keeps its hilly topography. \n\nIn ancient times, this region was called ",{"type":"''","value":["Cilicia Trachea"]},", i.e. \"rough Cilicia\" or more precisely \"mountanious Cilicia\", as opposed to ",{"type":"''","value":["Cilicia Pedias"]},", i.e. \"",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cilician Plains"],["flat Cilicia"]]},"\" lying to the east of the region.
