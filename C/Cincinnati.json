Its culture is a mixture of the Northeast, Old South, Midwest,  and Appalachia blended with a strong German-Catholic heritage. It was one of the United States' early boomtowns, and the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood is the largest National Historic District in the country. Today, it's part of a fast-growing metro area, and home to a remarkable blend of industry and architecture. Downtown Cincinnati is surrounded by picturesque foothills that add a beautiful backdrop to the Queen City and its legendary skyline – celebrated in the opening credits of television show ",{"type":"''","value":["WKRP in Cincinnati"]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Cincinnati skyline from Mount Echo Park.JPG"],["thumb"],["350px"],["View of Downtown Cincinnati and surrounding hills from Mt. Echo Park in East Price Hill"]]},"\n\nFormerly known as Losantiville, the city was renamed Cincinnati by the first governor of the Northwest Territory, Arthur St. Clair, in honor of the Society of the Cincinnati, a society named after Roman consul Cincinnatus and founded at the end of the Revolutionary War. Many members of the Society were prominent men in the early years of the United States.\n\nThe city's early economy was based on the pork industry, and this was celebrated in the summer of 2000 with the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Big Pig Gig"]},", during which large flying pig statues took up residence along the city's main thoroughfares. Many of these pig statues later found homes downtown in offices, parks and even private residences.  The Miami and Erie canal was completed in the 1840s, and was used to transport hogs and butchered pork products to Cincinnati from much of western Ohio.\n\nDuring this time period massive waves of Germans settled into the city populating neighborhoods which at their height in the late 1800s were some of  the most densely populated outside of New York City.  These German immigrants built a culture based on beer gardens, beer brewing, dance and music halls giving Cincinnati a very distinct and vibrant local culture.  Unfortunately very little remains from this era due to both World War I anti-German backlash and the prohibition of alcohol in 1920. Lately, with the beginnings of revitalization of the Downtown Basin neighborhoods, there has been a renewed interest in this heritage and some of it can be seen to this day in faded German signs on densely built ornate Victorian buildings in Over-The-Rhine,  a high per-capita number of bars, and the celebration of large German festivals such Bockfest, Mayfest, and the largest Oktoberfest celebration in the United States.\n\nCincinnati also has a charming riverboat heritage that dates back to the days when large, steam and paddle-wheel driven vessels were used to transport locally produced pork products. In recognition of this tradition, the city plays host to the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Tall Stacks Festival"]}," once every few years, during which time the river front is transformed into a mass of color, with river boats of all shapes and sizes jostling for positions along the river banks.  Baseball is another Cincinnati tradition, and the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cincinnati Reds"]}," were the first professional baseball team in the United States; in deference to that, Opening Day is always a home game for the Reds, held at Great American Ball Park.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["\"Please?\""],["No, Cincinnatians are not correcting your manners.

In World Wars I and II, Cincinnati's local machine tool companies, such as LeBlond (now Makino) and the Cincinnati Screw and Tap Company (now Milacron), played an important role, providing what is commonly considered the best machine tool technology in the world for its time.\n\nRecently, Cincinnati has seen some large scale revitalization projects, such as the construction of Great American Ball Park and Paul Brown Stadium, the reconstruction of Fountain Square, the construction of the first phase of the Banks neighborhood (which will eventually include, a hotel, shopping, houses and entertainment) and the beginnings of restoration of Over-The-Rhine through the \"Gateway Quarter\".  This has given the central areas of Cincinnati a vitality that hadn't been around for decades, though it is still very much a work in progress with other projects like a Streetcar line connecting Downtown to the University on the horizon.\n\nThis progress did not come easy.  For instance, county officials, city government, and area residents were flabbergasted that large scale projects like \"The Banks\" were undeveloped for over 10 years while the smaller cities of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Newport (Kentucky)"],["Newport"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Covington (Kentucky)"],["Covington"]]},", across the Ohio River, continued to develop their riverfronts and draw visitors away from Cincinnati.

Stops include Fountain Square, The Banks, Newport on the Levee, and Roebling Point.

Prices for each zone are respectively: $1.75, $2.65, and $3.  Metro has several routes, most notably routes 71X and 72 (Both $4.25), which charge a slightly higher fare than normal.  Transferring between one bus route to another on the Metro system requires another 50 cents for a transfer ticket and passengers transferring from a Zone 2 or 3 bus to another Zone 2 or 3 bus should ensure that the bus driver hole punches the appropriate zone on the transfer ticket. Otherwise a further payment equivalent to the difference between the zone you're traveling to, if your trip ends in zone 2 or 3, and zone 1 fare must be paid.\n\nTANK (Transit Authority of Northern Kentucky) buses charge a flat rate of $1.50 for all adults, 75¢ for seniors, $1; for students.

Taxi's are pretty easy to come by downtown and in OTR, but are much harder outside of these key neighborhoods.  Taxi costs are all over the place as rates aren't set by the city or the state, if you pick the wrong company, you could pay 50% more than another company!  Inquire with the taxi companies regarding rates, see below for contact information.\n\nTaxi companies in Cincinnati include:\n",{"type":"*","value":["Towne Taxi, +1 513 761-7700 "]},{"type":"*","value":["Yellow Cab, +1 513 742-3075 "]},{"type":"*","value":["United Cab Company, +1 513 251-1155"]},"\nLyft and UberX are also available in Cincinnati for those who have a smartphone and can use their respective apps - the rates are usually cheaper than normal taxis.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By foot"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Germania-Building-front.jpg"],["thumbnail"],["Some of the lovely historic architecture one could miss unless walking!"]]},"\nSome of the older neighborhoods in Cincinnati are quite walkable, with the Clifton Gaslight District (Ludlow), Over-The-Rhine, Mt. Adams, and Downtown being amongst the easiest to travel by foot.  Due to massive depopulation of what were formerly neighborhoods with densities approaching that of New York City, (like Over-The-Rhine and the West End), Cincinnati is way more car oriented these days with most destinations being too spread out to walk to.  However, many of these districts were built to pedestrian scale and are worth a stroll so long as one exercises caution (see the stay safe section). A visitor from a larger East Coast city may expect neighborhoods of similar scale and architectural composition to be filled with people, but instead oftentimes they are full of abandonment and the problems that come along with it.  However, places like Mt. Adams, Downtown, or Clifton around the Gaslight District don't have these problems are well worth exploring by foot, park your car outside of the neighborhood and walk right in.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Skywalk"]},"\nCincinnati's Downtown has a Skywalk path. The Skywalk is an indoor, above-ground path through the streets of Cincinnati's Downtown. The Skywalk is free, and only used by pedestrians. Urban analysts hired by the city and downtown business leaders want to tear down chunks of the elevated passageways. Although most of the paths have been torn down, some of the Skywalk still exists, allowing travelers to continue to beat the weather.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Hillside Steps"]},"\nCincinnati has over 400 hillside steps for the adventurous traveler to explore. These steps were built before people had cars to facilitate easy transportation by foot up and down the steep hillsides that populate the city.  Some steps are very famous such as the Mt. Adams Steps up to the Holy Cross Immaculata Church (described under the To See section) while others underused and\/or are falling apart. Still more, like St. Gregory's steps in Mt. Adams, are hidden gems, guiding a traveler through a hidden forest oasis in a densely populated neighborhood. Be cautious when traveling on these steps, as they sometimes go through remote areas and while the neighborhood on one end of the steps could be safe, the neighborhood at the other could be crime infested.  The city has a somewhat difficult to decipher but extensive guide of the locations and conditions of the steps here ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cincinnati-oh.gov\/transeng\/pages\/-7085-\/"]},".\n\nAn even better guide to the city's steps is here ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.communitywalk.com\/cincinnatisteps"]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bicycle"]},"\n\nCincinnati has a long way to go before it reaches the level of Portland or Chicago in terms of bicycle culture and accessibility. However, the city has lately been installing bicycle lanes and even on street bicycle parking in some key neighborhoods like Over-the-Rhine and Northside.  Biking in Cincinnati is challenging, and is recommended for ",{"type":"'''","value":["experienced urban riders"]},", as the terrain is quite hilly producing often curvy roads that can go up or down very steep grades.\n\nDespite the challenge, the narrow roads and urban setting are well suited for using a bicycle. Residential neighborhoods along the river near downtown (Roebling Point, The Banks, Over-the-Rhine, Newport Historic East Row) are relatively flat and quiet.  The city posts a color coded map\/guide to recommended bicycle routes and facilities as well as information regarding its bicycle policies and projects here ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cincinnati-oh.gov\/bikes\/"]},". All buses have bike mounts on the front if you get tired or don't want to pedal up a hill.\n\nYou can rent bikes from the newly opened ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/bikeandpark.com\/city\/cincinnati\/locations Cincinnnati Bike Center"]}]}," at Smale Riverfront Park or from ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.wheelfunrentals.com\/listlocations\/90 Wheel of Fun Rentals"]}]}," by Sawyer Point on the Riverfront downtown (",{"type":"''","value":["charges hourly, including tandem bikes"]},").\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nFor getting quickly and conveniently to most places in Cincinnati, you will need a car.  Be aware that there is a street grid only in Downtown and its surrounding neighborhoods.  Outside of those parts of the city navigation can be tough, with street names changing constantly and unintuitive routes being the norm.  It can be particularly tough getting up to Mt. Adams. If you don't go down the right series of one-way streets, you could wind up getting flung out to one of the surrounding neighborhoods or Eden Park. There are a few signs directing drivers through the neighborhood, but they are easily missed.  A good roadmap or GPS system is highly recommended if you plan on driving around.\n\nMany roads are very narrow and very hilly reflecting the age of most of Cincinnati, which was built well before the automobile was the mainstay of transportation.  Some streets will feel like country roads with the occasional urban house\/apartment built where the terrain can support it.  Other roads like the aptly named Straight Street quite literally go straight down a hill at a very steep grade.  Be careful when driving in inclement weather and remember that when parking on a steep slope, point your tires towards the curb (if downhill) or away from the curb (if uphill) and use your emergency brake.\n\nI-75 is to be avoided around rush hours at all costs. While traffic isn't as heavy as one would encounter in much larger cities, it can still be quite formidable. The large amount of truck traffic, combined short ramps and many blind corners create a traffic nightmare.  If you can, take the less traveled (though still somewhat congested) I-71.\n\nParking is generally cheap and plentiful in Cincinnati. The few trouble spots are around the University in the Clifton\/Corryville areas (Uptown), Downtown, and Mt. Adams.  When parking in Mt. Adams, be aware of parking restrictions by reading the signs. There are far more parking restrictions here than anywhere else in the city, due to the narrow streets and dense population of that neighborhood.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Carew Tower Cincinnati.JPG"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Carew Tower, Cincinnati's 2nd tallest building."]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Carew Tower & Observation Deck"],["url=http:\/\/www.cincinnati.com\/visitorsguide\/stories\/022701_carewtower.html"],["email="],["address=441 Vine St"],["lat=39.100840"],["long=-84.513236"],["directions=Downtown"],["phone=+1 513 579-9735"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=M-Sa 10AM-5:30PM, Su 11AM-5PM"],["price=Adults $2, Children $1"],["content= The Carew Tower served as the basis for the design of the later Empire State Building.

The most common crime [downtown] is theft, which includes shoplifting but not muggings, and the most likely crime you'll suffer is having your car broken into.\" Therefore, it's safer to park your car in a monitored lot than on the street.
