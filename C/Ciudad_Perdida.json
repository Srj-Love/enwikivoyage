Just be aware that remaining dripping wet for extended periods in an already humid environment can lead to fungal infections and just generally smelling bad, so it is good to dry off completely after swimming, showering, etc.\n\nBring at least one full bottle of bug spray and at least one pair of long pants and one long-sleeved shirt to protect yourself from the swarms during rest periods and breaks. Mosquitoes and biting flies are a constant nuisance, especially when you are resting or stopped at camp - when you are actually hiking and moving the problem is much less severe. Bring more bugspray than sunscreen, as often you will be hiking with substantial tree cover.\n\nFor each piece of electronic equipment you choose to bring (cell phone, camera, iPod, etc.), purchase a waterproof, crushproof, drybox.\n\nFootwear - an absolute must is a pair of quick-drying, teva-like sandals for river crossings. The actual hiking can be done with hiking boots, hiking shoes, or tennis shoes. For most people hiking boots are advisable as the terrain can be extremely rocky, muddy, and most important - slippery. Probably the most important consideration is to bring a pair of shoes that have a strong grip and are well broken in.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Ciudad Perdida"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["11.037997"],["-73.925192"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Magdalena Department"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usablepark"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Ciudad perdida"]]}]
