It was already important 3000 years ago, protected from invaders by its high position and surrounding stream and cliffs. The Romans defeated the Falisci in 396 BC and in again in 241 BC after a revolt by the locals who were then required to build a new, less defensible, city about 5 km away,. This is known as Falerii Novi (see Get Out). \nThe original city was repopulated in the early Middle Ages because it offered greater protection, and the new name of Civita Castellana was first mentioned in 994. In the following centuries the city was a flourishing independent commune. \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Civilta2.JPG"],["thumb"],["right"],["200px"],["The cathedral floor"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nCivita Castellana is located about 60 kilometers north of Rome. By car from Rome’s ring road, the GRA, take the SS2bis (known as the ",{"type":"''","value":["Cassia bis or"]}," the ",{"type":"''","value":["Cassia Veientana"]},") until Gabelletta and then the SS311 in the direction of Nepi. Civita Castellana can also be reached by the Italian state railway from Tuburtina\/Trastevere stations (",{"type":"'''","value":["not"]}," Stazione Termini) to Civita Castellana\/Magliano Sabina. Locally this station is known as Borghetto for the frazione of Civita in which it is located. The local bus company, Vitertur, operates a service for commuters to the center of Civita. Tickets can be bought in either of the bars at that station for the sum of one euro. The MetRoma service from Piazzale Flaminio is limited to peak commuter travel hours and takes about 90 minutes to reach CC. The last half hour is stunningly beautiful but the trip overall is longer than it should be if the track were doubled or if the line had not been made to take the scenic route around Monte Soratte100 years ago. The local bus company, COTRAL, connects Saxa Rubra station to CC via the Flaminia and it is also sometimes a painfully slow service. Daily tickets cost €9 return (",{"type":"''","value":["biglietto giornaliero"]},") and can be used on the state railway, Cotral bus and the Metroma service (as well as all over in Rome if originating from CC).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Cathedral of S.

Uniquely, this duomo has a Cosmatesque facade (signed and dated in gold mosaic tiles, dated 1210) as well as Cosmatesque floor mosaic work. These patterns were created in the Middle Ages from thin slices cut from colored marble and columns left in the ancient ruins. The name derives from a Roman family, the Cosmati, who did this sort of work. Similar Cosmati floors can be found in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rome"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Anagni"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Spoleto"]]},". The high altar is fashioned from  a sarcophagus of the 3rd or 4th century. The ancient crypt is fascinating and well worth visiting. Sadly the interior was redone in the 1740s but retains  many of its antique marble columns. The organ is the same one on which the young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart played. Outside, the effect of the beautiful portico, dating back to 1210, is somewhat spoiled by the modern fence that protects it. To see what the original interior would have looked like, visit the Basilica at nearby Castel Sant'Elia."]},{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Civita3.JPG"],["thumb"],["right"],["250px"],["The cathedral's crypt"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["The fortress"]}," (Forte Sangallo).

It now houses the local Etruscan Museum (though most of the Faliscan and Etruscan finds from the area enrich the collection of the Villa Giulia in Rome.

Civita is a superb base from which to explore Northern Lazio (by car).It was also one of the first locations that drew outdoor painters in the 18th century, and many of the views they painted are still unspoiled today. The local building material is mainly tufa, and the region is full of tufa cliffs and gorges, Etruscan burials and wonderful small towns.\n\nMost amenities are within easy waking distance here in the old center of this ancient town, historically the center of the Faliscan empire. The Faliscans were contemporaries of the Etruscans and Civita finally fell to the Romans in 241 BC. It is built on a naturally defensible bluff. Civita also has a wonderful Antonio da Sangallo fortress built around 1500, which was a Papal palace and then a prison, and now a museum displaying Faliscan and Roman relics, where there is a free music festival every July. There are wonderful things to see all over the region: Viterbo has one of the best preserved medieval centers in Europe and the Terme dei Papi bath complex, Sutri, Calcata, Nepi, the Via Amerina (an ancient road lined with burial chambers carved into the rock), Monster Park at Bomarzo, Villa Farnese at Caprarola, Villa Lante at Bagnaia, nearby Castel Sant'Elia with its 12th century Basilica and Sanctuary, the beech forest - La Faggeta - near Soriano, where the Romans came to capture wild animals for the sport in the Colisseum, also Amelia, Calvi, Otricoli, Lago di Bracciano, Lago di Vico, Faleri Novi, Oriolo Romano, Vignanello, Vasanello, San Martino al Cimino, Bolsena, Montefiascone, Tuscania, Civita di Bagnoregio. So many wonderful and uncrowded places to visit. It's a wonderful area to be based to see the wonderful Renaissance gardens of Lazio as well (check out: www.secretgardensitaly.com for itineraries), and is near enough to the main A1 highway to allow day-trips to such places as Perugia, Orvieto, Todi, among others. Good coffee, food and wine and many festivals celebrating local food and traditions all summer long. Tuesdays and Fridays there is a smaller fresh fruit\/vegetable market in the old part of town, and on Saturday mornings there is the big fresh market in the new part of town.\n\nThe best way to explore the area surrounding the town is on foot. There are superb trails down to and along the many rivers that have always defined this area. Descending into the surrounding woods is truly like stepping into the countryside as it was 3000 years ago. Local group Argilla (http:\/\/www.turismocivitacastellana.it) organizes excursions along these trails regularly, in cooperation with the Federtrek, for individuals and groups.

There are extensive walls, considered to be excellent examples of Etruscan\/Roman city walls.  Built out of tufo rock, they are about 2 km long. S. Maria of Falerii was built around the 12th Century. The church has been restored and can be visited weekends. The adventurous can reach Faleri Novi by following the Via Amerina from just outside Civita (leaving a car at the parking lot of the Quercia restaurant) and proceeding through the countryside.

Be aware that Calcata is mainly closed during the week - shops and restaurants are generally only open on Saturdays and Sundays. Be prepared to park in the big lot in Calcata Nuova and walk into the tiny town below - parking is difficult weekends. Just beyond Calacata are the falls of Monte Gelato near Mazzano and a hiking trail up to the ancient settlement at Narce. Calcata is connected to Civita Castellana by a trail through the Parco del Treja - a hike of approximately 12 kilometers, challenging in places, but beautiful, that follows the river bed, emerging along the Via Flaminia a few km outside of Civita."]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Civita Castellana"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["42.2833"],["12.4000"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Viterbo (province)"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]}]
