",{"type":"'''","value":["Civita"]}," is on a hill accessible only by a long stone walkway that begins at the end of the road from neighboring ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bagnoregio"]},". Once, Civita was the larger community and Bagnoregio the satellite. Today, Civita has only about 14 year-round residents, so few that Civita is nicknamed \"the Dead City.\" Many of the buildings in Civita are being purchased by rich Italians who come here for vacation. However the town suffers constant erosion of its volcanic rock into the valley below.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:20090414-Cività-di-Bagnoregio.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["300px"],["Bagnoregio and the walkway to reach it"]]},"\n\nCivita is a charming medieval city, almost utterly untouched by the Renaissance. (The façade of the church was remodeled during the Renaissance, but the city is otherwise entirely medieval.) Despite its nickname, during the tourist season, Civita bustles with day trippers.\n\nThe long bridge into Civita is steep—and it gets steeper as it rises. This is a challenging climb for anyone not in particularly good shape.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By Bus"]}," To get to Civita, you will need first to get to Bagnoregio. There is a bus from Orvieto; the bus is run by Cotral S.p.A. and cost €2 each way. It leaves from Orvieto's Piazza Cahen, which is just outside the top of the funicular. Download the latest time-table from ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cotralspa.it\/PDF_Orari_Comune\/Orvieto.pdf Cotral's Website"]},". You can buy tickets in the station bar, or on board the bus (try to have exact change).\n\nAs of 2011 the following timetable applies:\n\n",{"type":"{|","value":[["border=\"1\""],["|+ Orvieto to Bagnoregio"],["! scope=\"row\" | Leave Orvieto"],["| 6:20 || 7:25% || 7:50% || 12:45 ||13:55% || 15:45 || 17:40% || 18:20"],["|-"],["! scope=\"row\" | Arrive Bagnoregio"],["| 7:15 || 8:10% || 8:40% || 13:40 || 14:50% || 16:35 || 18:53% || 19:22"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{|","value":[["border=\"1\""],["|+ Bagnoregio to Orvieto"],["! scope=\"row\" | Leave Bagnoregio"],["| 5:30 || 6:35% || 6:50 || 9:55 || 10:10% || 10:25+ || 13:00 || 13:35% || 14:25 || 17:25"],["|-"],["! scope=\"row\" | Arrive Orvieto"],["| 6:15 || 7:15% || 7:45 || 10:45 || 11:15% || 11:25+ || 13:45 || 14:25% || 15:20 || 18:20"]]},"\n\n% = bus only runs during school (Sept to April)\n\n+ = bus runs only on non-school days\n\nFrom where the bus drops you off there is a minibus that goes up to Civita. Alternatively you can walk, it only takes about 15 - 20 mins, so if you just missed a minibus it is almost certainly faster to walk. Simply walk up the hill and follow the main road, if you have any doubt ask at the gas station or the tourist information centre near the gas station if open.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By Car"]}," The simplest way to get to Bagnoregio from Orvieto is to get on the autostrada and follow the signs to Lubriano and Bagnoregio. A more scenic route takes 20 minutes longer. From the freeway, pass under hill-capping Orvieto, with signs to Lago di Bolsena and Viale I Maggio on your right, and take the first left to Bagnoregio, winding through Canale and great Orvieto views.\n\nOnce you get into Bagnoregio, you can park either at the bus lot at the edge of town or at the base of the stone walkway. (Follow the yellow signs to Civita to reach the parking lot.) There is a parking charge of €1 an hour, which you can pay at the shop or the restaurant. Parking may be free on weekdays or off season when there's no attendant.\n\nAlternately, you can walk from Bagnoregio to the Civita bridge (it takes about 20 minutes) or take a €1 yellow minibus (pay the driver) from the gas station to the base of the walkway. You can ascend to Civita only on foot, but taking the bus from Bagnoregio will cut your walking distance in half. One or two buses leave each hour, starting at 7:38AM Monday to Saturday and 8:53AM Sunday. The last bus leaves at 6:24PM\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Romanesque Arch"]}," At the entrance to Civita, this arch was cut by the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Etruscans"]}," 2,500 years ago."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Renaissance Palace remains"]}," All that remains of an old palace is the façade, the rest collapsed into the canyon from erosion of the hill Civita sits on."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Piazza"]}," The town's only public phone is at the piazza, the site of donkey races on the first Sunday in June and the second Sunday of September.
