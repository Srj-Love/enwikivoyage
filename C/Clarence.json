He was followed a few years later by Joseph Ellicott, a Holland Land Company agent who operated a branch office near the Ransom homestead beginning in 1801. Ellicott's presence encouraged more settlers to buy land in the vicinity; in 1808, the Town of Clarence—named after Prince William, Duke of Clarence, third son of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United Kingdom"],["Great Britain"]]},"'s King George III—was founded as one of the three original towns of Niagara County, of which Erie County was a part until 1821. \n\nAt the time of its foundation, Clarence—whose borders then also included all the land that today comprises Buffalo, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tonawanda"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Grand Island (New York)"],["Grand Island"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amherst (New York)"],["Amherst"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cheektowaga"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lancaster (New York)"],["Lancaster"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["West Seneca"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lackawanna"]]},", Newstead, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alden"]]},", and part of the towns of Elma and Marilla—had a population of perhaps 100 or 150 residents. Though Clarence's land area steadily decreased over the ensuing decades as new towns were cleaved off of it, its population increased steadily, particularly beginning in the second quarter of the 19th Century as a considerable number of Germans settled on the fertile, loamy soil of Clarence. The industriousness of these Germans, part of a wave of emigration from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Germany"]]}," to North America that peaked around the 1840s, eventually made Clarence one of the most prosperous towns in the county.
