From New Albany, Spring St. leads to Browns Station Way, which runs through Clarksville.

Living in the waters were countless corals, sponges, mollusks, and now extinct brachiopods and echinoderms. Over time, as these animals died, they became buried in layers and layers of sediment that helped to fossilize them. As the Ice Age glaciers retreated, the numerous fossil beds became visible, seen most heavily in the park location, but throughout the Ohio River Valley. \n\nAmerican history is vast in the park, and is discussed at the visitors center.  George Rogers Clark established the first English-speaking settlement in the Northwest Territory in a part of the park, in 1778. Aaron Burr trained military troops in the area for a proposed Mexican invasion. William Clark and Meriweather Lewis set off on their landmark journey from the area. \n\nThe Falls consist of a series of rapids which were formed by the water flowing over an island of fossil beds. Now, only a small set of rapids are visible, due to the building of the McAlpine Dam in the 1920s.  More then 600 species of fossils are found within the park, including hundreds of brand new species. \n\nOver 270 species of birds (herons, egrets, waterfowl, osprey, falcons and the occasional bald eagle) and 125 species of fish (including the primitive paddlefish, striped bass, sauger, white bass, crappie and catfish) are found in the park. \n\n\n\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Festivals and Events"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"''","value":["late April"]}," ",{"type":"'''","value":["Thunder Over Louisville"]}," Clarksville and Jeffersonville.
