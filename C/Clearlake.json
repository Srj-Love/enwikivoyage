Come and enjoy.\n\nIf you are ever in Clealake,Calif, you have to stop by the Main Street Cafe. This is one of our favorate resturants in town.

Main Stree Cafe is located right across the lake, on Lakeshore Blvd.\n\nThere are two restaurants in Clearlake that I recommend.  One is The Main Street Bar and Grill which serves a variety of food and the service is friendly.  The prices are reasonable and the food is very good.\nThere is also The Happy Garden Chinese restaurant located in Clearlake Oaks.\nThe prices are reasonable and the food is first rate!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nMain Street Bar and Grill is a wonderful place to eat.
