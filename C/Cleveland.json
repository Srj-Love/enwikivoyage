Throughout the twentieth century, the City of Cleveland proper was ranked as one of the 10 largest cities in the U.S. (from 1890 until 1970 per US Census Bureau statistics). Like most U.S. cities, Cleveland proper began to lose population to suburban areas in the 1960s and 1970s.  However, in the mid-1980s, Cleveland earned the nickname the \"Comeback City\" as the urban core experienced a dramatic revitalization process that continues today.

Like other cities in the so-called \"rust belt\", Cleveland has endured growing pains as it makes its transition from a manufacturing-based economy.

There are almost no one-way streets, because the city was planned to have \"European Avenues\" (which resulted in the foresight to make them broad enough for vehicular transportation that couldn't have been imagined in the late 1700s). Traffic is generally not a problem relative to other major U.S. metro areas. Throughout the downtown area, purple signs direct visitors to let you know where you are and what district you are in. The streets that run north-south are numbered, except for Ontario Street (the north-south street bisecting Public Square). Numbered Streets are named as \"West\", west of Ontario and \"East\", east of Ontario. (Broadview Road becomes the primary geographic boundary between 'East' and 'West' addresses to the south of the city.) The major east-west streets are generally named as \"Avenues\".\n\nFinding an address is simple as well.  Numbers on north-south streets increase as you head south from Lake Erie, numbers on east-west streets increase as you head away from downtown and coincide with the numbered streets (i.e. 6500 Detroit Ave is located at the corner of Detroit Ave and W 65th St).  Odd addresses on north-south streets are for buildings on the east side of the street, and even addresses are on the west side; on the west side of Cleveland, odd addresses on east-west streets are located on the south side of the street, while even addresses are on the north side—the reverse is true for east-west streets on the east side of Cleveland.  This addressing scheme continues into most of the suburbs (some exceptions include Berea and Bedford) and even most cities and townships in Lake and Lorain Counties.\n\nMost of the city is laid out in grids and has very clear signage enabling you to easily know where you are.  Throughout the area, signs are thoroughly placed to indicate the route to the nearest major freeway, making the city extremely visitor-friendly!\n\nCleveland rush hours (7AM-9AM; 4PM-6:30PM in the afternoon) are light compared to many metropolitan areas, with traffic still moving near posted speed limits throughout most of the area.

Nevertheless, keep a watchful eye on your surroundings in the evening when vast parts of the neighborhood are deserted.  Eastern inner-ring suburbs such as Cleveland Heights, University Heights, Beachwood and Shaker Heights are all very safe.\n\nA good rule of thumb is - once an East Side suburban \"Road\" becomes an Inner City \"Avenue\", turn around and get directions to Euclid, Chester or Carnegie Avenues. Example: Cedar Road in the East Side Suburbs (where it becomes the \"Fashion District\") is a really nice corridor, but once it becomes Cedar Avenue in the City of Cleveland proper, you should pick one of the above mentioned roads that run parallel to its north. Similarly, Chagrin Boulevard (which connects the upscale communities of Shaker Heights, Beachwood (including Cleveland's \"Restaurant Row\" and the bulk of the East Side office market), Pepper Pike, Orange Village, Moreland Hills, Hunting Valley and Chagrin Falls) turns into Kinsman Road (an \"underground pharmaceutical\" neighborhood) once crossing into the City of Cleveland proper.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["West Side Driving Tip"]},"\nAgain, staying on Lorain and Detroit Avenues, I-90, I-71 or the Shoreway (State 2) is your safest bet.
