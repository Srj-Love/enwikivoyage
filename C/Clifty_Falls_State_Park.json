The Ice Age brought on the formation of Clifty Falls, when south flowing waters of Clifty Creek met the Ohio River, plunging two hundred feet high. Eventually the falls cut their way more then two miles into the bedrock. Now it's sixty feet high, slowly making its way upstream at around one-quarter inch a year. \n\nMany of the stone work and pathways got their start from the Madison and Indianapolis railroad being built in the area around 1852. The railroad went bankrupt, leaving excellent foot trails and a muddy rock strewn 600-foot tunnel accessible by the trails.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\n425 million year old shale and limestone containing countless fossils can be viewed throughout the park in the bedrock.
