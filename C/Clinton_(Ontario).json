The story behind it is a remarkable one. For some 39 years a train car was set up as a school environment, moving from one remote village to the next. It would stay for a week at a time before moving on and was the only access to education for many settlers and rail worker's children in the area. Some of them would travel long distances to reach the School on Wheels, follow classes for a week and then take enough homework for self-study until the train's next visit. Teachers would live on board, for example Mr. Sloman with his family of five children, who served as a teacher for 39 years. Seven such cars existed in Northern Ontario and served children in remote areas from 1926 and the mid 1960's. There's no admission fee for the museum, but voluntary donations are appreciated."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Radar screen"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=The large radar screen in the town centre really can't be missed.
