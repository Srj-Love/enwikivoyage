The water will not be tropical but on a hot July day it is warm enough to cool down from the heat. The Maxwelton beach 4th of July parade is another local favorite.  For over 90 years this small-town parade has gained in popularity and visitors from all over the Puget Sound come to enjoy an old fashioned family parade complete with domestic animals dressed in their best red, white and blue.  There are sack races and pie eating contests and it's all set on the beautiful beach front.  If you decide to make the trek to Whidbey for this event, be advised that you need to arrive early to find a parking spot and to walk in. You are also welcome to participate in the parade, just arrive an hour early!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nClinton is a mostly residential town so specialty shops are rare but occasionally you will find a consignment shop or artist studio intermixed with the video and grocery stores.
