Due to the special preservation conditions within peat, many kinds of artefact which do not normally survive are preserved; these include for instance wooden structures and objects. In many parts of the Bog of Allen industrial milling has uncovered archaeological remains such as trackways. These trackways are wooden walkways constructed through prehistory and into the medieval period which allowed people and animals to cross the extensive areas of peatland, which can give us an insight into the economy and way of life of the societies that existed around the bog. The preservation conditions in bogs also preserve a range of palaeoenvironmental evidence such as pollen and plant macrofossils which are often studied alongside the archaeological evidence to inform about the environment on and around the bog."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Clonkeen stone"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=said to be 340 million years old and legend has it that the stone was thrown from Croghan Hill by Fionn MacCumhaill;"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Remains"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=remains of a togher at Ballykilleen;"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Cloncrane Church Ruins"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content= the ruins of Cloncrane Church"]]}]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Sky Diving"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Clonbullogue airfield is owned and operated by the Irish Parachute Club who are based at the field.
