It has never been adopted as an official National Trail, though a campaign has begun, but is hugely popular and came second (after the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Milford Track"]]},") in a recent poll among travel writers conducted by Country Walking magazine to find the finest walk in the world.\n\nAlong its route the walk passes through three National Parks - The ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lake District National Park"],["Lake District"]]},", the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yorkshire Dales"]]},", and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North York Moors"]]},". The creator suggested walking from West to East in order to enjoy the best possible views, and to have any prevailing weather at your back rather than in your face.\n\nThe original guide book was written in Wainwright's characteristic style of hand-written text and hand-drawn maps, in the same manner as his seminal ",{"type":"<","value":["i",["Pictorial Guides to the Lakeland Fells"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Prepare"]},"\nThe walk typically takes people two weeks to complete. You'll want a copy of the guidebook, maps, and suitable outdoor gear. The walk crosses through the mountains of the Lake District but generally keeps to the passes, apart from the occasional option to cross summits.\n\nWalkers may split the walk in various ways to suit the distance they want to walk in a day, though the availability of accommodation may limit this. The author suggested breaking the walk into twelve days, which makes about 16 miles a day. Some find this a little too much for comfort and choose to have the odd rest day or a couple of short days, or even to take other transport as substitution for a day or two.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]}," \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:St Bees railway station with sign.jpg"],["thumb"],["St Bees railway station with sign"]]}," To ",{"type":"[[","value":[["St Bees"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Train"]},"\n\nSt Bees has a station on the Cumbrian Coast rail line.

St Bees is a couple of miles to the west and will be signposted.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Walk"]}," \nThe walk starts at the seawall at the main beach St Bees; there is a monument to mark this with an interpretation board. The scenery throughout is beautiful, but also varied, since you pass through a number of different types of landscapes. The start is a coastal path walk, with cliffs, seabirds, and a lighthouse. Soon after heading inland you pass through the Lake District, which has a great variety of landscapes in itself. The northern part of the Yorkshire Dales is limestone country, then the Vale of Mowbray is lower level terrain. The North York Moors are peaty moorlands, and finally you reach the sea once more at Robin Hood's Bay among the highest cliffs in England.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nFor many days of the walk, there will be no pubs or kiosks during the length of the day's walk; avail yourself of a packed lunch.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nThe Falling Foss tea garden",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.fallingfossteagarden.co.uk\/"]}," has tea and a playground for children.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nYour main options are Bed & Breakfast (with occasional Youth Hostel options) or camping (including a Mongolian yurt at one point).
