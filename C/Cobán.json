There are also competitors, as well as more expensive shuttles.  A ticket to Coban on the Monja Blanca costs about 55 Quetzales per person (according to January 2012).\n\nThe real magic is all the villages the spread all over, during the way all the mountains are covered with unbelivable village of the Mayan.\nIf you look for ome time adventure just ask some local from Coban anout the villages, or in spanish Pueblo like Tactic, tomtem, yoho and you will discover a new world.\n\nFrom the Western Highlands, regular microbuses run from Quiche to Sacapulas to Uspantin to Coban (you will probably have to change buses in each town).  The road between Uspantin and Coban is only paved about half way, and has some rough stretches.  Travel time (in 2010), including time spent waiting for buses, is about 6 hours from Quiche to Coban and 2.5 hours from Uspantan to Coban.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nCoban is a relatively walkable city in terms of size (sidewalk conditions are horrible, however, and you should always assume that cars will take the right of way). For local destinations around Coban, there are buses that leave in front of Plaza Magdalena.\nYou can take a taxi almost anywhere around town for Q20 for something like 5 Kilometers. Always get in the taxis that are marked with a Taxi number on the door, the unmarked ones are not licensed to work as a taxi.\nAnother option is to take a bus (collectivo) that start from coban and finish at the nearest villages like Tactic, San cristobal and etc.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nBy walking on the street from the Parque Center to the terminal Market you will fell the Spirit of the Mayan, Workers from the nearest village that surrounding Coban come to the city in the morning to work and leave afternoon.\nThe people all over, their smile on the morning and Saying hallo at afternoon are the view.\n\nthe Main Cathedral at the town Center.\nSemuc Champey about two hours from Coban - There are private tours you can hire to get there that contains also visiting the Caves in lanquin.  \nOn 1 Avenida there are several tours guide.\n\nYou don't have to book tours or walk around with your nose buried in your LP guidebook to figure all this out.

Be sure to offer a lower price or ask what the sellers best price is.  Same goes for the market behind the cathedral.  Take a tour around and buy some of the local clothing.  A Huipil, or women's woven and sometimes embroidered shirt can go for as much as 500 Quetzales \/ $50 USD or more depending on the quality and detail of the work, so don't be surprised if it seems like a high price for a non-tailored shirt.  More simple styles can be found for about 100 Quetzales.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\"De La Abuela\" Hotel and restaurant serves traditional dishes and fresh seafood, but their specialty is the meatiest barbecue ribs in Guatemala.
