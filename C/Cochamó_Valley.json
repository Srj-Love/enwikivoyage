The valley is known as the Yosemite of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chile"]]},", a term and comparison first coined by Seattle Times reporter Bill Dietrich, who wrote about his horseback trek and visit in 1997. See ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/community.seattletimes.nwsource.com\/archive\/?date=19970223&slug=2525216 community.seattletimes.nwsource.com\/archive\/?date=19970223&slug=2525216"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Landscape"]},"\nWith its remote location, far removed from modern, urban living, Cochamó is like stepping back in time. The U-shaped valley, lined with 1000-meter grainte walls and peaks, was originally carved by a glacier millions of years ago. Lush, green pasture land gives way to dense, deep-green rainforest, and thence to bamboo forests and, eventually,bare, granite peaks that rise more than 3,000 feet from the upper valley floor. As for the waterfalls - there are more than you can count. And the water is clear, pure - and drinkable!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\nThe lush, virgin temperate rainforest - one of only three such natural treasures in the world - is a highlight of the valley. Towering native trees, hundreds and even thousands of years old, are entwined with ferns, vines, and the bell-like, bright-pink copihue flower. The Alerce trees (fitsroya cupressoides) are one of nature's wonders, living for up to 3,000 years. \n\nThe fauna is perhaps on a smaller, less-dramatic scale -- but still very unique, and often threatened. Lucky visitors often glimpse pudu (the world's smallest deer), or the flash of a wild boar racing through the trees. Puma do prowl the upper reaches, but are shy and rarely seen. The Darwin's Frog, a very are and endangered species, is to be found in this valley - as are nesting condors, caranchos, and a variety of migratory birds (ibises, humming birds, swallows, etc.) Occaionally, at the mouth of the Rio Cochamo a small family of black-necked swans makes a graceful appearance. \n\nAlthough trout are not native to the area, they were introduced more than a century ago - and now the Cochamo abounds with brown and rainbow trout. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nA pleasant season to visit the area is from October through April, although September and May can often be pleasantly clear and crisp, too. The months that usually have the best weather are December through March. Between May and August, the climate is generally cold and very rainy (90% of the area's rain falls in these southern-hemisphere winter months.) \n\nThe weather in Patagonia is difficult to predict, but locals have followed one general rule that helps forecast stormy weather. Clouds moving north to south generally bring rain.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\nThere are no entree fees or permits needed. Most of the valley is owned, however, by private individuals. Access into and through the valley is open along mostly a well-eroded trail. It's right to access is protected by Chilean law. Visitors are urged to respect boundaries, fences, and be careful with gates. Close a closed gate; leave an open one open. And be sure to pack out all your trash!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Getting There"]},"\nIf you are heading to Valle Cochamó from Santiago (Chile) or Bariloche (Argentina), you need to get to Puerto Montt or Puerto Varas as a starting point. Four buses daily leave from Puerto Montt and pass through Puerto Varas to pick up more passengers on route to Cochamó but unfortunately will not stop in Puerto Varas when full. Make sure to ask the bus driver to drop you in Pueblo Hundido part of Cochamó to hire a car to take you to the trailhead or simply get dropped off at the north side of the Cochamó River bridge and hike the six kilometers to the trailhead. If you arrive late, you can camp at Campo Aventura's Riverside Lodge or at the trailhead's Camping Los Pozones. \n\nThe trailhead is located six kilometers up river following a gravel road, that meanders through pastures and woods. It's possible to hire a car in town to drop you off at road's end where the trail begins.\n\nAt the end of the road or trailhead, cross a small bridge and pass through a gate. From that point, hiking into the valley takes four to five hours. The trail is well marked and never crosses the Cochamó River. The hiking is relatively easy except for crossing through some trenches, pools and streams, which can become harder to cross - when it rains heavily. Water proof hiking boots are highly recommended. Gaitors help significantly on rainy days. Continue to La Junta River, the center of activities and accommodation in the valley.\n\nRiding up the valley trail a great alternative to walking and much less strenuous. There are guides and horse rentals of all variety - so make sure to choose a reputable provider.\nMany visitors choose to visit the valley by horse or using packhorses. All horses are (or should be) accompanied by guides. Cochamó offers numerous different guides but tracking them down is not a formal task. Ask around town and expect to pay from $18.000 to $25.000 pesos per horse and be sure to find out if the guide charges for the horse he\/she uses. If starting the ride from the village of Cochamo, expect to ride for at least 5-6 hours, with a local resident who only speaks Spanish (and to carry your own food.) If riding on a program with Campo Aventura, the ride is an hour shorter; there is often an international guide; and meals and refreshments are provided along the way and upon arrival in the upper valley. \n\n",{"type":"*","value":["Many visitors have had continuous problems with one guide in paticular (website: www.cabalgatascochamo.cl) located in front of the police station in town.

Once traversed only by gauchos, missionaries and the occasional bandit (Butch and Sundance being the best-known of the latter), the trail is today being explored and used by travelers from all parts of the world. This is, in large part, due to the 'discovery' of this hidden gem by maverick traveler and journalist Clark Stede, was one of the early European visitors to this remote valley, in the waning years of the Pinochet regime. He was just 'passing by' in his aluminium yacht, but once he glimpsed the valley and his peaks - he decided to stay. Working with young local huasos, he explored the Cochamo Trail and other long-unused byways, and decided to lead and guide horseback explorations of this magnificent valley, thus bringing international tourism to little-known Cochamo. \n\nToday, the Cochamo Valley - specifically the upper La Junta section - is a famous rock climbing destination with many granite walls and domes ranging around 1000 meters. New routes are opened every year and thousands of new long lines are waiting to be done. For most other types of outdoor travelers, the multi-day horseback trekking and hiking activities remain the most popular and common way to access this natural treasure trove.\n\nIn addition to rock-climbing, the Cochamo and La Junta valleys offer visitors a rich feast of nature - crystal-clear pools and streams; towering ancient trees; scattered, occasional encounters with traditional mountain homesteaders; and dozens of hikes - ranging from easy to moderate to challenging. \n\nRelatively unknown until recently, the valley receives more and more hikers and climbers each year, which brings its own set of challenges - ill-prepared or ill-equipped visitors; littering and trash; unauthorised camping and fires. Whether the growing number of local and international visitors will respect the fragile environment and local inhabitants and their property, and do what they can to keep this \"Yosemite of Chile\" clean and unspoiled, remains to be seen.  \n\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Rock Climbing"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.cochamo.com\/climbing"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Thousand meter granite walls border the valley along the Cochamó River.
