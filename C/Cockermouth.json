This location tends to enhance the life and character of the town without the negative impact of receiving too many tourists (as some believe has occurred in the case of Cockermouth's neighbour ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Keswick"]]},"). Much of the architectural core of the town remains largely unchanged since the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nThe town has ancient roots and Romans, Vikings and Normans have each left lingering marks on the town and surrounding placenames. Curiously, Cockermouth lays claim to be the first town in Britain to pilot electric lighting, reputably in 1881. It is perhaps best known as the birthplace of William and Dorothy Wordsworth, John Grayston, and Fletcher Christian (of ",{"type":"''","value":["Mutiny on the Bounty"]}," fame). John Dalton (a father of atomic theory) was born in Eaglesfield, a village on the outskirts of Cockermouth, and Astronomer Royal Fearon Fallows also hailed from the town. Also world-famous mountaineer and TV personality Chris Bonnington is a native of the town. ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.wordsworthhouse.org.uk\/ Wordsworth House"]}]}," has recently been expensively restored and visitors may take tea in its 18th-century kitchen. Cockermouth is situated within a few minutes travelling distance from lakes such as Ennerdale Water, Crummock Water, Loweswater and Bassenthwaite Lake but is much less crowded with tourists than many Cumbrian towns. The tree-lined main street boasts a statue of Lord Mayo, formerly an MP for Cockermouth, who became British Viceroy of India and whose subsequent claim to fame was that he was assassinated.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nAttractions include the sizeable but partly ruined ",{"type":"'''","value":["Norman castle"]}," (still inhabited by Lady Egremont), built at the confluence of the Rivers Cocker and Derwent (complete with a tilting tower which hangs Pisa-like over Jennings Brewery).

Cockermouth has an annual Easter Fair, fireworks display and carnival. In April 2005 it hosted its first Georgian Fair, which was such a success it was repeated in April 2006, and will in future become a biennial event.
