Cocos lies approximately 12° south and 96.5° east, locating the islands in the humid tropical zone.\n\nThere are 27 coral islands in the group. Captain William Keeling discovered the islands in 1609, but they remained uninhabited until the 19th century. Annexed by the UK in 1857, they were transferred to the Australian Government in 1955. The population on the two inhabited islands generally is split between the ethnic Europeans on West Island and the ethnic Malays on Home Island.\n\nGrown throughout the islands, coconuts are the sole cash crop. Small local gardens and fishing contribute to the food supply, but additional food and most other necessities must be imported from Australia. There is a small tourist industry.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Orientation"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Cocos-keeling-islands-map.png"],["thumb"],["450px"],["Map of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands"]]},"\nThere are two inhabited islands in the group, West Island and Home Island.

The largest village is Bantam on Home Island with a population of around 400, most of whom speak the Cocos dialect of the Malay language.\n\nThe other islands in the archipelago are uninhabited. Horsburgh Island and South Island are among the larger uninhabited islands. Direction Island, a true island paradise, is connected by ferry every Saturday. Finally, there's North Keeling Island, a national park approximately 50km north of the other islands.

However these systems do not normally interfere with holiday plans. Rain usually falls in the evenings, bringing glorious sunny days! The average annual rainfall is 2,000mm!
