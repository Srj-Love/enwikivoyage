From 1919 to 1991 this island was a penal colony and quartered political prisoners and some of the most dangerous criminals in Panama. Known as Panama’s Devil’s Island, the government closed the penal colony in 1991, and turned it into the largest marine park in Central America. The central offices and cell blocks have recently been resurrected and can be visited. Nearby, a coast guard station has been built.\n\nUNESCO named Coiba National Marine Park a World Heritage Site in 2005 ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/whc.unesco.org\/en\/list\/1138"]}," identifying more than 800 marine species in the waters surrounding the park.\n\nCoiba is known for its ",{"type":"'''","value":["superior diving"]}," and was recently said to have the ",{"type":"'''","value":["best diving"]}," \"to be found along the Pacific Coast from Columbia to Mexico\".",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.panamainfo.com\/en\/node\/704"]},"\n\nCoiba is also home to various endemic species and subspecies. The Coiba spinetail (Cranioleuca dissita), a small bird, and the Coiba agouti (Dasyprocta coibae) only occur on Coiba island. The Coiba howler monkey (Alouatta coibensis) occurs on Coiba and in the Cerro Hoya National Park. Coiba island is also home of th elast population of scarlet macaws (Ara macao) in Panama.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\nThough its remote nature has helped to preserve the flora and fauna, it also served to deter visitors.  It is about an hour long boat ride from the coastal town of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Santa Catalina (Panama)"],["Santa Catalina"]]}," or two hours from the fishing village of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boca Chica"]]},", but most travelers rely on tour operators to reach the island.  This journey’s inconvenience is negligible, however, compared to the opportunities for scuba, snorkeling and sport fishing Coiba offers.\n\nAlternatively, you can travel to Mariato or Malena on the west coast of the Azuero peninsula and hire a boat there. The trip on sea will be longer, but you spend less time on the bus from Santiago to Mariato.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThere are no roads and few trails on the island.

So you will need to hire a boat for your entire trip.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" See and do "]},"\n\nScientists from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute have proclaimed Coiba an unparalleled destination for discovering new species. Rachel Collin, a Smithsonian project coordinator said, \"It's hard to imagine, while snorkeling around a tropical island that's so close to the United States, that half the animals you see are unknown to science.”  ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.stri.org\/"]},"   Its unique location protects it from the damaging winds and other effects of El Niño, allowing it to sustain the uninterrupted evolution of new marine species including whale and tiger sharks, sperm whales, sea turtles, angel rays and giant schools of fish. It is also the last refuge for a number of threatened terrestrial animals such as the crested eagle and several sub-species of agouti, possum and howler monkey (including a Coiba Island Howler Monkey). The park is gaining a reputation for being what the Moon travel book calls a “Garden of Eden”; touting the second largest coral reef (Bahia Damas Reef) in the Pacific.\n\nTo get a good impression of Coiba, you should plan to stay there for at least two days. Snorkel at Granito de oro with White-tipped reef sharks and turtles, walk de Sendero de monos to get an impression of the forest on the island, visit the rehabilitated prison and the mangrove forest nearby and yuo will havve an idea of what Coiba is about. On your way back, stop at Wahoo rock to see of the whale sharks are around.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Eat and drink "]},"\n\nThere are no restaurants at Coiba National Marine Park.
