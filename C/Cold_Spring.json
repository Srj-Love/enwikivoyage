It was named a Federal Historic District in 1973. Prominance had faded since the foundry closed in 1911, but it's notoriety locally in the antiquities trade is negligible in comparison to the sheer touristic appeal of the village.\n\nCold Spring enjoys the temperate climate, but you should be aware that bad weather breaks on the mountains, as such you can enjoy 260+ days of sunshine a year, as well as the appropriately impressive thunder storm. To hear the echoes roll through the valley is really something! However, if you will be hiking, water is a must. The trees are appropriately shady, but you can go for miles in the mountains. \n\nThe tourist information booth is downtown by the river, on the east-side of the tracks. They also house two bathrooms behind them, which are usually clean.\n\nThere are several denominations in the area, specifically in Cold Spring are the Catholic church, near the river, The Episcopalian church on Main Street which is next to the traffic light, the Presbyterian church up one street from the Episcopalian, the Methodist church near the School, and the Baptist church which famously only has a handful of members and shares it's priest. They have been a new marketing strategy as 'the Church on the Hill' they are also the famous divide between Nelsonville and Cold Spring.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]}," \n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Stewart International Airport"]},", 1180 First St, New Windsor, ",{"type":"''","value":["+1 845"]}," 564-2100, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.stewartintlairport.com"]},".

Any train will stop on it's way south in the town of Garrison as well.\n\nAlso on the weekends is a Trolley that does a circuit a few times a day. To acquire some more information about it, visit the tourism information booth by the bathrooms on the East side of the train tracks. There is often a volunteer there from the Village Board. The ride is scenic and relaxed, reputedly only costing a dime. The stops are various points of interest in Cold Spring, the Garrison train station and Boscobel.\n\nThe most common way to get around is to walk. The country can be steep so leave yourself time. The Hudson Valley enjoys around 260 days of sunshine a year, usually more, so please hydrate appropriately! The cheapest water to be found is either free from the faucets in the always-open bathrooms down by the tracks (the water is reputedly from the Catskills and is the same that services the School's water fountains) or for one-dollar at the Chinese Take-out, Ming Moon.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]}," \n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Boscobel"]},", 1601 Route 9D, Garrison, ",{"type":"''","value":["+1 845"]}," 265-3638, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.boscobel.org"]},".
