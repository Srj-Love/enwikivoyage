Part of the danger is that mild hypothermia makes one feel tired and clouds judgement, so victims may sit down, stray away or do other things totally inappropriate for the situation."]},"\nCold weather, in particular hypothermia, is ",{"type":"'''","value":["potentially lethal"]},". Someone who falls into water at just above the freezing point and is not wearing protective gear has a life expectancy well under an hour, and longer exposure to less intense cold can also kill; in some cities, homeless people die from hypothermia every winter. In wilderness areas, or anywhere without warm shelter, you need three things to survive – skills, clothing and equipment. A serious deficiency in any of the three can be fatal, though high quality in any one can partly compensate for deficiencies in the others.\n\nKeep in mind that clothing that feels adequate for short walks may be all too cold when you have to stay outdoors for extended periods. Also remember that nights and early mornings may be much colder than the day. With windy, rainy, or snowy conditions, more protective clothing is required. Trying to just \"tough it out\", which may be possible in warmer climates, can be dangerous.\n\nApart from the cold itself, there are also some dangers from the ice and snow. These are discussed under ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Related risks"],["related risks"]]}," below.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Clothing"]},"\n\nNear and below freezing point, you should ",{"type":"'''","value":["cover your entire body"]},". Don't neglect gloves, headwear or scarves. At colder temperatures you should be ",{"type":"'''","value":["careful where clothes join"]},", such as at wrists, the waist and the neck; too short a shirt will cool the back and an exposed wristwatch may cause frostbite in extreme temperatures. It is common to choose clothes that overlap considerably, or that include some method of sealing their edges (drawstring, elastic, velcro or fasteners), to alleviate such problems.\n\nSpecial attention should be paid to clothing babies, children and youth correctly; ",{"type":"'''","value":["children need warmer clothes than adults"]}," because they have a higher ratio of skin area to weight. The old joke that defines a sweater as \"a garment that a child puts on when its mother feels chilly\" actually describes a reasonable policy in many cases; children may not clearly communicate discomfort or symptoms, so adults must watch out for them. As a rule of thumb, a child needs one more layer of clothing than an adult in the same weather.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Bergschuhe hg.jpg"],["thumb"],["Warm boots are fundamental to winter clothing."]]},"\nPay great attention to ",{"type":"'''","value":["footwear"]},". Boots should be high enough for snow not to enter (preferably also protected in other ways). The sole must be thick enough and the boot itself and socks (double pairs) should be warm. Use removable insulating insoles. Near the freezing point boots must be protected from wet snow, e.g. by waxing. Below -5°C moisture is less of a problem, but sunshine may still melt snow on the boots.\n\nAlso pay attention to the ",{"type":"'''","value":["head"]},"; it needs plenty of insulation and good protection from wind. The circulation system is adapted to warm up the brain at the expense of other organs, so a naked head may not feel cold, but it can quickly drain the body of heat, and risks frostbite of the ears, which can be very painful. A hood protects the ears and (if extending forward) the face. Scarves or balaclavas make the experience much more comfortable by keeping the neck warm, instead of having to keep the shoulders in a permanent shrug.\n\nYou also need ",{"type":"'''","value":["mittens or gloves"]},"; mittens have less surface area than gloves, so they lose less heat. For driving, photography and some other activities, you need to use your hands. It is common to wear a light pair of gloves for that with thick mittens over them to keep the hands warm the rest of the time.\n\nFor materials, ",{"type":"'''","value":["avoid cotton"]}," because it keeps moisture which can contribute to hypothermia. This is especially important for underwear, since if one breaks a sweat, cold and damp cotton feels like being dipped in a pool of cold water. Wool, silk and some synthetics are more suitable. Materials with many small ",{"type":"'''","value":["pockets of trapped air"]}," — especially duck or goose down and some microfiber synthetics — are ideal, combining light weight with excellent thermal insulation. Wool and fur are heavier but they also have insulating air pockets; wool is very good anywhere that it is protected from moisture, for example in socks, sweaters or a cap worn under a hood. Woolen trousers are better than cotton, but not ideal if they get wet.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:PSM V83 D332 Ukrainian immigrant wearing sheepskin coat.png"],["thumb"],["Ukranian sheepskin coat"]]},"\nNone of those materials are ",{"type":"'''","value":["waterproof"]}," or ",{"type":"'''","value":["wind-resistant"]},", so you need another layer for that. Fur worn as the Inuit (Eskimo) do — waterproof skin outside, insulating fur inside — sheepskin worn the same way, as many natives of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Central Asia"]]}," and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Caucasus"]]}," do, or a more conventional parka with a waterproof shell over a warm lining are ideal (but the clothes should \"breathe\", i.e. allow enough air circulation).\n\nSeveral ",{"type":"'''","value":["layers"]}," of clothing are often better than a single warm coat. Usually one should have at least a wind stopping outer layer, a warm sweater for breaks and other clothing as needed. At freezing long underwear (long johns) is advisable, at colder temperatures necessary. Pantyhose (tights) are unsuitable, as they (the tight thin types) make the legs feel warm by stimulating blood circulation in the skin, not by insulating.\n\nThe clothing should allow easy adjustments when you enter a windy area or start climbing a steeper hill. You should be able to add or remove layers depending on overall temperature. Clothing feeling warm at -5 °C is probably not at all sufficient at -20 °C (and such a drop in temperature from day to night is not extreme).\n\nIt is possible to stay warm with a short jacket and ski pants, provided the waist is well sealed, and that sort of outfit may be required for some activities. However, you could also ",{"type":"'''","value":["consider a longer coat"]},". People who spend a lot of time outdoors in the Arctic — such as the Russian Army and various northern tribes — often wear coats that reach well below the knee, and even city dwellers in cold areas often wear coats that go to mid-thigh to protect sensitive areas. For women, an ankle-length wool skirt is surprisingly warm when worn with good boots and stockings, quite likely good enough for an afternoon stroll in town even in the Arctic, though not for really severe conditions.\n\nWhen staying overnight in a tent, hut or other primitive lodgings clothes should be easy to dry. Boots or gloves with thick linings can be problematic. Carrying spare dry clothing — especially gloves, socks and boot liners or insoles — is a good idea anywhere, necessary on hikes.\n\nThe best way to get good equipment is buying it little by little (so that you have time to discover what works for you), with advice from experienced friends or going to speciality shops with good service. A good speciality shop should be able to sell you a complete set of equipment that fulfils your needs, but unless you know what you need, you will probably get unnecessarily expensive gear.\n\nEspecially if going for extreme adventures, you should also have some time and advice for learning to know your clothes, both what to take when going out a certain morning and how to adjust them in different conditions.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Food, drinks and rest "]},"\nKeeping warm requires energy and is much harder when hungry – or tired. Have enough food and enough snack and food breaks. \n\nRaisins and fructose pills are good for instant energy. Chocolate, while high in energy, loses its taste when cold.\n\nMore drinking water is needed than in mild weather. Warm drinks, such as tea, coffee or hot chocolate, are also good for the mood. Water or drinks in ordinary bottles will freeze, use thermos bottles and local supplies (e.g. clean snow, if you have cooking equipment) instead, or keep a small bottle in a pocket inside the jacket. Avoid alcohol, as it affects blood circulation in the skin.\n\nRest is important, as keeping warm is more difficult – and making bad decisions easier – when tired. But when really tired you must not rest until having found safe shelter, as continuing after the rest may be difficult, especially if part of the company is suffering from hypothermia. In such cases, do not let anybody sit down or stay still until the shelter is ready, warm and comfortable. Make sure everybody puts on their rest sweaters also on ordinary breaks.\n\nMoving is essential to keep warm. Especially with children, it is good to encourage games of tag, round dancing, or any physical activity during breaks, before they would otherwise become miserable or even passive. Adults are harder to engage, but often benefit the same way. Such activity should not make people wet with sweat though, and at extreme temperatures breathing gently may be important.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Wind and moisture "]},"\nCold weather is much less dangerous when not combined with wetness or wind. Adjust labour and clothing to avoid sweating. Avoid having your clothes and shoes get wet by melting snow (or by water). Avoid open windy terrain if you are near your limits. Get shelter for the breaks. Do use your dry spare clothes as needed. Changing clothes may be uncomfortable, but not changing will prove more so.\n\nCotton fares very badly in cold weather when moist or wet. One should avoid cotton undershirts if exercising and sweating; instead, wool and artificial fibers retain more of their insulating ability when moist. The same applies to socks; woolen socks are better than cotton socks.\n\nGetting drenched at freezing temperatures, as in falling into water, is an emergency. Without a change of clothes or going inside into a warm room, hypothermia quickly sets in. In cold water, useful movement is possible up to 10 minutes and survival up to 30 minutes. However, the immediate cold shock response is more likely to cause a heart attack or drowning.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Transport "]},"\nCars should be equipped with a cabin air heating system for a comfortable ride and for safety. Moreover, the humidity from occupants breathing tends to frost over the windows, and removing the frost requires flowing warm air. Gas stations sell winter-grade diesel and gasoline in winter; summer-grade diesel may cloud and freeze over. Car engines can be pre-heated with engine block heaters to prevent starting problems. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Winter driving"]]}," is more difficult than summer driving because of slippery roads; the traction is often too weak to permit tight turns at a higher speed than about 30 km\/h.\n\nCarry enough emergency equipment in the car to survive if it slides off the road and you need to wait to be rescued (or if thick snow on the road forces you to stop). The most important items are enough sleeping bags to keep everyone warm and some means of emergency communication – cell phone or CB rig depending where you are. Food, beverages, candles and emergency flares are also a good idea. If a vehicle does crash or fail it is almost always best to ",{"type":"''","value":["stay in the car"]},"; this provides some shelter, avoids the risk of getting lost, and makes it easier for rescuers to find you.  \n\nWhen biking, snowmobiling or motorbiking, much more protective clothing is required than when walking. The relative wind easily finds its way through gaps and holes in the clothing. Protective glasses, face-covering balaclavas and possibly hard face shields are used. Motorcycle helmets are usually equipped with vents that can be shut for cold weather. However, bike helmets are built for letting the wind in rather than keeping it out, and the cold wind can cause tremendous headaches. Using a tight-fitting warm hat is necessary, and some cyclists tape over the openings in the helmet from the inside.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Overnight stay"]},"\nStaying outdoors overnight in freezing weather should be done only with great caution and careful planning, in a shelter, with a good enough sleeping bag and with good insulation to the ground (air mattresses for the beach are worthless, mattresses for hiking not necessarily enough). Everything outside the sleeping bag will freeze.\n\nMost good sleeping bags are nowadays marked with a \"comfort\" and an \"extreme\" temperature. At the comfort temperature you are supposed to get a good rest (but conditions and people vary). If night temperatures are expected to come anywhere near the \"extreme\" point, you will not want to sleep outdoors without fire and good shelter. Remember that most weather forecasts cite day temperatures.\n\nIf you intend to stay the night by a fire, be sure to collect enough firewood before going to sleep and to have a watch all the time. Skill is needed to use the fire effectively.\n\nWhen staying overnight indoors, make sure to get shoes and clothes properly dried (without overheating them). Unlike at home, things will not dry automatically in a wilderness hut.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Emergencies "]},"\nIf you are away from inhabited areas you must be able to cope with emergencies yourself, at least for some time. Somebody who becomes disabled or wet (stepping through the ice of a river or even a ditch) may soon risk hypothermia.\n\nIf lost, you can dig a pit in the snow for protection against the wind. A more elaborate option is building a wall from igloo bricks, which can protect a tent. A snow cave is a good option if you have the know-how, otherwise they are dangerous. If you can choose between open terrain on one hand and forest or other sheltered areas on the other, choose the latter for your camp, even if not in immediate vicinity.\n\nA disabled person must have good insulation from the ground and much warmer clothing than those who can stay warm by moving. You probably have hiking mattresses and blankets that can be used. Sharing a sleeping bag is a very good way of keeping somebody warm (there are also models that can be combined). You might want to build some kind of shelter (e.g. a big cloth rigged with ropes) and make a fire. In some cases you will have to construct some kind of sledge or travois (e.g. two young trees with a platform between them, carried by the thicker forward end and soft branches left in the other end keeping it afloat on the snow), but usually it is better to have the help come to you.\n\nIf somebody gets thoroughly wet boots or clothes, they must be changed without much delay. There might be a house nearby, where you can seek shelter. Otherwise you hopefully have enough spare clothes. Wet boots can still be used by having the foot and warm dry socks in a plastic bag inside the boot. You might want to camp soon to be able to dry the clothes at a fire (which will take a lot of time).\n\nAn acute threat of hypothermia is an emergency. Therefore, if exposed and without means of recovery from the situation, one should promptly ask for help, or in the absence of other means, seek shelter by any means necessary, not wait for the situation to get worse. In the event of getting lost in a foreign city at night without warm clothes or a cellphone, one should contact emergency services or anyone nearby, not wander around until hypothermia clouds the consciousness. It is especially important to tell youth and children to not wander around if they get lost, but contact an adult immediately.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Frostbite and hypothermia "]},"\nThere are two dangers in cold weather: frostbite and hypothermia. \n\nFrostbite means damage caused to skin and other tissues due to freezing. Cooling the skin is painful, so you should react to it as soon as the pain appears, since sensation is lost on further cooling and then damage occurs unnoticed. The condition is much like burns. The nose, ears, chin and cheek are the body parts most easily affected, especially in windy weather, and like sunburn the condition might not get noticed until too late. Watch out for white spots in your fellows' skin. Fingers and toes may also get frostbitten, but you will more easily notice them getting uncomfortable. Also, touching metal surfaces with bare skin can cause frostbite. First aid is gently warming the affected area with a warm body part, such as the armpit, and protecting it from further coldness.\n\nHypothermia is overall reduced body temperature. It will lead to loss of initiative, sluggish thinking and irrational behaviour. Keeping on walking even when tired is important, not only to reach shelter, but also to keep warm (and in case of hypothermia: you can usually get a walking person to come with you, but getting somebody to raise and ",{"type":"''","value":["start"]}," walking is much more difficult). In severe cases it is important to warm the victim slowly, without massaging, because cold blood from arms and legs may cause vital organs to fail.\n\nThe elderly, the disabled and children are more vulnerable to frostbite and hypothermia. Children might try to lick a metal rail or another surface, which instantly freezes the tongue, and the usual response, jerking back, tears off the frozen part of the mucous membrane, resulting in a bleeding wound. Many children in cold countries have tried this once, but not twice.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Related risks "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Yaktrax to walk on ice.jpg"],["thumb"],["Slip prevention footgear"]]},"\nWhere there is cold weather, there is usually snow and ice, which in themselves can pose some risks.\n\nThe most common cause for accidents in winter is slippery roads, pavements (sidewalks) and especially steps. At a minimum, you need footwear with suitable soles. Sometimes add-on equipment, such as tire chains on cars or devices like those in the photo, may be used to prevent slipping. Scattering sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) on roads or paths can also improve traction.\n\nIn slippery conditions it is generally advisable to do a \"penguin walk\" with very short steps rather than the longer stride used in other circumstances. This reduces the tendency to slip because there is less horizontal force where the foot meets the ground. Also, if one foot does slip, your chances of recovering without a fall are better because your center of gravity is more nearly above the leg that still has traction.\n\nEven moderate snowfall – or wind causing snow to fly around – will reduce visibility substantially. It will also cover your trail in little time. In open landscape, like on mires, lakes and fell heaths, you will need some way to keep a course accurate enough to find shelter. Really thick snowfall can make it difficult even to find the route across a yard.\n\nThe snow will often hide dangers, such as cracks in the ice and clefts in the rock, or give the impression a cliff extends farther than it does.\n\nIn mountainous terrain avalanches are a real risk. Always use local warning services.\n\nEven in town, falling ice or snow can be a serious danger. In particular, icicles may come off the edge of a roof and hit pedestrians below, and a heavy chunk of ice dropping several storeys can be fatal.   \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Ice safety"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["main"],["Ice safety"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Québec-LacBeauportGelé.JPG"],["thumb"],[{"type":"[[","value":[["Ice skating"],["Skating"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Quebec"]]}]]},"\nThe frozen sea, lakes and rivers may be inviting. A number of activities on frozen bodies of water – ",{"type":"[[","value":[["skating"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["snowmobiling"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["ice fishing"]]}," and ice boating – are fairly common. During prohibition, bootleggers even ran truckloads of booze from Canada into the US across the frozen Saint Lawrence; those were quite heavy but reasonably safe with two meters of mid-winter ice. However, always seek knowledgeable local advice on which areas are safe. The ice may be thin or otherwise unreliable in some areas, even when thick in general. If the ice breaks, it is hard or impossible to get out without tools or assistance. Purpose-designed ice climbing picks, worn on a sling around the neck are sold to ice fishers.\n\nThere may also be substantial dangers from the sheer speeds involved in some modes of moving. An ice boat is far faster than a normal sailboat, because of the low friction, and a good skater is much faster than a runner, but if you fall ice is as hard as concrete. Skiers and snowboarders do not have to worry about the hardness of ice, but they also move fast enough that any mistake can cause serious injury.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Most importantly..."]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Have fun!"]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cross country skiing"],["Skiing"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["snowmobiling"]]}," or snowshoeing in an Arctic night, with northern lights shining, is an unforgettable experience.
