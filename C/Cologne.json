It is one of the nation's media, tourism and business hotspots, and is considered one of the most liberal cities in Germany.\n\nCologne has a rich history reaching as far back as the times of the ancient Roman Empire, when it was founded and remained a constantly inhabited important regional centre since then. Compared to other German and European cities, the ancient and medieval Cologne was relatively large, covering most of the modern-day city centre, and therefore a wealth of architectural heritage can be found across the city ranging from pre-Christian times to strikingly modern buildings, with a high concentration of Romanesque and Gothic architecture, culminating with the magnificent Cathedral (",{"type":"''","value":["Dom"]},").\n\nCologne is, however, not only a tourist destination, but on an equal note a major economic centre, a globally important trade fair location, a culture and media hotspot and a major transportation hub. This equal mix of roles and functions is permeable throughout the city and provides it with a constant inflow of various visitors, as well as a very diverse population mix. This all culminates during the traditional Karneval, and makes Cologne one of the most-visited destinations in Germany.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Orientation"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Koeln bezirke1.png"],["thumb"],["upright=1.3"],["The districts of Cologne"]]},"\nCologne lies on both side of the river Rhine, which flows through it in a northerly direction.

In more traditional bars and especially the breweries, the waiter (called \"Köbes\" in local language) will even hand you a fresh Kölsch without being asked, so it is easy to lose track of how much you drank. He will put a pencil line on your coaster for each beer that you drank, this will be the basis for your bill, so do not lose it! To stop the beer from coming, leave your glass almost half full until you have asked for the bill or put your coaster on top of your empty glass.\n\nIf you buy bottled Kölsch, take either \"Reissdorf\", \"Früh\", \"Gaffel\" or \"Mühlen\", which are rated highest by Cologne citizens.
