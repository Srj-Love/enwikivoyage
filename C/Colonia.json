Its strategic position and use as a smuggling port meant that its sovereignty was hotly contested and the city changed hands several times between Spain and Portugal and was for a while also part of Brazil before the independence of Uruguay.\n\nThe city has 20,000 inhabitants and is a popular destination for people from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Buenos Aires"]]}," on the opposite side of Rio de la Plata.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Tourist Office"]},"\nThere is a large tourist information center adjacent to the ferry terminal, a tourism booth in the bus terminal, a larger one in the basement of the cultural center two blocks from the terminals along Odriozola\/Calle Florida and as well as a small office at the western terminus of Calle Manuel Lobo near the old city gate.

There are both slower ferries that also carry cars and faster ferries that just takes people across. The fast Buquebus catamaran ferry (one hour) costs around USD70 return (when booked in advance) and around USD110 when booked the day prior and is usually quite crowded with day tourists and travel groups. One of the fast boats have free wireless internet (WiFi, satellite link) Make sure you book in advance for weekends and the peak season (Christmas until the end of February). The slower boat costs ARS102 (from Buenos Aires) round trip, and takes about 3 hours. Note that although you are traveling North-South, the time in Colonia is 1 hour ahead of Buenos Aires, so it is important to reset your watch (especially if you don't want to miss your boat on the way back). \n\nA cheaper possibility is to take a boat from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tigre"]]}," (north of Buenos Aires) to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Carmelo"]]}," in Uruguay.

The ride takes 2.5 to 3.5 hours depending on stops and several bus companies operate the route. One-way ticket prices start at about UYU200, in May 2014 a one-way ticket with COT was UYU281 including the service fee when bought over the counter in Montevideo. There are no two-way tickets, and if you are traveling to Colonia and back you will pay exactly as much as two single tickets. \n\nBe careful with people telling you that all buses are booked out. This is in general not true, as you can also buy tickets on board if you don't have one when boarding the bus and there are places to stand on board if all the seats are full. A taxi is several times more expensive, and should probably be considered only in emergencies.
