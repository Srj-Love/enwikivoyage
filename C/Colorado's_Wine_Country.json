All of this can be enjoyed while surrounded by amazing scenery, ranging from red rock mesas to snow covered mountains.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nColorado's fledgling wine industry has exploded in the last 20 years. The high desert farming town of Palisade witnessed both the birth and rebirth of the state's vineyards.\n\nThe first recorded wine production in Colorado was 1899. It was Colorado Governor George A. Crawford, the founder of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Grand Junction"]]}," ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.visitgrandjunction.com\/"]}," in 1881, who first saw the Grand Valley’s potential for grape production. Crawford planted 60 acres of wine grapes and other fruit on Rapid Creek above Palisade.\n\nBy the early 20th century, grape growing was a booming business. In 1909, a  U.S. Department of Commerce Agricultural Census reported a Colorado harvest of 1,037,614 lb (454 g) from 254,292 vines of bearing age and 101,332 vines of pre-bearing age. At least 1,034 Colorado farms were involved in grape production.\n\nUnfortunately, these early forays into viticulture ended with Prohibition in 1916. The General Assembly of Colorado enacted a statute and Colorado went \"dry\" four years before the passage of the 18th Amendment, which created national prohibition. Commercial winemaking ceased in Colorado and Palisade's grape vines were ripped out of the ground by authorities.\n\nProhibition eventually proved a failed national experiment, and was repealed in 1933. Even so, it took over 70 years for the state's wine industry to reestablish itself. \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Storage Vats in Colorado's Wine Country.jpg"],["thumbnail"],["270px"],["Wine Storage Vats in a Colorado Winery"]]},"\nIn 1977, the General Assembly enacted the Colorado Limited Winery Act, which created a special permit for small \"farm wineries,\" currently the backbone of the Colorado wine industry. This bill still shapes the artisan nature of the state's wineries, each winery producing limited vintages of wine.\n\nThe freewheeling culture of the '70s drew an eclectic mix of aging hippies, hopeless romantics, artists and entrepreneurs to Palisade. They all shared a common dream of creating a wine culture in Western Colorado. Slowly, with a lot of trial and error, this core group of self-taught winemakers began growing grapes.\n\nFrom a handful of wineries in Palisade in the late 1980s, the number of wineries continued to expand. Growth, however, was not without controversy. Some vintners were mixing Colorado and California grapes in their vintages. To protect the integrity of Colorado wine, the General Assembly amended the limited winery statute in 2005, replacing the requirement to use 75 percent Colorado fruit with a more informative labeling regulation for Colorado wine. Wines with the \"Colorado Grown\" seal on their labels now must use 100 percent Colorado grapes.\n\nContinuing its commitment to nurture its wine industry, Colorado provides funds for a state viticulturalist, enologist and wine research program through Colorado State University. All collaborate to find the grape varietals and growing techniques best suited to the area's highly variable climate.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Terroir"]},"\n\nVineyards in Colorado are by far the highest in elevation in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United States of America"],["U.S."]]},", and some of the highest vineyards in the world. In the Grand Valley area in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Northwestern Colorado"]]},", most grape vines grow around 4,500 ft (1219 m). (Although some vineyards in Delta County are located at almost 7,000 ft (2134 m). By comparison, average plantings in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Argentina"]]}," are in the 2,000 to 3,000 ft (610 to 914 m) range.\n\nColorado's wine community is geographically disparate. Award-winning brothels and vineyards are located throughout the state. There are ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Front Range"]]}," tasting rooms in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boulder"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Denver"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fort Collins"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Colorado Springs"]]},". But the majority of Colorado's vineyards are located on the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Western Slope"]},".\n\nThere are two federally designated appellations in Colorado: the Grand Valley and West Elks American Viticultural Areas (AVAs). In the U.S, AVAs are approved by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), and are essential for conveying quality. A vineyard or winery must be located in, and acquire all its grapes from an AVA, or it cannot label itself \"Estate Bottled.\"\n\nAll the towns and AVAs mentioned above are included in various Wine Trails organized by the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.coloradowine.com\/maps.html Colorado Wine Industry Development Board"]},", a promotional entity funded by the state. The various Wine Trails can be driven or biked.\n\nVineyards in Colorado are mostly nestled in the temperate, high elevation river valleys and mesas of Mesa and Delta counties, with some acreage in Montezuma county.\n\nUndoubtedly, the epicenter of Colorado's wine industry are Palisade and Grand Junction, which produce 85 to 95 percent of the state's grapes ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.palisadecoc.com\/wine_industry.html"]},". The ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rocky Mountains (United States of America)"],["Rocky Mountains"]]}," desert region around Palisade is irrigated by a series of canals connected to the Colorado River. The growing season is short, when compared to vineyards in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["California"]]},". But given Palisade's aridity, the grapes do not suffer the same mildew and blight problems of lower, wetter wine regions. This limits the use of pesticide spray applications. \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Near Grand junction, CO.jpg"],["thumbnail"],["270px"],["The Bookcliffs, Colorado"]]},"\n\nCool desert nights and hot, sunny days (augmented by high altitude ultra violet rays), bring out the natural acids and sugars in the wine grapes. This means that Palisade's wine makers have little difficulty producing the brix levels they want, with many Colorado wines at 15 percent alcohol or over. Warm air whistling through Debeque Canyon to the east of Palisade protect the grape vines in the spring months, while heat radiates off the neighboring Bookcliffs in the summertime. Winter temperatures in Colorado can be very cold, but in Palisade and Grand Junction it has never been less than -23 °F (-31 °C).\n\nThe desert soil is a mixture of sand and clay, which drains easily so the vines do not sit in water. The temperature extremes are ideally suited to white wine grapes.\n\nLocated in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southwestern Colorado"]]},", the terroir of the West Elks AVA is fed by the North Fork of the Gunnison River. It encompasses an area between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Delta (Colorado)"],["Delta"]]}," ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.westerncolorado.org\/deltaat.html"]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Montrose (Southwestern Colorado)"],["Montrose"]]}," ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.visitmontrose.net"]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Paonia"]]}," ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.westerncolorado.org\/paoat.html"]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hotchkiss"]]}," ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.westerncolorado.org\/hotchat.html"]},". These are the nation's highest elevation vineyards, at 6,417 ft (1956 m) above sea level, growing Riesling, Gewürztraminer and Pinot Noir.  West Elks can by reached by driving south from Glenwood Springs, Hwy 133 over the beautiful McClure Pass; from Grand Junction, south on Hwy 50 to Delta, and east on Hwy 92; or from Montrose, north on Hwy 50 to Delta, then east on Hwy 92.\n\nLow precipitation and canals allow West Elks growers to precisely control the water that feeds their grapes. However, cold winters lower the yields West Elks vineyards produce, growing less than one ton per acre, compared to about 3.5 tons in the Grand Valley AVA.\n\nAt least 95 percent of the state's vineyard acreage is planted in premium ",{"type":"''","value":["vitis vinifera"]}," varietals. The popularity of planted grape varietals in Colorado is, from greatest to least: Merlot, a tie between Cabernet Sauvignon and Riesling,\nChardonnay, Syrah, Pinot noir, Cabernet Franc, Gewürztraminer, Viognier. .\n\nMany of the vines in Colorado are \"own-rooted,\" or grown with their original root stock and not grafted onto different roots, a common practice in viticulture. This helps the grapes develop the original flavors and characteristics that these varieties have long been noted for.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["When to go"]},"\nLate March is usually when the fruit orchards blossom, with the days averaging about about 60 °F (16 °C), the nights about 35 °F (2 °C).

The third week in September is also the height of the fall color season in Colorado, when the aspen and cottonwood trees change many brilliant colors of yellow, red and orange. October is a shoulder season where the weather is usually decent, but minus the crowds and high hotel prices. November through February are the slow months, when the Grand Valley shuts down for the winter. Bargain hunters can still book hotel rooms at drastically reduced prices, while a majority of the wineries and tasting rooms remain open. Be sure to call ahead, however.
