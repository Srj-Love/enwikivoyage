One of the party decided to try panning in a nearby stream, and found gold in his first pan. Within a few months, several thousand miners were in the vicinity, in one of the richer areas of placer mining. Although mining largely stopped because of the seasonal drying up of the stream, a town was laid out and built, largely on speculation that water for mining could be obtained by an ambitious project using wooden flumes and ditches to bring water from the Stanislaus River.\n\nThis water project was successful and Columbia became a thriving and wealthy Gold Rush town during the 1850s. Around 1860, however, the placer mining had petered out, and the town lost population and stagnated. This stagnation led to town to change little, and by the 1930s attempts were begun to preserved it as a good example of a Gold Rush town. In the 1940s it was purchased by the state of California and made into a State Historic Park.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nColumbia is best reached by automobile, either by following the Gold Country Route 49 highway south from Calaveras County and the northern part of the Gold Country, or by taking Route 108 from the Central Valley (Modesto) to Sonora and then driving a few miles north on Highway 49.
