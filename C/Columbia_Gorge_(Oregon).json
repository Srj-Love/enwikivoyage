The bountiful presence of water on the west side of the Cascades leads to a number of very tall waterfalls which intersect the river. The key distinguisher of climate in the gorge is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Wind"]},".   Wind speeds are often upwards of 30mph. This is because the gorge is a wind tunnel from the warm\/dry east end to the cooler\/damp west end.  A large number of wind turbines have been installed on the ridges of both sides of the Gorge to take advantage of the power of the winds in this area.\n\nThe unique setting of the Gorge is partly due to repeated mass floodings at the end of the last ice age, when the collapse of ice dams near Missoula, Montana caused walls of water over 1000 feet high at the east end of the gorge, which were still over 2000 feet deep when they reached present-day Portland.\n\nThe region is included in the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.fs.fed.us\/r6\/columbia\/about\/welcome.html"]}," which protects the scenic quality of the region by requiring most new development to occur inside of existing towns.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nFrom downtown ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Portland (Oregon)"],["Portland"]]},", simply follow I-84 east toward The Dalles.
