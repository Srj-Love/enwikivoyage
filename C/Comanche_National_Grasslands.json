But for all that, the Comanche National Grassland has a lot to offer for wilderness backpacking, camping, and horseback-riding enthusiasts. There are a handful of great, well-marked canyon hikes, in addition to virtually limitless possibilities for off-the-trail wandering through the prairie. \n\nPerhaps the number one reason to visit is for the sense of real isolation the grasslands offer. Anywhere else you go in Colorado, you'll be sharing the hiking trails with fellow travelers, but the grasslands offer memorable hikes where you can see in all directions straight to the horizon, with not a single sign of civilization visible.\n\nThe Comanche National Grassland is split into two main units, the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Timpas Unit"]}," in the northwest, and the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Carrizo Unit"]}," in the southeast along the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oklahoma"]]}," border.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Comanche petroglyph.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Horse petroglyph"]]},"\n\nThe first visitors to really leave their mark did so in the Jurassic Era. The Picketwire Canyon trail boasts the Purgatoire River dinosaur tracksite, the largest assemblage of ",{"type":"'''","value":["dinosaur trackways"]}," in North America, which you can hike along (or in) for a long stretch of the trail.\n\nBut the Grasslands get their name from the Comanche Indians, who (along with the Arapaho and Kiowa peoples) lived and hunted in these parts before settlement by Europeans. The story of the Comanche Grasslands' inhabitants is older than these names, however, and it is written all over the canyon walls in the form of ",{"type":"'''","value":["petroglyphs"]}," (in Picture Canyon, Carrizo Canyon, and Vogel Canyon) and the remains of ",{"type":"'''","value":["prehistoric rock shelters"]}," (in Vogel Canyon). Not to be outdone by their prehistoric forebears, modern Americans have left their marks as well—wherever there is prehistoric art, you can expect that an appalling quantity of moronic name-scribbling will mar the visual experience. Oh well. Back to the history, though, the most intriguing prehistoric artifacts in Comanche adorn the walls of Crack Cave: rock carvings and glyphs that suggest astrological significance.\n\nEarly settlers rolled through a section of the Timpas Unit on the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Santa Fe Trail"]},". There's a marked 3 mile hike along the trail, where you can still see some old wagon ruts, by the Timpas Picnic Area. If you have a strong interest in the trail, definitely take a drive north to visit Bent's Old Fort National Historic Site up by ",{"type":"[[","value":[["La Junta"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\nGrassland conjures up the image of endless seas of unbroken, flat prairie, with rarely an antelope to break the 360° panoramas of the earth's curvature. The Comanche offers plenty such landscapes, but that's not all there is to see. Big canyons cut across the Colorado southeast, especially near the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Mexico"],["New Mexican"]]}," border. The popular canyon hikes run by interesting collections of mesas, spires, and hoodoo, with plenty of rock scrambling and even rock face climbing opportunities.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\nThe principle game animals on Comanche include elk, mule deer, pronghorn antelope, dove, quail, and turkey. Bird watchers have about 235 different species to look for. Threatened species include the burrowing owl, massasauga, northern harrier, ferruginous hawk, mountain plover, long-billed curlew, loggerhead shrike, grasshopper sparrow, swift fox, black-tailed prairie dog, plains leopard frog, whooping crane, and the American bald eagle. And watch your step for rattlers!\n\nSensitive flora species include the Andean prairie clover, Colorado Springs evening-primrose, Colorado frasera, Raven Ridge false goldenweed, sandhill goosefoot, and wheel milkweed. Prickly pear and cholla cactus are all over the place, so watch where you're going and consider wearing tough foot and leg wear.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nBecause this area has sandy land and dry air, people are advised to have plenty of water with them at all times.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Lonely road to nowhere.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Lonely road from nowhere to nowhere"]]},"\n\nIt's hard to imagine anyone arriving to the Comanche National Grassland in any form of transport other than a personal car, which will also be pretty necessary to get around to the various trailheads. The main route from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Denver"]]}," takes you through ",{"type":"[[","value":[["La Junta"]]}," to the lonely and beautiful route CO-109 South. From ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Trinidad (Colorado)"],["Trinidad"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Mexico"]]},", take CO-160 east, which will cut through the bottom portion of Comanche. From the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Panhandle (Texas)"],["Texas"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Red Carpet Country"],["Oklahoma"]]}," panhandles, take  287\/385 north from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boise City"]]},".\n\nDo not forget to ",{"type":"'''","value":["load up on gas"]}," before coming out here! There are almost no commercial gas stations in the area (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Springfield (Colorado)"],["Springfield"]]}," is probably the only option), and it is not unreasonable to expect go through more than a full tank of gas on a Comanche trip. Bringing spare gas is a basic safety measure.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\n\nThere are not a lot of fees or permits required out in these parts. Despite this, however, the camping sites and hiking trails are clean and remarkably well looked after. No admissions, no camping fees. Hunters...\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nThe dirt roads throughout Comanche are surprisingly well maintained, and should be perfectly accessible to low-clearance vehicles. You could get stuck in the mud during rain, though—it's a good idea to bring a shovel in your trunk just in case. The roads are unbelievably well marked with road signs too, so if you have good directions, you should be able to find your destination.\n\nIt's definitely worthwhile, in any case, to get an official grasslands map before heading out. The Grasslands are not solid blocks of territory, they are patchworks of public lands interspersed with private ranchlands, and it is best to stay aware of your location to avoid wandering on to someone's property. The official map is incredibly detailed, down to every last windmill and abandoned shack (although it stupidly leaves off the county road names), and is available for $10 from the US National Forest Store.",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.nationalforeststore.com\/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Store_Code=NFS&Category_Code=Grass"]},"\n\nThe canyon hikes are all well marked, so you shouldn't worry too much about getting lost on the trail, but if you plan to do serious off the trail wandering, a GPS (plus the official map) is a good idea. The grasslands can suddenly seem endless and they really are empty—you definitely will not run into people whom you can ask for directions.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nComanche isn't so much a sight-seeing destination, and the few \"attractions\" are right on the main hikes. Some of the most interesting things to see include the long set of dinosaur tracks on the Picket Canyon trail and the (sadly defaced) prehistoric rock drawings along the Picture Canyon and Vogel trails. Perhaps the most interesting attraction is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Crack Cave"]},", a small cave off the Picture Canyon trail full of prehistoric rock drawings and carvings of possible astronomical significance.

If you are hiking Picketwire, you may camp by the trailhead. Otherwise, it's best to camp relatively near a trail, since this section of the state is an often unpredictable patchwork of National Grasslands and private ranchlands. Ranchers might not take too kindly to squatters. The primitive campsite by the trailhead for Picture Canyon is a tribute to the US Forest Service—clean, excellent (albeit very primitive) facilities for tent campers in a quiet and relatively sheltered section of canyon.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Eastern Plains (Colorado)"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinepark"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["no Wikipedia link"]]}]
