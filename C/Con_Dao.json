The old prison buildings are still standing and are open to the public as is a small museum tracing the island's history. \n\nBesides having an interesting history, Con Dao is also an island of immense natural beauty with forested hills, deserted sandy beaches and extensive coral reefs making for some excellent diving.\n\nCon Dao is a shining example of good conservation. 80% of the land area of the archipelago is a national park offering primary jungle teeming with interesting life such as the endemic black squirrel and the crab eating macaque. Beautiful beaches and hidden lagoons are also to be found here, with very few tourists. Con Dao is a paradise off the beaten track. For now at least.\n\nMost of the surrounding seas are a \"no-take\" marine protected area (MPA). The level of protection and care shown to this island is evident in the pristine reefs that surround it, home to a large variety of marine life not found anywhere else in Vietnam.\n\nCon Cao National Park is currently undergoing scrutiny of its operations by the World Wildlife Fund and The United Nations Development Program. Both groups played a key role in the setup of the national park. Recently funding was withdrawn by another key aid organization DANIDA, as evidence was produced that the park was operating in violation of its charter and that the park was run for personal profit at the expense of the environment. Ask around on the island before using any of the national park services. International oversight is needed to be sure the environmental abuses are halted.\n\nRecent reports to national park officials of the spotting of slaughtered turtle shells drying in the sun on the roof of the Anh Dao Hotel have produced no inquiry, investigation, or prosecution.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\nCon Dao Airport (VCS) is served by VASCO (Vietnam Airlines) and ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/airmekong.com.vn\/ Air Mekong"]}," from Saigon (SGN).\n\nFlights operated by VASCO (Vietnam Airlines) Can be booked at Vietnam Airlines offices or most tour operators in Saigon. \n\n",{"type":"*","value":["USD115 return (May 2010) - "]},{"type":"*","value":["USD80 return (Nov 2010) "]},{"type":"*","value":["USD60-100 return (4\/2011)"]},{"type":"*","value":["USD120-170 return (Feb 2012)"]},"\nVasco agents run a bit of a scam in that they often sell all of the tickets to tour operators who then resell them (Then split the profits), only to release the tickets the day before a flight.

Flights have increased to as many as 9 per day (7\/12) but they are often booked far in advance, book early !\n\nThere is a boat from Vung Tau which takes about 11 hours. The boat from Vung Tau only leaves on certain days and it is best to book a week before hand to get a seat. Tickets must be brought in Vung Tau (no phone calls, staff speak Vietnamese only) or on Con Dao. Several travellers who have made the trip do not recommended it. If coming from Saigon the costs for taxis, possible lost days waiting for the boat to depart in the windy seasons, transfer from Ben Dam post to the main town, all add up. Overall it is much better to fly. The boat will cost you the same or more.\n\nThere are several points worth noting about these services:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The Con Dao (Con Son) Airport is on the far north end of the island and a long way to anywhere else.
