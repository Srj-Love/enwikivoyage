There are whole Dong villages right behind the row of Chinese buildings along the streets.\n\nIf you start near the bus station (northern bank) you could take a taxi to the outdoor food market, which is on the other side of the river and west from the bridge. From there you can stroll back in 30 minutes or so.\n\nYou'll get a nice view of the traditional Dong settlements from the southern bank of the river. If you go up the stairs behind the houses across the bus station (for example) it's almost as if you're getting into a completely different, rural village within a few minutes.\n\nThere are also pagoda-like structures, which make for a good destination for exploratory hikes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nVisit ",{"type":"'''","value":["Basha"]},", a Miao hill village where the locals wear traditional clothes for daily life and grow topknots.
