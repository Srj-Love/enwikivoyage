It has long been regarded as one of the most beautiful places in the world. Its barren windswept landscape is compelling and inspiring. The blanket bog covering the region houses some beautiful and varied flora, and provides a contrast to the more green and fertile land of the midlands and the south.\nThe ancient mountains have been raked to their bones by long thawed glaciers, leaving patches of grey granite and jutting outwards, and potatoe rows still visible from the desperate times of the Great Famine. The fields are divided by hand-made stone walls, often collapsed. The Atlantic coast is dramatic and powerful, filling one with appreciation for the fear that the Irish men and women from this region must have felt when preparing for the trip across it.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nIrish is widely spoken in Connemara, and is the native language of all the locals. And will appreciate if you tried to speak a little Irish to the locals, however they will not expect you to speak in Irish. A person who asks \"Do you have any Irish?\" is inquiring whether you speak the language. You can get by, by using Irish to the locals, shops, the villages or anywhere. However if you are a holiday maker you don't have to use Irish to get by in Connemara as English would be understood by everyone, but you are more than welcome to use the language if you wish to be apart of the Gaeltacht spirit!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.buseireann.ie Bus Éireann"]}]},":  Route 420, from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Galway"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Clifden"]]}," winds through most of the major destinations."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.citylink.ie\/timetable-galw2clifden.htm Citylink"]}]}," has started a route to Clifden and Letterfrack from Galway."]},{"type":"*","value":[" For drivers, take the N59 or R336 northwest from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Galway"],["Galway City"]]},".

Known as Ireland’s most romantic Castle, Kylemore Abbey, located in Connemara, Co. Galway  is the No.1 tourist attraction in the West of Ireland. Perfect for a family day out and easily accessible from Galway or Mayo, It offers visitors scenic photographic opportunities as well as woodland walks, garden tours, fascinating history, beautiful architecture, ample shopping in the craft shop and tempting homemade delights in the restaurant and tea rooms.  Definitely one of the highlights of a tour in the area, but be sure to get there early enough to go see the Victorian Walled Garden -- there is a mandatory shuttle to the garden and if you miss the last one, too bad.  The abbey has a few rooms on display, and you can also walk down the lake to the church and mausoleum.
