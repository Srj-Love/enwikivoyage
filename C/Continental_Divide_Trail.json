Extending  3100 miles between Mexico and Canada, the trail traverses landscapes primarily on public lands within 50 miles of the geographic feature. This National Scenic Trail was established in 1978 through the authority of the National Trails System Act  (P.L. 90-543) and is one of the outstanding resources of the National Landscape Conservation System. The trail is a combination of dedicated trails and small roads and considered 70% complete. Portions designated as uncompleted must be traveled roadwalking on dirt or paved roads.\n",{"type":"===","value":["Thru hiking"]},"\nThru hiking is a term used in referring to hikers who complete long distance trails from end-to-end in a single trip. The ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pacific Crest Trail"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Appalachian Trail"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Continental Divide Trail"]]}," were the first three long-distance trails in the U.S. Successfully thru-hiking all of these three trails is known as ",{"type":"''","value":["the Triple Crown of Hiking"]},". Thru-hiking is a long commitment, usually taking between four and six months, that requires thorough preparation and dedication. Only about two dozen people a year attempt to hike the entire trail, taking about six months to complete it. As of 2008, no equestrians have managed to ride the entire trail in a single year, although several \"long riders\" have tried. German long distance rider Günter Wamser (on his way from Tierra del Fuego to Alaska), and Austrian Sonja Endlweber (who joined him for the rest of the journey from Mexico) managed to complete the tour with four Bureau of Land Management mustangs in three summers 2007–2009.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=The Continental Divide Trail Coalition"],["url=http:\/\/www.continentaldividetrail.org\/"],["email=info@continentaldividetrail.org"],["address=P.O.

It is important to begin regular walks in the months and weeks leading up to the thru-hike, beginning with low-impact day-hikes in easy terrain while carrying a minimum of weight. When these day-hikes become nearly effortless, increase the distance and include several multi-day hikes that require a full backpack with food, water and gear. In addition, hilly terrain should be incorporated as soon as possible in order to build up strength in the muscles required for climbs and descents. Performing regular hikes that continually push the body's current limits will not only toughen the body but will also go a long way toward mentally preparing oneself for the constant strain on body and mind.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["Thirsty?"],["Trail users are responsible for their own water.

Many experienced hikers have run dry."]]},"\nPreparing financially and logistically are also essential to a successful thru-hike. The cost of a hike will range from several hundred dollars a month on the low end to upwards of a thousand dollars a month for the high end. Each person has a different minimum level of comfort and nourishment; it is vital to discover what one's own level is as early as possible and to make supply arrangements accordingly. Study the route and identify towns that will serve as likely resupply centers and map out distances between post offices. An experienced thru-hiker resupplies his or her dry goods every 10-14 days, either through the post offices' general delivery drop-box system or through local purchases. The average thru-hiker plans for six to eight months before the actual hike. In a few cases, the CDT passes through or near towns and resorts where supplies can be purchased. In other cases the trail users may need to get off the trail and travel to a town. \n\nMuch of this info is available in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wilderness backpacking"]]}," travel section, but genearlly equipment should be purchased well in advance of the CDT start date and should be used as many times as possible to both allow the hiker to become familiar with the gear (backpacks adjusted properly, boots broken in, etc.) and to identify any broken, impractical or unsatisfactory items. Prospective thru-hikers should get in contact with local hiking clubs and solicit advice on what pieces of equipment are completely unnecessary, which are luxury items and which are essential. Different hikers have different philosophies on how much gear should be taken, from those in the \"lean and fast\" school of thought which advocates a minimum of everything - no stove, no tent, hiking sandals instead of boots and little else - to the \"slow and comfortable\" school which sacrifices speed and low weight for comfort. One should get as many opinions as possible and attempt hikes with various levels of gear until an acceptable amount of weight and speed has been achieved.\n\nFire permits are needed in many areas, and fire closures may exist during extremely dry times of year. Above certain elevations or in some areas fires are not permitted. Please check ahead of your trip to determine if a fire permit is needed and where it can be obtained.\n\nMany of the wilderness areas, National Parks and other special management areas require an overnight use permit.
