Star Alliance mileage for Air Rarotonga is not available.\n\nMost of the outer islands have only unpaved runways.  However, landing won't be much rougher than that of a paved runway.

It is more like Samoan, and some of it cannot even be understood by other Cook Islanders. But even there, English is spoken, albeit not widely.

Agriculture and tourism provide the economic base with major exports made up of copra and citrus fruit. Manufacturing activities are limited to fruit processing, clothing, and handicrafts. Trade deficits are offset by remittances from emigrants and by foreign aid, overwhelmingly from New Zealand. In the 1980s and 1990s, the country lived beyond its means, maintaining a bloated public service and accumulating a large foreign debt.

Locals generally get by with powdered or UHT milk.\n\nCalling home can cost a bundle, due to the need of having a large satellite dish and related equipment on each sparsely populated island.

Only the most acrophobic would be uncomfortable with this (they're plenty wide enough and not vertically \"open\"), but for children, the blind, and someone who's had too much to drink, the risk is extreme.  On the platforms, avoid getting too close to the edge, especially if you need a rest from climbing.\n\nMotorcycle and scooter accidents have caused injuries and fatalities in the past.
