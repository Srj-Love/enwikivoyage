In 1770 Captain James Cook landed on the banks of the Endeavour River repairing his ship ",{"type":"''","value":["Endeavour"]},", after it ran aground on the Great Barrier Reef.  A century later, in 1873, it became the port for the Palmer River Goldfields. Today it is billed as the ",{"type":"''","value":["gateway to the wilderness"]},". It offers Mountains, Outback terrain, as well as some of the top scuba diving around.  Although it still has well developed facilities, the town has more of a ",{"type":"''","value":["frontier feel"]},", as is vastly different to the resort towns further south along the coast.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" History "]},"\n\nThe first European to visit Cooktown was in 1770 when Captain Cook holed his ship on a reef just south of Cooktown and had to beach his ship at the mouth of the Endeavour River to undertake repairs.  He spent 48 days here.  Over 100 years later, Cooktown became one of the main gateways into Australia with the gold rush to the Palmer River. Grand permanent buildings were established, and the population boomed.  A railway was even constructed from Cooktown to the goldfields.\n\nWith the passing of the goldrush days, and a decline in shipping, Cooktown went into decline.  The town was frequently cut off by flooding in the wet, and the gravel road to Cooktown was washed out frequently.  Cooktown became a victim of its isolation.\n\nThe visit of the Queen Elizabeth II to Cooktown in 1970 still rates highly in the history of the town.\n\nThe sealed road made it to Cooktown in the 1990s, bringing with it a small resurgence in the fortunes of the town, with the arrival of tourism.  The town's population has never recovered to the level of the goldrush days, but today is slowly increasing.  \n\nThe place is called Gungardie in the language of the Guugu Yimithirr, and has had a continuous occupation by indigenous Australians stretching back thousands of years. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Geography "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Cooktown.jpg"],["thumb"],["Cooktown viewed from Grassy Hill"]]},"\nThe town itself is on the banks of the Endeavour River estuary, although only a few kilometres overland from the ocean.\n\nThere is an amazing natural environment that surrounds the area. From the Great Barrier Reef to the rainforests of the World Heritage Wet Tropics and the savannahs of Cape York.   Cooktown is a great base to explore this these renowned areas.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Climate "]},"\n\nCooktown is well inside the tropics, experiences the seasonal monsoon in summer, and in general has warm and dry winters.  There are a couple of weeks a year in winter when the weather can get cooler and rain is more common, usually around the beginning of July.  The locals will tell you that Cooktown has a couple of weeks of winter a year.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cairns"]]}," is probably the main access point for Cooktown, with an international airport, and good bus and train connections around Australia.

The drive to Cooktown from Cairns is easy.  The trip takes around 3 hours, is well signposted and hard to get lost.  The driving challenges begin north of here. \n\nThere is a unsealed dry-weather road that cuts through the Daintree National Park following the coast.  It offers better scenery, but not usually a quicker trip.
