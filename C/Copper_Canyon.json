[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Copper Canyon"]}," (Spanish: ",{"type":"''","value":["Barranca del Cobre"]},") is a canyon system in the Sierra Tarahumara in the southwestern part of the state of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chihuahua (state)"],["Chihuahua"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mexico"]]},". \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThe system of canyons here is larger and deeper than the Grand Canyon in the neighboring United States, although the Grand Canyon is larger overall than any of the individual canyons of the Copper Canyon system.  Though the area would be Mexico's star national park, it thus far has no official status as a park as efforts to make it so have been hampered by disagreements between loggers and the native Raramuri.\n\nThis area is rich in biodiversity, cultural history, and is the site of a growing tourist infrastructure. The town of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Creel"]]}," is probably the most popular gateway to the canyonlands. But the town of Hidalgo de Parall to the south of Chihuahua City is a good alternative and is useful for exploring the largely overlooked ",{"type":"'''","value":["Sinforosa Canyon"]},". Within the canyons lie the towns of Batopilas and Urique. Life moves slower in these towns, and it can be hard to imagine you are in the same country that counts Mexico City, Acapulco, and Cancun among its attractions. Shops and restaurants tend to be simple affairs that open late and close early. That does not prevent them from being very charming and the small towns in the canyons are great places to slow down and unwind. There are historic Catholic churches often run by Jesuit missionaries from other parts of the Latin World. But the real attraction of the canyonlands is the natural splendor of the area. There are numerous waterfalls and hot springs hidden away in the backcountry. These are reached by hiking, horseback, or guided treks with burros. Camping out under the stars is wonderful on the countless sandbars that line the area rivers. The area does see other travelers and tourists but is hardly overrun. Rather, the small towns seem to have the right balance; enough other visitors so you can meet hiking partners and put together expeditions. But not so many that getting away from all traces of civilization is anywhere near difficult.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nThe area was mostly uninhabited before European arrival. Once Spaniards began forming ranches on the plains of Chihuahua the Raramuri began moving back into the canyons. The almost militant Jesuits soon followed. The Jesuits were forced out of Mexico after the Spanish crown discovered they were smuggling gold back to Europe; leaving the Raramuri in peace. Franciscans replaced the Jesuits throughout much of Mexico but never succeeded in penetrating the Sierra Tarahumara. Today there are a few Jesuit missionaries back in the area. The lack of any church leadership in the area for hundreds of years resulted in the hybrid Christian-traditional religious beliefs that the Raramuri exhibit today.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\nVery little scientific study has been done on the wildflowers since the late 1800s and early 1900s until recently.  A visitor to the Copper Canyon region in 2004 saw many beautiful flowers but discovered that no field guide had ever been written for the Copper Canyon so she decided to write one.   After three more trips to do the research, she found a botanist to work with her who then identified the plants and a professor from a university in Chihuahua translated the text into Spanish so the guide would be bilingual.  In July 2009 the first ever ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.coppercanyonwildflowers.com Field Guide to the Wildflowers of Mexico’s Copper Canyon Region by Linda J. Ford"]}," was published.  She created a very user friendly guide so when the casual visitor is touring the canyon in the months of September and October when the wildflowers are in bloom, he or she will have the opportunity to identify over 140 different species of wildflowers.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nThe most comfortable time to go is early spring to early summer and late summer to late fall.\n\nBecause of the difference in elevation from over 8,000 feet at the high plateau and canyon rims to the bottom of the canyons at 1,800 feet, four very distinct climate zones with a wide variety of vegetation have resulted.  \n\nIn the highlands is the Madrean Conifer Forest with fir, pines, Douglas fir, and red Madroño trees.  Going down in elevation, there is the Pine-Oak Woodland with pine, live oak, and agave.  Continuing down, next comes the Arid-Tropical Deciduous Thorn Forest with scrub oak, mesquite, and cardon.  The last zone located at the bottom of the canyons is the Tropical-Subtropical Riparian Forest that has fig, sycamore, ceibas, grasses, reeds, and palms.\n\nDuring the winter months, the temperature can drop below freezing at the rim of the canyon while down in the canyon, the climate is subtropical.  During the summer months, afternoon rains often occur.  As a result of these rains, the streams and waterfalls begin to flow and the vegetation including wildflowers come to life in late August, September, and early October.  In addition to abundant wildflowers in the fall, the temperatures are also more moderate at the rim as well as in the canyon that time of year.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Chihuahua al Pacífico Railroad"]},", known as ",{"type":"''","value":["El Chepe"]},", is a rail line that runs from the Pacific coast at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Los Mochis"]]}," to the city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chihuahua"]]},", passing through the canyonlands. While the train ride is lauded as one of the most spectacular in the world, the reality is that the really scenic parts of the journey are between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["El Fuerte"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Creel"]]},", especially between El Fuerte and Bahucivo where the train rapidly ascends many thousands of feet. The route from Los Mochis headed eastwards is more scenic because the westward train often passes through the most scenic areas after nightfall. This is really only an issue in the winter when days are short or if the 2nd class train is running way behind schedule. Regardless, neither direction offers direct views of the canyon itself. First and second class are available in separate trains, with the first class train leaving earlier. First class is mostly for foreign tourists and costs twice the rate of 2nd class, but allows you to hop on and off, whereas 2nd class tickets must be entirely used up in one day. 1st class tickets should be purchased in advance through a travel agency to avoid disappointment, while 2nd class tickets can be purchased on the train from the conductor.\n\nIn addition as of late February 2009, a first class train leaves from Chihuahua AND Los Mochis every morning, whereas the second class train only leaves from each station 3 times a week(aka it will depart from Los Mochis one night and Chihuahua the next, and take 1 day off per week).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nCopper Canyon is well served by bus service.

Farthest off the beaten path and probably nicest of all are the Owerabo hot springs deep within the Barranca del Cobre (Copper Canyon).
