The Ningaloo is a true fringing reef.  The reef extends from the land up to a few kilometres out to sea, and much of it is accessible from the coast.  Chances are you can find a part of the reef for your own exploration, grab a snorkel and stay as long as you like.  Snorkel as the sun goes down over the ocean.  There is a large variety of marine life, tropical fish, lots of reef sharks, rays, and soft corals and sponges.  There are some colourful hard corals too.  By contrast the Great Barrier Reef is larger, and the northernmost parts have more hard corals.  But to see it you will have to pay to stay or visit a coral cay, or take a boat out to the reef.  The boats tend to go to the same parts of the reef, and these well visited parts tend to be damaged, with less variety of marine life, and bleached corals.  It's may be best not to compare, and enjoy each destination for yourself.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Snorkelling"]}," - The snorkelling at Coral Bay is right off the beach.
