The 3,730 acres of Bureau of Land Management land was established as a Utah state park in 1963. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\nStarting about 15,000 years ago, piles of coral pink colored sand blew through a notch between the Moquith Mountains and Moccasin Mountain.  The wind tossed it into the valley where it now lies in drifts of sand in this southern Utah state park. The reddish grains of sand come from the eroding Navajo sandstone, thus giving the dunes its name. Hills of dunes are vegetation free, and other sections are dotted with juniper, pine trees, bushes and wildflowers.  From the sandy hills of the park there is a breathtaking view of the Vermillion Cliffs.  The skies above are brilliantly clear.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:coralpinksanddunes2.jpg"],["thumb"],["left"],["300px"],["Coral Pink Sand Dunes"]]}," \n\nIn the lower vegetation zone of the high desert,  pinon pines and junipers thrive, thrown in among the trees and sand are a spackling of wildflowers, grasses and cactus.   Ponderosa Pines peer down from the higher elevations in the distinct, upper vegetation zone.  The animals search out pools of water where they can survive.  Odd enough the tiger salamander and toads live at the park.  There are also small mammals such as jackrabbits, kangaroo rats, fox, coyote, bobcats, mountain lions, ring-tailed cat and mule deer. A few birds and reptiles make their home at the park including the a few harmless snakes, the bald eagle, peregrine falcon and the golden eagle.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nThe summers are hot and the winters are cool at the arid dunes.  In the summer expect day time temperatures around 90 degrees with occasional thunderstorms.  In the winter the snows usually begins in December and can continue, off and on, until April with a quick snow storm occasionally in May.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:coralpinksanddunes3.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["300px"],["Coral Pink Sand Dunes Visitor Center"]]}," \n\nThe road to the signed turn-off to the park (Yellow Jacket Road) is located 3 miles from Mount Carmel Junction, off Highway 89.
