Due to its status as a border town, it has often suffered the effects of warfare throughout its long history. Nowadays though it is a peaceful country village, bypassed by traffic on the main A69 trunk road and with numerous shops and cafes among the old stone buildings, a pleasant place to while away some time.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Getting there"]},"\n\nCorbridge is located 16km west of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Newcastle-upon-Tyne"]]}," and 6km east of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hexham"]]},". It is served by trains on the Newcastle to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Carlisle"]]}," railway line and lies just off the main A69 Newcastle to Carlisle trunk road. \n\nDrivers with time to spare approaching from the north or south should consider using the ancient (don't worry it has been modernised to modern A-road standards!) A68 ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Darlington"]]}," - ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Edinburgh"]]}," road, known since Roman times as ",{"type":"''","value":["Dere Street"]},". The section from Tow Law - Corbridge - Otterburn sees relatively little traffic (lorry-drivers tend to avoid it due to the steep gradients), and is the \"classic\" Roman road, scorning the topography of the landscape to form long straights with sharp peaks and troughs, and offering some spectacular views as it traverses the high moorlands. Do heed the warning signs if using this road - there are countless blind summits on those long straights and when the bends do appear, they can be pretty tight.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Corbridge Roman Site"],["url=http:\/\/www.english-heritage.org.uk\/daysout\/properties\/corbridge-roman-town-hadrians-wall\/"],["email="],["address=Corchester Lane, NE45 5NT"],["lat=54.978458"],["long=-2.028564"],["directions=1\/2 mile NW of Corbridge, follow the signs"],["phone=+44 1434 632349"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=1 Apr-30 Sep: 10am-5.30pm 7 days; 1 Oct-1 Nov: 10am-4pm 7 days; 2 Nov-31 Mar: 10am-4pm Sat & Sun"],["price=adults £5.40, children £3.20, concessions £4.90"],["content=Fortunately for historians, archaeologists, and those of us with a passing interest, this garrison town was abandoned after Roman rule in Britain collapsed.
