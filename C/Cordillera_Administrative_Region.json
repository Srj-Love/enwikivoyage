The Cordillera region encompasses most of the areas within the Cordillera Central mountain range of Luzon, the largest range in the country. \n\nThe region is home to indigenous cultures of different tribal ethnicity such as the Igorot, Kalingan, Ifugaos, Kankanaeys, Illian, Baliwon and many others spread in isolated communities in the various parts of the region. Despite differences in tribal ethnicity, the Cordillera peoples have commonalities in costumes, music, dances and even customs.\n\nIn the central part of the Cordillera Mountain Range, rice terraces abounds - from Ifugao to Mountain Province, famous of which is the Banaue Rice Terraces. The UNESCO Heritage Site declared five clusters of rice terraces in various towns in Ifugao. Other hidden rice terraces can found in Natonin, Mountain Province. Scenic terrains of cornfields can be found in Paracelis, Mountain Province, a town next to Natonin.\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Banaue.jpg"],["thumb"],["Banaue Rice Terraces"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Provinces"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Abra"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Benguet"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Kalinga"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Apayao"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Mountain Province"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Ifugao"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Baguio"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mount Pulag National Park"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nOn July 15, 1987, Executive Order No. 220 was issued creating the Cordillera Administrative Region. It is composed of provinces which used to be part of the Old Mountain Province. Republic Act No. 6766 was passed on October 23, 1989. It provided for an Organic Act for the Cordillera Autonomous Region. It mandates the creation of an autonomous government to be headed by a Regional Governor. It creates a Regional Assembly that will enact laws of regional application and a regional judiciary composed of a supreme court and lower courts. The act also directs the proposed autonomous government in the Cordillera to exercise governmental functions, including the raising of taxes, but excluding defense, foreign affairs and monetary functions. However, the Constitution requires that the act has to be ratified by the people in a plebiscite. It was originally scheduled on December 27 of the same year but was reset to January 30 the following by virtue of the Commission on Elections. During the said plebiscite, it was only Ifugao which voted favorably.\n\nRepublic Act No. 8438 dated December 22, 1997 created the Cordillera Autonomous Region. In January 1998, a group of lawyers challenged the constitutionality of the act. A plebiscite held on March 9 of the same year was held and invalidated the act. The region was created but reduced to a regular administrative region.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nDespite being centrally located between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ilocos Region"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cagayan Valley Region"]]},", the region has limited entry points from neighboring regions and provinces due to its topographic configuration mostly of steep slopes and mountain ranges. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\nThe regions only operating airport is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Loakan Airport"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Baguio City"]]},".
