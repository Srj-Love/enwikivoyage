For that, you should go to the center of new Corinth and then ask people where the bus stop is. The bus stop should be located around a café and people there will tell you when the next bus goes (usually you will be waiting there a little). The bus has something something similar to \"ARXAIA\" written on it and takes you to the old part. You can buy a ticket in the bus (1,60 €). It is a good idea to stay in the bus a little while it is going through the old Corinth, because it gives you a nice, cheap tour.
