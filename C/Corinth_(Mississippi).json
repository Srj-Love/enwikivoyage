Albert Sidney Johnston met with Gen. Braxton Bragg in his bedchambers at the Verandah House to officially sign Order No. 8 to launch the Confederate counter offensive against the Union army that ended in the Battle of Shiloh, April 6–7, 1862. Throughout the war, generals from both the Confederacy and the Union were quartered in this house. Following the war, the Corinth Female Academy occupied the house for a short period of time. It was then purchased by the William Peyton Curlee, one of the founders of the Curlee Clothing Company. After Mr. Curlee’s death of yellow fever, Mrs. Curlee, a descendent of Daniel Boone, sold the house to the Leroy Montgomery, who raised a large family in the home.
