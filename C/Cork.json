Many of the wider streets, such as St Patrick's Street, the South Mall and the Grand Parade, are actually built on former river channels.

There are upwards of thirty bridges over the two channels. This, combined with the one-way traffic system, can make the centre a little bit confusing for first-time visitors.

During the night caution should be taken, as in any situation involving large numbers of people and alcohol. Late night fighting and anti-social behaviour are more common in Ireland and Britain than in elsewhere in Western Europe and Asia. However, as in any city the vast majority of people are out simply to enjoy themselves.\n\nSensible and vigilant behaviour when out late at night should mean that any trouble is avoided. If your safety feels compromised, approach any of the many police or doormen in the city centre, who will be happy to provide assistance. There is virtually no guncrime in Cork, even the general police don't carry guns, so there is no need to worry about firearm violence.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Blarney Castle"]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Blarney"]]},".
