On the contrary, by foot or by train, otherwise by foot and by boat.\nThe Genoa - La Spezia line stops in all the villages along the coast and the boats make regular shuttle runs between La Spezia, Lerici, Portovenere, Levanto and Sestri Levante.\nAnd then by foot, through the Mediterranean bush, between heaven and sea.\nIn fact, the zone of the Cinque Terre is crossed by a knitted mesh of footpaths. The coastal footpath links all five villages, allowing you to be able to hike from the first village to the last village in five hours. Therefore, it could also be ideal to do a single hike or perhaps the more binding along the crest or towards the Sanctuaries: routes or footpaths are numerous, delightful and interesting; they which give a general idea of the area and also offer a brief insight into its exceptional cultural and natural beauty.\n\nTaking the local commuter\/milk trains (they used to deliver milk and mail to the cities) to Vernazza from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Genova"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["La Spezia"]]}," is a magnificent experience.

Enjoy the Miele (honey flavored).\nStop by and have fresh anchovies and wine with Mario, the owner of enoteca I'll Pirun.  The music here is wonderful blend of jazz and blues.
