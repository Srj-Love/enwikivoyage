Cornwall is increasingly becoming a popular destination for those interested in cultural tourism due to its long association with visual and written arts, and enormous wealth of archaeology. Its mining heritage has recently been recognised by the United Nations (UNESCO).  Over thirty percent of the county is designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) giving it national status and protection. Cornwall has always been fiercely proud of its Celtic identity, and for many residents their Cornish identity supersedes their Englishness or Britishness.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities, towns and villages"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Cornwall map.png"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Map of Cornwall"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Cities"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Truro (England)"],["Truro"]]}," - Cornwall's main administrative centre and only city"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Towns"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bodmin"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bude"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Callington"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Camborne"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Falmouth (Cornwall)"],["Falmouth"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fowey"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hayle"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Helston"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Launceston (Cornwall)"],["Launceston"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Liskeard"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Looe"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lostwithiel"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Marazion"]]}," - Home of St Micheals Mount (Pictured)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mevagissey"]]}," - picturesque hillside fishing village"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Newlyn"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Newquay"]]}," - surf capital of the UK"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Padstow"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Penzance"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Porthleven"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Redruth"]]}," - world capital of tin mining"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saltash"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["St Agnes"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["St Austell"]]}," - largest town in the county and home to the Eden Project, the world's largest greenhouse"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["St Columb Major"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["St Ives"]]}," - home to a branch of the Tate Gallery"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["St. Just in Penwith"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wadebridge"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Villages"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Altarnun"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Blisland"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boscastle"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cawsand"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" Constantine"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Crackington Haven"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Delabole"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Illogan"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Luxulyan"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Minions"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mousehole"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pendeen"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Perranporth"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Polmear"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Polperro"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Polzeath"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Port Isaac"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["St Buryan"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" St Keverne"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["St Levan"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["St Merryn"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tintagel"]]}," - legendary birthplace of King Arthur and seat of the Kings of Cornwall"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Veryan"]]}," - Carne Beacon is one of the largest burial mounds or ‘barrows’ in Britain."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zennor"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other Destinations"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Land's End"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lizard"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tamar Valley"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bodmin Moor"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cape Cornwall"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Helford River"]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThe modern English name of the Duchy is thought to be derived from its old Celtic name, Kernou, or the Horn, from its projecting promontories; that it was Latinised to Cornovia or Cornubia; that when the Saxons gave the name of Wealas (foreigners) to the Britons, they distinguished those who had retired into Kernou or Cornubia, by the name of Cornu-wealas; and their country was thus called Cornuwall or Cornwall ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.british-history.ac.uk\/report.aspx?compid=50606"]},". Cornwall is called Kernow in the Cornish language and many signs have Cornish language descriptions on them. However, everybody in Cornwall speaks English as their first language. The Cornish language is recognised internationally and has government funding, a thriving community of speakers and publishers and is making a successful come back, with the number of fluent speakers now increasing, being in the thousands.\n\nRecent polls place Cornish identity amongst young people at around 40% regarding themselves as Cornish rather than English, with calls for a Cornish assembley or government by some. Some might take offense to being called English, though most will take it in good jest.\n\nA common, somewhat derogatory term for tourists is ",{"type":"''","value":["emmet"]},", a Cornish Dialect word  meaning ant. The Cornish word for ant is actually ",{"type":"''","value":["murrian"]},".  Be aware of locals recommending \"Porthemmet Beach\" - it simply means 'tourist beach', and it doesn't exist.\n\nThe Cornish have several patron saints rather than those recognised in other parts of the United Kingdom (Andrew, George, David etc.) but the pre-eminent one is Saint Piran whose flag, black with a white cross, can be seen all across the Duchy and flown from not only private homes but also Government and public buildings as well as in most towns. Saint Piran's Day is widely celebrated on March 5, not only in Cornwall but amongst the Cornish diaspora across the globe.\n\nThe stereotype of the Cornish as 'inbred' and 'backward' is a misconception and if repeated to a local is likely to cause embarrassment and offence (and perhaps a smack). Cornwall is generally quite ethnically homogeneous in comparison to most areas of the UK, and then Cornish people tend to hold onto traditional morals and lifestyles. They are also slightly more conservative than the UK as a whole and very patriotic. Cornwall has a strong Protestant heritage, where Methodism is the main denomination. Nearly every village has at least one Methodist church: some small villages have more than one Methodist church and no church from any other denomination. It's common to be driving along a backroad and find a Methodist church in the middle of nowhere, with no houses or settlements in the vicinity or in a tiny hamlet of a couple houses, but it still holds regular Sunday services with good attendance.\n\nCornwall was a contributor to the industrial revolution, famous particularly for its tin-mining and has produced major writers, artists, scientists and musicians to current times. The Cornish are extremely proud of their history and heritage pre-dating the arrival of the English Anglo-Saxons in Britain, and many Cornish people are loyal to their Duchy. You may even see some Cornish people wearing kilts and playing Cornish pipes at cultural and other gatherings and Cornwall is recognised as a separate nation by many international organisations. One such popular organisation is ",{"type":"''","value":["Gorsedh Kernow"]},", aimed at promoting Cornish culture and festivals such as Gorsedd.\n\nCornwall has a small but developing lesbian and gay community.

Dolly Pentreath of Mousehole, who died in 1777, was the last person thought to have been monolingual in Cornish. The publication of Henry Jenner's \"Handbook of the Cornish Language\" in 1904 caused a resurgence of interest in the Cornish language, and it is now increasingly used. Several thousand Cornish people speak the language fluently, and several young people have grown up bilingual in both Cornish and English.
