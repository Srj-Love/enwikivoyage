The route is only two hours. Alternatively get off the highway at Yoloso and take a collectivo up the hill for 5bol (15 mins).\n\n\nFrom La Paz to Coroico you can also do \"The Bike Ride\" - the so-called, \"Death Road.\" Look for the agency that allows you to bring your backpack along.

It is a road carved in the mountains, with the idea of having a train connection. It never did function, but as a train needs relatively flat terrain, it's a much more accessible option for people not used to walking. It can be done in two or three days, but come well prepared: the first two days you will not encounter any villages.\n\n30 minutes away from Coroico there is a community project named ",{"type":"'''","value":["“El Vagante”"]}," (http:\/\/www.elvagante.com) that offers ",{"type":"'''","value":["canyoning and trekking"]}," for $40 to $60 per day. Canyoning involves rappelling down 8 natural waterfalls with pure, fresh, crystal clear water in the middle of the Yungas Jungle. You can also enjoy trekking through the Yungas  tropics appreciating nature and fauna, breathing healthy full of oxygen air.\n\nFor free trekking you can walk up to the phone masts, when you get to the church you could go left which takes you on an easy flat path toward three waterfalls (first 2 not for swimming as they are the local water supply). The views of the valley are amazing and there are lots of wild flowers and the odd coca field. You could also go right at the church to the top of the hill (the highest point in the area). \n\nCXC ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.mtbcoroico.co.cc"]}," offers ",{"type":"'''","value":["mountain bike"]}," tours around Coroico for beginners to experts.
