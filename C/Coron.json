It is the largest town on the island and has the largest share of accommodations.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Background"]},"\nCoron is both the name of the largest town on the island of Busuanga, and the name of a different, smaller island just offshore. The area is famous for its World War II wreck diving, and the site has been named in many lists of top dive spots in the world. In September 1944, a fleet of Japanese ships hiding in the harbor were sunk in a daring raid by the US navy. The result is around ten well preserved underwater shipwrecks surrounded with coral reef.\n\nThere are also attractions on Coron Island itself. There are many beautiful bleach white sand beaches, mostly tiny and surrounded by large limestone cliffs and wildlife. Barracuda and Kayangan lakes are both stunning locations, and good for snorkeling, and the island is the ancestral domain of an indigenous tribe who are managing the island in a sustainable way and keeping outsiders at a distance and offshore at night.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nThe first inhabitants of Coron were the Tagbanuas who belong to the second wave of Indonesians who migrated to this area some 5,000 years ago.  They were a nomadic, seafaring people, living mainly by fishing and subsistence agriculture.  Although they are now sedentary (with the young using cell phones, etc.), they maintain many of their old customs, traditions and beliefs. Today, the Tagbanuas remain the dominant if not entire population of Coron.\n\nIn 1902 that Coron was registered as a town and the name of the town was officially changed from Penon de Coron to Coron.\n \nFrom 1939 to the outbreak of World War II, the municipality experienced the mining boom.  Labor shifted from farming to mining.  In July 1942, the Japanese occupied the mining camps and resumed operation of the manganese mines.  On September 24, 1944, a group of Japanese ships were sunk by American warplanes in Coron waters as the ships retreated from Manila Bay.  To this day, about 10 or 12 of these World War II Japanese shipwrecks comprise what is considered one of the best dive sites in the world.\n \nIn 1947, large scale deep sea fishing was introduced to Coron, and the town experienced another boom, a fishing boom.  The population increased, as many people from Luzon and the Visayas came to work either as fishermen or miners.\n \nOn June 17, 1950, Busuanga was officially created as a separate municipality from Coron and in 1954, Coron was further reduced by the official creation of the Municipality of Linapacan.  On September 12, 1992, Coron was finally reduced by the official creation of the Municipality of Culion.\n\nIn the past, Coron was virtually unknown outside of Palawan. It remains a small, quaint fishing town with laid back charm but with increasing media exposure it is growing, slowly but steadily,  Coron has taken an important position in the tourism industry. In the past decade, there has been a rapid influx of scuba divers and other tourists coming in, making tourism the major industry player in Coron today.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Mapframe"],["11.99747"],["120.20554"],["zoom=17"],["height=470"],["width=470"],["layer=OP"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Fly into Busuanga from Manila with ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.airphilexpress.com\/ Airphil Express"]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cebupacificair.com\/ Cebu Pacific"]}," ."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Airport to town: Van transfers P150\/person, P1500 for the whole van"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["[2GO Travel]"]}," stops in Coron on their way to Puerto Princesa.
