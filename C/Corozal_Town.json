The easiest way to reach the ruins is by boat, usually hireable at the main dock east of downtown, but the site can also be reached by road.  Follow the Cerros Ruins signs on the road to Copper Bank and Sarteneja, but be careful, it is a ~10-mile dirt road which can be very washed out following bad weather, especially hurricanes.  The direction to Cerros may also not be terribly well marked, but if you take the left path at major forks in the road, you should find it fairly easily.  Again, hiring a boat in Corozal will definitely be quicker and easier, but taking the road will give you a chance to ride one of the hand-cranked ferries seen throughout Belize (no charge for the ferry, but feel free to tip or buy juice or snacks the ferry pilots have for sale)."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\nThe town has a fairly wide selection of shops, it is possible to buy clothing, food, kitchen and garden equipment, electronic goods, bicycles and more.  During the day there is a market close to the bus station selling a variety of local products, such as fruit.\n\nThere are three banks in Corozal, two of them foreign with ATMs, but these will only accept Visa or Mastercard. The local 'Belize Bank' also has an ATM and will accept other cards such as Maestro, but it's reliability is questionable; you may end up having to wait inside the bank for an hour before they give you back your card and tell you its not working today. Within the banks you are likely to find very long queues.\n\nIt is possible to change Mexican and Belizean money on the street here, and this is legal and certainly safe if you do it next to the border checkpoint. You can also change money inside the customs office, but the rates are often less good, cash advances on credit cards are available here but a large \"handling\" fee is charged. If you are leaving the country and need to pay the exit tax it is a good idea to take money out in Corozal instead. Without a credit card you will have to withdraw money at the Belize Bank in Corozal or take out Mexican Pesos on the other side of the border, and change this into Belize dollars.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Eat "]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["June's Kitchen"]},", located on College Road, Home made Belizean Breakfast and Lunch daily.
