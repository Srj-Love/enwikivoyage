It is shaped like a tadpole, with its tail running eastward, and has a land area of 9 square kilometers. Along with Caballo Island (which lies 2 kilometers south of the tail's tip), it partially blocks the entrance of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Manila"]]}," Bay, and thus has strategic importance.\n\nBecause of its rocky landscape and the fortifications of Fort Mills, Corregidor Island is also known as \"The Rock\". Corregidor is 6 kilometers long and about 2.4 kilometers at its widest point. Its bulbous head, which points toward the South China Sea rises prominently to a large flat area called the Topside. This was the nerve center of the island during WWII and here were located the headquarters, barracks for enlisted personnel, officers' quarters, the traditional parade grounds, underground ordnance shops and the bulk of batteries that constituted the military strength of Corregidor. A small plateau that interrupts the upward slope from Bottomside to Topside is the Middleside and was the location of barracks for the enlisted men, a hospital, quarters for non-commissioned officers, a service club, and 2 schoolhouses. The Bottomside is the lower part of the island and is the neck that connects the head and the tail of the island and east of it is where the Malinta Tunnel can be found. The Malinta Tunnel, which is the last stronghold of the joint Philippine and American Military forces, is now home to a Light & Sound presentation by national artist Lamberto V. Avellana of the events that took place on the island during WWII. There were 23 batteries installed in Corregidor, consisting of 56 coastal guns and mortars. In addition, Corregidor had 13 anti-aircraft artillery batteries, 76 guns (28 3-inch and 48 50-caliber), and 10 60-inch Sperry searchlights. The longest range coastal pieces were the 2 12-inch (305 mm) guns of Batteries Hearn & Smith.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Brothers.JPG"],["thumb"],["upright 1.4"],["Brothers in Arms"]]},"\nSun Cruises, Inc.
