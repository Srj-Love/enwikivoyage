From there, you have several options. If you want to discover the coasts in the southern vicinity of Barcelona, you can take the Cercanias Line 2 sud, which is a commuter service, to villages like Sitges, Vilanova i la Geltrù, and Sant Vicenç de Calders (Coma-Ruga).\n\nIf you want to go to places that are more to the south, like Tarragona and Salou, you'll need to take the 'Media Distancia' lines 14, 15 or 16 for Tarragona, and 16 for Salou. These trains are more expensive than the commuter trains and are prised according to the amount of stations they call at. Slower, regularly stopping trains are called 'Regional' and faster services are called 'Regional Exprés' or 'Catalunya Exprés'.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nOutdoor sports, especially climbing.\n\nView maps on ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/alpinaut.com\/?center=41.353843945604126,0.9671401977539062 www.alpinaut.com"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Xanascat"]}," the National Network of ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.xanascat.cat Youth Hostels"]}," for all of Catalonia."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.pv-holidays.com\/scripts\/fiche_produit.php?id_ofr=345&id_sai_passe=2&date=2009-04-04&duree=7&code=BVL25 \"Pierre & Vacances - Bonavista Resort\""]},", +33 1 58 21 55 84, Located on the sun-blessed Costa Dorada, the Pierre & Vacances Bonmont resort enjoys a privileged location at the prestigious Bonmont golf course.
