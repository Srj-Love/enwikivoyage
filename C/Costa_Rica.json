Costa Rica requires Indian citizens to be in possession of a valid visa when they arrive. However, people of ANY nationality holding valid US, Canada, Japan, South Korea or Schengen visas do not need a prior visa. The only conditions being that the visa must be valid for 3 months and should be stamped in your passport. \n\nBefore traveling, verify the entry requirements currently in effect with TimaticWeb or with a Costa Rican consulate. If you have a somewhat unusual passport\/visa combinations, make sure to allow extra time for check in (especially if flying with a minor airline, like InterJet, which may not have a TimaticWeb subscription, or whose staff may not know how to use it). \n\nTechnically speaking, the entry requirements include having a return ticket. If you are doing a multi-country trip, and the return air ticket to your home country is from an adjacent country, such as Panama or Nicaragua, that would usually satisfy the immigration authorities and the airline check-in staff; nonetheless, if travleing on an itinerary like this (especially with an \"unusual\" passport), it may be safer to purchase a fully refundable ticket directly from Costa Rica, and cancel it once no longer needed.\n\nCosta Rica requires valid Yellow fever certificate if arriving from countries where that disease is prevalent (such as Panama and most South American countries). If such is not presented you would not be allowed to enter\/board the flight. At Bogota airport - if you have certificate you can have it emailed to the airline and then proceed to the local vaccination authority for duplicate certificate to be issued free of charge. The critical part is to get the printed version on time. If you don't have certificate or cannot get it on time you will probably be approached by friendly police officers to arrange such for a fee. Keep in mind that the date of the vaccination should be at least 10 days prior entering the country from which you are flying.\n\nAnother way to get to Costa Rica that many people are unaware of is traveling by car and driving the Pan-American highway that stretches from Alaska all the way to the southern tip of South America (with a gap in the Darien Gap, in Panama\/Columbia) - it is credited with being 27,197 miles long and passes right through Costa Rica.\n\nOne can also visit Costa Rica by a cruise ship; the harbor is in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Puerto Limón"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Juan Santamaría Airport"]}," (SJO) is located close to the cities Alajuela, Heredia and the capital San José.\n\nSJO is currently under remodelling, and in July 2009 its operation was taken over by the same organization that runs the airports in Houston, Texas.

Highway #1) passes through innumerable small towns, the speed frequently drops to 50 or even 30 km\/h as you suddenly find yourself in a school zone.  Most of the highway is not divided.  A common indicator that a police checkpoint is ahead is that oncoming cars flick their lights at you.   New laws that went into effect in 2010 have greatly increased the amount of tickets; it used to be a max of about $20; there are now tickets that exceed $400 for attempting to bribe an officer, and other big-ticket tickets for drunken driving, speeding, and other illegal actions including talking on a cell phone and not using seat belts. Be nice to the police if you are pulled over because, as a result of the new laws, it is possible for them to \"throw the book\" at you, although they generally do not. This could mean citing you for minor offenses that the new laws have instituted, such as the requirement that every car carry an emergency kit.  New laws have also now enforced a 3 year prison sentence for driving with a 0.8 blood alcohol level and a US $480 fine. Driving over 20kph over the speed limit is a US $310 and losing 20 points. Police now tend to target tourists because they think that Costa Ricans don't have the money to pay the big tickets---and they're right. The police themselves earn about $500 per month, and that happens to be the average monthly wage in Costa Rica.\n\nThe good news is that there is a brand new highway known as Autopista Del Sol (Highway of the Sun) that stretches from the beaches around Orotina all the way into San Jose. This highway is smooth as U.S. or European highways, in fact it was constructed by a company that is based in Spain. There are tolls along this highway but if you travel the entire stretch it will still only come out to be a few dollars in total. 2011 update: unfortunately, problems have been found with this highway and parts of it are sometimes closed for repairs.\n\nMany Costa Rican roads are in terrible shape, and short distances can take a very long time. Even the only road in and out of popular tourist destinations are riddled with major potholes.  To avoid potholes, drivers will often snake through the left and right lanes, usually returning to the right when oncoming traffic approaches.  While this may seem erratic, you can become quickly accustomed to it.  If you see a tree branch or pole poking out of the middle of a road, that is a \"sign\" that there is a deep sinkhole, pothole or manhole ",{"type":"''","value":["without a cover"]},".  ",{"type":"'''","value":["Stay away from it"]},".\n\nDriving at night is ",{"type":"'''''","value":["highly"]}," inadvisable, due to the unpredictability of road conditions and lack of safety features such as guard rails on the many hairpin turns in the hills.  To put safety in perspective, Costa Rica's per capita traffic death rate is comparable to that of the United States, but there are undeniably many hazards, and they are likely to be unfamiliar ones.\n\nMany roads are unpaved, and even the paved roads have lots of unpaved sections and washed out or unfinished bridges. Bridges are often only wide enough for one vehicle; one direction usually has priority.  Do not expect to get anywhere quickly; supposed three-hour journeys can turn into ",{"type":"'''","value":["five or more hours"]}," easily: there are always slow cars\/buses\/trucks on the road. This causes a lot of crazy driving, which you begin to emulate if you are in-country for more than a day. The government does not seem to be fixing the infrastructure well (or at all!); 50 km\/hr is good over unpaved roads.  Some hotels located in the mountains require a four-wheel-drive vehicle to reach the destination. Call ahead. This is more for the ground clearance than the quality of the road.  Four-wheel-drive vehicles are widely available at the car rentals near the airport, but call ahead.\n\nNavigation can prove challenging. Road signs are relatively few, and those that do exist can be inaccurate.  It is recommended that you have a good road map with the small towns listed, since road signs will often only indicate the next town, not the direction of the next major city.  Towns generally do not have town-limit signs; it is best to look at the names on the roadside food stores and restaurants to determine the place you are passing.  Stop and ask, practice your Spanish.  The center of town is usually a public park with a Catholic church across from it.\n\nThere are no formal street addresses in Costa Rica, but two ",{"type":"''","value":["informal"]}," systems exist.  The first (often used in tourist information) indicates the road on which the establishment is located (",{"type":"''","value":["e.g."]},", \"6th Avenue\"), together with the crossroad interval (",{"type":"''","value":["e.g."]},", \"between 21st and 23rd Streets\").  In practice, street signs are virtually non-existent, and locals do not even know the name of the street they are on.  The second system, which is much more reliable and understood by locals, is known as the \"Tico address\", usually involving an oriented distance (",{"type":"''","value":["e.g."]},", \"100 meters south, 50 meters east\") from a landmark (",{"type":"''","value":["e.g."]},", \"the cathedral\").\n\nIt is worth noting the particular road naming system in San Jose. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Avenues run east-west"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["streets run north-south"]},".  The numbering is less straighforward. Starting at Central Avenue going south are 2nd, 4th, 6th Avenue, etc. while going north are 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.  Streets use even numbers going west, and odd numbers going east.  This means that if you are at 7th Avenue and 4th Street, and looking for 6th Avenue and 5th Street, you are on the wrong side of town.\n\nGas stations are full-service and the guys there are very cool about taking dollars or Colón(es). The interesting thing is that Costa Rica is small so you do not burn a lot of gas getting places, even though it seems like forever. Costa Rica is also a land of traffic circles, so people from Europe should have no problem, but North Americans should make sure they know how they work.  The gas stations really are full-service, and you can have your oil checked, water filled, and tire pressure topped off.  The state owns a gasoline company and the private companies raise their prices to the level of the state-set price. It is recommended to always use super gas and ",{"type":"'''''","value":["not"]}," regular; the ",{"type":"'''","value":["regular gas is soiled"]},". If you use the \"regular\" gas, you will have to change the gas filter and clean the injectors after 5000 miles.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nThere are bus services from the neighboring countries of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Panama"],["Panamá"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nicaragua"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Honduras"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["El Salvador"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mexico"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guatemala"]]},".\n\nThere is an extensive network of bus routes within the country with reasonable fares. Departures are very punctual, though routes often take longer than expected. Stop by the Tourist Office downtown (underneath the Gold Museum in the Plaza—ask anyone and they'll be able to help you out). The bus system is a safe and even fun way to see a lot of the country cheaply and not have to worry about car rentals. Getting around without Spanish is no problem.\n\nSan José has a remarkably large number of bus stations for a town of that size; bus departure points occasionally change. Make sure to double check the location of the terminal for the bus you want to take.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\n\nThere is twice daily boat service from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Los Chiles"]]}," (in NE Costa Rica), former home of the Contras, to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Carlos (Nicaragua)"],["San Carlos"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nicaragua"]]},". The cost is about $5, plus a $1 fee. The boats usually leave  ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Carlos (Nicaragua)"],["San Carlos"]]}," at 10:30AM and 4PM.\n\nSmall ship cruises carrying less than 100 passengers begin in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Panama"]]}," and end in Costa Rica or reverse.  These cruises visit popular National Parks such as Manuel Antonio but also visit remote beaches and coastline not accessible by road.  Prices range from $2000–$6000 per person for 7-10 day tours.\n\nLarger cruise ships occasionally dock or anchor at Puerto Caldera and Puntarenas for a day or so, usually to begin, end or continue cruises with itineraries through the Panama Canal to or from Caribbean or U.S. ports.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:CocosIslandCostaRica.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Cocos Island coastline"]]},"\n\nKeep in mind that Costa Rica, although it has established official street names in most cities for governmental purposes, most of the population is unaware of these names and if they are known, most streets will lack proper signs stating said names. Asking for directions from a local could result in a tedious and difficult conversation as said directions are given out based on a common or well known building, store, office or other landmark in order to find what you are looking for. As such, you would need to know important landmarks and their locations well enough to be able to get around more easily.\n\nKeep in mind that \"100 metros,\" or 100 meters are commonly used to refer to a city \"block,\" which are usually 100 meters, but in some cases could be more or less. However, despite what the exact distance is, many locals tend to use 100 meters or a city block when giving out directions.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" GPS Maps "]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" In addition to paper maps, you can also use the free GPS maps from the Cenrut project.

Also, there are many narrow bridges scattered around the country. Exercise caution when traveling during the rainy season as some roads can be washed out\/flooded in low lying areas. If you plan on traveling into the mountainous regions like Monteverde, 4WD or AWD vehicles are strongly recommended. These roads are NOT paved and can be slick due to the consistent rainfall. Rockfalls\/landslides are common and guardrails are sparse. Also, visibility can be low around the cloud forest areas so use caution.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Public bus"]},"\nMost major tourist destinations in Costa Rica are serviced by at least two daily buses from and to San José. The advantages of public transportation in Costa Rica are that tickets are cheap (rarely more than $7 US per person) and they cover most towns around the country. However, nearly the entire bus system is based on routes in and out of San José and this can add significant travel time. The buses are also not booked with a reservation system so it is possible to not have a seat on popular routes. However, many do have assigned seats once you buy a ticket at the station and so get there early to be sure you get your bus.\n\nIn San José there is not one central bus station, but rather several different ones, with each station roughly serving a different area of the country, with some exceptions. For example, most of the service to the Caribbean side of the country leaves from the Terminal Gran Caribe. However, in November 2012 the direct service to the far south Caribbean coast moved to the Puntarenas bus station, which mostly serves the west side of the country. Still, you can still get to the Caribe side by taking a bus (on the Autotransportes Caribeños‎ line) from the Terminal Gran Caribe to Limón, and then transferring there to another bus south (the Mepe line). In short, do some research beforehand so you don't get lost looking for your bus. Often you can just call or email your final destination (e.g. your hotel) and they will tell you what bus to take, where to catch it and how often it runs.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Rental car"]},"\nOne great advantage of renting a car is that you can visit many of the secluded beaches and mountain areas. And with the power of the Internet, you can now rent just about any vehicle online and have it waiting for you when you arrive.\n\nFor 350-700 USD a week you can rent an econocar\/mid size 4WD.  Insurance is the majority of this cost and it is not optional.  Four-wheel-drive is good for extensive traveling outside the Central Valley, especially in the wet season.  In the dry season going from La Fortuna to Monteverde via a direct route was over a boulder strewn 15-30 MPH road.  Four-wheel-drive was also useful on the Nicoya coast.(above based on 2001 roads). It's often possible to rent a car with a local driver from the various tour companies, if driving yourself seems a bit daunting.\n\nDue to the condition of most roads outside San Jose, car insurance, even with a zero-deductible option, generally does not cover tires and rims. Car rental companies require a guaranty deposit from 750 USD during the rental period and a credit card is ",{"type":"'''''","value":["necessary"]}," for this process. Using an insurance program provided by some types of gold or platinum credit cards is a good advantage, since these credit cards would cover small scratches, small dents as well as the entire rented vehicle in case of collision or theft.\n\nYou have to ",{"type":"'''''","value":["exercise caution"]}," when renting a car in Costa Rica; where it is not uncommon for rental companies to claim \"damage\" they insist ",{"type":"''","value":["you"]}," inflicted on the vehicle.

Otherwise, go into ",{"type":"'''","value":["an ICT-accredited travel agent"]}," in San Jose and ask them to arrange rental for you.

At most of the hotels, the receptionist is able to assist travelers who want to travel across the country by arranging for the services of a driver. Rates are reasonable (US$29 per person, for example, to get from San Jose to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tamarindo"]]}," in April 2007) The drivers know the roads well; the vans are clean and comfortable; and they take you from door to door.\n\nTaxis are available in most large cities.

This can keep you from paying too much because the driver will not make unnecessary detours. Official taxis are red with a yellow triangle on the side. They also have yellow triangles on the side of the car which will have a number in it.  If the number matches the number listed on the license plate, it is an official taxi. Do not get in if the numbers do not match''.  \"Pirate Taxis\", though sometimes cheaper, are NOT SAFE.  Do not risk it.  If you are alone, especially.

Nearly anywhere you go you will find some kind of river trip to enjoy nature from a very unique point of view.\n\nThere is a wide variety of exciting rafting trips offered in Costa Rica. For many years, the rafting Mecca of Costa Rica was ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Turrialba"]]},", a large town embedded in the mountains near the Reventazon and Pacuare Rivers, on the Caribbean slope of Costa Rica.\n\nHowever, the Arenal Volcano area is now an increasingly-popular whitewater rafting destination with close access to the Sarapiqui and Toro Rivers, as well as the Class II-III Río Balsa which delight rafting enthusiasts in the Northern slopes of the country.\n\nOn the Pacific slope, the river with the largest volume, El General, is famous for multi-day adventures and for being an incredible playground for kayakers. The Coto Brus River is also part of this watershed. Further north, on the central Pacific coast, are the Savegre and Naranjo Rivers. In this area you have the opportunity to enjoy both half-day trips on the Naranjo River and 1-to-2-day trips on the Savegre River.\n\nThe Class III-IV Tenorio River near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Canas"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guanacaste"]]}," is a favorite among day-trippers from the beaches of Guanacaste, as well as part of shuttle-tour-shuttle services from the Arenal Volcano and Monteverde to the Guanacaste area. The lower section of the Tenorio River is widely-known for being an excellent nature float trip.\n\nThe Pacuare River (Class III-IV) is at the top of the list for 2- or 3-day adventures. If you are interested in similar trips, the Savegre River (Class III-IV) is an excellent alternative for an overnight rafting excursions.\n\nIf you want more adrenaline, the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Chorro Section"]}," (Class IV+) of the Naranjo River, near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Manuel Antonio"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Quepos"]]}," is one of the most exhilarating rafting trip of the country. This section is run from December to May.\n\nAs for nature-oriented trips, the Peñas Blancas River near the Arenal Volcano provides a great look at the tremendous biodiversity of the country.\n\nMost likely, any of these rafting trips will be the highlight of your active vacations, so don’t miss your chance to paddle one.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Fishing"]},"\n\nCosta Rica has some of the best Sport Fishing in the world and is the first country to practice catch and release fishing. The Pacific side has incredible fishing for Sailfish, Marlin, Dorado, Tuna, Wahoo, Roosterfish, Snapper, and more. The Caribbean side and Northern regions of Costa Rica are famous for big Tarpon and big Snook. Over sixty-four world records have been caught in Costa Rica. Half day, Full day and Multi-Day Trips are available. They love to eat turtles.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Surf"]},"\n\nCosta Rica has many surfing hotspots.  The best time of year to surf is from November - August.\n\nThe Pacific coast, particularly in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Central Pacific"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guanacaste"]]},", has some of the best surfing in Central America.\n\nIn the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guanacaste"]]}," region, there are several beaches to choose from if you intend to go surfing.  Among them, Playa Negra and Playa Grande are two stand out breaks.  Playa Negra breaks over a shallow lava reef producing fast hollow waves for advanced surfers only.  Playa Grande is the most consistent break in the area with surfable conditions most days of the year.  It breaks over a sandy bottom and is good for beginner and experienced surfers. Playa Nosara is another option for beginning to intermediate surfers. It's waves could be a little overwhelming for a complete novice, but for someone who has a beginning grasp on the technique, it is a nice place with a good local scene.\n\nTamarindo is a good beach to learn how to surf, whilst Playa del Coco offers advanced surfers the chance to surf at Witches Rock and Ollie´s Point. On the Caribbean side there are beautiful beaches, but limited surfing prospects.\n\nThe southern Costa Rica area has two very good spots for surf: ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dominical"]]}," and Pavones Beach. Pavones Beach has thick, heavy waves which consistently barrel and can get really big. It's little known, but picturesque and untamed; Definitely not for the light hearted.\n\nIn the southern tip of the Nicoya Peninsula, Montezuma has one of the most beautiful beach breaks in the area, called Playa Grande. It's a short eastward walk from Montezuma village. The break is great for all surfers.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Biking"]},"\n\nCosta Rica has great mountain biking routes, particularly near Irazu, Turrialba and Arenal Volcanoes. There is popular dirt road that connects Irazu Volcano and the foothills of Turrialba Volcano that is perfect for mountain biking, as it traverses the mountain and presents great views of the Cartago Valley (weather permitting, of course).\n\nThe area around ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lake Arenal"]]}," is also a great spot to bike. You can circle the lake in one long day, or break up the ride in two sleeping in Tilarán or Nuevo Arenal. The use of mountain bikes is a must, since the southern shore of the lake is unpaved.\n\nThe Nicoya Peninsula also has great riding, particularly the stretch between Sámara, Puerto Coyote and Malpais. There is a coastal road that connects these three beachtowns.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Golf"]},"\n\nCosta Rica is also known as a haven for some of the most lush, tropical golfing environments in the world.  At any course, you can expect to an ensemble of exotic, indigenous animals; jungle; mountainous terrain; and a surreal, blue ocean painting a brilliant, seclusive experience.\n\nCourses are located in 3 major areas of Costa Rica: ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guanacaste"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Jose (Costa Rica)"],["San Jose"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Central Pacific"],["Mid Pacific"]]},". Due to road conditions, you should check the driving times between courses.\n\nThere are many tournaments during the year that any traveler can participate in. Most courses offer shoe and club rentals.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Other Active\/Extreme Sports"]},"\n\nWind surfing in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tilarán"]]}," area is some of the best in the world.\n\n\"Canopy tours\" or ziplines are very popular tourist activities and are found all over Costa Rica. These typically cost between $30–$50 depending on the company and use a series of zip-lines to travel between platforms attached to the trees, through and over the forest canopy and over rivers. The person is secured with harnesses to the metal cords, as some go very high off the ground. Be sure to ask about the zipline certification before booking and be sure to take part in the safety briefing before participating.\n\nAnother form of canopy tour is via an aerial tram which are ski lifts modified for the rainforest. These trams are slower allowing the visitor to view wildlife in the canopy. Each tram has a guide who will explain the flora and fauna. The trams exist at adventure parks near Jaco Beach and just outside Braulio Carrillo National Park and are appropriate for all ages. The trams may be combined with ziplining and often have other attractions such as medicine gardens or serpentaria so guests may learn more about Costa Rica.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nThe local currency is the ",{"type":"''","value":["Costa Rican colón"]}," (plural, ",{"type":"''","value":["colones"]},") ",{"type":"'''","value":["CRC"]}," named after Christopher Columbus (whose name was Cristobal Colón in Spanish) sometimes shown locally as ₡ and sometimes shown using the more commonly available US cent symbol '¢' or ₵. \n\nIn March 2014, USD1 = CRC548 or €1 = CRC762. Money exchange is provided at most banks, however it is recommended to do so at the state banks, especially the Banco Nacional, since they have lower rates.  There is also a money exchange service at the airport, but it is outrageously expensive. But note that the use of US dollars is quite common; in the tourist setting, almost everything is priced in US dollars (but sometimes prices are cheaper in colones). When a price is quoted in \"dollars\", the speaker may be thinking of a dollar as 500 colones;  so it is always worth checking whether this is what is meant. When paying with US dollars, you may receive change in local currency; thus, if you are about to leave the country and don't need colones any more, make sure to have small-denomination US dollar bills.\n\nYou can find ATMs in most places. They normally dispense US dollars and colones. With Visa you get money at almost all ATMs. If you've got a MasterCard try the ATMs in the AM\/PM supermarkets, they give you up to CRC250,000 (c. USD500). Another option are the ATH-ATM's but they just give you up to CRC100,000  (c. USD200) each transaction.\nEC-Cards (European) are accepted at all ATMs. The limit is usually only set by the Card. In addition, drawing money with your EC-Card will almost always give you a better exchange rate than changing cash in a bank.\n\nIt is also very common to pay even small amounts by Visa or MasterCard with Amex much less common.\n\nYou might get a discount (such as between 5% and 10%) when paying in cash, but it is not common enough to be expected. Also, it is not really necessary to get colones at the airport because you can pay everywhere in US dollars and receive colones as change. Most places except the smallest restaurants take credit cards and many places including the gas stations take American Express.\n\nTraveler's checks are rarely used. When paying with traveler's checks, unless for hotel nights, change them first at a bank. Expect long delays with traveler's checks at the bank, lots of stamping, the higher up the official at the bank the more stamps they have. Dollars are easier.\n\nThe most common souvenirs are made from wood.  Unless it's marked as responsible (plantation grown wood), it is most likely not and may be contributing to the deforestation of Costa Rica — or even Nicaragua or Panama!\n\nMost visitors returning home are not allowed to bring back any raw foods or plants.  Accordingly, the single most desirable commodity for visitors to take home may be ",{"type":"''","value":["roasted"]}," (not green) coffee, considered by many as some of the world's best.  Numerous web sites explain the fine qualities of various growing regions, types of beans, types of roasting and sources for purchase.  Best prices come by purchasing several (sealed) bags of 12 ounces or so.  Experts recommend buying whole beans (entero) in any kind of storage; whole beans last longer, and Costa Rican ground coffee often contains sugar, as it is preferred by locals.  The stores in San Jose airport will sell you excellent coffee, but other good quality blends can be found in local supermarkets and direct from the roasters.  It can be an expensive but delicious habit.  If you're serious about your coffee, bring at least a partially-empty suitcase and fill it with perhaps a year's supply (web sites explain how to store it that long).  Take care with tourist outlets where small quantities may cost as much as ordering on the Internet.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nCosta Rican cuisine can be described as simple but wholesome.  The spiciness often associated with Latin America has typically originated in Mexico, most Costa Rican foods are not spicy, but, as they simmer in a large pot, the flavors are blended.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Gallo pinto"]}," is a mixture of rice and beans with a little cilantro or onion thrown in. While more common at breakfast, it can also be served at lunch or dinner.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Casado"]},", which means married, is the typical lunch in Costa Rica, containing rice and beans with meat, chicken or fish, always served with salad and fried plantain.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Plato del dia"]},", is the 'Plate of the Day' and is often a ",{"type":"'''","value":["Casado"]},", but has the meat or fish selection of the day.  Usually around 5.00 USD and includes a natural juice.\n\nGood, fresh ",{"type":"'''","value":["fruit"]}," is abundant in variety and low in cost.  Mercados provide an excellent place to sample fruit and other Costa Rican fare, with many including sit-down snack bars. You are encouraged to experiment because some of the local fruits do not \"travel well\" as they are bruised easily and or have a short shelf life.  The mango found in store in North America are much more fibrous and less sweet than the mangos found in Costa Rica.  The fingerling bananas are much more creamy and less tart than the ones found in North America.\n\nBe sure to stop off at a rest stop along any of the roads: a casado and beer will cost ~$3.\n\nDon't forget to try the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Salsa Lizano"]}," that you will surely find at any restaurant. It is a mild vegetable sauce that has a hint of curry and is slightly sweet. It's often referred to as Costa Rican ketchup.  It tastes good on just about anything!  Bring some home with you!  You can find smaller sized bottles at any market.\n\nAlso as per usual in Central America standard breakfast fare is a ham sandwich, so people averse to eating pork might be advised to check out a grocery market for something else.  Many Ticos will go to a local bakery and buy a loaf of white bread.\n\nVegetarians will find it surprisingly easy to eat well in Costa Rica.\n\nDon't forget to tip tour guides, drivers, bellboys and maids. Restaurant bills include a 10% gratuity but leave an extra tip for good service. North Americans often get better service because they are used to tipping separately, but it's not necessary.\n\nThe beef cattle are raised on grass; the meat will taste differently from corn fed cattle. The cuts of meat at the local restaurants are also different. The taste of chicken is not discernibly distinct.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nMost places have potable water, so don't worry about drinking tap water. Bottled water is also available at low prices.\n\nRefrescos are beverages made from fresh fruit (cas, guanabana, sandia\/watermelon, mora\/blackberry, fresa\/strawberry, granadilla\/passion fruit), sugar and either water or milk. All sodas (mom and pop diners) serve these.  You can also easily buy the standard international soda pops. 'Fresca', 'Canada Dry' and the local 'Fanta Kolita' (fruit punch) are recommended.\n\nThe national drink is called ",{"type":"''","value":["guaro"]},", which is made from fermented sugar cane.  It is similar to vodka, and is usually drunk with water and lemon. Note that it's not a very \"clean\" liquor, so exercise caution.\n\nThere are approximately 8 different national beers available (and most international), which are sold in cans, bottles and even kegs. The most common beers in the country are Pilsen and Imperial: all bars and restaurants serve both. Bavaria, \"Bavaria Negra\" (dark) and Bavaria Light are considered higher quality but more expensive, Rock Ice and Rock Ice Limón (lemon flavor) has a higher alcohol percentage and is less common in rural areas. Heineken is locally made under license and is more expensive as well.\n\nReady-to-drink coffee is excellent and considered (again) to be among the best in the world.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n\n\nYou can find many places to stay all over Costa Rica, including hotels, aparthotels, condos, vacation rentals, and cabinas. Vacation Homes, Cabinas, and Condos can be less expensive than hotels and provide more flexibility in your adventure to Costa Rica. Costa Rica is known as a world leader for eco and sustainable travel and accommodations are often listed as 'eco-lodges'. They do tend to be more expensive though the government does have a well functioning certification program.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Learn"]},"\n\nYou can learn Spanish in Costa Rica.  Reflecting the higher living standard, it's a little more expensive than other countries such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guatemala"]]},", but then again, the education level of your teachers will be much higher.\n\nCosta Rica is a great place to learn Spanish as the \"ticos\" have a dialect that is easy to understand and digest for someone just starting to learn the language. There are many language schools that provide intensive instruction with group classes lasting 4 hours per day, Monday to Friday. Almost all Spanish schools will also offer host family accommodations and possibly some alternative such as a student residence or discounted hotel rates.\n\nThe key factor when going to study Spanish in Costa Rica is to decide what is the right location for you. The beach locations tend to be on the touristy side so they do not necessarily give the greatest immersion experience, however there are many Spanish schools near the beach as students like to split their time between studying Spanish in the classroom combined with activities on the beach or just relaxing on their time away from work. There is a growing trend of these Spanish schools at the beach also offering Surfing or Photography classes due to the environment around the school and the proximity to good surf.\n\nStudying in the San Jose area has many benefits. There is the luxury aspect of city life since it tends to be much more modern than the rustic beach locations. Host families and Spanish schools tend to have nicer facilities. The school Babylon Idiomas ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.babylon-idiomas.com\/en\/learn-spanish-costa-rica.htm"]}," offers good courses and personal service and is located not only in San José but also in three other places in Costa Rica. \nSan Jose also has fewer tourists so it is great from an immersion point of view as you can practice your Spanish in a setting where people are not automatically switching to English to accommodate your native language. It is much better that you struggle with your Spanish and force your brain to think in a different language so your communication becomes much smoother.\n\nThere are also a number of language schools that can be found throughout the Central Valley, particularly in Heredia and its surrounding cantons. These language schools typically offer only Spanish to foreign students from the United States and Europe but some, including the Instituto Norte Americano in Heredia, offer Spanish to foreign students, and English and Mandarin to local ones. Many of these language schools are also instrumental in helping the surrounding community, either through monetary donations or educational opportunities that otherwise may not have existed for the local Costa Rican population. Schools such as IAC (Instituto de Apredizaje de Costa Rica) in Manuel Antonio, La Escuela Armonia in Guanacaste, as well as the Instituto Norte Americano in Heredia have frequently acted as educational hubs for their surrounding communities, giving free English classes to teachers of nearby schools and helping to raise money for worthy causes.\n\nSome hostels offer packages that include Spanish lessons and daily home-stays with the locals (in addition to your room and board).\n\nCosta Rica is also a good place to become proficient in ocean sports like surfing and scuba diving. There are numerous surf shops, that provide surfing lessons and surf camps throughout the coastal areas.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Work"]},"\nThe local newspaper, La Nación, has an extensive jobs listing every Sunday and Monday. You must be a resident or be sponsored by a company to work legally in Costa Rica.  ESL teachers can find work in Costa Rica with Bachelor`s Degree and a TESOL certification. ESL teachers can expect to earn CRC226,700-566,750 (monthly) and will usually teach 8–15 hours in a week. Contracts will usually not include accommodations (the employer may help), airfare, and health-care.\n\nCosta Rica is an open business country and investors are always welcome, so if you or your company is interested in founding a new or buying a business in Costa Rica, it is best to contact a Costa Rican lawyer about your interest in investing.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Volunteering"]},"\nThere are several opportunities to engage in volunteer work in Costa Rica.

Its doctors are known worldwide as some of the best. Many people from U.S, Canada and Europe go there to be treated, not only because the quality of the service but for the cost. First class Hospitals can be found in the capital.  There is a public\/private hospital system.  There is excellent care in each.  The public system has much longer waits, while the private system has shorter waits.  If you are unfortunate enough to have a very sick child requiring hospitalization, the child will be transferred to the only children's hospital in CR, located in the capital.  This children's hospital is public.\n\nThere have been outbreaks of dengue fever in some areas of the country and an outbreak of malaria was reported in November 2006 from the province of Limon but just a few cases.  Protection against mosquito bites is very important, wearing lightweight long pants, long sleeved shirts and using insect repellents with high concentrations of DEET is recommended by the CDC.  If you are going to be in very rural areas known to be malaria-infested areas, you might want to consider an anti-malarial med.  However, most travelers to Costa Rica do just fine with updated childhood immunizations and taking preventative measures against mosquito bites (rather than take anti-malarial medication).\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Tap water"]}," in urban areas of the country is almost always safe to drink.

Costa Rica has some of the best beaches in the world. Atlantic coast is just five hours away from the Pacific one and both offer different views and landscapes. There are no signs indicating an unsafe beach due to riptides, so take precautions and listen to the locals on where it is safe to swim. The public beaches do not have life guards.  A traveler should learn how to swim out of a rip tide and not swim alone.  There are some active volcanoes in Costa Rica and they ",{"type":"''","value":["are"]}," dangerous, so follow the warning signs posted. The slopes of the Arenal volcano invite visitors to climb closer to the summit, but there have been fatalities in the past with unseen gas chambers. Also be wary of the climate of Costa Rica.

Some locals throw chicken meat and watch them eat.

There is a thriving gay scene in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Jose (Costa Rica)"],["San Jose"]]}," with many gay and lesbian options for night-life (La Avispa, Club Oh!, Bochinche among others). The Manuel Antonio, Jacó, and Quepos area is also a favorite spot with several gay hotels and bars.\n\nThere are a good number of Gay\/lesbian or Gay-Friendly accommodations in Costa Rica. Accommodations seem to be of the higher quality offering a variety of services and of course, discretion. Many hotels, travel agencies, and resorts are run by gays and\/or are gay-friendly.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Medical Tourism "]},"\nAccording to the Costa Rica Tourism Board, about 200 medical procedures are performed every month at the nation's hospitals for medical tourists.  Among the procedures done are cosmetic surgery, knee and hip replacement, cataract removal and other eye treatments, weight loss surgery and dental care.   Health care in Costa Rica is attractive for international patients because of the low prices, high care standards, and access to tourist attractions.  For example, a hip replacement costs around US$12,000 and a tummy tuck costs around US$4,400.\n\nThe main medical tourism centers are CIMA Hospital, Hospital Clinica Biblica and Hospital Hotel La Catolica. In turn, these hospitals use medical tourism facilitators who can arrange every aspect of your trip from beginning to end.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\nThe international calling code\/country code for Costa Rica is 506.",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\nA postage stamp to Europe is 125 Colones (around 21 US cents).\n\nThe primary means of outside contact are through email and public pay telephones.\n\nInternet cafes are fairly easy to find in tourist areas, with prices all over the place. Some of these offer long distance calls over the internet.\n\nPublic phones are accessed with calling cards (tarjetas telefonicas) which can be purchased at most shops, even in outlying areas.\n\nThere are four different types of pay-phones:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Coin phones.

They also allow you to send SMS messages and emails as well."]},"\nBoth types of calling cards are typically available in pharmacies and other locations where you see the sticker on the door.\n\nDomestic calls are quite cheap and the price is the same wherever you call. Calls to cellular phones are charged significantly more though.\n\nInternational calls are fairly expensive. The cheapest way to make them is over the internet using a service such as Skype at an Internet café. But making short calls using the domestic calling cards (you can make international calls using these but the denominations of the calling cards are quite small so your call will be short!) or the international calling cards available within Costa Rica (all from the government phone monopoly ICE) is the next best deal. Certainly better than credit card calls or using a US calling card generally.\n\nCell service in Costa Rica is provided using GSM technology at 1800 MHz and 3G data operating at 850 MHz.  Note that the GSM phone systems in the United States and Canada use different frequencies and that travelers from there will need a \"world\" handset, such as a tri-band or quad-band phone, if you want to use your existing cell phone.  Most of the country has very good GSM coverage (including most of the capital).   Roaming is possible with a GSM handset (i.e. using your regular cell number that you use in your home country) but can be extremely expensive.\n\nIf you want to use a local Costa Rica number, you can rent cell phone service, and of course anyone can buy a cell phone.  You used to have to be a documented resident of the Costa Rica to own your own cell phone number, and even then you only got one if there are numbers available.  You still have to be a resident if you want monthly billed service to an address (such as in the U.S.).  But since the passage of the CAFTA treaty in 2009, the government cell phone monopoly has been broken and service is now provided by many operators, including Grupo ICE ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.grupoice.com"]}," under the Kölbi brand, TuYo Movil (reselling the ICE service), Movistar and Claro (the latter two also providing service throughout Latin America).  Currently coverage on Kölbi is best because the network is the oldest and most built out (e.g. there is no Movistar service in Monteverde).  If you have an unlocked cell phone (either one from home or bought in Costa Rica—all cell phones sold in Costa Rica must be unlocked), prepaid (",{"type":"''","value":["prepago"]},") SIM cards can provide a local number and service can be purchased throughout the country by anyone with a passport from any country, or a ",{"type":"''","value":["cedula"]}," (Costa Rican ID card).  At the baggage claim at the San José airport is a Kölbi kiosk, and you will also see signs Kölbi, Movistar, Claro, and others throughout the country where service is for sale.  Rates are set by the government and you can get a SIM for as little as ¢2500 (about $5) and 3G (or sometimes just EDGE) data service is also available by the day, week, or month for ¢300 or less a day.  To add value you buy a ",{"type":"''","value":["recarga"]}," (recharge card), scratch off the card to get a PIN, and text the PIN from your phone to a special number.  To keep the card active, it must be recharged at least once in a 120 day period.  If it is not charged within a 120 days, you have a 30 day grace period before your SIM chip is deactivated and you lose your phone number.  Also keep in mind that you may have trouble getting your SIM activated on Sunday, because like many things in Costa Rica, the SIM activation system may be shut down that day.  Also not all shops sell SIMs—many just sell the recharge cards.  Get your SIM at the airport if you can.\n\nMost tourist areas (hotels, coffee shops, bars, restaurants) have Wi-fi access for free.  Just ask someone for the password.  You can bring your smart phone loaded with skype or google phone and make calls to your home country. It is an easy way to stay connected with email and social media.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Costa Rica"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Costa Rica"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Central America\/Costa Rica\/"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["9.9333"],["-84.0833"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Central America"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecountry"]]}]
