After the flooding of the Cottbus-Nord surface mine, the city will lie on the shore of the one of the largest lakes in the district.

Its proximity to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Berlin"]]}," allows a lot of people to commute between the two cities.  Today, it is most associated with coal mining, Communist-era prefabricated buildings, and the nearby Spreewald forest, but the city has much more to offer visitors than drab East German nostalgia.\n\nThe city's history is inexorably linked to its expansion during the industrial revolution. Today, it offers a beautiful and well-preserved medieval core and its surrounding 19th century districts that arose during the city's textile boom. There are many parks in and around the old city center which give the city a \"green\" reputation.  The Soviet-era suburbs do not currently have much to interest tourists, but significant efforts to refurbish these districts and make them more attractive are being undertaken.\n\nHistorically, Cottbus is renowned for three specialties: Cloth, Grain and beer, and \"baumkuche\" (lit. tree-cakes), a traditional circular layer cake that resembles tree rings.\n\nStarting in around 1860, the arrival of the industrial revolution granted Cottbus huge economic benefits. The first clothmaking factory and the first military barracks were founded here during that time. Then, in 1865, the railroad connecting Berlin to Görlitz was built through Cottbus, which resulted in an industrial and economic boom. Other railway companies eventually connected their lines through the city as well, ultimately  interconnecting the city with the nearby clothing mill towns of Guben and Forst, as well as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wroclaw"]]},".\n\nDr. Carl-Thiem, the father of trauma surgery in Germany, founded a private clinic in the city in 1885, where it still resides. In 1886, the first telephone system was installed, and  after a merger of the three largest German carpet manufacturers, a public textile college was also founded.\n\nOn November 1, 2008, the city's unique Art Nouveau theater celebrated the 100th anniversary of its opening, which was commemorated by a special ceremony featuring the local citizens, which was attended by the State President of Brandenburg.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["mapframe"],["51.76274"],["14.337845"],["zoom=12"],["height=350"],["width=400"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nDrewitz Airport lies a few miles north of the city, which is available for charter flights and civilian aviation uses, but offers no regular commercial service.\n\nThe nearest airport with international service is Dresden, 100 km southwest.
