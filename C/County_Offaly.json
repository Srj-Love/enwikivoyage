Wheelchair access and disabled parking are available at the sculpture park.Sculpture in the Parklands was founded by sculptor Kevin O'Dwyer in partnership with Bord na Mona, Lough Boora Parklands Group, Offaly County Council and the Arts Council in the development of this unique sculpture park.\n\nIn the wetlands and wildlife wilderness of Lough Boora, inspired by the rich natural and industrial legacy of the boglands, the artists have created a series of large-scale sculptures that are now part of the Parklands permanent collection. Sculpture in the Parklands began as an international sculpture symposium in 2002 when seven Irish and international artist created works of art over a three week residency. The success of the symposium led to the formation of Sculpture in the Parklands and eight site-specific sculptures created during the symposium form the nucleus of the project. Currently there are 20 site specific sculptures in the parklands.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Rock of Cashel"]}," in Tipperary, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Newgrange"]]}," in Meath and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Lough Owel"]}," in Westmeath are all about an hours drive out of the county.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["East Coast and Midlands"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:County Offaly"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["53.25"],["-7.5"]]}]
