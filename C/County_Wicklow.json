The mountains dominate the North and centre of the county, while along the coast is relatively flat. South Wicklow gives way to rolling hills where there is a lot more farmland.\n\nMuch of the mountainous area is covered with a layer of peat and this in turn has heather and conifer evergreen forests growing on it, with gorse in the drier areas.

A visitor may notice the wide variety of accents on display in Wicklow. People from the hills tend to sound different from those on the coast. Residents of Bray & Greystones have distinctively Dublin-tinged accents. Likewise, the voices of southern and western 'Wicklowites' carry the influence of neighbouring counties. One part of the unique Wicklow 'dialect' you may hear in Wicklow town, Arklow town or inland, is the use of the word 'quern' to replace 'very'. As in 'I'm quern tired'.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nThe Wicklow mountains, being mountains, are not particularly well-served by public transport, which is surprising given their proximity to the capital and their popularity among visitors. Therefore the car is often the most convenient way of travelling around the county. Those travelling from Dublin to the east of the county should take the N11 in the Direction of Wexford. Meanwhile those travelling to the west of the county should take the N81.\n\nWicklow roads can vary greatly from modern motorways to rough mountain roads & petrol filling stations can, at times, be hard to find.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\n\nWicklow doesn't have a public airport, but due to its' proximity to the capital it can be easily reached from Dublin Airport, the largest airport in the country - see the 'Get in' section of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dublin"]]}," article for additional information on flying to Dublin airport.\n\nThe most straightforward way to get to your destination in County Wicklow from Dublin Airport is to travel by the dark green 'Dublin Bus' airport shuttle service to Busarás (Dublin city's central bus station near Custom House Quay) & to take a connecting bus or train from there.\n\nSimilarly for passengers to either ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bray"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Greystones"]]}," a direct 'Aircoach' bus line exists. Further information on the Aircoach service can be found by following this link: ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.aircoach.ie\/"]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\n\nIf you are travelling by car and you arrive at the sea port of Rosslare, Wicklow town is about a 1½ hour drive away. For ferry travellers who leave the car behind you can take public buses to Wicklow. Buses run on the Rosslare to Dublin route and serve Arklow, Wicklow & Bray. More information is available on the Bus Éireann website.\n\nThose arriving at Dublin Port or Dún Laoghaire harbour from the UK should take the N11 road to reach the East of County Wicklow or the N81 to reach the West of the county. Likewise those travelling without a car can either get the train directly from Dublin(Connolly Station) or Dún Laoghaire station to reach Wicklow, Rathdrum, Bray or Arklow. Otherwise these towns & other destinations not served by trains can be reached by Bus Éireann coaches. Travellers are recommended to check the Irish Rain & Bus Éireann websites in advance to plan their route..\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By rail"]},"\n\nA coastal rail line serves Bray, Greystones, Kilcoole, Wicklow, Rathdrum and Arklow. However, services to anywhere but the first two are infrequent and overpriced. Visitors from elsewhere in the EU may be disappointed at the lack of connecting public transport services to anywhere within the mountains. A return ticket from Dublin’s Connolly station to Greystones town costs €8.90 and takes around 50 minutes. Timetables are available from the website of Irish Rail.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nTravellers to County Wicklow will find the public bus service to be of much more use than the coastal train service, which avoids much of the mountainous areas which Wicklow is best known for.\n\nBuses serve all major towns & many villages along the route. Kilmacanogue, Newtown Mount-Kennedy, Ashford, Wicklow and Arklow are served by the Bus Éireann commuter network, with hourly services north to Dublin and Bray, and south to Wexford, Waterford and Rosslare Harbour. This route is numbered #133. Alternatively less frequent buses serve Rathdrum & Avoca.It is not entirely uncommon for buses to arrive at a stop later than scheduled. A one-way ticket to or from Dublin costs around €8 & the journey time is just over an hour.\n\nOn the western side of the mountains, Blessington is served by the Bus Eireann #180 bus service from Dublin to Athy. Likewise Blessington, and to a lesser scale Ballymore Eustace and Ballyknockan, are also served by the conventional 'Dublin Bus' (No. 65) service which operates fairly frequently throughout the day.
