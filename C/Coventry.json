It has a population of just over 300,000, making it the eleventh largest city in the country. Locally, the city is known as 'The Three Spired City', named for the church and cathedral spires that form the most striking aspect of the city's landscape. Coventry is perhaps best known for its association with the 11th century legend of Lady Godiva and for its two cathedrals, one of which is preserved as ruins after heavy bombing in the Second World War. Although an old city, visitors should not expect much in the way of medieval architecture or old-world charm. Extensive rebuilding of the city following the war in the 1940s and 1950s replaced much of the city's pre-war appeal with questionable concrete structures and a highly pedestrianised city centre.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nThe area that Coventry now occupies has been inhabited for over 1,000 years. The city's most notable claim to fame is its association with Lady Godiva, who rode naked through the city streets in order to gain a remission of the oppressive taxation imposed by her husband on his tenants. Lore has it that the term 'Peeping Tom' is derived from this tale, describing a man named Tom who did not cover his eyes as she rode through the streets. Coventry has been an economically important city in the past, being a hub for the cloth trade in the Middle Ages and for the burgeoning automotive industry in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The city's industrial prowess helped Britain's war efforts in the early 20th century; it also however made it an obvious target in the Second World War. A series of German bombing raids from 1940-42 (the Coventry Blitz) destroyed much of the city's infrastructure, although the single night of bombing in November 1940 dealt the largest damage, killing more than 500 people. \n\nIn the succeeding decades after the war, most of the old medieval dwellings were not rebuilt in lieu of more modern constructions, which at the time consisted of brutalist concrete structures. Coventry has undergone extensive remodelling in recent years, most notably within the city centre, making it more pedestrian-friendly. More recently, major regeneration projects such as the Stirling Prize shortlisted ",{"type":"''","value":["Phoenix Initiative"]}," have attempted to make the city a more attractive place. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh = 7"],["febhigh = 7"],["marhigh = 10"],["aprhigh = 12"],["mayhigh = 16"],["junhigh = 19"],["julhigh = 22"],["aughigh = 21"],["sephigh = 18"],["octhigh = 14"],["novhigh = 10"],["dechigh = 8"],["janlow = 1"],["feblow = 1"],["marlow = 3"],["aprlow = 4"],["maylow = 7"],["junlow = 10"],["jullow = 12"],["auglow = 12"],["seplow = 10"],["octlow = 7"],["novlow = 4"],["declow = 2"],["janprecip = 61"],["febprecip = 44"],["marprecip = 51"],["aprprecip = 49"],["mayprecip = 51"],["junprecip = 57"],["julprecip = 50"],["augprecip = 66"],["sepprecip = 59"],["octprecip = 59"],["novprecip = 58"],["decprecip = 62"],["description = See the 5 day forecast for Coventry from the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.metoffice.gov.uk\/public\/weather\/forecast\/coventry#?tab=fiveDay&fcTime=1377644400 Met Office"]}]]},"\nIn common with most of the UK, Coventry experiences cool winters and mild summers with moderate annual rainfall.
