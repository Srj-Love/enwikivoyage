It was founded in 1741 after the population of settlers was significant enough to separate from Warwick and form a new town. Much of Coventry is of historical note as home to many villages and homesteads from the 1700s, including those of Nathaniel Greene and Thomas Paine.  Some of the villages include Greene, Washington, Anthony, and Hopkins Hollow.  There are two main commercial areas in Coventry.  The first is Route 3, which is also known as Tiogue Avenue or Nooseneck Hill Road. Most of the stores and restaurants can be found on this main road.  The second large commercial area is called The Centre of New England, which has many stores, restaurants, and hotels.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]}," \nT.F.
