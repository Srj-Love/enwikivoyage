It has a population of around 12 000 people.\n\nDuring World War Two Cowra was the site of an internment camp for Japanese prisoners of war. On 5 August 1944 the POWs staged a mass breakout; nearly half were killed. After the war however, the Australian Returned Servicemen’s League assumed responsibility not only for the graves of the four Australians killed in the breakout, but for the Japanese section of the cemetery. In 1960 the Japanese government had their war dead from around Australia re-interned at Cowra. As a consequence, many Japanese people visit Cowra, in addition to local tourists.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Tourist Information "]},"\nCowra Visitor Information Centre\nPO Box 34\nCowra, NSW 2794\n\nLocated at Olympic Park, Mid-Western Highway, Cowra NSW 2794\n\nP. 61 2 6342 4333\nE. info@cowratourism.com.au\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cowratourism.com.au\/ Cowra Tourism"]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By car"]},"\nFrom ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sydney"]]},": \nTravel over the Blue Mountains via ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bathurst (New South Wales)"],["Bathurst"]]},".

From garage cellar doors to distinct historical buildings and vineyard art galleries. The original variety to be grown in Cowra in the 1970s was the Chardonnay grape. This classic and flavoursome Chardonnay established Cowra as a quality grape growing region. Soon after, Shiraz, Semillon and Cabernet Sauvignon varieties were planted. In recent years, the region’s enterprising vignerons have produced some excellent wines from different varieties such as Sangiovese, Mourvedre and Tempranillo.\n\nToday, there are over 40 vineyards dotted around the Cowra, Billimari and Canowindra area which make up the Cowra Wine Region. Many of them offer boutique cellar door tastings, the chance to chat to local vignerons, see winemakers at work and sample some of Australia’s most promising wines.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.winesofcowra.com\/pages\/Cellar-Doors.html Wines of Cowra"]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Country Comfort Cowra Countryman Motor Inn"],["url=http:\/\/www.countrycomforthotels.com\/countrycomfort\/hotels?cid=143&pid=2355"],["email=reservations.cowra@countrycomforthotels.com"],["address=164 Kendal St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+61 2 6342-3177"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Cowra Crest Motel"],["url=http:\/\/cowracrestmotel.com.au\/"],["email="],["address=133 Kendal St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+61 2 6342-2799"],["tollfree="],["fax=+61 2 6341-1653"],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=131 Kendal Street"],["url=http:\/\/www.accommodationcowra.com.au"],["email="],["address=131 Kendal St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +61 428 697884"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=$99-160"],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=A centrally located, renovated 1930′s Art Deco building containing 6 two bedroom apartments."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\nContinue along the mid-western highway to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Grenfell"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Central West (New South Wales)"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usablecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Cowra"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Oceania\/Australia\/New South Wales\/Localities\/C\/Cowra\/"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["-33.835"],["148.6925"]]}]
