Some roads in Cranbrook are in poor shape, especially side streets. Main arterial roads, however, have been given some much needed attention in the past couple of years and are generally in good condition.\n\nMost restaurants and hotels are located on Highway 3\/95, which is also known as Van Horne Street in the south end of the city and Cranbrook Street in the north end.  The whole Hwy 3\/95 going through Cranbrook is usually called \"The Strip\". Downtown is located along Baker Street.\n\nCranbrook is also served by a nascent transit system consisting of seven routes connecting residential areas of the city to the downtown area as well as shopping centres. The Cranbrook transit system is geared more towards residents and is not of much use to tourists.\n\nTaxi service is readily available as an alternative to car rental and public transit.\n\nMuch of Cranbrook is pretty flat so biking around town would also be a reasonable option.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sightseeing"]},"\nCranbrook has as its backdrop the Rocky Mountains. Any visitor equipped with a camera will find no shortage of locations to photograph nature. Elizabeth Lake, located at the south end of Cranbrook, is a wildlife sanctuary and home to many different birds and animals, ripe for the photographing. Cranbrook also dates back to the late 1800's and has lot's of history to check out around downtown.
