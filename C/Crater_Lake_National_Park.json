A series of destructive eruptions around 5000 BC caused the mountain's peak to collapse into its lava chamber, resulting in a caldera nearly six miles (9.7 km) wide.  Over time, snowmelt and rain collected in the crater to form the lake, which at 1,949 feet (594 m) deep, is presently the deepest in the USA, 2nd in North America, and 9th in the world.  Based on a comparison of average depths, however, Crater Lake at 1148 feet (350 m), is the deepest in the Western Hemisphere and third deepest in the world.\n\nThe first known white man to reach the lake was prospector John Hillman, who found the lake in 1853.  Largely through the efforts of naturalist William Gladstone Steel, the United States declared Crater Lake a national park in 1902.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:CraterLakeVisitorCtr.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Crater Lake Visitor Center before the snow melt"]]},"\n\nCrater Lake's location high in the Cascade mountains (about 6,000 feet\/1,830 m above sea level) means that snow is often visible year-round.  The lake is often enveloped in heavy snow during the fall, winter, and spring, forcing the closure of roads and trails.  In fact, the lake averages 533 inches (1,353 cm) of snow a year.  Consequently, the best time to visit Crater Lake is in the summer months, when all facilities, roads, and trails are open.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nThe nearest major airport to Crater Lake National Park is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Rogue Valley International-Medford Airport"]},", located three miles (4.8 km) north of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Medford (Oregon)"],["Medford"]]}," and 80 miles (129 km) south of the park.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["From the north"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["From Eugene, Portland, and points north on I-5"]},": Follow Interstate 5 south to Roseburg, then take Oregon 138 east to the park's north entrance."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["From Bend and Central Oregon"]},": Follow U.S. 97 south to Oregon 138 west to the park's north entrance."]},{"type":"''","value":["The north entrance is typically closed for the winter season (mid-October to mid-June)."]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["From the south"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["From Medford and points south on I-5"]},": Follow Interstate 5 north to Medford, then take Oregon 62 north and east to the park's west entrance (open year round)."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["From Klamath Falls"]},": Follow U.S. 97 north to route 62 north and west to the park's south entrance (open year round)."]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By foot"]},"\nThe ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pacific Crest Trail"]]}," (PCT) is a well known trail that extends along the West coast of the United States, from Mexico to Canada.
