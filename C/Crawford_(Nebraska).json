The town was named after the late cavalry officer Lt. Emmet Crawford, who had been previously stationed at the Fort. In its early years, Crawford provided entertainment for the soldiers stationed at nearby Fort Robinson, giving the town a reputation for being wild and rowdy. It was an important point for commerce for many years, being located at the junction of two railroads. Crawford's economy also depended largely on Fort Robinson up through World War II, when the Fort contained a German POW camp and a training site for military dogs. Crawford has since transformed into a quiet rural town. The main local industries are agriculture and uranium mining.
