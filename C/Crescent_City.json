Its location is particularly vulnerable to such waves.  An extensive warning system has been installed to ensure the safety of residents and visitors alike and it works well.  When an offshore quake in 2005 triggered the tsunami alert system as a precaution, the city was evacuated in 20 minutes.  However, make sure to keep this concern in perspective; even in Crescent City, many more people die in auto accidents than by tsunamis.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=US_101.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["directionl1=N"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Coos Bay"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brookings-Harbor"]]}],["directionr1=S"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Eureka"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Trinidad (California)"],["Trinidad"]]}],["image2=US 199.svg"],["imagesize2=22"],["directionl2=N"],["majorl2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Grants Pass"]]}],["minorl2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cave Junction"]]}],["directionr2=S"],["majorr2=END"],["minorr2="]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["41.755833"],["-124.201667"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Del Norte County"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Crescent City, California"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North_America\/United_States\/California\/Localities\/C\/Crescent_City"]]}]
