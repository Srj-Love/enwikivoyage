[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Cripple Creek"]}," is a small town in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Colorado"]]},". It is a town steeped in gold mining history, still very much in evidence from the old mine ruins dotted about everywhere.  In fact, it promotes itself as \"the world's greatest gold camp\". In addition, the town is now a major casino destination, as 57% of the residents of Colorado voted to permit this town to have casinos (\"controlled gambling\") in order to breathe back life into it after it declined in tourism value from the 80's.  Today it is a bustling, lively and exciting town that begs exploration of its turn-of-the-20th-century buildings which have been immaculately maintained and makes for brilliant photo opportunities.  Watch out though - burros (wild donkeys) roam the streets at large, with the blessing of the townsfolk (except, of course, when the burros are munching up a local garden).\n\nA good time to visit is summer, as the weather is going to be lovely but also expect a high ratio of tourists.  The town, however, offers plenty to see and do at any time of year.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nThe best way to reach Cripple Creek is via your own car or motorcycle.
