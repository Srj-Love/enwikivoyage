The highest point is Dinara at 1,830 m.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nThe Croats settled in the region in the early 7th century and formed two principalities: Croatia and Pannonia. The establishment of the Trpimirović dynasty ca 850 brought strengthening to the Dalmatian Croat Duchy, which together with the Pannonian principality became a kingdom in 925 under King Tomislav. Independent Croatian kingdom lasted until 1102 when Croatia, after a series of dynastic struggles entered into a personal union with Hungary, with Hungarian king ruling over both countries. In 1526, after the Battle of Mohács, where Hungary suffered a catastrophic defeat against Ottoman Turks, Croatia severed it's relationship with Hungary and its parliament (Sabor) voted to form a new personal union with the Habsburg Monarchy. Croatia remained an autonomous kingdom within the Hapsburg state (and later Austria-Hungary) until the empire's dissolution following defeat in World War I.\n\nIn 1918, a short lived State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (carved out of south slavic parts of Austria-Hungary) joined Kingdom of Serbia to form the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, later renamed Yugoslavia in 1929. The new state was unitarist in character, erasing all historical borders within it's new territorial division, which resulted in a strong movement for more autonomy for Croatia. This was achieved in 1939, only days before the start of World War II, when Croatia was granted broad autonomy within Yugoslavia as Banovina of Croatia. When Germany and Italy attacked Yugoslavia in 1941, the state was dissolved, parts of it annexed to Germany and Italy, and puppet governments installed in Croatia and Serbia. Almost immediately, a strong resistance movement was formed, led by communist leader Josip Broz \"Tito\" (an ethnic Croat), which gained broad popular support. After the end of World War II, a new, communist Yugoslavia was formed with Tito becoming \"president for life\". Tito ruled with a strong hand, using political repression and secret police to quell any separatist sentiments, with the official motto of the new country being \"Brotherhood and Union\". Still, due to the fact that Yugoslavia didn't belong to the Warsaw Pact, having broken off political ties with USSR in 1948, it was by far the most open socialist country in Europe and its citizens enjoyed more civil liberties and a higher living standard compared to the rest of the Communist bloc.\nAfter Tito's death in 1980, the weakening of political repression led to a period of political instability. Faced with the rise of nationalist sentiment, a decade-long recession, and the weakening of communist grip on power on the eve of the fall of communism in Eastern Europe, first free elections were held in Yugoslavia in almost 45 years. In these elections, nationalist options won power in all Yugoslav republics, which led to rise in inter-ethnic tensions, culminating when Croatia and Slovenia declared their independence from Yugoslavia in 1991. This led to open war in newly independent Croatia and later in Bosnia and Herzegovina which declared its independence in 1992. The wars ended four years later, in 1995, with decisive Croatian victory in operation Storm, bringing peace to both countries. The anniversary of operation Storm is celebrated as Thanksgiving Day in Croatia every August 5th.\n\nAfter a period of accelerated economic growth in the late 90's and 2000's Croatia joined NATO in 2009 and the European Union in 2013. Croatia today is a functioning liberal democracy, with a free market system and a robust welfare state.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Regions"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Croatia Regions map.png"],["thumb"],["right"],["500px"],["Map of Croatia"]]},"\n\nThere are three distinct areas of Croatia: Lowland Croatia (cr: ",{"type":"''","value":["Nizinska Hrvatska"]},"), Littoral Croatia (",{"type":"''","value":["Primorska Hrvatska"]},") and Mountainous Croatia (",{"type":"''","value":["Gorska Hrvatska"]},") and these can be neatly split into five travel regions:\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Regionlist"],["region1name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Istria"]]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["Istra"]},")"],["region1color=#cba46b"],["region1items="],["region1description=A peninsula in the northwest, bordering ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Slovenia"]]}],["region2name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kvarner"]]}],["region2color=#83aec9"],["region2items="],["region2description=Seashore and highlands north of Dalmatia, includes subregions: Bay of Kvarner and Highlands (Lika and Gorski Kotar)"],["region3name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dalmatia"]]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["Dalmacija"]},")"],["region3color=#71b37b"],["region3items="],["region3description=A strip of mainland and islands between the Mediterranean and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bosnia and Herzegovina"]]}],["region4name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Slavonia"]]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["Slavonija"]},")"],["region4color=#aac496"],["region4items="],["region4description=Including subregions Slavonija and Baranja (north of river Drava) northeastern area of forests and fields, bordering ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hungary"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Serbia"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bosnia and Herzegovina"]]}],["region5name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Central Croatia"]]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["Središnja Hrvatska"]},")"],["region5color=#b5af99"],["region5items="],["region5description=North central highlands, location of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zagreb"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zagreb"]]}," - the capital and largest city"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dubrovnik"]]}," - historic coastal city and UNESCO World Heritage site"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Split"]]}," - ancient port city with Roman ruins"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pula"]]}," - biggest town in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Istria"]]}," with the Roman amphitheater (commonly called Arena)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Osijek"]]}," - capital of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Slavonia"]]}," and an important city"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sisak"]]}," - largest river port and most developed industrial city in Central Croatia, formerly ",{"type":"''","value":["Siscia"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Slavonski Brod"]]}," - a once important star-fort on the Ottoman defensive line"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rijeka"]]}," - Croatia's largest and main port"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Varaždin"]]}," - Croatia's former Baroque capital"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zadar"]]}," - biggest city of north-central Dalmatia with rich history"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Krka National Park"]]}," – river valley near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Šibenik"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" Island of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cres"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" Island of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hvar"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" Island of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brač"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" Island of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Krk"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" Island of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Solta"],["Šolta"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Makarska"]]}," on the Makarska Riviera"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Plitvice National Park"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Žumberak"]]}," – mountainous region that spans the border between Slovenia and Croatia"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Croatian National Theatre Zagreb 1.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["right"],["Croatian National Theatre in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zagreb"]]}]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Zut srednji kanal.jpg"],["300px"],["thumb"],["right"],["Croatia has 1244 islands"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Hvar from Fortica.JPG"],["300px"],["thumb"],["right"],["City of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hvar"]]}," has average of 2726 hours of sunshine per year, likewise many other Croatian towns on Adriatic coast.

Some local roads in Istria have been worn down to a smooth surface from regular wear and tear, and can be extremely slippery when wet. It's difficult to find a true highway with more than one way per direction, the only exceptions being the ones connecting Rijeka, Zagreb, Osijek, Zadar and Split. Speed limits are thus low (60–90 km\/h), and it's not recommended to drive faster (although most locals do), especially at night. Be aware of animals crossing the road.\nIn case you want to overtake a slow vehicle on a narrow road, often the drivers in front of you will set the right yellow turning lights, and drive on the very right side, to sign the drivers behind, that it is ok to overtake. But on your own risk.  \n\nRenting a car is around the same price as in the EU (from around €40). Almost all cars have a manual transmission.  Most rental agencies in the Balkans allow you to rent a car in one country and drive in the neighboring countries however try to avoid a renting a car in Serbia and driving it into Croatia (or vice versa) in order to avoid negative attention from nationalists.\n\nOn the recently built Croatian Motorways ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.croatia-expert.com\/2009\/03\/toll-croatian-highway\/"]}," toll fees apply (and may be paid in either HRK or EUR).

Note that to reach southern Dalmatia including Dubrovnik, you need to cross a short portion of Bosnia-Herzegovina, so check if you need a visa or other special requirements for entry into Bosnia (EU and US citizens don't need a visa). Another major motorway is the A3, linking the Slovenian border (not far from Zagreb) with eastern Croatia and the Serbian border (120 km from Belgrade). The general speed limit on motorways is 130 km\/h. You will probably encounter cars driving much faster, but following their example is of course highly unsafe.\n\nWhen exiting a toll motorway, ask the receipt at toll booth if it is not given to you to be sure you do not get overcharged (you could receive along with the receipt some unexpected change compared with the price you were given verbally)\n\nIf an unknown person flashes their car lights at you it may be a sign that they've recently passed a police unit doing speed limit checks. Ensure you are in compliance with all the traffic rules and regulations to avoid being stopped and fined.\n\nTrying to find a parking space near Croatia's coastal old towns in the summer can be an exercise in futility.

Croatian taxis are generally rather expensive.    \n\nYou can also book the transportation in advance which is great when you are in a hurry or have a larger number of people in need of transportation, or you just want everything organized in advance.\n\nYou can also prearrange a taxi service by E-mail in advance to have even more comfort and to save money since this taxi operators are cheaper than the regular taxi service.

A good way is to book a package with a company at home, although many Croatian companies also offer both bareboat and crewed charters.\n\nBooking of a charter vessel is basically done in two parts. Fifty percent of the charter price is paid right away, after which the booking is confirmed. The other fifty percent of the charter fee is usually paid four weeks before the charter date. Before the first payment of the charter fee you should request to see the charter contract from the agency where you chartered a boat. Pay close attention to cancellation fees because many times if you cancel your charter vacation you could lose the initial fifty percent you already payed when you booked a charter so take a close look at that in the charter contract.  After that you are set for a sailing vacation.\n\nWhen you arrive to marina where your chartered yacht is situated you need to do the check in (usually Saturday around 16:00) and you have to do the shopping for the charter vacation. Don't neglect the groceries shopping because the sea is unpredictable and you don't want to get stuck on the boat without anything to eat or drink.\n\nYou can do the shopping in a marina (although the prices are much higher there) or you can order from yacht provisioning services who usually deliver the products to your chartered yacht at no extra fee.
