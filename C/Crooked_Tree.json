The lagoon gets a lot closer if it rains so be sure and park well away from the water's edge. Rates are reasonable at USD $40-$80. The rooms are clean but a bit spartan. A\/C is not in all rooms and the heat and humidity can be a bit much if you are not used to sleeping without it in the tropics. The staff is very friendly. There are signs pointing you to the Lodge and everyone in the village knows the location anyways. The roads to the lodge are poor, at best, and any heavy rain will render them impassable to anything less than a 4WD. Even then, typical rental cars like the Suzuki Grand Vitara have gotten stuck in the roads. The Lodge takes all major credit cards."]]}]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Belize District"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Crooked Tree, Belize"]]}]
