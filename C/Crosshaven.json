Crosshaven House, formerly the residence of the local Squires, The Hayes Family was built in the same period.\n\nIn the late 19th century a convent and school were built, along with the Catholic and Anglican churches, and the Grand Hotel.\n\nIn the early 20th century, tourism became important to the town's economy with the arrival of the train and the new fashion for visiting beaches. Around this time the Majorca Ballroom was built.\n\nIn 1938 the British left Crosshaven and control of the forts passed to the Free State Army. After the war the train service was discontinued and though the spread of private cars brought other destinations to within reach of Cork residents, the town remained popular with tourists.\n\nIn 1966, The Royal Cork Yacht Club, which claims to be the oldest in the World, having been established in Cobh in 1720, moved across the harbour to Crosshaven. Around the same time, the \"Slobland\", an area of silt in front of Crosshaven house was filled in to become a car park.\n\nIn the 1970s and 2000s Crosshaven experienced two construction booms which caused a massive increase in population. The even more explosive growth in the population of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Carrigaline"]]},", 8km closer to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cork"]]}," City, inhibited its growth as a commercial centre.\n\nCrosshaven has a reputation for being bourgeois, partly as a result of the presence of the Yacht Club, but in reality has a fairly broad population demographic.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Orientation"]},"\n\nComing from Cork City, the Yacht Club is passed on the left and the Grand Hotel on the right. Most of the shops, pubs and restaurants are on Lower Road and The Square, from which two roads lead to the beaches at Graball and Church Bay. Another road leads from behind The Grand Hotel to the beaches at Myrtleville, Fennel's Bay and Fountainstown.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car or bicycle"]},"\n\nThe R612 leads from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cork"]]}," City to Crosshaven through ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Carrigaline"]]},", which can be bypassed.
