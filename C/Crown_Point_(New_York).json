The flat coastal plain made early settlement relatively easy as did the short distance to their Vermont homes. They traveled back and forth between their established Vermont farms and this new land as they cleared the ground, built log cabins and prepared to move their families. To this day, residents of Crown Point still commute to work in Vermont. The narrowness of the lake passage at Crown Point, currently spanned by the bridge, was of crucial strategic importance. The French began building a fort at this location as early as 1731. The name of the town is attributed to a translation of the French fort name; Point au Chevalure (the crown of the head). Crown Point was an industrialized community with fine houses, lawyers, doctors, stores and an academy for training teachers, when the Civil War engulfed the country. Unlike the earlier wars, the town wasn’t directly trampled by soldiers in battles, yet it gained fame from the number of its citizens who went to fight in the conflict, and from the Morgan horses it supplied to the Union Army. Three of the most famous horses, Pink, Billy, and Jeff, survived the war, returned to Crown Point and are buried there. By the end of the 20th century, the iron veins showed signs of exhaustion and the company was sold. The Essex County fish hatchery, where stock is grown, is located in Crown Point. History seeking tourists, boaters and bicyclists are drawn to the town. At the millennium, local residents, as well as entrepreneurs escaping urban life, have reestablished cottage industries in the town.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nI-87 North to exit 28.
