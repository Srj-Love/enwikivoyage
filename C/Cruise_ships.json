Some people love them, and some people hate them, but they're worthy of consideration, especially if you find other modes of travel too difficult or inconvenient. They make it easy to visit several places in a single trip without the need to repack your belongings and sit in a car\/train\/bus\/plane to travel to each one; your hotel comes along with you...cabin, meals and transportation. You may go to bed in Cabo San Lucas and wake up in Puerto Vallarta, which is a great convenience and experience.  Your sense of where you are is compromised only by not taking note of your itinerary.\n\nSeeing several cities, islands or areas in a region can help you decide if and where you'd want to visit later for a longer time. Typical cruise itineraries limit the time you spend in each place, usually just a day of activities or sightseeing. They may also include one or more days at sea...paradise if you enjoy a relaxing day by the pool, but less so if you prefer more active and open exploration. Nonetheless, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks for enough people to support a growing industry.\n\nToday you can visit every continent on earth, including ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Antarctica"]]},", by cruise ship. The most exotic itineraries, such as the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Galapagos Islands"]]},", are best visited by small expedition vessels.  While these cruises are expensive, you'll be traveling with expert guides.\n\nAs you may note already, ",{"type":"'''","value":["this article focuses on ocean cruising and ships."]},"  A parallel article (to be developed) would focus on river boat and barge canal cruising.

It owns Carnival Cruise Lines, Princess Cruises, Holland America, Cunard Line, Costa Cruises and Seabourn Cruises.

In truth, modern-day passenger ships, including Cunard Line's mammoth ",{"type":"''","value":["Queen Mary 2"]},", are actually now much larger and more luxurious than they were years ago.  The Cunard \"Queens\" still occasionally make traditional fast Atlantic crossings, e.g., between New York and England.

Due to economy of scale, most modern cruise ships carry 2,000 to 5,000 passengers.  While the luxury segment of the cruise industry boasts small ships...even \"boutique\" vessels or \"mega-yachts\"...most ships form floating towns or cities.  Voyages range from a few days to full circumnavigations of the globe lasting three months, while fares range from a few hundred dollars to $100,000 or more.\n\nLuxury cruise lines may have ships carrying just 100-800 or so passengers.  Larger ships carry 2,000-3,500 passengers, while mega-ships can carry over 5,000.  A mega-ship can weigh many times as much as the Titanic.

Cruising has turned into an enormously popular family vacation due to well-designed children's programs, even special cabin configurations.\n\nSome itineraries and cruise-lines may attract more seniors, e.g., trans-Atlantic and -Pacific re-positioning cruises, Holland-America (it very effectively supports but doesn't just market to seniors).  Reasons include cost, cruise length, numbers of days at sea, and dates that conflict with school.\n\nIf cruise demographics are important to you, read the cruise description carefully, research web sites on cruising (see \"Other resources\" below), and work through your travel\/cruise agent to learn the probable demographics of any trip you're considering.

The crew of your ship are all trained to calmly and efficiently handle any emergencies that may arise.  Occasionally, some considerable problems may even be discovered and repaired while going completely unnoticed by the passengers.\n\nThe press recants occasional incidents\/accidents that sometimes cause considerable potential passenger concern.  Yet, cruise accidents resulting in passenger deaths are very rare.  And all incidents are rare when one remembers that hundreds of ships are at sea at any moment.

",{"type":"'''","value":["Remain as orderly as you can and do not panic"]}," as you are evacuated; acting out of place will only make matters more complicated and increase your chance of injury.\n\nRemember to be aware of your surroundings at all times, especially at night. You shouldn't feel worried about going about on your own, but should be extra vigilant around bars where running into intoxicated passengers is a possibility and any altercation could escalate into a very dangerous situation. Keep an eye on your belongings and don't flaunt nor take them with you everywhere; leaving your iPod on a pool chair unattended while you quickly order a drink is just asking for someone to snatch it from you. Lock expensive items and jewelry in your cabin safe, then use or wear it only when appropriate. If you win a substantial amount of money in a ship's casino (unlikely, but not impossible), ask to have your earnings credited to your cruise account or given to you in the form of a check before disembarking, not in cash form for your wallet.\n\nFamilies traveling with children should be cautious as well. While family-friendly lines like Disney are \"age-proofed\" for their safety, other lines and older ships typically are not and there are many hazards that could put them in a dangerous situation; e.g. being left unsupervised on a balcony, falling down the stairs, swimming in a pool without a lifeguard, etc.  Older teenagers should be given some freedom about what they'd like to do and where they want to relax during the cruise, but you should always know the whereabouts of younger children.  Some ships even offer two-way \"walkie talkies\" for rent for your group to stay in-touch on-board.\n\nPiracy incidents are virtually nonexistent in the regions of the world where most cruise lines sail (",{"type":"[[","value":[["North America"],["North"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South America"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Europe"]]},", etc.), but the issue can be a legitimate concern to cruisers sailing the waters off ",{"type":"[[","value":[["East Africa"]]}," and a few other locations. \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Always report anything suspicious or concerning to a crew member"]},"; they will investigate or get someone who can investigate the matter.
