To reduce fuel expense, the most common cruising boat is a sailboat.\n\nCruising for a few weeks or shorter times is common. Not all advice here is relevant if your home harbour is within easy reach.\n\nSome cruisers are \"long term\" and travel for many years, the most adventurous circling the globe over a period of five to ten years.  Others take a year or two off from work and school to experience the cruising lifestyle.\n\nDue to the transient nature of cruising, Cruisers form their own community.  Cruisers commonly, upon anchoring in a new area, will stop by nearby boats (in their dinghy) to introduce themselves and say \"hello\".  The classic icebreaker is to hail a boat in an anchorage and ask \"where there's good holding?\"  Many cruisers leaving an area are happy to trade charts with boats going in the opposite direction.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThere are several categories of small craft which may be used for cruising, including motor vessels and sailing vessels, both of which may operate over large ranges, and may cross oceans or circumnavigate the globe during a voyage, and smaller vessels, which may be used for day trips, overnight trips and short coastal and inland voyages. These include human powered boats, such as canoes and kayaks. \n\nWhen choosing a boat you should usually try and see if the smallest would suit. Prices rise very quickly with size and it is easy to want a boat that is too big to easily handle. You don't want too small a boat when cruising the ocean; 36 feet (11 m) was thought by some to be optimal in the late 1960s. Look for quality instead of size; your space will be limited anyway (unless you opt for a ship), but a well planned boat will do wonders with the space available – besides being more reliable.\n\nIf you are going to charter your boat unmanned, i.e. if you are going to be the skipper yourself, you might have to show some proof of competence. Formal qualifications are needed to skipper your own boat in some countries. Check what is needed.\n\nIn Europe the main document of qualification is the International Certificate for Operators of Pleasure Craft, which may allow skippering sailboats or powerboats, at sea or in rivers and canals, up to a certain size.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Sailboat cruising"]},"\nWith a sailboat you will usually not move quickly, but sailboats are often well suited for life on board – at sea. Cruising by the coast you will often leave in the morning and get to your destination in the evening. Most long journeys are made by sailing boats, as you do not have to worry about fuel consumption. Sailboats are also nearly always quite seaworthy.\n\nIf you are going to sail (some use sailboats hardly ever using the sails), you need some basic skills. The basics are easy to learn – you won't sail as fast as others, you will have to use the engine for mooring and in tight channels and you do not want to ride a storm by sail, but you will be able to learn more day by day. Invite a skilful sailor now and then and you will learn all the tricks also.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Open sailboat cruising"]},"\nWith an open sailboat you will probably not want to sleep or dine at sea, so you will have to find a harbour each night, even in good weather (and in bad weather you might want to stay on shore). On the other hand you can land almost anywhere and (with many open boats) easily take the boat on a trailer for land transport. Few people go for long journeys in open boats, but they are nice for exploring a lake or an archipelago once you are there.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Motorboat cruising"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Hull speed boats"]},"\nWith a ",{"type":"''","value":["displacement"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["hull-speed"]}," motorboat your pace will be about the same as if sailing. You will have less height and draught, about the same speed (but timetables will be more reliable) – and you will not sail. Some motorboats are for sheltered waters only, but some are suitable for the coasts and seas also. For oceans you need quite a big boat, able to carry enough fuel.\n\nSome recent designs can provide better speed than traditional displacement hulls at good fuel economy and comfortable sea-keeping by using long narrow hulls, often as a multi-hull arrangement. \n\nIt is not uncommon to use sailboats as hull-speed \"motorboats\". Most modern sailboats of decent size have adequate engines for motoring, and there are many more sailboats to choose from than motorboats suited for life at sea. Just do not use the sails – but keeping a few sails for pleasant winds, for stability in rough seas and for engine failures (and preferably learning to use them) is hardly a bad idea.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Planing boats"]},"\nWith a ",{"type":"''","value":["planing hull"]}," you will usually reach your destination more quickly. Typically overall distances will not be longer than with slower boats, but you will be able to go on quite long afternoon trips and spend more time at one-day destinations. And you might like the speed itself (but be considerate of those you pass). Fuel consumption and range will be an issue.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Kayak and canoe cruising"]},"\nKayaks and canoes can go almost anywhere. There are people who go for kayak or canoe journeys of several thousand kilometres. It is easy to skip less interesting or too demanding passages by taking a car ride. In the wilderness the kayak or canoe can be carried past rapids that are too wild and over short distances of land.\n\nThere are several types: sea kayaks are not good for rapids and vice versa, and some are made specially for beginners. There is a whole lot of not always obvious stuff to learn about security. Making good use of a canoe or kayak requires a lot of training, but less demanding trips can be made after a short introduction.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Destinations"]},"\nThe world is your oyster. At least those parts which have enough water to float your boat. Travelling is usually by sailing or motoring from one place to another, but in some cases vessels are transported by ship, road or rail to the cruising area of choice, where they are met by the crew. This allows transit across otherwise unsuitable terrain, like mountains and deserts, or over distances or through areas unsuitable for the specific vessel. In some cases folding canoes are even carried as baggage on aircraft, then used as a base for waterborne camping trips at the destination. Often it is possible to rent a suitable vessel at the destination, which usually is cheaper than bringing your own over large distances.\n\nIn some areas, small boats are a major part of the local transport system, especially in areas with many islands. For example, they are a common way to travel in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Indonesia"]]},", the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Philippines"]]}," and among the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South Pacific"]]}," islands. In other areas, such as the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Greek Islands"]]},", larger ferries are dominant in commercial transport, but there are small craft as well.

Many people are attracted to the romance of cruising, but find that they dislike the reality.\n\nFirst, take a few shorter trips with friends or take a class in sailing.  This will teach you the basics, and you'll see if you like to sail at all.  \n\nNext, buy a small dinghy (6–11 feet) with sails.  Sail it regularly.  If you keep wishing you could go farther, you might be a real cruiser.  You could also settle for shorter trips, which is what thousands of boaters do. If you dislike the sails, have a motor boat instead.\n\nNext, crew on a yacht, just for fun.  Local yacht clubs often have boats looking for crew.  It helps if you're a good cook, or good company.  Try to get references, and look the boat over.  Look for bad maintenance or safety problems.  If you see any, go later with someone else.  Never give your return plane ticket, passport or emergency money to other crew or the captain.  Consider taking your own GPS so you can detect unspoken deviations from the itinerary.\n\nIf you still dream about long cruises, take a class in celestial navigation.  GPS works, but careful navigators use a belt & suspenders approach:  They keep a continuous ",{"type":"[[","value":[["w:dead reckoning"],["dead reckoning"]]}," track using a compass and a distance-measurement device called a log, and use coastal landmarks, GPS and celestial navigation to correct it.  Careful navigation is needed to avoid stormy areas, shoals and other hazards.  Currents can carry you into these without any warning, unless you navigate carefully.\n\nEnjoyed the crewing?  Buy a ",{"type":"''","value":["small"]}," boat, maybe 30 feet. This is small enough that you can handle it yourself, and big enough to take a family or your mate to anywhere in the world.  Big boats are much more work; many rich people buy a big boat, and eventually sell it and get a smaller one because they are more fun.\n\nAbandoned yachts are for sale cheaply in many distant places like the Panama Canal, Gibraltar, and Singapore - check the gossip.  This happens because many people really do not like cruising, and thought they would.\n\nIntroduce your family to sailing with the ",{"type":"'''","value":["most pleasant cruise you can arrange!"]},"  Share the planning so everybody buys in to the trip.  Share the chores fairly, among everyone (captain takes a turn!).  After they're hooked, send your significant other to a class (your relationship will thank you).  Let the others take your dinghy out ",{"type":"''","value":["alone"]}," so they can love sailing, too.  Teach everyone how to manage all the parts of the boat.  This way they can get around even if you get sick.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Learn"]},"\nThere are a large number of training facilities throughout the world where you can learn the skills that are useful and necessary for cruising in small craft. These range from deckhand up to ocean navigation. Learning the skills of operating a sailing vessel is in itself often a reason for travel, as these schools are frequently in areas where the conditions are pleasant for a vacation.\n\nThe ability to cook a good meal at sea is highly valued in a member of the crew, as is ability to get recalcitrant engines to work, and cheerfulness when woken up in the middle of the night to stand watch on deck in a storm. The first two can be learned at schools or by experience. The third is something you either have or do not, and can vary from day to day.\n\nWikibooks has a manual for one yachting exam, the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/en.wikibooks.org\/wiki\/Yacht_Officer_Exam_Guide Yacht Officer Exam"]},". Certifications are often limited to a particular jurisdiction and a range of vessel sizes; the linked book, for example, is for an exam required for \"deck officers serving in all UK-registered yachts and sail training vessels of 24 metres and over in loadline length and under ",{"type":"{{","value":[["nowrap"],["3 000 GT\"."]]}," Of course, the training is useful even on other vessels, and a certification may help you get a berth anywhere.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Money"]},"\nMoney is the number-one problem for cruises of more than a few months. Conservative cruisers have several years of savings, and plan to work about one quarter a year. Most have or acquire skills that sell easily in many parts of the world, such as nursing, doctor or dentist, accounting, boat-maintenance handyman, sail-maker, welder or diesel mechanic. Some cruisers make a little money shipping wines, jewellery and the like, but most can't compete with large commercial firms.  Smuggling and other illegal incomes cause people to lose their boats. In 2002, very cost-conscious no-frills cruisers could maintain two people and a 28-foot boat on US$1000 per month.  This rate roughly doubled when in a port, partying with other cruisers.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Equipment & tips"]},"\nThere are two rather different schools concerning equipment:\n\n#I'm on vacation. Give me every comfort there is. I can afford it, and I can find a good mechanic if I have to.\n#I want the simplest boat I can get, so it will keep working (so I can go), and cost less (so I can stay away longer).\n\nCruising long-term is a way of life, not a vacation. Those who think it is a vacation are often disillusioned. When you visit a destination for a holiday week or two, you are an observer. You flit from place to place, having everything done for you, and never getting a true sense of the local way of life. A cruiser is a long-term voyager who becomes part of the local community as soon as the anchor is dropped. You may stay a day or two if you don't like the place, a week or two if a place is reasonably appealing, and a month or longer if it speaks to you. In general though, when it comes to equipment, it's all up to you and there is a fair bit of work involved. So be prepared to fix it, replace it, or do without it if something fails while underway. There are usually no plumbers, electricians or mechanics to call in remote places or while underway, so the cruiser who can fix things is likely to enjoy it and succeed. \n\nThere ",{"type":"''","value":["are"]}," some areas of agreement between the two points of view.

Mobile phones are generally limited to 19 nautical miles (35 km) from the base station, possibly extended in some areas. Goodbye most Internet connectivity. Marine VHF coast station connectivity extends to some 30–40 nautical miles (55–65 km) and offers emergency services, weather forecasts and the like, and in some countries connections to the telephone network.
