This state capital comes to life on weekends, where local life is combined with the presence of the floating population that comes, mostly, from Mexico City. It's also home to many foreign people who come to learn Spanish, and most young people will have a fairly big understanding of English because of this. Be prepared for many micro-climates inside the city and surroundings, where there have been variations of up to 10°C in less than a 8 km radius; while the lower zones can have very humid weather, the northern forest area will most certainly be cold by night.\n\nThe heart of the city is the central plaza and palace. Each night of the week you can enjoy dancers, musicians, acrobats and a lot of locals who use the plaza both by day and night as a place to hang out, meet friends and be entertained by many local artists and entertainers. The square and adjacent area is full of street vendors selling everything from beed work to maize on a stick and tacos.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nGetting to Cuernavaca is fairly easy but beware the traffic in the Mexico-Cuernavaca-Acapulco tollway on Friday and Sunday afternoons.

It is also possible to catch a bus from the main toll plaza at the south of the city. Buses run on average every 20 minutes and tickets cost around $68 pesos to $135 from the Airport. Pullman de Morelos runs the most frequent routes. Buses are modern and safe and come equipped with air conditioning, toilets, and a movie during the trip.

These are not particularly comfortable, but are relatively safe and regularly used by the many foreign language students in the city. Alternatively, there are many taxis which can be hailed on the street or ordered by phone or board them at base stations. One of the largest radio taxi firms in Cuernavaca is Citlali. Radio taxis are safer if you call (as opposed to hailing) them, as a record of your pick-up is registered by a dispatcher. Independent taxis lack this documentation and are slightly more risky. Taxis in Cuernavaca do not have meters and prices need to be arranged before getting in the taxi. Most destinations during the day will cost between $25 and $45 pesos. At night prices sky-rocket (double) and trying to get a taxi in the early hours of the morning will often cost substantially more.

About 10 miles south of the city is Xochicalco, a large, beautiful and well-restored archeological site.  The nearby Tepozteco mountains and the village of Tepoztlan are very popular destinations for locals and tourists with attractions that include a XVI century Dominican convent, museum, many restaurants and handicrafts.\nCuernavaca has a number of language schools where you may enroll in intensive Spanish language study.\n\nAlso  only in season (check to see if it is available) is Rafting at the Amacuzac River with class III & IV white water rapids operated  by Raft Mexico - Plaza Dafne, Av.

Las Mañanitas is a Relais & Chateaux hotel with excellent if somewhat dated cuisine on a menu that never changes. Famous for its large garden with free-roaming peacocks and other large birds, Las Mañanitas is well worth a visit for cocktails or a meal. On the main square facing the Palacio de Cortes is Casa Hidalgo also serving excellent food.  These restaurants serve a variety of dishes consisting of traditional Mexican and international fare.  Trattoria Marco Polo, across the street from the cathedral, serves good Italian food and pizza.  For about $60 US, Marco Polo offers a very large pizza (about 3 feet wide) loaded with everything.  Definitely not something would find in Italy, it is however a sight to see and excellent to try if you are eating with a large group there.  El Faisan on Emiliano Zapata is another excellent high-end restaurant featuring Yucatecan food that is worthwhile visiting when in Cuernavaca.  La Provence in a boutique hotel of the same name a short distance south of the zocolo is Cuernavaca's leading French restaurant.\n\nIn the downtown 30m down the street Calle Fray Bart De Las Casas from Plazuela del Zacate, on the right hand side on corner, there is a small nameless place with open grill that has indescribably delicious arrachera and tortas\/hamburguesas. $135 for arrachera as of March 2011.  For the best hamburgers in town, however, you'll need to go to either La Casa de Hamburguesa on Teopanzolco (inexpensive) or Meson Gaucho (expensive), on Domingo Diez across from Cuernavaca's only Walmart store, which features Argentine steaks in addition to the great burgers.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["Bars"]},"Los Arcos on the Zocalo is popular on Tuesdays when students converge on the open bar\/cafe with live salsa music and cheap drink. For a more sophisticated evening try Reposado with its comfortable lounge beds in a beach-style setting with a restaurant on the ground level. [REPOSADO IS NOW CLOSED] La Bola is a typical Mexican cantina with live Norteno and Mariachi music every night between 7 and 10PM. 2 for one promotions daily between 2 and 9PM and very cheap food\/drink packages. On average $400 pesos buys a generous plate of food for the table to share and a bottle of alcohol or 20 bottles of beer. Nachos is another example of a cantina famous for its very large glasses also try Clamatoria. [As of March 2011 Nachos had quit] La Taurina and Crudalia are very simple bars that sell cheap booze by the litre. Expect plastic tables and chairs and very few frills but a good atmosphere.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["Night Clubs"]},"On the weekends an influx of visitors arrive in Cuernavaca from Mexico City and head to the night clubs. El Alebrije is a chain of nightlubs with a branch in Cuernavaca. It is frequented primarily by a wealthy and young crowd. Cover is $100 pesos with prices for bottles starting at $700 pesos. The door staff at high-end clubs are often quite difficult. Men arriving without female companionship at a club will generally have trouble getting although foreigners are often given preference. Alebrije is open on Fridays and Saturdays, doors open at 10PM. Barbazul is a large indoor\/outdoor venue with a cf $100 after midnight. Like Alebrije it is frequented by a young and wealthy crowd and many foreigners. Taizz is the highest end club with a cover of $200 pesos. As with the previous two it is frequented by a similar crowd. All the clubs have valet parking and taxis outside, however these tend to charge a lot. Bottle prices are generally the same in the 3 venues. It is usual to order a bottle and occupy a table and few people buy individual drinks at the bar. Tipping the waiter is essential and problems may arise if the waiter feels he has been undertipped - 10% is the accepted amount. These three clubs play an eclectic mix of music from 80's Mexican music to American Hip Hop. Mambo cafe is open Wednesday to Saturday with Salsa sance classes on Wednesdays between 6 and 9PM. The most popular night for Mambo cafe is Thursday when it is often very full. The Store is a new club and very different from the first three. Very basic the club has no waiters and is self-service from the bar. It is popular and well attended. In all the clubs either inside the grounds or directly outside are stalls selling hotdogs and hamburgers and tacos are never far away. Most clubs close their doors at 3AM and do not allow access after this hour. However it is usual for the last person to leave the clubs at around 5 or 6AM. In most clubs in Cuernavaca women do not pay cover.\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["drink"],["name=enrique"],["url="],["email=enriquedelapena38@yahoo.com"],["address=2460 arbour trace terrace suwanee GA 30024"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=6785163059"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=8AM-10PM"],["price=60.00 mx"],["content=if you want to have a cheap dinner,go to VIP'S is just down the street from zocalo on Benito Juarez street,servise is good and friendly."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["drink"],["name=Pimuco"],["url="],["email="],["address=calle Ignacio Rayon 22 - pasaje Florencia"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=close to the Cathedral"],["phone=777-3105853"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=12-23"],["price=$100"],["content=500 meters from the Cathedral,close to the Cine Morelos, there is this nice art-cafe' in an old traditional house, with a beautiful and green courtyard.They prepare good sandwiches and pastas.Good music and a long list of cultural events(live jazz concert,theatre,literature)."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["drink"],["name=casa frida"],["alt=mexican and prehispanic food"],["url="],["email="],["address=carretera fed a mexico km 69"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=close to glorieta buena vista"],["phone=7772795370"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=10AM to 8PM"],["price="],["content=an old house full of art and colors,real mexican food and prehispanic dishes like ,iguana ,wild pig, snake etc..local beers and pulque"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nIf you are in Cuernavaca, you can stay for example in the\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Budget"]},"\nCuernavacas budget hotel row is in Calle Aragon y Leon.
