It was not unusual to see folks on the street in cowboy duds, but through recent years, Cuiaba has been greately modernized. And, it's a great place to stock up on boots, saddles, and other western gear. The city serves as the main gateway to the northern part of the Pantanal—the Transpantaneira Highway starts just 98 km (61 miles) away—and as the jumping-off point to the Chapada dos Guimarães. However While in The City There is So much to do and see. three spacious shopping malls, Amazing restaurants, and A late night clubs. Not to mention The Beautiful open downtown center where you can find live music, open air shopping, street vendors,and fresh coconut water.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nCuiabá was founded on April 8, 1719 as the capital of Mato Grosso State.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nMost people arrive in Cuiabá and immediately leave on a Pantanal tour. The hotels, sights, and restaurants all within walking distance of the town center. The main hotel neighborhood and center of town is quite safe. The only part of town to avoid is along the riverside. Taxis are inexpensive — R$7 to R$21 to get around town — and they're quick for getting out to the airport or bus station. Lodges will usually arrange transportation and pickup from hotels.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Driving the Transpantaneira"]}," -- There are a couple of ironies about the Transpantaneira. Though the name implies that the road traverses the entire flood plain, the highway stops in Porto Jofre, 144 km (89 miles) from where it began, and at least that far from the opposite edge of the Pantanal. The other irony is that the project, which if completed would likely have destroyed the Pantanal (by skewing the ecosystem's drainage pattern), has instead, in its unfinished state, become one of the great wildlife-viewing areas of the world. Ditches on either side of the roadbed have become favorite feeding grounds for kingfishers, capybara, egrets, jabiru storks, giant river otters, and caiman by the dozen. Spend but a day on the Transpantaneira, and you'll see more wildlife than you'd see in a week in the Amazon.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Sights in Cuiabá"]}," - The excellent Secretaria de Turismo gives out a very detailed map showing all the various sights in Cuiabá, complete with pictures.

Directly northeast of Praça República, there's a small shopping district, centered on Rua Eng. Ricardo Franco.
