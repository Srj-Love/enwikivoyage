For a monthly mortgage payment, the homes included furniture, dishes, a record player, and sometimes even a Model T. In the 1920s, silent film comedy producer Hal Roach and Metro Goldwyn Mayer (MGM) built studios. By the 1930s, Culver City boasted three major film studios, including MGM, and was  publicized as the \"Heart of Screenland.\" During the 1930s through the 1940s Culver City was home to half of America's motion picture production.\n\nHundreds of movies have been produced on the lots of Culver City's studios, including the Tarzan series and the original King Kong. The yellow brick road from The Wizard of Oz is still inside the lot on Stage 27 of Sony Studios. More recent films include Grease, Raging Bull, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, City Slickers, Wag the Dog and Contact. Television shows made on Culver City sets include Lassie, I Love Lucy, Batman, The Andy Griffith Show and Jeopardy!. Wheel of fortune is spinning there too.\n\nOutside of the studios, Culver City is mostly composed of middle-class homes that were originally built to house studio workers, with street names reflecting this heritage, such as (Mary) Pickford and (Douglas) Fairbanks.  The downtown area has been undergoing a rejuvenation since the late 1990s with new restaurants, art galleries, theaters and shops that attract a large number of visitors from the local area.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nCulver City is the western terminus of the Metro Rail Expo Line to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Los Angeles\/Downtown"],["Downtown LA"]]},".
