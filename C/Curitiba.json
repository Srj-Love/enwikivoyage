In the central area, there are many one-way streets, parking restrictions as well as pedestrian-only and bus-only streets. Bus lanes are very common in Curitiba, as the city has over 60 km (38 miles) of them. Most avenues are wide and have spacious sidewalks and they are mostly laid out in a grid system in the city center area.\n\nPublic transportation is probably the best option for those visiting the city. The fare is R$ 2.60 (€ 1.00 \/ US$ 1.30) and R$ 1.00 (€ 0.40 \/ U$ 0.60) on Sundays, and you can connect for free between the bus routes if you connect inside the bus depots or the tube stations. There are also special services, like the City Center Circulator, which costs only R$ 1.50 (€ 0.60 \/ US$ 0.75), the Touristic Route, which serves more than 20 attractions and allows each rider visit 4 of them paying only one fare, although expensive (R$ 27.00), and the Airport Shuttle, operated with mini-buses between Curitiba downtown and Afonso Pena Airport (R$ 8.00).\n\nActually the best way to come from the airport to downtown is a city bus lane called \"aeroporto\", which final stop is on the tube just next to the airport's main entrance. The fare is R$ 2.60, cheaper than the Airport Shuttle (R$ 10.00) and way cheaper than by taxi (R$ 50.00).\n\nThe public bus system is generally good in comparison with other Brazilian capitals, but overcrowded in rush hours.\n\nAfter midnight, most buses stop circulating.

There are some metereological issues that makes long periods of a permanent light rain or drizzle, which may comprises several weeks, typically foggy and grey, barely similar as London. \n\nSnow is very rare and the last precipitations took part in 1975. But there's lots of sites in 3h or 4h of traveltime that snows every year, specially Palmas (300 km) and São Joaquim (400 km). Frost, nevertheless, is very common within the city limits and produces painting-like landscapes in the urban parks, notably Barigui Park and Jardim Botânico (until 8AM, before the sunlight starts to melt the frost)\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Curitiba Trainride with the Serra Verde Express.JPG"],["thumb"],["300px"],["View from the Serra Verde Express"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["The ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.serraverdeexpress.com.br\/ Serra Verde Express"]}]},", a train to the coastal town of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Morretes"]]},", makes an excellent day trip and is for many tourists the main reason to visit Curitiba.
