Flat Rock Park, Currumbin Alley and the Throwers Dr Park all have public barbecues and cooking facilities (namely a sink, tap water and boiling water). Currumbin's main beach and 'The Alley' are patrolled by lifeguards during the week and volunteer lifesavers on weekends. With strong rips common along the main beach, the Alley provides a safer swimming and family option.

Immediately south of the Air Sea Rescue, behind the swing set is a hidden set of stairs which leads up to a panoramic lookout of Gold Coast beaches and coast. The climb is approximately 200 steps and beware of dawn and dusk - when the eager exercise boot camps are utilising the workout! Consequently the car parking at these times can be difficult.
