It is quite crowded during this time and chances are that you may not be allowed to travel in your vehicle through most of the parts of the city. If you have time and you are fit enough, just settle for walking throughout the city.\n\nCuttack was established more than 1000 years ago as a military establishment. You can still see the remnants in the old city. There is a fort which is still being excavated by the ASI. Cuttack is said to have survived a dangerous past due to the presence of Maa Cuttack Chandi and Maa Gada Chandi who guard the cities from the evil eyes and the mighty Mahanadi.
