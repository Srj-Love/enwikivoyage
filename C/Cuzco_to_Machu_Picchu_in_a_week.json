Most will allow you to mix and match different options, such as driver and guide, budget accommodations, luxury accommodations, etc. Another option would be to hire a taxi for the days you want to be on your own. Because of the altitude, you don’t want to do too much walking early on. It's common for guides and drivers to eat with their clients at meals.

Altitude sickness is common here, so take it easy today, and carry water wherever you go. Once you're settled in, you will find a wealth of places to eat in Cuzco but we recommend that you head over to Tunupa for lunch; they offer some of the best guinea pig or alpaca dishes from the local Novo Andino cuisine as well as other local specialities. \n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Tunupa"],["url="],["email="],["address=233 Portal Confituría"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=51-84-25-2936"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=lunch entrées, $9–$17"],["content="]]}]},"\nIf you're feeling good, stop at a market for a bottle of wine (all of Peru's labels are inexpensive, but Tacama is the most reliable).

You'll soon be in a breathtaking landscape: silvery eucalyptus, purplish clay slopes, and the slate-green Urubamba River. Arrange to get dropped off at the Pisac ruins' higher parking lot and walk to the Intihuatana (Sun Temple). Note the caves in the cliff to your right: They are South America's largest pre-Columbian cemetery. Return to the parking lot via the lower path. Then head to contemporary ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pisac"]]}," to spend half an hour at the market. Get to the restaurant Allpamanka, in Yucay, for lunch by 12:30PM which offers a lunch buffet that is popular with tour bus companies; try a local specialty such as causa, a potato casserole. After lunch, head to Moray, a fabulous depression in which, experts theorize, the Incas built concentric terraces to grow crops in different microclimates. Feel free to explore. At the end of the day, rather than head back to Cuzco, get dropped off at the Sol y Luna Lodge & Spa.

This is one of the world's most rewarding day-hikes. The final climb brings you to Intipunku, the Sun Gate, where you achieve your first and most picturesque view of Machu Picchu. Remember that this portion must be booked through a tour group operator. Wake early so that you can get to the train station in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ollantaytambo"]]}," to catch the 8:05 train. Most tour group companies can arrange for tickets to a stop called KM 104, an hour away. Make sure you have water since there will not be any on the Trail. Follow your guide up to the ruins of Huinay Huayna, (‘Forever Young’), to join the Incas' classic highway from Cuzco to Machu Picchu. Stop here for a snack and water, but save your lunch for the Sun Gate, another hour away. You will find that the Trail is fairly easy until you reach the Sun Gate where you climb a flight of 50 stairs. Machu Picchu is most crowded at midday and clears out by 4PM, when the last train heads back to Cuzco, so take your time finishing the hike. Late afternoon is the prettiest time to wander through the intricate stonework. The guards will herd you out at around 5:15, and the last bus down to Aguas Calientes, at the foot of Machu Picchu, departs shortly after the gates close. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Aguas Calientes"]]}," is a boring tourist town with a budget hostel, but crossing the bridge to the Inkaterra Machu Picchu Hotel makes you feel like you are entering Paradise. We recommend that you get a room with an outdoor shower, where the water flows Inca-style from a groove carved into a rock.

Sunrise at the ruins is no secret, but we recommend that while your fellow early risers are gathering at the watchtower, head to the other high point, the Intihuatana (it offers the best vistas, and you'll have it all to yourself). Begin touring with your guide by 7AM so you can be on your way up Huayna Picchu—the sugarloaf in the background—by 10AM It's a steep 45-minute climb, but it ends with another great panorama. Plenty of people take the main route up, but have your guide show you the little-used trail down, via a cave once thought to be the Temple of the Moon. You should be back in time to beat the crowds to the Tinkuy Buffet Restaurant, just outside the gates. After lunch, do a circuit of the restaurant's poster-size photographs from Hiram Bingham's 1911 \"discovery' of Machu Picchu. Head back into the ruins for a proper farewell, then take the bus down to the Inkaterra hotel in time for a complimentary pisco sour (Peru's national cocktail) in the lounge and dinner.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Tinkuy Buffet Restaurant"],["url="],["email="],["address=Machu Picchu main entrance"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=51-84-21-1039"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=lunch buffet, $22"],["content="]]}]},"\nDay 5: The ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sacred Valley of the Incas"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cuzco"]]}," - The best way out of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Aguas Calientes"]]}," is on the morning train to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ollantaytambo"]]}," where, if you wanted, a short bus ride to Cuzco is available. The train doesn't leave ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Aguas Calientes"]]}," until 8:35AM, reaching ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ollantaytambo"]]}," at 10:05. The main square in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ollantaytambo"]]}," is usually swarming with hikers and porters, but a few blocks away is a vibrant community still living in pre-Columbian dwellings. If you still have a guide, see if he can take you into one of these houses, where alpaca fetuses hang on the walls (to bring fertility), ancestors' skulls watch over the goings-on from niches in the Incan stonework, and dozens of guinea pigs scoot underfoot (the entrée at some future feast). After checking out the temple ruins across the river, head to lunch at El Huacatay, in nearby ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Urubamba"]]},", where you'll feel like you're a guest in the owner's home. On your way back to Cuzco, stop in the village of Chinchero. The market is only on Sundays, but there are usually women in the plaza arranging their crafts for the bus tourists who come through later, and the shops sell fine weaving at low prices. Don't forget to peek into the elaborately frescoed nineteenth-century church. You should be back in Cuzco by five. Once back at your hotel, make a 7:30 dinner reservation at the stylish Museo de Arte Precolombino's glass-capsule café. The exquisite primitive art collection is open until ten.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=El Huacatay"],["url="],["email="],["address=620 Girón Arica, Urubamba"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=51-84-201-790"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=entrées, $8–$11"],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Museo de Arte Precolombino cafe"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=51-84-23-3210"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=entrées, $8–$22"],["content="]]}]},"\nDay 6: ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cuzco"]]}," - Follow the locals to the Mercado San Pedro this morning.

The surrounding cattle ranches mean fewer wild animals, but the huts are plusher and there's a masseuse. Reserva is also a better option if you have only two nights (although three is ideal in either location) because the 30-minute charter flights to Manu are highly undependable.

Instead of catching the train to Machu Picchu on Day 3, drive to the trailhead of the Urubamba Weavers' Route. This hike from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ollantaytambo"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lares"]]}," takes you through villages unchanged for centuries. The first camp lies in the shadow of 17,400-foot Terijuay. The middle of Day 2 marks the high point of the trek, literally-14,764 feet-after which a gradual descent leads through potato fields and into the tiny village of Cochayoq. Midway through Day 3, the trek reaches Lares and then you are returned to the Sol y Luna Lodge & Spa.\n\nIt is trecommended that you purchase the services of a treking company for this hike since it is at such a high altitude. This is a moderate-to-strenuous trek, with four to six hours of hiking on each of three days and recommended for experienced hikers only. Although the spongy moss underfoot makes this a relatively low-impact route-the Inca Trail, in comparison, is paved with stones-the altitude is a challenge. If you do have trouble, you can always take a hit of oxygen from your guide's canister or jump on the \"ambulance horse.\" If serious symptoms persist, getting to a lower altitude is essential. \n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["related"],["Southern Sierra (Peru)"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Usableitinerary"]]}]
