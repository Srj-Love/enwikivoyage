[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Kobenhavn cykelby banner.jpg"]]},"\nCycling allows you to see places close up and at a slower pace. It keeps you aware of your surroundings and you get to experience a place more intimately than you would as a bus or taxi passenger. You'll see more of street life and meet people going about their daily business.  It is also a great way to return from your holidays fitter and healthier than when you left.\n\nCycling is becoming easier in many western countries for both getting around town or for long distance touring. In Europe, Canada and America, money is being invested in converting old railways, building dedicated cycleways and putting in cycle lanes on busy roads.  In Asia and Africa, the pattern is very different. In China, Vietnam and India, the bicycle was often the dominant mode of transport. Here, cycling is in decline, and has been thought of as a sign of past poverty. There is some signs of a return to  bike transport in these countries, because of congestion and health benefits, particularly in China. Even in India, cycling is beginning to benefit as it is taken up by parts of the middle classes.\n\nIn Africa, the bike has been marginalised for a long time, despite being a cheap way to provide local mobility.\n\nFor tourists and adventurers, there are definitely better and worse places to cycle, but there's not many places you can't reach by bike.\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Understand "]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Touring routes"]},"\nYou can tour by yourself, or you can go with a commercial guided tour.
