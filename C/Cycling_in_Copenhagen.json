With almost unrivalled bike infrastructure, certainly outside the Netherlands, and a mind blowing number of cyclists and bicycles, Copenhagen is a prime example on how cities can rid itself of its oil addiction. Dozens how bicycle enthusiasts, traffic professionals, bicycle evangelicals and environmentalists have made a pilgrimage to the city, in fact 11% of tourists arriving in the city, state that they have come to witness what is known as bicycle nirvana, though its not without its problems. If you are already in the city for unrelated reasons, trust us, there is no better way to get around the city's attraction, than breezing along the bicycle tracks feeling like a local for brief moment. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Understand "]},"\nThe first bicycles descended on Copenhagen from France in the 1890s and in the space of just 17 years, Copenhagen became the hotspot of bicycling in Europe, and until the 1950s the cyclists of the city never looked over their shoulder, and their numbers continued to balloon until Henry Ford's model T, became cheap enough to be sufficiently attractive to appeal to human laziness and yearning for status. For nearly 3 decades Copenhagen then followed the path of most other cities in the world, and the famous bicycle girl who had adorned the classic tourist posters, withered, and became increasingly unattractive to the city's populace. \n\nIt took two oil crisis in the 1970’s before the citizens of Copenhagen again opened their eyes to her simplistic beauty, and decided to take a different path than their peers around the world. Massive demonstrations to demand space on the roads for bicycles ensued, and slowly but steadily the town hall stearred Copenhagen down the road that would lead to Copenhagen becoming one of the leading cities of bicycles in the world, along with its Dutch sister Amsterdam. \n\nTime flew by, global warming revealed its ugly face, Copenhageners continued to bike like they had done for decades, in increasing numbers but without making much of a racket about the fact, until in the 2000s a Canadian photographer revived the old bicycle girl, this time in the modern incarnation of Cycle Chic, and the world began to take note, mayors of world cities like New York and London biked the streets Copenhagen for inspiration, presidents came, CNN came and suddenly Copenhagenization had entered the vernacular of global dialogue. \n",{"type":"===","value":[" Etiquette "]},"\nWhile Copenhagen is often hailed as bicycle Nirvana, its not all a dance on roses. There are more bicycles than people in Copenhagen, so biking in the streets of Copenhagen can, and probably will feel,  intimidating for even experienced cyclists, as cyclists mostly bike in a brisk pace without much leeway, in a carefully orchestrated ballet of sorts - It takes very little to mess up the harmony. If you have not biked in a city with the modal share of Copenhagen before, you should probably skip the rush hour (7.30-9 and 15-17), even if you consider yourself an experienced cyclist.\n\nAnd even outside rush hour there is an etiquette - strictly policed, heavily fined laws - to follow.

Another 500 meters down the road the long yellow wall of the Assistant cemetery appears on the right, a popular picnic spot during the summer, and the final resting place of cultural giants H.C. Andersen and Kirkegård. Continue ahead until you reach ‘The Red Square’ as locals have dubbed it, if you are interested in urban design, the Superkilen park which stretches 500 meters north is a good place to explore. Once done, head south on the Nørrebro cykelrute (",{"type":"[[","value":[["#See"],["see"]]},"), after about 1,5 km you will reach the Åbuen bridge (",{"type":"[[","value":[["#See"],["see"]]},") and another 1 km later you’ll reach a large shopping centre and metro station on Falkoner Allé, turn left here, and after about 5 minutes you’ll reach Frederiksberg Park, along the street there are many family (some would call it beer-) gardens, which is good place to break for lunch, a little later there the road up the hill will take you to Frederiksberg Palace, Cisternerne and the Zoological gardens (see Frederiksberg for details). Continue down Pilé Alle, and just when the road make a right turn, turn left down the cobblestoned street (Ny Carlsbergvej), which will take you through the old Carlsberg brewery and the iconic Elephant gate. Continue straight ahead, across the wide boulevard, until you reach the train tracks, and follow them left for another 500 meters, until you can cross them on the bridge at Dybbølsbro station. Here it gets a bit tricky but at the end of the bridge, take your bike down the stairs (there is a ramp for bikes) at the Fisketorvet shopping centre, and continue along its eastern edge, and soon you will be at the beautiful ‘bryggebroen’ bike bridge (",{"type":"[[","value":[["#See"],["see"]]},"), across the harbour. Turn left and follow the harbour towards the city, during the summer the Islands Brygge park is full of life and people swimming in the harbour.

As you reach the lakes, you will pass an white old beautiful building, now a nightclub it was build in 1896 as the home of the Copenhagen Iceskating Union. At the end of the lake, turn right to follow the cycle track along the lakes, hailing back to the 1910s this bicycle track is among the first build bicycle infrastructure build by the city, as you continue along the lakes two tunnels will take you under the crossing streets, the end of the lakes is a good rest stop at the two cafés with lakeside seating. Turn right along the end of the lakes, and then make a left at the signalled intersection down Classensgade. This street is one of few in Copenhagen to have painted bike lanes rather than the standard raised bicycle tracks, but notice how you still have parked cars to protect you from traffic. Follow the street all the way to the train tracks at the end, where you should turn right down the lovely bidirectional cycle track until you reach the bicycle-pedestrian only bridge across the train tracks. Cross it, and continue straight ahead along the ramparts of the Kastellet citadel, dating back to 1624 and well preserved it's a lovely place to disembark your bikes and go for a stroll. When you reach the lower end of the hill, The Little Mermaid, is on your left, when the road ends under the restaurant, it turns into a cycle path that will take you the harbour front promenade, it's not common, but perfectly legal to cycle here, so zig-zag between the walking tourists at slow speed until you reach the big fountain, where you can make a short detour to see the Royal Palace. Continue along the harbour you'll pass the modern Royal Danish Playhouse and reach the famous Nyhavn, if the sun is out, join the locals for a beer at the bulwark. Cross the water on the short road bridge and turn left to cross the harbour on the brand new 30 million dollar bicycle bridge (opening May 2013). Continue straight over another short bicycle bridge and you'll reach Prinsessegade where you should end this tour, with a stroll at Christiania free town.
