From time immemorial Czechs, Germans, and Slovaks, as well as Italian stonemasons and stucco workers, French tradesmen and deserters from Napoleon’s army have all lived and worked here, all influencing one another. For centuries they jointly cultivated their land, creating works that still command our respect and admiration today. It is thanks to their inventiveness and skill that this small country is graced with hundreds of ancient castles, monasteries and stately mansions, and even entire towns that give the impression of being comprehensive artifacts. The Czech Republic contains a vast of amount of architectural treasure and has beautiful forests and mountains to match.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nThe Czech region was inhabited by Celtic tribe ",{"type":"''","value":["Boii"]}," for the first 4 centuries of the first millennium. The Celts gave way to post-Roman Germanic tribes. Later, Slavs arrived and, in the 9th century they founded the Great Moravian Empire, stretching from Germany to the Ukraine. After fall of Great Moravia the Bohemian Duchy (later Kingdom) was formed, creating a territorial unit almost identical to the modern Czechia. The rise of the Habsburgs led to Czechia becoming a part of the Austrian Empire, and later Austria-Hungary, and a massive influx of German immigrants.\n\nAfter the First World War, the closely related Czechs and Slovaks of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire merged to form the new nation of Czechoslovakia. During the interwar years, the new country's leaders were frequently preoccupied with meeting the demands of other ethnic minorities within the republic, most notably the Sudeten Germans and the Hungarians. A poor relationship with the German minority (20% of the overall population) was a particular problem that was capitalized on by Hitler and used as \"rationale\" for the dismemberment of the nation before the outbreak of WWII. The country was annexed and brutally occupied by Germany during the war.\n\nAfter World War II, Czechoslovakia expelled most of its Germans by force and many of the ethnic Hungarians under direction of the Potsdam Conference. However, the nation was very blessed in the fact that it emerged from the war more or less physically intact as it avoided the fate of the massive air bombardments and invasions that leveled most of the historic neighboring cities in Germany, Austria, Poland and Belarus. The country fell within the Soviet sphere of influence and remained so by force until 1989. \n\nIn 1968, an invasion by Warsaw Pact troops ended the efforts of the country's leaders to liberalize Communist party rule and create \"socialism with a human face\". Anti-Soviet demonstrations the following year ushered in a period of harsh repression and conservatism within the party ranks called \"normalisation\". In November 1989, the Communist government was deposed in a peaceful ",{"type":"''","value":["Velvet Revolution"]},".\n\nOn 1 January 1993, the country underwent a \"velvet divorce\" into its two national components, the Czech Republic and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Slovakia"]]},".

It is illegal to drive a motor vehicle under the influence of any amount of alcohol, and violations are heavily punished.\n\nIn order to drive on the well-kept motorways, however, you need to purchase a toll sticker. These stickers cost about CZK 310 (in 2013) for ten days (for vehicles lighter than 3.5 tonnes), but can be purchased for longer periods of time (1 month or a year). If you do not have a toll sticker on your car when you drive on the motorways, the fines can be very steep (CZK 5000 minimum).\n\nMake certain that you purchase the correct toll sticker: there are those for vehicles under 3.5 tonnes in weight and those for vehicles between 3.5 and 12 tonnes. Vehicles larger than 12 tonnes in weight must use an on-board unit (\"premid\" unit) to pay tolls based on distance.\n\nThe condition of many roads is continually improving, but to be economical and fast, drive on the motorways as much as possible, although if you want to get to remote parts of the country you will not avoid side-roads that may be a little bumpy sometimes.\n\nSpeed limits in the Czech Republic are usually 130 km\/h on motorways, 90 km\/h off the motorways, and 50 km\/h in towns. Petrol is inexpensive compared to the rest of Europe (CZK 37 \/ €1.40), but it is expensive compared to the United States, as it is heavily taxed.\n\nTraffic fines can usually be paid on the spot.\n\nThe use of headlights is mandatory at all times.

In each case, there are many advantages to purchases at the ticket office: The tickets are cheaper when bought in advance and the system automatically recommends the cheapest variant (sparing you the trouble of going through the -often byzantine- tariffs). Visiting the ticket office is only necessary when paying by cash or when needing some special kinds of fares (for example, sleeping car reservations) unavailable online. Ticket purchased online don't have to be printed: It is usually enough to show the pdf file to the conductor on a laptop or tablet screen. The main disadvantage when buying tickets on-line is the need to supply the traveller's name and the number of a government-issued photo ID, such as a driver's license or a passport.\n\nThe normal train ticket price on the ČD trains, always available even immediately prior to the departure, can be discouraging (roughly CZK 1.40 per km), but Czech Railways (ČD) offer plenty of discounts. Return ticket gives you a 5% discount, and a group of travellers (even two travellers are considered as a \"group\") is treated roughly as \"first person pays full price, others pay half price\".

Buying online and printing the ticket yourself gives you a small discount of 3% and you'll avoid the queue at the station.\n\nAlthough many train stations were repaired and modernized, the rest is still like a trip back in time to the communist era. There is no need to be afraid but try to avoid them in the late night hours.

Czech people are very proud of their language, and thus, even in Prague you will not find many signs written in English (outside of the main tourist areas). Many older people, especially outside the large cities, are also unable to converse in English, so it's good to learn some Czech or Slovak before your arrival. However, most young people speak at least some English, as it has been taught in most schools since 1990.\n\nMost Czechs speak a second and often a third language. English is the most widely known, especially among younger people. German is probably the most widely spoken second language among older people. Russian was compulsory in all schools under communist rule, so most people born before c. 1975 speak at least some Russian (and often pretty well). However the connection with the communist era and the Soviet led invasion in 1968 (as well as today's Russian-speaking criminal gangs) has given this language some negative connotations. It is also not very useful with younger people, as it is not, despite the common misconception, mutually intelligible with Czech (beyond some similar words and simple sentences), and has largely been supplanted by English as the foreign language of choice. Other languages, like French or Spanish, are also taught in some schools, but you should not count on it. People may also understand some basic words or simple sentences in other Slavic languages (Polish, Bulgarian, Serbo-Croatian, etc.).\n\nThe Czech and Slovak languages are very difficult for English-speakers to grasp, as they, like their sisters, can be tongue-twisting languages to learn (especially Czech) and take time and practice to master, especially if you're not really familiar with the other Slavic languages, including Russian. However, if you can learn the alphabet (and the corresponding letters with accents), then pronunciation is easy as it is always the same - Czechs and Slovaks pronounce every letter of a word, with the stress falling on the first syllable. The combination of consonants in some words may seem mind-bogglingly hard, but it is worth the effort!\n\nThe Czech language has many local dialects, especially in Moravia. Some dialects are so different that they can be sometimes misunderstood even by a native Czech speaker from a different region. However all Czech people understand the standard Czech (as spoken in TV, written in newspapers and taught in schools) and should be able to speak it (but some are too proud to stop using their local dialect). Some of them are even unable to speak standard Czech but write it correctly.\n\nThe vocabularies of Czech and Slovak are similar, with occasional words not understood.

It is heavy and quite fatty, and is excellent in the winter. In the recent time there was a tendency towards more light food with more vegetables, now the traditional heavy and fatty Czech food is usually not eaten everyday and some people avoid it entirely. However nothing goes as well with the excellent Czech beer as some of the best examples of the traditional Czech cuisine, like pork, duck, or goose with knedlíky (dumplings) and sauerkraut.\n\nA traditional main meal of a day (usually lunch) consists of two or three dishes. The first dish is hot soup (polévka). The second dish is the most important part, very often based on some meat and side-dish (both served on the same plate). The third, optional part is either something sweet (and coffee) or small vegetable salad or something similar.\n\nCzech cuisine knows many different kinds of ",{"type":"'''","value":["soup (polévka)"]},".

Important part of most main courses is side-dish (the whole dish including the side-dish is served on one plate) - usually cooked or baked potatoes, fries, rice, pasta or the most typical side-dish of the Czech cuisine - ",{"type":"'''","value":["knedlíky"]},".\n\nKnedlíky  (usually translated as ",{"type":"''","value":["dumplings"]},") come in many different kinds. Most kinds are used as side-dish, however some kinds with filling are used as dish by itself. The most common type, always used as side-dish, are ",{"type":"'''","value":["houskové knedlíky"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["bread dumplings"]},"). These are cooked in a shape of a cylinder, which is then cut into round slices about 8 cm in diameter remotely resembling white bread.

The latter combines very well with the world-famous Czech beer, the major brands being Pilsner Urquell, Gambrinus, Budvar, Staropramen, Velkopopovický Kozel and Krušovice. If you are lucky enough to enter a pub serving Svijany, you should definitely order it, as it is believed to be one of the most delicious brands worldwide.\n\nAnother common kind is ",{"type":"'''","value":["bramborové knedlíky"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["potato dumplings"]},"), the slices are smaller, more yellow in color, and are also always served as a side-dish. A typical combination is roasted meet (pork or lamb for example) with spinach and bramborové knedlíky or duck with sauerkraut and bramborové knedlíky (or combination of bramborové and houskové knedlíky). Less common are ",{"type":"'''","value":["chlupaté knedlíky"]}," (",{"type":"'''","value":["hairy dumplings"]},", but there are no hairs, don't panic), which are not sliced but cooked in shape of balls.

These are almost always served either with dumplings and red and white cabbage, or as guláš. \n\nDon't expect a wide selection of ",{"type":"'''","value":["zelenina"]},", vegetables, unless in the countryside - peppers, tomatoes and cabbage are the most commonly-seen side dishes, often served as a small garnish.\n\nVisitors may be surprised when they find \"American potatoes\" in the menu. These are actually potato wedges, usually spiced.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Meals You Usually Do Not Get in a Restaurant"]},"\n\nGenerally, probably the best place to really try the Czech cuisine is to be invited for such a meal to somebody's home. However, it is not so easy, because people today tend to prepare simpler and more international foods. Traditional Czech cuisine is often reserved to Sundays or some holidays or prepared by old grandma when her children visit her. This is not a rule, but it is a common situation. In common restaurants, even the better ones, the traditional Czech food usually does not match what the old grandma serves. This does not mean that the food is bad or not tasty, but it is missing something that the home preparation can provide. In luxurious restaurants specialized in Czech cuisine, the food can be excellent, but the luxurious style and creative improvements by the chef often do not match the style of the traditional folk cuisine. Again, this is not a hard rule. Sometimes you can compliment the food in a restaurant \"As if my grandma prepared it.\"\n\nThere are some dishes that are usually not served in any restaurants or pubs, are usually made at home and are worth trying if you have the opportunity.  ",{"type":"'''","value":["Brambory na loupačku"]}," (\"potatoes to be peeled\") is a cheap and simple meal usually made in the countryside. Whole unpeeled potatoes are cooked in a big pot and put in the pot itself or a bowl on the table. You just take a hot potato from the pot, peel it yourself, put some salt, butter, and\/or curd (tvaroh) on it and eat it. Drink it down with lot of cold milk. For such a simply meal it can be incredibly tasty, especially when eaten in the countryside after a day spent outside and chatting over it.\n\nPicking mushrooms in forests is a very popular activity in the Czech Republic. Probably not surprisingly, collected mushrooms are eaten then. In restaurants, usually only cultivated mushrooms are used. If forest mushrooms are served in a restaurant, then usually only as a minor addition to a meal. Homemade mushroom meals are a completely different story. A classic example is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Smaženice"]}," (the name is based on the verb 'smažit' - to fry), also known as míchanice (to mix) - forest mushrooms, the more kinds the better, are sliced to small pieces, mixed and stewed (with some fat, onion, and caraway). Later, eggs are added to the mixture. Smaženice is served with bread. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Smažené bedly"]}," are whole caps of parasol mushrooms coated in breadcrumbs and fried. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Černý kuba"]}," (literally ",{"type":"''","value":["black jimmy"]},") is  a traditional Christmas fasting meal made from dried mushrooms and peeled barley. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Houbová omáčka"]}," (mushroom sauce), served with meat and bread dumplings is also popular. Fresh or dried mushrooms make also a nice addition to ",{"type":"'''","value":["bramboračka s houbami"]}," (potato soup with mushrooms). ",{"type":"'''","value":["Kulajda"]}," is a soup from mushrooms and cream. Soups and sauces are the most likely forest mushroom meals to find in a restaurant, because they contain relatively small amount of mushrooms.\n\nIf you want to pick mushrooms by yourself, be careful. There are hundreds of species, some of them very tasty, some merely edible, but some poisonous or even deadly. There is also a species used as a hallucinogenic drug. A tasty and edible species may look very similar to a deadly species. If you do not know mushrooms very well, you should be accompanied by an experienced mushroom-picker.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Beer Snacks "]},"\n\nAlso try traditional beer snacks, often the only food served in some pubs (hospoda, pivnice), and designed to be washed down by a good beer:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Utopenec"]}," - (means 'drowned man' in Czech) a pickled sausage with onion, garlic and other vegetables and spices."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Zavináč"]}," - (rollmop) a slice of pickled fish, most often herring or mackerel, rolled-up and filled with various pickled vegetables (sauerkraut, onion, sometimes carrot or pepper).

Czechs are the heaviest beer drinkers in the world, drinking about 160 litres of it per capita per year. Going to a cosy Czech pub for dinner and a few beers is a must! \n\nThe best-known export brands are ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[[":Wikipedia:Pilsner Urquell"],["Pilsner Urquell"]]}]}," (Plzeňský Prazdroj), ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[[":Wikipedia:Budweiser Budvar"],["Budweiser Budvar"]]}]}," (Budějovický Budvar) and ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[[":Wikipedia:Staropramen"],["Staropramen"]]}]}," (freely translatable as \"Oldspring\").

And remember, real Czech beer is only served on tap – bottled beer is a completely different experience. High-quality beer can almost certainly be found in a ",{"type":"''","value":["hospoda"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["hostinec"]},", very basic pubs which serve only beer and light snacks. Take a seat and order your drinks when the waiter comes to you - going to the bar to order your drinks is a British custom! But beware, the handling of the beer is even more important than its brand. A bad bartender can completely ruin even excellent beer. Best bet is to ask local beer connoiseurs about a good pub or just join them.\n\nBeers are sometimes listed by their original sugar content, which is measured in degrees Plato (P\/°). The difference is generally apparent in the final alcohol content. Normal beer is about 10° (such as Gambrinus and Staropramen, which results in 4% ABV), lager 12° (such as Pilsner Urquell, which results in about 4.75% ABV). The latter is stronger and more expensive, so you should specify which one you want when you order.\n\nCzech lager is nothing like the fizzy lagers found in many other countries.  Instead, it has a very strong, hoppy, almost bitter flavour, and goes very well with heavy dishes like duck or pork and dumplings or strong cheeses. It always has a thick head on the top when it is served, but do not be afraid to drink \"through\" it, it is fun and it slowly disappears anyway, nevertheless do not drink the beer too slowly as the fresh cold taste (especially in hot summers) quickly fades – the \"true\" Czech connoisseurs do not even finish this \"tepid goat,\" as they call it.\n\nThe right beer bought in shops is only in half-litre brown glass bottles with sheet-crown cap. Experienced earthy beer drinkers drink it directly from the bottle. Some breweries distribute also big (two-litre or 1.5 litre) plastic bottles but they are considered a bit barbarian and degraded by Czechs, and the better breweries ridicule such form.

Don't pull out your tickets unless you are specifically asked to do so. And keep your wallet and money securely locked and separate from each other at all time.

Ticks hide in grass and bushes, so try to stay on trails and inspect exposed areas of skin after a hike. Vaccination against Encephalitis is available and recommended.

",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Ixodes.ricinus.searching.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Tick"]]},"\n\nTicks like to cling to any soft, warm, well-perfused areas of your body (undersides of knees and elbows, skin around ankles, groins, neck area, behind your ears etc.) and if not removed, they'll suck your blood until they grow about 1 cm big. Never try to scratch a tick off or pull it out, because damaging it can cause you a serious infection. The sooner the tick is removed, the smaller the chance of infection. Either ask a physician to remove a tick for you, or try to remove it by yourself: lubricate your finger with any greasy lotion and gently wag a tick from side to side until it wobbles free. Then flush it down the drain - never crush or burn it to avoid infection. Watch the affected spot: if you see a growing red spot developing there anytime during next several months, immediately visit your physician and tell him about that - you might have contracted Borreliosis. It is dangerous, but it can be easily treated with antibiotics during early stage. Be wary that American vaccination against Borreliosis most probably won't work against European strains (",{"type":"''","value":["B. afzelii"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["B. garini"]},").

Often in Western Europe and North America it is incorrectly referred to as an \"Eastern-European\" country, and most Czechs are very sensitive about this- many will even pre-empt the ignorance of some foreigners by asking \"What part of Europe would you say the Czech Republic is in?\" Get on their good side by answering \"Central Europe\", not Eastern!\n\nCzechs don't appreciate when foreigners incorrectly assume that their country was part of the Soviet Union or the Russian Empire – both definitely false – although it was part of the Soviet Bloc and, until 1918, an Austro-Hungarian territory. Commenting about how \"everything is quite cheap here\" comes across as condescending about the country's economic status.  \n\nIf you are knowledgeable about the Czechoslovakian communist regime following the second world war, bear in mind that this is still a sensitive issue for many and that it is easy to upset people in discussions on the subject.\n\nCzechs are one of the most atheist people in the world. This is true especially in large Bohemian cities. Don't assume that anyone you do not know believes in God or has a passion for Christianity. Respect that and your religion will also be respected.\n\nAlways say hello (",{"type":"''","value":["Dobrý den"]},") and goodbye (",{"type":"''","value":["Na shledanou"]},") when you enter and leave a small shop, as it is polite.\n\nWhile dining at a restaurant with a host's family it is customary for ",{"type":"''","value":["them"]}," to pick up the bill, the opposite of most Western standards. Don't assume they will - but also don't be surprised if they do.\n\nWhen entering a Czech household, always remove your shoes. Czechs usually wear slippers or sandals when inside a house and never their outdoor shoes. Depending on how traditional the host family are, they may insist you change immediately into house shoes as a hygiene precaution, though this is rare. At the very least they will offer you some to keep your feet warm.\n\nMentioning Czech towns and places with their former German names, when asking for directions (e.g. referring to Budweis instead of České Budějovice) may cause confusion and may be regarded as offensive and disrespectful towards the Czech people.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Moravia"]},"\n\nThe vast majority of Moravians will take no offence to being called Czechs, and consider themselves to be both.
