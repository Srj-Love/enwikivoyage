Just over one hour's drive from Córdoba, Granada and Málaga cities lies the village of Iznájar, the most southerly village of the Sierra Subbética mountain range, last known home to the Iberian Lynx.\n\nIznájar is an extremely popular tourist village due to it being on the edge of the Embalse de Iznájar - a 999,000 hectolitre manmade lake that permits fishing and water sports including sailing and kayaking throughout the year.\n\nThe village is worth visiting all year round, although has special Fiestas including Semana Santa (Easter Holy Week) and around 7th-9th of September there are huge processions in honour of the Virgin of Piety.  More than 250,000 people come to witness this incredibly moving event.\n\nThere are many places to stay from Luxury B&Bs to Self Catering Holiday Houses to Hotels, Hostels and Pensions.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nPainting\nPhotography\nYoga\nPilates\nQuad Biking\nKayaking\nSailing\nMountain Biking\nHiking\nHot Air Ballooning\nPaint Balling\nCanyon Descents\nWalking\n",{"type":"==","value":["Bouldering"]},"\nAt the West End of the Train station in the Avenida de America is a wall with some little rocks glued to it.t It's not a lot but a nice change.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Andalusia"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Córdoba (province)"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Europe\/Spain\/Autonomous_Communities\/Andalucia\/Cordoba\/"]]}]
