The calles (also streets) cross the Avenidas (also Avenues) and run from East to West. Calles are abbreviated as C, Cll and Cl.\n\nAvenidas, abbreviated as Av, are usually larger and main streets. The numerical system for the Avenidas is used but some have names that are more commonly used such as Avenida Libertadores or Avenida de Los Faroles. Each address consists of a series of numbers, for example: Av. 4 #12-24. This indicates that the building on Av. 4 is 24 meters from the corner. The city's avenues are numbered both east to west and west to east, starting from a central avenue numbered 0 (Avenida Cero). Like in the example, the letter E is added to avenues numbered west to east, as to denote East (Este).\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nThere are many public and private transportation companies that offer bus services and cover almost all of the metropolitan area (Villa del Rosario, Los Patios and El Zulia). It's a cheap way (ticket costs around US$ 0.45, but it will cost more depending on the bus, the route and the day) to travel around Cúcuta. Buses may be overcrowded, lack air conditioning and could be traveling very fast to try to outdo the one(s) from the competing lines that covers the same route. Beware.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\n\nThis is by far the best way to travel around if you don't mind spending a bit more for transportation. The cabs here may take you to anywhere you want, but they could be old Fords or Chevys from the 50's in very different stages of disrepair.\n\nAs of August 2010 the state of taxi service is much better than 50's vintage fords and Chevy's.  Expect to find a fleet of small but newer vehicles that are typically not more than 3–5 years old.  Driving in Cucuta can be a challenge, it's gotten much more crowded in the last three years and it is certainly exciting to watch the personal vehicles, taxi and lots of motorcycles vie for the limited road space.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Bicycle"]},"\n\nA ride on Cúcuta's modern Ciclo-Vía is a very exiting and healthy way to get to know the city and get closer to the people. There are certain rules that must be followed: Helmet must be worn when riding, also a reflective vest must be worn. The bicycle must have reflective panels in the wheels and back.\n\nThe Av.
