These offer an express service to the surrounding towns, the coastal villages, Tekirdağ, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Edirne"]]},", and even Istanbul, for not much more than the bus. The downside is that the times tend not to be fixed—the taxi leaves when it is full.\n\nThe buses go to the main ",{"type":"''","value":["otogar"]}," in Istanbul, although you can specify a through ticket, which will mean (for a small surcharge) you can be dropped on the Asian side, usually in Uskudar or Kadikoy. Small service buses also offer free transfers to main routes from either the bus station or the bus company's office. In terms of time, it takes around 2 hours to the main Istanbul bus station when it is busy, another half hour to either cross Istanbul to the Asian side or to get to Ataturk airport, and perhaps another hour to transfer from there to the new airport, Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen International Airport (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["SAW"]]},") ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.sabihagokcen.aero\/home_page"]},", on the Asian side.\n\nÇorlu's tiny bus station\/",{"type":"''","value":["otogar"]}," (especially when considering the size of the city it serves) lies at the western edge of the city centre, with very frequent (more than once every minute during daytime) minibuses to downtown departing from or calling at the bus stop on the street next to it. A leisurely stroll takes only about 20 minutes to central square from ",{"type":"''","value":["otogar"]},", though, so that's an option too if you don't have a heavy backpack.\n\nSince the city terminal cannot handle all the bus traffic most buses stop at ",{"type":"''","value":["Orion"]}," Mall crossroad.

Corresponding trains from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Edirne"]]}," in the west to Istanbul also call at the station.\n\nA twice-daily service from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tekirdağ"]]}," started recently as well. While the train ride itself is a bargain (2 TL pp—less than half of what you'd pay to minibus), with the stations at both ends of the line being quite away from respective city centres means that it's not as convenient as intertown minibuses, and when the fares for connecting minibuses to\/from the city centres added, it's not particularly cheap, either.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nThere is also an international ",{"type":"'''","value":["airport"]}," nearby (about 15 km  east of city centre, ",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["TEQ"]]},").

Since 2011, there are also buses on the same routes—run by the Çorlu Municipality (Turkish: ",{"type":"''","value":["Çorlu Belediyesi"]},", which you will see on buses). The fare on the municipality buses are cheaper than minibuses (around 0.90 TL) provided that you have a magnetic bus card. Cash payment option is also possible on the bus, however a bit more expensive (~1.50 TL).

However, like the rest of Turkey, motorists do not yield or respect motorcyclists, let alone cyclists.
