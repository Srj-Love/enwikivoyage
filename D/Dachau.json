Dachau first ran to prominence during the Middle Ages, when Duke William IV of Bavaria commissioned the palace of Dachau in 1546-1577. From that time on until the end of the monarchy in Bavaria in 1918 the town had always been a retreat for Bavarian kings, dukes and nobility, which is no wonder as the palace and the surrounding gardens offer a staggering view of the Alps and Munich, weather permitting. Towards the end of the 19th century Dachau became a town famous for its impressionist painters like Carl Spitzweg. \n\nHowever, with the advent of the Nazi regime, the city's history took a turn for the worst. Dachau was chosen to be the site of the very first Nazi concentration camp in 1933. In the camp mostly political dissidents, non-conformist intellectuals and priests were imprisoned. Although Dachau was mainly used as staging ground to ship prisoners to eastern death camps in Poland, approximately 42,000 people were murdered between 1933 and 1945 in the Dachau camp itself or its 169 sub-camps. After World War II the camp was first used to house displaced persons and then converted into a memorial site, which opened in 1965, to remind visitors of the darkest time in German history. Today Dachau has a big cultural scene as well as a still impressive picture-perfect old town and palace, because it completely escaped Allied bombing during World War II.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Tourist Information Dachau"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address=Konrad-Adenauer-Straße 3"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+49 8131 75286"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nDachau is conveniently located at several autobahns.\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["A 8"]},": Stuttgart - ",{"type":"''","value":["Dachau"]}," - Munich (exit ",{"type":"''","value":["78 Dachau\/Fürstenfeldbruck"]},")"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["A 92"]},": Deggendorf - ",{"type":"''","value":["Dachau"]}," - Munich (exit ",{"type":"''","value":["2 Oberschleißheim"]},")"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["A 99"]},": circular autobahn around Munich (exit ",{"type":"''","value":["10 München-Ludwigsfeld"]},")"]},"Furthermore, with ",{"type":"'''","value":["B 304"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["B471"]}," two major federal highways run through the city.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\nRegional trains from Munich Central Station run three times an hour and take 25 min to reach Dachau.
