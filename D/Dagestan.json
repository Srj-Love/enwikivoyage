For all this cultural diversity, Dagestanis are fairly united in their Islamic religion — virtually all non-Russian ethnic groups are Muslim. This is probably true since almost 32,000 people have left in a mass exit from Dagestan since the fall of the Soviet Empire in 1991.

But the conflict here between the indigenous Muslim people of the Caucasus has raged for some two hundred years, with a rare period of peace under the unifying political and ideological influence of the Soviet government, and the region today is perhaps more dangerous than it ever has been, with foreign extremist groups appearing in the mountain regions. All this amidst a brutal and more general response by the Russian military, determined to assert sovereignty over this perennially rebellious and lawless region.

A few, newer Chinese and Japanese restaurants have opened, but the food lacks authenticity and flavour. Western foods are likewise a scarcity, and there are no Western food chains anywhere in Dagestan.

Like other former Soviet Union countires, customer service is largely lacking, and Dagestani culture adds to the experience the guarantee of waiting a very, very long time for your order.\n\nIn general unless you like traditional Dagestani dishes, which are delicious, you are unlikely to be impressed by the food in Dagestan.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Кураг.jpg"],["thumb"],["280px"],["Kurag mountain aul"]]},"\n\nThe occasional Sharia booster may try his hardest, but this is Russia, and the drinking culture is as always indomitable—you'll have no problem getting a drink, be it in a house in a mountain aul or a cafe\/bar in Derbent.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nThe best developed facilities (still pretty basic) are in Makhachkala and Derbent, but you should be able to find guesthouse style lodging with little difficulty in any town or village.
