It is much quieter than either Cairns or PD, owing to the distance, crossing the Daintree river (a ferry may take cars and buses across, for a toll), conservation efforts and being off the power grid. The Daintree region is currently in flux regarding conflicting demands of population and economy growth and preservation of the spectacular natural environment. \n\nThe quiet environment makes for a very pleasant, laidback tropical stay, somewhat distanced from the mass tourism of Cairns and Port Douglas although Cape Tribulation is a popular daytrip for visitors and amenities for tourists abound.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and Fauna"]},"\nThe park consists largely of broadleaf lowland tropical rainforests and upland tropical rainforests, although there are also significant mangrove and fan palm communities. The rainforest is an amazing array of biodiversity. Look out for the cassowary, a large non-flying bird with a \"helmet\" growth on its head to protect it as it runs through the forest. Of course, as with all of far northern Australia, saltwater crocodiles are present.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nTropical climate with moderate seasonal variations.

The ride from Cow Bay to Cape Tribulation is about 25km each way and a nice daytrip, although a bit hilly in the Noah Range area.\n\nThe road is sealed all the way to Cape Tribualtion and all rental companies allow cars to travel as far as the Cape. 4WDs are required only for the Bloomfield Track.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nInteractive Rainforest Guided Walks with Aboriginal Guide ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.daintree-ecolodge.com.au\/Experiences\/Daintree-Eco-Lodge-and-Spa-Aboriginal-walk.html"]},"\n\nMason's Tours ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/masonstours.com.au"]},"is the original tour operator at Cape Tribulation and offers 1\/2 Day Walks, 2 Hour Walks, Nightwalks and 4WD Tours.
