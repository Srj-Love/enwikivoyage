At present there are two passenger terminals — one for international flights and one for domestic — which handle a total of 2.5 million passengers each year. The terminals are 200 meters apart and are connected by walkways. A new, much larger international terminal is built with the old one is employed by domestic flights now. This will presumably reduce the often-lengthy time presently spent waiting in queues.\n\nBeware the captive-market food and drink pricing: 4 euro for a Coke, 3 euro for a small bottle of water, 12 euro for a Big Mac meal (more expensive even than ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Haifa"]]},"), 4 euro for a packet of crisps.\n\nDalaman Airport is one of the busiest airports in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lycia"],["Western Mediterranean"]]},"\/",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southern Aegean"]]}," regions of Turkey.

Plans and materials for both buildings were shipped from France at the same time, but there was a mistake—plans and materials for each building were loaded into the wrong ship, and thus train station ended up in Dalaman, while hunting manor made its way to Alexandria. It was decided to let the buildings have built in the opposite location they were intended at first, as it was found out that shipping the materials once again would be too costly. Even a short stretch of rail track, hundreds of kilometres away from the nearest part of rail network, was laid out in front of the building. Today, the elegant building, covered with overgrown ivies all over, serves as the headquarters of surrounding large state farm. Its nicely landscaped large yard, with huge lawns and pretty stately palm trees, is also worth a check."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox-1"],["image1=TR-400.png"],["imagesize1=22"],["directionl1=W"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Marmaris"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Akyaka"]]}],["directionr1=E"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Antalya"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Göcek"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Dalaman"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["36.7667"],["28.8000"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Lycia"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Middle_East\/Turkey\/Provinces\/Mugla\/Districts\/Dalaman\/"]]}]
