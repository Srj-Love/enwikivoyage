Temperatures are pleasantly warm by day, and cool at night, down to perhaps 10 degrees Celsius.\n\nDalat is surrounded by some of the best mountain biking, hiking and canyoning opportunities in Vietnam, with hills of coffee and tea plantations, which evoke images of the colonial hill stations of the north of India.\n\nDalat's high altitude (1,500–2,000 m) and fertile landscape make it one of Vietnam's premier agricultural areas, producing varieties of fruits, vegetables, tea, coffee, and flowers that don't grow in the lowlands. In markets as far north as Hanoi and Haiphong, vegetable and flower vendors will tout their \"grown in Dalat\" produce.\n\nDalat is a favorite destination for company-sponsored weekend outings, family getaways, and honeymooners.\n \n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Little Eiffel Tower Da Lat Vietnam.JPG"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Flower Eiffel Tower"]]},"\n\nMost local and foreign travellers arrive in Dalat by bus, including those travelling on the famous Sinh Cafe Hanoi-HCMC open-tour buses.
