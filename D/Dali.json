It is a medium-sized city of 650,000 but its tourist draw is the \"Old Town.\" Like many Chinese tourist destinations, the old town, which has architecture that dates back to the Ming dynasty, has been extensively renovated, rebuilt and modernized, including newly constructed city walls and gates. You can still see the remnants of the old wall in the form of long mounds that surround the old city, but Dali is no longer a walled city by any means. The old town section of Dali is sandwiched between two multi-lane highways. While it lacks the authentic rustic charm of other old Chinese cities (e.g. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pingyao"]]}," or even ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lijiang"]]},")  and much of the old town has been renovated and is devoted to tacky knick-knack stores for Chinese tourists, it does sit in the shadow of a beautiful mountain range, the Cangshan and is close to the large Erhai lake. There is an expensive cable car (90 Yuan) that you can take to reach the top and there are some hiking paths that offer beautiful views of Lake Erhai.\n\nBut do not expect to find a small ancient city in the beautiful mountains of Yunnan. This is not what you will get. Dali is very spread-out and it takes almost an hour by bus #8 to get form the train station in the modern part of town to the old town. The rest of Dali is filled with modern buildings, 20 story residential towers, even a Wal Mart. You can also see factories belching emissions on the other side of Lake Erhai.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" History"]},"\nIn 738 the Nanzhao Kingdom was established; the original capital of the Nanzhao Kingdom was located in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Weishan"]]}," (within Dali Prefecture) and later moved to sites around Erhai Lake. The territory conquered was quite substantial; covered a large area of Yunnan and northern ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Burma"]]},", and parts of what are now ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sichuan"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guizhou"]]},". The kingdom survived almost 200 years and had 13 kings before collapsing. After several decades of chaos the Kingdom of Dali emerged in 937.\n\nThe Kingdom of Dali established by Duan Siping in 937 was controlled by the Duan clan and survived until conquered by the Mongols about 300 years later. The Kingdom retained a close alliance with the Tang Dynasty, and was one of the major transit points for the introduction of Buddhism throughout the rest of China. By 1000, Dali was one of the 13 largest cities in the world.\n\nThe rulers of the original Nanzhao Kingdom were probably precursors to the modern Yi peoples, while the Kingdom of Dali rulers were precursors to the modern Bai minority.\n\nMany local people in Dali have the surname Duan to this day (rare in other parts of China). These historical events are immortalised in the Martial Arts literature of Hong Kong author Jin Yong (read by every Chinese school kid), giving Dali a fame nationwide. Both the Nanzhao Kingdom and the Kingdom of Dali had a military alliance with the Tang Dynasty against the aggressive Turfan (Tibetan) Empire which made regular and aggressive incursions into their respective territories.\n\nA huge memorial stele to the ",{"type":"''","value":["Pacification"]}," of Kingdom of Dali was built during the Ming Dynasty and remains standing at the end of Sanyue Street past the city's West Gate. Entrance is free. The Mongols destroyed the old capital and palace of the Kingdom of Dali, located just to the south of the Three Pagodas. Almost all records of both the Nanzhao and Dali Kingdoms were burnt or destroyed, leaving much unknown about these periods.  In addition, the Mongols brutally displaced many of the inhabitants of the prefecture, with the result that Bai minority people were forced as far east as Hunan Province. Many ethnic Han also moved into the Kunming area during this period.\n\nThe old Dali City was rebuilt in the early 1400s by the Ming Dynasty. What you see in Dali Old Town today is the rebuilt Ming town. Since then, the fortunes of Dali have declined and its importance as a cultural and economic centre in the Yunnan area have been overtaken by Kunming, the provincial capital.\n\n1856-1872 Dali was the headquarters of the Panthay Rebellion led by Du Wenxiu. That rebellion commenced as an uprising against local oppressive rulers by the Hui Muslim minority and ended as open rebellion against the Qing Dynasty. The Palace of Du Wenxiu is on Fuxing Road and serves as the local museum (the museum exhibition on the rebellion paints it as a patriot workers revolt which it was not). The rebellion was brutally crushed by the Qing and hundreds of thousands of Yunnan Muslims were killed in revenge.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nBuses from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kunming"]]}," West Bus Station take about 4,5 hours and cost 100 yuan for an ordinary bus and around 130 yuan for an express luxury bus, and will bring you to Xiaguan (Dali New City). Some buses go to Dali, too, so check with the driver. In Xiaguan, there are three different bus stations, to reach the train station, go east along Jianshe Lu and Dianyuan Lu. From Xiaguan Train Station (in Dali New Town) you can take bus 8 and bus 4 (1.5 yuan, 45 minutes approx. 18 km) to Dali Old Town 13 km to the north (Bus 4 also runs through the town). It's also possible to catch a white mini-bus on Jianshe Lu that run between Xiaguan and Dali, there's usually a white sign displayed inside the front wind shield that reads (大理<->下关) in Chinese. The cost for the mini-bus is 3 yuan per person. Taxi fare between Xiaguan and Dali should be around 40 yuan.\n\nIf the expressway is closed or under construction the bus may opt for the more scenic route akin to the notorious \"road of death\" in Bolivia, though paved.\n\nBuses coming south from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lijiang"]]}," are about 60-80 yuan and stop outside the old town, from where it is possible to get a taxi or walk to the main guesthouses. You can save about 20 yuan on the Lijiang bus by simply hailing one on the highway east of the old town.\n\nThere is a bus service to Xiaguan from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jinghong"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Xishuangbanna"]]}," prefecture, which has buses running at 17:00 and 21:30, possibly earlier too. The ticket price was 195 yuan and the journey was about 17 hours. The bus used on this route is a sleeper bus so you get a fairly comfortably bed and a blanket.

The cost is ¥105 for a night trains sleeper bunk, and ¥31 for day trains hard seat. Bus 8 to the old town leaves regularly for ¥1.5 from just outside the station, terminating at the West Gate.\nThere are currently also 2 trains daily from Lijiang to Dali and back. The ride takes nearly 2 hours. Cost is 30¥ for hard seat. The train actually only has hard sleeper cars, but you are not allowed to lay down.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nDali has an airport located to the east of Dali New City, about 45 minutes drive to Dali old town. There are no airport busses. Taxis are waiting but cannot always be trusted to take you to the guesthouse\/hotel you want to go to as they get commission at a lot of hotels. Better book an airport pick-up with the hotel you booked. Flights from\/to Kunming: only morning flights at the moment (Nov, 2009). Depending on the time of year you can get discounted tickets (around 400 yuan one way Dali-Kunming) but you will need to book well ahead. Full price is 750 yuan (680 + 70 airport tax, nov 2009). From major Chinese cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou) it is possible to book a flight to Dali but always with a stopover in Kunming. Best discounts apply to tickets booked 15 days+ in advance.\n\nAlternatively, you can go to Kunming Wujiaba International Airport by plane. It is located in the southeast of Kunming, the capital city of Yunnan Province. (It is one of the most important and the busiest international airports of China.) You can then take the Airport Shuttle bus ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.airport-china.com\/kunming-wujiaba-airport\/traffic\/airport-shuttle.html"]}," from Kunming airport. They operate 6:30-22:00 (Beijing time).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nDali Old Town is small enough to get around on foot, and being laid out in a grid format it is relatively easy to navigate.  The major landmarks are the South and North Gates with Fuxing Road running between them, and Yangren Street (Westerner's Street) lined with cafés and tourist shops. City maps are readily available for around ¥5 but tend not to follow the usual ",{"type":"''","value":["north-at-the-top"]}," standard because the natural orientation of someone in Dali is to look towards the huge looming Cangs Mountain which runs north-south next to the city.  As you look at the mountains and face west, the lake is at your back, or east.  This method of orientation makes even more sense when you realize that the entire town gently slopes from the mountains to the lake, making those two landmarks a natural way to find your bearings.\n\nBikes are also available at many guesthouses and rental huts around town and cost ¥5-40 per day. Bikes vary greatly in quality so shop around for the best deal. The Chinese brands Merida and Giant are among the better ones to consider.  \n\nTaxis in Dali Old Town generally cost ¥5 for under 3 km (though most drivers will ask for ¥10). For other locations outside the old town, all prices are negotiable. A taxi to Dali New City will cost around ¥40.\n\nIn addition to the Old Town, Dali is a Prefecture of over 10,000 km",{"type":"<","value":["sup",["2"]]},". A whole range of destinations exist within the Prefecture that are perfect for the adventurous traveller. All are relatively easily accessible from either Dali Old Town or Dali New City, the major city 13 km to the south.

Watch your belongings carefully to protect from pickpockets and theft, though perhaps the major risk you take if staying in cheap accommodation is theft by other foreign travellers. Overall Dali is a very safe place with little crime directed at tourists.\n\nIf you are planning to hike up the Cang mountains, travel in a group both to protect yourself from robbery and as back up in case of accident. Stay on the paths and don't take any risks climbing no matter how experienced you are, as fatal accidents do happen!\n\nDrugs disguised as strange artifacts are usually sold by women in traditional Bai costume, who will then lead you to their homes. Marijuana was widespread in Dali's foreign bars before 2009, when police crackdowns and arrests forced the smokers back into the alleys and guesthouses. It is still widespread, of course, but it is no longer tolerated in public.  It is not uncommon to see marijuana growing in the wild. Women may also offer you \"opium,\" though it is just worthless garbage, possibly sesame oil pressed with some unknown substance. The summer of 2012 all the old ladies  and other dealers have disappeared or do not sell any weed anymore,   Things are very dry for marijuana.  I am sure in the fall once the plants have grown again you can find some plants.  There are only a few people selling anything on the sidewalks now and you will never see any one selling pipes.  Dali is losing much of it color now\n\nDon't get your shoes fixed by men approaching you on the corner of Fu Xing Rd and Foreigner St. Even if a price is agreed, they will add a couple of extra stitches and charge ridiculously inflated prices (¥200-300). You're in a difficult position to argue because they have your shoes! Just go to a regular established shoe shop (there are several towards the East end of Renmin Rd) where you can get your shoes repaired well for less than ¥10.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nMost of the hostels and travel agents can organise bus tickets anywhere in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yunnan"]]},".  They can also arrange flights farther afield.\n\nMany travelers from Kunming continue on from Dali to Lijiang. Consider taking the smaller bus through the mountains toward Jianchuan (can be picked up at the main bus station in Xiaguan - \"New\" Dali City). Get off the bus at the fork in the road in the village of Diannan (about 8 km south of Jianchuan).

After your visit to Shaxi it is easy to continue your journey. A minibus from Shaxi or Shibaoshan can take you to the main bus station in Jianchuan. From there it is easy to get a bus on to Lijiang.\n\nThere is also a sleeper service to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shangrila"]]},", coming from Xiaguan, and passing Dali at 20:30h (¥120).
