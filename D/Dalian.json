Under Russian rule Dalian, or Dalny as it was known, became the southern tip of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Trans-Siberian Railway"]]}," and the main port of the eastern Russian empire. Following the Russian defeat in the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-5, the city was transferred to Japanese control and renamed Dairen. The Chinese government resumed control following the Second World War (though the city was jointly run with Russia until 1955) and in 1950 was again renamed by the newly formed Communist regime, this time to Luda City. There followed a period of relative stagnation until the city (once again named Dalian) was opened up to foreign investment in 1984. This sparked the first period of redevelopment of the city, the second period coming with the appointment of Bo Xilai as mayor. Under Bo's stewardship, the city became a model example of redevelopment, with extensive redevelopment of its infrastructure and open spaces and a new focus on tourism and commerce and away from heavy industry.\n\nDalian is less reliant on heavy industry than its Northeast counterparts, and what heavy industry there is mostly located in the development zone far outside the city center. This, combined with the city's many parks and green hills, wide thoroughfares and army of street cleaners, make Dalian a more pleasant city to visit and live in than most Chinese cities of comparable size. Though most of the tourist industry in the city is targeted at the domestic, rather than the international market, overseas tourists should still find enjoyment in the city. The large number of foreign businesses in the city and foreign students and teachers at the city's many universities ensure that there are plenty of companies (from upmarket hotels to bars and coffee houses) which cater to those who do not call China their native home. The city has a population of around 6,000,000. \nDalian's perhaps most abuzz when it hosts the World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting of the Champions (summer Davos).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mandarin phrasebook"],["Mandarin"]]}," is the main language of Dalian, and most Dalianese speak a fairly standard version of the dialect, though the local variety (known as Dalian-hua and related to the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shandong"]]}," dialect) can sometimes be hard to follow for those unfamiliar with it. As in the rest of China, English is increasingly spoken, but still not understood by most Dalianese.

Rates start at ¥8 (¥10.40 after 22:00) for the first 3 km and ¥2 for each additional kilometre. For idle time, tack on ¥0.3\/minute. Round all taxi fares to the nearest whole number as drivers do not accept any coinage less than ¥1 (e.g., ¥11.60 would round up to ¥12). Drivers range in mood, some acting quite gruff and excessively aggressive while some are keenly interested in where you originate from or other small talk. On the good side, they are less likely to take needlessly long routes compared to other tourist cities in China as Dalian is a relatively small city with a limited number of major highways\/thoroughfares. Drivers don't understand basic English, so be prepared ahead of time to ensure accurate drop-off. If a driver is looking to pick up additional passengers along your route, encourage him or her to keep on driving unless you're comfortable with what might ensue. Especially during rush hour, when taxis are heavily sought after, it's quite common for drivers to pick up additional passengers if heading in the same direction as those in the taxi.\n\nA thing to note on taxis is however, same as anywhere in China is that during bad weather (e.g.: heavy rain, snow, etc.), some drivers may decide to go off the meter (illegal but not enforced) or only accept far-away destinations. Plan your trip beforehand if there's bad weather.\n\nThe city does suffer from a large number of illegal taxis, both drivers and vehicles (even vehicles that are painted and have meters may be operating illegally). These drivers may be hesitant to go on routes which might be more heavily patrolled. The driver may use the meter, thus charging you an accurate fare, but they will often avoid giving a receipt. The best way to avoid running into any issues is to use taxis which have a ",{"type":"'''","value":["blue or white"]}," light on top of the car: this is the highest colour ratings afforded to a Dalian taxi driver. Conversely, yellow is the lowest rating while all other coloured-lights are somewhere in between.\n\nMany taxi drivers smoke and play their radios. Some may also hesitate to start the meter so be sure you let them know to start it if you think they've forgotten or up to their tricks. Few use the air conditioner in the summer, except for perhaps during the hottest parts of day. The nicest thing about the taxis and size of Dalian is that ¥20 can go a long ways in getting around.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Dalian transport map.png"],["thumb"],["right"],["250px"],["Public transport map"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["On foot"]},"\n\nBeing a fairly compact city, it's easy to break up taxi or bus rides with a short walk. In the morning, it's not uncommon for the streets to be slick due to the pollution and dust mixing with the dew, so take caution. Additionally, some surfaces consist of shiny tile which make for beautiful viewing but can be incredibly slippery when wet or during the winter when snow may be hiding the slick surface underneath. Lastly, the pavements may have pits or missing utility covers, along with low-hanging clothes lines draped in front of businesses or homes, so be on the lookout at night when it can be harder to see these hangups.  Controlled crosswalks and pedestrian tunnels (along with a few pedestrian bridges) make it easy to cross major intersections. It is advised to keep your head on a swivel when going to cross a street—autos typically do not yield even when the crosswalk signal is green for pedestrians.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.dalianbus.com Buses"]}]}," are the main form of public transport in Dalian and most services run very frequently. Roadside signs at the queues are available in Chinese and English (often translated, which is nice for knowing what some of the words mean but impractical when needing to reference a spot). The typical wait between buses is about five minutes. Seats are generally hard and, even with very frequent services, buses on major routes can still get crowded at peak times. Although fitted to do so, most operate with air conditioning or heating systems off, although in extreme heat or cold the driver may decide to turn them on. Services start early in the morning (anywhere from 04:30-08:00) and usually finish around 10PM, although some services finish earlier\/later depending on the popularity of the line. Fare is ¥1-2.\n\nBus routes that may be of use to visitors include #2 (from Qiniwa station to Tiger Beach), #4 (from Olympic Square to Tiger Beach), #5 (from Zhongshan Lu near Qingniwa to Jingsha beach via Fujiazhuang), #13 (from the west side of Victory Square to the ferry terminal), #16 (from Zhongshan Lu near Qingniwa to the Xinghai conference centre) and #22 (from the railway station to Xinghai Square). Ticket prices for all these routes, as with most buses in Dalian, are ¥1 regardless of distance and exact change must be given.\n\nIn addition to the regular public buses there are also three air-conditioned tourist buses. #801 runs a circular route from the railway station and takes in People's Square, Xinghai Square, Fujiazhaung Beach, Tiger Beach, Labour Park and Zhongshan Square along the way. The entire journey takes about an hour and costs ¥20, though earlier stops cost less (the minimum being ¥5). #801B runs from the ferry terminal to Heishijiao via Zhongshan Square, the railway station, People's Square and Xinghai Square while #K901 runs from the Foreign Languages University to the south-western edge of Dalian via Zhongshan Square, the Railway station, Xinghai Square and Heishijiao. Tickets for both buses are ¥2.\n\nOf particular interest to tourists is a bus to Binhai Lu for ¥10 (08:00-16:00). It starts from near the railway station and covers the Conference & Exhibition Centre, Dalian Seashell Museum, Forest Zoo, FuJiazhuang beach, Yan Woling, Birdsong Forest, Tiger Beach Paradise, Harbour Square and Zhongshan Square.

The occasional hilly street with a tram scooting along past colonial buildings combine to give Dalian a look unique in China. There are two main tram routes: #201 runs largely west-east from Xinggong Street near the Shahekou Railway Station to the Haizhiyun (Rhythm of the Sea) Park on the coast. #202 runs from the High Tech Zone (near Xiaoping Island) to the Jinhui shopping area where the #201 starts. The #203 line was merged into the #201 route. As a result, visitors should note the destination sign on the tram before boarding, as the express and other special trams will skip some stops.

Chinese yuan (or ",{"type":"''","value":["renminbi"]},") can be exchanged for at the airport, most 3-star and up hotels, and pretty much any bank. There may be restrictions to foreigners exchanging currency at some banks without the ID of a Chinese national, or limited amounts may only be permitted. Informal exchange personnel often spend time in the lobbies of large banks, with a black purse under arm, and typically offer a better exchange rate than the bank itself. Keep in mind these are not members working for the bank, and while there is a security guard(s) in all lobbies of banks, so if you ever feel you're not getting a square deal, you may begin to bargain with others or attempt to exchange directly with the bank itself. While Unionpay is accepted at several establishments, those hailing from outside of China won't find the brand too helpful. Major credit cards are accepted few places other than 4- and 5-star hotels.\n\nThere are many souvenir stalls around the main tourist sights in Dalian. The typical local souvenirs are Russian-themed items (remnants of a bygone era when ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]}," laid claim to Dalian and much of Northeast China) and dried seafood, neither of which are of particular interest to foreign travellers (the first would be a strange thing to bring back from China and the second would violate customs regulations). There are plenty of other shopping areas that would be of more interest. Some general Chinese souvenirs include jade sculptures, shadow boxes with shell mosaics, calligraphy scrolls, Peking Opera masks, etc. Day to day essentials are also available in these shopping areas. As with the rest of China, bargaining is pretty much mandatory outside of department stores and supermarkets (although you can also bargain on some department stores like the knock-off MyKals).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nThe local cuisine of Dalian is influenced by Dongbei regional style of cooking (which has a not wholly unjustified reputation for being big on portions and relatively low on flavour) and the city's proximity to the sea. Buns, pancakes and dumplings are staples rather than rice or noodles. The city also has a very good reputation for seafood dishes which are well worth trying. Overseas travellers  should be aware, however, that in China seafood has different connotations than elsewhere, literally seafood refers to anything edible from the sea. Fish dishes invariably contain plenty of small bones that must be navigated around or crunched through (the local method). Additionally, due to its relation and storied history with Korean and Japanese empires, Dalian has many restaurants serving this kind of fare.\n\nThe range and number of restaurants is huge, and the listings provided should be considered as merely scratching the surface of what is available. Individual exploration of the restaurants is recommended. Reservations are generally not necessary, so phone numbers have only been provided for those restaurants where tables may need reserving. Those wanting to stick to the familiar will find a large number of western and Japanese and Korean restaurants available, and international fast food chains are well represented.\n\nFor good eats, try the recommendations in ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Dalian\/Zhongshan"],["Zhongshan District"]]}]}," and  in ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Dalian\/Xigang"],["Xigang District"]]}]},".\n\nTravelers on a budget will be spoiled for choice in Dalian, with low cost restaurants on literally every street corner (particularly in the more residential areas outside of the main city center). It would be impossible to begin to list them all, so only a couple of options available near the center have been listed in the district articles. The quality of the restaurants can be highly variable. A good rule of thumb when searching for a decent place to eat is, if the decor looks shabby but the place is packed the food is almost always good. Ordering can be tricky for non-Chinese speakers as English menus are incredibly rare in cheaper restaurants, and English speaking staff are even more rare. Try the roadside snack stalls which offer pancakes, rolls, skewers of barbecued meat and candied fruits starting at ¥1. These may cause some upset stomachs or bouts of diarrhea, so be advised.\n\nAs with budget restaurants there are plenty of mid-range restaurants to choose from in Dalian (differentiated from budget restaurants usually by being larger and having better decor), so experimentation is the key. The restaurants listed in the various district articles are just a couple of particularly noteworthy examples. The same caveats as for budget restaurants apply as regards language, though quality is less variable.\n\nThe more expensive end of the restaurant market in Dalian is generally a seafood restaurant boasting fresh, usually local cuisine or the more authentic Japanese restaurants (as opposed to those which have been adapted for local taste preferences). English menus and English speaking staff are most common in the western-themed restaurants, but even mid-priced restaurants may have English or pictures available.\n\nThere are a number of restaurants which serve seafood. Typically those downtown or in Xinghai Square have the best seafood, notably ",{"type":"'''","value":["Wanbao"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Zihan Fan Dian"]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nDalian offers a wide variety of bars and nightclubs catering to a mixture of locals, foreign business people and the teaching crowd.  The city lacks a bona fide bar street such as Beijing's ",{"type":"''","value":["Sanlitun"]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai"]]},"'s ",{"type":"''","value":["Maoming Lu"]}," with bars fairly liberally scattered across the city centre as well as near large universities. There are three main clusters of bars that those wishing to bar hop could concentrate on, however, the first and most centralized along a side street off Wuwu Lu near Sanba Square, the second along Changjiang Lu north of the Shangri-la Hotel and the third along Gaoerji Lu south of People's Square. KTV, or karaoke, is a large part of Chinese culture. There are a variety of such, some catering more to family or group get togethers and some for business outings. Typically the former are based in larger buildings and have little shops inside where drinks and snacks can be purchased, while the latter tend have a row of standing waitresses or mistresses lined up at the front door or shortly upon entering the singing room.\n\nAnother good place to go for drinks for those on the cheap are the night markets that spring up during the summer. These offer very cheap draught beer (¥1-3  for a large glass) and barbecued meat, tofu, vegetables and bread in an informal outdoor setting; some may not even have chairs. This isn't recommended for those who are staying in Dalian a short time or those whom haven't spent a few weeks in China getting their immune system ready unless you're not worried about having any diarrhea issues. Many of the locals don't even eat at these types of places. Those looking for non-alcoholic drinks, there are plenty of coffee shops and tea houses around the city.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Chain coffee shops"]}," include Starbucks ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.starbucks.com.cn\/"]},", SPR ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.sprcoffee.com\/"]}," and Amici Coffee, all of which offer Wi-Fi (SPR and Amici a food menu as well).

Almost all hotels have at least a perfunctory business centre offering Internet access, although usually at a higher price than at an Internet café but most of the splurge hotels offer it for free. \n\nThere are a handful of ",{"type":"'''","value":["public phones"]},", as in standalone phones. These are few and far between, however, and to use them you need to purchase an IC card which can't be used for anything else. More practical, and cheap, are the phones that can be found at convenience stores or kiosks. To use these simply indicate you wish to use one, dial the number and then hand over the money, usually less than ¥1 for short local calls, to the shop assistant at the end. Not all such phones will allow you to dial outside of Dalian, however, and very few accept international calls, those that do will have the letters IDD on the telephone sign outside the shop\/kiosk.\n\nFor ",{"type":"'''","value":["international calls"]}," the best places to go are the phone bars (often labelled 电话吧 (",{"type":"''","value":["diànhuà ba"]},")), generally found around residential areas. To make a call simply walk in, choose a vacant phone and when finished indicate which phone you used to the cashier: typically the phones have a number written above them. Prices can be highly variable, but a reasonably long call shouldn't come to more than ¥50. A more expensive, and possibly more convenient, option is to ask to use the phone in hotel lobbies.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Calling cards"]}," (known as IP cards) are plentiful and, as in the rest of China, offer the cheapest way of calling overseas. Be aware, however, that not all brands of cards offer oral English instructions, so those not fluent in Mandarin would be best to use the two main brands of China Netcom and China Telecom.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Mobile phones"]},", and mobile phone stores, are plentiful in Dalian.

These branches, as with most larger post offices in the city, offer Western Union wiring facilities, though the branch next to the railway station is the only one which can receive funds.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nCrime, particularly street crime, is low in Dalian as it is in most of China. That said, the people in northeastern China are on average more aggressive than their southern counterparts and fights do happen. (Most often when alcohol is involved.) While foreigners are unlikely to be targeted, one would be wise to avoid any heated exchanges. Additionally pickpockets do operate, so care should be taken with valuables especially in busy shopping areas or on crowded buses or trains.\n\nProbably the greatest safety risk you'll face in Dalian is from the traffic which can be chaotic at the best of times. China has the highest rate of road fatalities in the world and allowances made for pedestrians are practically nonexistent. Marked crossings seem to serve little purpose other than as target ranges. Dalian's many wide avenues may be good for congestion but by creating more fast flowing traffic than in, say, Beijing they make life harder for pedestrians. The best way to cross the road other than over bridges, through tunnels or at traffic lights is to wait for a gap in the traffic and run. Don't under any circumstances expect cars to stop for you.\n\nHealth-wise Dalian's relatively low levels of pollution (when compared to other domestic cities) mean health problems from bad air are less of an issue than in other Chinese cities. The water, while technically drinkable, is made drinkable via the addition of hefty amounts of chemicals and pipes are seldom kept in the best condition so boiling is pretty much mandatory, and bottled water is usually a safer bet—locals either boil tap water or buy filtered water. Tap water should be fine for brushing teeth and washing with, however. The complete lack of any health inspection mechanism means food poisoning is a constant danger, but most restaurants should be OK. Even still, however, nice restaurants are known to sell outdated seafood from time to time. Avoid any restaurants that seem strangely quiet (customers tend not to return to places that leave them on the toilet for a week). It's always a good idea to pack a few diarrhea tablets before leaving, just in case. Hospitals are liberally scattered throughout the city with the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Friendship Hospital"]}," on Wuwu Lu (",{"type":"''","value":["+86 0411"]}," 8271 8822) and the first affiliated hospital of Dalian Medical University (Also known as \"Fuyi\" in Chinese) are the most likely to have English speaking staff. China's hyper-capitalist health-care system means that payment in cash is required before any treatment is dished out, so make sure to bring a few hundred yuan with you should you need medical attention.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n\nThough credit and debit cards are gradually becoming more widely accepted at department stores and supermarkets most stores and all attractions still operate on a cash-only basis and only the very largest or most expensive shops accept foreign credit cards. It's generally best to ensure that you have a decent amount of cash on hand when going out. ATMs are located at virtually all bank branches, and most (though not all) of the large banks now accept foreign debit or credit cards. Bank of China branches all have the ability to take cards from foreign banks, and most offer English instructions. For more advanced financial transactions (converting currency or travellers checks, for instance) the best places to go are the Bank of China branch on the north side of Zhongshan Square and the HSBC branch on Renmin Lu just east of the Shangri-la hotel.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Worship"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Dalian Christianity Cheng'en Church"],["alt=大连市基督教承恩堂"],["url="],["email="],["address=Changjiang Lu and Beijing Jie"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Can use the #201 trolley as the stop is at the intersection of the two streets.

Significant fines for both the foreigner and any accompanying national citizens can result if an official notices a non-Chinese visiting sites. (If you happen to be from North Korea or Cuba, entrance is allowed.)
