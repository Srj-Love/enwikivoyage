Plans for drilling the oil and for an 800 mi pipeline were thrown together at a dizzying speed, as the U.S. government and oil companies worked to settle land claims with Native Americans, attain proper permits, ensure environmental safeguards, and build ways of accessing this extremely remote area. The Dalton Highway was hastily constructed in just 5 months, in 1974, to provide access for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline under construction. It was built at a similar, dizzying pace, price, and fashion as the nearby ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alaska Highway"]]},", constructed during World War Two.\n\nOriginally called the ",{"type":"''","value":["North Slope Haul Road"]}," (or simply the \"Haul Road\", as some locals still call it), it was built as a supply road and intended for large tractor-trailers rather than private vehicles. After completion of the pipeline, the road remained as a supply route for oil operations at Prudhoe Bay. In 1981 the haul road was opened to the public (with a permit) until Disaster Creek at Mile 211, given the designation Alaska Route 11, and named in honor of James W. Dalton, a man who aided in the development of the Cold War's Distant Early Warning System and whose knowledge of northern Alaska greatly aided the oil exploration of the region. In 1994, the public was allowed access to the entire highway to Mile 414 in Deadhorse, without permits. The road was formerly gravel for its entire length, but in recent years a long-term paving project has been undertaken. The Dalton Highway is paved from Mile 37 to Mile 49; Mile 90 to Mile 197 (Gold Creek); and from Mile 335 (Happy Valley\nairstrip) to Mile 362. Due to the extreme temperature variations and frost heave, paved sections are prone to potholes and large cracks and some paved sections are worse than unpaved sections.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],[{"type":"''","value":["Now That's Cold!"]}],["The coldest temperature ever recorded in the United States was measured in Prospect Creek, Alaska.

If being passed from behind, it is often best to find a safe place to pull off and let the other driver by. This will let them pass at a safe speed and reduce the risk of road debris being kicked up onto your vehicle (it's also just good manners). Additionally, there are many potholes on the road (more so on paved parts), some big enough to swallow basketballs. Such dangers can wreak havoc on a small car's suspension and you might be left with a few scratches and dents on your car (ie. don't take your new Mercedes down this road). A vehicle such as an SUV or pickup truck is preferred due to their ruggedness and ability to cope with road conditions. One Fairbanks car rental agency claims that large sedans are better due to their lower center of gravity, but since sedans are what they rent (for a rental cost similar to larger, newer, & more expensive trucks & SUVs), that may not be entirely truthful. Due to considerable damage caused by the low clearance and inexperienced driving, this company no longer rents sedans.\n\nRefer to the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fairbanks"]]}," article regarding reaching Fairbanks by car. The southern terminus of the Dalton Highway can be reached by car from Fairbanks via the Steese Highway then, at Fox (11 mi [18 km] north of Fairbanks), the Elliot Highway; both road segments are numbered as Alaska Route 2. The Dalton Highway begins at Livengood (no services), Mile 73 of the Elliot Highway. Follow the signs to the Dalton Highway. It is about an hour and a half drive from Fairbanks to Livengood. There are no gas stations between Fairbanks and the start of the Dalton. Once on the Dalton Highway, there is gas available at the Yukon River and at Coldfoot ($5.39 per gallon in summer 2011).

While the price for such a tour could be more expensive for a family than renting your own car to take on the highway, for individuals and couples the cost of a tour may outweigh the costs and hassles of renting a vehicle. The biggest advantage of taking a tour bus is the lack of concern for breaking down, battling trucks speeding by, and concern for things like gas and food. However, the tour bus limits one's flexibility while on the trip and most tour buses take two days going to Deadhorse and one back.
