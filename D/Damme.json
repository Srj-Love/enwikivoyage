You then need to walk 10 minutes to the boat dock. If the drawbridge at Sasplein is up to let a boat go through, then get off at Brugge Gistfabriek as the bus may make a long detour rather than wait for the bridge to lower. The stop Brugge Sint-Josef may be closer to the wharf, but you may need a map to find your way. Google Maps show bus stop locations in Bruges(Brugge).
