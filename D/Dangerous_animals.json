Some species such as hyenas and wolverines have a reputation for being bad-tempered enough to attack more-or-less anything that comes in range. Large predators, such as crocodiles and big cats, may see humans as prey. Other species, such as hippos, are not predatory but are generally considered extremely dangerous.

Getting too close to a cow is not very likely to get you gored or trampled, and most large dogs are unlikely to savage you.

Animals that travel in groups are also much more dangerous; you might survive an encounter with one angry buffalo or wolf, but against a whole herd or pack your chances would be very slim indeed.\n\nVery few animal species regard human beings as prey.

It is always safer to hike in noisy groups rather than solo.\n\nRunning away can activate the bear's hunting instincts and lead to it perceiving the human as prey. Climbing a tree is also not the best idea, as black bears are good climbers and grizzlies have occasionally been known to climb trees as well. If a bear does charge, you should muster your courage and hold your ground, as most bear charges are bluffs. Finally, if a bear does attack, the usual advice is to curl into a fetal position so as to shield vital organs and appear non-threatening. Bear spray - a special form of pepper spray - is available in some areas for additional protection.  However be warned that bear spray is designed to make a large short blast that only lasts a few seconds so proximity to the bear is key.  Most bear sprays come with a safety so make sure you understand how the safety works and wear your bear spray where it can easily be accessed in an emergency.\n\nIf this is not effective in stopping the attack, the only option left is to fight the bear in any way you can. This advice applies to omnivores such as brown and black bears; the best way to avoid being attacked by the completely carnivorous polar bear is not to enter any area where polar bears live, or at least remain inside a hard-shell vehicle or building.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Bear resistant food storage canister 2.JPG"],["200px"],["thumbnail"],["Bear resistant food storage canister, lid can be locked into place using a coin, a key or any similar object."]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Food storage and garbage disposal"]},"\nBears are opportunistic omnivores with an excellent sense of smell, and are attracted to human and pet foods as well as refuse. Improper storage of these items can allow bears to eat human food and become dependent on it, increasing the probability of encounters with humans. Most brown and black bear encounters in populated areas involve so-called \"trouble bears\", usually young males who have just left their mothers and do not yet have a territory of their own. If they wander close to human settlements, the smells of cooking and garbage can cause them to ignore their usual instinct to avoid humans. Many parks and people in areas with bears utilize bear-resistant garbage cans and dumpsters for this reason, and many areas have laws prohibiting the feeding of bears, even unintentionally.\n\nCampers can access bear-proof containers at many parks to store their food and trash and they may be required in some areas. The containers are then buried or strung on a rope between two tall trees, out of bears' reach. They are also instructed to put their containers, campfire, and tenting 100 meters away from each other, forming a triangle.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Boars"]},"\nWild boar attacks on humans are not common but do occur occasionally. Usually, boars, like most wild animals, will avoid interactions with humans. Due to the clearing of natural boar habitats, the number of interactions, including aggressive ones, between humans and boars has increased. When dealing aggressively with a human, boars will charge at them. Sometimes, these may be bluff charges but, in other cases, violent contact will be made. While the impact of the large, hard-skulled head may cause considerable damage itself, most damage is inflicted by the boar's tusk. When ramming into a person, the boar will slash the tusks upwards, creating sizeable open lacerations on the skin. Due to the height of the boar relative to a human, most wounds are inflicted to the upper legs. Some attacks are provoked, such as when hunters wound a boar which then counterattacks. Male boars become most aggressive during the mating season and may charge at humans at such times. Occasionally, female boars will attack if they feel their piglets are threatened, especially if a human physically comes between them and their young.

While hippopotamuses rest near each other in the water, grazing is a solitary activity and hippos are not territorial on land.
