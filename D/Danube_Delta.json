Georghe. He was born in that village, studied ecology in Romania and the US, speaks fluent french and English and can show you the joys and downsides of delta ecology. He loves the area, takes pains not to disturb the ecosystem and knows some old, hidden channels. Once a year he goes on a two week canoe tour deep into the delta to study the ecological impact of pollution and development. If you want to know where to camp, how to avoid snakes, what plants to eat and how to cool beer to ideal temperature, he can help. Prices start from 50 \/ 45 lei per person per 2 hours. Longer half day trips 350 lei per boat (up to 4 passengers).\nHis parents run a pleasant hostel in a sidestreet which he wants to turn into an ecology center. Ask for rooms or homemade fish. The guy is a world away from average tour operators, who tend to throw their beer bottles into the water and chase Pelikans so you can take a good picture."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Iliuta Goean"],["alt=surub"],["url=http:\/\/en.fotodelta.ro"],["email="],["address=Danube Delta, Uzlina"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Uzlina"],["phone=+40 724089280"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Guided photography tours"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["45.0833"],["29.5"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Northern Dobruja"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Danube Delta"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Danube Delta"]]}]
