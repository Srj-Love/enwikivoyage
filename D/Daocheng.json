Duration: about 3-4 hours.\nAlternatively (in particular if the buses are full), you can share a minivan; just be at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Xiangcheng"]]}," bus station around 5.30am, and the drivers will look for people to bring to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sangdui"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Litang"]]},".

In winter, is a must to ask at least for an electric blanket in the sleeping places (but again, be aware that electricity fails very often). Don't forget that temperature can be as low as -20°!
