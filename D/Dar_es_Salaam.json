Taxi drivers are not associated to any public transport company (they run their own business) but they are regulated by the government. Look for white license plates and a taxi number painted on the side. Taxis also have official receipts. The cars have a recognizable paint job and always stay parked at specific points across the city (in great numbers), some few of them even during the night, but can only be reached via personal mobile phones. Taxi fares are not fixed.\n\nDuring the night, taxis are still available, but they remain at their usual corners around the city but can only be reached via their personal mobile phones. Since most streets outside city center (and even within) lack totally of any type of light source it is totally recommended against to walk to those corners where the taxis stay during the night, then it implies an unreliable service as only if the taxi driver that is usually contacted by the tourist is around can he get a service during the night, therefore risking getting stuck at either, the rented apartment or even worse at any other location around the city (specially if it's not a popular night destination).\n\nA price must be negotiated before your begin traveling, or the price will be considerably higher once you reach your destination.

You'll either find one on the side of the road or one will drive past. Cars owned by drivers are often maintained at a high level; taking a smooth air-conditioned trip around Dar is entirely possible if you know the right driver!\n\nIf you plan on hiring a taxi for a long journey, inspect the quality of the tires, which are often extremely worn.\n\nDon't hesitate to tell the driver to slow down. \"Pole Pole\" in Swahili.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["To\/from the airport to\/from the city center"]}," – the price is around 30,000 Tzs.

Up to three people can fit in the seat behind the driver.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By minibus (daladala)"]},"\nThe most common form of public transportation in Dar are minibuses which go by the name \"daladala\". These minibuses go by a specific route with the start and ending point clearly marked on the front of the vehicle.  At the main stations (Ubungo, Posta, Mwenge) daladalas from each route do stop to collect passengers at the same stop at the station.  It's fine to ask someone were to find the daladala you're looking for, the newspaper\/phonecard sellers are often quite helpful.\n\nUntil 2012 the daladalas were mostly minivans (Toyota Hiace, etc.), but due to city regulations they have all been exchanged with minibuses to try to reduce the traffic jams. They are still crowded, but have somewhat more space, and are more comfortable if you have to stand. Outside of  Dar, and on routes going from the city to smaller places outside of it, the old minivans are still commonplace.\n\nAlthough nowadays most major streets have designated bus stops, you can often jump on and off anywhere along the route by simply yelling “out”: “",{"type":"''","value":["Shusha!"]},"” (pronounced SHOO-sha).\n\nTheir popularity is due to their ready availability and low cost, (around TSh400\/= per ride. This varies by route, longer rides such as Posta-->Mombasa are Tsh600\/=.  The fare is indicated on the outside of the daladala, normally painted onto the door).  However, tourists should be aware that drivers will pile in as many people as possible, there is no airconditioning, some drive like maniacs, and the overall condition of the vehicles is poor, with many frequently breaking down along the way. That being said, travelers should not hesitate to use them for getting around. Watch out for pickpockets as you get into and leave crowded vehicles.  Except for early in the day, Daladalas often have change (more than most restaurants\/dukas (stores)), so its actually often pretty good place to break a Tsh 10,000\/= bill.\n\nIt helps if you know a little Kiswahili and are at least a little familiar with the city when using daladalas.

They all go to the central post office on Maktaba\/Azikiwe St. Since they tend to be very crowded, you should guard your belongings. This is especially true when you are at large bus stations such as Mwenge.\n\nBoarding daladalas in city centre stations (Posta, Kariakoo) is a competitive undertaking during the evening rush. People will climb the bus windows to get in earlier and get a seat. It's wise to avoid leaving the city center during the peak of the rush hour, 4:30 to 6:30PM entirely.\nOften, if there are many people waiting for a certain daladala (like the popular Ubungo to Posta) and there is a scramble to get on, if you just wait for the next one you'll have no problem getting on, and might even get a seat!\nNote: That the same will happen on your destination (Ubungo, Posta, Mwenge, …) and sometimes people will start entering the bus already a couple of stops ahead of your destination to get a seat for the trip back. If you notice so, get off and walk the rest to avoid not being able to get off the bus.\n\nPickpockets are at work at outlying daladala terminals after the sun sets. Have awareness of your pockets, especially when boarding a bus. Turn that awareness meter up if you are boarding from Mwenge or Ubungo.\n\nThe best part of using the daladala system is that locals will often strike up friendly conversations and are always willing to help you with your Kiswahili.

You sit behind the driver; it is however not common to hold your hands around the driver, instead you hold on to the luggage rack behind you.\n\nEven though the bodabodas are cheap and efficient, they are also very dangerous. Due to their small size other drivers seldom pay much heed to them, and their habit of zigzagging between vehicles can lead to dangerous situations. Also, though they usually have helmets for themselves, it is very rare for bodabodas to keep spare helmets for the passengers.

There is a small restaurant on the island which serves a variety of foods and drinks (grilled prawns, fish and chips, egg and chips, beer etc.).

There is also a somewhat nicer, though more expensive, bar on the northern end of the beach.  The rest of the island is mostly rough cliff face, which can make for some interesting hiking, though this is not advised if you don't have good shoes and dependable balance (the rocks are very sharp and scrambling is sometimes required).

Like all things, negotiating is key.\n\nSome reputable shops to buy best Tanzanite are Gem Point, Royal Jewellers, Queens Jewellers located at Indiragandhi street, in the center of town.\n\nIf you are a serious Tanzanite buyer looking for quality and selection then you should definitely check out the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.tanzanites.net\/ Tanzanite Dream"]}," located just outside the city centre on the Mataka road behind the fire station.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nDue in part to the growth of the expatriate community and the increasing importance of tourism, the number of international restaurants has risen very rapidly over recent years. The city now offers a rich and internationalized diversity of cuisine, ranging from traditional Tanzanian Barbecue style options such as Nyama Choma (Roasted meat – served with rice or ugali) and Mishkaki (Shish kebab – usually barbecued and served with salt, hot peppers, chapati, fries, and rice on the side), and the long-established traditional Indian and Zanzibari cuisine, to options from all corners of the globe including Chinese, Thai, Turkish, Italian, and Japanese food. Restaurants like City Garden, Addis in Dar, and Best Bite are only a few of the most popular restaurants located in Dar es Salaam. Even fast food restaurants like Steers and Subway now have prominent places in the restaurant sector of Dar es Salaam. People who prefer neither fast food or traditional restaurants buy their food from street vendors, who usually sell good food for very affordable prices. Samosas are common street food items within the city.

Rapes and murders often go unreported and little data exists to suggest how common these crimes are. Domestic violence and sexual harassment, which often goes well beyond verbal cat-calling, are extremely common. Foreign female students have documented multiple accounts of sexual assault and\/or rape. These cases often go unreported\/under-reported by universities with study abroad programs in Tanzania, and of course by the Tanzanian authorities themselves. Walking alone at night outside the most exclusive areas (think Oyster Bay, the Slipway, Sea Cliff, etc.) is extremely inadvisable for foreigners. Men stand a high chance of being mugged, women of being mugged and\/or sexually assaulted. Dar is often very poorly lit. The city experiences a great many power outages. This makes lone women particularly vulnerable.\n\nMost travelers who are in Dar on a short stay will, fortunately, not face these challenges. Similarly, most expatriates who live in Dar are sequestered well enough (with cars, security guards, in upscale neighborhoods, etc.) not to have to worry about this sort of thing.\n\nBy far the most common crimes, and the biggest risk for most travelers, will be muggings and petty thefts. Muggings occur very frequently, including sometimes on the street in broad daylight. Sometimes, but not always, the victim gets roughed up. Foreign students at the University of Dar es Salaam have been mugged at machete point. Never carry your wallet anywhere easily accessible (a back pocket, an outside flap of a backpack or purse, etc.).\n\nParticularly to avoid:\n\n- walking on the beach (like Cocoa Beach) while carrying valuables, as many of these places are invisible from the road. Dar can be a friendly place, and you can certainly have a comfortable time there, but avoid carrying valuables as you may get unlucky. You can walk in the city in the evening but as it gets darker and you see fewer people on the street, exercise real caution. It might be better to take a taxi. If you are noticeably foreign, remember that many people will assume you are rich and an easy target.\n\n- Parking on dark sectors in the beach (coco beach) as thieves and junkies crouch in the dark waiting for the unaware foreigner to park, turn-off the engine and leave the car (to have a nice view of the Dar night from the beach) only to come in groups of 4-5 to steal as much as they can (in the case of a male foreigner). In the case of a female foreigner this is an absolute Not To Do.\n\nParking in a place without a guard runs you the serious risk of having lights or other car parts extracted.  It is not uncommon for people to try to steal things through open windows, while you are waiting for lights to change, or to open unlocked doors and either get in or swipe something! Some people have had passersby attempt to snatch purses off their laps while they've been sitting in the back of a taxi at an intersection.\n\nThere is a major police station at Selendar Bridge on Ocean Road and other police posts in various other places. If you don't follow the driving rules (or sometimes even if you do) you will spend time and money, either discussing with them their price or more formally in the police station. Police here ask for lifts regularly to get places but you are not obliged to take them if you feel uncomfortable. There is a great deal of corruption in Tanzania. Skin color, bribes, and connections to known elites in town still, unfortunately, hold a lot of sway.\n\nA number of visitors have reported been pickpocketed in crowds at the Posta daladala stand recently (2009).  If you're walking past this it's best to cross the road to avoid the crowd.  If you're getting a daladala be aware of your possessions, be particularly aware of people stopping suddenly in front of you – this is sometimes done to block you in while someone behind you goes through your bags.  Other well known pickpocket sites are the ferry to Kigamboni (nb. not the Zanzibar ferry), the Mnazi Mmoja dala stand, the trinket stalls on Samora Av and Karriakoo market.  There's no reason to avoid these areas; just be aware of your possessions when you are there, particularly bags.  Using razor blades to cut into bags to remove items is quite common – and really annoying.\n\nIf you are robbed, you have a few options. None of them are good. You can yell, \"mwizi!\" This means 'thief' in Swahili. If you do this in a crowded place, you will very likely incite a mob to form. The mob might corner the thief and detain him until the police arrive. They might also beat up the thief very badly, possibly to the point of death. Theft carries huge risks in a culture where people possess very few material goods. The social punishments for stealing can be brutal beatings or, in some cases, death. Weigh the worth of your $40 cell phone or purse against the potential results of fomenting a stir. If you are in a crowded place (like the downtown Posta daladala stand, for example), you will, at the very least, create a gigantic scene, probably cause someone to be beaten, and have to spend a day dealing with the Dar es Salaam police department in sweltering, inefficient conditions. Much more practical just to exercise extreme care with how you carry your belongings, and to avoid carrying valuables (i.e. anything you can't afford to lose) altogether.\n\nBe careful when taking taxis at night, particularly if you are alone, where possible use a driver you know or ask someone to call a taxi for you. If staying in Dar for an extended period of time, try to get the phone numbers of the first fair, seemingly trustworthy cabbies you encounter. Keep using them. If you are living in Dar without a car, this will greatly increase your safety. Taking buses at night and walking in poorly lit areas alone or in small groups (particularly of women, noticeable foreigners, or other people who might look like 'easy targets') is a great way to increase the risk of something bad happening (mugging, rape, etc.). Split taxis when possible. Some travellers have narrowly escaped potentially violent muggings and\/or rape and others were not so fortunate.\n\nRemember that, generally speaking, the more you stand out, the higher your risk factor will be.
