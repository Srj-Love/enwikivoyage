For foreign tourists, the main attractions are the cultural diversity (many Tibetan refugees moved here after Tibet was annexed by China and they co-exist with the descendants of the many Nepali and Bihari laborers brought to work in the tea plantations), the beautiful views (including the wonderful vista view of Kanchenjunga), a variety of trekking options, and the opportunity to cool down after a stint in the plains. The town is also a jumping off point for travelers heading to Sikkim.\n\nThere has been intermittent political action from Gorkha groups demanding an independent state (Gorkhaland). In June 2008 a strike paralyzed the area, with closed hotels, restaurants and shops, and the accompanying protests even turned violent a couple of times.

They leave when full, and are a cheap, fast and reasonably comfortable way to get to Darjeeling.\n\nIf you have arrived by train at New Jalpaiguri, you can take a taxi or shared jeep to reach Darjeeling from the booking counter at the taxi stand in front of the railway station. There is also a prepaid taxi stand in front of the train station. Note that if you arrive too late for the jeep to make a return journey from Darjeeling, you may end up paying more, e.g. Rs.200 per person. The prepaid counter will tell you that no jeeps are available, so you'll have to find one via a fixer or by negotiating directly with drivers.\n\nTourists often opt to buy an extra seat or two to have more space for the 3 hour journey up to Darjeeling! Luggage is carried for free on the roof. Jeeps may stop for a snack and toilet break on the way up (normally a few km short of Kurseong).\n\nReserve cars are available from Kings Travels,dial: 098304-28401\/ 093319-39486 for tour purpose in Darjeeling.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nThere is a regular bus service from Silguri to Darjeeling.

There is also a train from Howrah Station called Paharia Express which departs Howrah Station at 21:55 and arrives New Jalpaiguri at 8:45.\n\nFrom there, the famous Darjeeling Himalayan Railway (DHR), known to all as the 'Toy Train' completes the journey to Darjeeling. The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway was the first, and is still the most outstanding, example of a hill passenger railway. It is now listed as a World Heritage Site declared by UNESCO.\n\nThis route is very popular with tourists as it passes through some very picturesque mountain scenery and has been the subject of many romantic articles. The line has a series of zig zags and loops to gain height and runs straight up several village main streets! Trains depart New Jalpaiguri at 9AM and arrives in Darjeeling at 3:30. Now the train is diesel hauled is reasonably reliable and punctual.\n\nNJP to Darjeeling Toy Train service is suspended after railway track damage due to recent earth-quake. The service will not be restored till June 2014.

It leaves Darjeeling at 16:00 arriving Kurseong at 18:30.\nThis is still hauled by a steam engine and is one of the last 'day to day'\/ordinary  steam trains running anywhere in the world.

For longer trips, taxis are available in stands near the entrance to the Supermarket.\n\nA great way to spend a day is to take a share-jeep to Ghoom (the next town up the ridge), visit some monasteries there and walk back to Darjeeling via some of the villages.\n\nOne can also walk to the Botanical garden and spend few pleasant hours appreciating the nature; the green house has quite a nice collection of flowers there. Then, there is a Rock garden which is very much at a (slightly longish) walkable distance. One can also walk to the Zoo and then to the ropeway at North Point. A walk to the Peace Pagoda and then to Jalapahar is also quite refreshing. Its quite interesting to have a leisurely walk on the Mall road and then one can sit and relax for hours in the soothing sun at Chowrasta.\n\nTake caution when walking at night however, as many feral dogs roam the street once the sun goes down. If approached by an aggressive dog in the street, acting as though you are picking up a rock to throw will usually deter them.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Kangchenjunga from Tiger Hill.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["View of Kunchenjunga from Tiger Hill"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Darjeeling Toy Train at Batasia Loop.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["Toy Train at Batasia Loop"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Himalayan Mountaineering Institute(HMI)"],["url=http:\/\/www.himalayanmountaineeringinstitute.com\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=naveen"],["phone = +91 9711100094"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=This is one of the most visited spot in Darjeeling.

The park can also be accessed from Rimbik, where many trekkers finish up, or from Bijanbari, with one extra day's walking. Trekkers must pay a 100rp fee to enter the park, and must hire a guide. Porters can also be hired in Maneybhanjeng. Many trekkers sign up for a 3, 5 or 6 day trek in Darjeeling, where various trekking companies make all of the arrangements. Passports must be carried, as the trek crosses briefly into Nepal, then back into India. Sleeping bags and layered warm clothing are a must, as the temperature dips well below freezing most nights. Overnight lodging is done at assorted huts or simple guesthouses along the way, and hot meals are available at the same. Starting from Maneybhanjang, most trekkers stay overnight in Gairbas or Kalipokhari, and press on to Sandakphu for the 2nd night. Sandakphu at 3636 meters, is a favorite spot to view the high Himalayan peaks of LLotze, Everest, Makalu, etc., in early morning when visibility is good. 3 day trekkers turn aside and head downhill to Rimbik for their final night, while others head further north for spectacular views from Sabarkum and Phalut, then downhill for Raman, and finish in Rimbik for the last night. For greater cash outlay, non-trekkers, or those pressed for time can hire a jeep as transport from Maneybhanjang to Sandakphu, and stay overnight to catch the sunrise views.
