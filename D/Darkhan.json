The city, which name means \"Blacksmith\" in Mongolian, was built as a manufacturing base by the Soviets in 1961 on the Trans-Mongolian Railroad. Much of the industrial base collapsed in the early 1990s, and most of its once large Russian population left. Today it is home to a large steel mill, textile industry, and many universities. It has an expansive layout with open steppe and roaming cattle right into the center of the city. The city is divided into a 'new' and 'old' sections separated by some small hills and ger districts spreading out beyond the developed areas. The railroad station, main Buddhist temple, and the black market are in the Old Darkhan, while most of the nicer hotels, restaurants, and shopping centers, along with the universities and cultural centers are in New Darkhan.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh = -16"],["febhigh = -12"],["marhigh =  1"],["aprhigh =   11"],["mayhigh =  19"],["junhigh =   24"],["julhigh =   26"],["aughigh =   24"],["sephigh =   18"],["octhigh =   9"],["novhigh =   -3"],["dechigh =   -13"],["janlow =   -28"],["feblow =   -26"],["marlow =  -15"],["aprlow =   -4"],["maylow =  3"],["junlow =   10"],["jullow =   13"],["auglow =  12"],["seplow =  3"],["octlow =   -5"],["novlow =   -16"],["declow =   -25"],["janprecip =  5"],["febprecip =  4"],["marprecip =  6"],["aprprecip =  13"],["mayprecip =  22"],["junprecip =  63"],["julprecip =  92"],["augprecip =  82"],["sepprecip =  41"],["octprecip =  15"],["novprecip =  8"],["decprecip =  6"],["description = NOAA (1961-1990)"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nThere is a station on the Trans-Mongolian line of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Trans-Siberian Railway"]]}," with regular service to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ulaanbaatar"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Irkutsk"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Erdenet"]]},".
