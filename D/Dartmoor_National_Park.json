The stamp designs are limited only by the imagination of the person who placed them, and come in a very wide range sizes. As you find each box you record your visit by taking an impression of the located stamp. Finding the boxes usually requires a series of clues, ranging from the very easy, to the fiendishly difficult. Most letterboxes are placed on the moor by private individuals, who give their clues to friends and family. Some clues will be made available for the wider community to find. Some boxes are placed by charities\/groups wishing to raise a little money. These charity boxes normally form the basis of a circular route, in a particular part of Dartmoor, and usually consist of a set of stamps with a common theme. These are also only available for a short period and the clue sheets are sold for a nominal fee. Most people who do letterboxing on a regular basis will usually have their own stamp which they carry around with them to put in the notepad of the boxes they find.\n\nLetterboxing on Dartmoor has a big following in the local region and beyond. You will find people who go out for an hour or two on their way home from work, as well as people who come down from all over, to spend a week walking to find new and exciting stamps.\n\nThe number of boxes is constantly changing as people lose, update or simply remove stamps.\n\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.dartmoorletterboxing.org\/ Letterboxing on Dartmoor."]},{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.plympton.info\/dartmoor\/ Dartmoor Letterboxes Funstuff"]},{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.letterboxingondartmoor.co.uk\/ Official website"]},{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Letterboxing Wikipedia Info"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nThe Old Police Station in Princetown serves some of the best fish and chips on the moors.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Peter Tavy Inn"]}," - 15th century."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Plume of Feathers, Princetown"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cornwood Inn"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mary Tavy Inn"]}," - 16th century"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Royal Oak, Meavy"]}," - origins in 15th century - a very ancient oak tree on the village green (royal connections???)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Rugglestone Inn"]}," - superb traditional inn at Widecombe."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Old Inn, Widecombe"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Fingle Bridge Inn"]},"ellent setting near Drewsteignton."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Drewe Arms, Drewsteignton"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Elephant's Nest, Horndon, Mary Tavy"]}," - 16th century - great Moorland location."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Walkhampton Inn"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[" Dartmoor Inn, Lydford"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Dartmoor Inn, Merrivale"]}," - on the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tavistock"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Princetown"]]}," road -"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Moorland View"],["alt=Boutique thatched holiday cottage"],["url=http:\/\/www.moorlandview.com"],["email="],["address=North Bovey"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Near Moretonhampstead"],["phone = +44 7786 264865"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=£120\/night"],["checkin=4.30pm"],["checkout=10.30pm"],["content=Boutique, thatched self-catering holiday cottage dating from 1705.

A fair number who aren't denoted as campsites on Ordnance Survey maps nevertheless will offer a pitch for a nominal fee (a few pounds per night).
