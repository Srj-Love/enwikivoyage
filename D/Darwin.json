People from more than 50 nations make up its population of 110,000. It is located on the Northern Territory coast (in north-central ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Australia"]]},"), with the Timor Sea (a branch of the Indian Ocean) to the west, and the Arafura Sea to the north in Indonesian waters.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nDarwin has a relaxed lifestyle and unique multiculturalism, where people from over 50 different cultures live and work side by side. The regular Asian-style markets form an intrinsic part of the everyday Darwin landscape, for local residents see food, music, language, and culture from just about every Asian nation, alongside \"crocodile hunters\", local Aboriginal artists, musicians of every genre, sports fishing operators, sunset sails, and families with children playing on the beach. Darwin's unique cosmopolitan makeup has been recognised as an \"multicultural icon of national significance\" by the Australian National Trust.\n\nDarwin's tropical climate has two major seasons: the 'dry', from about May to October, and the 'wet', from November to April. There is also the 'build up', the time from the end of the dry, leading into the wet when the humidity rises, but the rain doesn't fall.  The arrival of the wet is always a welcome break from the buildup.\n\nMajor cyclones have occurred approximately once every three decades. Much of the city was destroyed by Cyclone Tracy in 1974. More recent cyclones have not been as dangerous, and building codes and emergency procedures have improved since then.\n\nDarwin is also the only Australian capital city to have come under substantial attack during a war.  On 19 February 1942, Japanese planes made two major air raids on Darwin from the aircraft carrier fleet that had attacked Pearl Harbor less than 3 months earlier. These were the first of 64 air attacks sustained by the city during World War II, the last being on 12 November 1943. (Other areas in northern ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Queensland"]]}," and northern ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Western Australia"]]}," were also bombed by Japanese aircraft.)\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nDarwin was first named in 1839 by John Lort Stokes during the third voyage of the Beagle.  It was named after his former shipmate and famous naturalist Charles Darwin. Darwin's development was accelerated by the discovery of gold at Pine Creek, about 200 km south of the city in 1871. After the gold rush Darwin's growth slowed mainly due to the harsh, tropical climate, distance and poor communications with other Australian cities. The Second World War put Darwin back on the map when the town became an important base for Allied action against the Japanese in the Pacific. The road south to the railhead at Alice Springs was surfaced, putting the city in direct contact with the rest of the country. Modern Darwin is one of Australia's most cosmopolitan cities, more open to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Asia"]]}," than perhaps any other Australian city. It plays an important role as the door to Australia's northern region. Natural wonders such as Kakadu, Katherine Gorge, and Litchfield are all within driving distance from the city and still contain near pre-colonial populations of crocodiles, goannas, snakes and wallabies.\n\nToday Darwin is a fast growing regional centre that has unique history, culture and adventure.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["Darwin's Climate"],["The following chart outlines Darwin's monthly climate averages as an indicator for the whole northern region.\n\nJan - Feb \nMin average temperature - 24°C (75°F) \nMax average temperature - 31C° (88°F)\n\nMar - Apr \nMin average temperature - 24°C (75°F) \nMax average temperature - 32°C (90°F)\n\nMay - Sept \nMin average temperature - 21°C (69°F) \nMax average temperature - 31°C (88°F)\n\nOct - Dec \nMin average temperature - 25°C (77°F) \nMax average temperature - 32°C (91°F)"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nThe Top End, which includes Darwin, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Katherine"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kakadu National Park"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Arnhem Land"]]},", has a tropical climate.

There is no need to check the weather forecast as it is nearly always 31°C (89°F) and sunny during the day, with cooler nights.\n\nNovember and December is the time the build up, or pre-monsoon season, begins and humidity levels start to rise. The summer rains bring the natural landscape to life and deliver the picturesque storms and sunsets the Northern Territory is renowned for.

The hospital is on Rocklands Drive, Tiwi, on the northern side of Darwin. As you approach Casuarina, blue signs give directions to the hospital, but it is better to familiarise yourself with the Hospital's location before you may need to find it. Darwin Private hospital is situated across the road. Extensive delays may occur for treatment of anything other than very serious illness or trauma injuries at the Accident and emergency section of Royal Darwin Hospital. Be prepared for a long wait, especially on weekends.\n\nDrink plenty of water; at least 1 litre of water for every hour of walking in very warm weather. Ensure you have an adequate fitness level for the bushwalk you plan to undertake.\n\nAvoid walking in the hottest part of the day or walking alone, register with the overnight bushwalking register if you plan an extended walk. Carry a map of the area you're walking\/camping in and know how to read it, tell someone your plan and when you expect to return. Carry a mobile telephone if in a potential coverage area but do not expect coverage anywhere other than very built up areas with good line of sight to a transponder tower. Under no circumstances should you rely on mobile telephony for essential communications unless within the city area. Ensure you are using a mobile telephone service that provides usable coverage in the Northern Territory. Not all of the service providers give even faintly adequate coverage throughout the Darwin area and much less so outside the immediate city and suburban area.

When swimming at local beaches, even in the 'safe' season of June to September, bring vinegar and pour it over the wound if stung. Transport to hospital is a must as the venom of the Box Jellyfish can be deadly - remember CPR.\n\nCrocodiles are very common in waterways, but are only occasionally found on public beaches. The local newspaper loves a good crocodile story.
