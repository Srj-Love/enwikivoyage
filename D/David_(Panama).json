Prices for either are around $15 per person, slightly more for the nighttime express buses (10pm, 11, 12, and 3am from the David bus terminal). It's a 7 hour ride. The buses are modern, relatively safe, keep track of luggage well, and will probably show a second-rate action movie, though maintenance leaves something to be desired, especially in the bathrooms. Both companies stop in the city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Santiago de Veraguas"],["Santiago"]]}," on the way to David for bathroom breaks and food. Highly suggested that you try some of the food they serve at these stops. Also, you'll find a cart where they sell sweets (mini chocolate eggs and another square treat called cocada), try them out.\n\nDavid is also served by many \"Coaster\" local buses, which you can often flag down along the Interamericana to get to David. (During peak times, sometimes they'll even run Coasters from Panama City.) They're definitely less safe and usually less comfortable; you may end up standing for much of the trip.\n\nOthers destinations from the David bus terminal include Paso Canoas border with Costa Rica (1 h 30, $2), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boquete"]]}," (1 h, $1.75), and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Almirante"]]}," for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bocas del Toro"]]}," and the Atlantic coast (4 h, $8.50, look for buses to Changuinola, which is a bit past Almirante).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nBy car:\nThere are stop signs at most intersections, but in spanish \"Alto\" means two things, 1. stop, and 2.

It all depends on what one likes. There are a few Casinos in the city that you can visit, the two most popular ones are Royal Casino, and the Fiesta Casino (Fiesta is in the Hotel Gran Nacional). There's a few nightclubs to go to, $3 cover, no dress code, $20 for bottle service (Carta Vieja Rum), which is what most people get here. It also depends on what time of year  you visit. There's different types of festivals throughout the year, but the best ones are in the beginning of the year, timed with the Carnavales in different parts of the country.\n\nThere's plenty of adventure sport and naturalist activities for those so inclined within an hour's drive all over the Province of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chiriqui"]]},".\n\nA pleasant day trip from David is to the Los Pozos de Caldera hot springs. These are very undeveloped but in a way this just makes you feel you've strayed from the beaten track a little. To get there, take a Caldera-bound bus from the David bus terminal (USD2) and tell the driver you want to go to the springs. About an hour later, you will be dropped off at a junction where you can walk 2.5km down a paved but bumpy road to the spring entrance, crossing an unusual mini-suspension bridge on the way. From the \"Bienvenidos a Los Pozos\" sign, walk along the trail as indicated (this can be a little rough, so wear sensible shoes and expect a little mud in the rainy season) until you come to a \"private property\" sign with a small house beyond. At this point you can pay the owners (USD2) and pass on to the small but pleasantly warm pools beyond. Take care not to leave too late as buses back to David get thin on the ground later in the day. If you do run into problems, you can ask the small restaurant near the junction to call you a taxi, which will cost about USD20.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nThe most popular place is \"Chobeca's Burgers\" which is a Panamanians version of McDonald's. It's cheap, and has nothing to do with burgers. They sell fried Panamanian-type food, try it at least once. Next to the Hotel Gran Nacional (and the Fiesta Casino) is a restaurant called McPato. Now THAT is David's real version of McDonald's from way, way back. The story behind that is that they wanted to bring a McDonald's franchise, but the owner found it to expensive to buy a franchise restaurant, and decided to open his Own. The Mc in the name is obvious, and Pato in spanish means Duck, and Donald is a duck, so the owner figured Mc(obvious)Pato(Donald).

If you are the type of person who just likes to have a beer and relax with some friends, El Hangar (The Hangar) is the place to go. It's a drive-thru bar basically.
