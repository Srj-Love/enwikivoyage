The closest option is Sacramento International Airport (SMF), from which one can then take a shuttle or taxi to Davis. A cheaper alternative is to take Yolobus. For $1.50 the #42 bus will take you to downtown Davis. You can then either utilize Unitrans, the local bus service or take a taxi to your destination. The airport is approximately a 30 minute drive from Davis.\n\nThe Oakland (OAK) and San Francisco (SFO) airports are also options for people who wish to visit the Bay Area as well as Davis. If your trip itinerary does not include the Bay Area, however, then SMF is the best option for commercial air travel to Davis.

Unitrans (the local municipal bus system) also runs quite frequently. For undergraduate students riding is free, for everybody else (including graduate students) one journey costs a dollar.\n\nDowntown Davis is also very pedestrian friendly. The UC Davis campus and the heart of the downtown area run alongside one another and it's easy to stroll through both in a couple of hours.\n\nProbably the worst way to experience Davis is by car.
