Daytona Beach is the best known of the seven area communities. Although the wide 23-mile (37 km) stretch of white sandy beach is still the biggest attraction here, with over 8 million visitors flocking to the area every year, the metro area is rapidly changing from event Mecca to family oriented resort destination. Historical sites like the Main Street Pier, the Oceanfront Boardwalk and the Clocktower in Oceanfront Park add to the appeal of this exciting city.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nDaytona was founded in 1870 by Matthias Day, from whom it takes its name. It was incorporated as a city in 1876. The separate towns of ",{"type":"''","value":["Daytona"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["Daytona Beach"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["Seabreeze"]}," merged to form ",{"type":"'''","value":["Daytona Beach"]}," in 1926. In the 1920s, the city became known as ",{"type":"''","value":["The World's Most Famous Beach."]},"\n\nDaytona's wide beach of smooth, compacted sand attracted automobile and motorcycle enthusiasts beginning in 1902, when pioneers in the industry tested their inventions.  On 8 March 1936, the first stock car race was held on the Daytona Beach Course. In 1959, William France created ",{"type":"'''","value":["Daytona International Speedway"]}," to replace the beach course.\n\nAutomobiles are still permitted on the beach — at much slower speeds! Daytona is one of the few places in the world where a family car can be driven on an ocean beach.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nThe city of Daytona Beach sits on the shore of the Atlantic Ocean and is split in two by the Halifax River. It is bordered on the north by Holly Hill and Ormond Beach and on the south by Daytona Beach Shores, South Daytona, and Port Orange.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Forecast"],["Daytona Beach"],["29.21"],["-81.00"]]},"\n\nDaytona Beach has a very humid subtropical climate typical for a city in the southeastern United States. Summers are hot and humid with highs usually in the 90s (32+°C)and a heat index often exceeding 100°F (38°C). Thunderstorms are frequent in summer afternoons and the hot, humid weather can last through the fall months. Winters are dry and mild, marked by a constant series of cold fronts followed by warmer air. In wintertime, temperatures dip into the low 40s and upper 30s (5°C) on occasion, although freezes are rare.  Frost occurs a few times a year mainly in the inland areas. Snowfall is extremely rare: the last time snow flurries fell on Daytona Beach was in January 2003. Temperatures in spring are famously pleasant with warm afternoons, cool evenings, and far less humidity. This beautiful weather usually attracts tourists back to the beaches by early March.\n\n",{"type":"{|","value":[["class=\"wikitable\" \"text-align:center;font-size:90%;\"|"],["| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;\"|Monthly Normal and Record High and Low Temperatures"],["|-"],["!
