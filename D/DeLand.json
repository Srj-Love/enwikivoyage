DeLand. It was founded in 1876, and incorporated in 1882. In 1883, Henry A. DeLand established DeLand Academy. Later, DeLand entrusted the academy to his friend John B. Stetson, a wealthy hat manufacturer from Philadelphia and a founding trustee. In 1889, it was renamed John B. Stetson University after its new patron. The name was later shortened to Stetson University, and in 1900 it became the first law school in Florida. The University's sports teams are called the Mad Hatters. \n\nDeLand grew during the 1920s Florida Land Boom.

One of those seasons is hot and rainy, lasting from May until October (roughly coinciding with the Atlantic hurricane season). The other is a cooler season (November through March) that brings more moderate temperatures and less frequent rainfall. The area's warm and humid climate is caused primarily by its low elevation and its position relatively close to the Tropic of Cancer, and much of its weather is affected by the movement of the Gulf Stream.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nNearby International airports include:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Daytona Beach International Airport (DAB)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Sanford Orlando International Airport (SFB)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Orlando International Airport (MCO)"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By train "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Deland Amtrak front01.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["The DeLand AMTRAK train station"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Amtrak"]}," offers the ",{"type":"''","value":["Amtrak Auto Train"]}," service with its southern Terminus located in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sanford (Florida)"],["Sanford"]]},", a few miles southwest of DeLand.
