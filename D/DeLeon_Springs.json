DeLeon Springs State Park is comprised of 603 acres, and swimming is popular here as the water remains at 72Â°F year-round. The Park is built around a natural sulphur spring, flowing at a rate of about 20 million gallons a day, that remains 72 degrees Fahrenheit year-round and reaches a depth of 30 feet at the spring boil.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nDeLeon Springs was first settled as early as 8000 BCE by local Native American tribes. In the 1500s, Spanish forces passed through. Land was granted near the springs to settlers to establish a plantation called \"Spring Garden\" where corn, cotton, and sugar cane were grown. Around this time, the Seminole Indians began to settle in the area.\n\nThe area came under American ownership after Florida became a territory in 1821; Colonel Orlando Rees built a mill to grind the corn and sugar. Many facilities were destroyed by Union troops during the American Civil War; however, the waterwheel and building remain on the site to this day, now housing a pancake restaurant called \"The Old Spanish Sugar Mill\", owned and operated by local residents.\n\nThe Seminole tribe regained the land during the Second Seminole War and sacked the plantation; General Zachary Taylor led the U.S. Army forces to gain control of it in 1838.\n\nThe area drew tourists in the 1880s, when it was touted as a fountain of youth and winter resort for the springs' alleged rejuvenating powers.\n\nIn 1982 the State of Florida acquired the land for use as a recreational area.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\nAncient cypress and oak trees dominate the landscape in this part of Florida.
