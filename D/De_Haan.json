Thanks to a clever real estate policy, De Haan has kept the charm of the 1930s, with a lot of white villas and no skyscrapers.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:De Haan - Tram station.jpg"],["thumb"],["Tram station: De Haan aan Zee"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Street scene in De Haan, Belgium.jpg"],["thumb"],["Street scene"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:DeHaan Belgium.jpg"],["thumb"],["Beachfront buildings"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:De Haan Villa Le Coeur Volant, Einstein.JPG"],["thumb"],["Albert Einstein sitting on a park bench"]]},"\nThe coastal tram (",{"type":"''","value":["de Kusttram"]}," in Dutch) is the easiest way to reach De Haan by public transport.

Many buildings are in the ",{"type":"''","value":["belle époque"]}," style. The buildings can be a reason in itself to visit De Haan. Most such buildings of interest are between the tram line and the beach. The commercial buildings (hotels, restaurants) are on the route from the tram station to the beach and along the beach itself. One should also look at the houses along residential streets as almost all have some degree of quaintness. \n\nThe tram station itself is much photographed. The name of the station ",{"type":"''","value":["De Haan aan Zee"]}," literally means the rooster by the sea. Between the tram tracks is a historical sign saying \"don't step on the tracks\" in Dutch on one side and in French on the other. The coastal tram used to be part of a much larger network of cross-country trams (known as the ",{"type":"''","value":["Vicinal"]}," in French and the ",{"type":"''","value":["Buurttram"]}," in Dutch) of which very little remains in operation today.\n\nThere is a small park at the end of the street Normandiëlaan which contains the life-size statue of Albert Einstein sitting on a park bench.
