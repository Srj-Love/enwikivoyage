The best road to take is the one from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Swellendam"]]},".

Although relatively small, you can come close to a number of rare animals. Near the camp are normally big herds of Bontebok (which can also be seen at nearby ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bontebok National Park"]]},"). These white and brown antelopes are only known in the Cape Region. There are also ostriches and elands and other antelopes, baboons and a vast number of birds (be sure to bring a book about the local birds to identify them). Some smaller mammals and reptiles, tortoises and snakes and occasional leopards can be seen.\nThe main attraction however are the whales. The Southern Right Whales have to pass here during the whale season for their breeding grounds. Ten or more wales can sometimes be seen at a time from the beach.\n\nDe Hoop is also home to approximately 1500 species of plant life. 108 of these are threatened and ",{"type":"''","value":["34 only occur in De Hoop"]},". 14 species were recently discovered (!) and are still undescibed.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nYou can drive around in your car, looking for some of the antelopes. This is however not very interesting, as most animals will be near the camp.\nThe better option is to go hiking. There are some wonderful hiking trails starting at the camp. The trail along the dam is highly recommended.\nEven more beautiful are the trails at the beach. Drive towards the beach (Lekkerwater residents are already located there) and leave you car at the bus stop, next to the toilets and information point. From here, either go left along the beach. There are some steep dunes, but all in all this trail is quite easy. Whales and water birds can be seen best from the top of the dunes and cliffs.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["What to bring"]},"\nYou should buy a book about local wild and plant life before you arrive. Important is also that you bring enough food and water (see below), esepcially when staying overnight. Some warm clothes should comfort you in colder nights or when the wind blows. Binoculars and a camera are some of the most important things, if you want to show pictures of this beautiful place to friends and family at home.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat & Drink"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["image:RSA_De_Hoop.jpg"],["thumb"],["Bring a camera to take photos of the coastline!"]]},"\nThere is no shop in De Hoop itself. So be sure to bring something to eat, especially when staying overnight. The shops in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Swellendam"]]}," will offer you everything you will need. \n\nThere is also an outpost near the camp, which caters for some basic needs. Please note that it is closed most of the time.\n\nWhen leaving the De Hoop Gate, turn left immediatly and follow the road for a minute or two. You will end up at a private camp, which also has a restaurant (very good food). If, you want to go there in the evening, tell the staff at the reception, so they can arrange that someone lets you in, once the gates are closed (normally at dusk).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nThere is a camp in De Hoop called the Opstal. You can book accommodation in different chalets and bungalows. There are twenty eight self-catering cottages and houses, all of which are fully equiped. There are also seven campsites and each can accommodate up to six people in tents or caravans.\n\nNear the beach are two houses, called Koppie Alleen and Lekkerwater, which is great for groups.\n\nNo matter if you booked in advance or not, make sure to be at the camp by ",{"type":"'''","value":["16h00"]}," or only shortly later!\n\nReservations can be made at res@dehoopcollection.co.za or view the website at www.dehoopcollection.co.za\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nGo to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bredasdorp"]]}," and visit the famous Kapula Candle factory and shop ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.kapula.com"]},". The candles are have very nice African motives and are sold allover the world.\nFurther on is the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cape Agulhas"]]},", the most southern tip of Africa!\nFrom De Hoop it will take you up to an hour, because of the gravel roads. However, it is a beautiful drive, along the fields and ostrich farms. If you like gravel road, you can continue past the moravion mission village of Elim and rural Baardskeerdersbos to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gansbaai"]]}," on Danger Point Peninsula.\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usablepark"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Overberg"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["related"],["African_National_Parks"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["related"],["African_flora_and_fauna"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:De Hoop Nature Reserve"]]}]
