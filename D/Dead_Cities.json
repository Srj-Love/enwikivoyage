Take a microbus to the city of Ma'aret an Nu'man, and switch to another microbus headed for Kafranbel from there. \n\nOnce there, its probably best to ask for walking directions, and start walking the road to Serjillah. Try waving down any vehicle that goes in the same direction, chances are very good they will offer you a ride free of charge.\n\nThe same approach works for the way back, and anyone taking you for a ride is likely to drop you off somewhere on the microbus route. Make sure to head back in time though, these microbusses cease operation as early as 4 pm.\n\nThe Simeon Monastery can be reached in similar fashion from Aleppo. Take a microbus for Daret'Azze and walk\/hitch a ride from there. \n\nNote that Aleppo has several bus stations closely laid out in a cluster, and it can be a daunting task to find the correct point of departure for your destination. The best source of information are people that work at the stations (food\/drink vendors, drivers). Some will try to sell you an expensive chartered vehicle ride, but many are helpful and will point you in the right direction.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Column of Simeon Syria.jpg"],["right"],["thumb"],["320px"],["Column of Simeon Stylite"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["Ebla (Arabic إيبلا) is a city from circa 2500 BCE excavated by Italians."]},{"type":"*","value":["Sarjila (Arabic:سيرجيلة) is a Christian community from the 5th century CE."]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Itineraries"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Northwestern Syria"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Dead Cities"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Dead cities"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["36.333333333333"],["36.833333333333"]]}]
