The northern part of the Dead Sea receives scarcely 100 mm (4 inches) of rain a year; the southern section receives barely 50 mm (2 inches).  Due to the man-made reduction of the Jordan River (the river waters are 70-90% used for human purposes) and the high evaporation rate of the Dead Sea, the sea is shrinking.  All the shallow waters of the southern end of the sea have been drained and are now salt flats.\n\nAlthough the Dead Sea will never entirely disappear (because evaporation slows down as surface area decreases and saltiness increases), measures are currently being proposed to siphon water from the Red Sea through a series of tunnels or canals in order to replenish the rapidly shrinking waters and provide water and electrical solutions to the surrounding countries.\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units=Metric"],["janhigh=20.5"],["febhigh=21.7"],["marhigh=24.8"],["aprhigh=29.9"],["mayhigh=34.1"],["junhigh=37.6"],["julhigh=39.7"],["aughigh=39.0"],["sephigh=36.5"],["octhigh=32.4"],["novhigh=26.9"],["dechigh=21.7"],["janlow=12.7"],["feblow=13.7"],["marlow=16.7"],["aprlow=20.9"],["maylow=24.7"],["junlow=27.6"],["jullow=29.6"],["auglow=29.9"],["seplow=28.3"],["octlow=24.7"],["novlow=19.3"],["declow=14.1"],["janprecip=7.8"],["febprecip=9.0"],["marprecip=7.6"],["aprprecip=4.3"],["mayprecip=0.2"],["junprecip=0.0"],["julprecip=0.0"],["augprecip=0.0"],["sepprecip=0.0"],["octprecip=1.2"],["novprecip=3.5"],["decprecip=8.3"],["description=Data for Sedom from the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/ims.gov.il\/IMSEng\/CLIMATE Israeli Meteorological Service"]}]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["climate"]}," at the Dead Sea varies depending on the season.

Accidents happen when someone tries to swim normally (stomach first) in the water - the legs will float better than usual and the head will be submerged. Note that this applies to weaker swimmers, and specifically to attempts to swim breaststroke. Breaststroke is also made difficult by the fact that the legs are raised too high in the water to provide normal forward motion when kicking. Moreover, the salt in the water stings cuts and causes great pain if it comes in contact with the eyes, adding to the panic if one's head is under water. A strong swimmer can easily swim freestyle; if you plan to try this, goggles are essential and should be tightly fitted. Although safe for a strong swimmer, and an unusual sensation because of the buoyancy of the water, it is not an undertaking most people are likely to sustain for long.
