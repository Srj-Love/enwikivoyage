[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Deadhorse"]}," (pop.25) is a town located 10 miles (16 km) from Prudhoe Bay and the Arctic Ocean in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Arctic Alaska"]]}," at the end of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dalton Highway"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Understand "]},"\nLike the Dalton Highway, Deadhorse exists to support oil operations in Prudhoe Bay.  While the official population is 25, the town boasts a non-permanent population of 2,000-3,000 employees of the various oil operations. Like Coldfoot and the camp at Mile 60, the facilities for visitors are the same as those built to house construction workers for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. All facilities are simple, prefabricated buildings which were brought to Deadhorse on barge or via the Dalton. Commodities, having to be shipped great distances, are expensive.\n\nNo direct access to the Arctic Ocean, which is 10 miles (16 km) away, exists from Deadhorse.  Special advanced access\/tours via oil field personnel permission requiring photo ID and right of refusal may visit Prudhoe Bay.  Not all tours reach the Bay.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe town is located at the northern terminus, Mile 414, of the Dalton Highway which provides a land link year-round to Fairbanks.\n\nThere is also a modest airport which functions year-round. The airport is served by commercial flights (ie. Boeing 737 aircraft, special: half cargo, half passengers) from Alaska Airlines, normally to Fairbanks, Anchorage, and Barrow. There are also several charter services which can provide flights to\/from this airport, some offering tours which drive up the Dalton, then fly back (or visa versa).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Deadhorse Alaska aerial view.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Deadhorse as seen from the air"]]},"\nThe town is rather small and during the summer months walking is very feasible although there are no sidewalks and large oil field equipment and trucks demand constant vigilance. During the winter, extreme temperatures make walking, even short distances, very uncomfortable and exposure to such temperatures can be lethal. While not very large, driving is the best option most of the year.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See\/Do"]},"\nThe Dalton Highway ends just a few miles inland of the Arctic Ocean and only private, restricted roads extend to the ocean. Fortunately, tours can be booked through the hotels in the town which not only take you to the ocean and its gravel beach (where you can take a frigid dip, joining the \"Polar Bear Club\") but also include a tour of the oilfield and operations. The ocean is ice-free from late July to October.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nThe town contains a small, and pricey, general store as well as two fuel stations.

The coldest recorded wind chill here was -102°F (-74°C)! During the winter, exposure to the elements can prove lethal. \n\nLike nearly all wild areas in Alaska, grizzly bears are a concern.  Don't leave any food lying around including waste food containers, and keep an eye out for bears when walking around. Polar bears are present in the coastal areas predominantly during August and September but can be found at any time during the year. Polar bears are both extremely dangerous and protected, do not approach or harass the bears and get to building or vehicle. Whenever exiting a building, immediately scan your surroundings for polar bears.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nRemember when leaving that there are no services for 240 miles (386 km) until you reach Coldfoot!
