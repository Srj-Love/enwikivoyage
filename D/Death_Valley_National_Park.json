Many potential visitors ignore the park due to the misconception that it is simply a lifeless, empty landscape, but this 3.4 million acre (14,000 km",{"type":"<","value":["sup",["2"]]},") park is not only the largest national park in the contiguous 48 States of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United States of America"],["USA"]]}," (although ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Adirondacks"],["Adirondack"]]}," state park in NY is larger) but also arguably one of the most striking specimens of Mother Earth. Nearly every major geological era is elegantly exposed here in what sometimes appears to be one of her greatest tapestries, gloriously presenting her full spectrum.\n\nThe valley itself is 130 miles (210 km) long, between six and 13 miles (10–21 km) wide and is surrounded by steep mountain ranges: the Panamint mountains to the west, and the Black, Funeral, and Grapevine mountains to the east. Its three million acres of wilderness and rich cultural history make it a lifetime's work to explore all that the valley has to offer.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nThe first non-Native Americans arrived in Death Valley in 1849 looking for a shortcut to the California gold fields. Although only one member of their party died, the name Death Valley was given to the area. Various mining operations used the valley afterwards, most notably for borax mining. When mining prospects went sour, the Pacific Coast Borax Company lobbied for federal protection of Death Valley, in order to develop tourism. President Hoover declared about two million acres of the area a national monument in 1933. In 1994 the monument was expanded by 1.3 million acres and declared a national park.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:BadwaterBasin.JPG"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Badwater Basin, lowest point in North America"]]},"\n\nDeath Valley National Park is the lowest point in North America and one of the hottest places in the world. It is also a vast geological museum, containing examples of most of the earth's geological eras. Death Valley National Park includes all of Death Valley, a 130-mile-long north\/south-trending trough that formed between two major block-faulted mountain ranges: the Amargosa Range on the east and the Panamint Range on the west. Telescope Peak, the highest peak in the Park and in the Panamint Mountains, rises 11,049 feet above sea level and lies only 15 miles from the lowest point in the United States in the Badwater Basin salt pan, 282 feet below sea level. The California Desert Protection Act added most of the Saline, Eureka, northern Panamint, and Greenwater valleys to the Park.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\nAnimal life is varied, and numerous species of reptiles, birds and  mammals populate Death Valley, adapting well to the desert environment. However, many of these animals have a nocturnal lifestyle in order to escape the searing climate and can be difficult to spot.\n\nThe largest native mammal in the area, and perhaps the best studied member of the fauna, is the desert bighorn sheep. Small herds of sheep are most commonly found in the mountains surrounding Death Valley but at least occasionally visit the valley floor. Look for these animals near the springs and seeps that can be found throughout the park.\n\nOver 350 species of birds are now known to inhabit or visit the area. And even native fish are to be found in Death Valley - several forms of desert pupfish of the genus Cyprinodon live in Salt Creek and other permanent bodies of water.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nDeath Valley is one of the hottest places in the world. Air temperatures over 120 °F (49 °C) are common during the summer months of June, July, August and September. The hottest recorded temperature in the world was measured in the park in 1913 at a blazing 134 °F (57 °C) (a measurement of 136 °F recorded in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Libya"]]}," in 1922 has since been dismissed due to questions over its accuracy). Since it is often up to four degrees hotter near Badwater than it is near Furnace Creek where the official record was recorded, it is entirely likely that Death Valley should hold the title as the hottest place on Earth.\n\nFortunately, temperatures from November through March are mild with highs averaging in the 60s and 70s (15-25) with winter nighttime lows usually in the 40s (5-10). This makes the winter and early spring the best seasons to visit.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Death Valley-Sandstone.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Sun-baked sand in Death Valley"]]},"\n\nVery little rain falls in the valley, but rainfall in the mountains often sends floodwaters roaring down narrow canyons, scouring boulders, rocks and soil along the way and eventually depositing them in the valley. These deposits are evident in the form of gigantic Alluvial fans seen throughout the valley. Many of these fans reach over a mile wide and are the product of hundreds and thousands of years of this process.  The granular structure of these fans is also interesting to note as you will commonly see the larger boulders near the top of these structures and as you go further and further down, the granularity becomes finer and finer until you are finally left with the salts on the valley floor!\n\nThe higher elevations of the Panamint Range reach up to 11,049 feet (3,368 m) at Telescope Peak and are usually covered with snow from November to May, making a breathtaking backdrop to this unique desert climate.\n\nA land of extremes and superlatives, there are locations within the park that allow the visitor to see both the lowest and highest elevations in the 48 contiguous United States on a clear day. As far as US phenomena occur, not only does it feature the hottest recorded temperature, but also reports the lowest annual precipitation, the tallest sand dunes, and at 13,628 square kilometers, is the largest National Park in the 48 contiguous United States.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.mccarran.com\/ McCarran International Airport"]}]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["LAS"]]},") in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Las Vegas"]]}," is the closest commercial airport to Death Valley.\n\nThere are also three small airstrips within the park for private plane access at Stovepipe Wells, Furnace Creek, and Saline Valley.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nThe nearest city with an Amtrak station is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Barstow"]]},", which is served by the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.amtrak.com\/southwest-chief-train Southwest Chief"]}]}," Chicago - Los Angeles route.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["cautionbox"],["1=Some roads in the park can occasionally be snowed in at the passes and may require chains in the winter.

Note that most weather forecasts for the park refer to locations within the low altitude portion of the park and weather conditions at higher elevations can be dramatically different.\n\nThe paved roads within the park are well-maintained and accessible to vehicles of all kind, but dirt roads (with the exception of the west side around the Badwater Salt Flats) are rough.  Many use a vehicle with moderately high clearance such as a four-wheel drive, but a 4 wheel drive is not essential to visit any of the main sights listed below (except Echo Canyon). Expect excessive washboarding, erosion, large rocks, and uneven surfaces when traveling on the park's dirt roads.\n\nWhile well maintained paved roads traverse the park from east to west and to the south, most park features other than the visitor center will require some degree of off road travel.  In most cases, this will consist of graded dirt\/gravel roads.  This should not be a problem for a sensibly driven SUV but all drivers should exercise caution: don't leave Furnace Creek without a full tank of gas, make sure your space tire is serviceable, carry enough water for all passengers to last at least 24 hours (1 qt. per person minimum), don't rely on a cell phone in an emergency, carry a detailed park map and know how to read it.  There is likely no other place in the lower 48 states were a traveler could so easily fall off the beaten path than in Death Valley.  This advice is not meant to scare you but to remind you that overland travel in the park is serious business.  The best way to travel in the park and to see the most is a with a high clearance 4x4.  This designation is used throughout the park maps to describe what vehicles should or could attempt certain routes.  Only short sections of some routes might be classified as hard core but what makes the park so challenging is the length of some of the roads.  Most tours into remote ares require at least an eight hour commitment if starting from Furnace Creek, plan accordingly.  Before planning any driving off of the paved roads check with the visitor center or the park website for the latest road condition updates.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Death Valley and Furnace Creek"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Artist Drive"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat=36.36352"],["long=-116.80552"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=The rocks within this section of the park have been stained myriad colors by minerals within, creating a view that resembles an artist's palette."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Badwater"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat=36.22977"],["long=-116.76703"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=At 282 feet below sea level, it's the lowest point in North America.
