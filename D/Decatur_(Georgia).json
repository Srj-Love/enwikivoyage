This historic city was founded in 1823 - before neighboring Atlanta. It has beautiful homes, historic  places of worship and several institutions of higher learning.  Centered on the historic Decatur Courthouse, Decatur has become a hot destination for college students and young professionals who want hip bars, great restaurants, and walkable neighborhoods, as well as for families who are drawn to the excellent independent school district. In addition to the single-family homes in old neighborhoods surrounding the central business district, in recent years there have been several mid-rise condominium developments in the downtown area, breathing new life into the downtown community.  \n\nWhile it may appear to be a typical southern city, Decatur marches to the beat of a different drummer. It declined to become a railroad transportation hub for the southeast in the 19th Century, resulting in the founding of Atlanta to its west. Both delegates from DeKalb County voted against secession in 1861.  Decatur is one of the few parts of the sprawling Atlanta area that blends a small-town feel with an open-minded, freewheeling, artsy sensibility. \n\nDecatur remains notable for its diversity.  Founded by Scotch\/Irish\/English immigrants, the city remains majority Caucasian, but there is also a substantial African-American population, a lesbian community and recent Ethiopian immigrants.  North of the city is a Greek-American community, and northeast of the city (around Church St., Scott Blvd.\/Lawrenceville Hwy. and DeKalb Industrial Blvd.) is a thriving Indian community with restaurants and retail outlets. \n\nDecatur is also notable for its location.  Atlanta and Decatur are Georgia's only county seats inside the \"Perimeter\" interstate (I-285) that encircles the metro area.  Atlanta is an international city with corporate headquarters, world class convention facilities and a fast pace, while Decatur has retained a small city feel and a slightly slower pace.  Decatur is surrounded by the city of Atlanta on its south and west sides. It is closer to Atlanta's business, retail and cultural destinations than many Atlanta neighborhoods, and is easily mistaken for an intown neighborhood of Atlanta.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Read"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Clarke, Caroline McKinney.
