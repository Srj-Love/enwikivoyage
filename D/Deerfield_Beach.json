The city does experience cold fronts from November through March. However, the average monthly temperature for any month has never been recorded as being under 64.4 °F (January averages 66 °F). Most of the year is warm and humid, and the summers are almost identical to the climate of the Caribbean tropics. In addition, the city gets most of its rain in the summer (wet season) and is relatively dry in winter (dry season). The wet season, which is hot and humid, lasts from May to October, when it gives way to the dry season. The dry season features mild temperatures with some invasions of colder air, which is when the little winter rainfall occurs — with the passing of a front. \n\nThe hurricane season largely coincides with the wet season. 69% of the city's annual rainfall occurs during the five month summer period. The hurricane season is between 1 June and 30 November, with major hurricanes most likely to affect Florida in September and October. The most recent storms to directly affect the city were Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Wilma, both of which struck the city in 2005; other direct hits were Hurricane Cleo in 1964, Hurricane King in 1950 and the 1947 Fort Lauderdale Hurricane.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Train"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["AMTRAK"]}," offers daily train service on the Silver Star and Silver Meteor routes."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Quiet Waters Park"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Deerfield Beach Arboretum"]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nThe beach.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Casa Maya Grill"],["url=http:\/\/www.casamayagrill.com\/"],["email="],["address=301 S.E. 15th Terrace, Deerfield Beach FL USA, 33441"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone =+1 954  570-6101"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content= In \"The Cove\" strip mall, on Hillsboro Boulevard just west of the Intracoastal Bridge.
