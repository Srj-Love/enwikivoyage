At Lake Amistad, visitors can also find 4,000-year-old Indian pictographs, which are accessible only by boat at Panther Cave and at Parida Cave.\n\nVal Verde Winery ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.valverdewinery.com"]}," in the downtown area offers a wine-tasting of about a dozen of their wines for about $5 per person or a free tasting of only three. Their wines are excellent and range from sweet (notably the San Felipe del Rio red, their Texas Rose, and their Muscat Cannelli) to exceptionally dry (Cabernet Sauvignon), but their port has won awards. Most of their wines are blends with grapes from other vineyards, but one is made of only grapes grown at the winery.  \n\nKaraoke at Lorina's Cantina (see below) on Saturday nights.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nDel Rio has one, relatively small, indoor mall with typical mall stores: Beall's, Penney's, etc. and the town cinema with several screens.\n\nThe Adrian Falcon Gallery ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.adrianjfalcongallery.com"]}," offers contemporary art by Del Rio native Adrian Falcon.\n\nThe downtown area has numerous shops, including several antique shops and a few selling rustic furniture.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nLa Hacienda is a Mexican restaurant downtown that offers an excellent buffet of Mexican food for a very reasonable price.  One item not on the menu is \"cabrito\" (goat), which you have to ask for and it is excellent, succulent meat, beautifully roasted.  Each day the restaurant roasts one goat in the morning and sells it until it runs out. Get there early!  Their coffee is great and compares well to Starbuck's. \n\nLorina's Cantina, outside of town on US 90 toward the Lake, has steak night on Wednesdays from 6:00 to 8:00.  Call ahead to reserve a steak.  The steaks are about 3\/4 to 1 lb in size, thick cut, wonderful, beautifully seasoned, succulent, and come with a baked potato and salad (only lettuce and dressings) bar for only $13 per person.  This is a real meal for meat-and-potato-kind-of-guys.\n\nT&B (Todd and Bullet's) Bar and Grill next to the Day's Inn on US 90 has good food and a good bar.  Anthony Bourdain of the Travel Channel once came here for their Corona Chicken, which is succulent pieces of chicken about the size of the neck of a Corona bottle filled with cheese and wrapped in bacon. \n\nChinto's on Sixth street has excellent Mexican food and generous portions in a comfortable atmosphere for very resonable prices. Hours about 6AM to 2:30PM (per many traditional Mexican restaurants).\n\nStandard fast food (Wendy's, Whataburger, etc.) and chains (Chili's, Luby's, etc.) are available.\n\nThere is one Thai restaurant, Jitra's, in town with mediocre Thai food.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nLorina's Cantina and TB's are excellent places for relaxing evenings with a beer and friends.  TB's also offers excellent food seven nights a week, while Lorina's offers steaks on Wednesday nights from 6 to 8.\n\nFor a glass of wine in a quiet, comfortable atmosphere, Casa de Vino on US 90 near Lake Amistad (not far from Lorina's) is the place to go.  It offers about 300 different wines and a small appetizer menu in a comfortable, very clean setting. Casa de Vino also offers a small patio for watching the sun set on warm evenings.\n\nThe Herald Martini Bar is probably the classiest place in town and a good place to go for a nice dinner and drinks.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Best Western Inn of Del Rio"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/book.bestwestern.com\/bestwestern\/productInfo.do?propertyCode=44335"],["email="],["address=810 Avenue F."],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone =+1 830 775-7511"],["tollfree=+1-800-336-3537"],["fax=+1 830 774-2194"],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Motel 6"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.motel6.com\/reservations\/motel_detail.asp?MotelId=0323"],["email="],["address=2115 Veterans Boulevard"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone =+1 830 774-2115"],["tollfree="],["fax=+1 830 774-4878"],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Ramada Inn Del Rio"],["url=http:\/\/www.ramadainndelrio.com\/"],["email="],["address=2101 Veterans Blvd"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +1 830 775-1511"],["tollfree="],["fax=+1 830 775-1476"],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=Free high-speed wireless, heated outdoor pool, indoor fitness center."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Villa Del Rio"],["url=http:\/\/www.villadelrio.com\/"],["email=host@villadelrio.com"],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree=+1-800-995-1887"],["fax="],["hours="],["price=$95-$225"],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=Bed and breakfast in a historic mansion dating to 1887 during the boomtown days in Del Rio."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=La Quinta Inn"],["url="],["email="],["address=2005 Veterans Blvd"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +1 830 775-7591"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Whispering Palms Inn"],["url=http:\/\/http:\/\/www.whisperingpalmsinn.com\/"],["email="],["address=1300 Veterans Boulevard Del Rio, Texas"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +1 830 488-6270"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=$50"],["checkin=3PM"],["checkout=12PM"],["content=Brand new inn"]]}]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Consulates"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["Mexico"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Mexico"],["url="],["email="],["address=Edificio South Park Plaza 2398, Spur 239"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 830 775-2352"],["tollfree="],["fax=+1 956 723-1741"],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=US 90.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["directionl1=W"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Van Horn"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Marathon (Texas)"],["Marathon"]]}],["directionr1=E"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Antonio"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brackettville"]]}],["image2=US 277.svg"],["imagesize2=22"],["directionl2=N"],["majorl2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sonora (Texas)"],["Sonora"]]}],["minorl2=Loma Alta"],["directionr2=S"],["majorr2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Carrizo Springs"]]}],["minorr2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Eagle Pass"]]}],["image3=Texas Spur 239.svg"],["imagesize3=22"],["directionl3=S"],["majorl3=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ciudad Acuña"]]}],["minorl3=",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Aiga immigration.svg"],["18px"]]}],["directionr3=N"],["majorr3=END"],["minorr3="]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["South Texas Plains"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Geo"],["29.362"],["-100.896"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Related"],["Ciudad_Acu%c3%b1a"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Del Rio, Texas"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North_America\/United_States\/Texas\/Localities\/D\/Del_Rio"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Del Rio, Texas"]]}]
