The C&D Canal, which bisects the state two-thirds of the way up, serves as a sort of internal Mason-Dixon Line, separating the more urban and industrialized northern portion of Delaware, closely associated with the Northern metropolis of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Philadelphia"]]},", from the more rural \"slower, lower\" southern part, which is part of the Delmarva Peninsula and synchronized with the Southern rhythm of Maryland and Virginia.\n\nFittingly for a surprisingly diverse state, Delaware has a diverse economy, affecting the kinds of things available to visitors. The largest city, Wilmington, is a very business-oriented city; on account of Delaware's General Corporation Law, which is very favorable to managers of corporations, the majority of large US corporations are incorporated in the State of Delaware, and maintain a nominal presence in the state. Generally, this presence is in Wilmington, on account of its links to Philadelphia. This is especially true of banks, which also benefit from Delaware's laws respecting lending, and therefore maintain large workforces in Wilmington. Wilmington is therefore a very businesslike environment; most restaurants and bars downtown cater to those who work in Wilmington but live elsewhere (\"elsewhere\" often being Pennsylvania or even New Jersey).\n\nIn contrast to Wilmington, much of the state is essentially rural, and much of non-agricultural economy is tourism-based. The Delaware coastline is a relatively popular destination for people from the region to go for vacations during the summer. Moreover, Delaware has developed a strong tradition of craft brewing, with seven significant breweries in the state.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"''","value":["You might be from Delaware if you once thought that you might have a White Christmas... and then it rained."]},"\n\nThe weather in Delaware varies greatly from season to season.

Winters can get bitterly cold, although it rarely snows heavily. Spring and fall are generally the nicest seasons, although snow storms can arrive in April, and heat waves can hit in late November.  Delaware weather is unpredictable, the only real way to prepare would be to carry an umbrella and pray for sunshine.

The Deer Park (also on Main Street) is a long standing Newark institution with a rich history.  Although the current building dates from 1847, there has been a tavern on the site since colonial times.  Edgar Allan Poe once stayed at the St. Patrick's Inn, which formerly stood on the same site.  Legend has it that he put a curse on the building and the city after falling in the mud outside the hotel.  Due to the site's association with Poe, the symbol of the Deer Park is a raven, and there is a wooden raven on display in the main dining room.\n\nIn the city of Wilmington, Trolley Square, about one mile from downtown along Delaware Avenue, is widely popular with locals in their 20s-30s.  Among the bars in Trolley Square, The Logan House is arguably the most popular drinking location.
