Pizzas are offered in either 8 inch or 12 inch sizes, and come on either the traditional white wheat crust or a whole wheat crust.  You can make your own pizzas (up to 5 toppings for 6 bucks) or choose from their extensive menu of pre-planned pies.

The store shares a wall with the neighboring gallery, the \"(Not) On the Corner Framing and Gallery Shop\", and as such artwork is often on display in the store from the gallery.  Leather couches and a full-service coffee bar (roasting Stauff's Coffee, an Ohio specialty) add great touches to the store's atmosphere.  Sandwiches and desserts from the now-defunct Avesta's Eclectic Cuisine are for sale in the cooler up front, together with things like gourmet chocolates (try the chili pepper chocolate), Jone's Sodas, locally produced honey, and more.

Their ice cream selection rotates occasionally.  Adjacent to the ice cream parlor is a cute little seating area, with tables, antiques, and wireless internet.
