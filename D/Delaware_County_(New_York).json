Outdoor enthusiasts in particular will find much to sample and return to later—with most of the county's wildlands outside of the Catskill Park, hunting is more accessible. Trout fishermen take to their boats in Cannonsville and Pepacton reservoirs, and their waders in the East and West branches below them, sometimes even daring the Delaware's main stem below Hancock. Mountain bikers, skiers and hikers can find less beaten paths in various corners of this quiet yet welcoming county. And for those who'd prefer something less strenuous but equally rewarding, the village shopping districts remain largely untouched by time.\n\nDelaware County is the Catskills for those who really do want to get away from it all.
