This means that this is a region that serves as a bedroom community for those who work in Philadelphia and hence commute there.  Moreover locals in this part of the state get their local television and radio from Philadelphia, as well as root for major sports teams based there.\n\nThe Mercer county area, which contains the state capital Trenton however is mixed between New York and Philadelphia media which means that locals get television and radio from both markets and it's also common to see sports fans from both areas converge side-by-side in this county.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nJust as in other areas of the state, New Jersey Transit provides commuter rail and bus service within the region.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Itineraries"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nIf traveling to Camden, stay close to the Rutgers-Camden and Riverfront areas, especially at night.

Take extra caution driving.
