Sites throughout the valley hosted battles between the British and colonial Americans during the Revolutionary War and Philadelphia itself saw the writing of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States of America. Philadelphia today is the center of the region with 6.2 million people living within its boundaries. Neighboring Camden, rated the most dangerous city in America, was once an industrial center and today is revitalizing its downtown and waterfront with attractions like a concert arena and an exotic aquarium. Wilmington, DE to the south is the largest city in Delaware and is one of the most important banking cities in the United States.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nDialect in the Delaware Valley sounds much like its New York City counterpart to the north. Many r's are dropped. In Philadelphia, \"water\" is pronounced as \"wooder\" or \"whudder.\" Words like \"kawfee\" and \"hawt\" with an exaggerated \"o\" sound have been borrowed by denizens of the New York City area. \"Hoagies\" refer to sub sandwiches and \"steak\" may refer to the cheesesteak sandwich.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Plane"]},"\nThe major airport in the Delaware Valley with scheduled service to most major cities, and certain international destinations is ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.phl.org Philadelphia International Airport"]}]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["PHL"]]},")\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Car"]},"\nThe Delaware Valley is serviced by several interstates including the Pennsylvania Turnpike, Interstate 95, Interstate 76, the Schuylkill Expressway, the New Jersey Turnpike, and the Garden State Parkway.\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Train"]},"\nAmtrak",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.amtrak.com\/"]}," trains stop at ",{"type":"'''","value":["30th Street Station"]}," in Philadelphia, with regular fast commuter service to major points along the east coast such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New York City"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Washington, D.C."]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boston"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Baltimore"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nThe Delaware Valley is extensively served by both the national rail company Amtrak and the Southeast Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA). The main rail station in Philadelphia is 30th Street Station. SEPTA commuter rail extends to Marcus Hook, DE and Trenton, NJ. Southern New Jersey is also served by the Delaware River Port Authority's PATCO Hi-Speedline which is a hybrid subway and above-ground system.\n\nTaxis can be hailed in the major cities in the Delaware Valley including Philadelphia and Wilmington. For those adventurous enough to drive in these two large, car-congested cities, parking is scarce and roads can be hectic. Defensive driving is one's best bet in Philadelphia and Wilmington, as drivers are known to be both vocal and ruthless.\n\nIn Philadelphia, two subway lines and a subway-surface line cover the city. The Broad Street Line runs north-south and the Market-Frankford Line runs east-west. The subway-surface line parallels the MFL and makes stops at smaller stations than the subway of the same direction.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["National Historical Park"]}," Located in Philadelphia's historic district, the park contains the Liberty Bell, Independence Hall, Constitution Hall, the Declaration of Indepdendence, the Constitution, and a revitalized Franklin Square complete with historic carousel and mini golf course."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["New Jersey State Aquarium"]}," Located in Camden, NJ, just across the Delaware River from Philadelphia, the NJ State Aquarium is home to various exotic species of aquatic animal life."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Valley Forge"]]}]}," Located approximately 20 miles northwest of Philadelphia, it contains Valley Forge National Historical Park which was the site of the camp of the Continental Army from 1777-1778 and is today both a historical monument and a recreational area with various cultural activities."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["King of Prussia Mall"]}," The largest shopping mall in the United States, located about 15 miles northwest of Philadelphia.
