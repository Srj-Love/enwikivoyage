These ",{"type":"''","value":["grachten"]}," are still the pride of Delft.\n\nIn 1246 Delft received city rights, granted by Holland's Duke William II. Delft grew prosperous and new neighbourhoods were added to the city. In 1355 it reached the size it would remain at until the 1900s.\n\nIn 1536 a great fire destroyed 2300 houses. The most likely cause was lightning striking the tower of The New Church. About 100 years later, in 1654, an  explosion destroyed large parts of town; a warehouse with 36 000 kg of gunpowder blew up. A new warehouse (Kruithuis) was later built, outside the city perimeter.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:nieuwe-kerk.jpg"],["thumb"],["Nieuwe Kerk"]]},"Delft has long been a centre of art and science. With the foundation of the Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (East India Company) in 1602, Delft also became a trading center. The VOC was at one time the largest trading company in the world, with a huge fleet and offices all over Asia. One of the Dutch offices was in Delft.\n\nIn 1842, the Royal Academy for Civil Engineering (Koninklijke Academie ter opleiding van Burgerlijke Ingenieurs) was founded.

The locals are zooming around going about on their daily business.The locals are usually aware of tourists looking up at the gables and are ready for unsuspended side steps, but do try to keep an eye on the traffic.

The parking policy differs per area and is not always clear. Beware of the signs \"alleen vergunninghouders\" (",{"type":"''","value":["permit holders only"]},") in some streets in the vicinity of the city center, especially in residential areas.

Unauthorized parking will cost you about €70. A 10 minute walk from the centre parking for free can be found at the Nijverheidsplein. The University area will have space in the weekends.\n\nTraffic rules on priority consider the vulnerability of the mode of transport. This means a car has to give way to a bike to avoid a collision. Even a bike travelling the wrong way up a one-way street, without lights, driven by someone clearly over the limit colliding with a car will put that car driver at fault. Because of the risk to the cyclist, the car should have done everything to avoid the collision, or he is at fault.\n\nBe sure to check the mirrors before you make a right turn.
