Chauhan's ancestors are said to have captured the city from the Tomar Rajputs who were credited with founding Delhi.

After Ghori's death in 1206, Aibak proclaimed himself the ruler of Delhi and founded the slave dynasty. Qutb-ud-din contributed significantly in terms of architecture by getting Mehrauli built. His most prominent contribution is the starting of Qutab Minar. This 72.5 m tall tower was built across three generations and finally completed in 1220AD. A visitor to the Qutab Minar could also see the mausoleum of Kaki, Shamsi Talao and some other mosques.

This pillar was originally planted in Meerut by Samrat Ashok.Feroze Shah, also repaired many of the older construction in Delhi including Ghori's tomb, Qutub Minar,Suraj Kund and Hauz Khas. He, himself, was buried inside a lofty tomb in Hauz Khas. Quite like earlier, after Feroze Shah's death, the sultnate became unstable and weak, and was invaded by Taimur the Lame (from Samarkhand) who created havoc in the city by looting, killing, raping and plundering. The Sayyids and Lodhis who ruled Delhi after the Tughlaq's paid more attention to re-establishing miltiary and political stability to the kingdom. The only relevant architecture visible from this period are the tombs at Lodhi Gardens. The last of the Lodhi's was defeated by Babur in the first battle of Panipat.

On the west bank is the crowded and congested Old (Central) Delhi and, to the southwest, the broad, tree-lined avenues of New Delhi, built by the British to rule their empire. The rest is an endless low-rise sprawl of suburbia and slums, with southwestern Delhi (nearer to New Delhi) generally somewhat wealthier.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["New Delhi"]},"\nNew Delhi, or the central part of what is now called the National Capital Territory of Delhi, is the British built capital of India. Characterized by its wide boulevards, many traffic circles, colonial mansions, and government buildings dotted with monuments from various parts of India's history, this is the heart of the capital. Amongst the many popular tourist attractions located here are Humayun's Tomb, Purana Qila and the Lodhi gardens and tombs. Connaught Place (now called Rajiv Chowk) and Khan Market are popular shopping centres and the nearby Paharganj area has many inexpensive hotels. New Delhi Railway Station and Nizamuddin Railway Stations for trains to the south and east are in New Delhi. Delhi Metro lines radiate out from the city centre so the area is well connected.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["South Delhi"]},"\nSouth Delhi contains the upmarket neighbourhoods of Delhi and has a high concentration of five star hotels, numerous smaller hotels and guest houses, shopping malls and markets, and restaurants. It is also the most accessible from the airport and, with numerous overpasses constructed for the 2011 relatively easy to get around by car or taxi. The area is served by three metro lines: the violet line, the yellow line, and the airport express.

The hot season, April through June, is uncomfortably hot with soaring temperatures (going as high as 45°C\/110°F).

While the terminals share the same runways, connecting between the two requires a massive detour via a nearby highway (almost 10 km ride), so allow plenty of time to connect (at least 20 min). \n\nThere are ",{"type":"'''","value":["public buses"]}," to and from the city throughout the day and night. Travel time is approximately 50 min. They can be very crowded. There are two bus companies: Delhi Transport Corporation (green-yellow buses) and EATS (white-blue buses). The EATS (Ex Serviceman's Airlink Transport Service) Buses run to ISBT (Inter State Bus Terminal) near Kashmiri Gate, Connaught Place, Delhi Train Station and many hotels in the city centre, departing from both airport terminals every 60 min from 10AM-11:10PM. The Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) (schedule: ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.delhi.gov.in\/wps\/wcm\/connect\/DOIT_DTC\/dtc\/all+services\/special+services+of+delhi+ncr+to+igi+airport"]},") offers eight bus routes to both the city centre and the more outlying areas of Delhi. Tickets can be bought and a fixed seat can be booked at a desk in the Arrivals Hall. One way fare for both companies: ₹50 per adult, ₹25 per child below 12 years, ₹25 for heavy luggage.\n\nIf you'd prefer to go directly to your destination and are willing to sit around in traffic, or are arriving on the many long-distance flights that land in the dead of night, take a ",{"type":"'''","value":["taxi"]},". The easiest and safest way is to arrange transport ",{"type":"''","value":["ahead of time"]}," through your hotel (some hotels provide this service for free). Alternatively, you can pay for a taxi at the prepaid taxi booths in the international terminal. Prefer the pre-paid booth run by Delhi Police. Depending on the destination, they will ask you to pay the taxi fare to them, which they later pay to the taxi driver after he shows a receipt from you proving that you were taken to your destination. The pre-paid booths are visible as soon as you exit customs. The one on the left is managed by the Delhi police. You may be approached by touts offering pre-paid taxis; just ignore them and ask someone the direction to the Delhi Police prepaid taxi kiosk or booth managed by the cops. To the right of the exit door are private taxi operators. They are more expensive but the cars are air-conditioned. The number of the taxi assigned to you will be on the receipt. Then, go straight through the airport and turn right immediately outside the front doors and someone will help you find your taxi. There are several options, but the booth operated by the \"Delhi Police\" is considered the best, with non-A\/C taxis to most points in the city for ₹200-300.\n\nDo ",{"type":"'''","value":["not"]}," give the receipt to the driver until you get to the destination as this is what they are paid on. Also, ignore the explanation of the driver for additional payment. There is no practice of tipping taxi drivers anywhere in India. When you reach your destination, take your baggage first, then give the driver the receipt and walk away without further discussion.\n\nThere is a minor problem with this system. As there is a checkpoint manned by the traffic police just as your taxi moves away from the airport, you will have to give the receipt to the driver, who will hand it over to the police, who will record the taxi number. Make sure that you get the receipt back from the driver immediately, and return it only after you have safely reached your destination.\n\nWhen leaving Delhi from the international terminal, you should show up three hours before your flight is scheduled as security is tight. For domestic flights two hours should be enough. While sometimes time-consuming, the process is smooth, and the new terminal's shops and restaurants are sensibly located at the gate area, not before security. However, if you wish to change Rupees back into foreign currency, you must do this before clearing security.\n\nDuring the winter (Dec-Jan), Delhi often experiences ",{"type":"'''","value":["dense fog"]}," and visibility is reduced considerably, making it difficult for flights to land and take off.

Trains run every 20 minutes between 5AM and 11PM. The one-way fare between the airport and New Delhi Station is ₹150.

If you happen to be traveling in or out of Delhi during the winters, be aware of fog-related flight delays.\n\nDrink only packaged bottled water so you may avoid any water-related illness.

It is not uncommon to receive lewd remarks or even physical touching.  If you are arriving into Delhi at night either stay in the airport lounge or well lit areas until daybreak.  Try to avoid walking around alone or hiring cabs alone. Dress conservatively (preferably in Indian clothing so as to blend in). Learn to shout and consider carrying mace\/pepper spray.\n\nCarry your cash, passport, and cards in a secure money belt, with only enough cash for a few hours at a time in your wallet or other accessible place.  Some travelers recommend carrying an expendable wallet with a few ten rupee notes in it in an obvious place such as your hip pocket as a decoy to Delhi's ubiquitous pickpockets.\n\nSeveral tourist agencies have been known to swindle tourists, such as change their travel plans or  charge them extra commissions and fees.
