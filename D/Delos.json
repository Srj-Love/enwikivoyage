The first signs of habitation on the island date from the 3rd millennium B.C., and important remains of the Mycenaean period have been uncovered in the area of the sanctuary. In the 7th century B.C. Delos was already a known Ionic centre because of its religious importance as the birthplace of Apollo.  The Delos archaeological sanctuary is listed by ",{"type":"[[","value":[["UNESCO"]]}," as one of mankind's most important cultural and historical sites.\n\nA narrow channel separates Delos from the island of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Rhenia"]},", where there is an important burial ground.\n\nThe Cyclades received their name in antiquity because they form a rough circle (κύκλος\/",{"type":"''","value":["kyklos"]}," in Greek) round the sacred island of Delos.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThere are daily boat excursions from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mykonos"]]}," except Monday, because the archaeological site is closed that day.\nBoats leave at 9AM, 10AM and 11AM from the pier at the west side of the harbour, right behind the little church of Agios Nikolaos. The boat trip takes about 30 minutes. Boats return at 12:15PM, 1:30PM and 3PM. Boat trips to Delos are also organized from Platys Gialos and Paranga Beach. The excavations are open from 8:30AM to 3PM, so have an early start if you really want to see it all. The cost is €17 for the boat trip plus €5 for entrance (though free for students and €3 for those over 65). A guided tour, departing at 10AM from the pier in Mykonos, will cost € 40 (including boat trip and entrance fee).\n\nThe Cyclades are notoriously windy. As the boats going from Mykonos are relatively small, boat trips can be cancelled due to strong wind.\n\nIn summer routes are also available from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tinos"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Naxos"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Paros"]]},".\n\nOnly some small cruise ships dock at the commercial Delos port of call.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nYou will get a good map with different coloured tours.
