In ancient times it was the site of the most important oracle of the god Apollo. Delphi was revered throughout the Greek world as the site of the ομφαλός (omphalos) stone, the centre of the universe. In the inner ἑστία (hestia), or hearth, of the Temple of Delphic Apollo, an άσβεστος φλόγα (eternal flame) burned. After the battle of Plataea, the Greek cities extinguished their fires and brought new fire from the hearth of Greece, at Delphi; in the foundation stories of several Greek colonies, the founding colonists were first dedicated at Delphi.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["From Athens"]},"\n\nThere are several companies offering day trips from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Athens"]]}," to Delphi, prices varying from €80 to €100.
