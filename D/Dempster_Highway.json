The highway runs 671 kilometers (417mi.) from the Klondike Highway near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dawson City"]]}," to the Amerindian settlement of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Inuvik"]]},", extending an additional 194km (124mi) to Tuktoyatuk during winter months as an 'ice road'—where ice on lakes & river crossings is thick enough to safely traverse by vehicles. The road is one of just two roads in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North America"]]}," to cross the Arctic Circle. Although considerably less traveled than its American twin, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alaska"]]},"'s ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dalton Highway"]]},", the road offers much similar scenery.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThe Dempster Highway—Canada’s only all-weather road to cross the Arctic Circle—was officially opened on 18 August 1979, at Flat Creek, Yukon. It was unveiled as a two-lane, gravel-surfaced, all-weather highway that ran 671 km (417 mi) from the Klondike Highway near Dawson City to Fort McPherson and Arctic Red River (now Tsiigehtchic) in the Northwest Territories. The Canadian Forces 1 Combat Engineer Regiment from Chilliwack, British Columbia, built the two major bridges over the Ogilvie and Eagle rivers. Ferries handle the traffic at the Peel River crossing near Fort McPherson and the Arctic Red River crossing near Tsiigehtchic.\n\nThe design of the highway is unique, primarily due to the intense physical conditions it is put through. The highway itself sits on top of a gravel berm to insulate the permafrost in the soil underneath. The thickness of the gravel pad ranges from 1.2 m (3 ft 11 in) up to 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in) in some places. Without the pad, the permafrost would thaw and the road would sink into the ground.\n\nIn addition to services in Fort McPherson, Tsiigehtchic and Inuvik, there is one location with commercial services along the highway, at Eagle Plains. It is an important fuel and food stop because of the great distance, and harbours stranded travelers when the highway is closed due to extreme weather conditions. (Until 1979, the highway was only open in the short summer.)\n\nDuring the early 1990s, Northwestel erected microwave towers along the highway to facilitate public safety with manual mobile telephone service and to provide government agencies such as highway maintenance and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police with communications.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nMuch of the highway follows an old dog sled trail. The highway is named after Royal Canadian Mounted Police Inspector William John Duncan Dempster, who, as a young constable, frequently ran the dog sled trail from Dawson City to Fort McPherson NWT. Inspector Dempster and two other constables were sent out on a rescue patrol in March 1911, to find Inspector Francis Joseph Fitzgerald and his men of three who never made it to Dawson City. They had become lost on the trail, and subsequently died of exposure and starvation. Dempster and his men found the bodies on March 22, 1911.[1]\n\nIn 1958 the Canadian government made the historic decision to build a 671 km (417 mi) road through the Arctic wilderness from Dawson City to Inuvik. Oil and gas exploration was booming in the Mackenzie Delta and the town of Inuvik was under construction. The road was billed as the first-ever overland supply link to southern Canada, where business and political circles buzzed with talk of an oil pipeline that would run parallel to the road. The two would ultimately connect with another proposed pipeline along the Alaska Highway.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Prepare"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:NWT mud road.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Muddy gravel section of the highway."]]},"\n",{"type":"''","value":["See also: ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tips for road trips"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Winter driving"]]},"."]},"\n\nThe Dempster Highway has very little services and shops along its length and those services & goods which are available are quite expensive.
