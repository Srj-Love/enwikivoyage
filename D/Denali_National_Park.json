Today the park is managed as three separate units: ",{"type":"'''","value":["Denali Wilderness"]}," is made up of the original Mount McKinley National Park and is managed to retain the undeveloped wilderness with no hunting allowed.

Permafrost ground underlies many areas of the park, where only a thin layer of topsoil is available to support life.  After the continental glaciers retreated from most of the park 10,000 to 14,000 years ago, hundreds of years were required to begin building new soils and re-vegetation.  The dynamic glaciated landscape provides large rivers, countless lakes and ponds, and unique landforms which form the foundation of the ecosystems that thrive Denali\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:32-denali-dall-sheep-above-savage-river.jpg"],["thumb"],["270px"],["Dall sheep near Savage River"]]},"\n\nThe terrain of Denali includes \"tundra\" and \"taiga\" zones.  Taiga zones are made up of the stubby evergreen, spruce and aspen trees that are found in areas around the Arctic Circle.  The taiga zone within Denali extends to approximately 2700 feet (823 m) above sea level, above which few trees are found.  The treeless areas of the park can generally be classified as tundra.  Within a tundra zone the plants are often miniaturized, including tiny flowers, extensive mosses, and various shrubs.  Be aware of the willow thickets in the tundra zone as they can be a major impediment while hiking.\n\nCongress created the park to protect its abundance of large mammals.  Today it is common to see grizzly bears, caribou, Dall sheep, moose, and foxes throughout the park.  Less common but still regularly seen are the park's many wolves.  Black bears are also occasionally seen, and the ",{"type":"''","value":["very"]}," lucky visitor might glimpse a wolverine.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nWeather in Denali is extremely variable, and changes occur without warning. Many rangers tell visitors to expect sun, wind, rain, and clouds, and expect them all on the same day. Average summer temperatures range from 33-75°F (1-24°C). It has been known to snow in July, so prepare by wearing layers of clothing that can be removed or added as needed, and carry a waterproof raincoat or jacket.\n\nWinters can be extremely cold with temperatures ranging from -40°F (-40°C) and below to high 20s (-2°C) on warm days. Specialized cold weather gear is necessary for mountaineering and winter visits. For more information on winter visits contact park headquarters at +1 907 683-2294.\n\nThe mountain is at least partially shrouded in cloud during most of the summer.

Trains depart from both Anchorage and Fairbanks at 8:15AM, arriving at noon from Fairbanks and at 3:45PM from Anchorage.  Trains departing from the park arrive at 8:15PM in both Anchorage and Fairbanks.  Fares vary throughout the season, with rates between $43 and $54 for a one-way ticket from Fairbanks to Denali, and between $103 and $129 from Anchorage to Denali.

Several tour operators provide service during the summer.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\n\nIndividuals entering the park must pay a $10 fee, good for seven days.  A vehicle entrance fee is $20, also good for seven days.  Those with a Federal Lands Annual Pass ($80, allows entrance to all national park areas for one year), a Senior Pass, or an Access Pass (for people with disabilities) do not need to pay the entrance fee.\n\nFees can be confusing for this park.  First of all, there is no park entrance station.  As you begin to drive the Park Road, you are greeted by a gigantic sign that says \"Denali National Park,\" but you will not be stopped until the staffed gate at mile 15 which is the limit people can drive with their private vehicle.  If you drive up to that gate, you will simply be asked to turn around.\n\nFees within the first 15 miles of the park, while required, are done pretty much on the honor system.  If you stop in the visitor center and ask, \"Do I need to pay an entrance fee?\"  The answer is, \"Yes.\"  However, if you had kept driving, nobody will check to see if you've paid.\n\n\"How then,\" you may ask, \"does the park collect its entrance fees?\"  Well, if you buy a bus ticket (the only way to get on the park road past mile 15), or if you stay in a campground, you will automatically be charged an entrance fee.  And, since more than 90% of the visitors who enter Denali take a bus at one point or another, the situation is all gravy.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nThe main road through the park is open to automobile traffic only as far as Savage River (mile 14).  Travel beyond this point is allowed only on the park shuttle buses, on foot, or on a bicycle.\n\nFor people camping at Teklanika campground, one automobile per a campsite is allowed to drive in to it.\n\nFor those visiting Denali in mid-September the park service opens the road completely for four days after the shuttle buses stop running.  Only 400 vehicles per day are admitted, and each vehicle requires a special permit.  To potentially obtain one of these permits contact the park and inquire about the Denali Road Lottery.  The park service will ask you to mail your address, preference of dates, and a fee during the month of July.  In mid-August you will be contacted if you have been selected.  If snow has not yet closed the road, once the four-day lottery is complete the road will be opened to private vehicles for travel as far as Teklanika Campground (mile 29) until weather closes it for the season.  It is also important to note that the road may close during the road lottery if inclement weather shows up - much to the chagrin of all those people who won a permit only to have it canceled.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By shuttle bus"]},"\n\nShuttle buses are allowed past Savage River (mile 15) on the park road, as far as Kantishna (the end of the road).  Passengers may disembark from the buses at any point west of mile 20, and then re-board any bus on a space-available basis.  Anyone disembarking should be aware of the bus schedule, and plan for at least a one hour wait for a bus with seats available to arrive.\n\nA very common question people have about the buses is, \"So what's the difference between a shuttle bus and a tour bus.\"  Simply put, most of the people on tour buses are on packaged trips with the local hotels, and they get a dedicated naturalist on their bus that is required to give commentary throughout the tour.  Buying tickets for tours can be more difficult because the vast majority of the tickets are reserved when people book their packaged vacations.  However, they are not necessarily \"better\" than a shuttle bus.  Two important facts to note are that all the buses drive the same road (duh, there's only one road inside the park!), and that all the buses have similar destinations.  By similar destinations I mean that there's a tour bus to Eilson Visitor Center and there is also a shuttle bus to Eilson Visitor Center.  So, if you ask, \"Which bus is better for seeing wildlife?\"  The answer is that they are about the same since they are on the same road going to the same place.  Your experience on the shuttle bus happens to vary quite a bit depending on the driver you get.  Some of the shuttle bus drivers will talk just as much as a tour bus driver, however, they are not required to.  Some of the shuttle bus drivers won't say much of anything unless somebody asks them a question.  It's important to note that a pretty large majority of the bus drivers will give some form of commentary as they drive, because they want to share their love of the park just as much as all the other employees.  Oftentimes, a deciding factor for people on whether to take a shuttle or a tour to Eilson is, \"Do I want to pay about $30 for a shuttle bus or about $95 for a tour bus?\"  You be the judge.\n\nShuttle bus reservations can be made either by following the instructions at the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.reservedenali.com\/shuttles.aspx park concessionaire web site"]}," or in person at the reservation desk in the visitor center.

From a bridge over the river, one can see upstream towards the river's source along a \"u-shaped,\" glacier-carved valley and downstream along a small canyon, cut into the mountains by the river's passage.  Because of this, and a number of exposed rock formations, it is one of the most geologically interesting areas to explore.

Here, you will be required to provide some information about yourself, your gear and your backpacking experience and watch a safety video.

If you have to ford a stream be very careful, as the water will be very cold and the currents are almost always stronger than they look.  If you are pulled under there is a great danger of spraining or breaking bones, and hypothermia can set in if you can't quickly get out of wet clothes and into dry ones.
