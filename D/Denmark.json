Separated from the other Islands, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bornholm"]]}," lies by itself between Sweden and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Poland"]]}," in the Baltic sea.\n\nOnce the seat of Viking raiders and later a major north European power, Denmark has evolved into a modern, prosperous nation that is participating in the general political and economic integration of Europe. However, the country has opted out of European Union's Maastricht Treaty, the European monetary system (EMU), and issues concerning certain internal affairs.\n\nDenmark is also the birthplace of one of the world's most popular toys, LEGO. There is no better place in the world where one can buy Lego bricks than at the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.legoland.dk\/ legoland"]}," theme park in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Billund"]]},".\n\nThese days, the Danish Vikings have parked their ships in the garage and put the helmets on the shelves, and along with the other Scandinavian nations, have forged a society that is often seen as a benchmark of civilization; with progressive social policies, a commitment to free speech so strong it put the country at odds with much of the world during the 2006 cartoon crisis, a liberal social-welfare system and, according to The Economist, one of the most commercially competitive. Top it off with a rich, well-preserved  cultural heritage, and the Danes legendary sense of design and architecture, and you have one intriguing holiday destination.\n\nDubbed in various surveys and polls throughout the years as the \"Happiest country in the world\", it is often pictured as a romantic and safe place, likely linked to Hans Christian Andersen as a \"fairy tale\" on its own. Of course much more lies beneath the surface, but as a traveler, Denmark is likely to prove convenient, safe, clean, but also quite expensive to visit.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n:",{"type":"''","value":["\"My life is a lovely story, happy and full of incident.\""]}," ",{"type":"<","value":["small",["— Hans Christian Andersen"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Terrain"]},"\nDenmark is flat! More than 60% of the landmasses are flat, arable land, making it ideal for farming. And an additional 15% or so are similarly flat forests. Thus Denmark is home to the 'lowest-highest' point in Europe; at a stunning 170.86 meters above sea level, ",{"type":"''","value":["Møllehøj"]},", near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Skanderborg"]]},", was in 2005 confirmed as the highest natural point in Denmark. More famously ",{"type":"''","value":["Ejer Baunehøj"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["Yding Skovhøj"]}," with 170.35 and 170.77 meters respectively has been competing for years, until in 2005 with a new technique the winning hill could be found. Either way, the 216 meter tall ",{"type":"''","value":["Søsterhøj Transmission Tower"]}," near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Aarhus"]]}," stretches reaches 315 meter above sea level and thus is technically the highest point in Denmark.\n\nThe almost 7,500 km coastline makes room for a large number of beaches, which along with the wind erosion, and plenty of rain, have formed the landscape, and today it is a country of small hills and valleys, minor lakes and small forests with beach and pine. The geographic position of Denmark on the tectonic plates have reduced the risk of earthquakes and volcanoes, and the worst quakes in modern times have been measured to 4.7 on the Richter scale\n\nThe mountains in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sweden"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Norway"]]}," shield Denmark from most of the stormy weather and freezing winter air. Combined with the mild temperature and high degree of moisture in the winds blowing in from the North Sea it makes the land well suited for agriculture as the seasons are smoothed, and seldom creates droughts or floods.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bornholm"]]}," is one of the few exceptions to the overall farming friendly terrain, as the depth of the soil is reduced, and bedrock can be seen in multiple sites.\n\nThe west coast of Jutland facing the North Sea is slowly eroding, and accumulates the eroded soil due to the currents in the ocean. The result forms wide sandy beaches, whereas the east coast of Jutland in general is covered with pebble beaches.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Culture"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Sports"]}," are popular in Denmark, with soccer reigning supreme in popularity and counted as ",{"type":"''","value":["the"]}," national sport, followed by Gymnastics, Handball and Golf. Badminton and Water sports, however, often wins medals in international events like the Olympic Games.\n\nAnother trait of Danish culture as any tourist pamphlet will tell you, is \"",{"type":"'''","value":["Hygge"]},"\", translating into cosy or snug.  Danes themselves will be quick to point out this is somehow a unique Danish concept, which is hardly in tune with reality, but it does probably take a more prominent place in the culture than in many other countries.  It usually involves low key dinners in people's home, with long conversations over candlelight and red wine in the company of friends and family, but the word is broadly used for social interactions.\n\nAnother important aspect of Danish culture is ",{"type":"'''","value":["understatement"]}," and modesty, which is not only prominent in Danish behavioral patterns but also very much an important trait in the famous Danish design, which dictates strict minimalism and functionalism over flashiness, something that transfers well to the Danish people as well.\n\nThe Danes are a fiercely ",{"type":"'''","value":["patriotic"]}," bunch, but in a sneakingly low-key kind of way. They will warmly welcome visitors to show off the country, which they are rightly proud of, but any criticism - however constructive - will not be taken lightly, although most Danes will happily spend hours to prove you wrong over a Carlsberg beer, rather than becoming hostile. It won't get you far though, and if you manage to convince anyone of any other flaws than the taxes are too high, the weather is too bad or other trivialities, you should immediately return home and run for political office. For the same reasons, outsiders on long term stays are by many viewed with a certain amount of suspicion. As the ",{"type":"'''","value":["homogeneous"]}," society is often thought to be the key to Denmark's successes, you will often hear resident foreigners complain about a constant pressure to become ever more Danish, and the anti-immigrant Danish Peoples Party have seen increasing popularity over the years, taking 13% of the votes at the latest election, making it Denmark's 3rd largest political party.\n\nAs a traveler it is therefore likely that Danes will be friendly and helpful towards you, but rarely engage in contact and conversations with you on their own initiative. Often the people can be seen as cold, skeptical and even a bit rude, but it is only on the surface. It can take time to truly befriend a Dane. If nothing else, hit any bar in town and you will be greeted warmly when the first few beers are put away.\n\nDrinking alcoholic beverages is, however strange it can seem, a key component in the social life there. Especially when comparing with the other Scandinavian countries, Denmark has a very liberal attitude to alcohol consumption, both in terms of what is socially and legally acceptable. For many social gatherings alcohol is a must (during weekends) and is seen a positive driver for loosening the atmosphere. Engaging in drinking is most likely the best way to get to know a Dane.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Environment "]},"\nDenmark is often praised as being the one of the greenest countries in the world, but apart from the ubiquitous bikes, the individual Danes are surprisingly nonchalant about the environment despite their reputation, and actually contribute as many greenhouse emissions as most other nationalities. As with so many other things, it is thought as a collective responsibility, and have safely been played into the hands of the government, which in turn, with great success under Social Democratic leadership, enacted a series of reforms, mainly ",{"type":"''","value":["green taxation"]},", between 1993-2001, that made Danish society as a whole (especially in industrial production) one of the most energy efficient in the world. As it turned out it was also good business, and green technology has become of the country's largest exports, including fields like thermostats, wind turbines and home insulation. Because of this, green policies enjoys unusually broad support among the people and the entire political spectrum. 20% of energy productions comes from renewable energy, mainly wind power, a feat mainly made possible by the common Nordic energy market and the massive hydro energy resources in Norway and Sweden, which can easily be regulated up and down to balance the unreliable wind production.\n\nAt the moment, the wind production in general produces more power during the night than the Danish companies can consume, while not producing enough in daytime to cover the consumption. In recent years, the installation of solar power in domestic houses has been supported by targeted tax reductions to create a secondary renewable energy source that is active during the days hours. As a backup the old coal and oil based power plants are kept ready for production, and black or brown outs are unthinkable for the Danish population.\n\nAll these lofty green visions do actually have a few tangible implications for travelers:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Plastic bags cost money; DKK 1-5 - non-refundable, so bring a bag for shopping groceries."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Cans and bottles have DKK 1-3 deposit, refundable any place that sells bottled drinks."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Many toilets have half and full flush buttons, now - you figure out when to use which."]},{"type":"*","value":[" There is a roughly 100% (DKK 4) tax on gasoline, the total price usually hovers between DKK 10-12 per litre.

When changing between lanes on motorways use of turn signals prior to- and during the lane change is mandatory.\n\nOn open roads, especially those with an accompanying cycle path, expect drivers turning right to come to an almost dead stop to check that they are not cutting in front of a cyclist, even if there is no way even an Olympic cyclist could appear from nowhere on an entirely cycle free horizon.\n\nRight turn on red is not permitted.\n\nDenmark allow drivers to have 0.05 percent alcohol in the bloodstream while driving (for most people this is  equivalent to having consumed one drink or less), and Danish police is very aware of possible drunken drivers.

Elsewhere in the country, many people prefer to avoid speaking it, even when they do have some command of the language, and you will have a hard time convincing anyone (outside the tourist industry) otherwise: this has nothing to do with history but is merely a result of the high fluency in English, making the locals less inclined to struggle through a language they are not entirely comfortable with. In a pinch or emergency though, people will probably step up, and do their best to help.  There is a native or indigenous German speaking minority along the southern border to Germany (Sønderjylland \/ Northern Schleswig). Vice versa, across the frontier, there is a small community of Danish speakers to be found in Germany.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["French"]}," is also spoken to some degree, as all Danish students have received at least three years of lessons in either German or French, but given the Danes' limited contact with the French language, fluency tends to be lagging.\n\nForeign television programmes and films are almost always shown in their original language with subtitles.

Freshwater fishing is a bit more complicated than coastal fishing in Denmark, however, as there is a host of local communities presiding over the rights to fish in the specific waters, usually in agreement with the land owners where the waters are situated if they aren't owned by the state, but that also means that some stretches of a specific stream or brook may be off-limits, due to the land owner's ownership. Regulations for seasons and sizes are mandated by the state, but prices and terms for permits are regulated by the communities. Local tourist offices are usually well informed and mostly allowed to sell permits, which may be daily, weekly, monthly or yearly.\n\nLastly, there is a significant number of \"Put-and-Take\" facilities that doesn't require a permit as such, but where you purchase the right to fish for a number of hours, but where the owner of the facility guarantees that there are fish present - usually Rainbow Trout - but whereas many facilities are \"self-serve\" in the sense that you fill out a form and dump it, and the corresponding payment, in a post box, don't be surprised if the proprietor comes by at some time to ask if you are in luck, at the same time keeping track of the number and times of the forms, hours and payments that he has collected from the box.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Hunting"]},"\nHunting in Denmark is done on the basis of land owners retaining the right to hunt on their premises and then, possibly renting it out to interested parties, keeping a close check on who hunts where and when.\n\nThus, whereas it is relevant to note that a general hunting permit (DKK 500,-) is required, hunting is almost exclusively done with people that you know, who have the hunting rights to the land in question, so if you want to go hunting in Denmark, you would most probably need to befriend a land owner or a friend of one beforehand.\n\nNote that Danish weapons legislation is extremely restrictive. Generally any type of weapon is illegal to own or carry anywhere! There are exceptions for hunting and weapons clubs, but this requires a special permit, and outside the shooting area (hunting grounds or club) the weapon must be concealed and not loaded. Many types of knives are also illegal. Weapon types which cannot be used for hunting or shooting contents - such as knuckles - are just outright illegal anytime and anywhere.

Traditional Danish fare includes items as pickled herring, fried plaice, and other assorted seafood items.  Hearty meat dishes are also prevalent, as seen in items such as frikadeller (pork only or pork and veal meat balls topped by a brown sauce) and \"stegt flæsk og persillesovs\" (thick fried pork bacon slices topped by a parsley cream sauce).  Many meals are also accompanied by a beer, and shots of aquavit or schnapps, though these are mainly enjoyed when guests are over. Drinking along with meals is encouraged as the foods are enhanced by the drinks, and vice versa. If looking for a quick snack to grab on the go, try the traditional Danish hot dog, served in a bun with a variety of fixings, including pickles, fried or raw onions as well as ketchup, mustard and remoulade (a Danish invention in spite of the French name, consisting of mayonnaise with the addition of chopped cabbage and turmeric for color). For dessert, try either \"ris á la mande\" (rice pudding with almonds and cherries, again a French name with no relation to French cuisine) or æbleskiver (ball-shaped cakes similar in texture to American pancakes, served with strawberry jam), both normally only available in November and December. For candy try a bag of \"Super Piratos\" (hot licorice candy with salmiakki).\n\nIn the past few years, Copenhagen has emerged as a very happening place for food enthusiasts and gastronomic travelers, the highlight being the world-renowned restaurant ",{"type":"''","value":["Noma"]},".\n\nDo avoid touristy places where no Danes are to be found, popularity among locals is almost always an indicator of quality.\n\nRestaurants offering examples of international cuisine are common, mostly in major cities, especially Italian, Greek and Chinese restaurants, though Japanese, Indian and even Ethiopian restaurants can be found too. Quality is generally high, as the competition is too sharp for low-quality businesses to survive.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Smørrebrød"]},"\nThe traditional Danish lunch is ",{"type":"'''","value":["smørrebrød"]},", open sandwiches usually on rye bread - fish except herring, plaice and mackerel are served on white bread, and many restaurants give you a choice of breads. Smørrebrød served on special occasions, in lunch restaurants, or bought in lunch takeaway stores, are piled higher than the daily fare.\nThe Danish rye bread (",{"type":"''","value":["rugbrød"]},") is dark, slightly sourish and often wholegrain. It is a must for all visitors to try.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nDanes are rightly famous for their good looks, but unlike most other places, their lucky draw at the gene pool hasn't translated into the self-assertion and confidence you normally see. And the Danes have become infamous for being closed and tight lipped, bordering the outright rude. So while it is by no means impossible, you will still be hard pressed to find a Dane readily engaging in casual conversations with strangers. That is, until you hit the country's bars and nightclubs.\n\nAs any foreigner who has spent time observing the Danes will tell you, alcohol is the fabric that holds Danish society together. And when they are off their face in the dead of night, they suddenly let their guard down, loosen up, and while a bit pitiful, they somehow transmorph into one of the most likable bunch of people on Earth. Rather than the violence associated with binge drinking elsewhere, because it seems to serve a very important social purpose, the natives get very open, friendly and loving instead. It takes some time getting used to, but if you want to form bonds with the Danes, this is how you do it - God help you if you are abstinent. This also means Danes have a very high tolerance for drunk behavior, provided it takes place in the weekends. Drink a glass or two of wine for dinner during the week, and you can be mistaken for an alcoholic, but down 20 pints on a Saturday night, and puke all over the place, and everything will be in order.\n\nThere is no legal drinking age in Denmark, although a legal purchase age of 16 is in effect in shops and supermarkets when under 16,5% alcohol, and 18 in bars, discos, restaurants and shops and supermarkets when over 16,5% alcohol. The enforcement of this limitation is somewhat lax in shops and supermarkets, but quite strict in bars and discos, as fines of up to DKK 10,000 and annulment of the license can incur on the vendor. The purchaser is never punished, although some discos enforce a voluntary zero-tolerance policy on underage drinking, where you can get kicked out if caught with no ID and an alcoholic beverage in your hand. Some would claim that the famous Danish tolerance towards underage drinking is waning in light of recent health campaigns targeting the consumption of alcoholic beverages among Danes. As adult Danes do not approve of the government interfering with their own drinking habits, the blame is shifted towards adolescents instead, and proposals of increasing the legal purchase age to 18 overall have been drafted, but have yet to pass Parliament, neither is it likely too in the foreseeable future.\n\nDrinking alcoholic beverages in public, including trains and buses, is considered socially acceptable in Denmark. Having a beer in a public square is a common warm weather activity, though local by-laws are increasingly curbing this liberty, as loitering alcoholics are regarded as bad for business. Drinking bans are usually signposted, but not universally obeyed and enforced. In any case, be sure to moderate your public drinking, especially during the daytime. Extreme loudness may in the worst case land you a few hours in jail for public rowdiness (no record will be kept, though). Most police officers will instead ask you to leave and go home, though.\n\nDanish beer is a treat for a ",{"type":"'''","value":["beer enthusiast"]},".  The largest brewery, Carlsberg (which also owns the Tuborg brand), offers a few choices, as well as a delicious \"Christmas beer\" in the 6 weeks leading up to the holidays.  Other tasty beverages include the Aquavit (Snaps) and Gløgg - a hot wine drink popular in December. Danish beer is mostly limited to lager beer (",{"type":"''","value":["pilsner"]},"), which are good, but not very diverse. However in the last few years Danes have become interested in a wider range of beers, and Danish microbreweries' excellent products are increasingly available.

The address format is:\n:<Name>\n:c\/o Poste restante\n:<Name of post office>\n:<Postal-Code> <City>\n:DENMARK\n\nA note on the above: When picking up the mail, you will need to identify yourself with a government issued photo-ID (i.e. passport or drivers license). Make sure that your name is spelled in the same way on the package and on the ID.\n\nMajor international parcel services like UPS, Fedex and DHL while present in Denmark, do not offer any holding service.

Many attribute this to the high equality not only being present in practice, but also mentally - \"you are not worth any more than me, so why should I treat you any different\". By and large it is just one of those cultural differences you have deal with while visiting another country, and throwing a hissy fit or demanding to speak to the supervisor is unlikely to get you anywhere. On the upside, tipping is neither expected nor required. When you ",{"type":"''","value":["do"]}," bump into good service, it tends to be truly genuine helpfulness, rather than an expectation for tips or employee training courses - so savour such moments, remember to tip, and forget about the rest.\n\nOn a practical level, this means that you should only expect table service in restaurants. In cafés and bars you usually order in the bar or counter and pay immediately when ordering, even if you intend for a second order. It is also common that staff doing other duties than serving customers will happily keep the customer waiting, until he or she is finished with whatever needs doing. Also don't expect any sirs or madams; verbal bromides seem awkward to most Danes, including those behind a counter.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Media "]},"\nApart from children's shows, nothing gets dubbed in Denmark although a sizeable portion of broadcasts in Denmark are American and British productions - so even with no English channels, there will usually be something on in a comprehensible language, same goes for cinemas - so you should be safe for a lazy rainy day.
