You'll find everything a cosmopolitan city has to offer including a spectacular view of and easy access to the beautiful Rocky Mountains, which are only 12 miles west of town.\n\nDenver does have its growing pains. Urban sprawl is becoming a problem, with the metropolitan area sometimes growing faster than the infrastructure can really handle, especially with public transportation.

About once a year, a snowfall of over a few feet occurs.  Winter is also when the Denver area gets pounded by a phenomenon known as the \"Chinook\". That's when air flows over the mountains to the west and sinks on the leeward (eastern) slopes of the foothills and warms up. This raises air temperatures dramatically, which can last for several days.  If you're planning to visit Denver during the winter, be prepared with full winter gear just in case, but also pack a light sweater and t-shirt; the weather is usually very sunny and mild.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Denver Lightning.jpg"],["thumbnail"],["Evening thunderstorms are common in late spring and fall"]]},"\n\nSpring in Denver is pleasant, though generally rather brief.  Trees begin budding by late March and are in full leaf by mid April to mid May.  March, on average, is Denver's snowiest month.\n\nBy June, Denver enters its summer season.  Temperatures typically rise in earnest at this time, with most heat waves beginning in mid-June and continuing through July, usually Denver's hottest month with temperatures in the high 80s to mid-90s.  By late July, the southwest monsoon kicks in. In August, short spells of thunderstorms occur about three to four days per week. By late August, temperatures begin to drop with a noticeable difference between day time and night time temperatures. As the days get shorter through September and October, daytime temperatures drop to the high 50s to mid-60s. Slather on that sunscreen all summer long; the rays are strong and the air is dry, with temperatures often reaching the upper 90s in July and August.\n\nAutumn is a peaceful time to visit, with mild temperatures, little severe weather and lots of that famous clear blue sky. You'll get to see the trees display their fall colors, which usually peak around mid-September in the mountains and October in the city itself. October usually brings the first snowfall of the season to Denver, although it's very light.

In the downtown area near Coors Field, The Pepsi Center, and LoDo, there is pretty much no free parking on weekdays. In some areas a few blocks from the city center there are a few non-metered spots within reasonable walking distance of downtown. However, just because you don't see a meter doesn't mean that parking is free. Denver is increasingly using \"European-style\" meters, where you purchase a paper ticket from a machine somewhere on the block and place it on your dashboard.  Also, many neighborhoods around downtown allow only permitted residents to park, so be sure to check the signs first.\n\nIt is worth noting that the city government has been cracking down on parking violations recently, so if you park at a meter with a flashing red light and don't pay, even for a few minutes, EXPECT TO GET A TICKET.  Meter violations will cost you a cool $25 ($50 if you don't pay up within two weeks).  Lack of change is no longer a problem, as all the meters in the downtown area are now equipped with credit card readers that accept Visa and MasterCard.  $1 will get you around an hour, depending on the location of the meter.\n\nAreas outside of the downtown core (20th St, Speer, Wynkoop St, Colfax and Broadway) usually have meters that end at 6PM and are free on weekends, so parking is much easier during those times.

Yet another light rail line connects downtown Denver to Englewood and Littleton.  Nearly all light rail lines get you to downtown Denver either through central downtown via the Convention Center or to Union Station past Sports Authority Field and the Pepsi Center.

More information about RTD can be found at the Union Station and Civic Center bus stations at either end of 16th Street in downtown, or on the RTD website.  Local routes (denoted by a number) crisscross the city, supplemented by 'Limited' buses that stop less frequently on major arteries like Colfax and Colorado Boulevard.  These buses are denoted by an 'L' after the route number, and cost the same as a Local route.\n\nRTD also operates limited intercity coach service, mostly to the north suburbs and Boulder\/Longmont.  These coaches leave from Union Station or Civic Center Station at either end of the 16th Street Mall, and will have letters designating their routes.  Fares are $5 one-way.

Buying a round-trip ticket saves you a couple of bucks.\n\nMake sure to have change before you use SkyRide or buses.

The city has a fiercely loyal cycling culture, and it's reflected in the abundance of bike lanes and trails in and around downtown.  Main trails run along both Cherry Creek and the Platte, and bike lanes run down many downtown streets.  The lanes are sometimes dedicated and sometimes run with traffic, and are marked by a stencil of a bike in the street.

Bikes are treated legally like traffic in Denver, and (while admittedly rare), you can get tickets for running red lights and stop signs.  Bikes are also expected to ride as far to the right as practicable, unless you're riding in a group of 3 or more - in which case you are considered (and can behave like) a car.

Use your common sense when traveling, particularly in downtown and some of the other inner-city neighborhoods. Denver does have a more visible population of homeless people, but the city has strict laws about accosting for money. In general, panhandlers don't harm anyone. Downtown has a fairly active 24\/7 population, especially in LoDo, so it's generally safe.\n\nStill, it may be a good idea not to travel alone at night in some of the neighborhoods surrounding downtown.

The rest of Denver is safe, though.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Emergencies"]},"\nLike the rest of the United States, the emergency number in Denver is 911.

If you need to report a crime to the police, such as a burglary (not in progress), minor assault (no injuries and not in progress), car theft, etc. Dial +1 720 913-2000 and request for police assistance.\n\nThe Denver Police is the main police force for the Denver Metro area.

Denver is called the Mile High City for a reason—at an altitude of a mile above sea level, one can start to experience some of the effects of altitude sickness though generally this condition becomes more pronounced at elevations around 8000 ft (2500 m) and above. Some normal changes may occur when people travel to higher altitudes that are not altitude sickness. These include the following:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Hyperventilation (breathing faster and\/or deeper than normal)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Shortness of breath after exertion"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Changes in nightly breathing"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Awaking at night"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Increased urination"]},"\nThe above are generally nothing to worry about, though problems with breathing may be helped by a drug called acetazolamide. If you think you may have problems, get advice from your doctor before traveling to Denver.\n\nSome people get Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS), which can be serious, at the higher elevations you will experience if you are touring through the Rocky Mountains. A diagnosis of AMS is usually given if a person has a headache accompanied by one of more of the following symptoms:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Loss of appetite, vomiting and\/or nausea"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Fatigue or weakness"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Dizziness or light-headedness"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Insomnia, difficulty sleeping"]},"\nSome people liken AMS to a bad hangover or worse. It occurs because your brain tissue swells at higher elevations than it is used to. If you are feeling unwell at high altitudes, assume that you are suffering from AMS unless there is another logical explanation that would be accompanied by other symptoms (food poisoning or a viral infection).\n\nTo avoid AMS, try to get to a lower elevation until your symptoms subside, drink lots of fluid to avoid dehydration, and avoid traveling at high rates of ascent.

This is especially true in Colorado, with both dry air that saps the skin of protective moisture and with the beautifully sunny days we have in the state.\n\nColorado actually has the highest rate of skin cancer in the country, so it is always a good idea to wear a lot of high SPF sun-screen, hats, long sleeve shirts and pants.
