In case that happened, the lingam would remain fixed on that spot forever. The gods, who were unhappy at the prospect of the divine lingam being established in the enemy kingdom, which would render them powerless against their adversary, worked a trick on Ravana. He mistakenly handed over the lingam to a brahmin, who grounded it at Deoghar. Ravana did his best to uproot it but beyond breaking the tip he was unsuccessful. In deep remorse, he used to come to this place everyday and worship the lingam by offering water from the Ganges. Historically the temple is dated to 1596. The temple has almost all god & goddesses and whole temple is built on a single rock. During the month of 'Sawan' people from across the country come to offer ganga jal to the divine Shiva ling."]},"\nFor centuries, devotees, in the month of Shravan (June-July) undertake a rigorous 100-km pilgrimage on foot from Ajgaibinath (Sultanganj) in Bhgalpur district to offer holy water from the Ganges to the lingam at Deoghar. Be advised that it is very crowded in Deoghar during this period as more than 5 million devotees visit every year. Hence it is not recommended for a casual traveler to visit Deoghar during these months. \n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Nandan Pahar"]}," -  A picnic spot with some basic rides atop a small hill.
