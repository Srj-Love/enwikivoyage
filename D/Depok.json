It is thus not hard to imagine that the road can be very crowded in the mornings and the evenings.\n\nThe other way to get into Depok is to take the Bogor line train. Depok has five stations: Citayam, Depok, Depok Baru, Pondok Cina, Universitas Indonesia. All economy class (including AC-economy class) trains stop at these stations, and express services stop at Depok and Depok Baru. Several express and semi-express trains stop at Universitas Indonesia halt, obviously for the benefit of students, but also useful when you are living in the northern part of the city. Ticket cost ranges from Rp.1500 (non A\/C economy), Rp.5500 (AC-economy) to Rp.9000 (express), and it takes 25 to 70 minutes to get to Depok depending on the train class and on from where in Jakarta you're coming from.\n\nDAMRI buses once had a service connecting Depok directly to Soekarno-Hatta International airport, but probably due to frequent traffic jams occurred between Depok and Jakarta, the service had stopped. The nearest airport bus pickup points are Pasar Minggu, in southern Jakarta, and also Kampung Rambutan bus terminal, in eastern Jakarta, to which you can go by regular bus or angkot. Alternatively, you can always travel by taxi, which you can find easily in Jalan Margonda Raya, or order by phone. Both reliable Blue Bird and Taxiku taxi companies have their depots in Depok.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nThe usual means of public transportation in Depok are angkot (minibuses) which ply Jl. Margonda Raya, the price is fixed Rp.2000. Taxis from Jakarta are also available, but in very limited quantities compared to Jakarta. Taking a train (say, from UI to Depok proper) is also an option if your destination is not too far from the railway station.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Go to University of Indonesia and spend time near its lake."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Visit ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Setu Babakan"]]}]}," (lake of Babakan) and watch the traditional folkloric dances that take place on Wednesdays and Sundays."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nCycling, walking and jogging at the University of Indonesia Campus are another recreational activities during weekend in Depok. Many locals go there especially on Sunday. Free market is available in this moment close to university's fence where you can buy cheap things from food to CDs, and from clothes to utensils.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\nAt the end of the year, it's the durian season; durian is a tropical fruit sold by locals along the road from Depok to Bogor. Durians here are cheap and good enough with price ranging from Rp 5,000 - Rp 30,000.  Don't hesitate to bargain the price and tell them that you only pay a good one.  The seller will choose the fruit for you, open a small hole and take a little fruit for you to taste.  If you're satisfied with the taste, they will open the whole fruit for you if you want to finish the fruit in their place.  \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nDepok has 2 main roads connecting north and south region title Jl Raya Bogor and Jl Margonda. There are many restaurants along these roads with various cuisine from East Java to Western cuisine.  \n\nA cheaper meal can be found in students cafe either in the university or in a area close to the university. One portion meal is about Rp 5,000 - Rp 15,000.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nLike other city in West Java province, Depok has similar drinks. The variety of options are young coconut water with ice and palm sugar, mixed chunk fruit and jelly with ice, blended fruit with ice. They are refreshing for a really hot day. For those who is on diet should drink carefully because they are high energy drinks.\n\nMost drinks seller buy ice cubes from a market and bring them by motor bike or tricycle. Ice cubes handling is careless with the possible spread of bacteria. Therefore caution should be taken and take anti-diarrhea if required.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nAlong Margonda road, there are only 2 hotels available. They're 3 stars hotel named \"Bumi Wiyata Hotel\" and \"Wisma Makara\" owned by University of Indonesia. Standard room in Bumi Wiyata is Rp 450,000 and the cheapest room in Wisma Makara is Rp 225,000.\n\nBumi Wiyata located in the main road and close to amenity whereas Wisma Makara located within University and a little bit far from main road.  Choose Wisma Makara if peaceful and simplicity are your preference.\n\nFor longer-term staying, the Margonda Residence Apartments, located on Margonda Raya is quite useful. It costs between IDR 1,350,000 to IDR 1,700,000 per month for a studio room, with a minimal contract of three months. As yet, it is the only apartment in Depok although others are being built. It is across the road from Universitas Indonesia, on the north part of the city, and thus is safe from much of the traffic jam in the city (although one still has to negotiate the traffic on the Jakarta side).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay Safe"]},"\n\nCompared to Jakarta and its other western and eastern satellite cities (",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Tangerang"]]}]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Bekasi"]]}]}," respectively), Depok is relatively safer.  \n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Depok"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["-6.390000"],["106.830000"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["West Java"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]}]
