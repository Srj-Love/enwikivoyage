It is situated on the river Foyle in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["County Londonderry"]]},", close to county ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Donegal"]]}," in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Republic of Ireland"]]},". It has a population of roughly 100,000.\nNote that the name of the city is a point of political dispute, with unionists advocating the longer name, and nationalists advocating the shorter.  A common attempt at compromise is to refer to the county as \"Londonderry\" and the city as \"Derry\", but this is by no means universally accepted.  Because of this, a peculiar situation arises as there is no common consensus either in politics or elsewhere as to which name is preferred; the city council is officially known as \"Derry\", but the city is officially recognised as \"Londonderry\" by the Northern Ireland Executive and the UK government. Whilst road signs in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Republic of Ireland"]]}," use \"Derry\", alongside the Irish language translation \"Doire\", road signs in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Northern Ireland"]]}," will always read (unless vandalised) \"Londonderry\".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nSituated on the banks of River Foyle, Derry is the second largest city in Northern Ireland and one of the oldest inhabited places in the whole island of Ireland. As they say there, 'Derry was a city when Belfast was still a swamp'. Derry's history dates back over 1,450 years, a lasting reminder of the early inhabitants of the area is the Iron Age fort, just over the border in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["County Donegal"]]},", known as the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Burt (Republic of Ireland)"],["Grianan of Aileach"]]},".\n\nIn the 6th Century St Columba\/Colmcille established a monastery in Derry. Shifting ten centuries later to the Plantation of Ulster, King James I of England had the wealthy guilds of London build up the city of Derry (hence the title Londonderry) and surround it by the defensive walls that still ring the city today.\n\nThese walls witnessed one of the most prominent events in the history of Derry. In 1688 the city was laid siege by the Earl of Antrim and the Catholic forces of James II, the English king who was deposed in favour of Protestant William of Orange. The settlers of the city who were protestant, barricaded themselves within the walls, when a group of apprentice boys from London on seeing the on coming forces, locked the city gates and so started the Great Siege of Derry.\n\nThe siege was to be the longest in British history, lasting some 105 days, during which an estimated third of the city’s then population of 30,000 died through disease and starvation. When James II himself rode up to the city walls and lay down terms for surrender he was greeted with shouts of ‘No Surrender’. The siege was finally broken when the relief ship Mountjoy broke the boom which was laid across the River Foyle beside the city.\n\nHowever the legacy of the Great Siege of Derry lasted for centuries with the Catholic and Protestant communities in Derry still largely divided today. During the years of the Troubles, Derry witnessed some of the most prominent and terrible events of those times. It was on Derry's Bogside area that British soldiers shot dead 14 civil rights protesters in what became known as Bloody Sunday. The majority of the Bogside murals commemorate this tragic loss of innocences. \n\nSince the peace process in Northern Ireland, Derry is slowly emerging as an upbeat cosmopolitan city with great potential and huge tourist interest. In July 2010, Derry was awarded City of Culture for 2013. A lot of Derry’s sights are meshed with its history, the 16th Century walls which surround the city are among the oldest and the best preserved citadel walls in Europe.  \n\nA huge percentage of Derry’s population fall into the 20 – 30 age group and there are plenty of places to cater for them with lots of clothes shops and boutiques, pubs, bars and clubs and Derry's traditional Irish and folk music scene are well established.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cityofderryairport.com\/ City of Derry Airport"]}]}," (airport code LDY) an airport serving Derry, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["County Tyrone"]]},", and Donegal in the Republic of Ireland, located 11km north-east of the city centre.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ryanair.com\/ Ryanair"]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alicante"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Birmingham (England)"],["Birmingham"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Faro"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Glasgow"]]}," (Prestwick),  London (Stansted), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Liverpool"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tenerife"]]}," (South)."]},"\nTaxis are available from the airport, with the typical fares to the city centre around £12, with the journey taking roughly 15 minutes.\n\nThere is also a bus service but given the intermittent timetable, unless you're short of cash, you should just take a taxi.
