Why pottery production is centered on this small town seems to be due to the quality of the local clay. Deruta reached its zenith in the 16th Century with much of its pottery drawing inspiration from the Renaissance and from painters such as Raphael, who came from nearby ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gubbio"]]},".\nThere are more than 300 ceramic firms in Deruta today and it is still possible to visit the artists at work in some of the smaller shops. The larger shops, along the main highway, mainly cater to passing coach parties but to buy the real thing you have to venture up into the hill town. Much of the production is still carried out as a cottage industry. Unbaked pottery is first baked in the ovens and then taken away to be hand-painted, before being returned to the ovens for glazing. The quality of the glaze is a particular feature of Derutaâ€™s pottery.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Piazza dei Consoli"]},".
