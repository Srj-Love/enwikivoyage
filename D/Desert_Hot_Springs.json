Most visitors are here to chill in the desert, and relax at one of the many hotel\/spas. The naturally hot mineral waters flowing into the soaking pools is heated by the earth's magma and is unusual that it contains no sulfur smell and is tasteless. \n\nThe hot water table is actually above the cold water table and in some places is so near the surface it leaks out of the earth. Soaking in the naturally hot mineral waters proves therapeutically beneficial to those suffering arthritis, bursitis, muscular fatigue or damage and is generally healing to the body. In some places the wells measure temperatures as high as 140 degrees requiring cooling of the waters before they flow into the soaking pools. \n\nThe waters that flow into the pools also flow out of the pools into retention basins that allow the waters to slowly soak back into the earth. By this method the pools are constantly refreshed with new waters flowing in, so less chlorine is required.\n\nThe ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/cityofdhs.org city of Desert Hot Springs"]},", once known as Spa City, was founded by Cabot Yerxa and came into being in the 1950s due to the hot mineral springs.
