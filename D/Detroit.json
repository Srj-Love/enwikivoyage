Two major traffic circles along Woodward Avenue surround Campus Martius Park and Grand Circus Park, both gathering points. The city has ample parking much of it in garages. Many historic buildings have been converted into loft apartments, and over sixty new businesses have opened in the Central Business District over the past two years. Downtown Detroit features the Renaissance Center, including the tallest hotel in the Western Hemisphere, the Detroit Marriott, with the largest rooftop restaurant, Coach Insignia. Many restaurants emanate from the Renaissance Center, Greektown, the arts and theatre district, and stadium area. Joining the eastern, riverfront parks, the city has the 982-acre (3.9 kmÂ²; 2.42 sq mi) Belle Isle Park with the large James Scott Memorial Fountain, historic conservatory, gardens, and spectacular views of the city skyline.\n\nVisitors may reserve a public dock downtown at the Tri-Centennial State Park and Harbor. Great Lakes Cruises are also available.

Detroit has a rich architectural heritage, such as the recently restored historic Westin Book-Cadillac Hotel, the Guardian and Fisher buildings with exquisitely ornate interiors and exteriors, the Detroit Institute of Arts (top five museums in the country) to name a few. In 2005, Detroit's architecture was heralded as some of America's finest; many of the city's architecturally significant buildings are listed by the National Trust for Historic Preservation as among America's most endangered landmarks.\n\nDetroit is the largest city in the U.S. to offer casino resorts. The three major casino resorts are MGM Grand Detroit, Greektown, and MotorCity. A fourth major casino is just across the river in Windsor, Canada.  Detroit Metro Airport is one of the few to offer world class hotel and meeting facilities inside the terminal. The Renaissance Center and the Southfield Town Center are among the nation's finest mixed use facilities for large conferences. Downtown Detroit serves as the cultural and entertainment hub of the metropolitan region, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Windsor (Ontario)"],["Windsor"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ontario"]]},", and even for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Toledo (Ohio)"],["Toledo"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ohio"]]}," residents, many of whom work in metropolitan Detroit. While most of the region's attractions are in the city of Detroit, tourists will find that nearly all of the shopping malls are located in suburbs, such as Troy. The Detroit-Windsor metro area population totals about 5.9 million; it jumps to 6.5 million if Toledo is included. An estimated 46 million people live within a 300 mi (480 km) radius of Detroit. The city's northern inner ring suburbs like Ferndale, Southfield, Royal Oak, and Birmingham provide an urban experience in the suburbs complete with dining, shopping and other attractions. The Detroit area has many regal mansions, within the city and especially in Grosse Pointe, Bloomfield Hills, and Birmingham.  Ann Arbor provides the nearby experience of a college town.\n\nDetroit is an international destination for sporting events of all types; patrons enjoy their experience in world class venues. The Detroit Convention and Visitors bureau maintains the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.detroitsports.org Detroit Metro Sports Commission"]},". The city and region have state of the art facilities for major conferences and conventions.\n\nDetroit is known as the world's \"Automobile Capital\" and \"Motown\" (for \"Motor Town\"), the city where Henry Ford pioneered the automotive assembly line, with the world's first mass produced car, the Model T. During World War II, President Franklin Roosevelt called Detroit the \"Arsenal of Democracy.\" Today, the region serves as the global center for the automotive world. Headquartered in metro Detroit, General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler all have major corporate, manufacturing, engineering, design, and research facilities in the area. Hyundai, Toyota, Nissan, among others, have a presence in the region. The University of Michigan in Ann Arbor is a global leader in research and development. Metro Detroit has made Michigan's economy a leader in information technology, life sciences, and advanced manufacturing. Michigan ranks fourth nationally in high tech employment with 568,000 high tech workers, including  70,000 in the automotive industry. Michigan typically ranks among the top three states for overall research and development investment expenditures in the US. The domestic auto industry accounts directly and indirectly for one of every ten jobs in the US.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Imperial"],["janhigh = 31"],["febhigh = 33"],["marhigh = 44"],["aprhigh = 58"],["mayhigh = 70"],["junhigh = 79"],["julhigh = 83"],["aughigh = 81"],["sephigh = 74"],["octhigh = 62"],["novhigh = 48"],["dechigh = 35"],["janlow = 16"],["feblow = 18"],["marlow = 27"],["aprlow = 37"],["maylow = 48"],["junlow = 57"],["jullow = 62"],["auglow = 60"],["seplow = 53"],["octlow = 41"],["novlow = 32"],["declow = 22"],["janprecip = 1.9"],["febprecip = 1.7"],["marprecip = 2.4"],["aprprecip = 3"],["mayprecip = 2.9"],["junprecip = 3.6"],["julprecip = 3.1"],["augprecip = 3.4"],["sepprecip = 2.8"],["octprecip = 2.2"],["novprecip = 2.7"],["decprecip = 2.5"],["jansnow = 12.5"],["febsnow = 10.4"],["marsnow = 6.9"],["aprsnow = 1.7"],["maysnow = -"],["junsnow = -"],["julsnow = -"],["augsnow = -"],["sepsnow = -"],["octsnow = 0.1"],["novsnow = 1.4"],["decsnow = 9.7"],["description = ",{"type":"{{","value":[["ForecastNOAA"],["Detroit"],["42.33317"],["-83.04788"]]}]]},"\nDetroit's climate is continental, therefore subject to rapid change and a variety of weather.

Highways, the Lodge Freeway, M-14, M-23, and the Southfield Freeway are major freeways which interconnect with the Interstates in the Detroit metro area to ease navigation. The Southfield Freeway connects Dearborn to Southfield. The Lodge Freeway, connects Southfield to downtown. Highway M-14 connects Ann Arbor to Detroit via the Jeffries Expressway. Bypassing Ann Arbor, highway M-23 connects I-94 to I-96. \n\nThe metro area's major Interstates and freeways were overhauled in preparation the 2006 National Football League Super Bowl XL in Detroit and are in good condition.  \n\nAs with any major city, traffic during rush hour can make travel really slow. This is especially aggravated during shift changes at the local automotive plants. But due to economic hardships for the region, rush hour traffic lasts less than an hour, and some freeways are clear all day. The Mixing Bowl, I-75\/696 interchange, the I-94\/Ford Freeway through Detroit, and the Southfield Freeway can be slow in late afternoons. However some freeways can be congested. \n\nThe following freeways have chronic congestion in the morning and evening rush:\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Northbound I-75"]},": Between 8 Mile and 12 Mile"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Southbound I-75"]},": Between Rochester Curve and I-696"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Westbound I-696"]},": Dequindre Curve to Woodward; Coolidge Highway out the Mixing Bowl; Drake Rd. to I-96."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Eastbound I-696"]},": Mixing Bowl to Woodward Ave.; Groesbeck Highway to I-94"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Westbound I-96"]},": Off of I-696 to Wixom Rd.

This was due to first French development (strip farms along the river), early city layout (wheel and spoke from the river's edge), followed by the modern North\/South grid. Mile roads run east-west, starting at downtown Detroit and increasing as you travel north. These mile roads may change name in different cities, so pay attention. There are also several spoke roads, including Woodward Ave, Michigan Ave, Gratiot Ave, and Grand River Ave. Only in the old downtown business district is the original Washington D.C.\/L'Enfant-style wheel and spoke layout found (it is quite confusing, with several one-way streets added for fun). In areas along the River and Lake St. Clair, the colonial-era French practice of allocating strips of land with water access is seen as main roads parallel the water, and secondary roads perpendicular to it.

Six major spoke roads radiate out from downtown; they are, in clockwise order, Fort Street, Michigan Avenue, Grand River Avenue, Woodward Avenue, Gratiot Avenue, and Jefferson Avenue. Woodward Avenue runs northwest-southeast (more or less) and divides the northern half of Detroit into east and west; West Warren Street, for instance, becomes East Warren Street when it crosses Woodward. Smaller streets generally conform to a strict grid pattern, but the orientation of the grid and the size and shape of blocks frequently varies to fit better with the spoke roads. Downtown, the layout abandons the grid design, with the spoke roads converging in a confusing but oddly logical arrangement of diagonal, mostly one-way streets.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nDetroit spreads over a large area, it is difficult to be without a car.
