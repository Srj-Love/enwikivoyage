Worked as a military fortress until 1687 when it was occupied by Austrian troops for the second time. The fortress was a time in possession: Hunedorestilor Family, Francis Gesthy, princes of Transylvania (Gabriel Bethlem, Stefan Bethlem, Gh Rakokzi I, A. Barcsay).\n\nThe walls of the fortress were besieged often of peasant uprisings culminating with the siege in 1784 during the rebellion of Horia, Cloșca and Crișan. At the end of the 13th century,the fortress has lost strategic importance and was left in decay until 1817 when it was restored by Emperor Francisc I. During the Revolution of 1848, the fortress was occupied by Austrian soldiers and was destroyed in an explosion of the guns store. Over the years, the fortress has undergone many repairs and changes. Fortress complex consists of a central building on top of the hill and the three chambers equipped with gates and reinforced with defensive towers. The walls that can be seen now belong 15th-17th century. You can reach the Fortress on foot by climbing the 113 stepts from the city park and then following one of the two alleys which are surrounding the fortress hill.\n\nStarting in June 2005, Fortress can be reached also by cable car.The cable car eases access of tourists to the Fortress"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Museum of Dacian and Roman Civilisation"],["alt=Muzeul Civilizației Dacice și Romane"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat=45.885884"],["long=22.898308"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=09:00 - 21:00"],["price="],["content=It is the Hunedoara County Museum.It houses reliefs from Ulpia Traiana and Micia, forge, bronze pieces, costumes, tools, weaving, ceramics, glass icons.
