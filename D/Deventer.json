Situated along the river IJssel and a member of the Hanseatic League, this town in the province of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Overijssel"]]}," offers a great collection of heritage. It is home to the country's oldest brick house, the oldest park and the oldest academic library.

It is believed that it was the Anglo-Saxon missionary Lebuinus who established the settlement that became Deventer, by building a church there around 870. In the 11th and 12th century, Deventer was a very important and wealthy city. A member of the Hanseatic League, her wealth was mostly achieved by trading along the river IJssel. Many of the buildings erected in those profitable days still remain and the historic centre make Deventer an appealing town for visitors. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Schiphol Airport"]]}]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["AMS"]]},") near Amsterdam is the largest airport in the vicinity.

The ",{"type":"'''","value":["Waag"]}," is a good place to start, as it houses the Tourist Information Office as well as a museum. Themed walking routes can be obtained here. As in most Dutch cities, pedestrian road signs also give directions to the prime sights. \n\nA small passenger ferry runs all through the day to bring pedestrians to the other side of the IJssel river, allowing for easy access to the Ossenwaard natural area, which offers lovely walks and (in summer) some pleasant river side beach areas. No bikes are allowed on the ferry, and a single\/return ticket costs â‚¬1\/1.40. The ferry ride offers some nice views over town and makes it possible to park without charge at the Worp (so on the other side of the river). \n\nTo see more of the city's natural surroundings, renting a bicycle is a good alternative. They're available from the VVV Tourist Office in the Waag building. When it's closed, on Sundays, try the Fletcher Gildehotel (",{"type":"''","value":["Nieuwstraat"]},") or the Sandton IJsselhotel (",{"type":"''","value":["at the Worp, across the river"]},").\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Deventer Waag-VNP.jpg"],["thumb"],["Deventer Waag-VNP"]]},"\nThe oldest part of the town, just south of the railway station, still contains many medieval buildings.

The ",{"type":"'''","value":["Brink"]}," is the central square, and when the new city wall was constructed in 1350, it became an important trading quarter.\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bergkwartier"]}," area is a small part of Deventer centered around the Bergkerk, a church placed on a hillock that came into being around the 12th century. The yearly markets ushered in a new age of prosperity for Deventer. Newcomers settled in the newest part of town, Bergkwartier. It is situated between the main marketplace (Brink) and the harbor. The prosperity ended in 1570, when Deventer became the focal point of various wars. New defensive works where created to protect those in the new part of town, which later helped to secure the city from unwanted company. This irrevocably meant the end of the expansion of the district, as tearing down the defense works to expand the city was forbidden. The traders that came until 1570 left leaving Bergkwartier and all the heritage that can be seen today.\n\nToday, after many years of restoration, many old buildings have lost their function as warehouse and have become living quarters, shops, taverns, restaurants and offices. A lot of old sights were restored, as some were in decay or damaged by various wars.
