Located on the eastern slope of the extreme Southern Appalachians one is hard pressed to believe they are in the deep South. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThe Park is a focal point as the gateway to the Jocassee Gorges Conservation Area which bounds between North and South Carolina. The Lake is amazingly deep at up to 350 feet and can only truly be appreciated by boat as the waterfalls and rivers cascade from the distant shore across from Devils Fork. Guided waterfalls tours are available as well as fresh water fishing charters departing from the boat ramp at the Park. The Lake's 75 mile shoreline is almost completely protected from development and is unique unto itself in the region. Visitors can either stay at the Park's cabins, campground or nearby private vacation rentals.  Reservations are a must as the region is very rural and vacancies in season are scarce. The Park is open year round and attracts over 250,000 visitors annually.\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\nOnly known habitat for the Oconee Bell\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nModerate year round temperatures \/ Temperate Southern Rain Forest annual rainfall 75 plus inches per year\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nCampground \/ RV Park \/ Local Pet Friendly vacation rentals \/ No Pets in Park cabins\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\nAnnual SC Park Pass $50 \/ Daily Access Fee $2 per person\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nGuided waterfall tours are available.
