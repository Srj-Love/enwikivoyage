The main part of the town, ",{"type":"''","value":["West Devonport"]}," is largely situated between the Don River to the West and Mersey River to the East. The other part of the town, ",{"type":"''","value":["East Devonport"]}," is situated directly across the Mersey River from the town centre. Devonport boasts a number of pleasant beaches, natural bush reserves and striking headlands including the Mersey Bluff with its lighthouse sitting atop.\n\nDevonport is the closest point of arrival to the World Heritage listed ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park"],["Cradle Mountain-Lake St. Clair National Park"]]},", only around an hours drive away.\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By ship"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Tasmania_devonport_spirit_of_tasmania.jpg"],["right"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Spirit of Tasmania in Devonport Harbour"]]},"\n\nDevonport is the Tasmanian arrival port for the Spirit of Tasmania ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.spiritoftasmania.com.au\/ "]}," passenger ferries from the mainland.\n\nThe ",{"type":"''","value":["Spirit of Tasmania I"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["Spirit of Tasmania II"]}," travel the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Melbourne"]]}," - Devonport route providing an overnight service in both directions every day of the year. The vessels depart at 8PM and arrive the following morning at 7AM. During peak periods there are additional daytime crossings, departing at 9AM and arriving the same day at 6PM, and the overnight ferry going from 9PM until 6AM.  The ferry travels faster!  The ferry terminal is in East Devonport, directly across the river from the town centre.  Boarding closes 45 minutes before the departure time, and it is not unusual for the ship to be sailing well away from the wharf at the time of scheduled departure.\n\nThere are restaurants, both buffet and a-la-carte on board.  There is a cinema, several bars, and live music during summer crossings.  There shop selling essentials, and tourist items.  There is a phone which works while at sea, and a ATM which doesn't.\n\nTelstra has mobile reception and 3G data is available throughout the ship, even when at sea.  No other mobile or data services are available.\n\nThe vessels have a wide variety of accommodation, these include Cruise Seats, Business Class Seats, Inside 3, 4 Berth Cabin, Porthole 3, 4 Berth Cabin, Inside Twin Cabin, Porthole Twin Cabin and the luxurious Deluxe Cabins.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Fares"]},"\nIts cheap to take your car onboard, at $65 per car year around each way.  The cost is subsidised by the federal government as part of the national highway budget.  Unfortunately you can't send your car unaccompanied, and you will have to buy at least one seat on the ship.\n\nA seat usually costing between $120 and $180 depending on the time of year.  The cheapest cabin costing between $170 and $280 per person, depending on the time of year each way.  More for a twin or deluxe cabin, more for a porthole.\n\nIt can easily be cheaper to fly than to take the ship, and as a guide a flight and a week of car hire in a small car for a couple usually works out around the same price as a return trip with a car in a twin cabin.\n\nMotorbikes cost $45, and bicycles cost $7.  However, officially these are only entitled to the subsidised rate if they are your form of transportation.  If you can get the bicycles on the car on a bike rack within the standard car length, then you pay no extra for them.\n\nThe ship docks in East Devonport which is linked by a passenger ferry across the Mersey to the town centre.  However it doesn't run as early as the ferry arrives, or as late as the ferry arrives, and not at all on Sunday.

So it makes sense to get around on foot. If your apartment or hotel is not close to the city center, a taxi will come and pick you up. Remember Devonport is, beside the ferry terminus, a small country town.\n\nIt is a fair walk from the ferry terminus in East Devonport to downtown in West Davenport.  A passenger ferry service operates across the Mersey form the ferry to the town, but does not operate on Sundays.\n\nAn offroad cycleway follows the waterfront, going up to the lighthouse.  However the two sections of cycleway rely on the passenger ferry to connect them, which doesn't run early mornings, late nights, or on Sundays, so on those days East Devonport is inaccessible unless you want to cycle on the road, and take the freeway bridge.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Tiagarra Aboriginal Cultural Centre"]}," A museum of aboriginal history, with a nature trail that takes you to view natural rock formations that have been mistaken for Aboriginal rock carvings.
