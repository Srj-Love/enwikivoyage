The area was ruled by the Buddhist kingdom of Kamarupa and the Pala Empire before passing to the control of the Hindu Sena dynasty in the 9th century. The Islamic Mughal Empire soon seized control of the city and turned it into a center of trade and governance. In the years of their vigorous rule, the successive governors and princely viceroys who ruled the province adorned it with many noble monuments, mosques, tombs, fortifications and 'Katras', often surrounded with beautifully laid out gardens and pavilions. The city passed through another phase under the rule of the British, until it became the seat of the eastern division of Pakistan after Indian partitioning. The Liberation War of 1971 gave Bangladesh its independence and Dhaka was declared the country's capital.\n\nSince then, Dhaka has been developing fast as a modern city and is the country's centre of industrial, commercial, cultural, educational and political activity. The gap between rich and poor is widening throughout the country, but it's at its most glaringly obvious here. Depending on where you start from, a thirty minute rickshaw ride can take you from impossibly crowded shantytowns near Old Dhaka to the glitzy high-class neighbourhoods of Gulshan and Banani where a meal costs more than most people earn in a week.\n\nMotijheel is the main commercial area of the city.

Not all are out to gouge you, so better to find the honest ones and give them your business. Occasionally a driver will demand more money on arrival; the best way to deal with this is to hand over the agreed or metered fare and walk away. Make certain from the start that the driver knows where you're headed (unless you can direct him yourself) - they often have limited local knowledge, but will always say that they know where somewhere is, and take you 'round the whole city searching whilst the meter ticks. Make sure that you take a card with your hotel or hostel written on it so that you can actually get home. Having a card for the hotel with the actual address makes this a whole lot easier.\n\nThe trains in Bangladesh only operate between major regional cities. There is no suburban or metro rail system in Dhaka, although there are plans to build an elevated inner-city line by mid-2013.

They make up the bulk of the city's horrendous traffic, and charge around Tk 15 per kilometre. Negotiating a fare beforehand is essential as a foreigner. Rickshaws in wealthy areas such as Banani and Gulshan often must pay local mafia men for the privilege of servicing the high-price areas. This can sometimes mean drivers are apprehensive to take passengers to these areas. Additionally, foreigners should also be warned that rickshaws will sometimes begin the ride with a pitch to sell drugs or prostitutes. This is very rare. One or two simple, but firm, declines will generally solve the situation. If you're a woman, it's particularly inadvisable to ride around alone in rickshaws after dark; you're a slow-moving target asking for trouble from thugs and muggers. Take a yellow taxi instead.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By car "]},"\nDriving a car in the capital can be a nerve-wracking experience. Officially, cars drive on the left, although the reality can be different. Locals will often zoom down the wrong side of the road in an attempt to overcome the traffic. Traffic police monitor most intersections in the city, in an attempt to keep the traffic flowing. Many intersections have been upgraded with traffic signals, but these are often ignored by both drivers and traffic police, who will direct cars as they see fit.\n\nThere are some options for car rental, with ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.europcar.com\/car-BANGLADESH.html Europcar"]}," being the notable Western brand name.

They're the cheapest way to cover longer distances; an 8 km ride from Old Dhaka to Gulshan should cost around Tk 150-200. The meters start at Tk 13.50, but you'll likely have to negotiate a fare instead. The city does become very congested at times, so allow plenty of time for getting around.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By taxi "]},"\nTaxis ply the roads, some yellow and some black, all with meters. Black taxis start the meter at Tk 15 while yellow taxis have slightly higher standards in terms of comfort, and start at Tk 20. Black taxis are typically in notoriously poor condition and lack air conditioning. Yellow taxis are required to have air conditioning; the fleet consists mostly of Toyota Corollas, with some Mitsubishis and Hondas. The yellow taxis are also considered far safer, in comparison to black taxis and auto-rickshaws.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By bus "]},"\nBuses run routes on the main roads, but are horribly crowded and noisy, signed only in Bengali and aren't likely to be of much use to travellers.

The zoo exhibits 58 species of mammals, including elephants, cheetahs, rhinos, zebras, waterbucks, otters, hyenas, deer, giraffes, impala, black bears, tapirs, hippos, lions, many species of monkeys, chimpanzees, baboons and Bengal tigers. The aviaries at the zoo house more than 1500 birds representing 91 species, including peacocks, rhea, African gray parrots, cassowary, owls, ostrich, emus, teals, finches, babblers, owls, vultures and eagles. The two lakes at the zoo also host migratory water birds each winter. Visitors can also see 13 species of reptiles including snakes and crocodiles, and 28 species of fish. You can also partake of elephant-back and horsr-back rides here."]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Museums"]},"\nThere are a number of Museums in Dhaka and all are very close to the city center. Each of the museums displays exhibits on different areas. Most museums are open 5 or 6 days a week, weekly holiday(s) are usually Thursday and\/or Friday.

Built on 5.46 acres of land, its spaces range in size from its 21-metre dome, seating 275 people; to three-metre inflatable and portable domes where people sit on the floor. The Planetarium dome simulates Earth and its cool blue sky. This dome-shaped theatre was built with the latest equipment, enabling visitors to soar into space as well as experience the thrills of an interplanetary journey in a three-dimensional environment. The curved ceiling represents the sky and shows moving images of planets and stars through projection onto a large-screen dome at an angle of 120 degrees.\n\nThis planetarium features three kinds of exhibits. They Journey to Infinity presents a celestial show of stars, planets and other heavenly bodies in virtual reality. The ai amader Bangladesh features Bangabandhu Sheik Mujibur Rahman`s 7 March lecture, while The Grand Canyon describes North America`s settlement clan, Garikhad, which existed in The Grand Canyon four thousand years ago. The planetarium also has a 30 seated Space Ride Simulator.\n\nThe Planetarium is open on Thursday to Tuesday - 6 days a week; Wednesday is weekly holiday.

Old Dhaka is overflowing with cheap Bangladeshi food where a meal can cost from Tk 50. In the upscale areas such as Gulshan and Banani are Chinese, Indian, Thai, Vietnamese, Greek and Mexican restaurants, and franchises such as Pizza Hut and KFC - all at prices that the majority can't afford. Reservations are usually not required in most restaurants. A lot of the Buffet-style restaurants in this area have Taka: 250 to 400, fixed price menu.\n\nLocal sweets (misti\/mishti) like ",{"type":"''","value":["rasogollah"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["golap jam\/pantuya\/ledikeni"]}," are excellent, these are bite-sized soft milk curd balls dipped (drenched) in syrup, and come in white and red varieties. Shops throughout the town (and especially near Gulshan) sell imported condiments from Dubai, Europe Malaysia and the USA at a premium. Imported chocolate is especially expensive - and usually not in the best condition as it gets melted and re-solidified daily in the tropical heat. Fresh is better.\n\nBe careful when buying food from street vendors as health and hygiene standards are not always top notch. Unlike Bangkok—street food in Dhaka is only for locals. Foreigners should stick to larger, organized (and unfortunately a little expensive) food outlets.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nThere is a party network between the different expat clubs (Dutch Club, Canadian Club, Nordic Club, International Club, American Club, etc.) and some Bangladeshi clubs (Heritage, Privilege, etc.). These clubs usually require membership to enter, or befriend a member and have them sign you in. From there, you can purchase a book of tickets or a cash card and then use it to order your drinks.\n\nAlthough alcohol is most easily available at the international clubs and top hotels, there are quite a few local places to find a drink for the enterprising traveller. Local bars are to be found in most neighbourhoods but can be difficult to locate due to lack of advertising. Popular brands of beer (Heineken, Carlsberg, Tuborg, Foster's etc.) and major types of spirits are available at these places, and at much lower prices than at hotel bars.\n\nYou can try:\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["La Diplomat"]}," at Road 20, House number 7, near  Gulshan 1.

Female patrons may feel slightly uncomfortable."]},"\nThere is a duty paid shop in Mohakhali (the name of the company is H.

The address is 12 Abbas Garden, New Airport Road, phone +88 2''988 1936-9. Their stated opening hours are from 09:30 - 16:30, and closed on Fridays and Saturdays. To get there you need to go towards the flyover as if you were going to Banani, but instead of going on to the flyover, you take the second left after it begins. You will see a small sign labelled \"Abbas Garden.\" Turn left and tell your transport to wait while you purchase.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["drink"],["name=North End Coffee"],["url=http:\/\/northendcoffee.com"],["email="],["address=Kha-47-1 Pragati Sarani, Shahzadpur, North Badda"],["lat=23.79098243"],["long=90.41939287"],["directions=Around the corner from US Embassy, across from Cambrian College and above the DBBL ATM"],["phone=01741055597"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Seven days 8AM-9PM, except Tuesday closed and Friday 14:00 to 21:00"],["price=cappuccino Tk125"],["content=Definitely the best coffee in Dhaka.

While the chances of anything bad happening upon exit are somewhat low, incidents such as ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.wanderingearl.com\/thank-you-to-the-militant-who-stole-my-car\/ kidnappings by taxi drivers"]}," are known to have happened to tourists who have tried to leave the airport in the small hours of the morning.\n\nOtherwise Dhaka isn't terribly unsafe, but as in any huge city you should keep aware of your surroundings and try not to walk around at night, especially females travelling alone. There's a very large number of people living on next to nothing in the city, and while the vast majority are friendly there's undoubtedly a few that would love to help you part with some of your seemingly abundant wealth.\n\nThere has been a recent rash of incidents (as of July 2007) in which some foreigners have been targeted for bag snatchings while riding rickshaws. Often these have occurred at night, after 23:00. If you must be out after this time please do your best to leave your valuables at your friends' places or hotel and you can pick them up in the morning. The simplest way to reduce your potential loss is to not leave with valuables in the first place if you anticipate the need to travel after 23:00. The safest mode for travel for a tourist is to hire a yellow cab. These can be rented for a trip as well as by the day. Be sure to write down the licence plate number.\n\nThe greatest danger probably comes from speeding buses and rickshaws - keep well alert when walking along main roads.\n\nBeing the capital, it's the area most affected during ",{"type":"''","value":["hartals"]},", and you should do your best to keep a low profile during times of political unrest.
