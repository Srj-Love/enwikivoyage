In the midst of this plain, Didcot stands out because of its huge coal-fired electricity generating plant, which dominates the skyline.\n\nDidcot grew up because it lies at the point where the Great Western Railway's line north to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oxford"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Birmingham (England)"],["Birmingham"]]}," branches off from the main line from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bristol"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cardiff"]]},". Since then a large military depot, now replaced by a business park, and the power station, have added to the economy.\n\nIf the above makes you think that Didcot sounds like an inappropriate destination for a tourist, you would probably be right. However, if you are a rail enthusiast, you may think differently as Didcot is the home of the Didcot Rail Centre (see 'See' below). And if you need to stay in Didcot because of business or personal commitments, don't despair, there are plenty of interesting places nearby (see 'Get out' below).\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Didcot Post office - geograph.org.uk - 1724428.jpg"],["thumb"],["left"],["Didcot Post Office"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Didcot Power Station - geograph.org.uk - 799400.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["Didcot power station"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nDidcot has a rail station on the main lines from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Reading (England)"],["Reading"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bristol"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cardiff"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oxford"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Birmingham (England)"],["Birmingham"]]},".
