It is well-known for a failed landing operation by predominantly Canadian Allied forces during WW2, on the 19th of August 1942. You won't find a French flag flying in Dieppe without a Canadian flag alongside it. Dieppe has a long and interesting history, having been an important port linking William the Conquerer's English kingdom with his Normandy Dukedom in the 11th century, and having endured centuries of conflict right up until 1944. Today, it's an important ferry and fishing port, and a pleasant seaside resort. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nThe ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.transmancheferries.com Transmanche Ferry"]}," from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Newhaven"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["England"]]}," carries cars and foot passengers across the English Channel (",{"type":"''","value":["la manche"]}," in French) in about 4 hours for 15 pounds each way.
