Tim Severin replicated this journey in the 1970s, demonstrating that the story was plausible.\n\nOnce described by the National Geographic Traveler as “the most beautiful place on earth”, the Dingle Peninsula is a place of intense allure, with a plethora of green landscapes, rocky hills, long sandy beaches and staggering cliff edges. The warm Gulf Stream reaches the peninsula, giving it a wonderful mixture of sometimes rare and unusual flora and fauna.\n\nDingle is one of Ireland’s Government-protected Irish (Gaelic)-speaking areas, called “Gaeltachts”. Dingle's Irish name is Daingean Uí Chúis which, to fit on signposts, is generally abbreviated to An Daingean. Despite this, everyone calls the town Dingle and you will be extremely hard pressed to find a single person who calls it An Daingean\n\nMany of the towns and villages in the region have Irish names too and, as many maps use the anglicised versions of these names, visitors are advised to purchase maps that give both the Irish and English versions of all place names.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nThe western part of the peninsula is Irish speaking, although no-one will expect you to speak any.
