The monument was created in 1915 to protect an extensive deposit of fossilized dinosaur skeletons as well as pictographs dating back 10,000 years.  The monument is divided into two districts, the Canyon Area on the east side and the Dinosaur Quarry on the west side.  Each district has its own visitor center.  Pets are allowed inside the monument but must be on a leash no longer than 6 ft (1.8 m).  Pets are not allowed inside any buildings or on any hiking trails.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nDinosaur National Monument's cultural history dates back 10,000 years.  The Yampa and Green Rivers have provided water for survival in an arid country.  Indian rock art in the form of petroglyphs and pictographs provide evidence that many people have come before us.  The Fremont Indians lived in the canyons in Dinosaur National Monument 800 - 1,200 years ago.  Following the Fremont were the Ute and Shoshone, who are still found in the area today.  Early settlers left their mark on the landscape with their homesteads.  Those who had access to the rivers and a constant flow of water survived, while others dried up with drought and moved away.  Now, many of the remains of homesteads are found alongside the Indian art work of the past.\n\nThe park's value as a site for dinosaur remains was established when paleontologist Earl Douglass first came to Utah looking for mammal fossils. He returned in 1909 and discovered an immense deposit of dinosaur bones, now protected at Dinosaur National Monument. Although made famous by dinosaurs, Douglass died preferring his beloved mammal fossils over dinosaurs.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\nThis part of Utah and Colorado is rocky-desert, with sinuous canyons deep-cut by rivers.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nDinosaur's climate is semiarid with temperatures averaging between 0°F (-17°C) to 30°F (-1°C) in January and 50°F (10°C) to 100°F (38°C) in July. Elevations within the park vary between 4700 and 9000 feet. Winter snow makes roads at higher elevations impassable while only light to moderate snow is found at lower elevations.

Distances can be deceptively long between services.  Watch for wildlife on monument and nearby roads. Wildlife can be abundant along roads during all seasons. Please observe speed limits and be aware of wildlife in the road corridor.  Four wheel drive may not be enough on some monument roads. Many park roads are clay-surfaced (unpaved), and become impassable when wet no matter what kind of vehicle you have. Get weather and road condition reports before traversing park roads.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Weather "]},"\n\nDinosaur is a land of extremes; please dress appropriately for the season. Summer temperatures can soar over 100F (38C); winter temperatures can drop well below 0 F (-18C). Summer nighttime temperatures can be cool. Dress appropriately, including proper shoes and headwear, use sunscreen. Dressing in non-cotton layers allows you to add and remove clothing as needed while not retaining moisture that can lead to hypothermia.\n\nAlways carry and drink plenty of water. Extreme temperatures, high elevation, and an arid landscape can lead to rapid water loss. Many locations may not have water readily accessible and may require backpackers\/hikers to carry fresh water. All water gathered in the monument must be treated before consumption.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Trails "]},"\n\nWatch Your Step. Trails are often rocky and uneven, and other hazards may be present. Slow down, enjoy the scenery, and watch your step.\n\nCarry food with you. At higher elevations your body must work harder than at lower elevations; more work means more calories burned. The monument ranges from 4700 feet to over 9000 feet in elevation. Salty foods can replace electrolytes lost through sweating. Eating helps your body use water efficiently.\n\nAfternoon thunderstorms during summer are common, and lighting can strike from miles away.  During summer thunderstorms avoid high, bare rock surfaces to prevent being struck by lightning.  If caught outside find the lowest point possible that is not near a tree or other tall object, and make yourself small\/short.  Also be aware of flash flooding in canyons; a storm miles away can send a wall of water raging down a canyon, flooding it within minutes, emptying just as fast.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Wildlife "]},"\n\nMost wildlife is more scared of you than you are of them. You might, however, surprise or startle wildlife or accidentally make an animal feel threatened. Watch where you walk; if you do come across wildlife, give it plenty of space as well as an escape route. Small children and pets may be particularly vulnerable – keep your group together at all times. Be wary of animals that are being aggressive.\n\nSnakes are an important and beneficial part of the ecosystem. Most snakes found in the monument are non-poisonous, but two are poisonous: the midget faded rattlesnake, and prairie rattlesnake. Snakes, like all wildlife in the monument, should be observed and enjoyed from a safe distance.\n\nPlants can bite, too. Many plants, including cactus, greasewood, Russian thistle, and others can scratch, stick, or otherwise be dangerous.
