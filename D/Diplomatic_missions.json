Most missions do not have staff or funding for various things you might think they should do.\n",{"type":"*","value":[" If you are broke and stranded, for example, they generally will not fly you home though they will contact family or friends for you and provide a channel for them to send money."]},{"type":"*","value":[" If you have a serious accident or even die, they should help to ensure you can receive suitable medical attention or repatriation.  They will not pay the costs of these services."]},{"type":"*","value":[" In the event of unexpected war or very serious civil disorder, embassies may arrange evacuation flights for their own citizens and any others they have responsibility for."]},{"type":"*","value":[" If you are jailed, they may visit and might provide a list of reputable lawyers that can speak your own language, but they are unlikely to provide a lawyer, pay for one or post bail. Whether they will bring any pressure on the host government to release you or treat you well is largely a political question. Be aware of limitations on what they can do for people with dual nationality (see ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Passport"]]},").  If you are accused of something where supporting you might make them look bad, they almost certainly will not take the risk; both civil servants and politicians tend to consider covering their own butts high on any priority list."]},"\nOne place where they may be able to help is if someone takes your passport for any reason except visa processing, for example an employer who wants it \"for safekeeping\" or a rent-a-whatever place that requires it \"as security\". This is not allowed under international law and, at least in theory, your consulate can pressure the host government who have no choice but to lean hard on local law enforcement to ensure you promptly get it back. Of course, that is only in theory; in some countries it may be quite different in practice.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Registering "]},"\n\nMost nations have some system that lets a citizen who is abroad long-term register so that their home government has a record of their presence. For many countries, you can do this online but for some you may need to actually visit a consulate. Registration is generally not recommended for tourists, but it is for expatriates and overseas students.\n\nRegistering will usually get you on a mailing list that brings notifications from your government; these are sometimes rather boring but some are useful or interesting. This can be very important in some circumstances; for example if a war or epidemic breaks out, your country's mission may be the best source of information and aid. Registering can also be very useful if you need services from the home country, for example being able to vote in an election back home or wanting to ensure that your health insurance there remains valid.\n\nAlso, the missions give fine parties and may invite any citizens who are about. Diplomats tend to live rather well, with good stocks of booze and excellent cooks. Of course, most of their parties are only for other diplomats, local government officials and other important people; the average traveller will not be invited, though a visiting business person or journalist might be. However, they also host celebrations on their national day or other important holidays — for example, Christmas or Thanksgiving for Americans — and almost anyone with the right passport can be invited to those. If you are abroad at such a time, it is certainly worth asking. An oddity about this is that the more out-of-the-way the place is, the better your chances are. An embassy in a major capital may already have its guest list filled, but one in Back-of-beyond-istan is very likely to welcome visitors.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Complications and variations "]},"\n\nThere are a number of complications and variations, which will only occasionally matter to travellers.\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Some of the smaller or poorer nations have few missions abroad. To get a visa for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tajikistan"]]},", for example, you may have to go to a major center like Moscow or London.  The bright side is that in these cases it's often possible to apply by mail, although this means letting go of your passport for several weeks."]},{"type":"*","value":[" The reverse can apply as well. If you are in Tajikistan and need consular assistance, your country may not have an embassy there so you might need to contact their nearest mission, perhaps in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kazakhstan"]]}," or even ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]},". Alternately, your government may have an arrangement with some friendly country by which that country's mission in Tajikistan will also provide consular service for citizens of your nation. This one more thing to check when planning a trip that goes far off the beaten path."]},{"type":"*","value":[" In some out-of-the-way places, the embassy or high commission of another country may have been designated to assist you. Australians may be directed to a Canadian embassy, or vice versa. A British embassy may assist citizens of another Commonwealth nation in some cases, or a European Union member nation may provide assistance to another EU member state's citizens."]},{"type":"*","value":[" An ",{"type":"'''","value":["honorary consul"]}," can be located anywhere and provides very limited consular services. Often the position is granted by a foreign government to a person with business interests in that location; they may not even be a citizen of the country they represent.

However, they are usually ",{"type":"''","value":["not"]}," authorized to grant visas or issue passports. "]},{"type":"*","value":[" Some countries' missions have a system of dividing the destination country up into zones and requesting or even requiring that people use the consulate for their zone. In China, for example, Canada will tell someone in Wuhan to use the Beijing embassy and someone in Fuzhou to use the Guangzhou consulate, even though the Shanghai consulate might be more convenient for both. Typically, this does not apply to tourists, only to people living in the country, but it does apply to both locals and expatriates."]},{"type":"*","value":[" In addition to embassies and consulates, there are diplomatic missions that use other names for various reasons:"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":[" A mission from a Commonwealth country to another is a ",{"type":"'''","value":["High Commission"]}," if in an embassy-like role and a ",{"type":"'''","value":["Deputy High Commission"]}," if only providing consular services."]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":[" A mission from a European Union country to another is a ",{"type":"'''","value":["Permanent Representation"]},"."]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":[" A mission from any country to the United Nations is a ",{"type":"'''","value":["Permanent Mission"]},"."]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":[" A mission representing a non-sovereign entity (such as a province or federated state) is a ",{"type":"'''","value":["delegation"]},"."]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":[" Countries that do not extend diplomatic recognition to each other may still have embassies in disguise.

During the Cold War, expelling a few dozen diplomats at a time for alleged spying was a common practice on both sides."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Diplomats' luggage or things shipped in a \"diplomatic bag\" are immune from customs inspection, though of course intelligence services are quite interested in them and routinely try various ways to sneak a look. There have also been instances where customs officials simply ignored this restriction; for example some decades back, the Shah of Iran's sister had her luggage searched at a Paris airport — even though she vigorously protested that the search was not allowed because she had diplomatic status — and several kilos of heroin turned up. Her diplomatic status kept her out of jail, but did not save the merchandise."]},"There are a set of rather complex rules covering how far these protections extend. Not all embassy staff may have diplomatic privileges but some staff outside the embassy — for example, at a trade mission or an aid agency — may. Some mission staff may have only a weaker \"consular immunity\"; they cannot be prosecuted for anything done on the job, but can be for other things. Employees of international organisations are covered by a separate and somewhat different set of rules.\n\nFor travellers, the simple rule is that unless you are an employee of your home government and travelling with a special diplomatic passport, or are a family member of someone who does, then diplomatic immunity doesn't apply to you. If you do have some official diplomatic status, then it becomes a more complex legal question. However, only a relatively few high-end diplomatic officials actually enjoy what is known as full diplomatic immunity.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See also"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Passport"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Visa"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinetopic"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["PartOfTopic"],["Concerns"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Diplomatic mission"]]}]
