Dire Dawa was founded in 1902 after the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway reached the area. The railroad could not reach the city of Harar at its higher elevation, so Dire Dawa was built nearby. It is a major hub for many ethnic groups in Ethiopia, especially the Afar, Oromo, and Somali.\n\nThe city is an industrial centre on the Dechatu River, and home to several markets.  It lies at the foot of a ring of cliffs that has been described as \"somewhat like a cluster of tea-leaves in the bottom of a slop-basin\".\n\nThere are two ATMs in the city at Dashen Bank and Ogaden Bank.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Aba Tenna D. Yilma International Airport"]}," is the second largest airport in Ethiopia. Ethiopian Airlines flies several times a day, as well as Air Djibouti and a few other smaller airlines of Middle Eastern countries. The unrecognized break-away Republic of Somaliland also has an airline that flies to Dire Dawa.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nDire Dawa is connected to Addis Ababa and the historical city of Harar by road, but fly or take train from Addis to get in to Dire Dawa.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nThere are three bus companies operating services linking Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa.  The cheapest, least comfortable and slowest is the government local bus service.  This can take anything from twelve to fifteen hours.  The most expensive is the Sky bus service, a luxury Chinese coach with toilets and a movie system, which takes around ten hours.  The Salem bus is a reasonable middle option, which is much quicker than the local service but still a bus rather than a coach.  Tickets for government buses are bought in the main bus station.  Sky bus tickets are sold from a discrete office in the Cornell area of town.  Salem bus tickets are purchased at the Samrat Hotel opposite the Ras.\n\nHarar is the other major destination.  Small mini buses leave whenever they are full from the main bus station and take about an hour.  It rarely takes longer than fifteen minutes for a minibus to be ready to leave.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nA twice-weekly train service from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Djibouti_(city)"],["Djibouti"]]}," have now resumed, however it's a grueling twenty hours journey.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe blue and white minibuses are in abundance in Dire Dawa, as well as the small blue taxis. The best way to get around is to use the minibuses or to contract the blue taxis for the duration of your stay. Most Dire Dawa taxi drivers don't have a sense of time, if you tell your contracted taxi driver to pick you up or drop you of at a certain time, expect him to be late an hour or two.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["The French-built train station can give you a 19th century feeling."]},{"type":"*","value":["At night and early in the morning, the Dechatu river basin has a heart warming sunset and sunrise scene."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nMost of the residents of the city chew the narcotic leaves known as \"Chat\" (aka qat, khat, ",{"type":"''","value":["catha edulis"]},"). In the afternoon, in many places, Dire Dawans sit in circle and consume khat, with several cups of coffee. During this time there could be a heated discussion. Avoid political topics, especially with the Ethiopian Somalis or Somali refugees. Other than that, you could have an interesting experience with the lightly narcotic drug. \nCaution:- \"Khat\" is illegal in most countries of the EU and the US.\n\nTwice yearly there is a religious ceremony at the nearby city of Kulubi (30 birr by minibus, 1 hour). It is a mass gathering with many small stalls selling clothes, sugar cane etc. Hotel prices in Dire Dawa double or triple for the three day period.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Learn"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Work"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nThere are two shops in town selling Harar coffee: Green and Gold is one.
