Its sister park ",{"type":"'''","value":["Disney California Adventure"]},", which opened in February 2001, is located across the entry plaza on the former site of Disneyland's parking lot. Both parks are divided into \"lands\", or themes. At the western end of the entry plaza is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Downtown Disney"]},", the shopping and entertainment district. The three hotels are located at the west end of Downtown Disney.\n\nThere is one main difference between the Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World, and that is in Anaheim, there are many non-Disney hotels, restaurants and shops just a short distance from the park's main entrance.\n\nDisneyland's rides are generally considered classic well-themed dark rides (e.g. Pirates of the Caribbean) with the occasional thrill ride (e.g. Space Mountain), while California Adventure's rides are more thrill-oriented (e.g. California Screamin') with some some family-style rides (e.g. Soarin' Over California). The Cast Members (employees) in all sections of the park are widely known to be very friendly and helpful. The attention to detail throughout the parks is extraordinary; however, most Cast Members will not know the history behind the details.\n\nThe two biggest problems with the Disneyland Resort as a whole are crowds and price. However with careful planning, both can be avoided.\n\nDisneyland is one of the most visited theme parks in the world (with 15.98 million visits in 2010, based on the TEA\/ERA figures, second only to the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Walt Disney World\/Magic Kingdom"],["Magic Kingdom"]]}," at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Walt Disney World"]]},"), so the parks can be pretty crowded, especially during the weekends, summer, and winter holidays, which leads to long lines for the most popular attractions. However, if you visit in the late winter or early spring, off-season lines can be short, especially during the weekdays. Disney California Adventure has fewer attractions but still has long lines, although not as long as Disneyland's attractions.\n\nEating outside the parks is quite possible due to the close vicinity of several restaurants to the park and the benefit of hand-stamp and re-entry. Stick to just snacks and maybe one meal in the park, and you can save some cash.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Disneyland overview map.PNG"],["thumb"],["350px"],["Map of the Disneyland Resort Complex"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Disneyland"]},{"type":"<","value":["br"]}," \n1313 South Harbor Boulevard",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\nAnaheim, CA 92802\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Disney California Adventure"]},{"type":"<","value":["br"]}," \n1620 South Disneyland Drive",{"type":"<","value":["br"]}," \nAnaheim, CA 92802\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nDisneyland is within driving distance of a number of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southern California"]]}," airports. Regardless of which airport you land at, it is always a good idea to consider available alternative forms of transportation before deciding to rent a car. Airport shuttles and public transit are an ideal option, especially if you are unfamiliar with the area. While LAX is the obvious choice and the most popular, there are a few other options which are calmer and sometimes even make for an easier arrival.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ocair.com\/ John Wayne Orange County Airport"]}]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["SNA"]]},") is one of the two closest airports to Anaheim.

Depending on where you are flying from it's one of the easiest ways to get to Disneyland. Although there is no direct bus service from the airport to the resort, depending on the number of people in your party it may be less expensive to rent a car in any case. Interestingly, if you take the main exit from the airport, which is East Wardlow Road, eventually it becomes Ball Road, which runs directly across the north edge of Disneyland itself.

The Disneyland Resort offers ample parking both for day visitors to the park as well as hotel guests. All of the surrounding hotels offer parking, but some clearly do not have sufficient parking for the number of overnight guests.\n\nDriving to the Disneyland Resort also means braving the Southern California traffic, which at times can be overwhelming. The Disneyland website offers ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/disneyland.disney.go.com\/disneyland\/en_US\/transportation\/landing?name=GettingToTheResortPage driving directions"]},", as do most online map sites. Traveling from the Long Beach Airport to the Disneyland Resort can be done using surface streets instead of freeways, which can be very crowded during commute hours.\n\nThe Disneyland Resort is bounded by Katella Avenue to the south, Ball Road to the north, Walnut Street to the west, Harbor Boulevard to the east, and the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5) on the northeast corner. The Anaheim Convention Center is located south of the resort across Katella Avenue.\n\nParking at the theme parks is $17 for car\/motorcycle, $22 for RV\/oversized vehicles, and $27 for bus\/tractor trailers. Parking at Downtown Disney is free for the first three hours and $6 for each additional hour afterwards, charged in increments of $2 every 20 minutes. Valet parking is available at Downtown Disney for $6 extra from 5PM-2AM. For hotel guests, self parking $15 per night for up to 2 vehicles, with valet parking available at $22 per night per vehicle. A pick-up\/drop-off area for the theme parks is on the west side of Harbor Boulevard north of Disney Way, past the shuttle area.\n\nIf you are arriving in Anaheim by train, a taxi is a reasonable option to get to the resort from the station. A one-way taxi ride from either the Anaheim or Fullerton Train Station is around $15 plus tip to the Anaheim Resort area. Taxis serve the hotels and a taxi stand at Downtown Disney near the Rainforest Café, on the south side of the North Self-Park Lot.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By foot"]},"\nOne of the great advantages at the Disneyland Resort is that Disneyland Park, Disney California Adventure Park, Downtown Disney, and many \"off property\" hotels are all within walking distance.  Unlike Walt Disney World in Florida, guests can walk between Disneyland Park, Disney California Adventure Park, and Downtown Disney in just a minute or two.  There are approximately 12 \"off property\" hotels that are within a 10 minute walk.  Some experienced visitors to the Disneyland Resort stay at the walking-distance hotels and find it more convenient to not have a car.  It only takes five to 10 minutes to walk to the Disneyland entrance from a walking-distance hotel, and taking breaks in the middle of the day is much more convenient.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By transit"]},"\n\nLocal trains and buses are the cheapest ways to get to the park.

That same bus will take you back to the station for free from 3:30PM-6PM. There is no service on weekends. Other than these times Route 50, which runs from Cal State University Long Beach to The Village at Orange, services the station by using Katella Avenue about every 30 min (though you will have to walk about 10 min down Harbor Blvd if you pick this bus). Other OCTA routes servicing the park but not the station are Route 43 (Harbor Blvd.), which runs from La Habra to Downtown Newport Beach about every 20 min; Route 46 (Ball Rd.), which runs between Los Alamitos and The Village at Orange; and Route 83 (Santa Ana Freeway), which goes from the Laguna Hills Mall to the Disneyland Resort, by way of Santa Ana. The last four routes cost $1.50 per boarding.\n\nLos Angeles County MTA Route 460 links Disneyland with Fullerton, Buena Park (with a stop at Knott's Berry Farm), Norwalk, and downtown LA.\n\nIf you are staying at the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.knottshotel.com\/ Knott's Berry Farm Resort Hotel"]}," in nearby ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Buena Park"]]},", you can take advantage of the free Disneyland shuttle.\n\nThe City of Anaheim runs a ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.rideart.org\/ tourist bus service"]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Tickets"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["Warning: Purchasing tickets online"],["Many tickets sold online through auction websites such as eBay or Craigslist are partially used multi-day park-hopper tickets.

Multi-day Park Hopper tickets do not have to be used on consecutive days, but will expire 14 days after the first day they are used, or January 13, 2015, whichever occurs first.

All 3, 4, or 5 day tickets come with Magic Morning, which provides access into one park an hour before general opening one time during the ticket validity period.
