There are quite frequent trains between Ljubljana and Sezana (on the Italian border) but trains through to Trieste are less frequent.  If travelling from Trieste or elsewhere in Italy it's best to take a bus from Trieste to Sezana (about 20 minutes, 1 euro) and then a connecting train to Divača.  Hikers or those who fancy a walk could simply to a bus to Bazovica in Italy and walk from there (about 7km).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nDivača is on the main A1 highway between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ljubljana"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Koper"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe Škocjan caves are about 4km from the town center and railway station.  There is no regular public transport, but there is a spottily signposted footpath (35 min) connecting the two, or you can try to hitch a bus ride to the highway A1 exit near the caves.  During the summer months it is possible to hire bicycles from a store near Divača train station which will allow you easy access to the caves and other areas in this part of Slovenia and Italy.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThere are several ",{"type":"'''","value":["caves"]}," in the area.

To get there by car, take the Divača exit from the highway and follow the signs. \n\nThe park's main attraction is its cave system that includes the highest cave hall in Europe, a massive gorge, waterfalls and a bridge over the gorge that looks like something out of The Lord of the Rings.  The caves have beautiful stalactite and stalagmite structures.  All told, there are eleven chambers that stretch for about six kilometers and the landscape was considered so unique that the caves are listed as a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["UNESCO World Heritage Site"]]},".  \n\nAdmission to the caves is by tour only, an easy guided walk that lasts about 90 minutes and takes you through two chambers:  the Silent Cave and the Murmuring Cave.  It's a good idea to bring decent shoes, wear a light coat (it's chilly and drippy inside) and be prepared to walk up and down hills.  Tour costs €14\/10\/6 (adult\/seniors and students\/children).\n\nAlso of interest is the river Reka, which flows straight into Škocjan Caves and disappears into the cave tunnels, only to resurface some 20 km west near the Adriatic Sea. They are a further 20 minutes west from Postojna Caves.\n\nPhotography is technically forbidden, so if you want to take photos, stay toward the end of the tour where the guide can't see you, and carry a camera that you can sneak in stealthily.
