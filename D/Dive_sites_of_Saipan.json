After a giant stride into the water from a rock in the cavern, divers can take three different exit holes out to open ocean. Once outside, there are beautiful walls, swim-throughs, and caves to explore. Turtles and Clown Triggerfish are some of the many types of sea life to be seen at this magnificent dive site. Several resident White Tip Sharks lounge on the bottom during the day.\n\nThis site is one of the four divesites most frequently visited by professional dive shops on Saipan. Because of its difficulty, it is typically used only for divers who have already been certified, though on rare rough-weather occasions when all other sites are undivable, open water students and even introductory divers are brought here.\n\n\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Topography:"]}," — The Grotto is possibly the most popular and most challenging dive in Saipan. It is a natural tunnel leading from the top of a high cliff down below sea level, then exiting into open ocean through three wide openings at depths between 0~60ft.\/0~18m. Outside the openings, the cliff descends far beyond the depths of recreational diving, but allows for easy drift-diving along the cliff wall. To the left (southwest) of the openings, along the cliff face at 40~50ft. deep is a large divable underwater cavern known informally as \"the batcave\".  (Divers should not attempt to reach the batcave without a local guide, and only if their air consumption rate is quite slow.)\n\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Conditions:"]}," —\nVisibility here is quite possibly the best Saipan has to offer, typically exceeding 90ft.\/30m. \n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"''","value":["Shore dive"]}," — Access is via a well-paved asphalt road from San Roque to a parking lot atop the cliff, then down 112 cement steps to a sunlit large natural rock in the cave lagoon. From this rock divers make a giant-stride entry into 15ft.\/5m of water and hold onto a mooring buoy until all the members of their group are in the water.  \n\nExit is also via this rock, and accomplished by holding onto the mooring buoy rope while swinging onto a sea-level ledge on the entry\/exit rock.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Marine life:"]}," — Typical natural life in and around the Grotto includes 1~3 harmless white-tip reef sharks,  bubble coral and lace coral (in the batcave), a small group of barracuda, and pyramid butterfly fish. Occasional fauna include green sea turtles, Napoleon wrasses, tuna, and spotted eagle rays.\n\nCoral growth is slight.\n\n\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Hazards:"]}," — Because of the physically demanding 112-step staircase, beach divers visiting this site should be in good physical condition. There are occasional boat-dives outside the Grotto, but distance from the harbor and the ease of beach entry make this an uncommon boat dive.\n\nSnorkelers and swimmers should avoid exiting the Grotto even under the calmest conditions, since exiting at or near the surface is sometimes easy but reentry can often be impossible because of strong currents, whitewater waves crashing against the cliff, and extremely sharp rocks. Once outside the Grotto, the nearest surface-exit points are the far-away Bird Island to the northeast and equally distant Wing Beach to the southwest. It's therefore imperative that divers retain enough air to return underwater and make their safety-stop within the Grotto. \n\n\n\n\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Wing Beach"]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["Understand:"]},"\nWing beach is the beach\/boat dive closest to The Grotto. Access is via a very poor dirt road, then to a small jungle clearing near the far northeast side of Wing Beach. From there, beach divers walk across a white pebble beach and follow the northeast rocky wall of the beach down a flat rocky slope, then follow the underwater wall around further to the northeast. Exit is by the same route. \nThis site is not commonly visited by professional dive shops.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Position"]}," — Wing Beach is located on the northwest part of the island.\n\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Topography:"]}," — There are some great geographical features here, such as large crevices and breathtaking drop-offs.

The two locations are separate, with extremely different beach and water conditions.\n\nTanapag is possibly the easiest, most convenient, safest introductory dive site on Saipan. \n\nControversially, professional dive leaders will often bring canned and plastic-wrapped hot dogs underwater so that customers can enjoy feeding the fish, who will flock around the diver in large numbers. While this is undoubtedly thrilling for the diver, the unnatural food source leads to health problems for the fishes and the cans\/wrapping are often abandoned underwater, polluting the area.\n\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Depth:"]}," — 0~15ft.\/5m \n\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Conditions:"]}," — Moderate 30ft.\/10m visibility.

From there, divers typically sit around the edges of the theater on low walls, listening to dive instructions and arranging their gear. Next, divers enter the water via an extremely gently sloping sand beach and practice their dive-training in water where they can stand up. Then the divers proceed into deeper water along a submerged anchored rope.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Marine life:"]}," — small coral outcroppings surrounded by small reef fishes, sea cucumbers, small boxfish, clownfish, pufferfish, and occasional scorpionfish.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Photography:"]}," — This is an ideal site for using an inexpensive snorkeling camera without flash to take underwater photos, since the area is well lit and depths are within snorkeling-camera depths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["The Korean\/Japanese Troop Ship"]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["Understand:"]},"\nThis World War Two troop ship was owned by the Japanese, but sank while carrying conscripted Korean soldiers.

As with much of Saipan's beaches, shallow waters, and jungles, Obyan's underwater sandy regions and the nearby jungle area still give up occasional artillery fired from American warships and from the pillbox. If you see one, do not touch it, as roughly a third of the undetonated armaments are still capable of explosive reactions to mishandling.\n\nSnorkelers should be cautioned to stay in the yard-deep lagoon inside the wave-break zone, because although moving out into deeper water through the coral cuts is easy at the surface, return is not — the waves break in extremely shallow sharp corals, and the coral cuts experience strong outgoing rip-tides.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Skills:"]}," — This dive site is ideal for all skill levels, especially people interested in photography. \n\n\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Lau Lau Beach"]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["Understand:"]},"\nThis is one of Saipan's most frequently visited sites, and is an ideal dive site for beginners or people interested in smaller, more colorful animals.\n\n\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Topography:"]}," — one of the largest reefs on the island\n\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"''","value":["Shore dive"]}," — easy beach entry \n",{"type":"====","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Marine life:"]}," — Wrasses, butterfly fish, surgeons, Big eye skad, snappers, and more.
