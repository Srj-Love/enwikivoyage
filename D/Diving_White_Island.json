It was named 'White Island' by Captain Cook on October 1, 1769 because it always appeared to be in a cloud. \n\nWhite Island is in the Bay of Plenty, about 48 km (30 mi) from the coast. The nearest mainland towns are Whakatane and Tauranga. It is one of the most accessible active volcanos on earth, attracting scientists, volcanologists and tourists.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["General topography"]},"\nWhite Island is an active andesite stratovolcano. It is New Zealand’s most active cone volcano, and only active marine volcano, and has been built up by continuous volcanic activity over the past 150,000 years. The eruptions have produced both lava flows and explosive eruptions of ash. \n\nThe island is roughly circular, about 2 km (1.2 mi) in diameter, and rises to a height of 321 m (1,053 ft) above sea level. However this is only the peak of a much larger submarine mountain, which rises up to 1,600 m (5,249 ft) above the nearby seafloor, making the largest volcanic structure in New Zealand.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate, weather and sea conditions"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Marine ecology"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Equipment"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Dive sites"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:White Island and Volkner Rocks dive map.png"],["thumb"],["400px"],["Map of the dive sites at White Island and Volkner Rocks"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Respect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get help"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Emergency services"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content= Police."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content= Ambulance service"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content= Sea rescue"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content= Recompression chamber"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content= DAN hotline"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get service"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Do"]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nWhite Island is privately owned and was declared a private scenic reserve in 1953.
