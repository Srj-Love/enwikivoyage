Rainfall is heavy along the coast and decreases in the north and south. Cyclones are common during the wet season.\n\nThe sea temperature is tropical. Water temperatures range from 29˚C in summer to 22˚C in winter, and will seldom be below 24˚C. Diving is year round. People from cooler climates may find winter more comfortable, and there are fewer mosquitos as this is the dry season.\n\nVisibility can range from 8–40 m, depending on the amount of plankton in the water.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Marine ecology"]},"\n\nThe marine ecology of Mozambique is classified as Tropical Indo-Pacific, which is the most diverse marine ecology known. Obviously not all species from this bioregion will be found in all parts of it, but this is an indication of the diversity which can be expected here. A wide range of reef building corals, and also other coral types can be found here, along with a diverse invertebrate fauna sharing the shelter and habitat provided by the corals. Fish are also represented by a large diversity of species, many of which are particularly colourful.\n\nHumpback whales can be spotted during their migration from June until November.\n\nWhale sharks are present all year round and in abundance between November and March. These gentle\ngiants can reach up to 12m in length and weigh up to 20tonnes.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Equipment"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Respect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nPick up's can be arranged through lodges, dive centres etc. But there is ample public transport and it is safe and easy to walk to most places in the area.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Dive sites"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Southern Mozambique"]},"\nSouthern ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mozambique"]]}," includes the ",{"type":"''","value":["Municipios"]}," of ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Maputo (region)"],["Maputo"]]}]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Gaza (region)"],["Gaza"]]}]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Inhambane (region)"],["Inhambane"]]}]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Sofala (Region)"],["Sofala"]]}]}," from the southern border with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South Africa"]]}," at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ponta d'Ouro"]]},"  north to the Zambesi river.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Ponta do Ouro to Ponta Mamoli"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Dive sites include:"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["G-Spot"]},{"type":"*","value":["Fish Basket"]},{"type":"*","value":["Pinnacles"]},{"type":"*","value":["Bass City"]},{"type":"*","value":["Kev's Ledge"]},{"type":"*","value":["Wayne's World"]},{"type":"*","value":["Aquarium"]},{"type":"*","value":["Three Sisters"]},{"type":"*","value":["Doodles"]},{"type":"*","value":["Mavericks"]},{"type":"*","value":["Texas"]},{"type":"*","value":["Shallow Malongane"]},{"type":"*","value":["Paradise Ledge"]},{"type":"*","value":["Chesckers"]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["Manta Coast"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Dive sites include:"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Amazon"]},{"type":"*","value":["Arcadia"]},{"type":"*","value":["Area 51"]},{"type":"*","value":["Barra Lagoon\/Estuary"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Diving in Mozambique\/Batfish Pinnacle"],["Batfish Pinnacle"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":["Buddies Reef"]},{"type":"*","value":["Deep Reef South"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Diving in Mozambique\/Devils Peak"],["Devil's Peak"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Diving in Mozambique\/Disneyland"],["Disneyland"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Diving in Mozambique\/Greentree Reef"],["Greentree Reef"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Diving in Mozambique\/Hard Rock"],["Hard Rock"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Diving in Mozambique\/Island Rock"],["Island Rock"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":["Kitwe"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Diving in Mozambique\/Manta Reef"],["Manta Reef"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Diving in Mozambique\/North Greentree"],["North Greentree"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":["The \"Klipfontein\" wreck"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Diving in Mozambique\/The Office"],["The Office"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Diving in Mozambique\/Paindane Coral Garden"],["Paindane Coral Garden"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Diving in Mozambique\/Paindane Express"],["Paindane Express"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Diving in Mozambique\/Pao Reef"],["Pao Reef"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":["Playstation"]},{"type":"*","value":["Pomene Estuary"]},{"type":"*","value":["Salon"]},{"type":"*","value":["Three Sisters"]},{"type":"*","value":["Trojan Wall"]},{"type":"*","value":["Witch's Hat"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Diving in Mozambique\/Xstacy Reef"],["Xstacy Reef (XTC)"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"=====","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Tofo Beach"]]}]},"\nNice coral but known more for its abundance of manta rays, reef sharks, whale sharks and humpback whales.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Liquid Adventures"],["url=http:\/\/www.divingtofo.com"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+258 845363636"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=They are a PADI dive centre offering all courses from Open Water through to Assistant Instructor and also offer various other watersport activities."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"=====","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Guinjata Bay"]]}]},"\nA small bay just south of Inhambane on a long stretch of sandy coastline.
