The main North and South Islands are separated by the Cook Strait, 22 kilometres (14 mi) wide at its narrowest point.\n\nBesides the North and South Islands, the five largest inhabited islands are Stewart Island, Chatham Island, Great Barrier Island (in the Hauraki Gulf), d'Urville Island (in the Marlborough Sounds) and Waiheke Island (about 22 km (14 mi) from central Auckland). The country's islands lie between latitudes 29° and 53°S, and longitudes 165° and 176°E.\n\nThe two main islands of New Zealand measure over 1,600 kilometres (990 mi) long from north to south, and narrow (a maximum width of 400 km (250 mi)), with approximately 15,134 km (9,404 mi) of coastline for a land area of 268,021 square kilometres (103,483 sq mi).\n\nThe South Island is the largest land mass of New Zealand and is divided along its length by the Southern Alps. Fiordland in the south west has steep mountains and deep fiords from the extensive ice age glaciation. The North Island is less mountainous but is more  volcanically active.\n\nThe long coastline with many bays and peninsulas, and the many islands, provides a setting for a very large number of dive sites, in a wide variety of geographical environments.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate, weather and sea conditions"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Ocean circulation near New Zealand.tif"],["thumb"],["Ocean currents around new Zealand"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:New Zealand Marine Weather Regions Map.png"],["thumb"],["Map showing the New Zealand coastal and offshore weather regions"]]},"\nNew Zealand is positioned across the division between subantarctic and subtropical water masses, and this provides a large range of conditions and habitats which support a wide diversity of marine life.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Climate"]},"\nNew Zealand has a mild and temperate maritime climate with mean annual temperatures ranging from 10°C (50°F) in the south to 16°C (61°F) in the north.\n\nConditions between regions vary from extremely wet on the West Coast of the South Island to relatively dry in Central Otago and the Mackenzie basin of inland Canterbury and subtropical in Northland. Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch all receive a yearly average in excess of 2,000 hours of sunshine. The southern and south-western parts of the South Island have a cooler and cloudier climate, with around 1,400–1,600 hours; the northern and north-eastern parts of the South Island are the sunniest areas of the country and receive approximately 2,400–2,500 hours.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Weather"]},"\nThe weather is notoriously variable. The expression ",{"type":"''","value":["Four seasons in one day"]}," sums it up quite well.\n\nMarine weather forecasts are available on-line from ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.metservice.com\/marine\/coastal\/index Metservice"]}," for each of the marine weather regions. These forecasts are updated daily or more frequently, and provide wind and sea state predictions from the government meteorological service. Predictions are fairly reliable for the day of announcement and the following day, and include reasonable predictions for the following three days. Gale and storm warnings, and small craft advisories are provided. The forecasts are also broadcast on VHF and can be received offshore in the relevant regions except for a few dead spots behind islands.\n",{"type":"''","value":["Nowcasting"]}," services are also provided on VHF in some areas, which give continuous reports on wind at selected meteorological stations, and repeated forecasts of local conditions and tides. These forecasts are of great value for dive planning particularly for the offshore sites which require fairly long boat trips.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Marine ecology"]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["Habitat types"]},"\nSeveral habitat types can be categorised by the physical environment. These range from soft sediment based habitats which include silts and muds in protected bays, coarse sands and gravels, pebbles and shell on exposed shorelines, biogenic reefs, formed by a variety of organisms, and rocky reefs.\n",{"type":"===","value":["Equipment"]},"\nThe majority of dive sites in New Zealand can be dived using conventional recreational scuba equipment. Dives which are beyond ordinary recreational limits due to depth overhead or current can generally be satisfactorily handled using the appropriate equipment and skills.\n\nWater temperatures are generally temperate to cold, and the use of drysuits is recommended for colder waters in winter or in those places where the water is not significantly warmer in summer.\nWater temperatures of 14°C are common in winter and spring even in the northern regions of the North Island.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Diving destinations"]},"\nDestinations listed here are listed by association with the North or South Island, and in geographically convenient regions which should be familiar to locals.\n\nOffshore islands are grouped with the closest appropriate mainland region.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["North Island"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:NZ north island regions.png"],["thumb"],["Geographic regions of North Island"]]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["Northland"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Hen and Chicken Islands looking south east PA232375.JPG"],["thumb"],["View of the Hen and Chicken Islands looking south east"]]},"\nMarine weather area ",{"type":"''","value":["Kaipara"]}," (North Cape to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Muriwai"]]},", mostly west coast.)\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Diving at Three Kings Islands"],["Three Kings Islands"]]}," — A small group of uninhabited offshore islands to the far north of North Island."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Diving North Cape"],["North Cape"]]}," — The northernmost point of the mainland"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Diving Cape Karikari"],["Cape Karikari"]]}]},"Marine weather area ",{"type":"''","value":["Brett"]}," (North Cape to Bream Head, east coast)\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Bream Head NZ from the south PA131535.JPG"],["thumb"],["Bream Head seen from the south"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Diving Berghan Point"],["Berghan Point"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Diving Whangaroa"],["Whangaroa"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Diving the Cavalli Islands"],["Cavalli Islands"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Diving the Purerua Peninsula"],["Purerua Peninsula"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Diving the Bay of Islands"],["Bay of Islands"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Diving Cape Brett"],["Cape Brett"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Diving Whangamumu"],["Whangamumu"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Diving Mimiwhangata"],["Mimiwhangata"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Diving the Poor Knights Islands"],["Poor Knights Islands"]]},": A marine reserve around a group of small uninhabited volcanic islands 24 km off the north east coast of New Zealand, at 25°28' S, 174° 33' E."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Diving Tutukaka"],["Tutukaka"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Diving the Hen and Chicken Islands"],["Hen and Chicken Islands"]]}," — A group of small uninhabited islands off the east coast of Northland."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Diving Whangarei"],["Whangarei"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Diving the Mokohinau Islands"],["Mokohinau Islands"]]}," — A group of small uninhabited islands off the east coast of Northland."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Diving Bream Bay"],["Bream Bay"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["Auckland and the Hauraki Gulf"]},"\nMarine weather area ",{"type":"''","value":["Colville"]}," (Bream Head to Great Mercury Island)\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Diving the Great Barrier Island"],["Great Barrier Island"]]}," — This large inhabited island is the north eastern limit of the Hauraki Gulf.
