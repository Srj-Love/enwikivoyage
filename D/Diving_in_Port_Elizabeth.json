The bay is bounded in the west by Cape Recife and in the east by Cape Padrone, and much of the shoreline is sandy beaches.  The greter metropolitan area extends some distance to the west of Cape Recife, and this rocky part of the coastline includes a number of the most popular dive sites.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate, Weather and Sea conditions"]},"\n\"The Windy City\" has a subtropical climate with light rain throughout the year. The area lies between the winter rainfall, Mediterranean climate zones of the Western Cape and the summer rainfall regions of eastern South Africa. The proximity to the ocean has a moderating effect on the climate, so winters are cool but mild and summers are warm but considerably less humid and hot than more northerly parts of South Africa's east coast. Jan Max: 25 °C, Min: 18 °C; Jul Max: 20 °C, Min: 9 °C\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["The Marine Ecology"]},"\nPort Elizabeth is within the warm temperate Agulhas bioregion, which extends from Cape Point to the Mbashe River. It is some 360km from Mbashe mouth and 660km from Cape Point, so is somewhat towards the warmer side of the region. Upwelling on the south coast of South Africa is largely driven by the Agulhas current and the continental shelf. This form of upwelling forces cold deep water up onto the continental shelf, but not necessarily above the thermocline. In the region east of the Agulhas bank, wind enhanced upwelling, occurring mainly in summer, augments the current driven upwelling bringing the colder deeper waters to the surface. This enhances biological productivity by supply of nutrients to the euphotic zone (where plants have sufficient light to flourish) which fuels phytoplankton production, and rocky shores that are supplied with the nutrient rich water support rich algal biomass. The annual chokka spawning takes place largely in this region. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Equipment"]},"\n\nNo special equipment is required for most of the sites. Wet or semi-dry suits will be adequate for most divers most of the time, though for those who wish to do multiple dives of longer duration, or are sensitive to the cold, a dry suit is recommended.\nIf you intend to dive autonomously, rather than follow thr divemaster, a DSMB (Delayed\/deployable Surface Marker Buoy) and reel or spool is recommended, so the boat will know where you are surfacing, particularly if there is a current running. This will also help alert other vessels of your proximity to the surface so they can avoid you in time.\n\nNitrox is available at some filling stations, but your choice of mix may be limited.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Respect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get help"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Emergency services"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content= Police."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content= Ambulance service"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=National Sea Rescue Institute.

Several boats make strictly scheduled launches several times per day depending on conditions, and dives are generally limited to 30 minutes to allow schedules to be kept.\n\nDive operators and other sponsors from Port Elizabeth and surrounding areas support this festival of diving which was started in 1999 and has grown to be the best known and probably largest event of its kind in South Africa.   The organisors and crew are all unpaid volunteers, and the takings go to charities: deposits are not refundable.\n\nThe festival is well organised, but can be disrupted by adverse weather conditions.\n\nFeatures offered include:\n",{"type":"*","value":["Dives on about 9 different dive sites with maximum depths from 10 to 26 meters."]},{"type":"*","value":["Colourful reefs with hard and soft coral and a wide range of other organisms."]},{"type":"*","value":["On site tank refills, basic equipment hire, shuttle service from parking area...and secure parking."]},{"type":"*","value":["Online booking and payment."]},{"type":"*","value":["Stalls with leading brands of dive gear for sale."]},{"type":"*","value":["Refreshment stalls and bar facilities."]},{"type":"*","value":["Ablution facilities with showers."]},{"type":"*","value":["Lucky draws and prizes every day (your dive booking tickets go into the draw)."]},{"type":"*","value":["On site entertainment sideshows.
