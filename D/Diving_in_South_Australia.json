It is bordered to the west by Western Australia, to the north by the Northern Territory, to the north-east by Queensland, to the east by New South Wales, to the south-east by Victoria, and to the south by the Great Australian Bight and the Indian Ocean. Most of the people live in the state capital, Adelaide, with most of the remainder settled in fertile areas along the south-eastern coast and River Murray. \n\nSouth Australia is known as a state of festivals and of fine wine. The state's economy centres on the agricultural, manufacturing and mining industries.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["General topography"]},"\n\nAccording to Australian maps, South Australia's south coast is on the Southern Ocean, but official international consensus defines the Southern Ocean as extending north of Antarctica only as far as 60°S or 55°S, at least 17 degrees of latitude short of the southernmost point of South Australia, so the coast is technically on the Indian Ocean.  However, please note that most South Australians use the term 'Southern Ocean'.\n\nThe coastline includes cliffs along the Great Australian Bight and the western side of Eyre Peninsula, but is less rugged on Spencer Gulf and Gulf St Vincent,  Yorke Peninsula, Fleurieu Peninsula, Encounter Bay and The Coorong.\n\nKangaroo Island which is Australia's third largest island, lies off the centre of the state's coast.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate, weather and sea conditions"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Marine forecast areas of South Australia.png"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Map showing the marine weather forecast areas of South Australia"]]},"\nThe northern part of the state has arid or semi-arid climate. \n\nThe southern coastal part of the state, from the Eyre peninsula and Spencer gulf southwards has a Mediterranean climate with mild wet winters and hot dry summers. South Australia's main temperature range is 29°C in January to 15°C in July. Most of the rain in the southern districts falls during winter when the sub-tropical high-pressure belt is displaced to the north over the continent.\n\nThe Great South Australian Coastal Upwelling System is Australia's only deep-reaching coastal upwelling system, bringing nutrient-rich water up from depths exceeding 300 m. It is a seasonal system which extends from Ceduna in the eastern Great Australian Bight, to Portland in Victoria,  a distance of about 800 km. The upwelling events usually occur in summer, from December to April, driven by southeasterly coastal winds. \n\nMajor upwelling occurs along the southern tip of the Eyre Peninsula, and less pronounced upwelling off the south-western coast of Kangaroo Island.\n\nThere are several coastal marine weather forecast areas in South Australia:\n",{"type":"*","value":["Far west coast"]},{"type":"*","value":["Upper west coast"]},{"type":"*","value":["Lower west coast"]},{"type":"*","value":["Central coast"]},{"type":"*","value":["Spencer gulf"]},{"type":"*","value":["Investigator strait"]},{"type":"*","value":["Gulf st Vincent"]},{"type":"*","value":["Adelaide metropolitan waters"]},{"type":"*","value":["South central coast"]},{"type":"*","value":["Upper south east coast"]},{"type":"*","value":["Lower south east coast"]},"\nMarine weather forecasts available from:\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.bom.gov.au\/sa\/forecasts\/index.shtml Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.weatherzone.com.au\/marine\/sa Weatherzone"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.buoyweather.com\/wxnav6.jsp?region=AS&program=Maps Buoyweather"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.seabreeze.com.au\/graphs\/sa.asp Seabreeze"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/wind.willyweather.com.au\/sa WillyWeather"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/weather.ninemsn.com.au\/marine\/sa?d=1 9news weather"]}]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Marine ecology"]},"\nThe coastal waters are classified as temperate, and have a corresponding ecology, which includes a significant number of endemic species of interest to the recreational diver.\n\nThe nutrient-rich water from the upwelling has an important role in the life cycle of juvenile southern bluefin tuna which aggregate and feed on pilchards in the eastern Bight during the upwelling season. Colonies of sea lions, little penguins and seals, and the locally high abundance of blue whales and sharks are supported by the upwelling system.\n\nThe Great South Australian Coastal Upwelling System and its ecosystem can be regarded as one of Australia's natural wonders.\n\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Dive Sites"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Gulf St Vincent east coast (including ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Adelaide"]]},")"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Dive sites of the Gulf St Vincent east coast.png"],["thumb"],["Map showing the positions of dive sites on the east coast of the Gulf St Vincent"]]},"\nTop of Gulf St Vincent (S-34°133',E138°086') to North of Sellicks Beach (S35°20').\n;Marine weather forecast areas:\n",{"type":"*","value":["Gulf St Vincent"]},{"type":"*","value":["Adelaide metropolitan waters"]},"\n;Dive sites include:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"''","value":["John Robb"]},":  S 34°49.434', E 138°20.190' "]},":Wreck dive.
