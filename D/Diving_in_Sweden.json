They probably thought that they would have time to light them up if another ship came into sight. Only one person survived out of about twenty people in the crew.\n:The Swedish cargo ship SS Bergvik was entering Dalarö when the pilot noticed a white light, which he believed was a vessel at anchor. When Bergvik got closer they also saw a faint red glow. Eventually they realised that it must be a ship under way and there was a risk of collision. The captain ordered full astern, but it was too late. and the Bergvik's bow penetrated three feet into the side of the Ingrid Horn, which sank fast.
