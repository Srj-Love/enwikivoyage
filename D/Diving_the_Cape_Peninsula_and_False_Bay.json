The northern border is the coast of Table Bay, a large open bay with a single island, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Robben Island"]]},", in its mouth. \n\nA ragged coastline marks the western border along the Atlantic ocean. A number of small bays are found along the coast with a single large one, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hout Bay"]]},", about half way along. Further south the peninsula narrows until it comes to an end at Cape Point. A range of mountains with Table Mountain at 1,085m at the northern end forms the backbone of the peninsula. The highest point of the southern peninsula is Swartkop, at 678m, near Simon’s Town.\n\nThe eastern side is bordered by False Bay, and this stretch of coastline includes the smaller Smitswinkel Bay, Simon’s Bay and Fish Hoek Bay. At Muizenberg the coastline becomes relatively low and sandy and curves east to Gordon’s Bay to form the northern boundary of False Bay. From ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gordon's Bay"]]}," the coastline swings roughly south, and zig-zags its way along the foot of the Hottentot’s Holland mountain range to Cape Hangklip which is at nearly the same latitude as Cape Point. The highest peak on this side is Kogelberg at 1,269m. \n\nIn plan the bay is approximately square with rather wobbly edges, being roughly the same extent from north to south as east to west (30 km), with the entire southern side open to the ocean.\nThe area of False Bay has been measured at about 1,090km², and the volume is approximately 45km³ (average depth about 40m). The land perimeter has been measured at 116 km, from a 1:50,000 scale map.\n\nThe bottom morphology of False Bay is generally smooth and fairly shallow, sloping gently downwards from North to South, so that the depth at the centre of the mouth is about 80m. The bottom is covered with sediment which ranges from very coarse to very fine, with most of the fine sediment and mud in the centre of the bay. The main exception is a long ridge of sedimentary rock that extends in a southward direction from off the Strand, to approximately level with the mouth of the Steenbras River. The  southern tip of this ridge is known as Steenbras Deep.\n\nThere is one true island in the bay, Seal Island, a barren and stony outcrop of granite about 200m long and with an area of about 2 hectare. It is about 6 km south of Strandfontein and is less than 10m above sea level at its highest point. There are also a number of small rocky islets which extend above the high water mark, and other rocks and shoals which approach the surface. Most of these are granite of the ",{"type":"''","value":["Peninsula"]}," pluton, but east of Seal Island they are generally sandstone, probably of the ",{"type":"''","value":["Table Mountain"]}," series, though it is possible that some may be of the underlying ",{"type":"''","value":["Tygerberg"]}," formation.\n\nOutside the bay, but influencing the wave patterns in it, is Rocky Bank, an extensive area of sandstone reef between 20 and 30m depth.\n\nStrictly speaking, False Bay is part of the Atlantic ocean which extends as far as Cape Agulhas, but when in Cape Town, Atlantic generally refers to the western seaboard of the Cape Peninsula, and the east side is referred to as False Bay, or the Simon's Town side. This convention will be used throughout this guide.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate, weather and sea conditions"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Climate of the Western Cape"]},"\nThe climate of the South-western Cape is markedly different from the rest of South Africa, which is a summer rainfall region, receiving most of its rainfall during the summer months of December to February. The South-western Cape has a Mediterranean type climate, with most of its rainfall during the winter months from June to September.\n\nDuring the summer the dominant factor determining the weather in the region is a high pressure zone, known as the Atlantic High, located over the South Atlantic ocean to the west of the Cape coast. Winds circulating in an anticlockwise direction from such a system reach the Cape from the south-east, producing periods of up to several days of high winds and clear skies. These south easterly winds are locally known as the Cape Doctor. They keep the region relatively cool and help to blow polluted air from the industrial areas and Cape Flats out to sea. Because of its south facing aspect False Bay is exposed to these winds, particularly on the west side, while Table Bay and the west coast of the peninsula experience an offshore wind. This wind pattern is locally influenced by the topography to the extent that gale force winds may be blowing in Gordon’s Bay, while about 10 km away parts of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Somerset West"]]}," may have a sweltering and windless day.\n\nWinter in the South-western Cape is characterised by disturbances in the circumpolar westerly winds, resulting in a series of eastward moving depressions. These bring cool cloudy weather and rain from the north west. The south westerly winds over the South Atlantic produce the prevailing south-westerly swell typical of the winter months, which beat on the exposed Atlantic coastline and the east side of False Bay. The mountains of the Cape Peninsula provide protection within the west side of False Bay from this wind and from the south westerly waves – a fact which influenced Governor Simon van der Stel in his choice of Simon’s Bay as a winter anchorage for the Dutch East India Company’s ships for Cape Town. The north westerly winter storms have wrecked many ships anchored in Table Bay over the centuries. Even today, in spite of technical advances and improved weather forecasting this still happens, though less frequently than in the past, and these days the salvage operations are more often successful.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Weather"]},"\nThere can be considerable variation in weather conditions between different sites in the area covered by this guide on any day, though the general tendency may be similar. For example rain may fall on the Cape Peninsula in the morning, and by afternoon these conditions may have moved over to the east side of False Bay and the peninsula may be clearing with a significant wind directional shift from north westerly to south westerly. The general trend is for the weather to come in from the west and move eastwards with the frontal systems, but there can also be more local weather phenomena such as thunderstorms (rare) and Berg winds, which are warm winds coming down off the mountains. Local variation in wind strength may be extreme, and sometimes hard to believe, as there may be a dead calm in one place and a howling wind a few kilometres away. There are places known for exposure to both south easterly and north westerly winds, and some which are sheltered from one or the other, while the south-westerlies blow most places, but not usually to quite the same extremes. What this amounts to in practice, is that the weather conditions where you are at a particular time may differ significantly from those at a dive site a bit later in the day.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Sea conditions"]},"\n\n",{"type":"=====","value":["Waves and swell"]},"\nThe waves reaching the shores of False Bay and the Cape Peninsula can be considered as a combination of local wind waves and swell from distant sources. The swell is produced by weather systems generally south of the continent, sometimes considerably distant, the most important of which are the frontal systems in the South Atlantic, which generate wind waves which then disperse away from their source and separate over time into zones of varying period. The long period waves are faster and have more energy, and move ahead of the shorter period components, so they tend to reach the coast first. This is known to surfers as a pulse, and is generally followed by gradually shortening period swell of less power.\n\nLocal winds will also produce waves which will combine their effects with the swell. Offshore winds as a general rule will flatten the sea as the fetch (distance that the wind has blown over the water) is too small to develop waves of great height or length. Onshore winds on the other hand, if strong enough will produce a short and nasty chop which can make entry and exit uncomfortable, and surface swims or boat rides unpleasant. \n\nThe combination of swell and wind waves must be considered when planning a dive. This requires knowledge of these conditions, which are forecast with variable accuracy by a number of organisations, in some cases up to 7 days ahead.\n\n",{"type":"=====","value":["Upwellings"]},"\nSouth-easterly winds which blow offshore and along the coast on the west side of the Cape Peninsula and the east side of False Bay cause a movement of surface water northwards along the coast and offshore to the west of the coast. This movement of water away from the coast is compensated by the upwelling of deeper water.\n\nThese upwellings are of considerable interest to the diver, as the upwelled water is generally cold and relatively clear. However, as the upwelled water has a high nutrient content, the upwellings are often forerunners of a plankton bloom known as a \"red tide\", which will drastically reduce visibility.\n\nOn the east side of False Bay the upwellings often cause poor visibility as they can disturb the very fine and low density sediment which is common on that side of the bay, particularly in the shallower part near Gordon's Bay. The water is also relatively cold, but not usually as cold as on the west side of the peninsula and temperatures may drop from around 19°C to 12°C over a day or two.\n\n",{"type":"=====","value":["Tides"]},"\nThe local tides are relatively weak, and there are no strong tidal currents on the Atlantic coast or in False Bay. The resulting tidal flows are of little consequence to the diver, the main effect being slight changes in the depth at the dive site and variations on the obstacle presented by kelp fronds near the surface, which can affect the effort required to get through the kelp at the surface. In this regard it is generally easier at high tide.\n\nBoat launches at some slipways can be difficult at low tide, which can occasionally affect boat dive schedules.\n\nMaximum tidal range at Cape Town is approximately 1.86m (spring tides), and at Simon’s Town 1.91m, with minimum ranges at both places of about 0.26m (neap tides).\n\n",{"type":"=====","value":["Water temperature"]},"\nAverage summer surface temperature of the Atlantic off the Cape Peninsula is in the range 10° to 13°C. The bottom temperature may be a few degrees colder. Minimum temperature is about 8°C and maximum about 17°C. \n\nAverage winter surface temperature of the Atlantic off the Cape Peninsula is  in the range 13° to 15°C. The bottom temperature inshore is much the same.\n\nAverage winter surface temperature of False Bay is approximately 15°C, and the bottom temperature much the same.\nAverage summer surface temperature  of False Bay is approximately 19°C. The bottom temperature is 1° to 3°C lower than it is in winter.\n\n",{"type":"=====","value":["Currents"]},"\nCurrents are not usually considered an issue at most dive sites in this region. A shallow surface current may be produced by strong winds, which can be an inconvenience if it sets offshore. This surface layer is shallow and a diver may return to shore at 3m depth below the current. Tidal currents are negligible, and are only experienced at a few isolated dive sites, such as Windmill, during spring tides when there is some swell running.\n\nThe only two places which may experience significant currents are at the mouth of False Bay, at Rocky Bank and Bellows Rock, where eddies from the Agulhas current frequently produce a light- to medium-strength current, which may be strong enough to inconvenience divers in the shallows around Bellows Rock.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Weather data"]},"\nReal time weather data is available for False Bay from a ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cfoo.co.za\/buoys\/buoy_rt.php?buoyID=9 weather buoy"]}," operated by the Centre for Observational Oceanography. Current and 7-day historical data is displayed for air and sea surface temperature, wind strength and direction, and barometric pressure. The position of the buoy may vary, but at October 2012 it was at 34°11'19\"S, 18°27'03\"E. (about 700m east of Simon's Town harbour)\n \nThere is also a weather station at Roman Rock lighthouse in Simon's Bay, with recent but not quite real-time (30 minute updates) and ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/spaceweather.co.za\/RomanRock.htm 7-day historical data available on-line"]},". \n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Predicting the weather and sea conditions"]},"\nPredicting diving conditions in this region is fairly complex. There are websites such as ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.buoyweather.com\/wxnav6.jsp?region=south_africa&program=Maps Buoyweather"]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.surf-forecast.com Surf-Forecast"]}," and ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.windguru.cz\/int\/index.php?sc=91 Windguru"]}," which provide reasonably reliable forecasts for wind and swell. This combined with information on recent conditions of water temperature and visibility will allow a fairly reliable prediction of conditions a few days in advance. The local ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/wavescape.co.za\/ Wavescape"]}]}," website and surf report is also a valuable reference with a distinctive South African ambience, though like the others, it is primarily intended for surfers, and divers must interpolate a bit. \n\nVisibility can clear up quite quickly (overnight) on the Atlantic coast due to currents and relatively coarse sediments. On the west side of False Bay it is a little slower, and it can take several days, even weeks, on the east side of the bay, where the sediments are fine and light.\n\nUntil you have developed a feel for this procedure, it is useful to get second opinions from people or organisations with experience. \n\nSome of the local dive charter operators have better reputations for weather prediction than others, and there are some who will almost always claim that conditions are or were good. The ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.blueflash.co.za\/ Blue Flash"]}," weekly newsletter is as good as any other and better than many.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["The marine ecology"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Kelp forest on high profile reef P9041231.JPG"],["thumb"],["280px"],["Kelp forest on a high profile inshore reef"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["The bioregions"]},"\n\nCape Point at the tip of the Cape Peninsula is considered the boundary between two of the five inshore marine bioregions of South Africa. To the west of Cape Point is the cool to cold temperate South-western Cape inshore bioregion, and to the east is the warmer temperate Agulhas inshore bioregion. The Cape Point break is considered to be a relatively distinct change in the bioregions and this can be clearly seen from the difference in marine life between the Atlantic seaboard of the peninsula and False Bay.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["The habitats"]},"\n\nFour major habitats exist in the sea in this region, distinguished by the nature of the substrate. The substrate, or base material, is important in that it provides a base to which an organism can anchor itself, which is vitally important for those organisms which need to stay in one particular kind of place.\nRocky shores and reefs provide a firm fixed substrate for the attachment of plants and animals. Some of these may have Kelp forests, which reduce the effect of waves and provide food and shelter for an extended range of organisms. Sandy beaches and bottoms are a relatively unstable substrate and cannot anchor kelp or many of the other benthic organisms. Finally there is open water, above the substrate and clear of the kelp forest, where the organisms must drift or swim.\nMixed habitats are also frequently found, which are a combination of those mentioned above.\nThe habitats are described in more detail in the following sections.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Rocky shores and reefs"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Muti-layered reef life P9041181.JPG"],["thumb"],["280px"],["Several layers of marine life may co-exist in apparent harmony"]]},"\n\nThe great majority of popular dive sites in the local waters are on rocky reefs or mixed rocky and sandy bottoms, with a significant number of wrecks, which are equivalent to rocky reefs for classification of habitat, as in general, marine organisms are not particular about the material of the substrate if the texture and strength is suitable and it is not toxic. For many marine organisms the substrate is another type of marine organism, and it is common for several layers to co-exist. Examples of this are red bait pods, which are usually encrusted with sponges, ascidians, bryozoans, anemones, and gastropods, and abalone, which are usually covered by similar seaweeds to those found on the surrounding rocks, usually with a variety of other organisms living on the seaweeds.\n\nThe type of rock of the reef is of some importance, as it influences the range of possibilities for the local topography, which in turn influences the range of habitats provided, and therefore the diversity of inhabitants.\n\nGranite reefs generally have a relatively smooth surface in the centimetre to decimetre scale, but are often high profile in the metre scale, so they provide macro-variations in habitat from relatively horizontal upper surface, near vertical sides, to overhangs, holes and tunnels, on a similar scale to the boulders and outcrops themselves. There are relatively few small crevices compared to the overall surface area. \n\nSandstone and other sedimentary rocks erode and weather very differently, and depending on the direction of dip and strike, and steepness of the dip, may produce reefs which are relatively flat to very high profile and full of small crevices. These features may be at varying angles to the shoreline and wave fronts. There are far fewer small caverns and swimthroughs in sandstone reefs, but often many deep but low near-horizontal crevices. In some areas the reef is predominantly wave-rounded medium to small boulders. In this case the type of rock is of little importance.\n\nThe coastline in this region was considerably lower during the most recent ice-ages, and the detail topography of the dive sites was largely formed during the period of exposure above sea level. As a result, the dive sites are mostly very similar in character to the nearest landscape above sea level. \n\nThere are notable exceptions where the rock above and below the water is of a different type. These are mostly in False Bay south of Smitswinkel Bay, where there is a sandstone shore with granite reefs.\n\n",{"type":"'''''","value":["Kelp Forests"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Dense kep forest with understorey P9041201.JPG"],["thumb"],["280px"],["Dense kelp forest with algal understorey"]]},"\n\nKelp forests are a variation of rocky reefs, as the kelp requires a fairly strong and stable substrate which can withstand the loads of repeated waves dragging on the kelp plants. The Sea bamboo ",{"type":"''","value":["Ecklonia maxima"]}," grows in water which is shallow enough to allow it to reach to the surface with its gas-filled stipes, so that the fronds form a dense layer just below the surface. The shorter Split-fan kelp ",{"type":"''","value":["Laminaria pallida"]}," grows mostly on deeper reefs, where there is not so much competition from the sea bamboo. Both these kelp species provide food and shelter for a variety of other organisms, and particularly the Sea bamboo, which is a base for a wide range of epiphytes, which in turn provide food and shelter for more organisms.\n\nThe Bladder kelp ",{"type":"''","value":["Macrocysta angustifolia"]}," can also be found at a few sites, mostly near Robben Island. This is one of the few places in the world where three genera of kelps may be found at the same place.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Sandy beaches and bottoms"]}," (including shelly, pebble and gravel bottoms)\n\nSandy bottoms at first glance appear to be fairly barren areas, as they lack the stability to support many of the spectacular reef based species, and the variety of large organisms is relatively low. The sand is continually being moved around by wave action, to a greater or lesser degree depending on weather conditions and exposure of the area. This means that sessile organisms must be specifically adapted to areas of relatively loose substrate to thrive in them, and the variety of species found on a sandy or gravel bottom will depend on all these factors.\n\nFor these reasons sandy and gravel bottoms are not usually popular with novices and visitors, who are usually attracted to the more spectacular sites, but to the diver who is interested in the full variety of the marine environment they can provide a refreshing and fascinating variation, as there are a lot of organisms which will only be found on these bottom types. Mostly they can be found adjacent to reef areas, but there are a few sites which are predominantly sandy.\n\nSandy bottoms have one important compensation for their instability, animals can burrow into the sand and move up and down within its layers, which can provide feeding opportunities and protection from predation. Other species can dig themselves holes in which to shelter, or may feed by filtering water drawn through the tunnel, or by extending body parts adapted to this function into the water above the sand.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Red tides"]},"\n\nOn the west coast of the peninsula and to a lesser extent the east side of False Bay, the south easterly winds can cause upwelling of deep, cold, nutrient rich waters. This generally happens in summer when these winds are strongest, and this in combination with the intense summer sunlight provides conditions conducive to rapid growth of phytoplankton. If the upwelling is then followed by a period of light wind or onshore winds, some species of phytoplankton can bloom so densely that they colour the water, most noticeably a reddish or brownish colour, which is known as a red tide.\n\nDepending on the species involved, these red tides may cause mass mortalities to marine animals for various reasons. In some cases the organisms may consume all the available nutrients and then die, leaving decaying remains which deplete the water of oxygen, asphyxiating the animal life, while others may simply become so dense that they clog the gills of marine animals, with similar effect. A third group are inherently toxic, and these may be particularly problematic as some filter feeding species are immune to the toxins but accumulate them in their tissues and will then be toxic to humans who may eat them.\n\nRed tides also have the more direct effect on diving conditions of reducing visibility. The reduction in visibility can range from a mild effect in the surface layers, to seriously reduced visibility to considerable depth.\n\nRed tides may be small and localised and usually last for a few days, but in extreme cases have been known to extend from Doringbaai to Cape Agulhas, several hundred kilometres to both sides of Cape Town, and take weeks to disperse (March 2005).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Equipment"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Standard equipment"]},"\n\nMost of the dive sites in this region are relatively shallow and can be done on air with ordinary recreational diving equipment, which would include:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" A full wet-suit of at least 5mm thickness, hood, boots and gloves."]},{"type":"*","value":[" A cylinder with harness, regulator and submersible pressure gauge."]},{"type":"*","value":[" A buoyancy compensator device (BCD)."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Mask and snorkel."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Fins."]},{"type":"*","value":[" A ditchable weight system correctly calibrated for the rest of the equipment."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Depth gauge and timer with decompression tables and dive plan, or a dive computer."]},"\nTo this you can add:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Any further equipment you or your certifying agency may consider obligatory, such as a secondary regulator, low pressure BCD inflator, knife, etc."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Any equipment you carry or use as a matter of personal preference, such as camera, signalling device, wrist slate, dry suit, reel and surface marker buoy, alternative gas supply, compass, etc."]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Recommendations"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" If your fins have full foot pockets (closed heel), and your wet suit boots have soft soles, it may be necessary to wear shoes to get to the entry point on shore dives.

It is required for the compass navigation routes.\n\nA dry suit is recommended for most dives on the Atlantic seaboard, or in general if the dive is deeper than about 20m and the water is colder than 13°C. An appropriate undergarment is required for the dry suit, at this is what provides the insulation. With a suitable combination it is possible to enjoy an hour's dive in comfort at a water temperature of 8°C, when most of the divers in 7mm wetsuits are cold after 30 minutes. If your face and head are particularly sensitive to cold, a full-face mask will keep your face warm.\n\nRecommendations for a light are for daytime dives, as lights are considered standard equipment on night dives. Backup lights should be carried on night dives from a boat. Underwater flashers may not be well received by the other divers as they are extremely annoying. If you feel you must use one, warn the others and stay away from those divers who do not wish to have a light continually flashing in their peripheral vision and distracting them. A strobe which may be switched on in an emergency is another matter entirely, and is accepted as a valuable safety aid.\n\nThe equipment recommendations are for divers who are competent to use those items, and if you are not, you should consider whether your competence is sufficient to dive the site without this equipment.\n\nNo recommendations are made regarding equipment for wreck penetration dives and deep dives. If you do not know exactly what equipment is required and have it with you, or are not competent in its use, you should not do the penetration. Depth, wrecks and caves are nature’s tools for culling reckless divers.\n\nRecommendations for gas mixtures are generic. You must choose the appropriate mixture based on your qualifications, competence and the dive plan. Nitrox mixtures are generally recommended to increase dive time without obligatory decompression stops, and Trimix to reduce narcotic effects. Nitrox is available from many of the dive shops, and charter operators will usually provide cylinders filled with the blend of your choice if given sufficient notice. Trimix is more difficult to arrange, as not many filling stations keep Helium in stock, so it may require a bit of shopping around.\n\nDecompression dives should generally only be planned by divers who are familiar with the site, and are competent and properly equipped for the planned dive. Recommendations in this regard are outside the scope of this article, and it will be necessary to discuss any planned decompession dives well in advance with the dive operator, as only a few of them are competent and willing to support planned decompression dives, and those will usually require strong evidence of your competence to do the dive, and advance notice of your dive plan.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Exotic equipment"]},"\n\n\nDiving equipment other than open circuit back mounted Scuba with half mask and mouth-grip demand valve is considered to be exotic for this section.\nThis would include surface supplied breathing apparatus and full face masks, used as standard equipment by commercial divers, and rebreathers, seldom used by commercial divers, but frequently used by military divers and gaining popularity with Technical recreational divers.\nAlso considered as exotic equipment is side-mount Scuba and diver propulsion vehicles (scooters), as they are not used by many recreational divers.\n\nGenerally speaking, any use of ",{"type":"'''","value":["surface supplied diving equipment"]}," will require special preparation and logistics, which are not available from the listed service providers, but are perfectly legal for use and technical support is available from the suppliers to the commercial diving industry in Cape Town.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Rebreathers"]}," are relatively uncommon, but are used by a few local aficionados, and sorb is available over the counter at a few suppliers.

There are also sites which have been known for years, but seldom dived due to their relative inaccessibility, and a few which are basically not particularly interesting, but have been included in the interests of completeness, as the information is available, and occasionally people want to know what they are like. With a few exceptions, the information provided is based on personal observation at the sites by Wikivoyagers. All photos of marine life and features of interest were taken at the listed site.\n\nGeographical information is provided in as much detail as currently available. Sites are geolinked, which allows them to be identified on various internet map systems. Positional accuracy is usually good. The maps provided should be usable, to scale, and accurate, but are not guaranteed either to be correct in all details or complete. Clicking on the thumbnail will open a link to a higher resolution image.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Atlantic coast of the Cape Peninsula"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Introduction and some tips on diving the Atlantic coast."]},"\n\nThis coastline from Table Bay to Cape Point is exposed to the south westerly swells generated by the cold fronts of the Southern Ocean. The continental shelf is narrow in this part of the coast and swells are not greatly influenced by the narrow band of shallow water, so they retain most of their deep-water energy.\nThese swells pound this coast most of the winter, and to a lesser extent in summer, so diving in this region is mostly a summer activity, and the frontal weather patterns far to the south are more important than local weather for swell prediction.\n\nThe south easterly winds are offshore in this area and tend to blow the swell down a bit. They also cause an offshore displacement of the surface water, which results in deeper water rising to take its place. This upwelling brings colder, initially cleaner water to the inshore areas, and can produce conditions of 20m+ visibility and temperatures down to 8°C, though more usually 10° to 12°C. The diving is wonderful if you are sufficiently insulated. Out of the water, however, it is commonly fine and hot, with blazing sunshine and air temperatures in the high 20 and 30 degrees Celsius. This means you will be overheating until you get in the water, hence the comment that summer diving in Cape Town is one easy step from ",{"type":"''","value":["hyper"]},"thermia to ",{"type":"''","value":["hypo"]},"thermia.\n\nThere is no escaping the need for a well-fitting, thick (preferably 7mm), wet suit or a dry suit with an adequate undergarment for these conditions if you intend to stay for more than a few minutes. Carrying a bottle of water with your equipment to wet the outside of your suit before or after putting it on will help keep the temperature down due to evaporative cooling, specially on a windy day. Overheating after leaving the water is seldom a problem. The alternative option of kitting up at the water’s edge requires a shore party to look after your clothes etc. while you dive, so it has become less common recently. Do not leave equipment unattended if you wish to see it again.\n\nAn upwelling is frequently followed by a plankton bloom, often called a red tide. This will reduce visibility considerably, particularly near the surface. Often the water will be much clearer below the surface layer, though the light levels may be a bit dim and the colour relatively green.\n\nThe south-easter is an offshore wind, and besides its influence on temperature and visibility, it also affects the swim back to shore after the dive. The south-easter can appear seemingly out of nowhere on a previously cloudless and windless day, and build up to near gale force in the time you are underwater on a dive, though it is usually predictable, so take note of weather forecasts, and in any case, allow sufficient reserve air to swim back a few metres below the surface. A compass is extremely useful if you do this as it allows you to swim shallower, which is good for air consumption, decompression and warmth. A depth of 3 to 5m is recommended for a long swim home. The strong south-easter in these cases produces a short, steep wind chop with white-caps which does not penetrate to any significant depth, but the constant slapping of waves and the spray in the air can make snorkelling unpleasant and difficult. There may also be a shallow offshore wind drift (surface current), but this does not usually extend below about a metre depth inshore. \n\nWhen boat diving a deployable surface marker buoy is useful to both facilitate controlled ascent and accurate decompression or safety stop depth, and as a signal to the boat that you are on your way up. In strong wind conditions it will also improve your visibility on the surface, specially if your equipment is all black, so it is worth carrying even if only as a signalling device. Bright yellow has been shown to be best for all round visibility at sea, but orange and red are fairly good too.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Table Bay dive sites.png"],["thumb"],["360px"],[{"type":"'''","value":["Dive sites from Robben Island to Camps Bay"]}]]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["Robben Island"]},"\nThese sites are all boat dives.

As a result of this the region is usually dived in winter, when the South-Easter seldom blows for long or with great force.\n\nThe winter frontal storms over the Southern Ocean produce swells which are slowed by the continental shelf and refracted and diffused round the Cape Peninsula, so that they propagate mostly parallel to the coastline, and have lost much of their energy by the time they curve in towards the shore. The irregular form of the coast here also protects some areas more than others. Generally speaking, those parts of the coast which run in a more north west to south east direction are better protected from the south west swell than the north to south parts, so the choice of dive site is dependent on the recent weather patterns.\n\nDuring the summer months when the South-Easter blows more frequently, for longer, and generally harder, this area is not often diveable, and the visibility is generally poorer than in winter even when conditions are otherwise suitable.\n\nThe water temperature during the winter months in this area is generally warmer than the Atlantic coast in summer, which is some compensation for the shorter daylight hours and often cold and rainy weather.\n\nBetween the cold and rainy fronts there are frequently days of little or no wind, and mild to warm sunshine, when the water is flat and clear and the diving is wonderful, and the large number of sites easily accessible from the shore make it difficult to decide where to go as there is so much choice. It’s a tough life here at the end of Africa, but somebody has to do it.\n\nWater temperature during winter is usually between 13°C and 17°C, though it has been known to drop as low as 11°C, so a good suit is also needed here. In summer the temperature may rise above 20°C, but is more likely to be around 17°C to 19°C. \n\nMost of the shore dives are relatively shallow, in the order of 8m to 15m maximum depth, though it is possible to do a 30m shore dive if you don’t mind a 700m swim to get there. The shallow waters make a dry suit less advantageous, but getting out of a wet suit in the wind and rain at night push the dry suit up again as a desirable option. It is nice to have the choice, and many local divers interchange wet and dry suits depending on the dive planned.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Kalk Bay"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Commercial diver training at Kalk Bay PB192738.JPG"],["thumb"],["280px"],["Commercial diver training at Kalk Bay harbour wall"]]},"\n\nThese sites are the northernmost sites of the west side of False Bay.

There are other influences, as some of the swells must pass over the shoal area known as Rocky Bank in the mouth of False Bay, and this tends to refract and focus the wave fronts on certain parts of the shore, depending on the exact direction of the wave fronts. As a result there is a tendency for some parts of the coast to be subjected to a type of “freak wave” which appears to be a combination of focused wave front, superposition sets and the effects of the local coastal topography. There are a number of memorial crosses along the coast to attest to the danger of these waves, though the victims are generally anglers, as divers would not attempt to dive in the conditions that produce these waves. \n\nThis area, like the Atlantic coast, is a summer diving area, though there will occasionally be conditions suitable for a winter dive.\nEven in milder conditions there tend to be more noticeable sets than on the Atlantic coast, and it is prudent to study the conditions for several minutes when deciding on an entry or exit point, as the cycle can change significantly over that time. Timing is important at most of these sites, and often when returning to the shore it may seem that the conditions have deteriorated dangerously during the dive. If this happens, do not be in a rush to exit, hang back for at least one cycle of sets, and time your exit to coincide with the low energy part of the cycle, when the waves are lowest and the surge least. When you exit in these conditions, do not linger in the surge zone, get out fast, even if it requires crawling up the rocks on hands and knees, and generally avoid narrow tapering gullies, as they concentrate the wave energy.\n \nThe local geology has produced a coastline with much fewer sheltered exit points on this side of the bay, adding to the difficulty, but there are a few deep gullies sufficiently angled to the wave fronts to provide good entry and exit points in moderate conditions. The most notable of these is at Percy’s Hole, where an unusual combination of very sudden decrease in depth from about 14m to about 4m, a long, narrow gully with a rocky beach at the end, and a side gully near to the mouth which is shallow, wide, parallel to the shoreline, and full of kelp, results in one of the best protected exits on the local coastline. As a contrast, Coral Garden at Rooi-els, which is about 1.7 km away, has a gully that shelves moderately, with a wide mouth and very small side gullies, which are very tricky unless the swell is quite low. \n\nThere is no significant current in False Bay, and this results in relatively warmer water than the Atlantic coast, but also there is less removal of dirty water, so the visibility tends to be poorer. The south Easter is an offshore wind here too, and will cause upwelling in the same way as on the Atlantic coast, but the bottom water is usually not as clean or as cold, and the upwelled water may carry the fine light silt which tends to deposit in this area when conditions are quiet, so the effects are usually less noticeable. These upwellings are more prevalent in the Rooi-els area, which is deeper than Gordon’s Bay.\n\nAs in the Atlantic, a plankton bloom frequently follows an upwelling. This will reduce the visibility, particularly near the surface. It is quite common for the surface visibility offshore to be poor, with better visibility at depth, but the reverse effect can also occur, particularly inshore. These effects are often associated with a thermocline.\n\nSurface water temperature on this side of the bay can range from as high as 22°C to as low as 10°C, and the temperature can differ with depth, sometimes with a distinct thermocline.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Gordon's Bay"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:View of Gordon's Bay from a dive boat DSC02336.JPG"],["thumb"],["View of Gordon's Bay from a dive boat heading south"]]},"\n\nThis area includes some of the best and most popular shore dive sites in the east side of False Bay.

By Rocky Bay the swell approaches the coastline almost perpendicularly, which makes it relatively rough in any south westerly swell.\n\nThe shoreline topography of this area is generally low rocky cliffs with occasional wave-cut caves, gullies and overhangs.

This is obviously impossible in Kelp forests, so it is fortunate that sea bamboo and the split-fan kelp are both fast growing and tough. In fact it is recommended that if you need to steady yourself in a surge, you use the lower part of the kelp stipes as handholds in preference to other organisms if there is no clear substrate to grip. They are generally strongly attached to the substrate as they must withstand a severe battering in storms, so the occasional diver holding on seems a light burden. In some cases small kelp plants may be ripped off in strong surge. You will learn to recognise when this is likely to happen and must then make another plan. \n\nThe damage done by divers in our local marine ecology appears to be mostly to slow-growing relatively fragile organisms below the surf zone. The false corals (Bryozoa) appear to be among the more fragile, and all contact with the scrolled, pore-plated and staghorn false corals should be avoided. Hard corals, soft corals, anemones and sea fans should also be treated as very sensitive. Sponges are probably less sensitive to being touched, but are not generally very strong and can tear fairly easily, and are unsuitable for holding on.\n\nRed bait (the very common and prolific large sea squirt ",{"type":"''","value":["Pyura stolonifera"]},") seems to be tough and resilient, and can be used as handholds, as it seems to take no noticeable harm, This does not apply to all ascidians, most are much more delicate. Red bait is also frequently the substrate for other, more delicate organisms, in which case, treat with the care appropriate to the more delicate species.\n\nKicking the reef and stirring up the sand bottom with your fins is considered bad form and the mark of an unskilled diver. Avoid this by maintaining neutral buoyancy and being aware of your position relative to your surroundings, keep leg and arm movements moderate, trim yourself to allow appropriate body orientation, and avoid dangling equipment, which may bang into the reef or get hooked up on things and cause direct or indirect damage. As a general rule, a horizontal orientation with fins raised above the torso is appropriate and allows maneuvering by using the fins without kicking the reef or stirring up a cloud of sand.\n\nSome photographers seem to have developed a nasty habit of shifting things around to suit the desired composition of the picture. This is extremely irresponsible and should not be done, as the handling may be fatal to some organisms. It is also illegal in Marine Protected Areas, though in practice, virtually impossible to enforce.\n\nCollection of marine organisms is illegal without the appropriate permit. If you need the organisms for some legitimate purpose, get the permit. Otherwise leave them undisturbed, and do not unnecessarily disturb other neighbouring organisms if you do collect.\n\nThere are concerns regarding the impact of sport diving on the reef ecology. Some of these may be legitimate, and study is necessary to test whether this is a real problem. The number of dives in the region has increased significantly over the years, but there is no numerical data available. The number of sites has also increased, so the frequency of dives at most sites will not have increased proportionately. Unfortunately the government department of Marine and Coastal Management has seen an opportunity to interfere with sporting activity and has made use of surveys on tropical coral reefs to support an effort to take control of sport diving on the temperate reefs around the Cape Peninsula. No surveys of temperate reefs can be produced to justify their claims and it seems unlikely that their interference will benefit either the ecology or the diving industry.\n \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:TMNP MPA boundaries.png"],["thumb"],["360px"],[{"type":"'''","value":["Boundaries of the Table Mountain National Park Marine Protected Area"]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Marine Protected Areas"]},"\n\nA large number of the dive sites of Cape Town are in the Table Mountain National Park Marine Protected Area as published in the Government Gazette No. 26431 of 4 June 2004 in terms of the Marine Natural Resources Act, 18 of 1998.\n\nA permit is required to scuba dive in any MPA.

An interesting, though not particularly logical consequence of the legislation, is that any wreck automatically becomes a historical wreck 60 years after the date of wrecking, with the effect that a pile of rusty rubbish, which anyone can remove at will, can overnight become a valuable and irreplaceable historical artifact and part of the National Heritage. There seems to be a similar effect on divers, who will assiduously scrabble around in a wreck, in the hope of finding an artifact that they wouldn't bend over to pick up if it lay in the street. \n\nNevertheless, wreck diving has its attractions, and the waters of the Cape Peninsula and False Bay have a large number of wrecks. The reasons for this are firstly that one of the world's major shipping routes passes round Cape Point, and secondly that the weather and sea conditions in this region can be very rough. The anchorage in Table Bay provides little shelter if the wind is from the north west, which is common in winter, and many ships have been driven ashore in and near Table Bay during winter storms when anchors have dragged or cables failed, and the ship was unable to beat off the lee shore. This happens less frequently since ships were motorised, but every few years another ship is blown ashore in Table Bay due to breakdowns or incompetence.\n\nThe list of wrecks is long, but the list of wrecks in areas convenient for diving is much shorter, and a significant number of the wrecks that are probably in convenient areas, have not been found. — Recording an exact position as the vessel went down was not often a high priority to the crews, even when it would have been possible. As a result, there is continued exploration and searches made by the wreck diving enthusiasts for wrecks for which approximate positions are known, and there are a few operators who jealously guard their knowledge of wreck locations so that they can have exclusive access.\n\nMany ships sank a significant distance beyond the point at which they were damaged, and many in water either too deep to dive or right up on the shore, where they were subsequently battered to bits by wave action. Others have deteriorated to the point where the average recreational diver would hardly recognise them as the remains of a ship. As a result of these factors, the number of wrecks which are popular dive sites is a small subset of the total number known, and many of these were originally scuttled, either as naval target practice, or as artificial reefs. These wrecks are dived fairly frequently, as conditions allow.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get help"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["In case of emergency"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["cautionbox"],[{"type":"''","value":["National Hyperbarics has closed indefinitely from January 2011.

In most cases there is no other option. The public transport in the region is not diver-friendly. Trains do not stop near most of the sites, Buses are infrequent, and also usually do not pass near the sites, and Mini-bus taxis are geared to maximising the number of passengers. If you are visiting for a short period and do not wish to rent a vehicle, it may be possible to arrange transport through a local divemaster or charter organisation. Ask if they have facilities for fetching you from your accommodation when you arrange a dive. Not all will offer this service, but it can be a great convenience if available. Some will even fetch you from the airport.\n\nIf travelling in your own or a rented vehicle, bear in mind that many dive sites, particularly on the Cape Peninsula, are notorious for theft from parked vehicles. Do not leave any items that may attract unwanted interest in the front of the vehicle, and ensure that the luggage compartment is secure. Dive clubs will sometimes arrange for an attendant to watch over parked vehicles during club dives.\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Street Guide to Cape Town"]},", published by MapStudio and available at most book shops in Cape Town, is recommended for finding your way around to any of the sites north of Miller’s Point on the peninsula, and north of Steenbras river mouth on the east side of False Bay. This is adequate for most divers.\n\nThe map shows the most useful main road routes for getting around the dive sites. Road signs for these routes are as good as any in the region. The National roads are indicated with white numbers on blue signs and the prefix ",{"type":"'''","value":["N"]},". Regional routes are white on green signs prefixed with ",{"type":"'''","value":["R"]},".

These boats are usually launched from a slipway for the day’s dives and are transported to the slipway on trailers. The boats are usually from 6 to 7.5m in length and are licenced to carry from 8 to 12 divers.\n \nBookings are made by phone, e-mail or in the shop. If you are not known to the operator you will be asked to present certification, and usually to sign a disclaimer.\n\nMany of the dive charter boats in this area are purely transport facilities, leaving the responsibility for safety during the dive to the divers. If you want a guided tour, or need a buddy, check whether this is provided before booking.\n\nEquipment is usually loaded onto the boats before launching or at a jetty near the slip. Diving suits are generally put on before boarding and worn during the ride, though occasionally jackets may be carried and put on at the site if the weather and sea conditions are suitable. Ask your skipper.\n\nIf you dive with unusual or specialised equipment such as large twin cylinders, side mounts, rebreather or bulky video equipment it is recommended that you clear this with the operator before booking. Similarly if you wish to dive solo or do scheduled decompression this should be cleared before booking, as some charter boats do not cater for these procedures.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Liveaboards"]},"\nThere are no liveaboard dive boats based in Cape Town. However there are a number of large motor and sailing yachts that may be chartered, and there is no fundamental reason why they could not be chartered for a dive trip.

Research the site, ask the locals, but the final responsibility is with the diver to assess each site personally. Beware of loose rocks and slippery slopes.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Sea and weather conditions"]},"\n\nThese are variable, and even the experts get them wrong occasionally from forecasts and reports. You just have to estimate which area looks most promising, and go there to take a look. Be aware that a strong offshore wind can develop in a relatively short time, and plan accordingly. This is particularly prevalent in summer, when a strong south Easter can spring up from a quiet morning, and make a long surface return swim hard work.\n\nMany of the shore dive sites have limited access areas, which may vary in suitability with changes in tide or weather conditions.\n\nThe air and water temperatures can also be considered as hazards, particularly in summer on the Atlantic coast, where on an extreme day it is possible for the air temperature to be over 30°C and the water below 10°C. Both hyperthermia and hypothermia are possible on the same dive outing.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Boats and shipping"]},"\n\nSome areas are more heavily used by seaborne traffic than others. In this respect, shore dives are not generally a problem, except for a few of the deeper shore dives on the west side of False Bay, in the vicinity of Miller’s Point. It is recommended to tow a brightly coloured SMB with an Alpha flag if you dive Boat Rock, Outer Castle, Oatlands outer reefs, or Photographer’s Reef as a shore dive. \n\nBakoven is a launching site for the National Sea Rescue Institute, and divers are  required to tow a SMB when diving there. \n\nThe Law requires all powerboats to be in the charge of a licensed skipper who is theoretically aware of the international regulations regarding divers in the water and keeping clear, but in reality there are a number of skippers who are either ignorant or don’t care. Look out for yourself and do not fasten the SMB to your equipment in an area of boat traffic, in case it gets hooked up on a boat and you get dragged up. Report incidences of dangerous boat-handling to Table Mountain National Park offices if in their jurisdiction, or to the nearest harbour master.\n\nIncidences of dangerous or illegal boat handling can be reported to the SA Police Services Water Wing in Simon's Town, but it appears that they only work alternating weekends, so there is a 50% chance there will be no-one there, and the regular police charge office does not know how to deal with this class of offense. More action is likely if you report the problem to SAMSA, (South African Marine Safety Authority). Try to provide as much information as possible to identify the offenders. Ideally the registration number of the vessel should be included, and a photograph can be helpful.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Marine life forms"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Electric ray Narke capensis P9111264.JPG"],["thumb"],["280px"],["The One-fin electric ray can deliver a startling shock to the unwary diver"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Juvenile abalone and Urchins at A-Frame DSC04114.JPG"],["thumb"],["280px"],["The Cape urchin is abundant and its spines are sharp but not venomous"]]},"\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Great White Shark"]}," is found in False Bay and is considered by some to be a danger to divers. This may be true, and it would be prudent to avoid them when possible. There are areas and seasons when they are more common. The west side of False Bay from Muizenberg to Simon’s Town seems to be the most popular inshore cruising ground, particularly in spring and summer, and Whittle Rock has also been reported to be a popular site for the sharks. Seal island is known as their main feeding area, and there are known cases of attacks on divers and close encounters of the terrifying kind from that area. If you want to see the sharks, do a cage dive with a licensed operator. If you do encounter one during a dive, try to avoid looking like a seal. Some divers suggest keeping close to the bottom, most recommend getting out quickly. Hanging around in mid-water or on the surface is not recommended by anyone. If there are Great Whites around, a safety stop may not be safe. On the other hand, if you do a cage dive, some cage operators will tell you that the noise of open circuit Scuba keeps the sharks away, but this may be to save them money by not providing air and space on the boat for Scuba equipment. Cow sharks are not kept away by Scuba noise.\n\nAn analysis of sightings by shark spotter personnel has shown that some conditions are correlated to shark sightings:\n\n:More sharks are seen in summer than in winter. This trend has been known for a long time, and is confirmed by the data. \n\n:Sea surface temperatures of 16-20 degrees increase the probability of a sighting — the probability of a shark sighting at Muizenberg is significantly higher when the water is warmer. This is thought to relate to the preferred temperature range of many of the shark’s prey species. \n\n:There is a greater probability of shark sightings from 3rd quarter (waning) to new moon than at full moon. \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Bluebottles"]}," or ",{"type":"'''","value":["Portuguese Man o’ War"]}," are often seen in the bay, and can give an unpleasant sting, which may be dangerous to sensitive people. A wet suit is good protection. Avoid contact with your face; hands can be used to cover the exposed parts, or dive below the trailing tentacles, which can be quite long. Box jellyfish are also reputed to sting. Note that the stinging cells of bluebottles and jellyfish may become attached to your gloves or other equipment by contact during a dive, and may later sting you if they come into contact with unprotected skin. The trianglar shaped leafed  succulent beach groundcover creeper the 'Sour Fig' provides excellent treatment. Rub some of the leaf`s juice on the sting. Ammonia also works well as does Meat Tenderiser.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Cape Fur Seals"]}," are not considered a hazard, though they make some people nervous. If they are relaxed, there are probably no Great Whites hunting nearby. If you ignore them they will typically get bored eventually and go away.

This is unlikely to happen as they are shy and usually avoid divers, but it could happen that you might touch one inadvertently when it is buried under the sand. This is highly unlikely, and will probably not do any lasting harm. Don’t worry about it, and don’t touch any disc-shaped ray that your buddy suggests you handle.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Sea urchin"]}," spines are a real but minor hazard. Surge or inattention may result in you getting spiked by these. If they bother you, get medical attention, but usually they will dissolve or if large may work their way out in time. A few spines is not usually considered a reason to abort a dive. There are so many sea urchins that it is only a matter of time before you get spiked by one. It is no big deal, the local urchins have fairly short and non-venomous spines, but they will go right through most suits and gloves.\n\nThere are various ",{"type":"'''","value":["polychaete worms"]}," with bristles that may be an irritant. Avoid touching them. Gloves which are recommended as thermal protection will also protect against these bristles.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Red tides"]}," have occasionally produced irritant aerosols which can affect the respiratory passages. More often they do not and merely cause poor visibility, but bear this in mind. If by some chance you find yourself diving in waters where the air on the surface seems to be an irritant, breathe off your scuba gear until clear of the water. Associated toxins in the water may also produce a skin rash in these conditions, so get out as soon as possible.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Terrestrial life forms"]},"\n\nMost of the terrestrial life forms in the Western Cape are not ordinarily considered a hazard to divers, though theft from parked vehicles at dive sites puts people at the top of the list.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Baboons"]}," in the southern peninsula and Rooi-els areas have become an occasional nuisance as they have learned to steal food from tourists, and as they are quick and strong and are armed with large teeth, they should be taken seriously. Some have learned how to open car doors and break into houses. Do not feed them, do not let them see that you are carrying food, and do not leave food where they can get to it. If you do you may be prosecuted, and will certainly be contributing to a problem that may result in serious injury to people and the necessity to kill the offending baboons. \n\nThere are a few species of ",{"type":"'''","value":["venomous snake"]}," in the area, but mostly they are shy and keep away from people.\n\nAt some sites it is necessary to walk through bush with overgrown paths.

There are no endemic parasite-transmitted diseases. The area is free of Malaria, Bilharzia, Sleeping sickness and other tropical diseases. Aids can be avoided by the usual precautions, and municipal water supplies are safe to drink. Sewage is treated before discharge to the sea, and the greatest hazard is probably storm water runoff from the Cape Flats after heavy rains. Most of the dive sites are in areas well clear of major storm drainage, and if the water looks clear it should be fine.\n\nMarine filter feeders should not be eaten after Red tides, but anything served in a restaurant should be safe.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Artificial hazards"]},"\n\nUnfortunately some of our citizens and visitors are complete slobs and dispose of their garbage illegally, and broken bottles and similar hazards may be encountered.

If you do have the good luck to encounter a whale during a dive, be careful, as their huge size makes it easy for a diver to be injured unintentionally.\n\nDolphins are also seen in False Bay and on the Atlantic seaboard. Common dolphins occasionally visit on schools numbering in hundreds to thousands, but are not often seen by divers.

Most of the reef fish are camouflaged to some extent. Many are silvery grey and countershaded, like the ubiquitous Hottentot seabream, the silvery Fransmadam and the Steentjie. Others have vertical bars or dark patches which may help break up their profile in kelp, such as White stumpnose, Zebra, and White steenbras, while many of the smaller species are cryptically coloured and blend very well into their environment. These are generally fish which spend most of their time on or very close to the reef, and their coloration is usually an indication of the typical colours of their habitat. These include various endemic klipfish, and a few blennies and gobies, the fingerfins, Cape triplefin, Smoothskin scorpionfish, two species of horsefish, a pipefish and the Rocksucker. There are also a few red fish, which are fairly visible, such as the very common Roman, and the less common Red stumpnose and Red steenbras. Most of the fish mentioned are solitary or found in small shoals, but there are also Strepies and Maasbanker which tend to shoal in fairly large numbers, and moderately large shoals of Hottentot are seen quite frequently. Galjoen are fairly rare and usually seen in small groups on top of the reef where there is a lot of wave movement, and the similar looking Cape knifejaw prefers deeper and high profile reef between the rocks. Seacatfish are shy and tend to spend the daytime in crevices and holes.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Sandy areas"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Sole at A-Frame DSC04159.JPG"],["thumb"],["280px"],["Sole"]]},"\nThe sandy areas also have their characteristic fish, which include a few species of ray, soles, gurnards, a pufferfish and the Beaked sandfish, which is rare and shy by day, but may be seen in large numbers at night at some sites, when it comes out of the sand it hides in and swims around freely. A few species of klipfish are also sand-dwelling, with the various species preferring different densities of sand, with those preferring fine sand having a more snake-like body, whereas those in coarse sand being more robust. Their body pattern tends to match the type of sand as well.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Reef invertebrates"]},"\n\nBenthic invertebrates provide most of the bright colours on the reefs of this region, and the distribution of species is as characteristic of the different sub-regions as the depth and water temperature. The diversity is large, and there is a big variation in the predominant reef cover with both depth and geographical location. The characteristic reef life varies considerably between the east and west sides of the Cape Peninsula, and this is recognised as the border between the South Western Cape and Agulhas Inshore Bioregions. The vertical zonation is also characteristic of the different bioregions, so there can be very noticeable differences in what can be seen at the various sites.\n\nThere is a general tendency for a given area of reef to be dominated by a particular species of organism, for example, Common feather stars, Red-chested sea cucumbers, Mauve sea cucumbers, Red Bait or sea urchins, to the extent that a major part of the surface area is covered by the dominant organism. This does not mean that there is no variety, as there is a large range of habitats on most reefs depending on orientation and rugosity, and to a large extent, sessile organisms live where they can, and this is largely dependent on where the planktonic larvae find a foothold.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Midwater"]},"\n\nPelagic invertebrates are by their mostly planktonic nature unpredictable as to when and where they can be seen. They include several species of jellyfish, a few species of comb jelly, a few sporadic siphonophores, salps and pteropods, and lots of things too small to easily notice. There are also squid, but they are very shy and are seldom seen by day.\n\nThe sponges, cnidarians, comb jellies, flatworms, segmented worms, arthropods, molluscs, bryozoans, echinoderms, ascidians, fish, sea birds and marine mammals recorded from this region are listed in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[[":Wikipedia:List of marine animals of the Cape Peninsula and False Bay"]]},". Many of these might be seen by a recreational diver.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Seaweeds "]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Kelp forests"]},"\n\nKelp forests are the most obvious seaweeds of Cape Town. There are three genera found locally, sometimes in close proximity. The most obvious is the Sea bamboo, which reaches the surface when fully grown, and has a thick stipe with a gas-filled cavity at the top, and which keeps the frond near the surface for maximum exposure to the light. This kelp is very common on the Atlantic seaboard, and is also found on both sides of False Bay, but more commonly towards the southern part of the bay.\n\nThe smaller Split-fan kelp grows on deeper reefs, and does not reach the surface. The stipes are shorter and there is no gas-filled cavity, so the fronds stay submerged in the darker waters. This kelp is found in deeper water than the Sea bamboo, with a similar geographic range.\n\nThe third is the Bladder kelp, which has clusters of long thin stipes, with long fronds and large numbers of small gas-filled bladders which keep the kelp upright and the fronds at the surface. This kelp is not found in False Bay, and is mostly seen near Robben Island. \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Algal turfs and kelp forest understoreys."]},"\n\nBelow the kelp fronds, the reef in shallower areas where there is enough light, may be covered by an understorey of assorted seaweeds, and the particular species will depend on a variety of factors, including the amount of light available, and the amount of water movement. As a rule, green and brown seaweeds will be found in shallower areas, and reds will be deeper, as they can survive with less light. The deepest are often the red coralline algae, which can form a dense turf on the upper surfaces of rocks.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Encrusting corallines."]},"\n\nWhere the surf is too powerful or the light is too dim for other seaweeds, the encrusting coralline algae may still find a foothold and thrive. These red algae form a fairly hard and tightly adherent crust on the reef, and are also known as \"pink paint\", which is a fair description of their appearance — they don't look at all like seaweeds. Their range is almost anywhere in the region where enough light penetrates and there is no other occupant already on the reef.\n\nThere are about 57 green seaweeds, 49 brown seaweeds and 240 red seaweeds recorded from this region in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[[":Wikipedia:List of seaweeds of the Cape Peninsula and False Bay"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Shipwrecks "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Divers at boiler of Cape Matapan PB172528.JPG"],["thumb"],["280px"],["Divers on the wreck of the Cape Matapan in Table Bay"]]},"\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cape of Storms"]}," and the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cape of Good Hope"]}," are both traditional appellations for this region, and for good reason. The weather can be very bad at times, and the coast is very exposed, with few sheltered harbours, but is also an important waypoint on one of the worlds great maritime trade routes. As a result, there are a daunting number of shipwrecks recorded along the local coastline. \n\nMany of these wrecks have never been found, and many others have been broken up beyond recognition, or covered in sand, or in the case of Table Bay, been buried under land reclamation projects, but several are in diveable places and may be visited by divers if conditions are suitable.\n\nDepths of the diveable wrecks vary from 3 or 4 metres, to more than 65 metres, and condition varies from half buried fragments of wood or steel, to ships that retain most of their original structure and appearance, and loom out of the depths as if sailing through the sand bottom.\n\nMost are heavily encrusted with reef organisms, ranging from seaweeds in the shallow water to a large range of colourful invertebrates in deeper water. They also shelter a variety of reef fish, and may be visited by pelagic fish on unpredictable occasions. In effect, they serve as artificial reefs, and as a result are generally also of interest to divers who are not particularly interested in them as artifacts.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Topographical features "]},"\n\nMany of the sites are characterised by interesting topographical features, including pinnacles, gullies, caverns, swim-throughs and overhangs. These features are notable not only for their contribution to the seascape, but also provide major variations in available habitats at the site, and the result is a strong correlation between high biodiversity and interesting topography. The general topographical character of a site is dependent on the geology, and the granite sites are instantly distinguishable from the sedimentary sandstone and shale sites. The granite rocks are typically rounded and stacked as corestone boulders on outcrops of the same rock, often with white quartz sand between them, or as a gradually sloping base. These stacks of variously sized rocks often form pinnacles, and gullies in fairly random directions, and the overhangs and holes between them are in some cases large enough for divers to swim through, providing a spectacular reef structure.\n\nThe sandstone strata tend to produce formations dominated by the local dip and strike, and this is more predictable. However, the detail on a smaller scale tends to produce more small holes, crevices, ledges and ridges than the granite areas, and these are less spectacular as a general rule. There are exceptions, where the sandstone reefs are very craggy, usually where the dip is quite steep, but not vertical, and the shoreline is quite steep, but in a different plane to the dip.\n\nFortunately the old dictum \"as above, so below\" applies quite well, and the character of the reefs can be predicted fairly reliably by observing the adjacent shoreline landscape. The major exception to this rule is south of Smitswinkel Bay, where there are sandstones above the water and granite below.\n\nThe geological structure and history of this region is briefly described in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Marine geology of the Cape Peninsula and False Bay"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Read"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Reference books on the ecology of Cape Town's waters:"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''''","value":["From SURG ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/surg.co.za\/"]},", specifically for divers in this region:"]}," Available from selected dive shops and book shops in Cape Town, and direct from SURG.\n\nJones, Georgina. 2008.
