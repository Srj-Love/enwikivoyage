Landing is not allowed without a permit, with the exception of Burgess Island. They are being left to regenerate naturally, and are the home to some of New Zealands smallest endangered species, such as the Mokohinau skink, the robust skink and the Mokohinau stag beetle, and several endangered plant species.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["General topography"]},"\nThe islands are volcanic stacks at the edge of the continental shelf.
