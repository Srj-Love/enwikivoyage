The Islands have Maori names and were previously inhabited, but the group was given its popular name by Captain James Cook on 25 November 1769, after a pudding made from bread, milk and eggs, similar to French toast. \n\nIn about 1808 most of the inhabitants were massacred by a raiding party and the surviving chief abandoned the islands and declared them tapu - they have remained uninhabited since that time.\n\nIn 1981 the Poor Knights was established as New Zealand's second Marine Reserve, extending 800 metres out from all parts of the islands, associated islets, rocks and stacks, and in 1998 full protection was established over the entire protected area. \nThe islands themselves are an offshore nature reserve, and access is restricted to scientific studies.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["General topography"]},"\nThe islands are of volcanic origin, created by a series of eruptions some ten million years ago, and subsequently eroded to their present form. The islands have been ecologically separated from the mainland for about two million years, and are a haven for some of the most endangered terrestrial native wildlife. The Poor Knights comprises two larger islands, Tawhiti Rahi to the north, and Aorangi to the south, and a scattering of islets and rocks, the largest of which are Aorangaia and Archway island, to the south east of Aorangi. A group of smaller islets to the south west is called the Pinnacles, and the southernmost of these is the Sugarloaf.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Position"]},"\nFrom S35°26.646' to S35°29.518', and from E174°43.896' to E174°44.913', roughly 20km from the mainland\n",{"type":"*","value":["Tawhiti Rahi is about 2.9 km from north to south, and generally less than a kilometer wide."]},{"type":"*","value":["Aorangi is about 1.7km north to south and also generally less than a kilometer wide."]},{"type":"*","value":["Aorangaia and Archway Island are each about 350m long and about 150m wide."]},{"type":"*","value":["High Peak Rock (the Pinnacles) is at S35°32.840', E174°43.516'"]},{"type":"*","value":["Sugarloaf Rock is at S35&deg33.993', E174°42.402'"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate, weather and sea conditions"]},"\nSome sites are subject to strong currents, particularly at spring tides. These areas are mostly at archways, headlands and narrow gaps, and the currents may be too strong to swim against.\n\nWater temperatures are moderate, ranging between 14°C in winter and 22°C in summer.\n\nVisibility is generally between 15m and 40m for much of the year, and is usually best from late summer to the end of winter, during which time there is less plankton in the water. From September to November plankton blooms may reduce visibility to between 5 and 10 m.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Marine ecology"]},"\nThe marine ecology is diverse, and the abundance of steep walls, overhangs, arches and caves provide relatively shallow shaded environments suited to organisms that would otherwise be found considerably deeper.\n\nThere is a noticeable seasonal variation in the ecology, due at least partly to changes in temperature and lighting. The warming of the water and increased light in spring trigger plankton blooms, which provide food for the ecosystem and this triggers spawning and growth in many species.\n\nLarge aggregations of stingrays occur during summer, and visits from tropical pelagic species like mantas and sunfish become common.\n\nThe Poor Knights region is representative of the temperate location of North Island, but also supports tropical visitors, which find a home among the unfamiliar kelp forests. The islands are close to the edge of the continental shelf where there are upwellings of nutrient rich water, which provides a fairly constant supply of food to the extensive diversity of filter feeders. Density of organisms is generally greatest in places where the water flow is strongest, and benthic animals are most prevalent where the light levels are too low for lush growth of seaweeds, such as under the arches and along the walls.\n\nThe East Auckland current originates in the tropical waters off the east coast of Australia, and carries larval stages of tropical animals past Northland's east coast, where some of them settle on the reefs of the Poor Knights. Many of them do not survive the winter, but a few relatively hardy ones manage to make it through a few years. The waters are too cold for tropical reef-building corals, but provide ideal conditions for a range of seaweeds, which provide food and habitat for a variety of invertebrates and fish.\n\nAbout 120 species of fish are known from this region, and many of them occur in large numbers.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Equipment"]},"\nOrdinary recreational scuba equipment is adequate for most dives in this region.  A 5 mm wetsuit is sufficient in summer, but 7 mm wetsuit or drysuit is recommended in winter. Appropriate technical equipment and training is recommended for the deeper dives.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Dive sites"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Poor Knights Islands dive
