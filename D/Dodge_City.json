Dodge City was formed near the fort in the years that followed. In the 1870s it exemplified the spirit of the Wild West portrayed in American television and movies, most notably in the American television show \"Gunsmoke,\" which was set in Dodge City and popularized the phrase \"Get the hell out of Dodge.\"\n\nThe town had its heyday during the cattle drives of the late 1800s as quarantines made it one of the few places along the railroad where Texas ranchers could bring their cattle.  This quarantine, created to protect other breeds of cattle from a parasitic tick carried by longhorns, was extended to Dodge City in 1885, essentially ending the town's run as the \"Queen of the Cow Towns\".  By 1886 the gambling saloons, brothels, and other notorious establishments that had built the town's reputation had mostly closed.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe most common way of getting to Dodge City is ",{"type":"'''","value":["by car"]},", and is a worthwhile stop for anyone road-tripping along the  ",{"type":"'''","value":["US-50"]},".\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Dodge City Regional Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["DDC"]]},").
