For obvious reasons, it's rather difficult to reach the steep cliffside villages, where the Dogons have lived to protect themselves from potentially hostile neighbors, as well as wild animals. Today, the vast majority of the population lives in the plains below the escarpment in more recently constructed villages, but the old homes remain, and are taken care of and in excellent shape. \n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Traditional dogon masque.jpg"],["thumb"],["200px"],["Traditional Dogon mask"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["The Guide to guides"]},"\n\nFrom the moment you step off the bus, open your car door, sit down in a restaurant, or have a stretch outside your hotel, you will most likely have someone offering to be your guide through Dogon Country.  They can be quite insistent, annoying, and act to be offended if you yell at them to go away.  Some travelers have mused that the sole purpose of hiring a guide is merely to chase off other would-be guides.\n\nDo you actually need a guide?  Numerous guidebooks will tell you that you do, while some allude to the fact that actually you don't.  The guides in Dogon will almost always tell you that you do and there are even some signs telling you that entry to the village is prohibited without a guide.  The truth of the matter is that really, ",{"type":"'''","value":["you aren't required to have a guide"]},".  There are some caveats to this:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Language"]}," - If you don't speak French, you will indeed have to have a guide as there are very few people in the villages that speak that many extra languages, although English is gaining ground on French."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hassle"]}," - Traveling without a guide is indeed more difficult as you have to negotiate everything yourself and for those who don't enjoy haggling or have the time to do this, a guide makes things easier."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Respect"]}," - Guides are useful in stopping you from making a mistake or walking somewhere you shouldn't in the villages, which can incur a fine for sacrificing an animal to purify the grounds you have defiled.  Of course, you don't need a guide from Bandiagara or Mopti to help you with this and hiring someone locally for 3,000 CFA upon arrival will work fine."]},"\nIf you do decide to use a guide, how much should he (they are always men) cost?  Again, guidebooks will generally quote the amount at around 10,000-15,000 CFA per person, per day, which gets quite costly quite fast and explains why so many people are trying to act as guides given that most people in Mali earn about 1,000 CFA a day.  Most will ask for a great deal more than this amount initially and you will absolutely have to haggle him down.  Due to the incredible amounts of money spent by various travelers to Dogon Country, some will even start out their prices at 50,000 CFA per person, per day.\n\nThe price you pay can include any variety of things, but it should absolutely include visiting 2-3 villages per day, the tax for those villages, and meals.  It will not include drinks (which are quite expensive in Dogon Country) or transportation.  If you can, insist on writing up a contract prior to leaving so that there is no changing of plans during the trip.  Proper agencies, while more expensive should always print a contract as well as require the money upfront.\n\nIf you opt to hire a local guide upon arrival to the villages, they will generally charge about 3,000 CFA for everyone as well as the village tax (generally from 1,000-3,000 CFA.)  For those wishing to save money, directly support those who choose to stay in their villages to carry on the traditions, as well as discourage the guide industry seen in larger towns, this is a good balance of options.  For those wishing to have someone lead them on a hike (ex. from Dourou to Nombori), a local can be hired for 3,000 CFA to walk you down.  Again, it directly supports the local people and works well for those willing to adventure a little.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nThe local ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dogon phrasebook"],["Dogon language"]]}," is spoken by everyone, but due to its popularity with tourists ",{"type":"[[","value":[["French phrasebook"],["French"]]}," remains the lingua franca. English is spoken by only a handful of tour guides in the entire region and practically no one outside the handful of cosmopolitan (relatively speaking) base camps\/towns. A working knowledge of French is essential unless travelling with one of the few guides who speak English.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nUnfortunately you have to hire some kind of car to get in to the heart of Dogon, whether you rent it with or without a driver.  With a driver, cars in Mopti will generally costs 50,000 CFA per day plus gas.  You might be able to haggle them down to 25,000 if you're going to rent it multiple days or it is the low season, but it will be money hard-won.  Drivers are difficult as they generally don't like to drive and if you want to visit three villages in a day, most will get grumpy, which means you will have to be firm and emphasize your plan.\n\nBandiagara, Bankass, Douentza are the three main town entry points in to Dogon and places where you can find a never ending supply of harassing guides as well as supplies for the trip, although they will cost a great deal more than in a town such as Mopti.\n\nFor those who will make the hike down in the villages, the most common starting point are the larger villages of: Kani-Kombolé, Djiguibombo, Endé, Dourou, and Sanga.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThere are almost no roads in the region, except those connecting a couple of towns used as base camps with the neighboring regions.  You will need to go on foot and be in relatively good shape.  A number of the hikes are quite strenuous, although you'll see village women trekking up them with piles of goods on their heads.  Despite the fact that the Dogon people walk these trails in sandals, it is advisable for anyone visiting to wear either a sturdy pair of running shoes or hiking boots depending upon your needs.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nThere are hundreds of unique towns scattered throughout the region and while all are unique and, while there is no \"typical\" Dogon village, most can be found built into the sides of hills and escarpments.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Itineraries"]},"\nPeople generally plan any number of approaches to Dogon Country.  Most common is to spend about three days which allows one to visit several villages, stay in them (amenities are generally rather comfortable all things considered) and then get out.  Day trips are also quite doable to a number of villages, such as Nombori.  Villages like Songo can be visited in a morning.\n\nThere is also the opportunity to spend a week or more hiking the entire escarpment.  This is recommended only for the truly adventurous who want to take the time to plan out the trip and be prepared to buy supplies en route.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Villages"]}," - Whether you enter with a one or many day trip, it is well-worth the journey.

Most villages will sell arts and crafts to tourists.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nTowns will generally sell small quantities of food to tourists, but there are no restaurants outside the couple of major base towns. You will likely be sharing a meal with a family. You should bring food with you to eat, although there is food to be had in the more recent small guest-houses, where they will feed you sauce (occasionally meat sauce) over rice, noodles, or couscous. It's simple, but quite tasty and cheap.\n\nWater is a scarce commodity (do not expect to use water for bathing or hand washing) and you should bring some with you, especially to prevent dehydration while trekking between villages.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Chez Potasse"],["url="],["email="],["address=Nombori"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Walk in to the center and ask"],["phone=+223 656 88 982"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Quite a decent place considering how far it is from the main towns.

It is more cost effective to stock up on supplies in a town such as Mopti where you will find a greater selection and better, albeit still high prices.  Inside Dogon Country, a 1.5 liter bottle of the Malian Diago brand of water will costs around 1,250 CFA, although it is often the case that they will lower it if you buy more.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Respect"]},"\nDogons are very spiritual and visitors should be very keen to respect their beliefs. One should always ask if it is appropriate to photograph something. Altars may look like piles of dirt to the untrained eye and religious buildings may look like just a house, both of which (along with people, unless you ask permission) should not be photographed.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nIf trekking, you should be in good physical shape and carry and drink lots of water to prevent dehydration.  Head covering is also recommended as the midday sun is exceedingly strong and can even catch a well-hydrated traveler offguard.  Good, sturdy shoes, whether general running\/walking type or hiking boots are recommended for the treks as the terrain can be difficult to traverse on some of them.\n\nMany people find walking poles to be helping for the flatter parts of the trip, but in general, they are a hindrance, especially when navigating steep areas.  Use your own judgment when carrying them, but be advised that they will be dead and awkward weight if you find you don't need them.\n\nLastly, be careful of snakes in brush (although most are nocturnal).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mopti"]]}," - It is the nearest large town with all the supplies people could need as well as good connections back to Bamako."]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Mopti (region)"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usableregion"]]},"\n\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:category:Dogon Country"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Dogon people"]]}]
