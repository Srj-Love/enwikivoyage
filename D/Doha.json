Following the accession of Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani as Emir in 1995, however, Qatar quickly began to modernize, and Doha is now taking huge strides to catch up with other nearby Gulf cities, especially in preparation for its hosting of the FIFA World Cup in 2022. The city is very much a work-in-progress, with a rapidly growing skyline and new buildings sprouting up almost like mushrooms.\n\nFor most visitors, Doha is synonymous with Qatar, as the vast majority of the country's population resides in the capital city. Doha has an astonishingly diverse population – just 13% of residents are native Qataris. Although Arabic is Qatar's official language, English is by default the lingua franca, as the majority of the city's expats do not speak Arabic, including most shopkeepers and service providers. Doha is also now one of the fastest-growing cities in the world, as workers continue to pour in to help build the developing economy.\n\nIf you've visited before, be assured that Doha today is not the same as it was just a couple of years ago, and will be very different again in a few years time.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Read"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mohanalakshmi Rajakumar"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["From Dunes to Dior"]},".

Pretty much all airlines of the Middle East, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Turkey"]]}," included (but not ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Israel"]]},"), provide connections to Doha.

Public Wi-Fi is provided free of charge throughout the terminals. \n\nThe much larger ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/dohahamadairport.com ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hamad International Airport"]}]}," has been constructed on reclaimed land, and became fully operational on 27 May 2014.\n\nIf you're arriving from outside of the Persian Gulf region, probably the most economical way to visit is to use Qatar as an intermediate stopover en route to another destination. Prices of tickets originating in or terminating in Doha are artificially high because of limited competition, while prices for transit tickets are very competitive, as Qatar Airways continues working to build Doha as a global transit hub.\n\nThe cheapest method to reach Doha from within the Persian Gulf region is with local budget carriers, such as ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/flydubai.com\/english.aspx FlyDubai"]}," and ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.airarabia.com Air Arabia"]},", which provide cheap flights with a stopover in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dubai"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sharjah"]]}," respectively.

Alternatively, the manager\/dispatcher is happy to take your call on her mobile (+974 5534 2964) and this will prevent you waiting on hold or even getting a busy signal. The energetic young crew of Pinoy, Bangladeshi and Sri Lankan expats might not seem like the most organized bunch, but they try really hard to make things right, and they never stop smiling. There is shuttle service available from the airport to the first stop of the tour, which requires 30 minutes advance notice to arrange. If you're doing this on your last day in Doha, they will even arrange to pick you up at one of the main stops along the route and transfer you back to the airport for a not-unreasonable QAR 50 (US$14).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nOther than buses, the only alternative to not renting a vehicle is taxis. There are two taxi services, also operated by ",{"type":"''","value":["Mowasalat"]},": ",{"type":"'''","value":["Karwa"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Al Million"]},". Alternatively, \"limousine\" taxis are available, which are unmarked, much more expensive (sometimes twice the cost of Karwas) and may not carry a meter. If you feel sure about the fare, you can negotiate it up front, but it is advisable to insist on a meter.\n\nBecause of increasing complaints regarding taxis, some precautions should be noted. For nearly all journeys within Doha the tariff should be set to '1', and for journeys at night or outside of Doha it should be set to '0'. Airport taxis have a single tariff, which begins at QR 25. Reports of tampered meters are on the rise (look for black tape or paper), as well as reports of drivers locking the doors or refusing to open the trunk without extra payment. Technically if the driver refuses to use the meter, the ride should be free. If you have problems, you can call the police at 999, at which point the driver will suddenly be very cooperative.\n\nThe demand for taxis far exceeds the supply and waiting times may vary greatly. During morning business hours, companies usually require 24 hours notice if you need a taxi; however in practice, even this is unreliable as the scheduled taxi often doesn't show up. At other times, it may take upwards of 90 minutes for an on-call taxi to arrive, and hailing one may be impossible in many places. The only places where you are guaranteed to find a taxi (normal or limousine) are at major malls, the airport and international hotels. The acute shortage has led to a thriving market for unlicensed, or unofficial, taxi services, most with a steady clientele. For visitors, the best way to find a reliable driver is to ask around – many residents, particularly expats, hire such drivers regularly and will happily share contact information.\n\nOccasionally, you may find a local driver will stop and offer to give you a ride if he or she sees you looking lost on the side of the road. It is customary to offer some money at the end, though sometimes they will refuse to take it. If a driver slows down and flashes their headlights, they are usually signalling they're willing to give you a lift; beckon them over with a wave in response. However, hitchhiking always has its risks, and it is not an advisable practice for solo women.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nSeveral car rental agencies are located in and around Doha International Airport. The popular agencies include ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.hertz.qa\/rentacar\/car-rent\/qatar\/doha ",{"type":"''","value":["Hertz"]}]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/avisqatar.com ",{"type":"''","value":["Avis"]}]}," and ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/global.budget.com\/qa\/doha\/doh.html ",{"type":"''","value":["Budget"]}]},". These rental agencies offers seasonal discounts and it is advisable to check their websites before booking. If you're looking to rent a car, it is best to reserve in advance, to ensure a good price and minimise wait times. As of late 2013, visitors can drive a rental car for six months with an international driving licence. However, do note, the laws regarding driving licences change almost yearly; visitors are advised to verify this information before arrival.\n\nDriving in Qatar is on the right hand side of the road, with similar traffic rules to elsewhere in the world. However, because Doha residents come from all corners of the globe, driving styles vary wildly. Also, road rage is becoming more of a problem, and visitors should be aware that ",{"type":"''","value":["any"]}," gestures (or even eye contact) made with another driver can lead to jail time: in short, just grit your teeth!\n\nExpansion of the road network has not kept up with the explosive population growth of recent years, so drivers will encounter frequent traffic jams as well as numerous diversions due to road construction. With the addition of new roads, as well as renaming of old roads, even the latest available road maps may be out-of-date.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:MIA Doha Qatar2.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Museum of Islamic Arts"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Fanar Doha Qatar2.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Fanar Qatar Islamic Cultural Center"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Museums"]},"\nConsidering Doha is attempting to become something of a regional cultural hub, the current state of its museums is somewhat shambolic.
