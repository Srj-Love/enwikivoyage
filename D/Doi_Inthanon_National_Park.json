A good asphalt road takes visitors up, but is rather steep, thus the vehicle must be in a good condition. Visitors pay an entrance fee at km8.\n\nA songthaew (two bench pickup truck) will cost you about 2,000 baht for the day, including petrol (ask first!).\n\nA minibus tour will cost around 1,100-1,200 baht with an English-speaking guide. The trip includes a visit to the peak, two waterfalls, twin chedis, a royal development project, and a Karen village (somewhat uninspiring). The price includes all entry fees. It is far cheaper to book direct with the tour operator rather than through a hotel or agent. The tour is from approximately 08:30 to 16:30. All fees and a so-so lunch are included and you will be picked up and dropped off at your hotel (costs as of Jun 2011 using ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.journeycnx.com Journey Tours of Chiang Mai"]},").

The best period for viewing waterfalls is May-Nov. The best period for viewing wild flowers is Dec-Feb. The best period for ornithologists is Nov-Mar.\n\nAs you drive up the winding road to the top it will become steadily cooler. At the top you can walk around and check out the sights there. There is a shop for souvenirs and also for drinks and snacks, as well as toilets. In the rainy season, there are near-perpetual clouds here, so you might see little.\n\nOn your way back you will stop at the twin chedis (stupas) on the right side part way down near the top. The view is tremendous, the chedis are well worth a look, and the gardens are beautiful. There is an entry fee, but it is reasonable. Escalators are available to those who do not want to walk up the many steps. \n\nOn the way back to Chiang Mai, you may also want to visit either the Ganesh Temple\/Museum (well-worth a look even if you are not Hindu or Buddhist),or the umbrella factory (very touristy.)\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Doi Inthanon National Park Tourist Centre"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=At km9"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Exhibits on nature and the animals that inhabit the area."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Doi Inthanon Peak"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=An air force radar station and King Inthawichayanon’s stupa are on the mountaintop.
