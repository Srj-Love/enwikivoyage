[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Caribbean default banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Dominical"]}," is a city in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South Costa Rica"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nUsually people only need directions from the capital airport, SJO. There are three ways to get to Dominical, not counting the sea. The most common is from the east, via San Isidro (de General). San Jose is where you fly in and either bus or rent a car and head south to San Isidro. There you can buy some groceries at reasonable prices and head west (just ask for Dominical). This entire route takes you through cloud forests, mountain ridges, and river valleys and takes about four hours by car and six hours by bus (San Jose to Dominical). Coming in from the northern route now has a new, paved highway. From Quepos, Dominical is about a 1 hour drive. From the south what people do is fly into SJO, then make reservations for Sansa air flight to Palmar Sur and get a car rental to meet them there. From Palmar Sur to Dominical is the best road in the country, thought to support the future plans of an international airport in Palmar Sur. It only takes 45 minutes to drive from the airport to Dominical this way.\n\nThe best way to get to Dominical is using Easy Ride Shuttle service daily shuttles from San jose downtown and SJO airport shuttle leaves at 9:30AM, and 3PM rate is $45 one way per person in modern vans, professional drivers check www.easyridecr.com\n\nIt is also best to already know more about the area, places to visit and accommodation, the Town is becoming more touristic as it is considered a great surf spot and many retired surfers live here.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nThe number one attraction in Dominical is the beach and ocean. There's all the amenities to help you enjoy a safe and exhilarating time. Lifeguards are not a given in Costa Rica. Children aren't taught to swim and the Red Cross comes to the beach only 2 or 3 times a year for a few days (and then without ocean safety provisions). Funding continuously challenges the professionally trained Dominical Lifeguards program as they are wholly donation funded. This mean these shepherds of the sea are always happy to accept donations from travelers of surf fins, red swim trunks, sunscreen, floats, cans, and ... Preventative measures are strong (training, public awareness, manning the lifeguard tower and walking \/running the beach) as strong waves require alert beach-goers and fortunately there are Lifeguards in Dominical, dedicated to serving both national and international visitors. Everyone is encouraged to visit the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Dominical Lifeguards"]}," official website ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.dominicallifeguards.org\/index1.php\/"]}," to keep current with the program (lots of Dominical Surf Photos). The Annual 4th of July Sunday Lifeguards Fundraiser Extravaganza at Roca Verde Hotel\/Bar\/Restaurant has live music, Auction, Children's Games, Surfing, Beach Party, and a huge BBQ with \"Tooo Much\" Fixin's.\n\nFishing and Waterfalls tie for second in area attractions. Ziplines, caves, horseback riding, yoga, massage, socializing, and hiking are as well favorites here.

Thus, whale watching tours are popular and normally successful. This piece of the Pacific Ocean is one of only two places in the world where whales from the Northern Hemisphere and those from the Southern Hemisphere meet (the other is in North Africa). The Humpback is the star of the show, but six other species are also common.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nLearning to surf is big here in Dominical.
