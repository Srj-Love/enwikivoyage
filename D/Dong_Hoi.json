Dong Hoi was an important fortress of the southern Nguyễn Lords. The Đồng Hới Wall was considered the barrier which protected the Nguyễn Lords from the attack by northern Trịnh family. The site of Dong Hoi today is just south of this boundary. \n\nDuring the Indochina War (between the French and the Viet Minh in 1950s, the Đồng Hới airbase was used by the French to attack both the Viet Minh in north-central Vietnam and the Laotian Pathet Lao Army in central and southern Laos. During the Vietnam War, Đồng Hới was heavily devastated by bombardments from US B-52s due to its location near the seventeenth parallel and the demilitarized zone between North and South Vietnam. The city was almost leveled and was rebuilt slowly after the war ended in 1975. The town was planned and rebuilt on a large scale especially after 1990 when it officially became the provincial capital.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh =22"],["febhigh =23"],["marhigh =25"],["aprhigh =29"],["mayhigh =32"],["junhigh =34"],["julhigh =34"],["aughigh =33"],["sephigh =31"],["octhigh =28"],["novhigh =25"],["dechigh =23"],["janlow =17"],["feblow =18"],["marlow =20"],["aprlow =23"],["maylow =25"],["junlow =27"],["jullow =27"],["auglow =26"],["seplow =25"],["octlow =23"],["novlow =21"],["declow =18"],["janprecip ="],["febprecip ="],["marprecip ="],["aprprecip ="],["mayprecip ="],["junprecip ="],["julprecip ="],["augprecip ="],["sepprecip ="],["octprecip ="],["novprecip ="],["decprecip ="],["jansnow ="],["febsnow ="],["marsnow ="],["aprsnow ="],["maysnow ="],["junsnow ="],["julsnow ="],["augsnow ="],["sepsnow ="],["octsnow ="],["novsnow ="],["decsnow ="],["jansun ="],["febsun ="],["marsun ="],["aprsun ="],["maysun ="],["junsun ="],["julsun ="],["augsun ="],["sepsun ="],["octsun ="],["novsun ="],["decsun ="],["janh2o ="],["febh2o ="],["marh2o ="],["aprh2o ="],["mayh2o ="],["junh2o ="],["julh2o ="],["augh2o ="],["seph2o ="],["octh2o ="],["novh2o ="],["dech2o ="],["description ="]]},"\nThere are four distinct seasons in Đồng Hới.
