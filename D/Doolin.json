Until the 1970s ",{"type":"'''","value":["Doolin"]}," was just a typical Irish village, but then Irish folk music became more and more popular all around the world, and one of the best Irish whistle players, Micho Russell, lived in Doolin. During the times that he was not on US tour or in the studio, he could often be found at the O´Connor´s Pub in Doolin playing with his two brothers. This attracted an increasing number of tourists to the village, which in turn lead to more pubs offering Irish music sessions. Even though Micho Russel died in 1994, Doolin has retained its reputation as the unofficial \"capital of Irish traditional music\".\n\nAlthough the village is full of tourists during summer, it is not like other tourist destinations in Ireland. People who go to Doolin do not just take a few photographs and move on, but get involved. They explore the local the culture and participate in the music scene. Consequently, the atmosphere is very friendly.\n\nThe village itself is just one street, Fisher Street. This is where most of the shops and pubs are located. Beyond that, there is a wide net of small roads that consists of the residential area. So, be aware that if you want to visit Doolin, due to the small population of the village and limited accommodation, you may find yourself staying 5 miles away.\n\nAlso note that there is NO ATM in Doolin village so come prepared!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["From ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lisdoonvarna"]]},": Follow the L54 and the signs to Doolin"]},{"type":"*","value":["From ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ennis"]]},": Take the N67, direction ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lisdoonvarna"]]}," and turn left after 5km, follow signs to Doolin"]},{"type":"*","value":["Coming from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Galway"]]}," on a clear day you might also consider taking the L54 route along Black Head and Fanore, which takes a bit longer but you have a beautiful view over Galway Bay"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["At Doonagore Castle, just above Doolin, you have a wonderful view of the town."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Take a day trip to the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Aran Islands"]]}]},".
