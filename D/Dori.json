One barrage is very old, and the other one is under construction. (It should be finished in 2005.) There are also other slightly smaller barrages that form all over town during the rainy seasons. They make Dori a difficult place to navigate in the rainy season. Sand is another obstacle encountered when moving around in Dori. It is difficult to ride your bike through the sand during the dry season.\n\nSeveral languages are spoken in Dori. Most people speak Fulfulde (the language of Africa's Fulani societies), but there is also a lot of Mooré spoken around. Lots of children speak French -- at least well enough to ask white girls for gifts, candy, and\/or money. You can also find people of various ethnicities; hence, many other languages are spoken in different neighborhoods (\"cartiers\", in French). There are Peuhls, Mossis, Songrai (Songhay), Bella, Gulmance, Tauregs, people from Mauritania, and others.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" To ",{"type":"'''","value":["Dori from Ouagadougou"]}," There are 3 options: SOGEBAF, TSR, and STMB.

SOGEBAF and TSR leave both from the Sankariare gare (Fr. for “station platform”) de SOGEBAF. The TSR station is next to the SOGEBAF station. They both leave at 7h and 16h. The Ouaga – Dori bus trip costs 5000 CFA. Each Wednesday both companies send a bus to the marché of Gorum-Gorum. This bus leaves at 10h and can be very crowded. On Sundays, they send a bus to Markoye, at the same time. STMB goes from Ouaga to Dori, but only once a day. The bus leaves from the main STMB bus station at 15h.

Alternatively, as stated earlier, SOGEBAF and maybe TSR go from Ouaga to Gorum on Wednesdays at 10h and to Markoye on Sundays at 10h. The bus goes to Gorum and Markoye, respectively, the night before the Marché day, then leaves and goes back to Ouaga, supposedly the following morning; usually, it takes a little longer before the bus sets off from the Marché."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Le Marché"]}," (the market) is on the left, after the STMB Station.
