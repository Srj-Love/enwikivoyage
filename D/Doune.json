The castle is entered through a narrow gateway and a 46 ft (14 m) long vaulted passageway that leads to a large central courtyard. Off this, steps lead up to the Great Hall which is connected by arched servery hatches and a door to the massive kitchen. An enclosed staircase from the courtyard reaches the timber panelled Lord's hall and other apartments.
