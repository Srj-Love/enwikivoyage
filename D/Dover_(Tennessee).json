Easy to miss the steep entrance. Just turn as soon as you see the sign! Basic, clean, cheap rooms with a great view of Lake Barkley, including the sunset in the name. It's an old-fashioned motor inn with a row of rooms and doors onto the parking lot. Apparently a one-man operation, so you may have to wait for the owner to finish up another chore. No lobby, but each room has a chair out back, through a sliding door, to sit and enjoy the view over the lake. Marginal wi-fi internet access, which the owner says he's trying to improve. Microwave available at front desk. Small fridge in room. Small TV with cable, but no premium channels. A great find if you just want a quiet, cheap place to crash for the night."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name= Dover Inn Motel"],["url= http:\/\/www.parislanding.com\/doverinnmotel\/index.htm"],["email="],["address= 1545 Donelson Parkway Dover, TN 37058"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone= +1 931-232-5556"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["wikipedia="],["content= Motel rooms and cabins."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name= Leatherwood Resort and Marina"],["url= http:\/\/www.leatherwoodresort.com\/"],["email= leatherwoodpirates@gmail.com"],["address= 753 Leatherwood Bay Rd.
