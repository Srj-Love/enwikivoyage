Seating is \"Reserved Coach\" so a ticket guarantees you a seat. The cars, call \"Amfleets\", carry approximately forty to sixty passengers per car, arranged in pairs either side of the aisle. Seats can be arranged in facing sets of four, but in almost all cases you will find that seats will all face the direction of travel. Luggage racks and spaces for larger items are provided, along with toilets either at the end of the coach.\n\nAn Amtrak coach class seat size is roughly comparable with a business class airline seat: there is ample leg room, a reclining seat back and fixed armrests on the outside of each pair of seats. If there is a seat in front of you, a fold-down table will be available.

Seats are arranged in pairs to one side of the aisle, and singly on the other side of the aisle (called '2+1 seating'). There is more room than coach class. Seats include armrest and cup holders as well as an at-seat attendant service with complimentary refreshments and a newspaper.
