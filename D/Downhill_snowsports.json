Look for cold- and snow-rated waterproof gloves specifically designed not to allow any water inside. Straps help them seal to keep snow from getting in the opening, or to seal against your jacket. Extra straps attach them to your wrists or jacket so you can take them off without losing them. You can also get inner linings made from different materials designed to retain heat.

Instead, wear thermal layers (longjohns) made from warm materials, or \"performance\" clothes designed to wick away sweat so you stay dry (and therefore warm).

Although \"warm\" mountains always have beginners who think they can get away with just wearing jeans, you run a real risk of frostbite and permanent injury doing this, not to mention being miserable after your jeans soak up several hours worth of snow.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nThere are many types of skiing within alpine skiing, from contests to downhill (going straight without turns) to moguls (going around the bumps).  Cross country skiing is usually also available.  Nowadays most resorts allow snowboarders as well, but if you plan to do so double check beforehand.\n\nMost resorts also offer a variety of other activities such as horseback-riding and ice skating.  There are also usually great stores for shopping and wonderful restaurants in the area that are worth looking into after a day of hitting the slopes.\n\nSki resort areas are also frequented during the summer months because of their numerous hiking, mountain bicycling, etc. opportunities.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Learn"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Teach yourself"]},"\nBefore hitting the slopes, you'll need to get dressed. Most of the equipment is simple and straight-forward to put on. The legs of your snow pants have an inner layer that tucks inside your boots, and an outer layer that goes over top to keep snow from getting in. Snow jackets may have similar layers to seal your gloves.\n\nIf it's convenient, you may be able to take what you need with you (e.g., wallet for purchasing lunch) and leave everything else in your car or hotel room. Otherwise, there are usually coin-operated lockers where you can leave your street clothes, valuables, etc.\n\nGetting around in skis is pretty easy. Lay the skis on the ground, and then simply step in to each one toe-first. They'll click in to place, and it releases the catches that keep them from sliding around when they're unattached. Once you have them on, you can shuffle around on flat ground or even move uphill a bit by pushing off like an ice skater does, or using poles if you have them.\n\nSnowboards are a bit different. Strap in your front foot (left if you ride standard, right if goofy) and leave it attached all the time, but leave your back foot free to push yourself around on flat ground.\n\nGetting on to a lift isn't difficult. After queuing, when you're second in line, you'll wait behind a marked line so the preceding chair can pass in front of you. As soon as it does, shuffle your way up to the next \"wait here\" line. The chair will come up behind you, and you just plop your bottom in to it as it scoops you up. Lift your feet so your skis\/snowboard don't drag until you're up in the air.\n\nGetting off lifts is a bit trickier. As you approach the top, there's a bit of an uphill so you don't catch your skis\/board, followed by a flat section. On skis, just point your skis straight forward; on a snowboard, turn sideways so you're facing straight, put your back foot on the board next to the bindings, and put your weight on your front foot. As the chair moves forward it will give you a bit of a push down the hill, and you're off. Once on flat ground, move out of the way as soon as you can so that others can dismount without running in to you.\n\nMany beginners have a hard time dismounting without falling, so don't feel bad about it. But, if you do fall, try to fall forwards away from the lift and other people. If you stop too close to either, the lift operator will slow down or stop the lift to make sure no one gets hurt, which delays everyone else. It's a normal (sometimes frequent) occurrence, particularly on beginner slopes, but it's good etiquette to do your best not to delay others.\n\nNow it's time to head downhill. On skis, beginners are often taught \"french fries (skis parallel to each other) to go fast, pizza (skis pointed towards each other downhill) to slow down\". This basic technique is enough to let you regulate your speed and even do basic turns. As you get more advanced, you should learn how to stop and turn by keeping both skis parallel and sliding sideways, much like how ice skaters stop.\n\nOn a snowboard, you first need to stop and strap in your back foot. Once you do this, you can try to stand up, although keeping your balance while doing so may be difficult. For beginners it may be easier to hold your board in the air and roll over on to your stomach, so that you can stand up backwards instead of forwards.\n\nFor snowboarders, \"forwards\" means turned to the side with your lead food (left foot if standard, right if goofy) furthest down the hill, and your back foot furthest up the hill. Likewise, \"sideways\" actually means having your chest or back facing straight down the slope. To go very slowly or stop, you can turn sideways and slide down the hill with the long part of your board digging in to slow you down. Turning is done by \"carving\" in with your toes or out with your heels. As you get more advanced, you can learn to control your speed by making S-turns back and forth to lose speed rather than sliding or stopping.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Lessons"]},"\nVirtually all ski resorts have a ski school where you can sign up for lessons.  It's recommended that you learn to ski at a smaller, cheaper mountain nearer to your location before going off to a major ski resort, so you won't have to pay a large fee (at least for a skipass) to just use the bunny hill (which would be the same more or less anywhere).\n\nSome tips that can help you in choosing a right skiing school:\n",{"type":"*","value":["It helps a lot if a school doesn't allow new members to join a group in the middle of a course (i.e. on the 2nd and later days of group training).

Be sure you are properly ",{"type":"'''","value":["protected against the cold"]}," so you will not suffer from frostbite or hypothermia.  When you are skiing you will be exposed to the elements all day and need to act accordingly. If you feel particularly cold, particularly if you begin to shiver, call it a day and head indoors to warm up.\n\nWhen the sun comes out, the reflection from the snow around you can cause serious problems as well!  Be sure to wear ",{"type":"'''","value":["snow goggles or sunglasses"]}," to protect your eyes from snowblindness and wear ",{"type":"'''","value":["sunscreen"]}," to protect yourself from sunburn.  Snow can reflect more than 50% of the light that hits it, so wear sunscreen even if it's cloudy outside!  You'll thank yourself later.\n\nSki terrain can often be very dangerous and can lead to hazards that can potentially injure or kill a careless skier.  ",{"type":"'''","value":["Do not ski any terrain that is above your skill level"]}," and pay attention to all signs and Ski Patrol instructions.  Also heed avalanche warning signs and avoid areas where avalanche buildup can occur.  Also always ski in a group or let someone know where you are.\n\nIf you injure yourself on patrolled terrain, ask a fellow skier to fetch the resort's ski patrol for you. Lift operators can help contact them. Mark the location of an injured person by planting skis or snowboards in an upright cross just uphill.\n\nSee also ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Altitude sickness"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["With children"]},"\nNormally children are accepted to a skiing school from 3 years old.\n\nWhen choosing a destination and accommodation to travel with a 1..1.5-years toddler, consider the following aspects:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" dining in your hotel is much easier and time-saving than going out.
