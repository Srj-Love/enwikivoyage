Drammen is where the Drammen river runs into the Drammensfjord, an arm of the Oslofjord. The part north of the river is called Bragernes, the part south of the river is called Strømsø.

The city was also dubbed the biggest road intersection in Norway, due to the heavy traffic. Today the industry is gone or cleaned, and the traffic passes on highways outside the city. So Drammen today is a nice city, and a pleasant side-trip from Oslo. Or a destination of its own. The city has a long history as a centre for timber-trade and paper production.
