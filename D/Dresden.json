The last Saxon king abdicated in 1918.\n\nThree quarters of the historical centre of Dresden was destroyed by Allied bombing towards the end of the Second World War in 1945. More than 30,000 people died in the fire-storms - the exact number is unknown. These traumatic events are still remembered each year in processions and ceremonies. For many years the ruins - and now the newly rebuilt Frauenkirche with its gold cupola donated by the former British enemies - acted as a call for peace among the different nations of the world.The historical centre is nowadays largely restored to its former glory but some parts are still under reconstruction. \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:DD-blick-von-frauenkirche.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["View over the Elbe"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Present "]},"\nDresden gets about ten million tourists a year, most from Germany.

In the city center The \"Prager Straße\" and the \"Kulturpalast\" are examples for classical GDR architecture.
