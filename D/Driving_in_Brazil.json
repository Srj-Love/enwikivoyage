Also, due to the lack of sufficient highway\/traffic police staff, it is easy to witness drivers doing otherwise forbidden actions such as driving on the shoulder, going above the speed limit, overtaking in dangerous situations, etc., but this does not apply to most drivers. Brazilians drive on the right side of the road, with the steering wheel on the left side. Most cars are manual; automatic ones are in general more expensive.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Roads "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Rodovia ayrton senna da silva em itaquaquecetuba.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["250px"],["Highways in Brazil may range from fine, like this one near São Paulo..."]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:BR-174.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["250px"],["...to awful, like this one in Northern Brazil."]]},"\nRoads that connect one state to another are federal highways known as BR-000, in which \"000\" should be replaced by another three-digit number. If this number starts with 0, then the highway starts at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brasília"]]}," and run towards the extremes of the country; highways starting with 1 run north-south, whereas the ones starting with 2 cross the country from east-west; highways starting with 3 run northwest-southeast or northeast-southwest. There are also the ones starting with 4, which run in any direction, and the ones starting with 6, which are always short.\n\nRoads can be government-financed only, or they may have some tolls. The price may vary from R$1.50 to R$20.00, depending on the road, the number of booths spread along the highway and the type of vehicle you are driving. Prices are usually displayed at the booths and in signs placed a few kilometers before each of them.\n\nMany highways have speed guns to prevent motorists from going too fast, but their presence and the speed limits must be informed according to the law. However, their exact location may remain unknown for motorists, so it's always best to respect the signs.\n\nHighways may become congested during the beginning and the end of holidays, or during rush hour, if they run near major cities. If the traffic stops inside a tunnel and there's no sign that you are going to move too soon, drivers are advised to turn the engine off. There are usually fewer cars late at night, but due to the low visibility, it also becomes more dangerous, especially for unexperienced drivers. Motorists should also be careful with truck drivers, since many of them sleep very few hours a day and may fall asleep at the wheel.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Signs "]},"\nBrazilian road and traffic signs in general follow the international conventions. STOP signs are in general similar to the ones found in the English-speaking world, except that obviously they will be displaying the word PARE (stop, in Portuguese). These signs require a vehicle be stopped at an intersection and not proceed until the way is clear. Stopping is mandatory, no matter what time of day or the traffic conditions. Sometimes, the PARE sign may be written on the ground, in white letters. The \"give way\" sign is displayed in an equilateral, red-edged triangle pointed downwards. They are normally displayed in accesses to highways or smaller roads, meaning you should only get in if the way is clear.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Road markings "]},"\nRoads can be marked by yellow or white lines. Yellow lined separate each side of the road. In highways, if they are continuous, overtaking is prohibited (though few people respect that). If they are broken, it's OK to overtake. White lines separate lanes. Some may be painted at intersections, marking the point beyond which no vehicle should stop at the red lights.\n\nSome cities have bus lanes. In general, these lanes are forbidden for cars unless the car is a taxi, or during specific times and days. If the bus lane is on the far right lane, vehicles may only use them when entering or exiting the street.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Pedestrian crossings"]},"\nZebra crossings (",{"type":"''","value":["faixas de pedestres"]},") are always painted as white, parallel lines. Some may be even highlighted in other colors such as purple. When there is a zebra crossing with no traffic light, drivers are supposed to stop and wait until the road is totally clear of pedestrians. However, obedience to this law is poor, particularly in major cities. In ",{"type":"[[","value":[["São Paulo"]]},", a recent law has increased police enforcement for this traffic offense and the number of people hit by cars decreased, but the streets may still be dangerous for pedestrians if they do not pay attention.
