Sometimes people do stop to 'discuss' the incident and it is common that the failing driver pay about 100 yuan or so to the other driver, and that is then the end of the matter. If you and the other driver cannot agree on compensation then you must not move the cars until the police arrive, which can take time. This also results in many of the massive traffic jams you will encounter on Chinese roads. Police usually check registration and licenses and photograph the incident. In case of personal injury, you should stop and offer assistance. It is highly unlikely that a person not involved in the accident from the general public will offer any assistance outside of perhaps helping you phone the police. Police response time can be poor or very slow. Chinese are very hesitant to offer assistance because of a supposed fear of being sued and the supposed fact that person who phones for an ambulance must pay the bill. At least this is the conventional wisdom.\n\nBeware of large imported luxury cars.

Furthermore, this will result in drivers jockeying for position and jamming the emergency shoulder adding further waiting time to the traffic jam and potentially more accidents.\n\nAlthough in English, both express routes and expressways are referred to as \"expressways\", their Chinese counterparts are named differently. \"Express routes\" are written 快速公路, whereas expressways are written as 高速公路. The idea is that express routes link of cities and larger municipalities, but expressways do the national work, liaising from one centre to another.\n\nExpress routes have lower speed limits than expressways.

In reality, of course, there are rules; they do generally manage to avoid hitting each other. However, Chinese rules are ",{"type":"''","value":["very"]}," different from what most travellers are used to. To Western eyes, appallingly bad driving is the norm, and insane or suicidal behaviour behind the wheel is fairly common. \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Do not assume that Chinese drivers will follow any rule you know."]}," The rule is much more that they care only for their own vehicle.\n\nForeign drivers must try to adapt to this (or, perhaps more sensibly, give up and take taxis or hire a driver). You do not have to learn to drive like a Chinese, but at least you should not be surprised when they do. There is absolutely no point getting angry if someone cuts you off or drives against the red light or on the wrong side of the road. You simply yield and carry on as if nothing had happened.\n\nEvery car\/driver has a \"body language\" which predicts what they will do next. It is essential to learn this \"body language\" and drive by it. If you are driving down a four lane road, and the lane in front of the taxi to the right of you and slightly ahead of you is blocked, the lane ahead is free, you should immediately assume the taxi will move left into your lane without any warning. This sort of thinking ahead, or defensive driving, can help you avoid many problems but of course you cannot predict everything that may happen.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that there are only two rules you must obey, both equally important. Don't hit anything, and don't get hit by anything.\n\nDespite all the above, driving conditions are not as chaotic as say, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vietnam"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Indonesia"]]},". Many foreigners do drive in China and, after adapting, some feel reasonably comfortable and confident about it.  \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Right of way"]},"\n\nThe concept of right-of-way is quite different in China than in many other countries. \"First is Right,\" or less succinctly, any vehicle with a slight position lead or access to a gap before another vehicle has de-facto right of way to enter that gap. This essentially allows for any driver the habit of cutting right out into the traffic flow forcing the opposing vehicle to either stop or crash. This rule applies to lane changes too that can come at anytime from any angle. Be alert to brake at any moment! If you do not force your way in, you will not ever be allowed to enter the flow of traffic at busy sections. \n\nThe general rule appears to be ",{"type":"''","value":["keep moving no matter what"]},". Cutting people off, swerving into the oncoming lane, driving on the shoulder, or in a fenced-off bicycle lane, or the wrong way down a divided highway are all fine as long as they keep you moving in the right general direction and do not cause an immediate accident. It is even fairly common to see cars, trucks and motorcycles all on the sidewalk along with pedestrians and bikes all going their own separate ways! Taxis are the worst offenders.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Merging"]},": vehicles depart from intersections, side streets, alleys and parking lots, merging onto any road without yielding to traffic already underway on that road (and often apparently without a glance at oncoming traffic). If the merging driver can reach any opening in traffic, the oncoming cars are expected to yield and allow the merge. \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Lane Changes"]},": lane changes and turns are more often than not signaled, but then the \"first is right\" rule reigns, and yielding is expected of a trailing vehicle, even if only trailing by a small margin. Imagine where the collision dent will be: if someone enters your lane and you strike the ",{"type":"''","value":["side"]}," of their vehicle, it will be assumed that you failed to yield even though they cut you off.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Left turns"]},": at intersections, upon a red-to-green light change, vehicles intending to turn left across straight-through traffic will usually enter the intersection to accomplish their turn before straight-through traffic can proceed. Allowing the turning vehicle(s) to complete the maneuver is the best practice. Such turns are aided by the yellow-before-green traffic light sequence common in China. Furthermore, observe this protocol and use a red-to-green light change as de-facto Left Turn Arrow. If possible use a leading turning vehicle as a shield. Be aware that vehicles behind you (using you as a shield) will often try to veer to either side of you, completing their turn without regard for your situation.\n\nAs always, \"first is right\"; trailing traffic is expected to yield. In other words, a \"new\" green light is usually regarded as a \"left arrow\".\n\nRegarding left-hand turns in general; a vehicle desiring to turn left across oncoming traffic will not yield to oncoming, established traffic and await a \"safe\" opening. Any opening may be exploited, the required minimum size of the opening apparently depends on the left turning driver's sense of self-preservation (larger vehicles and poorer quality vehicles will take more chances). Oncoming vehicles that slow in wariness of a possible ill-advised turn, will often prompt the turning driver to commit. Oncoming drivers are advised to continue without pause, while preparing for heavy braking or lane changes to accommodate the turner.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Car-pedestrian interactions"]}," are complicated; ubiquitous pedestrians, bikes, and cycles, often acting negligent or even oblivious toward surrounding traffic, are generally considered to have possessed Right of Way in any collision between them and a vehicle. If a larger vehicle strikes a pedestrian or rider, the larger vehicle will generally be assumed liable. Bearing that in mind, vehicles will use their speed and security advantage, and often the horn, to maneuver through even densely occupied crossings. Aware pedestrians will generally expect a vehicle will force through a walk way, and are often confused if the vehicle halts to allow them passage. Painted cross walks (white bars painted on road ways) are not typically observed as \"pedestrian protected\" areas, but woe to a driver who strikes a pedestrian there. Never assume a driver will actually stop for you at a marked crossing. Drivers will actually push anything in front of them off the sidewalk or side of the road, it is assumed you will move out of ",{"type":"''","value":["their"]}," way.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Running red lights "]},"\n\nChinese drivers routinely go through red lights if there is no opposing traffic. Pedestrians do not count as traffic; just honk at them to get out of the way or swerve around them. It is also moderately common to run red lights even in the presence of other traffic. The only places where this does not apply is if a visible road-rule enforcement camera is seen, or if the police is around. Even here, the law does actually permit emergency vehicles to run red lights as well, but most suspects not on duty will also include government and military vehicles, and even diplomats!\n\nA retired teacher in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lanzhou"]]}," became a bit of a hero on the Chinese Internet in 2009 with his campaign to make an intersection near his home safer.

These drivers are paid by how many trips they make and because of this they are notorious among Chinese and expatriates for running red lights, seemingly without slowing down. They will also most likely be abominably overloaded, almost certainly for (illegitimate!) economic reasons as well.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Two-way traffic everywhere "]},"\n\nBicycles and motorcycles and sometimes cars ignore one-way signs. On divided highways, seeing pedestrians, bicycles and motorcycles going the wrong way down the shoulder is entirely normal, and a few go the wrong way beside the center fence. At traffic circles (roundabouts), drivers hate going around the island in the middle if they can avoid it; they will often just swing left instead. Lane markings are also routinely ignored; for example, taxis often go straight through an intersection via a lane marked as left turn only, because that gets them past other cars.\n\nOn newer roads there may be, for example, a roughly triangular traffic island southwest of an actual intersection. Two sides are roads; the third is a curving lane intended for drivers making a right turn form eastbound to southbound. In China, drivers turning left from northbound to westbound routinely use that lane.\n\nMany Chinese cities have bicycle lanes fenced off on either side of the road. These lanes will carry two-way traffic regardless of the direction of the traffic flow: including bicycles and motorcycles plus the occasional car, truck and pedestrians. Cars routinely take to these lanes if traffic in the main lanes is jammed; they then honk at bicyclists to force them out of the way using their horn as a form of \"sonic plow\" clearing the way in front of them. The driver is operating under the assumption you will move and if you don't move in a timely fashion you are risking being struck down if walking or on a bicycle and will most likely be blamed. \n\nEven the sidewalks often carry two-way bicycle and motorcycle traffic, plus the odd car going to or from a parking spot. Cars again operate under the assumption they own the sidewalk and its up to you to get out of their way. Again, even on the sidewalks, vehicles honk at pedestrians to get them out of ",{"type":"''","value":["their"]}," way.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Lights on"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:G106-Dajipu-to-Daye-hills-0071.jpg"],["thumb"],["A roadside inscription reminds residents that public roadways should not be used for threshing or drying agricultural produce"]]},"\nLorry drivers may not bother with switching on lights at night.

Except on some freeways, driving at night is unpleasant and dangerous. Avoid it if at all possible.\n\nWhen driving at night, be very aware that people often walk in the middle of the road, with the back to the oncoming traffic, in dark clothes.

Motorcycles often run at night without lights.

There can also be licensing complications; for example in some cities (such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beijing"]]},",) only motorcycles registered within the metropolitan area can be legally ridden.\n\nMost Chinese motorcycles are 125 cc, with 50, 90 and 150 also moderately common. There are also many scooters and three-wheel motorcycle-based cargo vehicles, most with 125 cc engines. At least in some cities you cannot register anything larger than 250 cc. A 125 cc plain-jane Suzuki sells for around ¥4000 ($600 US). A fancier bike with road racer or off-road pretensions would be a bit more, a Chinese brand somewhat less. Some Chinese companies build their own chassis but buy engine\/transmission assemblies from Suzuki or Honda; these are probably the best value. Of course, at the lowest end are simply bicycles that have been fitted with engines to function like motorcycles, something probably seen only in China.\n\nYou can also find imported Japanese bikes in most cities. Look on the outskirts for motorcycle repair shops and eventually you will find one with some older model XR's or CBR's or the like. A 10 year old CBR400 should be about ¥4000 in good shape. The Honda XR250 is also fairly common but are a bit more expensive around ¥10,000 for a 5 to 8 year old bike. The laws are not very clear on these bikes, if you buy one be careful of the police they may confiscate the bike. In 2006, a few foreigners in Shanghai were detained and evicted for unlicensed riding.\n\nFew imported motorcycles meet the homologation requirements, including some BMW and Honda.

While they lack the horsepower and range of a motorcycle, they are quieter, cleaner, lighter, and easier to maintain. Beware however that while in terms of emission and noise pollution they are a welcome choice for China's overcrowded and choked urban roads, but they are very very silent and often you will not hear them coming at all until its too late. This of course makes the danger of a serious collision with a pedestrian common. Scooters come with a battery (or batteries) that are usually removable as well as rechargeable from a household outlet. At least in some cities, these vehicles are licensed as a bicycle so one does not need a driver's license to ride them and may take advantage of bike lanes and sidewalks (if present) to circumvent traffic. However, like motorcycles, some cities have banned them. The alleged reason is that many motorised bikes are being used in bag snatch crimes. Others suggest it is to make room for people with cars and people movers. Do not expect the majority of electro-bike riders to ever use the headlights at night or dusk.\n\nScooters are a target for thieves, so always ensure that one of the wheels or, ideally, both are secured with a solid lock. Batteries as well are liable to be stolen and should be locked to the scooter with the built-in mechanism or stored indoors while not in use. Some residences allow for scooters to be brought indoors overnight, which is preferable.\n\nThe bulk of used scooter sales are increasingly conducted over the Internet. Native Chinese who are knowledgeable in such matters should be able to direct you to a good website for your particular city. Be sure to understand what to look for when purchasing a used scooter. Most importantly, a scooter's battery, like all batteries, will lose its ability to hold a charge over time. It is often possible to purchase a new battery for a used bike.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Usabletopic"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["PartOfTopic"],["Driving"],["China"]]}]
