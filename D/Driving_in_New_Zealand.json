It is easy to underestimate the time needed for travel.\n\nThe local Automobile Association (AA) publishes a travelling time guide that suggests average travelling speeds in the range of 50–70 km\/h should be considered if travel is to be enjoyed.

Broken or dotted lines indicate lanes and centre lines. As a general rule, it is permissible to cross a broken white line, while a solid white line indicates some road rule limits when that line should be crossed.\n\nYellow centre lines are used to indicate when passing or crossing the centre line is not permitted. Broken yellow lines on the side of the road are used to indicate ",{"type":"''","value":["No Stopping"]}," areas or parking spaces reserved for special vehicles.\n\nControlled intersections (traffic lights or signs) have ",{"type":"''","value":["limit lines"]}," that vehicles need to stop behind at these intersections (officially, you must stop with your front wheels behind the line - your front bumper is allowed over the line). These lines are often set back a few metres from the intersection itself and if you cross the line, say at a right turn, your vehicle may not be detected by the traffic light sensors and you may not get the green light.\n\nDiagonal, often yellow, cross hatchings in an intersection shows that the exit to the intersection often is blocked, and you must not obstruct the intersection by stopping in the (marked) area of the intersection, though this rule applies at every intersection, marked or not.\n\nLarge diagonal white lines in the centre of the road indicate a 'flush median'. This may be used only when turning right, never for overtaking.\n\nBus lanes are often, though not always, painted green. Cars should not be driven in bus lanes unless a sign indicates permission; some bus lanes may be open to cars that are carrying passengers or travelling at certain times of the day or week. You may travel for 50 metres in a bus lane if you have just entered a road or are going to turn left within this distance.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Pedestrian crossings"]},"\nAt pedestrian crossings (zebra crossings), white parallel lines are painted across the road. A white diamond is usually painted on the road before pedestrian crossing, together with warning signs and amber flashing lights or round orange reflectors on black and white striped poles at the crossing.\n\nDrivers must stop for pedestrians waiting at the crossing. This applies to the ",{"type":"'''","value":["whole"]}," crossing and pedestrians on both sides of the road, even if the white centreline passes through the crossing or there is a painted centre median.

Other major cities such as Wellington also have traffic jams around 08:00  and 17:00 on key roads in and out of the city. At off-peak times driving from the city to the airport can take 25 min.  In peak times it can take up to an hour, but generally 40 min, to travel the same route. There are areas of extensive road building\/improvements through the city and can cause delays where they meet the existing network. Note that particularly in Auckland but anywhere in the country, roads do not often follow a grid pattern and fog can be an early-morning obstacle. Remain alert.\n\nThere are generally very few one-way streets in New Zealand, but most of them are located in the cities' central business districts, so beware of them while driving there as they are not always obvious. Be particularly careful in Wellington where not only one-way streets but also bus-only streets exist. Also, be particularly careful of the unusually high kerbs in Wellington, which can cause a driver to scrape the paintwork or undercarriage of the car when normally they would expect only the tires to hit the kerb.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Open road"]},"\nDue to the low population density, motorways (freeways) and expressways in New Zealand are concentrated around the major cities of Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. The Waikato Expressway from southern Auckland to Hamilton is the only substantive inter-city expressway, and even then it is only 80% complete, with two sections of two-lane undivided road in the middle of it. Elsewhere, New Zealand highways are mainly two-lane undivided sealed roads.\n\nThe speed limit on the main highways and motorways is 100 km\/h for cars, but only 90 km\/h for buses and trucks (this is any vehicle over 3500 kg (7700 lb), including large camper-vans) and vehicles towing trailers. Some semi-rural roads have 70 km\/h or 80 km\/h limits, especially approaching and leaving urban areas. The Auckland Harbour Bridge and the Central Motorway Junction in Auckland have an 80 km\/h limit.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:New Zealand RG-2.1.svg"],["thumb"],["upright"],["\"Open road\" sign"]]},"\nSome roads have a ",{"type":"'''","value":["Limited Speed Zone"]}," or ",{"type":"'''","value":["LSZ"]},".  This means the speed limit changes depending on the conditions. In good conditions, with light traffic, the speed limit can be the open road limit of 100 km\/h, but it drops to 50 km\/h if there is a lot of traffic, the weather is poor or there are people on the roadside. A ",{"type":"'''","value":["LSZ"]}," will often be found in the transition zones between town and country, though most have now been replaced with 70 km\/h zones.\n\nBe aware not all road signs follow the international standard and \"open-road-signs\" are still in use in less used roads. These are white signs with a black stripe across them which denote a 100 km\/h zone. But, like the LSZ, drivers are expected to adjust their speed in bad conditions (it is unlikely that you will be fined for travelling at 100 km\/h even in relatively bad conditions on the \"open road\"). However, caution is advised as many of these roads are in comparatively poor condition with potholes, etc. making some of them dangerous even at the best of times).\n\nBe careful when turning into side roads while in rural areas. Stopping in the middle of the road while waiting to turn often results in a rear collision. Drivers may wait to the left of the road instead of the middle.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:New Zealand PW-66 (2 chevrons left).svg"],["thumb"],["Warning sign showing the suggested speed for an upcoming curve"]]},"\nRural roads can vary dramatically. Most State Highways and rural roads can be winding, fast, have one lane on each side of the road, and have tight corners. While the speed limit is a freeway-like (100 km\/h), the conditions are more dangerous than freeways as there is no barrier separating you from oncoming traffic. Modern sections of rural State Highway (built or rebuilt since the mid-1980s) are usually built to a high standard with wide lanes and shoulders, and fast curves designed to be taken at 100 km\/h, although they are still only one lane in each direction with no median barrier. Oblong black and yellow arrow signs with a number (e.g. \"65\") approximately indicate the tightness of an upcoming turn; the number indicates an appropriate speed (in km\/h) to travel at through the corner. (Two separate signs showing the curve and its suggested speed are also commonly used.) In good conditions an experienced driver may be able to take the bend at up to 10–20 km\/h more than the marked speed. However for signs reading 45 or less the speed advice should be taken literally as all 45 km\/h turns are tight corners and it is hard to remain in your lane at above this speed. Also in bad weather it is often necessary to follow precisely the advice of all these signs.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Legal issues and safety"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Speed"]},"\nIn general a 10 km\/h allowance is made for inaccurate speedometers, so many drivers travel at 100–104 km\/h on the open road. Officially though, the Police have a no-tolerance policy and can issue tickets for any speed over the limit. Police will fine you for only going 5 km\/h over the speed limit if you are caught speeding near a school, and during holiday periods and long weekends. Further, police occasionally issue fines (infringement notices) for driving at or below the sign-posted speed limits when there is no need to and also where a vehicle's speed is excessive for the driving conditions (e.g. in crowded streets in town centres or on icy roads).\n\nTravelling more than ",{"type":"'''","value":["40 km\/h"]}," over any speed limit is considered dangerous driving and will result in arrest, suspension of driver's licence and possible impounding of the vehicle if caught by police. Failing to stop for Police when directed (e.g. flashing red and blue lights\/siren) may also result in an arrest, as New Zealand Police will pursue a fleeing vehicle unless doing so would endanger other road users.\n\nThe police operate a dedicated ",{"type":"''","value":["Highway Patrol"]}," who have the responsibility of enforcing traffic laws and assist at accidents. These vehicles are marked in yellow, blue and white (rather than the orange, blue and white of other police vehicles). Unmarked (or mufti) patrol vehicles are also used. However, all Police officers are expected to stop offending motorists if traffic offending is observed. However, it is rare for (non-Highway Patrol) Police officers to concentrate on offences other than speeding. Police officers are required to ensure a steady flow of traffic by ensuring overly slow drivers pull over and let traffic past; however, this behaviour is rarely observed.\n\nSpeed cameras operate from the back of unmarked cars and vans and from camera boxes in fixed positions.  Police also use hand-held laser speed guns and may operate hidden speed cameras. An innocent looking parked van or car or that cream or silver box on a pole at the side of the road may or may not contain a camera – best to assume that it does. The official policy is to target those areas with disproportionately high accident statistics.\n\nTake extra care at observing speed limits as you pass through small towns. There are often speed cameras just past where the speed limit drops to 50 km\/h, such as the fixed speed cameras entering Bulls from the south as with Palmerston North.\n\nAlso be sure to obey temporary speed restrictions put in place for road works and special events, even when there is no evidence of work actually in progress. When resealing has taken place, the limit is often left in place for a couple of weeks until loose stones have disappeared or been swept. Being caught driving at more than 80 km\/h in a temporary 30 km\/h zone will lead to automatic loss of driving licence plus a heavy fine. Do not be surprised if long lengths of highway have 30 km\/h restrictions despite there not being any sign of road works or workmen; this is notoriously commonplace to drivers' frustration.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Drinking and driving"]},"\nNew Zealand Police strictly enforce alcohol limits for drivers (80mg of alcohol per 100mL of blood for drivers 20yr and over, zero for drivers under 20). Police often set up checkpoints, sometimes around a whole city centre, and even on motorways. Any and every traffic stop is also an opportunity for testing for drink-driving. Police use ",{"type":"''","value":["breath alcohol test"]}," devices to detect drivers who have been drinking. Drivers who fail these roadside screening tests will be asked to undertake an evidential breath and\/or blood alcohol test. Refusal will result in arrest.\n\nThe New Zealand Parliament has unanimously agreed to lower the alcohol limit to 50mg, although the legislative process means it will be at least August 2014 before any change comes into effect.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Seatbelts"]},"\nWearing seatbelts in cars and vans is compulsory. There are very limited exceptions for medical reasons (with a medical certificate), taxi drivers and some antique cars. All passengers above the age of 16 years old are responsible for wearing their own seatbelts. The driver is responsible for ensuring children, especially under 8's, are restrained in approved child restraints, if they are too small for an ordinary seat belt. If you are in a car, even a taxi, buckle up. You could be fined $150 if you are not wearing your seatbelt, even as a passenger.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Overtaking"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:DrivinginNZ.JPG"],["thumbnail"],["Rural road near Lake Tekapo"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Nzroadneartekapo.JPG"],["thumbnail"],["Rural South Island roads"]]},"\nMost of New Zealand's roads are single carriageways with only one lane in each direction, few median barriers. Passing (or ",{"type":"''","value":["overtaking"]},") lanes do exist, but are mainly confined to major routes and are often fairly short (rarely over 1000 metres long). Passing lanes may sometimes be legally used by vehicles overtaking in the opposite direction too (but only when the lane is clear- traffic on the same side of the centre line as the passing lane has right of way). This depends on whether the centreline markings have double yellow lines (no crossing) or a single yellow line with a white broken line (crossing permitted from the white line side only), so keep to the left whilst driving in a passing lane except when overtaking.\n\nExcept at intersections, where vehicles are turning right, overtaking vehicles must pass on the right. People often overtake by driving on the opposite side of the road. If you choose to overtake then make sure you spend as little time as possible on the opposite side of the road and only overtake when you can maintain at least 100 metres visibility throughout the whole manoeuvre. However, you must take care not to exceed the speed limit at all times, as speeding up to minimise the time spent on the wrong side of the road, will still be viewed by Police officers as dangerous.\n\nWhere overtaking is not allowed, the road is marked with a solid yellow line adjacent and to the left of the white dotted centreline. It is illegal to overtake in these zones unless you can do so without crossing the centreline. Never cross a yellow no overtaking line to overtake as these are often the only indication of a hidden dip in the road ahead. These hidden dips could be hiding oncoming traffic that would be impossible to avoid.\n\nOn multi-lane roads, each lane is considered a separate road-way and passing on the left can occur provided you stay within the marked lanes. Slower vehicles are expected to travel in the left lane(s) when multiple lanes travel in the same direction, but may not, for example in heavy traffic, or due to convenience of not having to switch lanes. Also a driver is legally obligated, where possible to drive in the left hand lane, however this is rarely if ever enforced.\n\nOn two lane roads, slower vehicles are legally obliged to allow faster following traffic to pass when it queues behind them, whenever there is an opportunity to do so. Vehicles will often pull to the left edge of the road and indicate a left signal briefly. However, this behaviour is becoming less widespread, and Police officers will never enforce this obligation.\n\nOvertaking is a notable feature of intercity travel in New Zealand due to the lack of multi-lane motorways.

Most school buses have a yellow and black sign saying \"SCHOOL\" on the front and back, but there are no other warning signs or marking different from any other bus on the road; school buses lack distinctive colouring and are never painted yellow (unless that's the colour scheme of the bus company).
