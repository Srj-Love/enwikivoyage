In winter, a four-wheel drive may be useful to pull up the last snowy road, but is generally not needed on public roads. In winter, Norwegian cars use Nordic quality winter tires (studded tires are permitted from November 1). Chains are generally not used by ordinary cars. Satellite navigation (GPS) can be useful in cities and around Oslo, but navigation by road number is more reliable.

If you live in Europe, consider bringing your own, but if you arrive during winter (November - April), be aware that winter tires are necessary, do not under any circumstance try to drive without, even if you don't expect snow or ice. Winter tires must have a minimum of 3 mm deep grooves. Cars heavier than 3500 kg are required to bring snow chains during winter and whenever snow or ice can be expected, a minimum of 5 mm tread pattern depth is recommended for trucks and heavy cars.

Look for parkings that are specifically designed for campervans. Don't park on any field or open patch along the road as land is generally private.\n\nThere are hundreds of camp grounds that cater to motorhomes (and caravans, or camping with tents - some have huts to rent), and these are well signposted. All have basic facilities (electricity, toilets, hot showers (pay per minute), mostly-flat ground), and some are more equipped (buy fresh food, hire boats, communal kitchens, tourist info, etc.). \n\nSome are of the \"industrial\" variety (hundreds of vans, spotless facilities, very straight paths, gravel, not grass, keypads to enter, lots of strict rules, right beside the highway), and others are more... loose - occasional visitors, honor system for payment, idyllic surroundings, lots of grass and space. It's impossible to tell from the signs, so a drive-by might be necessary to see if the campground suits your mood and preferences. \n\nAs a rough guide (August 2011), a night in a campground with electricity costs around kr. 200, but ranges from kr. 120 to kr. 300.Showers are usually kr.10 for 4 minutes.\n\nThere are many rest stops on all major and many minor roads, and there's a fantastic system of National Tourist Routes with particularly spectacular rest stops (and facilities). Most of the rests tops have a toilet and picnic table.\n\nBe aware that many campervans have relatively small engines and will be slower than other vehicles on the many Norwegian hills.

Compact cars with modest engines are the most fuel efficient. Car ferries is an additional cost, and unavoidable on several roads (particularly in the western fjords and parts of Northern Norway). Most ferry crossings are relatively short (10-25 minutes) and rates on ferries are moderate compared the overall cost of renting a car - notable exceptions are the special tourist ferries Gudvangen-Kaupanger and Geiranger-Hellesylt\/Valldal.
