If you drive without lights you may find other drivers flashing their headlights at you to inform you. \n\nFrom 1 December - 31 March Swedish registered cars in use are required by law to have either studded tires or un-studded winter friction tires. The tires must be marked, M+S, M-s, M.S, M&S, MS or Mud and Snow. This rule is valid only if the roads are considered to be in \"winter conditions\" by the local police, but that is so common in this period that you should not be without such tires.\n\nAlthough foreign registered cars are formally exempt from this requirement, it is still strongly recommended when driving in Sweden during the winter. The police may stop foreign registered cars without winter tires on road safety grounds, if the conditions are too bad.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Roads"]},"\nThe European road network goes through ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sweden"]]},", and mostly have higher standard than national or local roads.

Major ones are numbered 100-400, and minor  ones with higher numbers.\n\nRoads with numbers below 400 are marked. Roads with lower numbers are situated south of the roads with higher numbers.\n\nThe small ones, and in some cases 4 digit roads that might show up on your GPS map are never marked with their numbers. They are just numbered for some administrative purpose and the numbers cannot be used while driving.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Finding Directions"]},"\nThe best markings are made with big blue signs with the name of the upcoming towns.\nIf the road leading there is a freeway, the signs are green instead of blue.\nUnless you are going on a very big road, make your directions based on what towns or villages you are passing and keep an eye out for these signs instead of the road numbers.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Speed Limits"]},"\nThe current speed limit is very well marked by signs. The speed limit signs are in km\/h. The signs you see are normally 30, 50, 70, 90 and 110. Recently, new speed limits have appeared, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120. Two speed signs on each side of the road mean from this point this is the new speed. One sign on the right means that this is the speed on this road but there is no change in speed.\n\nThe standard speed for roads outside built-up areas is always 70 km\/h unless otherwise indicated.\n\nSince 2001 some new signs have been introduced or have been altered to also indicate the speed limit. These are:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The Freeway (Motorväg) sign now also means 110km\/h."]},{"type":"*","value":[" The Highspeed road (Motortrafikled) sign indicates 90 km\/h (100 km\/h on roads with cable fence between the lanes(since 2008.))."]},{"type":"*","value":[" The new start of village sign means 50km\/h."]},{"type":"*","value":[" The new end of village sign means 70km\/h."]},"\nWith the adding of new speed limits in 2008 the signs mentioned above now follow these rules:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The Freeway (Motorväg) sign is now always posted together with a sign indicating the speed limit for this road."]},{"type":"*","value":[" The start of village sign is also always posted together with a speed limit sign."]},"\nThe respect for obeying the speed limit is rather poor. \nOften, when you driving at the correct speed on a 70 or 90km\/h road you will constantly get passed by other cars or be urged to get out of the way to let them pass. On the other hand, speeding on 30 km\/h roads is not accepted. If caught, speeding will cost you from 1500 kr (about €160) (1-10 km\/h too fast) to 4000 kr (about €430) (36-40 km\/h too fast) on 70 km\/h or faster roads.

The biggest roads normally have fences against wild animals, but the smaller roads do not. You need to look out for deer and moose – you do not want a half-a-ton animal coming through the windscreen. Steer behind the animal, as it might run forward when scared.

In such cases and in other places where wild animals are often seen there are normally warning signs.\n\nThese animals are mostly moving at dusk and dawn. While driving along lakes be especially observant as animals go for drinks at the lakes. Also, if driving in the September hunting season, the wild animals might be scared by hunting parties and move around more than usual.\n\nIf you hit an animal and it wanders off into the woods wounded, don't forget to mark the spot where it wandered into the forest and call the police. Hitting an animal is not a crime, but not reporting it is. Your car must be fitted with a special paper ribbon for this purpose. The purpose for this is to be able to use dogs to hunt down the wounded animal.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Road signs"]},"\nSweden follows the same convention as the rest of Europe regarding road signs, therefore they are more or less the same as for the rest of Europe (the colours vary somewhat).\n\nThe road signs in Europe differ substantially to those e.g. in the Americas.
