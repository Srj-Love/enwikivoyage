Thus, America's love affair with the automobile was born. American consumer car culture truly took off in the 1950's, in a global market dominated by American car manufacturers such as Ford, General Motors and Chrysler. Public transportation networks in many American cities declined or were dismantled as the popularity of private car ownership exploded.\n\nToday, the vast majority of adult Americans own cars, and driving is usually the most popular way of getting around American cities, as well as between nearby cities. Compared to European and East Asian cities of similar population sizes, public transportation in American cities tends to be unreliable and infrequent, so renting or bringing your own car is usually a very good idea. This is true even of most of the very large cities like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Los Angeles"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Atlanta"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Miami"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Detroit"]]},".\n\nWith the exception of military and scientific usage, the United States does not use the metric system, instead retaining its US customary units. This means that road distances are indicated in miles, and speed limits as indicated in miles per hour (mph). For those who are more familiar with the metric system, 1 mile is equal to 1.609 km. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Canada"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mexico"]]}," both use the metric system, but automobile speedometers normally will display both units.\n\nFuel (which Americans refer to as \"gas\" or \"gasoline\", not \"petrol\") is dispensed in US gallons. A US gallon (3.78 litres) is four fifths of an Imperial gallon. US fuel prices tend to be lower than those in Canada or Europe due to differing levels of taxation.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Traffic laws"]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["Driving laws"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["The American highway rainbow"],["2=While the states establish their own traffic laws, and are each responsible for the maintenance and signage along their roads, the federal government does provide certain standards for highway signage and markings.

However, most visitors are allowed to drive on their foreign license when visiting on short trips if it is written in English. Licenses not written in English generally have to be accompanied by an Internation Driving Permit (IDP) or a certified translation before you are allowed to drive.\n\nFor longer stays, you may be required to convert your foreign license to a local one in the state you are residing in. The actual requirements vary from state to state, but most foreign license holders would be required to sit for theory and practical tests before their licenses can be converted. The list of countries whose license holders are exempt from testing requirements varies from state to state.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Speed limits"]},"\nSpeed limits are usually about 30-35 mph on most city roads. Freeway speed limits usually range from 45-85 mph. Many interstate freeways mandate a minimum speed of 40 mph.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Road networks"]},"\n\nRoads in the US are generally well maintained. The US is criss-crossed by a large network of freeways known as interstate highways, meaning that travelling between nearby cities is usually a breeze. As most Americans drive to get around their respective cities, most major cities are also covered by a dense network of elevated freeways.\n\nAs with major cities around the world, congestion can be expected during the morning and evening peak hours in American cities. Nevertheless, due to the unreliability of public transport in most American cities, driving is still the most convenient way of getting around.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Interstate System"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:US Roadsigns.JPG"],["thumb"],["250px"],["There's always a road going your way."]]},"\n\nThe United States is covered with a convenient system of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Interstate highways"]},".  Interstates are always expressways (or \"freeways\")—that is, controlled access divided highways with no grade crossings, the equivalent of what Europeans call a \"motorway\". These roads connect all of the major population centers, and they make it easy to cover long distances—or get to the other side of a large city  quickly.\n\nPrimary Interstates have one- or two-digit numbers, with odd ones running north-south (e.g. I-5) and even ones running east-west (e.g. I-80).  Three-digit interstate numbers designate shorter, secondary routes.  An odd first digit signifies a \"spur\" into or away from a city; an even first digit signifies a \"loop\" around a large city. The second two digits remain the same as the primary Interstate that travels nearby (e.g., I-495 is a loop that connects to I-95).\n\nThe vast majority of Interstates do not charge tolls, but several eastern states operate cross-state Interstate toll roads called ",{"type":"'''","value":["Turnpikes"]}," (or the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Thruway"]}," in New York).  Other states have also started to implement tolls to defray their maintenance costs.  While the majority of these tolls can still be paid in cash (no credit cards or traveler's checks), states are increasingly turning to electronic tolling.  Ask your rental car agency or auto club about the tolling options available to you.\n\nSpeed limits on the interstate highways can vary from state to state, and also according to geography (for example, slower on mountain passes and within cities than on long straight rural sections). Posted speed limits can range from as low as 45 miles per hour (70 km\/h) in densely urban areas to as much as 85 miles per hour (135 km\/h) in rural stretches of Texas, but mostly they'll be between 65 and 75 mph (105–120 km\/h). The speed limits (in miles per hour) are always clearly posted on interstates.\n\nAmerican drivers often drive 5 to 10 miles per hour (8–16 km\/h) over the posted speed limit; driving slower than the speed limit can actually be dangerous. A good rule of thumb is to avoid driving much faster than 5 mph (8 km\/h) over the speed limit, and be sure that some other cars are always passing you; avoid being the fastest ",{"type":"''","value":["or"]}," the slowest vehicle.  It is customary for the slowest traffic to keep to the right while faster traffic passes on the left.  If you are pulled over by police for speeding, the excuse \"Everyone else is speeding too\" will not help. Highway Patrol officers are usually most concerned with the fastest drivers, so ensuring you are slower than the fastest speeders is one way to avoid their attention. If you are pulled over, be respectful, address the officer as \"Officer,\" and express heartfelt regret at your excessive speed.  You will nearly always get a ticket, but it never hurts to express regret as maybe you will get lucky and only receive a warning.\n\nMany U.S. Interstate Highways, particularly around and through very large cities, will segregate the far left-hand lane or lanes and reserve them for high-occupancy use. These lanes are clearly signed, marked which white diamonds down the center of the lane, typically have double-white lines on the right, and are limited to vehicles with multiple occupants (usually two, sometimes three). High-Occupancy Vehicle lanes, called ",{"type":"''","value":["HOV lanes"]},", are designed to ease congestion on Interstate freeways around large population centers during the very start and very end of the business day, also known colloquially as ",{"type":"''","value":["Rush Hour."]}," Enforcement of these High-Occupancy Vehicle lanes typically coincide with rush-hour, from 7AM to 9AM, and again from 4PM to 6PM on weekdays. Driving in an HOV lane as the sole occupant of a vehicle during these times is could result in a traffic citation and fine.\n\nCommercial rest areas were prohibited on the U.S. Interstate Highway system by the federal government.  As a result, the vast majority of stopping points are state-operated rest areas with public toilets, parking, tourist information, vending machines, and a small picnic area. While there are no restaurants, gas stations, or other stores, some rest areas are equipped with vending machines. (A notable exception are tolled, limited-access highways such as Florida's Turnpike, where exiting would force you to pay a toll; service plazas with both food and gas are found on these highways every 20–40 miles [30–60 km] or so.) Commercial  traveler services tend to congregate on the local roads just off popular interstate exits, even if the exit is miles from the nearest population center.  Sometimes you'll find a ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Truck stops"],["truck stop"]]}]},", an establishment that caters to long-haul truckers but is open to all travelers; Truck stops provide several services all in one building, with a \"greasy-spoon\"-style restaurant, gas station, general store, and even hot showers.  Signs on the highway will indicate the services available at upcoming exits, including gas, food, lodging, and camping, so you can choose a stopping point as you're driving.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Other Highways"]},"\n\nA secondary system of federal highways is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["U.S. Highway system"]},".  U.S. Highways may be freeways on some sections, but they are often surface roads, sometimes with just one lane in each direction. U.S. Highways, which generally predate the Interstate system, tend to be older routes that lead through town centers. In many cases, Interstates were constructed roughly parallel to U.S. Highways to expedite traffic that wishes to bypass the cities and towns. If you don't mind stopping at traffic lights and dealing with pedestrians, U.S. Highways can lead you to some interesting off-the-beaten-path sights.\n\nEach state is responsible for maintenance of the Interstates and U.S. Highways (despite the names), but each one also maintains its own system of ",{"type":"'''","value":["State Highways"]}," (or ",{"type":"'''","value":["State Routes"]},") that form the bulk of the inter-community road network.  State Highways are usually surface roads but may occasionally be freeways; you can generally count on them being well maintained (and plowed in the winter) and that following one will get you to some form of civilization sooner rather than later.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["City Driving"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:High Five.jpg"],["right"],["thumb"],["200px"],["High Five Interchange in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dallas"]]}]]},"\nMost major American cities have a dense network of freeways that lead from the suburbs into the city center. These freeways are usually linked to, or even part of the interstate highway system. Outside of peak hours, driving from the outskirts of the city to the city center is usually a breeze and relatively quick. However, many of these freeways get clogged with traffic during peak hours, and it is not unheard of to be stuck in traffic for 2 hours or more. If you are planning to travel during those periods, give yourself ample time to complete the journey.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Car Rental"]},"\n\nCar rental companies are found in every major American city, and even in many of the small towns. The big international chains such as Hertz, Avis and Budget all offer car rental services in the US. Other local chains that are not so well known internationally include Alamo, National and Action, and these are usually cheaper than the big international chains. Usually, the best deals for car rentals can be found online. Rental prices tend to be higher during major holidays, so book early if you wish to travel during peak periods. Most rental cars in the US are automatic transmission, so unless you specifically specify so, it is unlikely you will get a manual transmission car.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Costs"]},"\n\nGasoline (UK: ",{"type":"''","value":["petrol"]},") prices in the US tend to be cheaper than in Australia or Europe. Currently, gasoline prices tend to fluctuate between $3-4 per gallon. For those who are more familiar the metric system, 1 gallon is roughly equal to 3.8 litres. The US gallon is slightly smaller than the Imperial gallon that British people are familiar with, with 1 US gallon roughly equal to 0.83 Imperial gallons.\n\nMany freeways, both interstate and intra-city are toll roads. Tolls can usually be paid by cash, though most car rental companies in the Northeast will allow you to rent an E-Z pass, which automates toll collection.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Parking"]},"\n\nParking garages (UK: car parks) are found in every major American city, though prices can be somewhat expensive in the larger cities, with prices going as high as over $50 a day in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New York City"]]},".
