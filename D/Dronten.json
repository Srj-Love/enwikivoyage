Drawing from the experiences of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Noordoostpolder"]]},", it was decided that there should be three population centres within the province: the larger town of Dronten and two villages, named after settlements from early Middle Ages that were roughly co-located - Swifterbant and Biddinghuizen.\n\nAs the Flevopolder was drained, important historic and archeological artifacts were unearthed from beneath what was once the bed of the lake, proving that the area that historically alternated between being land or water had settlements even much earlier than was originally thought. It was then established that those belong to what later became called the ",{"type":"''","value":["Swifterbant culture"]},", which inhabited the territories of modern-day Netherlands between about 5300 and 3400 BC.
