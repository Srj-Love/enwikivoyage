Although it has a population of fewer than 400, the village has two public houses, a Thai restaurant and take-away, a café and several bed and breakfast establishments, as well as many self-catering holiday cottages, a general store and Scotland's most southerly post office. A mainly farming area, there are several beautiful beaches, some sandy, a picnic area and a harbour with a few fishing and leisure boats. The local people, despite being known by some as 'Drummorons', are in fact very friendly and helpful.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Drummore Harbour - geograph.org.uk - 692600.jpg"],["thumb"],["Drummore harbour"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By road"]},"\n\nFrom the north: A77\/A716 via ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Stranraer"]]},"; 17 miles.

However, the lanes and paths around the village are well worth exploring on foot, by car or bicycle. A good coastal path is under construction (2012) which will go from the Mull of Galloway to Stranraer to join the Loch Ryan coastal path, and beyond. You can already walk parts of this, and the path along the coast from Drummore to Maryport is especially good.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Kirkmaiden Natural History Group"],["url=http:\/\/www.kirkmaidennature.org\/"],["email="],["address=Drummore"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +44 1776 840573"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=A Nature and Wildlife interest group, organising monthly meetings with guest speakers, and field trips.
