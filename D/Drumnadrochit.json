They arrange cruises on the loch with large operators or personally guided boat trips. One of the guides is an expert on Loch Ness if you want the non-tourist truth about the subject. Tours normally begin in Inverness, but the guides will collect from almost anywhere in the Highlands. Vehicles are luxury cars and mpvs with between three and eight passenger seats. These tours are exclusive so you buy the day, guide\/driver and vehicle for your entire party on an exclusive basis. Allow about £120 for a half day Loch Ness tour or up to £340 for an 11 hour tour which also takes in Skye and the Harry Potter viaduct etc. That is the price for up to six seats. They offer a sharing system so that you can offer spare seats to others to reduce costs and post your own requirments on their forum. There is also an early booking discount system in operation which can save up to 25%. Whether or not you book a tour with this company, the website describes their tours very well with a lot of photography which may give you other ideas."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Benleva hotel"]}," Make sure if you want dinner, go before 8pm, great local Scottish atmosphere."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Aslaich"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.aslaich.co.uk\/"],["email=stay@aslaich.co.uk"],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+44 1456 459466"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price=£24 – 30"],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=B&B, East Lewiston, Drumnadrochit."]]}," "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Drumnadrochit Hotel"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.drumnadrochithotel.activehotels.com"],["email="],["address=Loch Ness 2000 Exhibition Centre, IV63 6TU"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=Operates as a hotel in summer and as a B&B in winter. 30 rooms starting from £39."]]}," "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Drumnadrochit Lodges"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.drumnadrochit-lodges.com\/"],["email=info@drumnadrochit-lodges.com"],["address=Upper Achmony, Drumnadrochit by Loch Nes, Inverness-shire IV63 6UX"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+44 1456 450467 or +44 7879 273835"],["tollfree="],["fax=+44 1456 459049"],["price=from £250 per week per lodge"],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Elmbank"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.elmbank-lochness.co.uk"],["email=info@elmbank-lochness.co.uk"],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+44 1456 450372"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price= £20 – 25"],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=B&B, Lewiston, Drumnadrochit."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Ferness Cottage & Hillview"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.lochnessaccommodation.co.uk\/"],["email=info@lochnessaccommodation.co.uk"],["address=Lewiston, Drumnadrochit, Lochness, Inverness-Shire, IV63 6UW"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+44 1456 450564"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price=£44.00 to £56.00 per room per night"],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=B&B."]]}," "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Glen Rowan Bed & Breakfast"],["url=http:\/\/www.glenrowan.co.uk\/"],["email="],["address=Drumnadrochit, IV63 6UW"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=near Esso Garage"],["phone=+44 1456 450235"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=rates from £26"],["checkin=4pm"],["checkout=10am"],["content=Central heating in all areas, riverside garden, easy off-street parking, non-smoking, secure bike storage, laundry service, WiFi."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Greenlea"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.greenlea-drumnadrochit.co.uk\/"],["email="],["address=The Village Green, IV63 61X"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+44 1456 450546"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=B&B.
