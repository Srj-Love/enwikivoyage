Also, the drivers of Dubai Taxi Corporation go through their shift change between 4-6PM daily and it can be more difficult to find taxis during this time.  The standard of driving in Dubai ranges from poor to wild - taxis are some of the worst on the roads.  Taxi drivers are pretty good at knowing where the main shopping malls and hotels are, however less well known places will mean the driver calling his brother-in-law to get directions, whilst he drives around in circles on your time - hence it is a good idea to have a rough idea of where you are heading or what a nearby landmark is.\n\nTaxis are metered at 1.65 dhs\/km during the day and 1.75 dhs\/km at night, so no haggling is necessary.

Visitors taking advantage of this option will need to make certain that their driver knows his way around as many do not.\n\nWhen driving on the main roads, such as Sheikh Zayed road, the junction numbers are not in logical order. Junction 13 is just after Junction 18 and are rarely as shown on the maps. Road names can also be very confusing with slight differences in spelling (due to different transliterations from Arabic) being very important. The construction work that is taking place throughout and around Dubai can make finding your destination a challenge. Temporary road layouts change with alarming regularity and temporary signs can be misleading or non existent. As GPS maps are not up to date (and usually not anyway available to rent with hire cars), you will be very well off with a printed map (you can get an excellent one in Virgin stores, for example. There is a Virgin Megastore on the top floor of City Center).  \n    \nDriving during morning and afternoon peak hours is not recommended, as traffic slows to a standstill and even a simple trip across a bridge can take up to 45 minutes. There is also a scarcity of parking spaces in many parts of the city.   \n   \nWith such a mixture of nationalities residing in the city, driving styles are mixed to say the least.

Therefore, it is best to go through official channels when looking for work in Dubai as spot inspections are frequent and if found working illegally, both the employee and the employer will be subject to fines and even deportation.\n\nAll the necessary forms and documents are written and processed in Arabic and is best left to a professional or a \"P.R.O\" to handle your paperwork.\n\nThere are rules about changing jobs and its frequency. This rules are equally applicable for all nationalities. They have to complete their contract period, which is 2 years. If the employee breaks his\/her contract before the completion of 2 years, the new employer has to offer them salary above 5,000 AED in-order to avoid ban. Otherwise the employee has to wait until the completion of the left over months of his cancelled contract. If the employer breaks the contracts, then the employee can join another employer immediately irrespective of nationality, religion, cast or creed.\n\nWith the price of rentals ever soaring in Dubai and neighbouring Emirates, it is a good idea to discuss a housing allowance when negotiating a pay package.\n\nDespite all of this, there are a few upsides, Dubai companies are generous with holidays averaging almost 39 days a year of paid vacation (including public holidays), a round trip ticket home once a year (depending on your contract) and most importantly all your earnings are 100% tax free.\n\nRecruitment fraud is quite pervasive in this part of the world. Read your employment contract carefully before signing and do not pay any fees to recruitment agencies, as they are usually paid by the companies. Your passport is your personal property and cannot be withheld by the employer unless you are in a position of trust or are handling large sums of money.\n\nDubai has been accused by numerous organizations of effectively enslaving workers from Southeast Asia by allowing companies to take their passports without returning them and allowing salaries to go unpaid.  Foreign workers, Western and otherwise, have no rights that will be upheld by the courts, and so they have no recourse should they feel their rights violated.  Potential workers should be aware of this when considering work in Dubai.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["SeeDistricts"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Dubai Gold Souk on 31 May 2007 Pict 2.jpg"],["250px"],["thumb"],["All that glitters ",{"type":"''","value":["is"]}," gold at the Gold Souk."]]},"\n\nDubai is practically synonymous with shopping and could be called \"Do buy\". Low tariffs and a huge amount of cargo passing through its port ensure that practically anything is available at fairly competitive rates, although the appreciation of the Dirham and the plentiful supply of shoppers means that Dubai is no longer a bargain basement shopping city. You'll also find products in Western chain stores, still with the original tags quoting euro or sterling prices, being sold with a 20-30% mark-up once converted to dirhams. The best things to buy are textiles, electronics and gold; electronics are believed to be much cheaper, while there is a wide selection of textiles and gold.\n\nDubai shops suffer from the standard developing world shopping phenomenon of having no storeroom and no stocks in reserve, even in the mega-malls – and for clothes shopping this may mean that you struggle to find the style you want in the size you want.  Shops open as early as 9AM and stay open to 10PM, and on weekends to midnight or 1AM.\n\nRemember to haggle in the souks, as discounts are almost always available and even in situations where the item will not become much cheaper, the customer is always expected to \"play the game\" of haggling. A simple question of \"what's your best price?\" will often result in a shop-keeper going to extraordinary lengths to sell his stock. Prices in the malls and other Western shops tend not to be negotiable. Far from being a bad thing, this allows the canny visitor to work out comparative prices for common souvenirs – an invaluable aid when a shop-keeper in a souk is asking for a higher price.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/mydsf.ae\/en\/depe\/dubaiShoppingFestival.aspx Dubai Shopping Festival"]}]}," has been the biggest shopping event in the Middle East since 1996.

It is the Arabic equivalent of the burger. It is meat that has been cooked on a skewer and then cut into thin strips and placed into a kuhbus (",{"type":"''","value":["pita"]},") bread with vegetables and dressing. It costs about 5 AED for either the plain-jane variety or the more exotic Lebanese and Iranian varieties. The shawarma sold by Indian restaurants are arguably the cheapest.\n\nAnother local snack is ",{"type":"'''","value":["fala-fil"]}," (felafel, falafel), which is as cheap as shawarma.\n\nMost of the American fast food chains have set up shop, including KFC, Chillis, TGI Fridays, Starbucks, and McDonalds. The beauty of the food in Dubai is that you will probably find cuisine for every taste. All food is halal.\n\nDubai has a big selection of budget Indian food. Dosa, vada, idlee, samosa, chapaati\/roti, with generous servings of sabji (cooked vegetable stew) are available at throwaway prices, typically less than 10 dhs (US$2.50) per course. The more expensive stuff costs up to USD 5. Bur Dubai (particularly Meena Bazaar area) and Karama are the places that abound in these restaurants. Most of them are open from 7AM till 10PM or 11PM throughout the week.\n\nPork is eaten here mostly by non-Muslim Filipinos and Europeans.

Quality tends to be high, along with price, but non-guests are able to reserve tables as well, thus allowing the rest of us to experience a bit of these hotels. Floating restaurants for dinner cum sight seeing in Dubai Marina are also popular among both non-travelers and travelers. Few agencies like Trilogy-Yachts & ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cruisemarina.com\/ Cruise Marina"]}," currently have licensed floating restaurants and hence charge high for the quality of food and service.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["SeeDistricts"]]},"\nDubai has supercharged the nightlife in the last decade and most international known brands have a ",{"type":"''","value":["sister"]}," location in town. Most 3-5 star hotels have bars and nightclubs for those interested in the nightlife. World-class DJs frequent Dubai's nightclubs, and many A-list musical celebrities are adding Dubai to their list of tour dates. There is nothing missing and during the high tides of the party time, the impression of being in Ibiza is not misleading. Most of the night life is geared at the beaches of Jumeirah or the Dubai Marina. Bur Dubai is more family-oriented (e.g. Dubai Fountain), while Deira was able in parts to maintain its more Arabic focussed style. Dubai is very popular with Arabic travellers, so an Arabic blend is added quite often\n\nDubai has several laws regarding alcohol which travelers should be aware of:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Alcohol is available only at licensed premises, usually attached to hotels (most nightclubs and bars are in or attached to hotels, though they may have separate entrances)."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Alcohol is not sold on religious holidays, nor during daylight hours in Ramadan (even to non-Muslims)."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["It is illegal to drink alcohol in public places"]},", and there is a zero-tolerance policy on drunk driving.

Due to substantial increase in hotel rooms and the financial crises, only during Islamic holidays do prices rise substantially. The cheapest places, mainly catering to small-scale businessmen, can be found in near the souks of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dubai\/Deira"],["Deira"]]},".\n\nSee the individual listings in the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Dubai#Orientation"],["districts"]]}]}," for hotel recommendations. In general tourists tend to stay at the beach hotels in Jumeirah or Jebel Ali, while city dwellers have ample choice in Deira or Bur Dubai. Keep in mind that Dubai is a stretch along the coastline and that taxis are cheap and the metro reliable, so there are always alternative options. The only hassles are ever-new construction sites and the rush hour. During the summer heat a hotel with access to a mall or shopping complex is beneficial to have a greater area for air conditioned walking.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nDubai is a fast growing city that has its share of problems but nothing that using common sense can't avoid.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Traffic"]},"\n\nDriving and pedestrian safety has also been an issue given the different nationalities that share the road. Do not jaywalk or cross where there are no clear pedestrian markings. Speeding is common here, and the odds of you being knocked over are quite high unless you follow the rules. Avoid driving on the extreme left lane of highways to avoid being \"flashed\" and being forced to move a lane over. Road rage is also starting to become an issue given the increase in traffic jams and poor driving courtesy.\n\nRude hand gestures (the \"finger\" etc.) and profanity can lead to fines and jail times if reported, so keep your cool if you are cut off or are behind an erratic driver. In general, you will find those gestures and actions that some may find only slightly offensive in your home country—or perhaps not offensive at all—can at times be extremely offensive to the Dubai locals. Therefore, use a degree of common sense of what is right and wrong to help you stay out of trouble.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Islamic laws"]},"\n\nThe United Arab Emirates might seem to have more relaxed laws than their other Arab counterparts, but the laws are still very different from most Western countries, and their laws are strictly enforced. A simple kiss in a public place, having an alcoholic drink in the wrong place or even losing your temper could land you a month or more in jail. Please exercise caution and common sense when visiting and make sure you are aware of all their laws or expect severe consequences that could seriously ruin your vacation.\n\nDubai strictly follows Islamic laws which should be respected by all travellers. Islam is the official religion, therefore do not publicly criticise or distribute material against it. Eating in public during the holy month of Ramadan is prohibited from sunrise until sunset and visitors should consume meals in the confines of their hotel or residence.\n\nIn conversations about politics and world affairs, avoid criticising the ruling family of any of the seven Emirates or prominent business families. The United Arab Emirates does not have any formal relations with Israel, and the government publicly supports causes that involves the Palestinian people or Palestinian statehood.\n\nPublic display of affection are frowned upon and public sexual acts can lead to jail time followed by deportation. In 2008, a British couple were arrested and faced jail sentences because they had sexual contact on a beach in Dubai. If all tourists remain respectful, decent and ensure that they do not upset the local people, there should be no problems.\n\nHomosexuality, along with ",{"type":"''","value":["all"]}," sexual relations outside of marriage, is a criminal offense with possible deportation or months of jail. Public displays of affection or cross-dressing may lead to jail time and\/or deportation. They should be avoided completely in public to ensure that no problems arise. In 2013 a Norwegian woman reported she had been raped but then, following bad advice, rescinded it. She was then sentenced to sixteen months in jail for extramarital sex and filing a false police report. After public pressure she was pardoned and deported.\n\nWomen should dress sensibly and avoid wearing revealing outfits. This is especially true when traveling to districts like Karama, Deira and Bur Dubai, where the streets are packed with men, especially on evenings and weekends. While swimsuits and bikinis are a common sight on Dubai beaches, avoid sunbathing topless or wearing microbikinis—even in the private beach of a hotel.\n\nProstitution is illegal in Dubai but still it is visible at nightclubs, bars and other places. Law enforcement ignores partially the solicitation but penalties are high if something is to obvious or others call the police. The biggest problem is that many prostitutes don't have a legit residence permit so human trafficing and forced prostitution is an issue to keep in mind.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Petty crime"]},"\n\nWhile petty crime is hardly reported or mentioned in the news, keep an eye on your wallet or purse when in crowded areas like Naser Square or Deira in general. If withdrawing large amounts of cash from ATMs or banking institutions, either conceal the notes or ask the institution's security to escort you to your vehicle. Cases have occurred where people have been robbed of large amounts of cash when in crowded places just because they were not careful.\n\nConmen are ever present in Dubai, especially the \"Nigeria 419\" scammers. Do not arrange meetings or entertain their requests or give any personal details. Should they not comply, individuals who will be happy to listen to their business propositions are the police.\n\nThanks to Dubai's new property boom and bust, real estate fraudsters are also popping up, so exercise extreme caution if you are interested in buying or renting.\n\nDrug use and distribution are serious criminal offences, even when in the company of the person consuming the material, and can lead to a prison sentence of several years or even to be in front of the firing squad. Passenger baggage is screened quite thoroughly when entering Dubai. Even prescription drugs ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.fairtrials.net\/index.php\/news\/article\/list_of_controlled_pharmaceutical_substances_in_uae\/"]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.moh.gov.ae\/admincp\/assetsmanager\/files\/pharmacusts\/updated%20controlled%20medical%20list%20seperated%202007.pdf"]}," (without original prescription note) or ones that you bought over the counter in your country can lead to a prison sentence.\n\nYou need to be careful when you are a tourist in Dubai, like many places around the world, people have a keen eye for tourists and can cheat you.
