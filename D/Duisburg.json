It is an independent metropolitan borough within Regierungsbezirk Düsseldorf. With the world's biggest inland harbor and its proximity to Düsseldorf International Airport, Duisburg has become an important venue for commerce and steel production.\n\nToday's city is a result of numerous incorporations of surrounding towns and smaller cities. It is the twelfth-largest city in Germany and the fifth-largest city in North Rhine-Westphalia with 489,599 residents as of 31 December 2010. The city is renowned for its steel industry. There is still one coal mine in operation, but Duisburg has never been a coal-mining center to the same extent as other places in the Ruhr. All blast furnaces in the Ruhr are now located in Duisburg. 49% of all hot metal and 34.4% of all pig-iron in Germany is produced here (as of 2000). The University of Duisburg-Essen, with 33,000 students, ranks among the 10 largest German universities.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Düsseldorf International Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["DUS"]]},") ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.dus-int.de\/dus_en\/"]}," 20 km south of Duisburg is home of several airlines.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Niederrhein airport"]},", also known as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Airport Weeze"]},", is a short distance from the city.
