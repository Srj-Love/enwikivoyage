Dumbarton is in West Dunbartonshire Council Area.\n\nThe town does has some attractions, notably the castle, which is on a districtive hill like Edinburgh and Stirling castles, but has also attracted some unfavourable reviews: \"Dumbarton is a brutal concrete sprawl, fulfilling every last hellish cliche about post-war planning and architecture\" - so says the 1994 edition of ",{"type":"''","value":["The Rough Guide to Scotland"]},".\n\nThe Denny Tank Museum is also worth a visit, but there is not a great deal to be seen in the modern town centre. The town could be comfortably explored as a day trip from Glasgow.\n\nThe population is just over 20,000. You may have seen the town on BBC television in Scotland as the set for the Soap ",{"type":"''","value":["River City"]},", a northern version of ",{"type":"''","value":["Eastenders"]},". Whisky blending and bonded storage is a major industry in the town.
