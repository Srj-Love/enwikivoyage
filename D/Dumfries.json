A more traditional administrative status is principal town of Dumfriesshire, but this changed in 1974. Further back, it was two towns, Dumfries and Maxwelltown; this changed in 1929 for administrative purposes, although the name is still sometimes used to describe the area west of the River Nith. Maxwelltown was not part of Dumfriesshire, so the two towns were then quite separate. In 1997, the town was deemed \"best place to live in Britain\", an accolade still sometimes used in describing the town.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Devorguilla Bridge, Dumfries - geograph.org.uk - 1322035.jpg‎"],["right"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Devorguilla Bridge, Dumfries"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By road"]},"\n\nDumfries is linked by the A75, A701 and A709 to the M74 north-south route, the A76 to the Nith Valley and the continuing A75 to the west of the region.

Traffic and parking are sometimes problems in the town, although not any more than in many others. Parking discs are required in most parking on and off-street, with the exceptions of parts of the Brooms Road, Whitesands, Newall Terrace car parks and the whole of that on Burns Street.

Other attractions include the (free, but seasonal) Bridge House Museum and the Camera Obscura museum, which features various historical artefacts as well as the chance to view the surrounding area using that instrument. There is also the Ice Bowl, which includes a skating rink and bowling facilties, and, after some delay, the swimming pool and sports\/exhibition hall \"DG One\"",{"type":"[","value":["www.dgone.co.uk"]},". As well as well and dry exercise opportunities, it has also hosted both Roy Chubby Brown and the Scottish Ballet in its short history. There are also two cinemas, both single screen: the Odeon, near DG one, which is often insulted by locals but is probably no worse than anywhere else, and the council run Robert Burns Film Theatre, which recently begin to describe itself as an “art house” and plays a mix of films, including some independent ones and major but slightly post-release ones. There is also the Ottersburn Gallery, near the old swimming pool and the Gracefield Arts Centre, on the Edinburgh Road.\n\nDumfries is also home to the oldest working theatre in Scotland. Situated on Shakespeare Street, a short walk from the Odeon cinema, the Theatre Royal hosts a variety of shows throughout the year, featuring both travelling companies and the Dumfries' own Guild of Players.\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Mabie Farm Park"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.mabiefarmpark.co.uk\/"],["email="],["address=Burnside Farm, Mabie, Dumfries DG2 8EZ"],["lat=55.02773"],["long=-3.64008"],["directions=From Dumfries follow the “Solway Coast” road (A710), taking you towards New Abbey"],["phone=01387 259666"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=A good kids entertainment place with rides, slides and animals."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nDumfries has gained a reputation for lacking shops, with many empty windows at different times, and at one time many of the shops that did open were at the lower end of the market, such as one-pound and charity shops. This is often attributed to Carlisle, Glasgow, Edinburgh and the Metro Centure providing alternatives for shopping trips, as well as the wider issue of Tesco's prominence. Dumfries was also second to Exeter among those most criticised in a New Economics Foundation report on \"clone towns\", with the shops that do exist often being the same as everywhere else. However, this picture is not really accurate, with the Loreburne Shopping Centre now having very few empty units and numerous independent shops just off High Street on English Street, Queensbury Street, and to a lesser extent Friar's Vennel, which has some independent and bargain shops, but also some covered with quaint illustrations on boards to avoid seeming derelict. The street was recently resurfaced as a way of combating its dingy reputation. Also notable is Barbour's department store on Buccleuch Street. Electrical and DIY stores have gravitated towards two retail parks, located on the A76, one of which also includes the large Tesco Extra store; there is also a third on the A709 containing cheaper shops such as Matalan, and this is also the site of the third Tesco for the town.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nThis list is not exhaustive, and as elsewhere restaurants can close and open from time to time, but some of the most notable ones in the town include : -\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Casa Mia"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.casamiadumfries.co.uk\/"],["email="],["address=53 Nunholm Road"],["lat=55.08119"],["long=-3.61167"],["directions="],["phone=+44 1387 269619"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=12.00 - 14:00 & 17:00 until late"],["price="],["content=Modern European Cuisine"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Jewel in the Crown"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address=48-50 St Michael St,"],["lat=55.06377"],["long=-3.60489"],["directions="],["phone=+44 1387 264183"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Indian Cuisine"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Hullabaloo"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.hullabaloorestaurant.co.uk\/index.php\/home\/"],["email="],["address=Mill Road, Dumfries"],["lat=55.06655"],["long=-3.61400"],["directions="],["phone=+44 1387 259679"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Hullabaloo is situated alongside the Nith River to the west in the Robert Burns Centre."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Drummuir Farm Ice Cream"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.drummuirfarm.co.uk\/"],["email=enquiries@drummuirfarm.co.uk"],["address=Drummuir Farm, Clarencefield Road, Collin"],["lat=55.05441"],["long=-3.49945"],["directions=Off B724 to the west of Dumfries"],["phone=+44 1387 750 599"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Established in 1991 it serves a range of home-made ice creams, hand-made in with milk from their own herd of dairy cows.",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"Not only for the kids!"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Lucky Star"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address=43-45 English Street, DG1 2BU"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+44 1387 253655"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Chinese"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Pizzeria Il Fiume"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.pizza-pasta.co.uk\/"],["email="],["address=Dock Park, DG1 2RY"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+44 1387 265 154"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=3 courses £12 5pm - 6.30pm; Mains £10-20"],["content=Italian"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nDumfries has a reputation for having many pubs of various sorts, partly due to its status as a hub for the surrounding region. The most prominent is the Robert the Bruce, part of the Wetherspoons chain, located at the north end of High Street, and named after the king who slew his opponent The Red Comyn at a now destroyed church nearby. Like Tesco, its arrival concerned independent rivals, and there have been a limited number of closures since then, including Mulligan's and Souter Johnny's. Others in the centre include Baker Street, the White Hart (pub\/club\/venue), The Yard (late night pub with music), Dink's (music bar), Ma-Donnas (lively bar\/bristo), Slipstream, The New Bazzar, The Globe, The Hole i' the Wall, The Stag, Dickie's and the Flesher's Arms. As well as those mentioned above, Dumfries has three venues clearly in the nightclub category:\n\n- Jumpin' Jak's, part of a national chain. This has one large room and a wide selection of music. Generally friendly and good atmosphere with crowd members welcomed to dance on stage. This replaced the slightly seedy Junction with a gap between closing and opening in 2002.\n\n- The Venue. Founded as The Loft then closed and re-invented after a drug-related closure, this was at one time the definitive nightspot in Dumfries for young people (often suspiciously young) but has come under pressure from Jak's, and moved into live events to maintain a distinct image. On weekend nights, it still provides strong competition for its corporate neighbour, with two rooms, one with dance music and the other covering pop, rock, hip-hop and anything else.\n\n- Chancers. This is the longest-established of the three, and aims for an older crowd. Split into two rooms and open all nights of the week.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nSome of Dumfries's longer-established hotels are no more, including the County, now Waterstone’s bookshop. The smartest and biggest hotel is the Cairndale, although it only gets a 3-star rating. B+Bs and rooms above some pubs are common around the town, as well as some hotels including the Huntingdon House and Birkhill on the A709 slighly out of the centre. On the edge of town there are two motels, Travel Inn and Travel Lodge, both close by near the split between bypass and non-bypass traffic on the east of town.
