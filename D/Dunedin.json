It is a small city with a compact walkable city centre surrounded by hilly suburbs. It has easy access to beaches, wildlife attractions and areas of native forest.\n\nKnown as the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Edinburgh"]]}," of the South, it has a proud ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Scotland"],["Scots"]]}," heritage. It has as its heart a statue of the poet Robbie Burns and many of its streets carry the same name as streets in Edinburgh. Due to the gold rush in central Otago, Dunedin was the biggest and most prosperous city in New Zealand from 1865 to 1900, and many of its old buildings and character stem from that period.\n\nDunedin sits in a natural harbour, with the centre of the city on a relatively small area of flat land surrounded by suburbs on the steep hillsides. Some of its streets are very steep: Baldwin Street is claimed as being the steepest street in the world, a claim which is celebrated during the annual ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/chocolatecarnival.co.nz\/jaffa_race chocolate festival"]}," by rolling more than 40,000 Jaffas down it. (Jaffas are small, round sweets consisting of a soft chocolate centre with a hard covering of orange flavoured, red coloured confectionery and made at the local Cadbury factory and also exported to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Australia"]]},").\n\nIt does get cold: many of the streets are iced over in winter, and every two or three years the city gets a snowfall.\n\nThese days, Dunedin is most well known for its University of Otago, the oldest and one of the best universities in New Zealand, and its 'scarfie' student culture. The university is the South Island's second largest employer and by far the biggest contributor to the Dunedin economy. Dunedin is a university town rather than just a town with a university since the student population of around 27,000 is nearly 23% of the 120,000 residents. A consequence of this is that the city is significantly quieter during the university summer holiday period (approx November to February), and that accommodation may be harder to find or more expensive during university graduations, etc.\n\nDunedinites (the Dunedin people) are generally friendly, seemingly more friendly than in the bigger cities of NZ (and the bigger cities anywhere else in the world).\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Visitor Information"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=i-SITE Dunedin Visitor Centre"],["url=http:\/\/www.dunedin.govt.nz\/isite\/about-the-visitor-centre"],["email=visitor.centre@dcc.govt.nz"],["address=26 Princess St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+64 3 474-3300"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Daily 08:45-17:00"],["price="],["content=Open 365 days a year, it provides extensive local and national information as well as a booking service for visitors and residents."]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Dunedin's principal airport is ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.dnairport.co.nz\/ ",{"type":"'''","value":["Dunedin International Airport"]}]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["DUD"]]},") about 30 km (19 mi) out of town and served by domestic and international flights."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.airnewzealand.co.nz\/ ",{"type":"'''","value":["Air New Zealand"]}]},", ☎ 0800 737 000, flies domestically to\/from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Auckland"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wellington"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Christchurch"]]}," and internationally to\/from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brisbane"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sydney"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Melbourne"]]},".
