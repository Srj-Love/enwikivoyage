Head north past Dumbarton on the A82 to Tarbet, then take the A83 over Rest and Be Thankful to the A815 turnoff where you turn off. After passing Strachur and Lock Eck you'll reach Sandbank and thence Dunoon after about two hours.\n\nA ferry crossing adds expense but drastically reduces the distance you'll travel. Take the M8 and then A8 out of Glasgow until you reach Greenock, where you then take the A770 through Gourock to McInroy's Point. Western Ferries make frequent crossings (every 20 minutes on weekdays)between McInroy's Point and Hunter's Quay, just north of Dunoon at the mouth of Holy Loch.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nFirst Scotrail ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.firstscotrail.co.uk"]}," services travel frequently between Gourock and Glasgow Central, making local stops at stations such as Paisley, Port Glasgow, and Greenock. Train connections are available to much of Scotland and England from Glasgow Central, including Edinburgh, London Euston and the rest of the West Coast Main Line, and much of the Strathclyde innner-regional system. At Gourock it's a short walk over to the Caledonian MacBrayne terminal for the Argyll Ferries passenger service to Dunoon Pier. This ferry runs every half-hour on weekdays, except between 12 and 3pm when it is hourly. It is usually scheduled to connect with trains.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["By bus"]},"\nScottish CityLink ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.citylink.co.uk\/"]}," runs bus services from Glasgow's Buchanan Street Bus Station roughly every hour through the day till evening to both ferry terminals. The bus ride takes just over an hour. Notify the driver of which ferry terminal you wish to be dropped off at. McGills buses also run a direct bus service, the Cowal Connector, from Glasgow to Dunoon, which stays on the Western Ferries ferry. It runs every few hours or so, check the timetable for details.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nWest Coast Motors ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.westcoastmotors.com\/"]}," provides service throughout the area highly dependant on where you want to go.

There is also a service to Portavadie where there is a Cal-Mac ferry service to Tarbert. There are also bus services to the Isle of Bute, which stay on the Colintraive - Rhubodach ferry for 5 minutes of the journey. Expensive and irregular, it can be a pleasure if you have a friendly bus driver. There are plenty of overpriced taxis vying for your trade in Dunoon and numbers are always available.\n\nA best bet for a visit is to take a car, as this is necescary to get to the best walking spots and off the beaten track.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Benmore.jpg"],["thumb"],["Benmore Botanic Gardens"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Benmore Botanic Gardens"],["url=http:\/\/www.rbge.org.uk\/the-gardens\/benmore"],["email=benmore@rbge.org.uk"],["address=Dunoon, Argyll"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone =+44  1369 706261"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Open daily 1 March to 31 October from 10AM"],["price=Adults £4.00, Children £1.00, Families £9.00"],["content= Site of one of the finest collections of conifers as well as rhododendrons in the world, Benmore Botanic Gardens, managed by the Royal Botanic Gardens in Edinburgh, offers a 130 acre estate filled with trees and plants from around the world.
