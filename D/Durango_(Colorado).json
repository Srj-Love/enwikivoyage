Durango is situated a short drive from the “Four Corners”, where New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Colorado meet. The surrounding landscape of Durango is diverse, spanning from red sandstone bluffs of the Animas River Valley to jagged peaks of the San Juan Mountains, a few of which rise to elevations over 14,000 feet.

The city was founded in 1880 by the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad. By July of 1882, tracks to Silverton were completed and the train began transporting both freight and passengers. The laborers were paid an average of $2.25\/day. The Durango-Silverton Railroad was originally constructed to haul silver and gold ore, but passengers soon started to really appreciate the view. In 2006, the Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad celebrated its 125th year of continuous operation and continues to be a favorite attraction on a Colorado sightseeing vacation.\nMany of the buildings in historic downtown Durango were constructed with stone and brick due to a city ordinance enacted after a fire in 1889, which damaged several blocks along Main Avenue.\nThe Diamond Belle Saloon at the Strater Hotel opened its doors in 1957 and has a bullet hole in the far east drawer behind the bar.\nIn the recent past, there have been several well known movies made in Durango, including Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, City Slickers, Cliffhanger, National Lampoon’s Vacation, Night Passage, Ticket to Tomahawk, Around the World in Eighty Days, How the West Was Won, and Tracker.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.flydurango.com\/ Durango\/La Plata County Airport"]}]},", to the southeast of town on US-160 and SR-172, has commuter air service from Denver and Phoenix.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nThe town is well connected by highways from all major compass points, but some care should be taken if driving here from the east via US Highway 160.
