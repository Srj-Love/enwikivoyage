There is also the Bunny Chow which is unique to the city, a quarter loaf of bread hollowed out and filled with a curry of your choice.  Check out the Workshop restaurants for some of the best bunny chow in the city.  Or head over to the Indian neighborhood near Victoria Market for more authentic Durban Indian food.\n\nGood Indian dining is at Vintage Restaurant next to Bean Bag Bohemia - Windemere Road\n\nTry the Roma Revolving Restaurant at the top of John Ross House on the Esplanade for Italian food and the best view of Durban.\n\nWilson's Wharf a long pier build into the harbour, hosts a wide selection of international restaurants and watch the busiest harbor in Africa's activity. Take in a show afterwards at the upstairs Catalina theater.\n\nTry Morningside restaurants, along Florida Road, for trendy cafe sidewalk eateries including one Italian style, Spiga d'Oro, frequented so often by South Africa's notorious businessman, Schabir Shaik, that a dish is named in his honor 'Pasta a la Shaik'. Bill Clinton and Bill Gates ate at \"Spice\" set off the busy street in a quiet upstairs courtyard. And nearby, be nearly guaranteed to rub shoulders with the up-and-coming in-crowd at the Bean Bag Bohemia, Windermere Road, a restaurant that makes great dining an artistic event.\n\nDefinitely try some 'biltong' when you're in South Africa. Its South African-style jerky and available in a whole range of flavors and textures.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nZacks, located at Wilson's wharf on Victoria's embankment is a popular place to get thirst quenching drinks and just relax and enjoy the view of the harbor. \nJoe Kool's, on the beachfront is also well known as the best place for a \"sundowner\" after a long day on the beach.  Check out their roof-top deck for the best views.\nThe BAT Centre, on the port is also a good place for a quick meal or drink.  There's free jazz most nights as well as other concerts, hip-hop and the occasional poetry slam.\nThe Firkin is a micro-brewery on the top floor of the Pavilion shopping centre in Westville. It has some great ales and beers and good snacks at reasonable prices.Tilted house is a trendy place situated in the city center in an old Victorian house. It has its own VIP section, but it is open to the beautiful as well as important. Cool Runnings is a reggeaton place with cheap beer and a relaxed atmosphere. Burn is a good concert scene for Metal and Rock music with club evenings every weekend. Durban is known for it`s pot and you will easily find it around the clubs, but beware that the police does care if tourists break the law and you can be thrown out of the country if you are caught with it.\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["drink"],["name=Florida Road 275"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+27 (0)31 312-3355"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Definitely the happening street in Durban.

Avoid the usually busy central business district, which is empty after dark. Above all, use common sense.\n\nRemember, you're a tourist, not a celebrity. Dress down to blend in with the people in the CBD (keep the fancy stuff to a minimum).\n\nThe harbour area is quite safe, as are the shopping malls and higher residential areas.\n\nThe Point, the area between downtown and the port, is known for prostitution and cheap hotels has higher crime rate (although parts are currently undergoing a massive redevelopment).
