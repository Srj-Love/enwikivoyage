There are several airlines that fly from Moscow (Tajik Air, Somon Air, Domodedovo Airlines and Sibirian S7) to Dushanbe. S7 or it's share code flies to most European countries and you could check in your luggage up to Dushanbe. Otherwise you will require a transit visa to collect your luggage and check it in again. If you have no checked luggage, you could walk straight to transit area. There is also twice a week a flight from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Istanbul"]]}," - Atat√ºrk on Turkish Airlines. TA also flies to most of the major cities in Europe and your luggage will be checked up to Dushanbe. If you use a different airline and have checked in luggage you need a transit visa because the airlines will not transfer it for you. For that reason you have to collect the luggage yourself and check it in for your final flight. In order to collect it you have to pass passport control for which you need a visa (many countries get it upon arrival and free, Google yours). These policies are subject to change without a notice. Check with your airline(s) to find out whether they currently transfer luggage.\n\nChina Southern Airlines also flies into Dushanbe from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Urumqi"]]},".\n\nSomon Air have a weekly direct flight to Frankfurt, as well as flights to Dubai, Istanbul and Kiev, from which connections can be made to Europe and elsewhere.\n\nMost of the European and North American nationals can apply for a visa upon arrival in Dushanbe. The airport is very small and the immigration is just right before the passport control. Make sure to bring 2 passport photos, and know the person's address in which you are staying. Don't lose your \"beeline travel slip\" which you will get at the immigration office. the luggage x-ray machines are very poor and they pay little attention to the screens. Watch the kids when you leave the airport they will offer to take your bag to the car and start to pull it off you. though not with intentions of stealing, just wanting to help and gain a tip.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nRail services to Dushanbe are limited.

Tickets costs from 9000 RUB for a second class sleeper.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus\/ Taxi"]},"\n\nThere are no international bus services. A number of bus services operate in Dushanbe, however there is not much clarity which one goes to where. Within Dushanbe it is best to take a taxi, usually it should not be more than 30 Somoni ($6). If you are planning to go to a different town in Dushanbe there are 'terminals' that you can either find a shared taxi or a minibus.\n\nKhorog (Pamir) - the terminal is close to the airport, ask for 'povorot aeroporta terminal Pamira'. There are usually 4X4 vehicles that will go to Pamirs. The roads are not in a good shape, hence make sure you look for a nicer vehicle for a 10 to 14 hours drive to reach Khorog. Prices vary depending on a season.\n\nKhojent (and the rest of Sugd) - the terminal is at the end of Rudaki Street towards Varzob Valley. Ask your taxi driver to drop you to the Stoyanka Khodjenta close to Vodonasos or Cemzavod. It is the end of the Trolleybus line.\n\nKurgan-Tybe and Kulyab - there are many private cars that will go to there, however mainly it is from Korvon Market.\n\nDushanbe - Afghan Border (Sherkhon Bandar) - private SUVs go to the border on daily bases from Sakhovat Market. You will have to go early in the morning 05:00 to check for a shared car. Best is to go there a day before and arrange for the next day travel.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nVery few streets in Dushanbe are known by their names, so it is important to know landmarks and how to navigate with them. Every cab driver knows the airport, Somoni statue, and opera-ballet, but beyond that, it is a toss-up. It is essential to know \"straight ahead,\" \"to the left,\" and \"to the right\" in Russian or Tajik. It is very useful to figure out the marshrukta system (private cars and minibuses), which run on a standard set of routes, which, incidentally, cannot be found on paper or online. #3 is especially useful as it runs all the way up and down Rudaki. Minibuses are overcrowded, stop more frequently, and cost 1 somoni, while private cars are much quicker and cost 3 somoni. For marshrukti, the only important phrase is \"hamin jo\" (ha-MEEN JOH), which means \"right here,\" to indicate that you want to get out.\n\nDushanbe is an interesting city, but only for a few days. The center is basically one long street, with a few other main streets crossing it. Other than a few musea and monuments, there is not much here. The nightlife is not of a western standard. There are three main clubs: Port Said, Dior, and Vastan (all on or near Rudaki Street). The clubs are pretty bad and attract bad music, prostitutes, and are mostly filled with men. If a man goes out with a Tajik women, he will be expected to pay for her. The streets are lined with old and tall planetrees, so in the evenings a stroll along Rudaki is quite pleasant. Rudaki Park also features numerous fountains lit by coloured lights, and the Botanical Gardens (behind the Chinese Embassy, somewhat north along Rudaki) is the best place to escape the dust and noise of the traffic for peace and quiet.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Massive Statue of Somoni"],["content=This statue commemorates the one for whom the currency is named.
