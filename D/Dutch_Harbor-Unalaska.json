It was built in 1825 and then enlarged in 1894, when its floor plan was changed from to a pekov (the shape of a crucifix). On Broadway overlooking the bay, the church and its onion domes are a photographer's delight. The church contains almost 700 pieces of art, ranging from Russian Orthodox icons and books to the largest collection of 19th-century paintings in Alaska. The best time to view the church and its icons is at 18:00 on Saturday when staff members give an informal 30-minute tour just before service. Outside the church is a small graveyard, where the largest grave marker belongs to Baron Nicholas Zass. Born in 1825 in Archangel, Russia, he eventually became bishop of the Aleutian Islands and all of Alaska, before his death in 1882. Next door to the graveyard is the Bishop's House."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Amelia's Restaurant"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat=53.886485"],["long=-166.54679"],["directions="],["phone=+1 907 581-2800"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=American cuisine."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Peking Restaurant"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address=100 Gilman Rd"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +1 907 581-2303"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Chinese food."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Grand Aleutian Hotel"],["alt=Harbor View Inn"],["url=http:\/\/www.grandaleutian.com"],["email=reservations@unisea.com"],["address=498 Salmon Way"],["lat=53.88423"],["long=-166.55082"],["directions="],["phone = +1 907 581-3844"],["tollfree=+1-866-581-3844"],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Aleutian Islands"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Unalaska, Alaska"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["53.883"],["-166.516"]]}]
