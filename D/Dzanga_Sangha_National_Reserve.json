Vehicles can be hired with drivers from one of several operators in Bangui. A stopover at N'gotto, a national park project with very comfortable accommodation at Encampment Le Buffel Rouge, is recommended. The trip can be done in one very long day's driving and with an early departure from Bangui in good conditions you can easily arrive before dark. It is also possible to charter a small aircraft from Bangui to Bayanga, approximately 1 hours flight and cost dependent on the aircraft size are from $3500 upwards. Aircraft charters must be arranged well prior to your expected dates of departure.
