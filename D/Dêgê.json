The city is famous for its Tibetan lamasery which hosts an invaluable treasure of wooden printing blocks with Tibetan Buddhist texts. Historically, it belongs to the ancient Tibetan province of Kham and lies at an elevation of 3100 meters, (10,170 ft). Sharing its destiny with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kangding"]]},", Dégé's location in a narrow valley and the resulting lack of space has led to a total demolition of the town's original center and its rebuilding with high, distasteful tiled generic Han Chinese-style architecture. Nevertheless the surrounding quarters on the valley's slopes still preserve the old Tibetan traditions including the temple complex that contains a maze of wonderful old style wooden Tibetan buildings just up the road from the temple complex. Dege lies as the last town on the provincial border of Sichuan across from the T.A.R.

The Printing House is in a beautiful traditional temple which was restored in 1991.  It is constantly circambulated by townspeople and pilgrims. Admission fee is ¥50\/person, and normally photography of the sections with the printing blocks is not allowed, though you can take pictures of the printing process. It is always worth asking your guide if it's allowed to take a particular photograph as the rules change from time to time. The institution was founded in 1729 by Chogyal (dharma king) Denba Tsering. There are more than 140,000 printing blocks, a large collection of national cultural relics and a library comprising 830 books consisting of 10000 volumes. The last surviving copy of an old history of Indian Buddhism is amongst them. As the pamphlet you are handed puts it: ",{"type":"<","value":["cite",["\"This bright cultural pearl is the crystallization of the wisdom of the Tibetan people living in snow realm.\""]]},". Inside you can wander the corridor lined with shelves accommodating the printing blocks, their handles protruding. on the 3rd floor there is the workshop. 6 or 7 pairs of workers ink the blocks and press the paper on them with amazing speed.
