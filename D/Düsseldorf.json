In fact, many people refer to the Altstadt as the \"longest bar in the world\" (\"Längste Theke der Welt\"). The most common drink is \"Altbier\" or simply \"Alt.\" This dark beer, served in small glasses, is available at practically any restaurant in the city. Altbier is only brewed in breweries around Düsseldorf. Some of the traditional breweries are the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.uerige.de \"Uerige\""]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.fuechschen.de \"Füchschen\""]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.hausbrauerei-zum-schluessel.de \"Zum Schlüssel\""]}," and ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.schumacher-alt.de \"Schumacher\""]},".\n\nIn the Altstadt you can enjoy Schlüssel, Uerige, Schumacher, and Füchschen beers, at traditional brewery restaurants. The waiters at these traditional restaurants are called \"Köbes.\" These waiters will replace empty glasses with full ones when they see one.  Typically new visitors to the city are surprised by a new fresh glass of Altbier in front of them when they did not order one.  To signal that you are done and do not want any more Altbier, simply place your coaster (\"Bierdeckel\") on top of your glass, and the \"Köbes\" will not automatically refill you.  Bolkerstraße, Flingerstraße (Uerige), Ratinger Straße and Kurzestraße are the main places where you find all kinds of pubs and breweries. A variation of the Altbier is called Krefelder. It's an Altbier with Coke.\n\nDuring summer months the Altstadt will come alive after work. People standing outside the pubs and enjoying their beer and good company. This will be especially so on ",{"type":"'''","value":["Wednesday"]}," evenings on ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ratingerstraße"]},". The street will be packed full of people with a great chilled atmosphere. Be aware though of broken glass on the cobbled street. But if you have a chance to go, do not miss it.\n\nBesides Altstadt, which some might consider to be slightly artificial, there are many others places around the city to enjoy beer or cocktails as well. During the last years, Medienhafen (Media Harbour) has become one of very popular quarters; especially during the summer. Other, rather non-touristic areas, include Pempelfort (Nordstraße), Unterbilk (Lorettostraße, Düsselstraße), Oberkassel (Luegallee), and Düsseltal (Rethelstraße).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Düsseldorf - Julo-Levin-Ufer (Am Handelshafen) 02 ies.jpg"],["250px"],["thumbnail"],["right"],["Many new hotels were opened in the Hafen area"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Budget"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Jugendherberge Düsseldorf (Backpackers)"],["alt=City-Hostel"],["url=http:\/\/www.duesseldorf.jugendherberge.de"],["email=duesseldorf@jugendherberge.de"],["address=Düsseldorfer Straße 1"],["lat=51.22669"],["long=6.75810"],["directions=located in Düsseldorf-Oberkassel on the left side of the city"],["phone =+49   211 557 310"],["tollfree="],["fax=+49 (0)211572513"],["checkin="],["checkout="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Rheingoldhotel Düsseldorf City"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.rheingoldhotel.de"],["email="],["address=Oststraße 166"],["lat=51.21924"],["long=6.78421"],["directions="],["phone =+49 211 361-1390"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["price="],["content=Family-run hotel, situated in the city center between the Central Train Station and the Oldtown."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Backpackers Düsseldorf"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.backpackers-duesseldorf.de\/"],["email=info@backpackers-duesseldorf.de"],["address=Fürstenwall 180, 40215 Düsseldorf"],["lat=51.21407"],["long=6.77956"],["directions=Bus no. 725 direction Hafen \/ Lausward leaves from main station (Hbf) front of the Sparkasse bank.
