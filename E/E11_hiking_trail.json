Many parts are covered with forest or at least commercial wood, but open agrarian and unused land is there. Western Germany is crossed on a range of low hills, which came into existence during the last Ice age, about twelve thousand years ago. After the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Harz"]]}," mountains hardly any elevation is noticed. E11 often follows waterways for some time, crossing them with a ferry or a bridge, and at times lakes must be surrounded, for example in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Masuria"]]}," in Poland. Among the rivers followed and crossed are the ",{"type":"'''","value":["IJssel"]}," in the Netherlands, the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Elbe"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Havel"]}," in Germany, the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Oder"]}," or Odra on the border of Germany and Poland, and the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Vistula"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["Wisła"]},") in Poland. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nE11 originated in 1980 from a string of short German paths as an international trail between the sister cities of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Haarlem"]]}," in the Netherlands and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Osnabrück"]]}," in Germany and was immediately extended to the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Harz"]]}," mountains. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, E11 became one of many means to stimulate the integration of Western and formerly Eastern, now Central Europe. This is why it was prolonged in the 1990s to Berlin and then into Poland. As the congestion around ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amsterdam"]]}," made it impossible to keep up a pleasant routing from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Haarlem"]]},", the start was moved to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Scheveningen"]]},". At the regional international level, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Euregio"]]}," began to exploit the stretch between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Deventer"]]}," in the Netherlands and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Osnabrück"]]}," in Germany in a commercial way, hoping to underpin its efforts to bring the populations on both sides of the international border closer together. \n\nEthnic and historical differences are noticeable along the track. The openness of the landscape of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Western Netherlands"],["Holland"]]}," (that is the Western part of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Netherlands"]]},"), the rich agriculture more to the East, the landmarks of large Prussian estates and their endless fields, maintained or revived during the GDR, and the scars that centuries of German-Polish conflict and German and Soviet suppression drew - they are all visible along E11. This is corroborated by the fact that the Polish part of E11 is mostly in territories that were German until 1918 or even 1945. To enjoy your march along E11 more, you may read the encyclopaedic article about E11 European long-distance path in Wikipedia, where you'll also find hundreds of links to the townships along E11.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Prepare"]}," \nE11 requires no preparation beyond the norm for long-distance hiking (see ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hiking"]]}," and the \"Prepare\" section of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Appalachian_Trail#Prepare"],["Appalachian Trail"]]},"). Make sure you're in good physical condition, and have good equipment (don't go for cheap walking boots or a cheap backpack) and a good set of maps. Also make sure you have enough food and water to sustain yourself.\n\nIn parts of Poland the distances between places where one can sleep in a bed (rather than a tent) may be up to 35 km. If you don't feel like marching such distances (or even more if you lose your way), then carry a tent and sleeping bag. Be prepared for rain (and snow in winter) and wear fast-drying clothes if you plan to wash them during your trip. \n\nWith the help of the website of the German railway company ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.Bahn.com DB"]}]}," it is easy to divide E11 into sections that are feasible in a single holiday trip of two or three weeks. Apart from The Hague, Bad Bentheim, Osnabrück, Hannover, Halle (Saale), Berlin, Frankfurt (Oder), Poznań, Toruń and Olsztyn are cities from which one may easily get away by train. Hannover, Berlin and Poznań also offer air services. \n\nOnce you have determined the E11 section(s) you'll walk, see to it that you acquire all the maps recommended below for that stretch. This will take a couple of weeks, if not months, since not all shops and publishers respond quickly. \n\nIn the Netherlands and Western Germany you will normally be understood if you communicate in English, but take basic vocabularies in German and Polish with you if you go further East. It helps if you learn to pronounce names and other words in the Dutch, German, Polish way, because an outspoken anglophone accent is a severe handicap when you want to find your way or are hungry.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]}," \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Vipera aspis Lothringen 044 .jpg"],["thumb"],["150x100px"],["right"],["The poisonous adder"]]},"\nThe biggest danger along E11 is hardly visible: the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pests#Ticks"],["tick"]]},". The danger is not so much in this tiny animal itself, although its bite might occasionally cause an infection. The danger is in the parasites it may carry. Along the whole track, ticks are known to be infected (sometimes up to high percentages) with Lyme disease. East of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Harz"]]}," mountains they may also carry tick-borne meningoencephalitis. You should carefully read the corresponding articles in Wikipedia or elsewhere, and get your vaccinations against tick-borne meningo-encephalitis before you venture into the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Harz"]]}," area or further East. There is no prophylaxis against Lyme disease, but this can be cured with antibiotics. \n\nApart from the occasional encounter with an adder, a boar, a pack of wolves or even a lynx, or a bite from any rabies infected mammal, the path is otherwise perfectly safe and may even be followed in winter, provided one is adequately dressed and carries enough food and (hot) drinks. The Polish winter is long and cold! If you don\"t carry a tent, make sure that you can cover distances of 35 km as lodgings (and bus stops!) are sometimes scarce in Poland.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]}," \nThe start of E11 in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Scheveningen"]]}," is easily reached from all corners of the world: fly to Schiphol, the airport of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amsterdam"]]},", take one of the very frequent trains to \"Den Haag CS\", one of the railway stations of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["The Hague"]]},", and tramway 9 will bring you to the Kurhaus at the square of \"Gevers Deynootplein\". It is also possible to take an international train from Belgium or France to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rotterdam"]]}," and change trains there for Den Haag CS. International trains from Germany offer a connection to Den Haag CS with a change of trains in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Utrecht"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amersfoort"]]},". Coming from England, one would normally arrive by fast ferry from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Harwich (England)"],["Harwich"]]}," to the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hook of Holland"]]}," and then follow the white-red marked European Coast Path ",{"type":"[[","value":[["E9 European Coast Path"],["E9"]]}," to Scheveningen. \n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:ScheveningenKuurhotel.jpg"],["thumb"],["400px"],["where E11 begins: the Kurhaus in Scheveningen"]]}," \nRamblers starting from the UK and Ireland, who want to reach the start of E11 on foot, should make sure that they reach Harwich along the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Essex Way"]]},", from where they should take the ferry to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hook of Holland"]]}," and then follow E9 as mentioned above. It is also possible to reach Scheveningen by the same E9 from the South of England, North-western France and the Belgian coast. Another possibility to reach the Hook of Holland on foot is by ",{"type":"[[","value":[["E2"]]}," (also known as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["GR 5"]]},") from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nice"]]},", the East of France and almost all of Belgium. \n\nBy the way, the Gevers Deynootplein in front of the Kurhaus is not the kind of place where you park your car whilst rambling the 2,500 km of E11. Even if you manage to find a free parking space, you will have to pay several Euros an hour.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Walk"]}," \nWith the exception of the article you are now reading, the precise routing of E11 is not at all documented in the English language. If you are fluent enough in Dutch and German, you will reach the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Harz mountains"]]}," without problems, but in Eastern Germany and Poland even detailed sources in the local languages (German and Polish) are hard to find. For this article we obtained and translated a German out-of-print book, and flyers and other documents from offices of rambling organizations in Kassel, Prague, Poznan, Torun and Olsztyn, as well as locally sold topographic maps. Some sections are marked in a locally meaningful way; others are not.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" E11 in the Netherlands (355 km) "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:LAW3.png"],["thumb"],["Marskramerpad and other long-distance footpaths in the Netherlands"]]},"\nIn The Netherlands, E11 is identical to the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Marskramerpad"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["Peddlers Way"]},"), which links ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Scheveningen"]]}," over 368 kilometers to the German township of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bad Bentheim"]]},". The last 13 km are on German territory, which leaves 355 km for the Dutch territory. Like most Dutch long distance trails, the Marskramerpad is managed by ",{"type":"'''","value":["Wandelnet"]}," where ",{"type":"'''","value":["Wandelnet: \"Marskramerpad\""]},", ed. by Wandelnet, Amersfoort, 2009, ISBN 978-90-71068-78-2, a guide in Dutch with very useful detailed maps can be bought. This booklet must be used in the reverse order, i.e. the map showing Scheveningen is the last map in the guide. This may explain why the cover text of the guide erroneously states that the Dutch part of E11 begins in the German town of Bad Bentheim. \n\nDutch hiking trails, including the Marskramerpad, are usually perfectly marked. However, ramblers must be warned that trails are often changed, sometimes in a major way, and these changes are only described in Dutch ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/wandelnet.nl\/routewijzigingen-marskramerpad-law-3\/meldingen"]},". At the moment of updating this text in WikiVoyage (December 2012), 55 changes were mentioned ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/wandelnet.nl\/marskramerpad-law-3-0"]},".\n\nNot all changes are small. One of them (between Achterveld and Terschuur) amounts to an extra 8 km (5 mi), on top of the 360 km mentioned on the cover of the guide. This is why 4 maps in the booklet (\"kaart 42\", 42A, 43 and 44) have been modified completely. It is therefore advisable to order the guide and also check the markings of the Marskramerpad in the field for recent changes. Just on the main heading of the page you find four bottoms, of which the second from left produces a very detailed map of the most recent routing of the trail (use the zoom function). Elsewhere on the page, on the right side, you find a button called ",{"type":"''","value":["overnachtingsadressen"]},". Clicking on that one gives you the addresses of lodgings along the trail. \n\nIt is possible to download a ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/GPStracks.nl\/wandelroutes-law.php?id=2209 GPS trail"]}]}," of a recent version of the Marskramerpad. This is a private publication, and is not issued or checked by Wandelnet. It probably does not cover all changes in the routing either. For copyright reasons, neither this GPS track, nor a precise description of the routing can be given here, but the links in the following paragraphs offer the possibility to find more information about the towns along the trail. \n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Huis ten Bosch close-up.JPG"],["thumb"],["Huis ten Bosch (the Queen's home)"]]},"\nThe Netherlands section of E11 crosses from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Scheveningen"]]}," through the town centre of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["The Hague"]]},", then turns North-east to pass the Queen's palace Huis ten Bosch, continues into the estates of Wassenaar, passes the mansion of Crown Prince Willem Alexander of Orange, leaves the wooded land to go between some pastures, enters the large village of Voorschoten and proceeds to the second largest old town centre of the Netherlands, that of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Leiden"]]},". It goes on by Leiderdorp and Zoeterwoude-Rijndijk through authentic polders and wetlands past Hoogmade and through picturesque ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Woubrugge"]]}," to Rijnsaterwoude, the lowest point of the trail at 5 meters below sea level. On it goes by ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nieuwkoop"],["Nieuwveen"]]}," and Zevenhoven to Noorden and the town of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Breukelen"]]}," which has a railway station. After Maartensdijk, the scenery changes from wetlands into wooded dunes, through which the city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amersfoort"]]}," is reached. Here you find intercity trains back to The Hague and Leiden, on to cities like Osnabruck, Hannover and Berlin, and, in case you want to leave the track for a day, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amsterdam"]]},". Amersfoort itself, however, has enough to offer for a day or two of rest. \n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Nijkerk - Appelsestraat 25, Schaapskooi.JPG"],["thumb"],["Sheepfold in Appel, Nijkerk"]]},"\nAfter Amersfoort and Leusden, the Marskramerpad\/E11 enters a broad wet valley that consisted of marshes in the early Middle Ages, but was turned into little polders from 1000 years ago onward. The trail passes Achterveld, Terschuur and Appel in the region called ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gelderse Vallei"]]},". We are now in the municipality of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nijkerk"]]},", where the first settlers of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New York City"]]}," came from (Kiliaen van Rensselaer was a merchant from Amsterdam, but his family owned the still existing farmhouse \"Rensselaer\" between Nijkerk and Putten, and he was so fond of the local population that he took many of their sons to what is now Manhattan). \n\nThis area is also the gate to the woods and forests of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Veluwe"]]},", the largest area covered with trees in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Netherlands"]]},".

But then the scenery becomes open and wet again, whilst Klarenbeek (train station) and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Voorst"]]}," are passed. The trail now follows the river IJssel for a while, passes under two large bridges with motorways, and then takes a ferry into the old city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Deventer"]]}," (under certain circumstances, such as flooding or ice on the river, the ferry will not go and you will have to cross the IJssel by the second bridge). \n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Deventer.jpg"],["thumb"],["Deventer seen from across the IJssel"]]},"\nDeventer is the first township in the region of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Salland"]]}," and the province of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Overijssel"]]},".

Hikers who pass through Deventer before walking into Germany, may profit from a visit to the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.deWandelwinkel.nl Wandelwinkel"]}]},", a bookshop specialized in publications about hiking and related outdoor sports, where all German detailed maps are in stock. The shop is opposite the Bergkerk (Mountain Church; it is built on a little hill) in the most picturesque part of the town. Diepenveen, Lettele, Okkenbroek and Espelo are small villages surrounded by open agrarian land, but the Marskramerpad\/E11 then climbs on a range of hills near the town of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Holten"]]}," (train station). We now enter the region of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Twente"]]},". Soon a further broad valley with open fields is reached and the trail meanders toward the interesting town of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Delden"]]},". Instead of crossing the town, the path prefers the beauty of the estate of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Twickel"]]},", then curbs North to Azelo and Zenderen, touches the newest residential areas of Borne and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hengelo"]]},", and passes Deurningen on its way to charming ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oldenzaal"]]},". \n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Oldenzaal Palthehuis.jpg"],["thumb"],["upright"],["Oldenzaal, Museum Palthehuis"]]}," \nThe railway station of Oldenzaal is a crossroads of long-distance footpaths, such as the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Naoberpad"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Noaberpad"]]}," on the Dutch and German border, and various Dutch trails. E11 continues Southeast, avoiding various settlements in the area, and finally crosses the German border just before the village of Gildehaus, a part of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bad Bentheim"]]},".

The markings date back to the time that this section was part of the Töddenweg: a white capital T on a black background. Bad Bentheim is also the first remarkable elevation, contrasting with the flat- and wetlands and occasional dunes of the Netherlands. Bad Bentheim has an interesting castle and museum and a charming little town centre with a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["spa"]]}," in the woods nearbye. \n\nIn the rest of Germany, E11 follows some old regional trails, notably the Töddenweg, the Wittekindsweg (Widukind's Way) and part of the Wesergebirgsweg. A remnant of the Wanderweg Harz - Niederlande (Hiking Trail Harz - Netherlands) and a newly created routing in the former GDR form the rest of E11 in Germany. The path crosses former West-Germany on a chain of ridges running from West to East, then passes the Harz Mountains without going high, and finally gives an impression of the large-scale agrarian enterprises that were founded by the Brandenburg-Prussian nobility in the 17th century, and continued to exist in the form of People's Owned Companies during the GDR. \n\nE11 is normally marked in various regional ways and only rarely is one reminded that one follows a European trail. It is therefore absolutely necessary to know the names of these trails and their symbols, as given below. Since they appear both as marks on trees and walls, and on detailed maps in which the trails are indicated, no further knowledge of the German language is needed to reach the Polish border. These maps are normally found in local bookshops only, but specialized may have maps from other areas in stock.

As 30% of Poland is covered with forest, it will not be surprising to find that most of E11 crosses through vast areas with trees (mostly planted and exploited in a commercial way), and various forms of wild nature, such as lakes and dunes. Near Poznań, however, the rambler walks for days through agrarian and semi-industrial land, made pleasant by some ancient towns and buildings. \n\nAs Poland is rather scarcely populated, the more so when going East, ramblers without tents must be prepared for daily distances between 25 and 35 kilometers. Where the routing is shown in detail below, the distance from the beginning of the section is added to the name of a township to indicate that the town offers some form of accommodation. For example, \"Wronki (88 km)\" in the section \"Międzyrzecz - Poznań-Kiekrz\" means that there is a hostel, hotel or other accommodation in the town of Wronki, 88 kilometers after Międzyrzecz. \n\nNo Polish regional trail is, as a whole, part of E11. The trail rather jumps from one existing trail to another, generally after following such a trail over a short distance only. Moreover, E11 is not indicated in the field as such, with a few exceptions which may add up to one sign every 100 km. The regional trails are marked, however, although not always well enough to enable the rambler to find E11 without a map. The marking system is always the common Central European, i.e. white-colored-white, but due to the many changes from one trail to another, the color varies a lot. This is why, in the details of the routing of each section below, the color of the markings is indicated. For example, \"Drzecin (yellow)\" means that in Drzecin, E11 begins to follow a trail marked with yellow stripes on a white square.  \n\nSome topographical maps show sections of E11, but others may only show the trails that form the basis for it. It is therefore necessary to fall back on documents describing which sections of which trails form E11 together.

E11 and the black bicycle trail turn right to follow the green trail over several kilometers and across a paved road, until finally all black or green markings disappear. Here one should follow white-blue-white markings which, after another kilometer, turn out to mark the same trail as the green hiking and black biking routes. The scale of the topo-map, 1:100,000, does not allow to display all these details, so that a good sense of direction (assisted by a compass and sunny weather) is required. \n\nThe combined blue, green and black routes reach a second tar road, which they follow to the left (North) over a few hundred meters. The green and black signs are nowhere to be seen, but the blue trail turns right into a sandy forest path and the map indicates that this is E11. After about a kilometer, the markings leave the path and invite the rambler to find his steps among the trees. The blue stripes are now corroborated by green stripes (both on a white square) and are convincingly frequent, so that it is quite frustrating to learn that both routes, after splitting up, die somewhere in the forest and the dunes.

E11, now invisible, turns right in the little park around the lake, not far from the railway station, and immediately right again, to follow the waterside toward the medieval Benedictine monastery. E11 turns left (East) along a busy narrow road to Bystrzyca, where it turns into a backstreet to Olsza. The lengthy village street of Podgaj and Kawka delivers the rambler at the lonely motel of Goryszewo Kwieciszewo. The exact routing in this part of the trail is: ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mogilno"]]}," - Bystrzyca - Olsza - Goruszewo - ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kwieciszewo"]]}," (51 km). \n\nHere, the first white-red-white stripes since Mogilno are found. These fail to mark where E11 leaves the main road and hops to a dirt road running parallel to the main road, a few hundred meters to the South. The dirt road itself is scarcely marked until the entrance of a forest; then the marking activities have stopped completely. Ramblers who go straight through the wood, find red markings at the other side. E11 passes through Jeziorki and follows a sandy dirt road to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Strzelno"]]}," (the hotel indicated on maps in this town has shut its doors many years ago). After Strzelno, a Polish ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Way of St. James"]]}," follows more or less the same route as the E11, so that the yellow and blue shells yield an alternative marking. E11 and the Way of St. James pass the attractive baroque church of Strzelno and the nearby village of Starczewo and, via Ksiaż, reach Polanowice. In this soviet-industrial village two rusty signs with white-red-white stripes are found, which still clearly indicate E11 (200 km after the previous E11 sign!).

Somewhere among its scattered farmhouses, E11 turns right into a skewed dirt road that enters a forest, passes a military site (not on the map), curves to the North and turns right after about one kilometer into a sandy road that curves to the Northeast. All the time passing through the forests of Błoto Ostrowskie, E11 follows this sandy road without curves over almost three kilometers, until it reaches a T-junction and a wooded bank. The main road turns sharp right; a minor path goes left; E11 however breaks through the wooded bank into a large piece of grassland. If one enters the field and keeps to the left, one finds the next white-red-white stripes on a lonely tree in the grassland.

E11 makes a few curves through the nature conservation area of Zbiczno lake and meets a trail marked green.

It enters some of the most gratifying and adventurous pieces of wild nature in the area, reducing the distance by about 20 km.)

The museums and shops invite to a day of rest, before one sets out to follow E11 on the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Copernicus Path"]]},". Its red markings lead from the PTTK office to the North of the city and under a huge railway viaduct. The trail follows the western bank of the river Lyna, but the eastern bank offers a number of attractions, including a canopy walk and a rope bridge over the river. After the Smętka bridge the city noises are no longer heard and the trail becomes a quiet footpath through river bank wood. The village of Dywity used to be on the trail, but is now passed at a distance. Wood dominates until the rural settlement of Swobodna; fields and pastures follow, while E11 and the St. James Way pass the pilgrim's hostel of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Głotowo"]]}," and the provincial town of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dobre Miasto"]]},".

Chmury - Swobodna - ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Głotowo"]]}," (32 km) - ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dobre Miasto"]]}," (37 km). \n\nFrom Dobre Miasto a narrow paved road with busy traffic leads E11 Northwest through Kunik. After this village the red markings of the Copernicus Path and E11 turn right into a one-lane paved road that gives access to the bishop's palace of Smolajny. There is no doubt that the trail swarves over the clerical grounds, then crosses another paved road and enters the open fields at the other side of the road. But when, after about 1 km, it enters a marsh, all traces of markings are vanished. No path seems to continue from here, except for an overgrown cart track that leads back to the church grounds. The only way out of this maze is to go back to the paved road and take it to the left (Northeast) through the village of Smolajny up to its ending at National Motorway #51. This must then be followed over 5 km until a large parking space and rest area is reached. Here one finds the red markings again; they lead into wood and later through a puszta type of landscape, pass the lonely and almost deserted village of Wróblik to Pilnik, a residential neighbourhood of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lidzbark Warmiński"]]},".

It is tempting to go straight to the vast town centre and find a bed, but the E11 turns right, leaving the town again, it seems, to follow the black markings of a local trail that joins the river Lyna and follows its meandering valley. For some obscure reason this walk avoids most of the medieval beauties of the town and passes along some apartment buildings from the communist era to the railway station. For those who stick to the precise course of E11, a second deception follows after the uninteresting railway station: A trail marked blue takes them back along the same apartment buildings to the entry of the Lyna valley, allows a view of the Knights' Castle and then leaves the town. It is therefore advisable to spend a day in Lidzbark Warmiński to visit the many remnants of medieval Christian Knighthood. \n\nThe blue trail will carry E11 over 69 km to Kętrzyn, but sets out by visiting a war cemetery from the First World War. Straight East it goes then to the monastery of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Stoczek Klasztorny (Warmiński)"]]},", where pilgrims on the St. James' Way and other ramblers may find a simple meal and a bed. The blue trail continues through open land and over the long main street of Sulowo to charming ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bisztynek"]]},", another town reminiscent of the medieval German Knights. An old railway track carries E11 out of town to the East and on a sandy road more or less parallel to the old track, the extended village of Sątopy-Samulewo is reached. E11 goes straight, past a new settlement of apartment blocks and to an older settlement where it turns right. The paved road becomes a gravel road, the gravel makes place for sand, then grass, and after a while the rambler must find a thorny way by going straight and noticing the occasional blue mark. When a paved road is reached, E11 follows it to the left and finally reaches the next medieval town, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Reszel"]]}," which also offers an unusual rich variety of dishes. The townships passed are Lidzbark Warmiński - Sarnowo - ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Stoczek Klasztorny (Warmiński)"]]}," (80 km) - Kiwity (85 km) - Rokitnik (88 km; hotel at 1 km) - Sulowo - ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bisztynek"]]}," (94 km) - ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nowe Wieś Reszelska"]]}," - ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sątopy-Samulewo"]]}," - Troksy - Biel - Czarnowiec - ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Reszel"]]}," (114 km). \n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Rößel.

It offers beds in a pilgrim house and accommodation in hotels for every budget, and the company of bus loads of tourists. After this busy beehive, E11 finds the silence of a detour through forest and a long walk over an old railway track through fields to the industrial village of Smokowo. A feeder road brings the rambler to a main road with heavy traffic. This highway, followed to the right (East) ends up at the beginning of the long high street of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kętrzyn"]]},". This is mainly a flourishing modern provincial town, but it lodges some memories of the medieval past. It also harbors the last railway station before the ending of E11, about 300 km further.
