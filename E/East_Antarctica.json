The ",{"type":"'''","value":["Southern pole of inaccessibility"]}," is the furthest point in Antarctica from any coastline, although the exact location is disputed due to the difficulty in defining Antarctica's coastline—whether to consider the \"solid\" coastline where rock\/soil reaches sea level or factor in the massive, but ever-changing ice sheets. A modern calculation puts its location at 85°50′S 65°47′E. The British Antarctic Survey has calculated its position as 82°53′14″S 55°4′30″E when accounting only for the Antarctic land surface proper or at 83°50′37″S 65°43′30″E when ice sheets are taken into account. The Soviet Union built the ",{"type":"''","value":["Pole of Inaccessibility"]}," station at 82°06′S 54°58′E, 878 km (546 mi) from the geographical South Pole, and at an elevation of 3,800 m (12,467 ft). However, the station was only occupied from 14–26 December 1958 before it was suspended indefinitely because of safety concerns that it was too far from other Soviet stations. While the Soviets planned to use the station afterwards for short visits, only a handful of people ever since have visited the site, which is now buried by snow except for a bust of Vladamir Lenin perched atop its roof. The Soviet station and other calculated coordinates for the pole of accessibility are all unremarkable and, as the name suggests, difficult to reach. Only the most extreme adventurers itching to cross \"I've been to the most inaccessible corner of Antarctica\" off their dream list are likely to be interested in visiting the pole of inaccessibility.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Itineraries"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Antarctica"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Geo"],["-76"],["69"],["zoom=3"],["layer=A"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:East Antarctica"]]}]
