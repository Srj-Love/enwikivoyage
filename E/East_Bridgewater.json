It resides in southeastern Massachusetts, about forty minutes south of Boston.  Brockton borders the town to the west and Bridgewater to the south.  Taunton is about twenty minutes southwest.  The results of elections show a pattern of liberal voting.

The easiest approach is to exit Route 24 in West Bridgewater and follow Route 106 to Route 18 north.  Rt. 106 passes through town from the West Bridgewater border to the Halifax border.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nEast Bridgewater has little in the way of public transportation.

However, tickets are cheap, so this is a great choice when you want to see a movie but are short on funds and do not care about high-end visual and audio equipment, size, or seating.  The theater’s weekly Rocky Horror Picture Show event was recently cancelled indefinitely, though formerly it was a popular ritual.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nAlmost every business in town is a restaurant or convenience store.
