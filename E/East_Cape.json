However, the East Cape is generally referred to as the entire geographical cape between the east of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Opotiki"]]}," and the north of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gisborne"]]},". This area of New Zealand has a strong Maori presence and influence, with 88 percent of the population being Maori and 45 percent speaking Maori (compared to 14 percent and 4 percent respectively for New Zealand). Historical, cultural and economic ties to ancestrial land are a main contributing factor to this unique demography. Unemployment, poverty and isolation are common on the East Cape. However, its inhabitants generally offer a warm welcome to travelers.\n\nTravelers who are interested in the Maori way of life, or who love getting off the beaten track, should find this region fascinating. Travelers making their way through this region should be aware of cultural aspects such as Tapu (sacred) areas such as burial grounds and Rahui (temporary ban) on fishing.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nMaori is spoken regularly by nearly half of the East Cape region's population.
