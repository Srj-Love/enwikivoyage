",{"type":"[[","value":[["Suzhou"]]}," was another important city, famous for its gardens, canals and silk. It was the capital of the Kingdom of Wu at a time when China was divided.\n\nIn the 19th century, China lost two \"Opium Wars\" to foreign powers, and was forced to open certain ",{"type":"[[","value":[["List_of_Chinese_provinces_and_regions#Treaty_ports_and_concessions"],["Treaty Ports"]]}," to foreign trade in the treaties that ended those wars. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ningbo"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai"]]}," were opened in the 1840s, after the first war; both developed very rapidly after that. Until then, Shanghai was not a particularly significant town, though it did enjoy a strategic position at the mouth of the great Yangtze River, but by the early 20th century Shanghai became one of the world's richest and wildest cities. After the second war in the 1860s, cities further inland up the Yangtze were opened  — ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nanjing"]]}," and Hankou (now part of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wuhan"]]},"). They also developed considerably and the region as a whole did quite well from then until the 1930s.\n  \nThen everything went wrong; this region was one of the areas of China that Japan succeeded in conquering, and they suffered horrendously under Japanese occupation, 1937 to 1945. Then there were the Chinese Civil War, 1945-1949, the Great Leap Forward in the 50s, and the Cultural Revolution 1966-1976; all caused severe problems in this region.\n\nIn the \"reform and opening up\" since 1978, this area has benefited enormously. Shanghai is again definitely one of the world's greatest cities, and Hangzhou, Suzhou and Nanjing are not far behind. All are very modern cities with lots of large new roads and buildings, and all have subway systems either in service or under construction. Between the cities are both more large new roads and an extensive rail network including many fast efficient ",{"type":"[[","value":[["High-speed rail in China"],["bullet train"]]}," links. More of everything is under construction; cranes are visible everywhere. The entire region is a hive of industry, one of the most prosperous in China. It is a magnet for migrants from poorer regions who come here in droves seeking work.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nAs anywhere in China, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chinese phrasebook"],["Mandarin"]]}," is the lingua franca; nearly everyone can speak it except some of the elderly. As elsewhere in China, English is not widespread but some people speak it quite well.\n\nThe region does have its own language group, called ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wu phrasebook"],["Wu"]]},". This is a populous region and the number of Wu speakers is large. The language is also referred to as Shanghai dialect or Shanghainese, though that is not strictly accurate. There are local variants of Wu; the prestige dialect is that of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Suzhou"]]}," (an older city, capital of the Kingdom of Wu centuries back, and home to many scholars), ",{"type":"''","value":["not"]}," that of Shanghai. Wu is spoken over quite a broad area, including Shanghai, most of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zhejiang"]]},", parts of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jiangsu"]]}," and even a few places in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Anhui"]]},". Dialects of Mandarin are spoken natively in northern Jiangsu, such as the area around ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nanjing"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nPerhaps the commonest way to reach the area is to fly to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai"]]},". There are two airports in the city with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai Pudong International Airport"],["Pudong"]]}," as a major international airport with connections all over the world and Hongqiao that is closer to the centre and handles mainly domestic flights, plus some to nearby countries such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South Korea"]]},". Buses and the Metro line 2 connect the two, taking about an hour. There are also direct buses from Pudong airport to major cities in the region; see the city articles for details.\n\nShanghai Metro Line 2 (the main East-West line through downtown) goes to both airports and to the new Hongqiao train station right next to Hongqiao airport, which has ",{"type":"[[","value":[["High-speed rail in China"],["high-speed trains"]]}," to many places in the region and beyond. This is not a convenient way to get between the airports if you have a lot of luggage, because you need to change trains once. On the other hand, if you are travelling light and have a bit of time to spare, you can easily jump off somewhere in the middle for a quick look at central Shanghai.\n\nOther cities in the region, such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hangzhou"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nanjing"]]},", also have international airports. ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.airasia.com Air Asia's"]}," flight from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kuala Lumpur"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hangzhou"]]}," provides a low-cost route to or from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southeast Asia"]]},".\n\nThe area is also well connected via China's road and rail networks, and there are ferries from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Japan"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Suzhou"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nThe area is well-connected by China's rail and road networks.
