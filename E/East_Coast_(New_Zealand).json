Cook's landing is commemorated by a statue of him on the beach at Kaiti and replicas of his ship atop poles in Gisborne's main street.\n\nThe East Coast, particularly around East Cape, has a reputation for unemployment, poverty and isolation. Those who farm the land often have limited means and though they are able to live off the land and its produce, they are unable to derive a great income from it.  Much of the area is multi-owner Maori Land, which makes it difficult to obtain development finance. However the cost of living on ancestral land is far less than in the cities, so many Maori remain here because it is inexpensive and offers a different lifestyle.\n\nThis is the area of New Zealand where the film ",{"type":"''","value":["Whale Rider"]}," was set and filmed. The film portrays the country lifestyle fairly well.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.newmanscoach.co.nz\/ Newmans Coach Lines"]}," operates a premium sightseeing tours throughout the North Island. \n\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.intercity.co.nz\/ InterCity Coachlines"]}," is New Zealand's national coach company and operates over 150 services to more than 600 destinations nationwide. \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["State Highway 2"]}," passes through Poverty Bay on its way from the Bay of Plenty to the Hawkes Bay.

However, ",{"type":"'''","value":["freedom camping"]}," is permitted in many beach areas along the coastal highway. Campers need to provide all their own facilities and there are restrictions on what sort of camps can be set up and how long a stay can be, but there are no charges.
