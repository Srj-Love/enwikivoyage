As a result, its original Maroon characteristics are slowly being restored and expanded, and facilities for travellers are getting better fast. Many tour operators bring in their guests, who get to see the school, the church and usually one or two dances performed by villagers. Of course, they will also show you some of their handicrafts, hoping you'll be tempted to buy. Your guide or a hired local guide will tell you about life in the jungle, traditional use of its flora and the wooden houses where women would stay during their menstruation days. All in all, Santigron may not be the most authentic, but it surely is one of the most accessible Maroon villages to explore and will allow you to get a good idea of Maroon traditions. It's also one of the few where you could easily get by public transport (there are a few buses per week from Paramaribo) or bike.\n\nThere's no written history for the town, but its background is a story told from generation to generation and its current people will gladly tell it to you too. As with any told history, there are variations in the stories. In short, the settlement was established in the mid-19th century, as different Maroon tribes gathered around a historic wood plantation. When the owner died, he left the plantation to one of them, the first to have arrived and a leader of the group.
