Locally known as Østlandet (or Austlandet), literally the east country, and is defined by the border with Sweden and mountain ranges creating watersheds with Trøndelag and Western Norway. East Norway includes the densely populated lowlands around Oslofjord (and lake Mjøsa) and the more sparsely populated valleys, forests and highlands in the hinterland. The most populated lowlands\/flatlands greater Oslo, around Oslofjord and around lake Mjøsa is informally referred to as Central East Norway.\n\nA number of long valleys (notably ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gudbrandsdalen"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Valdres"]]},", Østerdal and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hallingdal"]]},") and rivers converge in the lowlands around Oslo. Oslo itself is separated from these rivers and valleys by forests and hills known as Oslomarka (the Oslo woodlands). Areas around Oslofjord and lake Mjøsa are mostly lowlands or flatlands, while upstream along the big valleys and rivers the gently rolling landscape gradually gives way to steep hills, barren highlands (such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hardangervidda"]]},") and alpine summits such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jotunheimen"]]},". These valleys also host transport corridors (rail and road) to West Norway and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Trøndelag"]]},". Western parts of Telemark, Buskerud and Oppland are part of the central mountains\/highlands, while northern parts of Oppland and Hedemark includes wide mountain areas such as Reinheimen, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dovre"]]}," and Rondane. East Norway is home to a large number of lakes, including several of Norway's largest. The shores of southern Oslofjord with myriads of polished islands and bays are popular summer resorts for city residents.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Tjøme Lilleskagen badestrand.JPG"],["thumb"],["200px"],["Typical \"svaberg\" (polished cliffs) at Tjøme"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nThe interior of Eastern Norway generally enjoys relatively dry continental climate (warm summers and cold winters).

Closer to Oslofjord the winters are milder, although temperatures below minus 10° C are common in Oslo, and summers are slightly warmer in sheltered valleys. Large parts of East Norway enjoys the rain shadow created by the central mountains, and some of East Norway gets less than 300 mm precipitation annually (less than Madrid).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Regions"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Regionlist"],["regionmap=EastNorway.png"],["regionmaptext=Regions on East Norway"],["regionmapsize=400px"],["region1name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Akershus"]]}],["region1color=#b5d29f"],["region1items="],["region1description=The region surrounding Oslo and home to many of Oslo's suburbs, and is largely part of Greater Oslo with about 1\/4 of Norway's population."],["region2name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Buskerud"]]}],["region2color=#b383b3"],["region2items="],["region2description="],["region3name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hedmark"]]}],["region3color=#ac5c91"],["region3items="],["region3description=The landlocked county in East Norway's deep interior, great valleys, rivers and forests"],["region4name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oppland"]]}],["region4color=#d56d76"],["region4items="],["region4description=From lakes and lowlands to the great mountains and highlands"],["region5name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oslo"]]}],["region5color=#578e86"],["region5items="],["region5description=Norway's capital"],["region6name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Østfold"]]}],["region6color=#71b37b"],["region6items="],["region6description=Lowlands east of Oslofjord"],["region7name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Telemark"]]}],["region7color=#d09440"],["region7items="],["region7description=From urban lowlands through green valleys to rugged highlands"],["region8name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vestfold"]]}],["region8color=#d5dc76"],["region8items="],["region8description=Lowlands west of Oslofjord"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Oslo"]]}," – the Norwegian capital; the demographic, economic and logistical centre for East Norway"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Drammen"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Fredrikstad"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Gjøvik"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Grenland"]]}]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Langesund"]]}]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Porsgrunn"]]}]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Skien"]]}]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Hamar"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Lillehammer"]]}," – the 1994 Winter Olympic venue and gate to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gudbrandsdalen"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Towns"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Drøbak"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Gardermoen"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Hønefoss"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Kongsberg"]]}," - silver mines and alpine ski slopes"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Larvik"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Notodden"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Rjukan"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Sandefjord"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Tønsberg"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Trysil"]]}," – Norway's largest ski resort"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Gudbrandsdalen"]]}," - the great central valley from lowlands at Lillehammer to the highest mountains"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Hallingdal"]]}," - a major valley from fertile lowlands at Drammen into ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hardangervidda"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Jotunheimen"]]}," - Scandinavia's highest mountains"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Valdres"]]}," - picturesque highlands, lakes and valleys beneath Jotunheimen"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Hardangervidda"]]}," – Europe's largest highland plateau"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nMost people will respond in English to any question you may have.
