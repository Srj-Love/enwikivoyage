While it's often overshadowed by the more picturesque villages around Rochester, it's a tight-knit community with few big chains and a lot of little gems waiting to be discovered.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nDespite the prominent presence of the train tracks through the village, no train stops here any more.  You'll need a car if you're going to visit East Rochester.\n\nThe most convenient access from the southeast and northwest is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Interstate 490"]},".  Eastbound, take exit 24 for Commercial Street.  Westbound there is no exit 24; take exit 25 and cross 31F to get to Commercial Street.

The CSX train tracks divide the village, resulting in a lot of dead ends as only two roads actually cross the tracks: Washington Street (State Route 153) and Lincoln Road.  You'll need to make your way to one or the other if you need to get across.  Just to make things more interesting, the main drag, Commercial Street, is discontinuous; West Commercial ends at Main Street, only to pick up again as East Commercial on the other side of a business complex.\n\nIn short, navigation is a pain if you don't have a route mapped out in advance.  Make sure you have a good map.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Festa Italia"],["url=http:\/\/festaitaliaer.com\/"],["email=rtalent@frontiernet.net"],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Edmond Lyon Park, corner of Main & East Ivy"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=6-8 Jun 2013, 11AM-11PM"],["price=$10 ($18\/couple) 4PM-9:30PM; free elsewhen"],["content=East Rochester is not known for its festivals, but this new one (started in 2012) aims to capitalize on the village's Italian heritage.
