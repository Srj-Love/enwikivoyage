It lies at the eastern end of the South Downs range of chalk cliffs and hills: its most famous topographical feature is Beachy Head, the highest chalk cliff in Southern England. To the east it is bordered by the low-lying flood plains of the Pevensey Levels and beyond. It has one of the highest recorded days of sunshine per year in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Britain"]]},".\n\nPart of the town's charm is its largely undeveloped seafront, devoid of the amusements and loud activity associated with Brighton, its bigger and brasher western cousin.  Eastbourne's front remains composed mainly of Victorian hotels, as much of Eastbourne has traditionally belonged to the Duke of Devonshire, who retains the rights to these buildings and refuses to allow them to be converted into shops.\n\nEastbourne has a reputation as a retirement town, and is also very popular with elderly day trippers on coach outings. The local council,however, perhaps aware of this dated image, have in recent years tried to persuade potential visitors to \"take another view\", with some success. Plans are afoot to regenerate the town centre, improving shopping facilities and access.\n\nThe lovely 1935 bandstand remains, and traditional seafront concerts still take place every day in the holiday season for those content to listen and laze in a deckchair.  The relative peace is only shattered in mid August by the biggest event of the year for the town, \"Airbourne\". This justifably and proudly claims to be the South Coast's biggest free air display, and takes place over the sea attracting visitors of all ages during its four days. Many come just to see the world famous RAF Red Arrows who are regular visitors, but there are many other attractions at ground level too.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nThe main roads into Eastbourne are the A27, which runs west to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brighton (England)"],["Brighton"]]},", and the A259, which heads east to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hastings (England)"],["Hastings"]]},". The A22 (joining the A27) goes north towards ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\nSouthern Railway is the principal train company serving Eastbourne. It is linked by train to the west with Brighton, and to the east with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bexhill"]]},", Hastings and Ashford International (for Eurostar services to France and Belgium). There is direct line to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]}," with trains running twice-hourly, journey time around 1 hour 25 minutes.\n\nFare and timetable information is available from ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.southernrailway.com\/"]},", or National Rail Enquiries- tel. 08457 484950 (local rate call, UK only number)\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nServices within Eastbourne borough are mainly operated by Stagecoach Buses Ltd, which is the successor of the company to the world's first municipal bus operator. Stagecoach Buses also operate country services to Tunbridge Wells, Heathfield, Uckfield, Willingdon, Polegate, Pevensey Bay, Hailsham, Bexhill and Hastings.\n\nHailsham, Pevensey Bay, Polegate, Willingdon and Hailsham are included in the local Eastbourne fare zonal system. Within the fare zone system there is an unlimited day rover ticket for £3.00, while single fares can be £1.90 as far as Polegate, rising to a higher price if continuing to Hailsham. A weekly ticket is available from the driver for £11.50 to cover this zone.\n\nTown services are covered by services 1, 1A, 2, 3, 5, 5A and the LOOP, while out of town services are covered by services 1X, 51 (251), 52 (252), 54, 98 and 99 (as at 28 November 2010).\n\nTo Hailsham: 1X, 51, 52, 54, 98;\nTo Bexhill and Hastings: 98, 99;\nTo Heathfield: 51 and 52;\nTo Tunbridge Wells: 251 and 252 (same buses as for Heathfield, which are then prefixed with a 2 from Heathfield);\nTo Pevensey Bay: 99\n\nBrighton is served by Brighton and Hove Buses on services 12 and 12X.  Brighton and Hove offer an excellent value all-day ticket for just £5.00 from the driver, or £3.50 if purchased in advance on the Internet, which includes the return journey between the two towns and unlimited travel in Brighton and Hove. Those travellers who also wish to use local services in Eastbourne as well as wanting to go to Brighton for the day with unlimited travel, may wish to purchase an Explorer ticket on a Stagecoach bus for £5.50, which then gives total unlimited travel on most services in Kent and Sussex for one day, including all Stagecoach, Arriva and Brighton & Hove. Beware, if purchasing the same explorer ticket on a Brighton and Hove Bus, it costs £7.00, so the same ticket from Stagecoach is better value.\n\nServices 12 and 12X serve East Dean, Seaford, Newhaven, Peacehaven, Rottingdean and Saltdean en route to Brighton from Eastbourne.\n\nEastbourne's art deco bus station closed some years ago, but almost all services now stop in a buses-only area of the main shopping precinct at Terminus Road, near the railway station.  There is no formal bus office in the town centre, but information and timetables are posted at all stops in the central area. Limited bus information can be obtained from the Tourist Information office in Cornfield Road.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\n\n\"Black cabs\" are rarely seen on Eastbourne's streets, but taxis licensed by the local authority are readily available at all times from ranks either side of the railway station.\n01323 720720, 01323 726726.\n\nFor Pre Booked Journeys try:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["MS Executive Chauffeurs ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.msexecutive.co.uk\/"]}," - 0800 980 7252"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Sussex Chauffeurs"]}," http:\/\/www.sussexchauffeur.co.uk\/"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Eastbroune Pier.jpg"],["thumb"],["The Pier in Eastbourne"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The world-famous seafront ",{"type":"'''","value":["Carpet Gardens"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" The Victorian pier, adorned with shops and traditional amusements, fast food cafes, a bar and night club and a \"Camera Obscura\" offering a different perspective on the town."]},{"type":"*","value":[" The \"Redoubt Fortress\", now housing a military museum but built to defend the area during the Napoleonic wars."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Eastbourne Beachy Head.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Cliffs and lighthouse at the Beachy Head, Eastbourne"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Enjoy the views from ",{"type":"'''","value":["Beachy Head"]}," - at 162m, the highest chalk sea cliff in Britain.

Don't forget to take a picnic, though Birling Gap is a pleasant beauty spot on this part of the coast, which looks particularly nice in Spring and has an excellent pub, restaurant and hotel.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nWhile it does not perhaps offer the same range as other more fashionable shopping areas like Brighton or Tunbridge Wells, Eastbourne has a good mix of the familiar \"high street\" names and unusual retailers. The Arndale Centre is the main shopping mall, located in Terminus Road which itself has a wide selection of shops. Everything from books to bakeware, candles to coffee can be bought in the mall which has a light and airy feel thanks to its atrium layout allowing in plenty of natural light.  This is a popular area at all times, but particularly with children at school holidays when activities and an enchanting tableau are usually laid on in the central area between Boots and BhS.\n\nThe Enterprise Centre next to the station is another often forgotten treasure. Although it has a feel of faded glory and better days hopefully more visitors will take it back to the vibrant place it once was because it is a gem. Under one roof is everything you might need - fresh fruit and veg, a butchers and a fishmongers. Plus an amazing bookshop which has thousands of new and secondhand books plus a great ordering service for any book. There is a shop full of Wedding Dresses with service second to none (there are other wedding services there too) and a fair trade shop which is excellent. There are also opticians, complimentary therapy, a hair dressers and a beautician. A pet shop. A wonderful cafe called Jocelyn's where you can get gorgeous cakes, delicious soup and service with a smile!\n\nFor those with more eclectic tastes, \"Little Chelsea\" is a good area to visit.  While it's hard to ignore the several funeral directors in South Street and Grove Road, reflecting the higher than average proportion of aged residents of the town, there are many shops for those who want to live life to the full, whatever their age. Particularly recommended is Camilla's second-hand bookshop with books on just about every subject imaginable, Mr & Mrs Doaks Bumper Bookshop selling children's books including a child-friendly teashop, a Belgian chocolate emporium and a Bang and Olufsen hi-fi and TV specialist dealer.\n\nThe 2 km long road known as \"Seaside\" (somewhat confusingly, just inland from the seafront) is like a mini-town in itself, with two bank branches, post offices, convenience stores, antique and curio shopping, furnishers, kitchen and carpet suppliers.  This is the main A259 road, and leads northwards to Langney, where there is a district shopping with a Tesco Metro, Iceland, Family Bargains and several other smaller stores.\n\nAdmiral Retail Park houses a large Tesco Extra store, Pets at Home, Homebase, Argos, Vokins, Wickes, McDonalds Drive-thru and Pizza Hut.\n\nCrumbles Retail Park comprises Asda, Next, Boots, Matalan, Harvey's, Brantano, Cineworld Cinema, Blockbusters and Frankie & Bennys, which adjoins the man-made Sovereign Harbour development, which also houses a number of small shops, bars and restaurants.\n\nSainsbury's Retail Park in Hampden Park houses a Sainsbury's Superstore, Comet and a Currys\/PC World, adjacent to which is the David Lloyd Centre and Lloyds Lanes Bowling Alley. Not barely a stone's throw away are also B&Q, Dunelm Mill, Maplin's, Halfords and Mothercare.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nAs would be expected of a seaside resort, Eastbourne offers food to suit all tastes, budgets and time demands.  There are plenty of fast food outlets including McDonalds and Wimpy in Terminus Road.  However, for those wanting something a little more traditional, the best fish and chip restaurants include Seaquel and Qualisea, both around the junction of Terminus Road and Seaside Road, or the Dolphin fish bar on Seaside. \nFresh seafood and shellfish can be obtained from Perrywinkles http:\/\/www.perrywinkles.co.uk just east of the pier or if you are in self-catering accommodation, why not buy and cook local catches as fresh as can be from the wet fish shops alongside the fisherman's boat stores on the seafront walking east towards Princes Park. \nMany different cuisines are also on offer in Terminus Road, the main street for restaurants.  If you like a sea view along with good food and drink, try the Cafe Belge at the seaward end of Terminus Road, which offers around 80 Belgian beers along with a menu reflecting the culinary traditions of Belgium.\nDevelopment on the seafront itself is limited, but the hotel restaurants are always worth a try, as are the cafes and kiosks on the lower promenade, including some recently opened in former seafront shelters.  Eastbourne seems to be trying to follow the lead of Brighton in making more of its beachfront for food and entertainment and several cafes and restaurants now open into the late evening on the shoreline.\n\nThere is also a good choice of bars and restaurants available in the Sovereign Harbour Marina development.\n\nPlenty of good eating places in Eastbourne\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nEastbourne has plenty of pubs ranging from the traditional to the trendy. Particularly recommended for those who love- or want to try- the best local \"real ale\" are The Marine on Seaside, which also offers an excellent restaurant and bar menu- all day on Sundays.   The Marine ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.thelamb-eastbourne.co.uk"]}," is always a friendly and comfortable place, but is at its best around Christmas time, when an extraordinary array of festive lights turns it into a fairyland to enchant young and old alike. \nAlso recommended are The Terminus, a recently refurbished Harveys of Lewes pub in the town centre, and The Lamb ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.thelamb-eastbourne.co.uk"]},", the oldest pub in Eastbourne in the Old Town area. \nMost nightclubs are situated in Langney, Pevensey and Terminus Roads though the pier with the Atlantis nightspot is something of a honeypot for language students and other smart young things.\n\nIf you're looking for something refreshing but not intoxicating, there are plenty of stops for a cuppa and the usual coffee chains.  The Pavilion Tea Rooms, east of the pier, are recommended for afternoon tea when a piano player often adds to the polite, typically English ambience of the place.\ntry \nDolce Vita Ristorante\n\n Tel. 01323 747996\n\n117-119 Seaside Rd, Eastbourne, BN21 3P\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["drink"],["name=Dolce Vita Ristorante"],["url=http:\/\/www.dolcevita-ristrante.com"],["email="],["address=117-119 SEASIDE ROAD EASTBOURNE BN21 3PH"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +44 1323747996"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=ITALIAN RISTORANTE PIZZERIA"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nMost of the town's 4 and 5 star hotels are, unsurprisingly, located on the seafront and generally to the more rural-looking and higher Western end of the seafront.
