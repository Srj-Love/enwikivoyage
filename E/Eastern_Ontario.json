In this area, the English language is dominant culturally.\n# The Ottawa Valley Twang area is mainly in Renfrew County. In this area, an accent of the English language, called ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ottawa Valley"]]}," Twang is dominant. Often common phrases that are normally two words are pronounced as though there is no space between them (eg. \"Good day\" is pronounced as \"gidday\").\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nAlthough Eastern Ontario is situated in Canada, which has a reputation for being very cold, Eastern Ontario, being the part of Canada with the lowest average elevation, is in the \"Long Summer\/Short Winter\" belt of Southern Ontario and Southwestern Quebec, which is the only part of Canada in which the summer is significantly longer than the winter, although this region ends immediately north of Gatineau and west of Renfrew County. Summers in Eastern Ontario usually last from late May to mid-to-late September, and winters last about from late November\/early December to late March. Autumn and spring are very short (especially spring).\n\nThe first snowfalls of the year usually occur in November, but snow doesn't actually cover the ground until December. It has been known to snow in October, though it usually melts as soon as it hits the ground.\n\nIn the spring, the snow usually starts melting in March, although occasional \"warm breaks\" with temperatures as high as 10°C (50°F) usually occur once or twice in January and February, and snow flurries can still occur in April or even May.\n\nIn recent years, winters have gotten much warmer, so often in the winter freezing rain will occur, when it is not warm enough for rain but not cold enough for snow. Freezing rain is basically raining ice pellets, which makes driving very hazardous and often closes down schools and makes the roads very icy for a few days.\n\nIn the summer, humidity is often common, especially in July. Although temperatures are usually just under 30°C (86°F), humidity can make the temperature feel like its about 38°C (100°F). Humidex temperatures have even been known to reach 45°C (113°F).\n\nAverage Afternoon Temperatures Per Month:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" January: -6°C\/21°F"]},{"type":"*","value":[" February: -5°C\/23°F"]},{"type":"*","value":[" March: 5°C\/41°F"]},{"type":"*","value":[" April: 14°C\/57°F"]},{"type":"*","value":[" May: 20°C\/68°F"]},{"type":"*","value":[" June: 24°C\/75°F"]},{"type":"*","value":[" July: 29°C\/84°F"]},{"type":"*","value":[" August: 29°C\/84°F"]},{"type":"*","value":[" September: 23°C\/73°F"]},{"type":"*","value":[" October: 19°C\/66°F"]},{"type":"*","value":[" November: 7°C\/45°F"]},{"type":"*","value":[" December: -5°C\/23°F"]},"(Statistics based on temperatures in Eastern Ontario over the course of 2000-2005)\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Itineraries"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rideau Canal"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Trans-Canada Highway"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Windsor-Quebec corridor"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["45.0"],["-75.0"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Ontario"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Eastern Ontario"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["it:Ontario orientale"]]}]
