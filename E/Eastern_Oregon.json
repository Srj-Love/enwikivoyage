The Columbia River to the north provides world class wind surfing and kite sailing. The moderate wind speeds and large swells on the river can provide for some interesting viewing of these activities. On days when the wind is not blowing the wide river provides great water skiing and personal watercraft riding. Fishing is also popular on the Columbia. Depending on the time of year, the Columbia provides excellent walleye, sturgeon, steelhead, and salmon fishing.\n\nTo the west lies the wild Deschutes River. The Deschutes is famous for fly fishermen to test their luck at landing salmon, steelhead, and trout. It was once rumored that Tiger Woods even made the trip to test his luck.
