The region enjoys a certain degree of sovereignty within Panama, as constituted by the 'ley organica 16 de 1953'. The Congreso General Kuna, which meets twice a year, is the highest political authority of Kuna Yala. The economy of Kuna Yala depends mainly on agriculture, fishery and tourism industry.
