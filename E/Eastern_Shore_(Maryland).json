As a result, values tend to be conservative and closely related to Virginia, with which it shares a border, as opposed to the western portion of Maryland, which is perceived by locals as more liberal. For this reason, many residents take offense being compared to Marylanders from across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. This sense of alienation from the rest of Maryland has spurred several attempts to split off from the state of Maryland. Proposals have been debated in the Maryland General Assembly in 1833-1835, 1852 and recently in 1998 for the Eastern Shore becoming its own state. Because of its unique location, Maryland's different regions portray different regional characteristics. \nFor tourists coming from the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South (United States of America)"],["South"]]},", be aware that many, if not most, residents of the Eastern Shore consider themselves Southerners. Maryland was a border state during the Civil War. By 1860 49.1% of the African Americans in the state were free. Some may jump to the conclusion that Shoremen are racist because they consider themselves southerners and live in an isolated area. This is not true and is generally not true for any other southern country area either.\n",{"type":"===","value":["Geography"]},"\nThe Eastern Shore is part of the Delmarva Peninsula. The topography of the Eastern Shore is flat. Mountains are non-existent and hills are rare. Because of its proximity to the Chesapeake, the Eastern Shore has several islands, marshes, beaches, and inlets.\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nIts location on the Atlantic Coastal Plain in Maryland gives the Eastern Shore a humid subtropical climate, with hot, humid summers and cold and rainy winters that sometimes come with snowstorms. For botanists, the USDA hardiness rating is a 7B-8.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nThe Eastern Shore, because of its proximity to Virginia and historic isolation from the Western Shore, maintains a Southern accent akin to the Tidewater region of Virginia. This is especially true of the four counties on the \"Lower Shore\" or counties nearest Virginia: Wicomico, Dorchester, Somerset, and Worcester.

While SBY is not actually a \"big\" airport it is still included on this list because it is the only \"somewhat big\" airport on the Eastern Shore of Maryland.
