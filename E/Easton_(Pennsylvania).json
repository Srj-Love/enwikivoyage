Every year, Easton celebrates this historic event with its Heritage Day celebration, held in July.\n\nEaston became a primary commercial location during the canals and railroads era of the 1800s. The Delaware, Morris and Lehigh canals were vital for transportation of goods. The railroads replaced the canals for transportation and five railroads served Easton. The city had a strong German heritage.

Severe cold snaps are common, with highs dropping into the twenties. Heavy snowfalls rarely occur more than once or twice each winter, but a wintry mix of ice, sleet, and light snow is possible from mid-November through early April. The combination of above freezing daytime temps and below freezing nights makes black ice a constant wintertime driving hazard even when there has not been precipitation recently.\n\nLate spring and early summer (from mid-April to late June), and autumn are the most pleasant times of the year, with very mild temperatures and generally low humidity.
