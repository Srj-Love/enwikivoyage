U.S. Sacagawea dollar coins are also widely used, more so than in the U.S. Susan B. Anthony dollars, however, are not generally accepted.\n\nMany merchants examine large bills ($10 and above) carefully to make sure they aren't counterfeit. Frequently, businesses will not accept fifty dollar bills or hundred dollar bills at all. One must usually go to a bank in order to break hundred dollar bills. Outside of tourist areas and Quito, many merchants do not keep large amounts of money on hand, so getting change for bills large and small may be difficult.  This is especially true on cheaper buses. Take lots of one and five dollar bills with you; you will also want to bring the newest possible bills.  Worn bills are often regarded with suspicion, and it is not uncommon for a merchant to ask you to pay with another bill if the one you handed them appears old or worn.\n\nTravelers' checks can be exchanged at some (but not all) banks for a reasonable fee (usually not more than 3 percent). They are also accepted at some hotels that cater to tourists, although it is difficult to use them elsewhere.  There is often a surcharge added to use traveler's checks.\n\nCredit and debit cards are accepted at many places that cater to tourists as well as at some upscale shops.

TIP: Banco Austro is the only national bank chain that doesn't charge a withdrawal fee. The others have learned a cue from the States, and typically charge $1 or more per transaction. Avoid using ATMs on the street as their users are frequently targeted by street thieves.  Hotels or other places with a guard nearby are your best choices.\n\nPrices vary widely in Ecuador. Costs at upscale hotels and restaurants seem to be close, maybe 10 percent less, to what they would be in the United States. Outside of tourist areas, costs are much less. It is possible to get a meal at a clean restaurant for under $2 or to pay less than $10 for a clean but basic hotel room.\n\nEven though Ecuador is a very beautiful country, it does not know how to sell itself very well. In Quito, a very famous touristic site is El Mercado Artesenal where many souvenirs can be found but after a thorough look around you will realize that there is a bit of redundancy in the items in the sense that everyone is basically selling the same thing. Therefore, after buying a few main items it becomes difficult to find much more variety. Almost everything that can be bought has a price that can be bargained.

Especially in the Coastline, Ecuadorians make a variety of breakfast meals based on green or sweet plantain and yuca, such as bolonoes, empanadas, patacones, corviches, muchines, pan de yuca, humitas and others.

Often, the hostels in smaller towns are actually privately owned homes that welcome travellers. As with most things, natives can help you find an excellent hotel at a very low price ($6-14).

Of the most significant are foodborne illnesses, though they can easily be treated with digestive drugs such as antacids or antidiarrheals.\n\nBottled water is key in Ecuador if you don't want to get sick. This doesn't only apply to foreigners who don't have the stomach for Ecuadorian food but also Ecuadorians who know that if they don't boil their water or drink it from the bottle that they can get very sick.  As a result, it can be purchased almost everywhere (even in the most remote places) for well under $.25-.50. Water bottles are sometimes provided by hostels and hotels, which can be used for brushing teeth.\n\nIt is advisable to receive a typhoid vaccination, and possibly a yellow fever vaccination, depending on your specific area of travel.\n\nOutside the major cities and tourist areas, malaria can be a problem along the coast during the rainy season.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Respect"]},"\nThe common greetings are \"Buenos días\", \"Buenas tardes\" or \"Buenas noches\", (Good morning, Good afternoon, and Good evening, respectively). It is usually complemented by a handshake, between men, and by a kiss on the cheek between women or between a man and a woman. \"Hola\" is the most common greeting between friends and acquaintances. Note that, as in most Latin American countries, it's considered normal and polite to stand quite close to the other person while talking.\n\nIf you speak Spanish with Ecuadorians commoners, take note of the difference between the two forms for the pronoun \"you\": the informal \"tú\" and the formal \"usted\". It's customary to address older people and people with whom you're not familiar with \"usted\". Ecuadorans are generally forgiving of non-native speakers, but use \"usted\" when in doubt. \n\nAmong many other cultural idiosyncrasies, in the Sierra regions it is considered impolite to use a downward-facing palm as a reference for the height of a person. Instead, the hand is held on its side, and the measurement taken from the lower edge to the floor. Gesturing with the palm down is appropriate for animals only.\n\nWhen motioning for someone to \"come here,\" it is impolite to motion your hand with the palm facing up.

For calls within Ecuador, it is possible to use a telephone cabin. This is an entire storefront filled with telephones.  Generally, you are assigned a booth by the proprietor, you make your call, then you pay as you leave.  Calls within Ecuador are more expensive than domestic calls in most countries, but not unreasonable, except for calls to cell phones, which generate most of their revenue by charging the caller.  Also, call prices increase depending on the distance of your call within Ecuador, based on city, province, etc.  Visitors making an extended stay should consider purchasing a cell phone. Most are sold on a prepaid-call basis, and phone refill cards can be purchased in all but the smallest towns. It is also possible to get a modern GSM cellular phone \"unlocked\" so that it will function in Ecuador (you can take your own phone, if it compatible with GSM 850MHz), however, this should be reserved for emergencies as the cost of actually making such a call is usually exorbitant (about $0,45 per minute).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Radio and television"]},"\nRadio and\/or television is available in Spanish except in some of the particularly remote areas.
