Summer, the main festival season, combines long daylight hours with lengthy evenings (being so far north, it rarely gets dark before 10 or 11 at night!).

The bus leaves from Waverley Bridge (opposite entrance to train station) for the Airport at the same intervals 24\/7. Adult fares are £4.00 for a single, £7.00 for an open return and the journey takes an average 25 mins. The buses offer free wi-fi connection, sockets for charging electrical equipment, CCTV allowing top-deck passengers to monitor their luggage, and electronic \"next-stop\" information. The Airlink buses have a dedicated blue livery which makes them easy to distinguish from the rest of the Lothian fleet. The Airlink bus is less frequent between midnight and 04.30, is supplemented by the N22 route which runs every 30 minutes, but takes a slightly different route into town, costing £3.00 single.\n\nA cheaper alternative is the ordinary Lothian Buses service 35 ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/lothianbuses.com\/find-your-bus\/timetables\/819-service-35.html"]},", which runs from the bus stance outside the arrivals building to Ocean Terminal via the Royal Mile\/High Street. Although much slower (about 1h30) and with less provision for baggage than the 100, it is far cheaper at £1.50 a single and also allows the use of day tickets (£3.50) and other options that work on all Lothian Buses services, a great option for getting straight to the city if travelling lightly or on a budget.\n\nSince 31 May 2014 the new ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.edinburghtrams.com\/ tram"]}," links the airport with the city centre, passing Edinburgh Park railway station. It is likely that bus services for the airport will be changed as a result during summer 2014. A single ticket costs £5.00 (valid for all stops including the Airport and you have to board the tram within 30 min after the purchase) and a return ticket £8.00 (the return journey can be on any day). If you plan to do some additional trips on the same day, you can also buy a day ticket for £9.00 which gives you unlimited travel between all tram stops and the Lothian Buses (day services) for one day.

It lies between the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Edinburgh\/Old Town"],["Old"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Edinburgh\/New Town"],["New"]]}," Towns, adjacent to Princes Street, Edinburgh Castle and the Princes Street Gardens, where it serves over 14 million people per annum. Despite various refurbishments, the past still survives in the station's elaborate, domed ceiling where wreathed cherubs leap amid a wealth of scrolled ironwork.\n\nWaverley Station is a major hub for the Scottish rail network, operated by First Scotrail ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.firstscotrail.co.uk\/"]},". There is an hourly service to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dundee"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Aberdeen"]]},", and two hourly to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Inverness"]]},". Shuttle trains to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Glasgow"]]}," (Queen Street) run every 15 minutes throughout the day, dropping to 30 minutes on evenings and Sundays, and the journey takes 45–50 minutes. There are also services which operate via Bathgate and Airdrie to Glasgow Queen Street Low Level at a 15 minute interval. Stopping patterns differ on this route, meaning that every half hour, the service takes approx. 1 hour whereas every other half hour services take around 1 hour 15 minutes to complete the journey. Some services run to Glasgow Central instead, but run via Lanarkshire with many more stops.  Certain CrossCountry trains originating from Birmingham and the south west also continue to Glasgow Central - again your ticket will be valid on these services but the journey will take slightly longer than the shuttle.\n\nThe vast majority of train services to Edinburgh from London (and most of eastern England) are operated by East Coast (which replaced National Express on 14 November 2009) ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.eastcoast.co.uk\/"]},"; an hourly service leaves from London Kings Cross station throughout the day until 6PM. Journey time is between 4hrs 20min and 5 hours.  The cheapest tickets (£16 to £90) are advance single (one-way) fares for a fixed train time bought 2–12 weeks in advance, and the flexible Saver Ticket (roughly £100 single or return) is not valid at some times to\/from London.  Virgin Trains ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.virgintrains.co.uk"]}," operate a 2 hourly service from Birmingham New Street via the West Coast Mainline with an average journey time of 4hrs 4 mins.\n\nFor a different travel experience from London, try the Caledonian Sleeper service ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.firstgroup.com\/scotrail\/content\/caledoniansleeper\/"]},", which runs every night from London's Euston Station except Saturdays, and the journey takes approximately 8 hours. Bear in mind that if you are travelling alone you may have to share the sleeping compartment with a stranger of the same sex. Tickets can be booked in the usual manner at any main line railway station in Britain, and the cost of a return journey to Edinburgh from London varies from around £100 for two one-way \"Advance\" tickets rising to the full open return fare of £165. You can also travel for around £23 one-way in a seated carriage or £95 return (full fare). BritRail passes can be used to reserve tickets on the sleeper trains.\n\nHowever, heavily discounted one-way tickets on the Caledonian Sleeper known as \"Bargain Berths\" are available for £19, £29, £39 or £49 depending on how early you book, but, confusingly, these cannot be bought from a railway station in the normal way but only from the First ScotRail website, and you will be emailed an e-ticket (similar to an airline), which you must print out and show to the conductor at the platform before getting on the train.\n\nTrains to other English cities are operated by Arriva Cross Country (services via York, Birmingham and central England to the south coast and West Country) and Trans-Pennine Express (services to Manchester via Carlisle) from Waverley.\n\nThe \"charged by the piece\" left luggage service at Waverley railway station is much more expensive (£7 per item for 0–24 hours!) than the lockers a few blocks away at the Edinburgh bus station on St. Andrew's Square.\n\nThere is a second railway station in the centre of Edinburgh, Haymarket,  around a mile to the west of Waverley. If you are arriving from the north, west or southwest, Haymarket is a better station to exit at if you are heading straight for the airport, zoo, or modern art gallery or if your accommodation is on the west side of town as you will avoid the city centre traffic, and it is on the major westbound bus routes.\n\nBoth Waverley and Haymarket stations had ticket barriers installed in 2004 so you will need to purchase a ticket in order to enter or leave the platform area. If you get on a train at an unmanned station, you can purchase a ticket from the conductor on the train or a ticket inspector near the barrier gates: note that there is usually a long queue during the peak rush hour period. The barrier gates will retain single journey tickets so be sure to get a receipt if you need one. If you have the larger kind of ticket that does not fit in the barrier, you will need to go to the gate manned by a member of staff who will check your ticket and let you through. If you do not have a ticket, you will need to go to the ticket office behind the barrier (platform 14 at Waverley) to buy one.\n\nEdinburgh Park is a new train station that opened in 2004, which is some way from the city centre, serves business parks and \"The Gyle\" shopping centre. As of December 2010, direct trains to and from Glasgow Queen Street Low Level began to serve Edinburgh Park, on the Airdrie-Bathgate route (or A2B) operating on a 15 minute interval. There services will take around an hour to get to Glasgow from Edinburgh Park.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By road"]},"\nBy road, Edinburgh can be reached most immediately by the M8 motorway (from Glasgow and the west), M9 (from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Stirling"]]}," and the north-west), A90\/M90 (from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Perth (Scotland)"],["Perth"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dundee"]]}," and northern Scotland), the A1 (from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Newcastle upon Tyne"]]}," and north-east England) and A702\/M74 (from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Carlisle"]]}," and north-western England).\n\nFrom ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]}," the fastest route to Edinburgh is the M1 motorway, followed by the A1(M) and the A1 - a journey of 640 km (398 mi) and approximately 8-9 hrs driving time.\n\nEdinburgh is not a particularly car friendly city (the worst city to drive in outside of London in the UK) with the myriad of one-way streets and the Old Town's medieval layout, and the dedication of parking wardens to ticketing anything that is not moving is legendary. Finding parking can be difficult, though there are several multi-storey car parks in the city centre (Castle Terrace for the West End, try St James Centre or Greenside at the East End). If visiting for the day, it is often cheaper and quicker to use the new Park and Ride systems now in place on all approaches to the City, (National Park and Ride Directory is available online ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.parkandride.net\/edinburgh\/edinburgh_frameset.shtml "]},"), so it's even easy to just abandon your car on the outskirts.

Between Haymarket station and the airport the tram runs on an off road track, but runs on the road between Haymarket and St Andrew's Square. This was due to be finished by 2012, but disputes with the main construction contractor and delays in construction mean that the first passenger carrying trams ran 31 May 2014, with the project massively overbudget as a result. The combination of these things means the tram project has received almost universal scorn from locals. However, as it links the airport, rugby stadium, both main train stations and Princes Street it may be helpful for some visitors to the city. However buses are likely to remain the main and most practical method of public transport in Edinburgh for the foreseeable future.\n\nA single journey (not stopping at the airport) costs £1.50. Day tickets cost £3.50 and can also be used (or purchased) on Lothian Buses. A single to or from the airport costs £5.00.

If you're planning a visit during festival time (Aug), around Christmas and New Year, or on the weekend of a Scotland home game in the 6-nations Rugby ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.rbs6nations.com\/"]}," (Mar\/Apr, 2 or 3 matches per year), then you will find that all types of accommodation get booked up well in advance, and a premium may be applied to the room-rate. It's not impossible to get somewhere to stay at short notice at these times, but you won't be able to be fussy and it will probably be expensive.  Note however that the average cost of hotel accommodation in Edinburgh is higher than anywhere else in Scotland.\n\nFor those on a budget, there are cheap youth hostels available with prices from £10 and above. The private\/independent hostels centre around the Cowgate area, the lower Royal Mile and its side streets. The hostels of the HI affiliated Scottish Youth Hostel Association ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.syha.org.uk"]}," can be booked on-line and are an especially good deal during summer, when the SYHA rents student accommodation as summer hostels: Single rooms in the city centre for a very modest price.\n\nThere are Guest Houses and small hotels dotted around almost every part of the city, however there are high concentrations in 2 areas, namely around Newington Road and Minto Street on the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Edinburgh\/South"],["South"]]}," side, and on Pilrig Street and Newhaven Road in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Edinburgh\/Leith"],["Leith"]]},". Both areas are within a brisk 15-20 minute walk of the city centre and both have excellent round-the-clock bus services. If arriving in town without having booked accommodation, it may be worth heading for one or other of these areas and looking out for the \"Vacancies\" signs, though probably not during the festival or around Hogmanay.\n\nSome of the Guest Houses and even hotels can be booked for as little as the hostels at certain times of year, while more upmarket accommodation ranges from boutique B&B's, with just a few rooms, lovingly run by a family, to world-renowned large 5-star hotels.\n\nAnother good alternative for accommodation is self-catering holiday apartments. Edinburgh has a wide offer of short term holiday apartments steps away from its main tourist attractions. It is a great opportunity to experience the city as a local. Apartments can be booked on-line. For summer months, especially August, it is highly recommended to book well in advance as most tourists tend to make their bookings in February for this period.\n\nDue to the excellent and frequent rail links between the two cities, savvy travellers can cut the costs by basing themselves in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Glasgow"]]},", where deals in mainstream chain hotels are easier to come by - and you get the advantage of being able to \"do\" both cities - bear in mind of course when your last train leaves!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Internet"]},"\nMultiple internet cafés and hotspot venues exist throughout Edinburgh (see ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Edinburgh#Districts"],["district"]]}," articles for details).\n",{"type":"*","value":["Free WiFi is available in many places across the city such as coffee shops, department stores, larger high street shops and supermarkets."]},{"type":"*","value":["Many of the municipal libraries ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.edinburgh.gov.uk\/internet\/leisure\/Libraries"]}," throughout the city have PCs with free internet access.
