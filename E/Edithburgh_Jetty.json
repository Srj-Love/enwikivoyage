The site is highly regarded as a venue for both night diving and underwater photography.\n\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Position"]},"\nS35.084776, E137.748636\n\n\n\nThe jetty connects to the east end of Edith Street, Edithburgh.  \n\nThis site is within a marine protected area, the Lower Yorke Peninsula Marine Park, but it is not subject to any controls apart from fisheries regulations in respect to the collection of marine life. \n\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Name"]},"\nThe site name \"Edithburgh Jetty\" is derived from the name of the jetty. The official name of the point to which the jetty is connected is De Mole Point. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Depth"]},"\nMaximum depth is about 8 m, depending on the tide and the seabed immediately below the entry steps is about 2 m.  The average depth under the jetty is likely to be about 5m.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Visibility"]}," \nVisibility is generally better than 10m, i.e. one can clearly see from one side of the jetty to the other.  However, visibility can be very poor, i.e. less than 5m, when the wind is blowing from the east.\n",{"type":"===","value":["Topography"]},"\n\nThe jetty extends in an easterly direction for about 170m from the end of Edith Street.  Its width starts at about 7.5m and widens to about 11m at about 75m from the shore.  The seabed under the jetty falls from about 2 m depth at the entry point to about 6m at the west end.   The seabed under the jetty is white sand littered with discarded structure left over from periodic maintenance and other rubbish.  All of these materials are largely covered with invertebrate animal life such as sponges and ascidians.\nOn the north side of the jetty, the seabed has been dredged to a depth of at least 8m for the length of the wider section of jetty to permit large vessels to moor alongside the jetty.  \nTo the west of the end of the jetty, there is rock strata that has exposed by the dredging process as well as the remains of jetty piles from a time when the jetty was longer. The seabed around the jetty is covered with either seagrass or other marine plants.\n\n\n\n\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Conditions"]},"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Facilities"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Parking:"]}," Vehicles can be parked on the portion of Edith Street immediately adjoining the jetty as well as the raised parking areas that overlook the jetty and that are accessible from Oâ€™Halloran Parade, the street running parallel to the coastline.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Ablutions:"]}," A small toilet block with an external freshwater tap (great for rinsing cameras et al) is located on the shore immediately adjoining the north side of the jetty.

There are also two hotels on opposite corners of the intersection of Blanche and Edith Streets- the Edithburgh Hotel and the Troubridge Hotel.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Air fills:"]}," these can be obtained from Edithburgh Motors at 55 Blanche Street (i.e. the corner of Blanche and Thomas Streets).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nAccess is via the two stairs on opposite sides of the jetty located at about 30m from the start of the jetty.  It is important to mention that direct exit to the shore is relatively difficult as the jetty starts from a cliff face of about 3m in height.  Alternative exit points include a ladder at the east end of the jetty and the shore adjoining the Edithburgh Tidal Pool (refer above).\n  \n\n \n\n\nAccess is considered to be good as both stairs lead down to ramps that extend into the water.

However, a compass can be useful for finding the way back to the shore, i.e. swim west. A torch is useful during daylight hours to illuminate the invertebrate animal life under the shade of the jetty's deck to reveal the actual colours.
