In 1795, Edmonton House was constructed and work on Fort Edmonton began.  The original site was near Fort Saskatchewan, but was relocated near the present day Legislature in 1830.\n\nThe town developed around the fur trade, and in the early days there was little to distinguish it from other such settlements in the area. The first hotel and hospital were built in the 1870s.  The latter part of the century saw an influx of wealthy families, and in 1892 the Town of Edmonton was officially founded. \n\nEarly developments were centered around the Quarters area. In 1905, Edmonton was declared the capital of the province of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alberta"]]},", and a year later  was designated a city.  The 1907-1914 period saw the city experience an unprecedented boom, with the population rising from around 6,000 to 78,000. During this period, the University of Alberta was founded \n\nIn 1947 oil was discovered just outside of Edmonton in Leduc county, which spurred a second period of growth, leading to urban sprawl and the development of US-style malls. The Royal Alberta Museum opened in 1967.\n\nThe utilitarian office buildings and condos that dominate the downtown landscape today were mostly constructed in the 1970s. \n\nToday, Edmonton is the hub for energy development & petrochemicals for Alberta.  As well, it has become a centre of excellence in research through the University of Alberta and the high technology industries located in the region like the National Institute for Nanotechnology.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh = -7.3"],["febhigh = -3.6"],["marhigh = 2.1"],["aprhigh = 11.3"],["mayhigh = 17.6"],["junhigh = 21"],["julhigh = 22.8"],["aughigh = 22.1"],["sephigh = 16.8"],["octhigh = 10.9"],["novhigh = 0"],["dechigh = -5.4"],["janlow = -16"],["feblow = -13.1"],["marlow = -7.3"],["aprlow = -0.3"],["maylow = 5.7"],["junlow = 10"],["jullow = 12.1"],["auglow = 11.1"],["seplow = 5.8"],["octlow = 0.3"],["novlow = -8.2"],["declow = -13.9"],["janprecip = 23"],["febprecip = 15"],["marprecip = 17"],["aprprecip = 26"],["mayprecip = 49"],["junprecip = 87"],["julprecip = 92"],["augprecip = 69"],["sepprecip = 44"],["octprecip = 18"],["novprecip = 18"],["decprecip = 21"],["description = See the Edmonton 7 day forecast at ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.weatheroffice.gc.ca\/city\/pages\/ab-50_metric_e.html Environment Canada"]}]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Downtown-Skyline-Edmonton-Alberta-Canada-02-2.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["325px"],["Edmonton skyline in winter."]]},"\n\nIf you want to spend time outdoors, the summer months offer the most opportunities for recreation and entertainment. In the summer, Edmonton offers great outdoor festivals, street entertainment, open-air concerts, and many other world-class entertainment opportunities. Winter is equally exciting, with snow sports for the outdoorsy, extensive indoors shopping in the many malls, and live sports, theater, and music throughout the city.\n\nEdmonton's climate is \"northern continental\", with a wide range of weather over all four distinct seasons. Edmonton receives 2,300 hours of sunshine per year, making it one of Canada's sunniest cities. Rainfall is low to moderate, and entire weeks can pass without clouds or precipitation through the late spring and summer.\n\nBright green foliage appears in May, signaling spring. Even as the city shakes off its winter chill, cold snaps and the occasional snowfall can still occur. The region's golf courses are generally open by this time.\n\nSummer days generally bring temperatures up to 21-25°C (70-77°F) in June, July, and August, though temperatures will often rise over 30°C (85°F) for a few days. Thunderstorms sweep in from time to time during the summer months, usually in the evening. Humidity is relatively low, so warm days are more comfortable than they are in humid climates. At the height of summer, Edmonton enjoys more than 17 hours of daylight, with twilight extending past 11PM in June and July.\n\nFall starts in mid September, bringing bright yellow and orange foliage to Edmonton's treed neighborhoods and river valley parks. This season ushers in cooler temperatures ranging between 10-20°C during the day. \n\nWinters are long, but not as harsh as those further east on the Canadian Prairies. Periods of mild temperatures with daytime highs over 0°C (32°F) can occur. Such mild weather makes outdoor winter sports extremely popular with the locals. Stop by a local outdoor ice rink to catch the fever of children and adults alike taking part in community hockey. Colder days in Edmonton are kept reasonably comfortable by the low humidity index, but it's wise to have some lip balm and hand cream with you, as the skin and lips can get cracked and chapped quickly in this dry environment. \n\nWinter walking and driving are not often affected. Cold snaps with temperatures down to and beyond -30°C (-22F) can occur during the winter, although it's unusual for these frigid spells to last more than 1 or 2 days. Extremely cold temperatures are usually accompanied by the crisp blue skies and bright sunshine of a prairie high-pressure zone. Even regular winter temperatures can feel very cold if there is a noticeable wind: if you are visiting between December and March, be prepared.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Tourist Centres"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Downtown Business Association of Edmonton"],["url=http:\/\/www.edmontondowntown.com"],["email=info@edmontondowntown.com"],["address=10121 Jasper Avenue"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Located on the west side of the Royal Bank building"],["phone = +1 780-424-4085"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=8:30AM-5PM M-F, closed weekends and statutory holidays"],["price="],["content=Every year, the Downtown Business Association publishes Guide to Downtown - a free, pocket-sized resource for everything happening downtown all year round.

Road conditions are regularly announced on radio if poor weather threatens travel, so check before you leave and every couple of hours on any long drive near Edmonton. \n\nThe two words to watch out for in a winter weather report are \"fair\" and \"poor\". Fair winter driving conditions suggest snow tires, lots of windshield washer fluid, full winter outdoor clothes in case you have to leave the car, and preferably winter driving experience. Poor conditions are the code for \"stay home\". Fortunately, poor conditions rarely last more than one day on major highways, where road clearing takes place continuously. Travelers familiar with winter driving will find the major highways connected to Edmonton generally safe, but should stick to the biggest highway possible as the smaller ones are not as frequently traveled nor as quickly cleared.\n\nFrom Vancouver, Edmonton is best accessed using Highway 1 (the Trans-Canada) east to Hope, then Highway 5 (the Coquihalla) from Hope to the Highway 16 eastbound junction. The average travel time in reasonable weather is 12 to 14 hours, but can be significantly longer if poor winter weather strikes. This is particularly likely on the major inclines between Hope and Kamloops in British Columbia, where poor road conditions can add a few hours to the total trip. Further along the Yellowhead Highway toward Edmonton, communities near the highway are sparse, so judge the driving conditions (and your fuel status) carefully as you proceed.\n\nThe QE II highway from Calgary northward to Edmonton is a very busy thoroughfare in all seasons, and a generally reliable road in winter. It's occasionally closed if winter storms create dangerous road conditions. Fortunately there are many communities near or on the highway where one can shelter if necessary.\n\nTravelers from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saskatoon"]]}," will find Edmonton about 5 hours away using the Yellowhead Highway, which is divided for the entire route between the two cities.

For example, 10219-101 Street would be located on the east side of 101 Street, just north of 102 Avenue.\n\nThe vast majority of the city lies in the NW quadrant with the center-point near the southeast corner of the city proper. It is common to omit the \"NW\" from street addresses in the NW quadrant. The grid's official \"zeros\" are called Meridian Street (at 0 Street) and Quadrant Avenue (at 0 Avenue), but they are not yet important streets for travel. Meridian & Quadrant do not even intersect at this time.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Knox Church Edmonton Alberta Canada 03 A.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["200px"],["The historic Knox church in Old Strathcona"]]},"\n\nA young city, Edmonton's historic structures are still relatively new.
