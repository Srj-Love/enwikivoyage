[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.efteling.com\/ Efteling"]}]}," is a theme park in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Brabant"]]}," in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Netherlands"]]},". It's themed around fairy tales and is the largest theme park in the Benelux. It's said that it can measure itself with Tivoli Gardens in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Copenhagen"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Disneyland Paris"]]},".\n\nAlthough very suited to families with children, it is not childish: Efteling provides more that enough to do for any age category for at least an entire day.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nOriginally Efteling catered towards children with a fairy tale theme, nowadays Efteling appeals to young and old with its cultural, romantic and nostalgic theme and its variety of amusement rides. In over fifty years, Efteling has evolved from a general nature park with playground and unique Fairy Tale Forest, into a full-size theme park along the lines of Disneyland.\n\nEfteling is famous for its great attention to detail, the green atmosphere and excellent dark rides. With four million visitors annually, it's in the top of European theme parks right after the Disney parks in France and Europa Park in Germany.\n\nThe base for the park as it is now was created in 1950. Artist Anton Pieck and inventor Peter Reijnders set out to create a quality fairy tale forest. Pieck's remarkable, nostalgic style combined with Reijnders' ingenuity and the use of \"real\" materials created an enchanting forest that immediately profiled Efteling as a national attraction upon its opening in 1952. The style set by Pieck has been the base for many developments after that, setting the park apart.\n\nThe most important milestones in its development :\n",{"type":"*","value":[" 1933: A catholic complex of sporting facilities is founded."]},{"type":"*","value":[" 1952: The park opens its Fairy Tale Forest, which instantly becomes a tourist hit; this is considered the start of the current Efteling."]},{"type":"*","value":[" 1978: The Haunted Castle is the first \"large scale\" attraction."]},{"type":"*","value":[" 1980: Efteling starts to build thrill-rides (rollercoasters and the like) to appeal to a larger audience."]},{"type":"*","value":[" 1987: Efteling returns to its roots with building large attractions but always themed around the (broad) fairy tales and myths theme; continues until today."]},{"type":"*","value":[" 1999: Start of Winter Efteling.

The park opens at 10 am (march-November) or 11 am (November-march). Closing time was 21:00 in July and August, but has been 20:00 since 2011 for unclear reasons. Closing time in July\/August is 24:00 on Saturdays. 18:00 is the closing time in the rest of the year, with exceptions in some winter weekends and Christmas Holiday: 20:00. There's also a Winter Efteling that opens between November and march, see the web site for exact details.\n\nEfteling is reachable in the following ways:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" By car: the park has good parking space for around €10 per day. The park is signposted from the nearby highways."]},{"type":"*","value":[" By train: special buses depart from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Den Bosch"],["'s Hertogenbosch"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tilburg"]]}," railway stations at least hourly in the mornings.

The surroundings are nice green routes, a bike ride to Efteling is recommended if you're staying in the neighbourhood!"]},"\nThe entrance fee is €32 off-season and €34 in the summer (2011). Discounts are available for tickets bought through their website or at resellers like all Albert Heijn supermarkets. Such prepaid tickets can save you a queue at the entrance on busy days. There's also a combination train+bus+entrance ticket, which is a good deal, but this can only be ordered from the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ns.nl\/efteling NS website"]}," in advance. Children 0-2 are free of charge.\n\nOnce inside, all attractions and shows are free (except for the Game Gallery).\n\nDogs are not allowed in but there's a kennel at the entrance building.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nOnce inside the park, everything can be done on foot. It's about 65 ha big, that's around 20% larger than Disneyland Paris. Wheelchairs are available for free, and carts to take kids around kan be rented for €3.\n\nThe park is divided into four realms: Fairy Realm (Marerijk), Travel Realm (Reizenrijk), Rough Realm (Ruigrijk) and Alternative Realm (Anderrijk).\n\nThere's a (real) Steam Train that services one station in the Marerijk and one in the Ruigrijk and provides a scenic tour around the park.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nA division between see and do is not entirely clear for a theme park, but attractions will be considered under ",{"type":"''","value":["do"]},".\n\nThe park itself is set in a real forest, and that shows: there's a lot of green to see, and the small army of gardeners bring in large quantities of flowers each season. There's also a collection of tame animals like peacocks, ducks, geese and other birds.\n\nAlso to see are the shows and wandering entertainment. During the summer there's a free show in the Efteling Theatre multiple times a day. Besides that, the park features lots of smaller shows which change by the season, and wandering theatrical entertainment. For an up-to-date list, be sure to catch the information leaflet when entering.\n\nA remarkable figure around the park is Holle Bolle Gijs (see image below), a sturdy character similar to Humpty Dumpty, that is insatisfiable in his hunger for paper. He keeps on asking \"Paper Here\", and thanks visitors that feed him their waste.\n\nWhen the park has reduced opening in the winter time, a yearly changing large-scale musical production is set in the Efteling Theatre.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nBelow are the most important attractions in the park; either because of popularity or because of notability.

When a coin is inserted, they shortly come to life and produce some kind of small toy – it's a surprise what it will be.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Eft HolleBolleGijs 02.jpg"],["thumb"],["Holle Bolle Gijs on the lookout for more paper to eat"]]},"\n\nUnfortunately, exquisite food is not Efteling's strong point. The park excels in snack food though, with lots of places to buy fries or pizza. Try the typical Dutch fries with Mayonnaise at the Smulpaap in Marerijk. Also available are the Dutch \"snack wall\" vending machines that give you a warm snack when money is inserted.\n\nApart from snacks, there's two self-service restaurants: Witte Paard (white horse) in Marerijk and De Ballonvaarder in Reizenrijk. Next to the latter is also a waited restaurant Welkom, and one in the theatre near the entrance. There serve relatively simple dishes and special children's menus.\n\nRecommended is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Het Poffertje"]}," across the Caroussel palace.
