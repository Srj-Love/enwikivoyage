In crop year 2000, Butterhofs Shady Brook Farm decided it was time for local youth to have an opportunity to visit a traditional farm and gain hands-on experience at all levels of running a family farm operation. A wealth of historical perspective can be relayed to students, since the Butterhof's are a fourth-generation farm family. In operation since 1854, Butterhof's Farm is located in the nation's first National Reserve, the Pinelands, which encompasses almost 1.1 million acres. Students have the opportunity to take a hayride through 60 acres of cropland, where they see and learn what it takes to grow and harvest fruits vegetables and field crops. Students can participate in the seasonal pick-your-own programs, where they learn the agronomic practices necessary to produce strawberries, tomatoes, peppers, flowers and pumpkins. Finally, students can test their skills as they traverse through a three-acre corn maze and participate in an agricultural scavenger hunt. At the end of the session, students, teachers and chaperones can use the on-site picnic facilities."]]}]}," \n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Moravian Church of Egg Harbor City"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/moravianchurchehc.com\/default.asp"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Est. 1859.
