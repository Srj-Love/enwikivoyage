The first capital of the Bishopric was Säben near Klausen (during Roman times known as ",{"type":"''","value":["Sabione"]}," - Klausen was ",{"type":"''","value":["Subsabione"]},"). In 901 Brixen was founded and in 980 it became the bishopric centre. Since then Brixen has been the religious capital of Tyrol. The diocese was founded in the 6th century, and gradually received more secular powers. The Bishopric of Brixen was elevated to an immediate principality of the Holy Roman Empire in 1179, and lost its worldly powers in 1803, when its territory was annexed by Austria. The Bishopric of Brixen existed until 1964, when it became part of the Diocese of Bolzano-Brixen.
