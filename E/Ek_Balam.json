Ek' B'alam means Black Jaguar or Star Jaguar in the Yucatec Maya language, but inscriptions indicate that the original name of the site was probably Talol.  Rare and original stucco sculptures are protected by modern thatched roofs on the remains of the Acropolis.  Such stucco sculptures generally do not survive because they are just plaster and weather rapidly.  As Chichen Itza became more powerful, eclipsing Ek Balam, the Maya themselves buried the Acropolis at Ek Balam, preserving the stucco sculptures and many painted hieroglyphic inscriptions.  This gives us an illustration of what many other Maya sites must once have looked like.\n\nThere is no museum on site. The small visitors' center charges for entry and has restrooms.  Hotels and restaurants can be found in any nearby town, including Mérida and Valladolid. This site is becoming more popular with tourists, but is still (July 2007) much less visited than the much larger Chichen Itza. \n\nAn hour and a half is plenty of time to see the site, unless you are an archaeologist. Ek Balam can easily be combined with visits to other sites. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nHot, humid, often with blazing sun.

It is close to Mérida, Valladolid, and Chichen Itzá.  The usual blue and white tourist signs indicate the direction on the highway (these signs are few and far between, and as of July 2007, were accurate).\n\nThere are no buses that go to Ek Balam, you need to take a car, taxi, or collectivo taxi.  Collectivos are vans that take multiple people to the same place, and are cheaper than taking a private taxi for just your group.  You can find them in Valladolid.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\nAdmission fee is 58 pesos (October 2010)\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nSee the cenote nearby.  There is a path by the main entrance that leads to it, and there are often people with rickshaws who will taxi you to it for a small fee.  Cenotes are freshwater sinkholes dozens of feet deep, and were considered sacred to the Mayans.  Ek Balam's cenote has stairs leading down to the water, a boardwalk around the edge of the water, a rope swing from the boardwalk and a kayak.  It's great for swimming on a hot day or just watching the catfish that live in the water.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nThe small town\/village of Ek Balam is near the site. The village has at least one restaurant (Italian).\n\nVery close to the site there is a small \"cafe\" dispensing cold drinks.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Lodging"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Camping"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Backcountry"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nIf you climb the ruins, be aware that the descent can be visually disorienting. Do not climb the Acropolis if you are subject to vertigo.\n\nThe area around the site seems quite safe. \n\nVendors near the site may direct you to park next to their shop and may pressure you to pay them to watch your car. If you do not desire their services, you may safely turn them down.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Valladolid (Mexico)"],["Valladolid"]]},", a small city, is about 15 minutes south of Ek Balam."]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Yucatán"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinepark"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Ek' Balam"]]}]
