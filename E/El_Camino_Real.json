The first missions were established by Junipero Serra, and later missions were established by Fermin Lasuen and others. The first mission was started in 1769, and the last was consecrated in 1823, only 27 years before California became a state.  Each was situated a day's journey on horseback along El Camino Real from the next mission.  Many of the mission buildings were built of adobe (sun-dried bricks of mud, clay, water and straw).  Though thick adobe mission walls provided relief from the warm California sun, they were susceptible to collapse during earthquakes.  A typical mission layout consisted of a courtyard bordered by the church, workshops, and living quarters for friars and neophytes.  Many of the missions had successful farming and ranching operations, and at one point one-sixth of California's land was mission-controlled. Though thousands of Indians were ostensibly converted to Catholicism, many others died of overwork or from diseases brought by the padres.

In the 20th century, following a new interest in California's Spanish heritage, the missions were restored, and a number of them still function to this day as Catholic churches. Thanks to the efforts of the Auto Club of Southern California and other booster organizations, El Camino Real was one of the first paved highways in California.  However, a number of unpaved relics of the old road exist parallel to the current highway, most notably at San Miguel and La Purisima.

There are a few exceptions to this, most notably Gaviota Pass and the area around Mission San Antonio, which is a good 30 miles from a city of significant size.

Rain in the summer is unlikely; rain in the winter could happen.\n\nIn order to have more time at the missions, it may be advantageous to eat your lunches from a cooler rather than stopping at a restaurant.  It is generally a good idea to eat breakfast before visiting the first mission of the day, and dinner after visiting the last one.\n\nThis itinerary may require driving at night.
