There are more and more plants, and after some hours you see several rivers, waterfalls, cattle and lamas.\nIt gets more humid and after one or two days you enter subtropical areas with high trees and a wide variety of plants.

Beneath Lamas, which belongs to the locals, there are barely any animals. Later, the pasture is accompanied by ferns and bushes. More and more plants encircle the trail as well as some flowers. The wood of conifers and others begins more or less close to Chucura and is more and more mixed with banana palms and subtropical plants as it goes down. Close to the end of the trail there are also coffee plants.\n\nThe most impressive animals you see are the butterflies and other insects and birds. There are a few mosquitos. One very famous bird of the Yungas region is the cock-of-the-rock (Rupicola peruvianus).\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Tunki Tanpupata.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Male Andean Cock-of-the-rock"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nThe first part is quite cold: Snow paves the way of the first hours all year round as it leads to the summit.\nAfter the summit you will descend through cloudy and foggy air until you find the first green valleys crossed by little rivers and some flowers. The first bushes and smaller trees are behind Samañapampa. The nights are cold here as it is still around 4,000 meters high. In general, huge parts of the trails' pavement are slippery and wet. Later, as you enter the zone with more vegetation after passing Chucura, parts of the trail are closely surrounded by wet plants.
