Founded as San Juan Bautista de Carapoa in 1564 by Spanish explorers, the city derives its present name from the fort constructed in 1610 to defend against attacks by the Zuaque and Tehueco tribes who resented the Spanish intrusion. El Fuerte soon became one of the most important staging and trading centers of northern Mexico, with its location near the head of the wide, verdant RÃ­o Fuerte valley assuring prosperity from agriculture. In 1824, it became the territorial capital of the vast area comprising what is now Sinaloa, Sonora, and part of southern Arizona. The architectural results of this history are evident today throughout the center of the city, from the central Plaza de Armas to the colonial mansions that extend for several blocks.     \n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Sinaloa"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["26.421494"],["-108.619992"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:El Fuerte, Sinaloa"]]}]
