It lies near the top of the city, rising out of the old medina. It used to be a site of a series of fortresses dating back to the 5th century BC. Currently, it displays Byzantine and Ottoman architecture. Admission is technically free, but a tip is expected by the gate keeper at the kasbah's entrance. The site's last military use was in the early 1950s, as a detention station for Habib Bourguiba, the first president of the Tunisian Republic.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nSmall cafes dot the city; they are often filled with local men.  \n\nAs for alcohol, there is only one licensed restaurant in El Kef.
