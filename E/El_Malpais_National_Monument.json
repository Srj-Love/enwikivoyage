The national monument protects 114,277 acres of volcanic landscape, while the adjacent national conservation area protects an additional 263,000 acres.  The area has been inhabited for over 10,000 years, and historic and archeological sites provide reminders of past times.  To this day Indian groups including the Acoma, Laguna, Zuni, and the Ramah Navajo still utilize the park for traditional activities including gathering herbs and medicines, paying respect, and renewing ties. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\nEl Malpais (pronounced ",{"type":"''","value":["el-mal-pie-EES"]},") means \"the badlands\", so named due to the volcanic features such as lava flows, cinder cones, pressure ridges and complex lava tube cave systems that dominate the landscape. Sandstone bluffs and mesas border the eastern side, providing access to vast wilderness.  Elevation in the park ranges from 6500 to 8300 ft.  The most recent lava flow emanated from McCarty's Crater within the last 2,000 to 3,000 years, so the park remains a geologically active area.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\nWhile known more for its geologic features than for its wildlife, the park is home to golden eagles, red-tailed hawks, prairie falcons, great-horned owls, black bears, mule deer, elk, coyotes, mountain lions and bobcats.  Less cuddly residents include rattlesnakes, scorpions, black widow spiders and brown recluse spiders.  The park was also the home of a transplanted bison herd from 1993 until 1995, but the herd's preference for roaming onto private lands led to their relocation. Some of the oldest douglas firs on earth live in the monument: one dead tree was dated at over 2,000 years old!\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nThe weather in northwestern New Mexico is unpredictable and visitors should be prepared for all conditions throughout the year.

Exit 85 at Grants will take you to the Northwest New Mexico Visitor Center, a multi-agency facility, located south of exit 85.

Since you're going to need to rent a car or SUV anyway if you fly, might as well get it in Albuquerque and drive, even if the commuter service resumes; it'll be quicker than flying into Gallup and driving back east.

In addition, be aware that the cave floors are uneven, littered with boulders, and often wet, making sturdy shoes a necessity.

Do not take these warnings lightly; if you lose your light source even a short distance from a cave entrance it is extremely likely that you will become disoriented in the darkness and unable to find your way out.  Similarly, the cave floor is rocky, uneven and often slippery, making sturdy footwear is an absolute necessity to avoid foot and ankle injuries.\n\nSturdy hiking boots are required when hiking on lava terrain and daypacks with water, snacks, raingear, first aid kit and sunscreen are suggested.  The heat while on lava flows can be intense, so plan on drinking at least one gallon of water per person per day.  In addition, be aware that progress over lava flows is slow, that lava is sharp and can easily tear apart tennis shoes, and that some sections of lava are unstable and may simply be thin crusts covering sinkholes. Traveling solo on the lava is a very bad idea, as a broken leg can spell certain doom. Cellular service is nonexistent beyond the very northern borders of the park. It is advisable to let someone know your itinerary in case you turn up missing. No joke, more than one person has been lost upon the veritable black sea. The dangers cannot be overstressed.\n\nLess common park dangers include rattlesnakes, scorpions and spiders, which can be easily avoided by being cautious in rocky areas; these creatures crawl under rocks to avoid the sun, so be cautious when reaching into crevices or overturning rocks.  In addition, the area around McCarty's crater was once used as a military bombing range, and while unlikely, it is possible that unexploded ordnance may be encountered if traveling in this remote location.  It goes without saying that any munitions that are encountered should not be handled and should be reported to rangers.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/elmo El Morro National Monument"]}]},".
