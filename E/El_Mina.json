But this is not correct; Mina is a city with a long and rich history and a municipality that dates back to the 19th century.\nThe Greeks first inhabited the city and then the Turkish and of course the Syrians.\nThe people of Mina (Minawiyeh) have their own accent which is totally different than other accents in other areas and regions in Lebanon.

You will find cars double and triple parked. Cars going the wrong way down one way streets. Before attempting to cross the street, observe the locals. The idea is to spot a gap in the traffic and start across and hopefully people will stop. If this fails look for a pretty girl or a mother with young kids and let them cross before you. Good luck!\nThere is only one way to see Mina, walking. Mina is a small city and you can walk around the city in almost one hour. added to that, side walks are everywhere.\nIn order to visit Tripoli, you may need a taxi, which is not expensive, one dollar will be enough to take you to Tripoli city centre.
