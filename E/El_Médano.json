[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["El Médano"]}," is a town in Granadilla de Abona.\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nEl Médano (Spanish, \"The sand dune\") is a town in the municipality of Granadilla de Abona, on the island of Tenerife, one of the Canary Islands.\n\nA place of strong winds, it has been the site for various windsurfing competitions and championships, though in recent years, an increase in the number of high-rise hotels and apartment buildings has reduced these winds' power. However, El Médano is still one of the world's best windsurfing\/kitesurfing locations, with three different windsurfing spots, the Bay (flat\/swell), the Harbour Wall (wavespot sideshore), and Cabezo Beach (wavespot onshore).\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:vista.jpg"],["thumb"],["El Médano Beach"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nEl Médano can be reached by bus or by taxi (€12-15 from the airport). See www.titsa.com for bus timetables.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nEl Médano is small enough to cover everything on foot.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThe town is situated near the largest natural beaches of Tenerife, the Playa Grande and the Playa Tejita. Between the beaches is La Montaña Roja (\"The Red Mountain\"), a volcanic cone that is a protected natural reserve. It's a great place to relax and wind down. There is a large town square in front of the main beach, which holds many local fiestas, especially during the summer months and a spectacular annual public firework display across the bay. Around this square are many bars and restaurants where you can take a coffee or eat Spanish tapas or sea food. El Medano is located just north of the Reina Sofia airport, located in the south of Tenerife.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Bable Language Academy"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.bla-tenerife.com\/"],["email=info@babel.es"],["address=Plaza Galicia, Edf.
