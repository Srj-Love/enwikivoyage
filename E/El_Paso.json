These tacos are unlike either the \"Taco Bell\" tacos many Americans are familiar with, or those served in an authentic Mexican taquería. Resembling flautas more than tacos, a single order of tacos will not cost you more than $2.00 and provide you with three tacos. A \"double\" or \"triple\" order will fill up those who are more hungry. The tacos are served with a red sauce and piled high with cheese.
