[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"],["pgname=El Paso"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:ElPasoILLibrary.jpg"],["thumb"],["El Paso Carnegie library, 1912"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["El Paso"]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Illinois"]]}," is a charming little town approximately two hours south west of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chicago"]]},".  The area features a well-known winery, famous for its unique Midwestern flavor as well as miles of unspoiled corn fields.  But this town isn't a just another small town out there in the middle of a cornfield.  This town offers more for their residents and tourists.  Right off of Interstate 39 there are great restaurants for those seeking typical Midwestern style cuisine.  There is a well kept golf course that is a favorite hangout of the locals and rival many that are seen on TV. Money donated by Andrew Carnegie makes El Paso's library quite an establishment.  The train museum also is a must see for those interested in American history.  Numerous parks make this town a great place to take kids just for a weekend romp.  This town may be small but not compared to other towns like Panola.  This town is the best for people who live nearby who want an escape or who simply want to explore somewhere new.  It's in a perfect location for people who live in Chicago who want to take a little day trip or for people across the state line to visit. Truly a town that offers something many towns in the Midwest lack: character.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=El Paso Golf Club"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address=2860 County Road"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone =+1 309  527-5225"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=600 N."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=El Paso Public Library"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address=149 W 1st St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone =+1 309  527-4360"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["South Pointe Park"]},"  ",{"type":"''","value":["+1 (309) 527-8305"]},".
