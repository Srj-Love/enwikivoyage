It is generally accepted that the city is named after the second (",{"type":"''","value":["el segundo"]}," in Spanish) Standard Oil refinery on the West Coast, built in 1911.\n\nEl Segundo is two cities in one.  The coastal portion is a residential suburb with a charming Main Street which looks frozen in time.  Locals both affectionately and derisively call it \"Mayberry By The Sea\", referring to the sleepy fictional town  which was the setting for the American television show \"The Andy Griffith Show\" in the early 1960s.\n\nThe \"inland portion\" of El Segundo is a thriving business district.  Many large aerospace companies have facilities in El Segundo, including Boeing, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and The Aerospace Corporation, which is headquartered there. It is also home to the Los Angeles Air Force Base and the Space and Missile Systems Center and Toy Manufacturer Mattel.\n\nEl Segundo is also home to the blue butterfly, now an endangered species.These butterflies which once used to reside in the sand dunes of El Segundo over an area of 4.5 square miles have now been pushed into three small areas of what is left of those dunes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nEl Segundo is immediately south of LAX and most hotels offer free shuttle transfers to and from the airport.\n\nThe Metro Green Line runs along the eastern edge of El Segundo, with both Mariposa\/Nash and El Segundo\/Nash stations within city limits.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nEl Segundo is  nice quiet place to stay if you want to roam around in the rest of LA during the day.
