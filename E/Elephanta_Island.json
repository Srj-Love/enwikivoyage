From here, get the tickets for the launch (boat or ferry). The journey takes 1 hour to reach the island by sea. The launch travels at a speed of 14 Nautical miles. The tickets are available at the Maharastra tourism development corp (MTDC) at the entrance of Gateway. The Caves are off-visit on Mondays although the MTDC does sell boat tickets with the ticket saying so, so be aware. The launch (boat) leaves from gate no.4 at the rear of Gateway of India.\n\nThe ticket for Deluxe boat is Rs.130 for Adult, Rs. 90 for Child (3 to 7 years) which includes return journey. If you want to see the view from the upper deck, you have to pay Rs.10\/-extra to the launch (boat) operator. Economy boat charges are Rs. 20 less.\n\nThere are 2 types of launch: Economy and Deluxe. One is big, the other one is slightly smaller in size. Travelling by both carries its own fun experiences.\n\nThe first boat of the day is at 9AM; they may wait a little bit for more passengers, but they are pretty much leave the dock on time.  They have a boat going to Elephanta Island every 30 minutes.  Week days are less crowded than weekends.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nFrom the Gateway of India to the world famous Elephanta Caves, and from the hustle and bustle of the contemporary commerce of Mumbai, this trip is a journey back in time; to a time when faith, mysticism and art reigned supreme, when the challenge of carving out gigantic statues and caves from monoliths was accepted as a blessing, when the tryst with stone gave birth to passionate effigies of Hindu faith, a glorious testimony, even today, of the aesthetics and hard labour of our ancestors.\n\nWhen you arrive at the Elephanta Island, there will be lots of locals offering you the service to guide you around. Unless you are unfamiliar with the Indian god Shiva and would like to know the gory details of what happened to Shiva's world, you do not really need a tourist guide -- their charges are not really reasonable, i.e., Rs 2500 or more to tell you all about Indian Gods that you may not know if they are telling you the true stories or not and you would probably forget by the time you leave Elephanta Island. If you really want to know all about Elephanta caves and Shiva, you can buy a good book from any vendors when you walk up the hill to the caves -- remember you should always bargain. \n\nThere is a small train to take you from the dockside to the entrance. The price, Rs 10 for adults, unless you want to exercise which you do not really need, because you'll have a chance to really exercise by walking up to the cave, the whole 120 steep steps.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Elephanta_caves_main_hall.JPG"],["thumb"],["400px"],[{"type":"'''","value":["Entrance to Cave 1 at Elephanta"]}]]},"\nThe island, small and round, rises like the back of a giant turtle from amidst the azure depths of the Arabian Sea. You will take a narrow road after disembarking. This travels to the site of ascent, broken by the persuasive cries of the jamun wallahs selling the salted plum coloured fruit in cleverly designed pouches, holding not more than 7-8 jamuns in each.\nTo get to the caves, you will climb a steep street up, as the caves are located on the top of a hillock shaped island. This climb is followed by a long flight of sharp stone steps, where the old and the invalid used to be carried in palanquins by coolies. Some locals regard the caves as a religious place dedicated to Lord Shiva, which accounts for a large number of aged visitors.  There is a tourist tax of Rs 10 for adults and Rs 5 for children.  At the entrance of the park, one needs to pay an entrance fee, i.e., Rs 10 for Indian citizens and Rs 250 for foreign nationals.\n\nThere are several caves you can visit.  According to the guard there, there are only five caves on Elephanta Island.  But some of the maps show seven caves.  Except the first two caves at the entrance, other caves are small and not well developed.  You can also walk up to the top of the Island, it is called Cannon Hill.  There is a old cannon there and nothing else to see.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nTake lots of pictures and show them to your friends.\n\nBeware of the monkeys that roam around. They are quite used to the huge masses of people moving around. But they are not happy when kids and even pesky teenagers tease them by throwing stones or making weird sounds. There have been many cases of people been scratched or attacked by monkeys, usually in retaliation. If left alone, they will usually do nothing. Try to be with the crowd, especially if you have got some packed food with you and want to have a picnic in the area.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\nThere are many things for sale. There are paintings (look for ones with leaves). Most of the stuff is brought in from Mumbai and sold at a double or triple price, so while purchasing mementos, make sure to look out for something unique to the Island and the craft skills of the local people.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nOne thing you should not miss is eating the wild berries that the locals sell as they are delicious. Also, if you are interested in Indian food, MTDC resort offers a fine spread at a reasonable cost.\n\nThe view of the sea from the MTDC restaurant is really pleasing to the eye, and you can sip on you tea, coffee, beer, etc, while enjoying the view.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nIt is advisable to take lots of drinkable water with you from Mumbai itself.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nOvernight stay at Elephanta Caves is not permitted. If you want to rest during daytime, The ",{"type":"'''","value":["Maharastra Tourism Department Hotel"]}," is a good choice. They also serve food and drinks.\n\nIf you want to stay overnight, then you have to stay with the locals and that is not advisable.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nThe first boat leaving Elephanta Island for Mumbai is at 12:00 noon and the last one is at 5:30PM.  If you are fast, you can take the first boat from Mumbai to Elephanta Island, visit all caves, go up to Cannon Hill to see the old cannon, come back to the dockside, and take the first boat back to Mumbai.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["18.958333"],["72.930556"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Maharashtra"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Elephanta Caves"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Elephanta Caves"]]}]
