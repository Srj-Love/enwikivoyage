Harbour Island has the highest concentration of hotels; many of them upscale. Harbour Island is more densely populated than Eleuthera. The 3 mile beach on Harbour Island features pink sand and clear waters and has often been cited by various travel magazines as one of the most beautiful beaches in the world.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nEleuthera has no public transport system. There are taxis and car rentals. It's generally best to rent a car to explore Eleuthera. Hitchhiking is popular and locals are generally helpful and friendly.

Be prepared: Eleuthera's gas prices are $1-2 higher than the U.S. Car rental costs are based on a per day basis and never involve extra fees. In most cases, you don't sign papers. No car rental chain companies exist on Eleuthera -- you rent from locals who may keep a fleet of rental cars in their yards. Some entrepreneurs combine their car rental companies with a gas station or with a taxi company. As you drive around (on the LEFT-HAND side of the road), you will need a good map or good local knowledge.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bike"]},"\nEleuthera with its rolling hills (and three killers around Gregory Town) is the most challenging island of the Bahamas. The main road, Queen's Highway, the only option for road bikes) should not be ridden by beginners. For more casual riders, mountain bikes are fine; a hybrid is an ideal compromise. There are no bike shops and serious riders usually bring their own, but several resorts and individuals rent mountain bikes or hybrids. Refer to other pages on Eleuthera for details.\n\nBicycling is a growing sport and Eleuthera hosts the Cancer Society \"Ride for Hope,\" with 50-75-100 mile competitions, every April. The Queen's Highway is well paved (watch out for road repairs north of Governor's Harbour airport). Drivers are generally courteous, giving bikes a wide berth, but use a rearview mirror and wear a helmet. The greater danger lies ahead: cars pulling out to pass who may not see you coming at them. Be alert when you see an oncoming car closely following another. Another problem: being chased local dogs (\"pot-cakes\"). Lately there haven't been many, but be on the lookout south of Tarpum Bay and around Gregory Town.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.eleutheracarrental.com Eleuthera Car Rental by Gateway"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Leon Levy Nature Preserve What Lives Here Eleuthera 2013.JPG"],["thumb"],["Leon Levy Native Plant Preserve"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["The many beautiful beaches"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.levypreserve.org\/ The Leon Levy Native Plant Preserve"]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Current Cut in North Eleuthera"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Preachers' Cave in North Eleuthera"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Glass Window Bridge in North-Eleuthera"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Queen's Bath south of Glass Window Bridge"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Surfer's Beach south of Gregory Town"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Hatchet Bay Caves south of Gregory Town"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Ocean Hole in Rock Sound, South Eleuthera"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Lighthouse Beach \/ Bannerman Lighthouse south of Bannerman Town"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Enjoy"]}," (walk, swim, snorkel, get a tan, or whatever you like to do on beaches) ",{"type":"'''","value":["the many great beaches"]},".
