Remember that the hectic summer tourist season can at times be an abnormal and somewhat stressful experience for both locals and visitors, and that a smile and a kind word go a long way.

That name having been already taken by a settlement in Oxford County, Maine, the town was finally incorporated by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1800 as Ellsworth, named for Oliver Ellsworth, 3rd Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court and thought to be the person who first suggested the name \"United States of America\" for the newly formed country."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Davis also reports that in the late 1770s there were British raids on the Union River Settlement, with attempts to appropriate the local cattle.
