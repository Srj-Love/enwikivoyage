You just must make sure that you have a car in good working condition as there are basically no services for more than 50 miles at most times and summer temperatures can easily reach 110, and winter temperatures getting well below zero.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Downtown Ely, Nevada.JPG"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Downtown Ely"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:East Ely Depot, 1907.jpg"],["thumb"],["The landmarked East Ely Depot is now part of the Nevada Northern Railway Museum"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Nevada Northern Railway Museum"],["url=http:\/\/nevadanorthernrailway.net"],["email="],["lat=39.259323"],["long=-114.869066"],["image=2012.10.03.140030 Train station Ely Nevada.jpg"],["address=intersection of 11th Street and Avenue A"],["directions=in East Ely"],["phone=+1 775 289-2085"],["tollfree=+1-866-407-8326"],["fax=+1 775 289-6284"],["hours=Su: 8AM-4PM, M: 8AM-5PM, Tu: closed W-Sa: 8AM-5PM"],["price=Museum admission: Adults $4, Children $2.
