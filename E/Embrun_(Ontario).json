[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"],["pgname=Embrun"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Embrun"]}," is a town in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ontario"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Canada"]]},". While Embrun is part of the officially designated ",{"type":"[[","value":[["National Capital Region (Canada)"],["National Capital Region"]]},", it is usually considered to be part of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Eastern Ontario"]]},".\n\nIt is situated in between the towns of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Casselman (Ontario)"],["Casselman"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russell (Ontario)"],["Russell"]]},". It is located about 30 minutes southeast of Ottawa. It has a population of about 8,000 (2006). \n\nEmbrun is a growing town and new businesses and homes are being built. Embrun is one of the fastest-growing towns in Eastern Ontario by doubling its population in 25 years (Embrun had just 3,800 people in 1980). This has led to confusion about how big Embrun is since many data sources are out of date.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Status as an unincorporated town"]},"\nEmbrun is an unincorporated community. This means that although Embrun does exist, it does not have its own municipality. Instead it is part of the Russell Township, sometimes just called Russell. This has led to confusion between Russell Township and the village of Russell, a small village also located in Russell Township.\n\nThe important thing to understand here is that Embrun and Russell are separate towns and that both of them ",{"type":"'''","value":["together form the municipality of Russell Township"]}," (sometimes called Township of Russell).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["People"]},"\nEmbrun follows the small town stereotype of \"everyone knows everyone\". Many people know or have acquaintances with most other residents of the town. This is especially true among senior citizens.\n\nIf you have any questions about how to get somewhere, then many people will be glad to help. Senior citizens are particularly helpful.\n\nThere are several social clubs which are very active in activities in the community such as: The \"Club Optimiste Club\", Knights of Columbus, Octogone club, Carnival committe and Celebrons ensemble committe. These social clubs organize community related activities for children, young adults and seniors during the holiday season, during the \"Embrun Carnival\"(usually the last week of January each year) and Celebrons ensemble(yearly summer celebration of community).\n\nActivities are all sponsored by local businesses and encourage solid community relations.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Talk"]},"\nEmbrun is mainly francophone. 60% of the town's population speaks french at home. Despite this, however, many signs are bilingual (although bilingual signs are not required in Embrun) and in stores cashiers will often understand English.\n\nEven so, knowledge of a few basic words in French is useful. See the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["French phrasebook"]]}," on Wikivoyage to learn basic words in French.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:GetEmbrun.png"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Routes in and out of Embrun"]]},"\nThere is pretty much only one way to get to Embrun: By car. If you are coming from Ottawa, travel east (in the direction of Montreal) on Highway 417 and get off at Exit 88. The sign for Exit 88 says \"Rockdale Road: Vars, Embrun\". It takes about 25 minutes to get to Embrun from the Innes-Walkley area, 30 minutes from the St. Laurent area, 35 minutes from Orleans, 35 minutes from Downtown Ottawa, 40 minutes from the West End, and 50 minutes from Kanata.\n\nIf you are coming from Montreal, travel west (in the direction of Rigaud and Ottawa-Hull) on Highway 40. Once you hit Ontario, it will become Highway 417. Get off at Exit 79. The sign for Exit 79 says: \"Limoges Road: Limoges, Embrun\".\n\nIt takes about 90 minutes to get to Embrun from the West Island, 100 minutes from the Dorval\/Saint-Laurent\/Pierrefonds\/Cartierville area, 110 minutes from the Mont-Royal\/Centre-Ville area of Montreal, 115 minutes from Vieux-Montreal and 120 minutes from the Montreal-Est area.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:EmbrunOntarioMap.png"],["thumb"],["right"],["600px"],["Map of Embrun (click to enlarge)"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nGetting around Embrun by car is easy. Most of the town's tourist-related buildings and areas are accessible off the main road, called Notre-Dame Street. In addition, there are several parking lots along the road.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["On foot"]},"\nWhile harder, one can get around Embrun on foot. The downtown is fairly walkable, but in the rest of the town as well as the surrounding countryside it is impractical to walk. In the business park area in the western part of the town (near where Exit 88 hooks up with Embrun) there are many stores fairly close together, but the area is not very pedestrian friendly. A walk from one end of the town to the other can take almost an hour.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bicycle"]},"\nTraveling around Embrun by ",{"type":"[[","value":[["cycling"],["bicycle"]]}," is quite convinent. In the western part of the town, a bike trail links several streets. In the central part of the town, a pedestrian lane on the side of Blais Street hooks up with the bike trail. From there, one can travel on Centenaire Street, a relatively traffic-free road, to get to the eastern part of the town.\n\nBicycle rentals are available at Vélo Xpress, located at 968 Notre-Dame Street.
