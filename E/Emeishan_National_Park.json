Three-day entry tickets cost ¥150 (¥80 concession).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nMaps are available at the mountain, and visitors are free to travel around and enter the monasteries.  The mountain is big, but the monasteries offer cheap accommodation (10Y to 50Y per person; this information may be outdated, as some monasteries have asked upwards of ¥200\/person).  To comfortably see the whole mountain, you'll need at least three days, though you can reach the summit in a day.  The more interesting spots are the secluded ones away from the tourist areas. \n\nThere are buses that will take you halfway up the mountain (¥40) or to near the top (¥50). From the top bus station, you can also take a cable car (¥60 up, ¥55 down) the rest of the way to the summit. If you want to go down by bus (after hiking up), ticket from Leidong Terrace to Baoguo temple cost ¥50. Restaurants are located at convenient intervals so there is little need to carry food.

",{"type":"'''","value":["Caution is strongly advised."]}," Some people take sticks for their defense.\n\nHiking the mountain is a strenuous endeavor; although there are paved step paths to the summit, the trails are very steep in places, and hiking from Wannian Monastery to the Golden summit is about 30 km. Distances between accommodations can be large, so be sure that you'll be near one at sundown. Snow covers much of the top 18 km well into spring, so invest in a bamboo hiking pole and some crampons.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Golden Summit"]}," - With a towering, multi-face statue of Samantabhadra and vertigo-inducing views of the cloud sea around the mountain, the peak makes a perfect reward for the thigh-shattering climb from Baoguo.

If you are tired there you can take a sedan chair carried by people (but what you save in strain you'll spend in Yuan). Cable cars go to the summit and there is another one to the south to lessen the strenuous climbs.\nOne of the most picturesque area is located between Niuxin Pavilion and Xianfeng Temple. \nThe beginning of trail from Emeishan is through Leyin temple, cross concrete road, near Lin He restaurant\/hotel\/shop, between Fuhu temple (entrance fee Y6) & Shanjue temple stairs.\n\nDuring winter there is a skiing area, close to the summit.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\nHawkers sell straw or bamboo poles and crampons to attach to boots, which will be necessary when paths are slippery in the winter and \/ or spring\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nThe monasteries all offer delicious vegetarian fare for around ¥15 a person though breakfast options might be a disappointing bowl of rice with water and a steamed bun for ¥10 a person. If you want a meat based Chinese meal, there are restaurants close to the tourist temples.  Cooked food at pit stops and the restaurants can be wildly expensive (¥40 for a plate of fried noodles), so check prices and consider pot-o-noodles if you're the budget-conscious type. You can also get snacks at several places along the trails.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nDo not drink from the mountain streams.  There are several shacks along the way that sell bottled water for ¥5. They are frequent enough that you don't need to worry about water when hiking. And there's boiled water in almost every temple.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nThe best places to stay are the monasteries. Most of them offer accommodation but as of April, 2012 this may no longer be a cheap bet with prices of ¥120 or more for a very basic twin room with no heating or electric blankets. Like ",{"type":"'''","value":["Xianfeng Temple, Elephant Bathing Pool, Hongchun Ping, Huayan Peak, Jieyin Hall"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Wannian Temple"]},". Again, you can find regular hotels close to the tourist spots that are expensive.  There are guesthouses along the mountain for around ¥60 a person, though they offer frigid rooms and not much else. Baoguo Village is the closest place to the foot of the mountain.  Here you'll find the popular Teddy Bear Cafe & Hotel. They will hold your luggage until you return. Note that accommodation at monasteries closest to tourist spots tends to be more expensive. Bathrooms tend to be primitive and not for the faint-hearted. Don't expect any wifi or power outlets in rooms.\nHotels prices at the top are around Y200-400. In best case, can find one and bargain down to Y100+50 for key deposit. Hotels can have electric blankets.\n\nNote; if you've a room at the hotel at the top of the mountain and you are at the skiing area, check the departure time for the last bus leaving either up or down the mountain to avoid being stranded for a very cold stay at the mid-mountain hotels. They are pretty much not heated. The heat they do have is so little that it will be below zero in your room. During this time of the year much of the plumbing is also shut down so do not expect running water anywhere Including the toilets! Instead, toilet bowls are lined with plastic garbage bags which get carried off in the morning.\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Emei Mountain Youth Hotel"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=in Baoguo Village, just off the main road"],["phone=5591698"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout=12"],["content=A great, atmospheric little place at the foot of Emei Mountain. 30 kuai for a dorm bed (before bargaining) and 50 for a double room (without ensuit).

These monkeys have been severely teased by many tourists so their behaviour is unpredictable. If you come across any monkeys outside of the temples, do not stop to take pictures or stare as they will bite if provoked. Just walk briskly away and talk in a soothing voice to calm the monkeys enough to leave you alone. Pack rain gear and wear stout footwear as the paths get slippery, especially from October to April. Hawkers sell straw poles and crampons to attach to boots. Warm clothing is essential at the summit year round. Don't forget that even though it's touristy, it's still a mountain. Staircases can be tiring, and the distances are quite far (120 km in two tracks). It isn't Everest, but at 10,000 feet, it's at the lower limit of altitude sickness inducing heights. You're more prone to headaches and exhaustion, so drink water, pace yourself on the upper staircases, and stop ascending if you feel faint or nauseous.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Leshan"]]}," Grand Buddha"]}," - A massive, 230 feet high buddha carved into the mountainside."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chongqing"]]}," is a grand city on the Yangtze"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yangtze"],["Yangtze River"]]}," offers many scenic cruising options to the north"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chengdu"]]}," is both historic and modern.
