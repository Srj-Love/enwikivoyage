Built in honor of the Roman consul Mark Emilio Facetious, it was called ",{"type":"''","value":["Aemilia"]},". The region is named after this road and defined by it: all the important cities, with the exception of Ferrara and Ravenna, are actually on the Via Emilia. In the 6th century the Romans lost this territory, which was divided between the Longobards and the Byzantines ( Eastern Roman Empire), and the territories were named Longobardia and Romania respectively. With the unity of Italy, the Region acquired the original Roman name of Emilia, and it was only in 1947 that the name of Emilia-Romagna was assigned. \n\nEmilia-Romagna is a region of gentle hills between the River Po and the Appennines, sloping gently down to the Adriatic in the east. As elsewhere in the Po Basin, intensive agriculture is pursued alongside small and medium industry. \n\nDuring the summer months the miles and miles of sandy beaches on the Adriatic coast are a mecca for Italian tourists, and are also particularly popular with Northern and Eastern Europeans.\n\nThe are many local dialects and each town has its own distinctive accent and vocabulary. Bolognese is very different from Forlivese which is different from the Romagnolo of the coast, which is different again from the Romagnolo of the Appenine mountains. In Emilia, Parma and Modena may be close together but the dialects spoken are far from identical.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nThere are international airports in Rimini, Bologna, Parma, outside Milan called Linate, and nearby ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ancona"]]},".\n\nTrains and roads run the length of the Po river to the coast from Milan, linking the airports and the resorts.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nMany of the larger cities like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Parma"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bologna"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Forlì"]]},", for example, have bus service into the countryside. Bologna is a major train station with Eurostar, as is Rimini.\nIf you can, rent a car and take any of the many roads that branch off the Autostrada and head south into the Alpennine Mountains where you will find hot spring spas, ancient castles protecting mountain passes (don't miss ",{"type":"'''","value":["Castello Torrechiara"]},", near Parma).\n\nSide note: While taking the train south from Milan, don't forget to catch a glimpse of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Domo"]}," perched above Bologna in the south. It is especially interesting at sunset.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nThe region is famed for its culinary delights, especially the fine gold coloured egg pastas like",{"type":"'''","value":[" Tortellini"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Tagliatelle"]}," and  the green ",{"type":"'''","value":["Lasagne Verdi"]},"  all from Bologna. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Gramigna"]}," is another Bologna pasta, then there are ",{"type":"'''","value":["Garganelli"]}," from Imola, ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cappelletti"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Passatelli"]}," from Reggio Emilia and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Anolini"]}," from Piacenza. Ricotta and greens filled ",{"type":"'''","value":["Tortelli"]}," are served throughout both Emilia and Romagna. \n\nBologna is also famous for its ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ragù"]}," known in English as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bolognese sauce"]}," (which is *never* served on Spaghetti) and for fragrant ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mortadella"]}," (centuries old  and noble Italian ancestor of the unpleasant present day Oscar Meyer).\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Parmigiano Reggiano cheese"]}," is made in a large part of Emilia starting with Bologna itself and ranging North and West through to Modena, Reggio Emilia and Parma. \"Parmigiano Reggiano\"  was originally made only with the superior quality milk obtained from the red coated cows of Reggio Emilia, called ",{"type":"'''","value":["Razza Reggiana"]}," in Italian. Parmigiano Reggiano is at its best when it has been aged for between 24 and 30 months. The cheese made with the milk of the red cows ages even longer and is excellent at 36 months.\n\nThe region also produces cured hams including, besides the famous ",{"type":"'''","value":["Prosciutto di Parma"]},", other excellent products like ",{"type":"'''","value":["Prosciutto di Modena"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Culatello di Zibello"]},". Piacenza is famed for its ",{"type":"'''","value":["coppa"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["salame"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["pancetta"]},", Modena for its ",{"type":"'''","value":["Zampone"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cotecchino"]},". Cured pork products like ",{"type":"'''","value":["Lardo"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["Guanciale"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["Salame"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Pancetta"]}," made from the ancient ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mora Romagnola"]}," breed of pig are the pride of Romagna.. \n\nThe original Balsamic vinegar ",{"type":"'''","value":["Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale"]}," is produced only in this region, in the neighbouring towns of Modena and Reggio Emilia. It is made exclusively of cooked down pressed grape juice and has to be aged for a minimum 12 years in wooden barrels before being bottled. The word \"tradizionale\" is essential on the label. The Balsamic Vinegar which is not Tradizionale is made only of the very cheap ingredients of vinegar and sugar.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nThere are three broad wine areas: Emilia, Bologna and Romagna.\n\nIn Emilia (everywhere west and north of Bologna from Modena to Piacenza)  the favourite wine to drink with all the rich local specialities is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Lambrusco"]},": tart, dry and worlds away from the sickly export version. Also appreciated is Piacenza's  red Gutturnio, a blend of Bonarda and Barbera grapes. Whites in Emilia include cool Sauvignons and sparkling wines made from the aromatic ",{"type":"'''","value":["Malvasia"]}," grape. Both make fine \"food wines\" ie wines to go with food.\n\nBologna's local grape ",{"type":"'''","value":["Pignoletto"]}," makes a very fine white, traditionally always sparkling but now made in a still version by many of local wine estates. It can be drunk as an aperitif or throughout a meal. Bologna also has prize wining red wines made using Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon as well as a lightly sparkling Barbera. There is also a long history of wine making using Sauvignon, Chardonnay and Italian Riesling, but as in the rest of the region, dry whites are made from the Trebbiano and the Albana grapes, though this last is most used to make the region's famous dessert wines.\n\nMuch of the best of this region's wine comes from Romagna (everywhere south and east of Bologna), where the whole area makes superb ",{"type":"'''","value":["Sangiovese di Romagna"]},". These wines make for fine drinking at bargain prices, considering the grape is the same as the that used for Chianti  but sells at a fraction of the price. Many top producers ( from Imola, Forli, Faenza and Ravenna, to name but a few of the wine areas) have for years been winning top prizes both nationally and internationally for their excellent Sangiovese di Romagna wines.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Veneto"]]}," lies directly north.
