The journey takes about 46 hours, longer if delays occur along the route. Passengers may be forced to take buses for part of the route if track work is being done. (Track work is not announced until the day of departure.) Equipment used is common to most Amtrak long-distance routes, with two-level ",{"type":"''","value":["Superliner"]}," passengers cars, sleeper cars, dining car, an observation\/snack bar car, and possibly several baggage\/expedited cargo cars.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Route Overview"]},"\nThe ",{"type":"''","value":["Empire Builder"]}," begins its westbound journey at Chicago's Union Station ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.chicagounionstation.com\/"]},".

The route parallels, US highway 2 much of this stretch. Sights include the high prairie, once-prosperous farming towns (now almost vanished). Wildlife, especially birds, deer and coyote are often seen.  \n\nAround noon, the ",{"type":"''","value":["Empire Builder"]}," crosses into Montana. As you enter Montana, at the left of the train, you can see the large flag and reconstructed fur trading post of the Fort Union National Monument. The train loosely follows the Missouri River (and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lewis and Clark Trail"]]},") for about 130 miles between Williston ND and Wolf Point MT. This strech passes through the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, one of several Indian reservations on the route. \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Glacier National Park sunset.jpg"],["250px"],["thumbnail"],["Sunset at Glacier National Park"]]},"\nThe scenery remains rolling high plains for several more hours.  In the late afternoon\/early evening (depending on the season traveled in) the train arrives at Glacier National Park.  In summer, the mountain vistas are beautiful—however, the light will fade quickly in winter, giving only a glimpse of the Rocky Mountains.\n\nThe train traverses the mountains through the second night, traveling down the Cascade Mountains and Skykomish River valley to the Puget Sound.  After an hour or so following the waterfront, the ",{"type":"''","value":["Empire Builder"]}," arrives in Seattle (approx. 10:20 AM, typically).\n\nPassengers bound for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Portland_(Oregon)"],["Portland, Oregon"]]}," have their rail cars diverted at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Spokane"],["Spokane, WA"]]}," in the middle of the second night. By the time it gets light in the morning you are well out of the mountains and are traveling down the north side of the Columbia River to Portland. This is actually one of the most scenic parts of the trip. You see log rafts, wind surfers, dams, sagebrush.
