And rightly so, as it contains the one of world's oldest rainforests and the volcanic rocks there date back 240 million years. Its name is derived from the two rivers through the park; the Endau river in the south in the state of Johor and the Rompin river in the state of Pahang in the north. It also has some unique flora and fauna, including the endangered Sumatran Rhino. It has some of Malaysia's best waterfalls namely Buaya Sangkut, Upeh Guling and Batu Hampar all within 2 hours trek of each other. Also you'll get a chance to meet the indigenous peoples of Peninsular Malaysia, known locally as ",{"type":"''","value":["Orang Asli"]},". The major tribe that call the park home is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Jakun"]},".\n\nA proper trip to see all the major highlights of Endau-Rompin National Park should take 3 days. Of course it's not hard to spend a week to get lost amidst the breathtaking rivers and forests. Unless you're an experienced jungle trekker, it's best to stick to the packages offered – the Johor National Parks Corporation organises the most reasonably priced ones. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\n\nThe Orang Hulu (Indigenous people) of the area tells a story of an old crocodile that lived in the pools above the waterfall. One day it floated downriver and got itself trapped between the boulders where its body formed the cascades of the fall. (buaya = crocodile, sangkut = trapped). Another less popular story but entertaining all the same tells of a family who lived by the banks of Sungai Jasin. The father dreamt of his son's death in the jaws of a crocodile that lived in the river. He took it as a warning and with that, moved his family upstream. The recurring dream drove the family further upstream pass the waterfall. True to the premonitions of these dreams, the crocodile had followed them. On climbing the fall, the croc lodged itself between the boulders and the father took this opportune moment to kill it. He made a drum from the leather of the crocodile and hung the drum high in the house. One day as the son was playing below the drum, it fell on him killing him instantly.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nThe weather is generally hot and humid all year round. Temperatures ranges between 25 and 33 degrees Celsius. \n\nRainy season is between mid December to mid January. \n\nMost appropriate clothing for the jungle are loose-fitting cotton long-sleeved shirts and long pants to help keep  insects at bay. Leech socks are advisable.\n\nWear comfortable boots or sneakers.\n\nHelpful to bring along a first aid kit, torchlight and insect repellent.\n\nVisitors are requested to help the Department of Wild Life preserve nature' beauty by keeping litter and noise pollution to the minimum.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nThere are 3 entrances to the Endau-Rompin National Park. You can either enter through ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Johor"]]}," (East or West) or through ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pahang"]]},". A different entrance would mean a different adventure as the Johor National Parks Corporation manages the Johor portion of the park while the area encompassed by Pahang comes under the Pahang National Parks Corporation.\n\nThe Johor Endau Rompin East approach (Kampung Peta) is the more popular, time saving and easier approach. If you are driving, it's best to take a 4WD, as there are no tarred roads for the last 20km of the journey, only mud tracks. You need to inform the Johor National Parks Corporation at least a week prior to your departure. If you are coming from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kuala Lumpur"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Johor Bahru"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Singapore"]]},", use the National Highway and exit at Air Hitam. Turn right at the exit and drive on for another hour to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kluang"]]},". Whatever last minute supplies you need would be best bought here. From here drive another 40km along the route to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mersing"]]}," and you'll reach Kahang, where the last petrol station before the Park can be found. About 3km from Kahang, turn at right at the park sign.  The first 35km will be through oil palm plantations, a rather uneven and bumpy track in the beginning, followed by tarred roads and finally through a laterite track. Then the last 22km will run through uninhabited rainforest. This is a mud track with a lot of protruding rocks, potholes, and wooden bridges that don't allow room for mistakes.\n(Please note currently, 31st of July 2008, the main bridge giving access to the park over this road is broken.)\n\nThe Johor Endau Rompin West entrance is near the town of Bekok near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Segamat"]]},". Here, due to the condition of the track, one can enter only by using 4WD vehicles.\n\nThe third entrance (from Pahang) is reached from the town of Kuala Rompin. Drive along a paved road to Seladang, and then follow a 26km dirt track to the park boundary at Kuala Kinchin.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nEndau Rompin East Entry from Kahang (Johore)\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Park Headquarters:"]}," The office is housed in a large and beautiful two level wooden structure.
