[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Enez"]}," (pronounced ",{"type":"''","value":["ay-nayz"]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.enez.gov.tr"]},") is a small town in southwestern corner of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Eastern Thrace"]]},", European part of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Turkey"]]},". It is located on the northern shores of the Aegean Sea, near where the river Maritsa (",{"type":"''","value":["Meriç"]}," in Turkish, ",{"type":"''","value":["Evros"]}," in Greek) empties into the sea. Its ancient name was ",{"type":"''","value":["Ainos"]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nOne of the last places in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Eastern Thrace"]]}," that the Ottoman Turks had taken control of, Enez, or Ainos as it was called then, was captured by Ottomans a full three years after the fall of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Istanbul"],["Constantinople"]]},", in 1456, from the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Genoa"],["Genoese"]]}," who ruled the town since 1355 as one of their trading posts along the Aegean and Black Sea coasts.\n\nEnez today is a sleepy provincial town which sees some sort of liveliness only June through August, when people from surrounding towns and cities—especially from nearby inland city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Edirne"]]},"—move in for the summer to their holiday homes in the conglomeration of two-storey buildings on the plains behind the beach, 5 km south of Enez, and actually several times larger and more populous than the town proper itself (which has a constant\/winter population of around 4,000). During this time, Enez can be reasonably dubbed as \"Edirne-all-packed-and-moved-to-the-beach\". During the rest of the year, though, the beach neighbourhood turns into a total ghost town.\n\nEnez sees almost no international travellers, and the fact that the town was a military zone until early 2000s with very limited access for non-Turks as it lies just on the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Greece"],["Greek"]]}," border plays no small part in this, although it's now open to all.\n\nSights in the town can be done as in little time as half a day, even if you pay a ",{"type":"''","value":["very"]}," detailed attention. The main draw is actually the long, sandy beach and the crystal clear sea, spared from all kinds of pollution.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nThere are one or two direct bus connections daily with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Istanbul"]]}," in summer. The seats are sold out in a very short time, so buy your ticket in advance.

At ",{"type":"''","value":["eski garaj"]},", you will be able to find a (likely non-air conditioned) minibus heading for Enez, departing within half an hour at most. Keşan-Enez ride takes about an hour while Istanbul-Keşan takes about three and a half hour.\n\nThere are also direct buses from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Edirne"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nGo to Keşan first, which can be reached by taking D110\/E90 from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Greece"],["Greco"]]},"-Turkish border\/",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ipsala"]]}," (west), D110\/E84 from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Istanbul"]]},"\/",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tekirdağ"]]}," (east), D550\/E87 from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Edirne"]]}," (north), D550\/E87\/E90 from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gelibolu"]]},"\/",{"type":"[[","value":[["Çanakkale"]]}," (south).

From Keşan, Enez is a 60 km drive away and the road is somewhat narrow in some parts.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nThe nearest station is in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Uzunköprü"]]},", about 80 km away and which has two daily connections with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Istanbul"]]},".

The name of the inn (“barracks of the Englishmen” in Turkish) comes from the fact that the building was once used by the British traders who were buying oak trunks to produce charcoal in Britain.
