There is little public transportation in place, and sidewalks can be scarce at times. It is possible to bicycle around the town, but a good deal of time and patience is required.  Although you can use cab services and in the more rural areas you can usually walk from place to place.  Average walking distances are less than a mile if you live in the right area.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThings to see in Enfield are very limited due to its size.  The only historic areas are around Powder Hollow and these are very scattered.  While some may be right infront at the Powder Mill Barn others are lost deep in the woods around the Scantic River.  The Scantic River itself is a very beautiful river surround by a great deal of Northeastern wildlife.  You can go here to hike, camp, walk, or even to simply have a picnic.  It is now considered a park however and opens at dawn, whiel closing at dusk.  Even with these new rules in effect it is a great place to spend a day because of all the nature you get to see, or even if you simply wish to go fishing.  The fish in the area are common ones and run average in size.  The most common Fish are Rock bass, small mouth bass, large mouth bass, catfish, trout (rainbow, brown\/brook), and of course pumpkin seeds.  The river itself is stocked with trout each year and is a very popular place to bring the kids to fish. Should you venture deeper into the woods you will fidn that there are multiple trails that all lead around the area.  Some take you to the gravel pits, while others take you to the Stoker's Cattle Farm.  They all are around the river.  Though some of the trails go up and away fro mthe river a little bit they are still within a distance that you can saftley not get lost.  This is also a popular area for quading and dirt biking because of these dirt paths that are set down all over the woods.  \n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Powder Mill Barn"],["url=http:\/\/www.sweetheartflute.com\/Barn\/"],["email="],["address=32 South Maple Street"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +1 860-749-4494"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=A very historical barn from the Hazard Power Co. that supplied a great deal of gunpowder during the Civil War.
