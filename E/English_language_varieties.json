[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["TT Banner.jpg"]]},"\nEnglish is the main language in many places, an important language in others, and spoken as a second language more-or-less everywhere. However, there are some significant differences in pronunciation, spelling and word usage around the world. This article aims to provide a list of some of these differences that may be useful to travellers.\n\nThe clearest distinction is between what can be loosely called the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Commonwealth"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["American"]}," varieties of English.\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Many areas — Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and other former British possessions in Africa, Hong Kong, Singapore, India, Pakistan, Malaysia, and current and former British possessions in the Caribbean — (not all of them Commonwealth members) generally follow British rather than American usage."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Some areas like the Philippines, Israel and parts of Latin America are heavily influenced by the US and generally follow American usage."]},{"type":"*","value":[" People in areas without a history of direct colonial or military influence by English-speaking nations now tend to be more familiar with American usage because of the overwhelming popularity of U.S. films, TV series, music and spell-checkers. However, all 28 countries of the EU have mandated the variety of English used in Cyprus, Ireland, Malta and the UK as an official language."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Canada generally follows British spelling conventions (labour, not labor) and American vocabulary choices (elevator, not lift). Most Canadian accents are very close to a Midwestern U.S. accent. Canadians also use more terms of French origin than other dialects and are more likely to pronounce them as French speakers do."]},"\nSome exceptions to the purely dichotomous treatment of English are noted in comments in the tables below, but this guide is meant to be a practical aid for travellers, and not exhaustive.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Spelling"]},"\nNoah Webster, compiler of the first major dictionary of American English in the early 19th century, made a number of \"simplifications\" in the spelling. These are now standard in the U.S., but generally not used elsewhere.\n\nSee ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikivoyage:Spelling"]]}," for discussion of which variants to use in articles.\n\nBritish English doubles the final consonant in some words when adding an ending, for example in \"traveller\". American English usually spells it \"traveler\".\n\nBritish English changes a \"C\" to an \"S\" to distinguish a noun from a verb. James Bond has a \"licen",{"type":"<","value":["span",{"style":"text-decoration:underline;"},["c"]]},"e\" to kill, and was \"licen",{"type":"<","value":["span",{"style":"text-decoration:underline;"},["s"]]},"ed\" after qualifying as a spy.  The American form always uses the \"S\".\n\nAmerican usage drops the \"U\" in \"",{"type":"''","value":["-our"]},"\" endings:\n",{"type":"{|","value":[["class=\"wikitable\""],["!width=\"50%\" | American !!width=\"50%\" | British"],["|-"],["| color || colour"],["|-"],["| harbor || harbour"]]},"\n\nWords borrowed from French keep the French \"",{"type":"''","value":["-re"]},"\" ending in British English, but get changed to the more phonetic \"",{"type":"''","value":["-er"]},"\" in American English:\n",{"type":"{|","value":[["class=\"wikitable\""],["!width=\"50%\" | American !!width=\"50%\" | British"],["|-"],["| center || centre"],["|-"],["| theater || theatre"],["|-"],["| liter || litre"]]},"\n\nIn all Englishes except US, a \"metre\" is a unit of length while a \"meter\" is a measuring instrument. In American English both are a \"meter\".\n\nFor a number of verbs, the older irregular spellings are more common in British English but the regular -ed forms predominate in American English. The verb \"dive\", however, has the opposite usage pattern.\n",{"type":"{|","value":[["class=\"wikitable\""],["! American !! British !! Comment"],["|-"],["| dreamed  || dreamt ||"],["|-"],["| spelled || spelt ||"],["|-"],["| burned || burnt ||"],["|-"],["| learned || learnt ||"],["|-"],["| dove || dived ||"]]},"\nSome verbs retain the older form everywhere, for example \"slept\" and \"wept\".\n\nSome words have silent letters dropped or are spelled more phonetically in American English:\n",{"type":"{|","value":[["class=\"wikitable\""],["! American !! British !! Comment"],["|-"],["| analog  || analogue ||"],["|-"],["| check || cheque ||"],["|-"],["| program || programme || UK usage is mixed: 'computer program' vs. 'television programme'"],["|-"],["| tire || tyre ||"],["|-"],["| airplane || aeroplane ||"]]},"\n\nThis last group is the only one where Canadian usage routinely includes American spellings, with exceptions like \"cheque\" and sometimes \"programme\".\n\nMany American spellings of words, such as \"program\" and \"analog\", are widely adopted and understood outside the U.S.\n\nIncidentally, punctuation usage differs slightly as well, but doesn't follow the same division between British and American English. Quotations are marked by double quotation marks ",{"type":"<","value":["span",{"style":"white-space:nowrap"},["(",{"type":"'''","value":["“"]},"…",{"type":"'''","value":["”"]},")"]]}," in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, while single quotation marks ",{"type":"<","value":["span",{"style":"white-space:nowrap"},["(",{"type":"'''","value":["‘"]},"…",{"type":"'''","value":["’"]},")"]]}," are used in the UK and South Africa.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Pronunciation"]},"\nEnglish has an enormous range of accents and dialects — the UK alone has dozens — and some can be almost incomprehensible to other English speakers, let alone the poor traveller for whom English is a second language.\n\nEducated people from almost anywhere in the English-speaking world can talk to each other without serious difficulty. Consider an international crew on an oil rig somewhere. The engineers and managers would almost certainly be able to talk to each other without any real problems, whether they studied in Edinburgh or Edmonton. However, two working guys from the same two countries — say working class Glasgow and a Newfoundland fishing village — would be quite likely to find communication a bit difficult.  \n\nAn important difference in English dialects is whether \"R\" is pronounced after a vowel. Words such as \"fo",{"type":"<","value":["span",{"style":"text-decoration:underline;"},["r"]]},"k\", \"wo",{"type":"<","value":["span",{"style":"text-decoration:underline;"},["r"]]},"d\" or \"mothe",{"type":"<","value":["span",{"style":"text-decoration:underline;"},["r"]]},"\" are quite different in the two types, though everyone pronounces the \"R\" in other contexts, for example in \"rabbit\" or \"area\".\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Dialects with the \"R\": Scots, Irish, Canadian, much of the U.S."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Dialects without \"R\": Most of England, Wales, Australia, New Zealand, India, Pakistan, Boston, parts of the Southern U.S., some New York City-area accents, and African American Vernacular English (used by many African Americans interchangeably with the standard dialect of their region)."]},"\nAll dialects, except for some Southern U.S. dialects, pronounce the linking \"R\" in an expression like \"the mothe",{"type":"<","value":["span",{"style":"text-decoration:underline;"},["r"]]}," of\", even the ones that would not pronounce it in \"I saw his mothe",{"type":"<","value":["span",{"style":"text-decoration:underline;"},["r"]]},".\" Some insert a linking \"R\" sound between words like \"the area",{"type":"<","value":["span",{"style":"text-decoration:underline;"},[{"type":"''","value":["r"]}]]}," of a circle\".\n\nPeople not familiar with dialects other than their own sometimes lump all \"R\"-less dialects together, as when an American takes a New Zealand accent for British, and others make the opposite error, like an Englishwoman taking a Canadian accent for Irish. \n \nCertain words are pronounced very differently. In parts of the U.S., \"borough\" rhymes with \"furrow\" but elsewhere the final consonant is an \"",{"type":"''","value":["uh"]},"\" sound.\n\nThe words \"route\" and \"router\" can be pronounced to rhyme with \"shoot\" and \"shooter\" anywhere, but in North America they can also rhyme with \"shout\" and \"shouter\". Sometimes it is safer to use the latter pronunciation, whatever your own dialect has, because in Australian and New Zealand English, \"root\" is slang for sex, much the way \"screw\" is in North American English.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Vocabulary"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Get in\/around"]},"\n\nNote that for terms related to motor vehicles, Canadian English uses American terminology and spelling exclusively. This is likely because Canada's auto industry has been dominated by U.S. firms from its beginning. \n",{"type":"{|","value":[["class=\"wikitable sortable\""],["|-"],["! US !!

An Imperial gallon is 160 fluid ounces (4.5 liters) but a U.S. gallon is 128 ounces (3.78 liters). Both sizes of gallon are subdivided into four quarts or eight pints. A handy but very rough approximate conversion is to treat a liter as a quart; actually 1 liter is about 34 fluid ounces, more than a U.S. quart (32 ounces) but less than an imperial quart (40 ounces). The main exception to the use of U.S. customary measures is large soft drink bottles, which are typically 2 liters (some 3-liter bottles can also be found in stores). The 2-liter bottle is the last major legacy of a failed U.S. push toward metrication in the mid-1970s which coincided with the introduction of the now-standard plastic soft drink bottles.\n\nIn road signs, both the U.S. and the UK continue to use the old Imperial system. This means that speed limits are marked in miles per hour, and distances are also written in miles. 1 mile is roughly equivalent to 1.6 km.\n\nA \"pint\" of beer in many places is now 500 ml.
