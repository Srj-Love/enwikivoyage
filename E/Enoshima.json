If your Narita Express train terminates at Yokohama, get off one stop earlier at Musashi-Kosugi for a convenient same-platform transfer to another local train to Ofuna. From Ofuna, Enoshima is 15 minutes away on the Shonan Monorail (¥300).\n\nThe ride on the Narita Express to Ofuna costs ¥4500, although for foreigners the one-way cost can be brought down to ¥1500 by purchasing a ",{"type":"'''","value":["N'EX Tokyo Direct Ticket"]},"; this same fare applies if you change trains as described above. \n\nFrom ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Haneda Airport"]]},", airport limousine buses depart every 30-60 minutes for Ofuna and Fujisawa train stations (60-90 minutes, ¥1220 and ¥1330 respectively). From Ofuna you can go to Enoshima in 15 minutes on the Shonan Monorail (¥300). Connections from Fujisawa to Enoshima are available on the Odakyu railway (7 minutes to Katase-Enoshima, ¥150) or the Enoden tramway (11 minutes, ¥210). \n\nAlternatively you can go to Enoshima using three trains: the Keikyu Line to Yokohama (via Kamata), the JR Tokaido Line to Ofuna, and the Shonan Monorail to Enoshima - with good connections the trip takes about an hour at a cost of ¥1060. For access closer to the island, take the Tokaido Line one more stop to Fujisawa station and change to the Odakyu railway - this takes about the same amount of time at a cost of ¥1020.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Enoden100tankoro.JPG"],["thumb"],["Enjoy the seaside view from the old Enoden train"]]},"\nYou can take the private Odakyu line from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tokyo\/Shinjuku"],["Shinjuku"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fujisawa"]]}," (54 minutes via ",{"type":"''","value":["kaisoku-kyūkō"]},"　(快速急行)　or 66 minutes via ",{"type":"''","value":["kyūkō"]}," (急行)), then change onto the rattling old ",{"type":"'''","value":["Enoden"]}," (江ノ電) half-train\/half-streetcar line to Enoshima. The ",{"type":"'''","value":["Enoshima-Kamakura Free Pass"]}," (¥1,430) will get you a roundtrip from Shinjuku and unlimited use of the Enoden line for one day.\n\nIf you don't want to experience the vintage Enoden, you also have the option of taking the Odakyu all the way to Katase-Enoshima (片瀬江ノ島) station, which is the closest location to the main beaches and the island of Enoshima. There are not too many direct trains from Shinjuku; however, a connection at Sagami-Ono or Fujisawa is easy and convenient (you walk about 10m to the other side of the platform).\n\nFor a small extra charge you can take the all-reserved limited express \"Romance Car\" train direct from Shinjuku to Katase-Enoshima.

Users of the above-mentioned free pass can upgrade to the Romance Car for ¥600 each way.\n\nIf you have a Japan Rail Pass, you can reach Fujisawa by taking a Tokaido Line from Tokyo (about 50 minutes) or a Shonan-Shinjuku line train from Shinjuku (about 50 minutes) at no charge, then pay the fee for the Enoden. A better, faster and more exciting way is to take the Tokaido or Shonan Shinjuku Line and change in Ofuna (大船）to the Shonan Monorail　（湘南モノレール）, one of the few hanging monorails, that will take you directly to Enoshima（湘南江ノ島）in about 20 min.

It's easier just to walk from the station.\n\nThere is often a small, walk-on ferry that runs back & forth between the causeway and the back of the island (near the caves).  It takes 5 minutes, costs about ¥ 400 and will save approximately 45 minutes walking time making it possible to see all the sights the island has to offer in one day.\n\nMost pathways in Enoshima the island only allow foot traffic but are easily reached on foot.

Two bridges - one for cars, the other for foot and bicycle traffic - provide the main access.\n\nTourists come to this island to walk the pathways that lead to several ancient temples,  botanical garden, museums, parks, scenic overlooks, and a modern lighthouse at the top of the island. If you are not in great shape for the stairs and hills, escalators are available for a fee (and a 700 yen ticket includes fee for lighthouse elevator).\n\nThe classic view of Mt. Fuji as depicted in Japanese art can be seen from Enoshima on clear days (best season for viewing is winter). Giant hawks called ",{"type":"''","value":["tombe"]}," fill the skies, squawking and diving. Nature is abundant on the island.\n\nThe island is surrounded by high sea cliffs, rocks and tidal pools. The pounding surf and rocks make swimming at the island rather suicidal but many people walk across the exposed rocks, exploring the tidal pools and crab pots. At the end of the pathways at the 'back of the island' are ancient caves to explore. One cave network contains religious object, historical photographs and an automated fire-breathing dragon.  The token entrance fee includes quaint, candle lanterns carried to light up danker portions of the cave. \n\nThe main pathways lead to all the places of interest and go over the top of the island to the backside. Be warned that it can be a steep hard walk (especially in summer heat) for some and (apart from the boat service) the only way is by foot. The boat service leaves from the back of the island (near the caves and rock pools). The boat is manned by an old fishermen who manually operates the rudder. This quirky boat service operates at various times, with regular pick up services during the busy summer months (every 15 minutes) to no service or a completely unreliable service during low season or inclement weather.\n\nThere are plentiful services (cafes, restrooms, vending machines, etc.) throughout the island.\n\nDuring summer the mainland and beach areas of Enoshima city is all about sea sports; particularly surfing, sailing and jet boating.  The surf here isn't great by most standards, but during Summer it is the place to be seen for the trendy younger crowd as it is conveniently close to Tokyo, providing an excuse for tens of thousands of funky Japanese to strut around with bleached hair and chocolate-bronze skin. \n\nSummer starts 1 July and finishes end of August at area beaches. During this season there are  dozens of beach huts serving a range of average food at average prices. However, they make a great escape from the heat and a good places to appreciate the view. They also offer showers, locker & beach equipment rentals.\n\nDuring summer the sand can get very dirty with 'gomi' (garbage) littering the beach. \n\nDuring other months, the Enoshima beaches become much quieter, cleaner and peaceful. \n\nEnoshima has a big yacht harbor. Many cruisers are docked there and many university clubs have their boats moored at this spot.
