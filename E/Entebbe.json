The journey itself takes 45 minutes to 1 hour, much quicker when you avoid Kampala's chaotic rush hours. You can take the minibus in the minibus station near to the Kampala central market, with signs for every destination served. You can get off wherever you want en route, but if you ride to the bitter end, your journey will terminate at the ",{"type":"{{","value":[["marker"],["type=listing"],["name=Matatu park"],["lat=0.0566"],["long=32.4597"]]}," in Entebbe.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["mapframe"],["layer=M"],["zoom=auto"]]},"\nThere are three types of public transport: boda-bodas, matatu, and special hires. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boda-boda"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Two men on boda-boda.JPG"],["thumb"],["Boda-boda with, rather unusually, a helmeted pilot - no helmet is provided for his fearless fare, of course..."]]}," \nThe fastest and most dangerous method is the boda-boda: motorcycles that you see all over town. You won't be in Entebbe long before being propositioned by a boda rider. If you're not interested, a simple 'no' will get them to leave you alone. You can get most anywhere on the back of one for UGX2000-5000, but make sure to agree on the fare before the ride begins. Men usually ride facing forward while women are expected to ride side saddle; very risky. Females can get away with riding facing the front, but may be accused of riding \"like a man,\" though the locals are fairly understanding of female tourists doing this.\n\nBoda-bodas are extremely dangerous as their riders will do whatever it takes to get you to your destination quickly. Expect to dart in front of and against traffic and even though crowds of pedestrians when necessary. Boda-boda accidents account for most of the hospital visits and traffic fatalities in Entebbe; you have been warned!\n\nBoda-bodas got their name from the bicycle taxis that operated at some of the busy border crossing points. Buses had to discharge their passengers at the exit border control, who then had to walk to the entry border control. The distance across no man's land at some borders can be considerable. Hence the bicycle taxis would cry \"boda-boda\" (a corruption of the English \"border to border\") to the weary travellers. These bicycle taxis can still be found in most smaller Ugandan towns; however, in Entebbe, they have been replaced by motorcycles.\n\nAs boda-boda collisions are one of the most common medical concerns in Uganda, hiring a taxi from a trusted source (decent hotel, friend, or colleague recommendation) may be wiser.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By matatu"]},"\nMatatus are a series of licensed minibus \"taxi\"s that follow relatively pre-set routes all over town (and many other parts of the country). Confusingly, they are known as \"taxis\" in Uganda. It might be a bit confusing in the beginning how to use the matatus to efficiently get where you want to go, but it's really not so difficult. \n\nTheir routes usually go between the matutu park at the back of the 7Seasons Hotel and Kampala (or, more rarely, some suburb of Entebbe). \n\nMatatus will stand in the park until they are full, something that normally takes less than 15 minutes, but can take over half an hour (or even over one hour late at night or on Sundays). Matatus that leave the area around the park are hence full, which makes it difficult to hop on a matatu at other places in the town centre. Unless you're very lucky, you'll have to go to where the matatus start in order to leave the town centre.\n\nEach matatu has a driver and a conductor who opens the sliding door, takes fares and yells the destination. Don't be frightened if you can't understand what they're saying. Ask one of them for your destination and you'll be told yes or no. When you get in, expect to be squeezed. Each vehicle is licensed to carry 14 people, but they will pack in as many as will fit (and their belongings). If you don't like this, it's a good idea to sit in the back of the vehicle, since usually the squeezing is limited to the first 2 rows or, alternatively, pay double for the whole of the front seat next to the driver. Once the matatu starts moving people can get off at any time. When you reach your destination, tell your conductor \"Stage\" and they will stop the van. \n\nWhenever a matatu has empty space the driver will go slowly and honk repeatedly. If you want to get on, just make some gesture and it will slow further down and shout out the destination, just shout your destination as response and they will pick you up if it's along the way. There are often also a number of further staging points along the way where the driver will again stop and wait until they can fill the vehicle. This can take a few seconds or several minutes; just be patient. In some cases drivers won't take you if you only go relatively short distances, since that will mean they'll risk losing money if they can't fill your place quickly once you're dropped. You pay the conductor when you exit, although some people give the conductor money while the vehicle is moving so that he can make change ahead of time. The normal fare is UGX2500 per person for a trip all the way into Kampala (May 2014).\n\nGoing with a matatu is generally cheap, safe, slow and nice. Ugandans are often happy to start up a conversation or help you out, and if the conductor tries to overcharge you or make you take an inefficient route, passengers are likely to point that out to you and scold him. People also complain if a driver takes too long to wait for passengers or drives recklessly and will even collectively quit the matatu in protest if a driver drives too bad.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By special hire"]},"\nIf you aren't up for the thrill of the bodas and don't have time for a matatu, then saloon car taxis - also called special hires - are readily available near the matatu park.
