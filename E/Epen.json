First written evidence of the settlement dates back to 1041, when it is mentioned in an akt of the Roman king Hendrik under the name \"Apine\". In 1056 Hendrik, then German Emperor, gives a number of goods in \"villa Apensis\" to the abbey of Burtscheid, to which they belong until 1794. Some believe that poverty, due to the many passing armies and the effects of war, are the reason why so many timber framed houses in the area remain.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=VVV tourist information office"],["url="],["email="],["address=Julianastraat 15"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +31 900-555 9798"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=The tourist information office has a good range of maps and other information.
