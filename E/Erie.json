It is Pennsylvania's only lake port on the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Great Lakes"]]}," (Lake Erie).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nErie is the fourth largest metropolitan area in the state of Pennsylvania.  However, in terms of size and stature, there is a clear gulf between the first and second cities (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Philadelphia"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pittsburgh"]]},") and the second-tier cities, like Erie, Allentown, Scranton\/",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wilkes-Barre"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Harrisburg"]]},".  Erie is roughly in the center of Pennsylvania's only coastline, bordering Lake Erie.  The city itself sits on Presque Isle Bay, which is formed by a long, narrow peninsula known as Presque Isle that reaches from the west around the north of the city.\n\nErie was founded in 1795 after the purchase of the surrounding territory from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New York (state)"],["New York"]]},".  It made its mark on history during the early 19th century, when Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry's small fleet of warships used the bay (then known as Misery Bay) to regroup and repair between skirmishes with the British fleet on Lake Erie.  (A reconstruction of the Brig \"Niagara\" can be found at the Erie Maritime Museum.)\n\nThe late nineteenth century brought industrial development, primarily heavy equipment and the locomotive industry.  Like many other cities in the so-called rust belt, this development has slowly withered away to outside competition, with the notable exception being General Electric, which maintains a large and active presence in the rail industry (GE Rail).\n\nErie's climate is similar to most of the Northern United States, but with a big winter twist known as lake effect snow.  Snowfall amounts vary wildly within a 40 mile zone south of the lake.  Most of the time the immediate vicinity of the lake receives light snowfall, and the range from three to fifteen miles receives a whollop.  Snowfalls are also generally heavier as you go east.  The NY\/PA border region typically receives the most snow until you move far enough away from the lake for the effects to diminish.  The roads are well maintained, but some snow squalls come on so suddenly, it is impossible to keep up.  If you are driving in the winter, be prepared with emergency gear.  The good news is that by January, it is often cold enough for Lake Erie to freeze over, greatly diminishing the lake effect.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nErie is within a two hour drive of Buffalo-Niagara, Cleveland-Hopkins and Pittsburgh International Airports.

The airport is served by three major airlines: United (via Cleveland), Delta (via Detroit), and US Airways (via Philadelphia). Bargains can be had and the airport itself is a breeze to navigate, get in and out of, and also has a full compliment of car rental agencies on-site. Parking is easy, but it is also fairly pricey.

The recently completed Bayfront Connector Highway links the northern terminus of I-79 through the city along the bayfront and then through the industrial East side and newer housing and office developments around Knowledge Park and Penn State University (Behrend College).  The new highway (completed Summer 2005) is 3-4 lanes, but has few buildings or side streets that connect directly with the road, making traffic relatively smooth and making it much easier to get in and out of the downtown.

Major E\/W thoroughfares are 6th, 12th, 26th and 38th Street.  The center of town is split north-south by State Street.  N\/S streets on the west side of town are typically named after trees (Peach, Poplar, Chestnut) and on the east side after countries (French, German, Holland).  The two major north-south routes through the center of town are State and Peach (Peach diverges to the southwest after 26th street.)  Major N\/S streets listed from west to east are Pittsburgh, Greengarden, Liberty, Chestnut, Peach, State, French, Parade, East.  As you can see, this naming convention is not hard and fast, and breaks down in all directions the further you get from the city center.

All ambulatory services are served by EmergyCare.\n\nErie, for the most part, is safe, and an average tourist will have no problems with violent crime, especially in Millcreek, where the mall and other shopping areas are. The East Side, especially near lower Parade Street, can be more urban and rough, but the people are mainly working class immigrants for the most part, and will not cause a problem. Near the General Electric plant near Harborcreek, however, the depressed, formerly industrial neighbourhoods can breed much in the way of criminal activity; it's recommended that a tourist avoid these areas, although these areas do not offer much in the way of what a visitor would wish to see to begin with.\n\nPerry Square in Erie's urban core has multiple bars that are frequented on weekends by both rowdy college kids from Gannon and middle-aged professionals; one must be extremely careful when driving downtown overnight, especially after final call at 1:30AM.\n\nOther than these notes, one should just use common sense; avoid flashing expensive articles while in thickly populated areas such as downtown Erie.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chautauqua"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Buffalo (New York)"],["Buffalo"]]}," is an hour and a half east on I-90.
