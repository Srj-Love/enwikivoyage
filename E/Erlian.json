It is also variously known as Ereen or Eriyen in Mongolia, and Erenhot or Erlianhaote (二连浩特; ",{"type":"''","value":["Èrliánhàotè"]},") in China.  It appears as Erlian on Chinese railway timetables, and Ereen on Monglian railway timetables.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nThere is a direct flight Beijing-Erlian (Erenhot Shi, code ERL) via Capital Airlines, China.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nThere are trains from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beijing"]]},".

If you are doing a visa run from Beijing, find out when trains will be coming back before going to Erlian.  Train tickets can typically be purchased at the train station five days before the train is scheduled to leave, ten days during Chinese New Year (2010).  If you are traveling from Beijing to renew a visa, return tickets can not be purchased in Beijing.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nThere are sleeper buses from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beijing"]]},". (¥200, 2011)  The long-distance bus station is nearby, about one block west and 2-3 blocks north of the train station.\n\nYou can get from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zamiin-Uud"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mongolia"]]}," by bus (¥40, July 2009)\n\nThe bus station was closed for Chinese New Year until Feb. 19th (2010)\n\nYou can take a bus from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hohhot"]]},".  There are several buses each day.  Cost as of 4\/2011 is 88RMB.  Depending on the traffic the trip is about 6 hours and 30 minutes.  Bus stops for the driver to eat, but there is not much choice so bring some snacks.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By jeep"]},"\nYou can get from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zamiin-Uud"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mongolia"]]}," by jeep, which costs around ¥50 per person (July 2009).  Russian-made jeeps driven by Mongolian drivers start at the market where Mongolians buy goods to take back to Mongolia. The same jeeps also pick up passengers at the first border checkpoint with Chinese guards if they have room. At the border a jeep will arrive every few minutes.  A Chinese taxi can take you to this checkpoint for ¥5-10. The jeeps are allowed to carry 5 passengers; however, some drivers ask the Chinese guards for exceptions and carry up to 7 passengers. If taking a jeep, expect to be very crowded and to either sit on someone's lap or have someone sit on your lap. Get out of the jeep at the Chinese and Mongolian entry points and walk through. Be sure to remember which jeep is yours as they come in only two colors (grey and green) and look nearly identical to each other. Many Mongolians cross the border on a daily basis so they are familiar with the process and can help out. Many speak at least some English.\n\nYou are not allowed to walk between the Chinese and Mongolian border posts though they are within walking distance. You will need to pay a ¥5 exit tax. The whole process takes around 1.5 hours.\n\nBe prepared that on some holidays (e. g. 1 June, Childrens Day), the border is closed and you may be forced to stay a day longer than prepared. It may happen that a driver still offers you a lift, then notices at the border that it isn't possible and still wants to charge you for it.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nTaxis, pedicabs and rickshaws are everywhere.  A taxi around town costs ¥5 flat rate or ¥10 to the border from town (February 2010).

The CITS will be on the left hand corner.  Turn right here, then walk straight ahead for about five minutes. When you get to Chichaer St you will see the beige bus station down the street on the left, but continue walking straight ahead for a about another ten minutes until you see the blue, red and yellow Mongolian flag on the left. Do not worry if it seems like you have walked a bit outside town, you are meant to. Go to the small office at the gate.\n\nDuring Chinese new year, the border (18 Feb) and the Mongolian Consulate (22 Feb) were both closed. (2010)\n\nOne Australian was able to obtain a visa at the border while the consulate in town was closed during Chinese New Year but this process did not seem to be encouraged and may not be typically available.\n\nFor residents of Beijing, a trip to Erlian is the cheapest way to leave the country and renew a multiple entry visa (a visa run) but is less straight forward than a trip to Hong Kong or Seoul, Korea.  Most people in town and at the border do not speak any English so some basic Chinese is very helpful. \n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=Trans-Siberian Railway icon.png"],["imagesize1=100"],["directionl1=N"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Irkutsk"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ulaanbaatar"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["lfarrow"]]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zamiin-Uud"]]}],["directionr1=S"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beijing"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hohhot"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Central Inner Mongolia"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Erenhot"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["43.648"],["111.973"]]}]
