Insect repellent is also a good idea, particularly for the return portion of the trail.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["0.0"]}," Walk past the front entrance of the restaurant at (1).  The trail starts at (2).  This area is riddled with lots of trails, many of which are predominantly used for cross-country skiing.  There are two marked hiking trails that start here, the Esker Trail and the Lime Kiln Trail.  Both follow the same path initially.  While there are many trail intersections, the Esker Trail is easy to follow, with a distinctive yellow sign pointing you in the right direction at every junction.\n\nAfter a short portion of grassy trail which may require dodging around some parked horse-drawn sleds, the trail joins a wide dirt horse trail.

At (4) ",{"type":"'''","value":["0.8"]},", the esker and lime kiln trails split, with the esker trail veering left.  As with all junctions, this one is well marked.\n\nAt ",{"type":"'''","value":["2.5"]}," you reach a clearing.  There is an outhouse (5) and a warming hut used by skiers in the winter.

Interpretive signs at the base of the tower and at the top explain the geology of the area and point out sights that may be visible from the top.  It appears that the surrounding trees have grown up substantially since the tower was constructed, and much of the view is now obscured.  Bird's Hill is the highest point within 30 km, rising 30 metres above the surrounding prairie.\n\nReturn to (5) and take the trail to the left. The trail descends steeply and enters darker, denser forest where insects are more likely.
