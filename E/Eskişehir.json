Enveriye station, on the other hand, is linked to city centre by minibuses (operating until midnight) which drive along the nearby street. However, most trains with a stop at Enveriye arrive after midnight, so your best bet is to take a taxi if you want to avoid the 30–40 minutes walk to the city centre.\n\nFrom Istanbul’s Asian station (Haydarpaşa), you can find several trains heading for either station every day (In fact, any passenger train departing from Haydarpaşa, except the suburban trains and regional expresses which head for nearby Adapazarı, passes through and stops in Eskişehir). Price depends on the speed of trains and ranges between roughly TRY10 (the cheapest) and TRY20 (the most expensive). 20% discount for students is possible in every train. Unlike many other examples in Turkey, rail travel between Istanbul and Eskişehir generally takes the same or less time than bus travel (it takes between 4 and 6 hours, depending on the train). The train ride from Istanbul is quite scenic, especially when the tracks traverse the shores of Lake Sapanca and go through the rocky and verdant valley of Sakarya River.\n\nAnkara is connected to the central station of Eskişehir by a recently started ",{"type":"'''","value":["high speed train"]}," service (",{"type":"''","value":["YHT"]},") seven times a day (which takes 1h 20min and costs TRY25), in addition to a wide number of conventional trains (which are mostly heading for Istanbul, İzmir, or other cities to the west of Ankara via Eskişehir).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nThe city is 335 km away from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Istanbul"]]},", 228 km from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ankara"]]},", and 144 km from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bursa"]]},".\n\nEskişehir lies on the highway ",{"type":"'''","value":["D200\/E90"]},", which connects Bursa, a major city in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Marmara (region)"],["northwest"]]},", with Ankara, the national capital.
