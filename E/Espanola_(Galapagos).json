The beach considered an open area where you are free to explore and view land iguanas.\n\nSnorkeling at Gardner Bay is fantastic. This is often your first chance to swim with the Sea Lions and this is an opportunity not to be missed. Further out towards Tortuga Rock and Gardner Island schools of large colorful tropical fish including yellow tailed surgeon fish, king angelfish and bump-head parrot fish swim along with an occasional Manta Ray gliding by and white-tipped sharks napping on the bottom.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Underwater sites"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Islote Gardner"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Galapagos hawk (juv).jpg"],["thumb"],["A juvenile Galapagos Hawk"]]},"\n\nThis small island in front of Gardner Bay is lined with vertical cliffs that drop to sandy ledges and large boulders.  Diving here you will encounter the smallest of the Galapagos garden eels, snake eels, blackspot morays, Galapagos putterfish, scorpionfish, and red-lipped batfish.  On the north end of the island are twisting tunnels and to the south are caves making for interesting exploration.  The area has an abundance of fish including schools of snappers, creolefish, king angelfish, butterflyfish, jacks, large pufferfish and a variety of sea urchins and sea stars.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Bajo Gardner"]},"\n\nNormally the second dive at Española begins at the sea mount.  Here contrasting Islote Gardner you will find some of the largest and least timid of the Galapagos garden eels. Tiger eels and red-lipped batfish are also common. Frequent encounters include eagle rays, hammerheads, schools of snappers, brightly colored peacock flounders, moray eels, whitetips, morays, king angel fish, creolefish, yellowtail surgeons, large Spanish hogfish, flag cabrillos and Panama graysbys.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\nThe nearest islands are:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Floreana"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["San Cristobal (Galapagos)"],["San Cristobal"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Española Island"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["-1.3667"],["-89.6833"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Galapagos Islands"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Española"]]}]
