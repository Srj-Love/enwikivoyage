Though still a fine paper town, Espanola is now renowned for it's picturesque wilderness, lakes, fishing, camping, hiking and golfing opportunities.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["History"]},"\nThe story of how Espanola got its name dates back to the 18th century where an Ojibwe tribe went out on a raid far away and brought back a Caucasian woman who spoke Spanish.  This woman was said to have married into a First Nations family and taught her children to speak her mother tongue. Later, when French voyageurs would make their way to the mouth of the river they were surprised to hear bits of Spanish spoken by the local natives. Thus giving the town the name “Espagnole” which was later anglicized to “Espanola”.  The river was subsequently then called the Spanish River.\n  \nThe town of Espanola was founded in the early 1900s for the employees of the Spanish River Pulp and Paper Company.  The town soon populated and housed a hotel, school and theatre.  A couple decades later the mill was closed during the Great Depression and was rendered a ghost town.  During the war Espanola was used as a German prisoner camp and later reopened and produced paper once again.  Throughout the years the pulp and paper mill has become committed to lessening their environmental impact.\nThe 1969 CBC Television series Adventures in Rainbow Country was filmed near Espanola, close to the small First Nations community of Birch Island and at Whitefish Falls.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nEspanola can be reached by car by traveling east from Sault Ste Marie or west from Sudbury on Highway 17, then south on Provincial route 6 for 2 miles.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nEspanola is accessible by car but the best part of it all is that it is accessible to anyone by foot or by paddle along the Spanish River.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nEspanola is renowned for its picturesque wilderness, lakes, fishing, camping, hiking and golfing opportunities.
