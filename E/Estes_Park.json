It is located 90 miles northwest of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Denver"]]},", on the eastern slope of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Front Range"]]}," in north central ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Colorado"]]},". Estes Park sits at the east entrance to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rocky Mountain National Park"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n\"Park\" in this case is a term that means a valley or meadow.  Estes Park is named after an early settler, Joel Estes, who attempted to make a living by farming.  Because of the short growing season it never really worked out.  Since the mid-1800s the main business of Estes Park has been tourism.  The clientele ranges from hard-core backcountry types to tour-buses full of drive through sightseers.  The main draw is the scenery, which is awesome.\n\nYear-round population is approximately 6,000 people, adding the surroundings it may be 10,000.  In the peak of tourist season that probably triples.  The best time to visit for outdoor activities is July through September. Everyone else thinks so too, so it can get kind of crowded.  The heaviest traffic is probably in August.  The family\/kids crowd thins out after Labor Day.\n\nWinter is a charming time of the year as well, since it is an excellent time to go snow shoeing and cross country skiing.  Winter also provides greater opportunities to enjoy the tranquility of the Rocky Mountains as there are fewer tourists.\n\nWinter weather is warmer than most mountain towns.  But summer is also short.  Summer temps peak in the low 90's(F) in town, much cooler as elevation increases.  If you plan on spending any time out of your car up on Trail Ridge Road take a jacket.  Estes is in a dry zone, getting maybe 13-15 inches of moisture a year.  During the summer the regular weather pattern is clear mornings with a buildup of clouds at midday and sometimes a short rain shower.\n\nElevation in town is 7,522 feet above sea level.  Some people experience discomforts due to altitude.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\n4 main routes:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" West from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Loveland (Colorado)"],["Loveland"]]},", CO via US-34, approximately 30 miles"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Northwest from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lyons"]]},", CO via US-36 approximately 25 miles"]},{"type":"*","value":[" North from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Golden (Colorado)"],["Golden"]]}," \/ ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Black Hawk"]]}," \/ ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Central City"]]}," \/ ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boulder"]]}," through ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Allenspark"]]},", CO via CO-7 "]},{"type":"*","value":[" East from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Grand Lake"]]},", CO via US-34 over Trail Ridge Road through ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rocky Mountain National Park"]]},".

Shuttle service to Estes can be obtained (see ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.estesparkshuttle.com\/"]}," or ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.estesparklimo.com\/airport.html"]},").\n\nThere are small airports in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boulder"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Longmont"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Loveland (Colorado)"],["Loveland"]]},"\/",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fort Collins"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nGetting around Estes Park has become easier in recent years.  The town itself is small and can be covered reasonably well by walking.  Most tourist visitors have their own car.  You can park in one of the city lots (free) and walk a couple of blocks to get downtown.\n\nEstes Park has implemented a free shuttle bus system ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/estesparkcvb.com\/estesparkcvb\/photos\/textboxes\/Shuttle_Map_4_25_No_Times.pdf"]}," that begins at the Visitor Center and has stops in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rocky Mountain National Park"]]}," as well as a variety of stops within town.\n\nThere is some provision for bicycles.  Paved trails radiate out from Lake Estes toward the south and west.  But the part of the trail that goes downtown is restricted to walking only.  Cycling on the main roads is OK, but shoulders can be sparse.  Be careful of \"tourist drivers\" who will perform strange unpredictable maneuvers.\n\nThere is a local taxi-cab company ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.peaktopeaktaxi.com\/"]},", but do not depend on this as your only transportation option to get around the town as it is inconsistent at best.\n\nTransport within the National Park is mostly by private vehicle but shuttle bus service between the Moraine Park \/ Bear Lake areas has become more popular in recent years.  Shuttle bus service between the Estes Park Visitors Center and Rocky Mountain National Park started in 2006.  While the shuttle bus is free, you will need to purchase a National Parks pass prior to entering Rocky Mountain National Park.  According to the Visitor's Center staff, there is an automated machine available at the Visitor's Center from which you can purchase 7-day or annual passes.\n\nHitchhiking can sometimes be effective particularly if you look like you are making an effort and have good personal hygiene.  Speaking of hygiene, the laundromat in upper Stanley village also sells showers.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The neighboring ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rocky Mountain National Park"]]},", particularly the drive over Trail Ridge Road."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Wildlife: elk (wapiti), bighorn sheep, mule deer, etc."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Fine arts\/galleries"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Historical museum"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nMost visitors to town are here for the nature, and activities such as camping, hiking, fishing, horse riding, mountain climbing (in particular, Longs Peak), birding and rafting are very popular.

Options also exist for those looking for t-shirts and \"rubber tomahawks\".\n\nFor groceries it's Country Market or Safeway and prices are comparable to the front range area.  Car\/RV service, parts and repair are available but somewhat limited.  Gas prices are usually 10 cents\/gal higher than Loveland or Longmont.
