It's located in the centre of the country, where the rivers Sauer, Wark and Alzette meet. This practical location has made Ettelbruck a major junction and transport hub, both historically and today. Although this friendly place doesn't have any of the impressive sites some other cities in Luxembourg have, it makes for a fine base from where to explore this compact country.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Tourist Information Office"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address=5, rue Abbé Muller"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Mo-Fri 10AM-5PM"],["price="],["content=Located on the church square, between \"Le Resto\" and the \"Schumacher\" bakery."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nEttelbruck is easily reachable by car, as it lies along the A7 Motorway (sometimes called the Motorway of the North).\n\nBy train it's equally well-connected, as it serves as a major railway junction.

Patton Memorial Museum, opened in 1995. It's a tribute to the American army General Patton, a folk hero and famous for quotes  like \"No bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. You won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country\". Although the general himself never set foot in Ettelbruck, the town promotes itself as \"Patton town\", and he is widely celebrated as the Ettelbruck's liberator and symbol for the victory over the Germans in 1944. \nThe central square is named after him, and in July, there's the annual Remembrance Day celebration, in honour of him and the American, British, French, Belgian and of course Luxembourgish troops who fought in the region. There's also a memorial for the celebrated general. Both the square and the memorial are located along the Sure-bridge, right at the spot where the Allied Forces finally succeeded to stop the German advancements into the south.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=George S.
