As the number of applications per match exceeded the size of the stadiums and there was an overwhelming number of ticket buyers, UEFA held a random draw.\n\nAround 20% of tickets for each game was distributed by the national football associations of the 16 countries that qualified for the tournament. This phase took place in February\/March 2008 and after that the tickets are virtually sold out (i.e. they are only available from unofficial sources for a price around 20 times higher than the original one). However, it is reasonable to expect tickets to be available from touts at the stadiums right before the game as this happens on most tournaments like this.
