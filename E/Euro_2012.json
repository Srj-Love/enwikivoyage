Tickets for this service will become available via the Internet from May 1. \n\nSeventeen trains will be added to the Ukraine-Poland service between for the duration of the tournament, with tickets on sale from March.\n\nPolish trains have diverse standards. Express trains are of the highest standard, while the regional & slower trains mostly date back to the Soviet era. Both Express and Regional are divided into first and second class carriages, though you may want to consider first class tickets, as the price difference between the second and first class is not so big. The jump in comfort may be substantial but then it is also common to see trains where 2nd class carriages are recently renovated and 1st class carriages are old and correspondingly low quality. Intercity trains and many express trains have a separate restaurant car, with some also having special smoking compartments. Long-distance trains are often equipped with additional sleeping-cars.\n\nThe Polish road network contains fewer highways and more ordinary two-lane roads than is common in western countries, and is in general of low quality. A lot of these roads are far below capacity for the volume of traffic they are carrying and the average quality of the road surface is poor. All vehicles are required to use headlights, night and day, all year round.\n\nYou must possess a valid International Driving Licence to drive legally in Ukraine. You must have original vehicle-registration papers, ownership documents and insurance papers available at all times. These will be required when crossing borders and if you are stopped by the police when driving. This is also valid for rental vehicles.  If you do not have these papers when stopped by the police they have the right to impound your vehicle and charge you for this.\n\nUkrainian law allows the police to stop a vehicle. The police officer should give their name and rank, explain the reason why you have been stopped and make an administrative offence report in the case of a traffic violation. Fines have to be paid at a bank within fifteen days. There is a zero tolerance policy on drink driving.  Road conditions in Ukraine, especially in rural areas, can often be extremely hazardous, especially at night. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Host Cities"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Varšava, Śródmieście, Rynek Starego Miasta.JPG"],["thumb"],["right"],["200px"],["Warsaw's picturesque ",{"type":"''","value":["Old Town Square"]}," at dusk."]]},"\nThe following eight cities will be hosting all the matches for the tournament.
