Western Europe for the most part has good road conditions and an extensive and well developed highway network, whereas Eastern Europe is still working hard on the large backlog left from communist days. \n\nDuring vacations, especially summer and Christmas vacations, driving on the motorways (highways) can be hellish, particularly in Germany (listen for the word ",{"type":"''","value":["Stau"]},", meaning congestion, in the automated traffic broadcasts). \n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Road rules"]},"\nThe traffic is right-handed, except in United Kingdom, Ireland, Isle of Man, Guernsey, Jersey, Malta and Cyprus (there is no land border with change of handedness). For the left-hand countries any references to right or left below might be reversed.\n\nThere are no uniform speed limits across the union. The fabled limitless German Autobahn is now confined to mostly rural sections. The majority of motorways\/freeways have a 110–130 km\/h (70–80 mph) speed limit, while the limit on undivided highways varies between 80 and 100 km\/h (50–65 mph). For North Americans, a major difference is the left lane on motorways, which is not the \"fast lane\" you're used to, but rather the \"passing lane\". It's illegal to overtake on the right, so you should only occupy the outer lane when you are overtaking someone; stay there, and you will have other vehicles tailgating while flashing their lights in annoyance and traffic police eager to fine you. Remember to use turn signals when changing lanes. \n\nExcept for priority streets (check the symbol in the table) there is a general duty to give way to traffic from your right in crossings and intersections that are not marked, and other drivers have every expectation you adhere to this. This also applies to unmarked T-intersections, unlike in North America, England, Australia, Japan and most other places where the ending road should normally yield to the through road even if unmarked. But in the ubiquitous roundabouts (circles) you find everywhere across the continent, cars already in the circle always have the right of way; don't give way to incoming drivers while in the roundabout, or you will mess up the system, potentially causing a nasty accident. Finally, don't do right turns on red lights (unless for example, in Germany the light features a green right arrow sign, in which case right turning right on red is permitted, but important to note, only after coming to a dead stop first, otherwise a $120 fine can be charged despite you having arrived in the country that day), it's illegal, and because it's not common practice, also dangerous.\n\nMarkings and signs are similar throughout Europe but variations in design and interpretations exist so it may be very practical to research each country individually before you travel.

So for the most part it may be a slow, frustrating and potentially dangerous experience, and even then, finding a parking spot can potentially take a long time and cost several euros when you find it. Streets in the old city centres also tend to be very narrow and difficult to drive on. Instead park on the outskirts of town, where it is often free, and use the (usually extensive) public transit system instead. If you are renting, try to \"work around having a car\" while visiting large cities. \n\nIf you plan to rent a car to drive around Europe, it often makes sense to check the rates in different countries rather than just hire a car in the country of arrival. The price differences can be substantial for longer rentals, to the extent that it can make sense to adjust your travel plans accordingly, e.g. if you plan on travelling around Scandinavia by car, it will often be much cheaper to fly into Germany and rent a car there. Compared to North America, you should be prepared for smaller, more efficient cars, and most of them have manual transmission, so don't expect an automatic without requesting one when placing your order (and often paying extra). \n\nIn any case driving in Europe is an ",{"type":"'''","value":["expensive"]}," proposition – petrol (gas) prices hover around €1.30–1.80 per litre ($6.50–9 per US gallon) in much of Europe, while often somewhat cheaper in Russia.

Highway tolls are very common, city centre congestion charges increasingly so, and even parking can work up to €50 ($70) per day in the most expensive cities.

The few \"trouble areas\" to avoid are the run-down suburbs of certain urban areas (particularly in Europe's largest cities); some places in eastern and southern Europe do have much higher violent crime rates and can be very dangerous for non locals, but these areas shouldn't be of interest to the average tourist. Central and Western Europe are generally the safest regions. \n\nEurope may be very urban and densely populated in general but as always when traveling in rural and forested \/ mountainous areas take the proper precautions.

If you are used to free healthcare in your own country, remember that some member states expect patients to pay towards their treatment, and you may be expected to do the same. And do remember that the EHIC does not equal a travel insurance; it doesn't cover private healthcare, the cost of mountain rescues or repatriation to your home country. Neither does it allow you to go abroad specifically to receive medical care.\n\nIf you are not an EU\/EEA citizen, remember to buy a travel insurance policy, while some countries do provide free emergency care for visitors, any follow-up treatment and repatriation is your own responsibility, and some countries expect you to foot the entire bill for any treatment yourself – the fabled universal healthcare system does not equal free treatment for non EU citizens.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\nFor emergencies you can dial ",{"type":"'''","value":["112"]}," in any EU member nation as well as most other European countries – even when it is not the primary local number for emergency services.
