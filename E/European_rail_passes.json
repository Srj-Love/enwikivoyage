This makes it a great way to get a feel for a large region, especially when heading out into the countryside.  Do not, however, fall into the trap of traveling so continuously that all you see is a blur of railway stations.\n\nRail passes work just like tickets.

In peak season on popular routes seat reservations are definitely worthwhile.\n\nIf travelling overnight, the token fees for couchettes (usually less than €20) are well worth the price.  \n\nHigh-speed trains such as TGV, Thalys, ICE (only lines to France), Eurostar Italia, Cisalpino, X2000, AVE and Talgo 200, may require pass holders to pay supplements.

Using it is very easy: whenever you board a train, write down date and time, where you're going from, where you're going to, seat or couchette, and the train number.  When the conductors come to check tickets, show them the pass and they'll (usually) stamp that row.  That's it!
