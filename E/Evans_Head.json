Most of them are bored-not looking for trouble however be mindful of where you are and who is around. Whilst violent crime is rare there is occasionally vandalism and petty theft perpetrated by these groups.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe town is serviced by a daily CountryLink Coach from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Casino"]]},", connecting with the train. There are also infrequent commuter buses provided by Buslines group to Grafton, Lismore and Ballina. If entering by road there are two ways into the town, both leading from the Pacific Highway. One leaves the small village of Woodburn, the other leaves from the small village of Broadwater. All 3 are approximately 10 km away from each other. In effect the roads form a triangle facing the Pacific Ocean, with Evans head at its apex, the Broadwater-Evans Head road forming the northern side, the Evans Head-Woodburn road forming its southern side and the Pacific Highway forming the western side.\n\nNote that the locals travel quickly along the roads into town-particularly the Broadwater road. Feel free to slow down somewhat if you don't feel comfortable doing 100 km\/h. The Woodburn road has an 80 km\/h speed limit and has much more access points-driveways, local roads, etc.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe town itself is very compact so walking or a bicycle should suffice.\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThere are some nice lookouts on the south side of town.\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nSwim at the beach. There is a beach on both the river and ocean. The ocean beach is occasionally patrolled.\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nThere are basic shops at the town, including 2 groceries, several takeaway food shops and a smattering of other shops and services. The shops are mainly utilitarian in purpose however.

Holiday rentals are popular-see the local real estates for more information. There are several motels in nearby Woodburn and Evans Head that may also be of interest\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nThe road to Broadwater passes through a national park and may have wildlife on it during the evenings and nights so caution is advised. Take it slow and you should be alright, or alternatively travel via Woodburn. There is still a risk of some wildlife however the road passes through farmland and is fenced at least.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Northern Rivers"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Evans Head, New South Wales"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["-29.116666666667"],["153.43333333333"]]}]
