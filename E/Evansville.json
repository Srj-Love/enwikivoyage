Evansville is the third-largest city in the U.S. state of Indiana and the largest city in Southern Indiana. As of the 2010 census, the city had a total population of 117,429. In 2008 a population estimate put the Evansville Metropolitan Statistical Area at 350,261.\n\nSettled in 1812, the city is situated on a gentle horseshoe bend on the Ohio River and often referred to as \"River City.\" One of the most popular attractions in the region is Tropicana Evansville (formerly Casino Aztar, the first riverboat casino in the state of Indiana). Evansville is also home to both the University of Evansville and the University of Southern Indiana.\n\nThe broad economic base of the region has helped to build an economy which is known for its stability, diversity, and vitality. In 2004 Evansville was named an \"All-America City\" by the National Civic League. In 2008 it was voted the best city in the country in which \"to live, work, and play\" by the readers of Kiplinger, and in 2009 the 11th best.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Evansville_Indiana_-_Greyhound_Bus_Station.jpg"],["thumb"],["Evansville Indiana - Greyhound Bus Station"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Evansville Regional Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["EVV"]]},"), ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.evvairport.com"]},".

The strong economic base provided by giant Toyota and AK Steel plants has allowed the city to thrive in the face of the nationwide recession.
