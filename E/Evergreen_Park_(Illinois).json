The population at the time was approximately 500 people. Fifty-one residents turned out on December 20, 1893 when forty of them voted for incorporation and four squared miles of area became the Village of Evergreen Park. Many of the original settlers were hard working farm families.\n\nThe Village acquired its name from the park located at 97th Street and Homan Avenue, originally intended to be the center of town. This part of the village was laid out to resemble Paris, with its wagon wheel appearance, but development in other directions has since caused it to be a residential section. The center of Evergreen Park is now 95th Street and Kedzie Avenue. From those few early settlers in the 1800's through the pre-war years of truck gardens, the post–war years and population boom of the 1950’s, to its present stature as one of the leading southwest suburbs of Cook County, Evergreen Park continues to progress and flourish.\n\nThe 75th Anniversary was celebrated in 1968 and the 100th Anniversary was celebrated in 1993. Time capsules were buried at each of these ceremonies and will be opened in the year 2018. Evergreen Park is a residential suburb located astride 95th Street (U.S. Route 12 and U.S. Route 20) adjacent to the attractive Beverly Hills section of Chicago and seventeen miles southwest of the Loop. The Village encompasses an area of approximately four square miles and is bordered by the City of Chicago on the north, south and east, and by the Village of Oak Lawn on the west. Evergreen Park is known as the \"Village of Churches\" as evidenced by the thirteen established religious congregations serving the community.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nWhile Evergreen Park itself does not have an airport, it is located just 7 miles from Midway International Airport.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nFrom I-294:\n\nTake 95th St exit  (US-20 E \/ US-12 E) toward OAK LAWN East to Kedzie (approximately 5.33 miles).\nTurn left onto Kedzie\n\nFrom the South:\n\nTake Bishop Ford Fwy. \/ I-94 W.\nMerge onto I-57 S via EXIT 63 on the left toward Memphis.\nTake Exit 357 toward IL-1 \/ Halsted St.\nTurn slight left onto W 98th Pl.\nTurn right onto S Halsted St \/ IL-1 N.\nContinue to follow S Halsted St.\nTurn left onto W 95th St. \/ US-20 W \/ US-12 W.\nTurn right onto S Kedzie Ave.\n\nFrom Midway Airport:\n\nSouth on S Cicero Ave \/ IL-50 S toward W 59th St.\nContinue to follow IL-50 S.\nTurn left onto W 87th St.\nTurn right onto S Kedzie Ave.\n\nFrom O'Hare Airport:\n\nTake I-190 East for 1.5 miles.

In Evergreen's early years, there were tournaments with leading amateurs and exhibitions by big-name players, including Horton Smith, first winner of the Masters. In addition to the course, there was a restaurant called Beverly Gardens located on the grounds. Beverly Gardens operated as a speakeasy and in 1921 there was a Prohibition-era raid that netted 20 arrests, including Anna Ahern. In 1933, the Ahern's hired Vincent Gebhardi as the head pro. He was better known as Jack “Machine Gun” McGurn, Al Capone’s No. 1 hit man and likely mastermind of the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre. Gebhardi was arrested while playing in the 1933 Western Open at Olympia Fields and spent six months in jail. Later in 1933, the Aherns were awaken by gunfire and discovered that John Dillinger and his henchmen were trying to rob the Gardens. Two of Dillinger's men were shot as well as two country patrolmen, however no one was fatally injured and Dillinger's men all got away. The course eventually passed to Anna and Owen's daughter, Anna May \"Babe\" Ahern. Babe, as everyone called her, was born in 1907 and recently passed away on December 12, 2010 at the age of 103. She grew up on the grounds of the course and later managed it for decades, although she was always reluctant to speak with reporters, or anyone, about the occurrences at the course. It is believed that she may have met Al Capone and other prominent outlaws of the Prohibition-era."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Circle Park"],["url="],["email="],["address=3450 West 97th Street, Evergreen Park, IL 60805"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +1 708  229-3373"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content= Circle Park is to Evergreen Park what Central Park is to New York.
