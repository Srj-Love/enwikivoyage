A historic mid-sized cathedral city with a good blend of arts, education, retail and history.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nIn AD 50 a Roman military base was built at a strategic crossing point on the banks of the river Exe, seven years after the main Roman invasion of Britain. The settlement quickly gained in importance as the administrative centre for the Dunmommi tribe once the legionnaires left. Indeed, it's Roman name, Isca Dumnomiorum, means \"town of the Dumnonii (Devonian) tribe\". Parts of the original Roman walls can still be seen today. The city continued to hold regional significance through the turbulent Dark Ages, being twice captured by the invading Vikings. Following the Norman Conquest, the inhabitants rebelled against William the Conqueror, who laid siege and subsequently built Rougemount Castle to ensure future compliance. During the renaissance period it developed into an economically powerful city through the wool industry, and a period of rapid growth commenced. Later, at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, industry was driven by water power from the River Exe. It remained a significant seaport (courtesy of its Ship Canal) until the age of steam, but there was no major industrialisation in the later 19th century. The city was badly damaged in an incendiary bombing raid on the High Street and surrounding areas in 1942, and although post-war reconstruction has been limited, a number of interesting buildings remain.\n\nNow Exeter is the commercial and service centre for a largely agricultural hinterland, with a population of around 110,000. Good facilities for tourists exist, but tourism does not dominate; regularly voted among the top 3 cities in the UK for quality of life.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nUK Domestic flights operated by ",{"type":"''","value":["flybe"]}," to Exeter International Airport are available from the following destinations:\n",{"type":"*","value":["Aberdeen (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["ABZ"]]},")"]},{"type":"*","value":["Belfast City (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["BHD"]]},")"]},{"type":"*","value":["Edinburgh (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["EDI"]]},")"]},{"type":"*","value":["Glasgow (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["GLA"]]},")"]},{"type":"*","value":["Guernsey (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["GCI"]]},")"]},{"type":"*","value":["Jersey (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["JER"]]},")"]},{"type":"*","value":["Leeds Bradford (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["LBA"]]},")"]},{"type":"*","value":["Manchester (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["MAN"]]},")"]},{"type":"*","value":["Newcastle (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["NCL"]]},")"]},{"type":"*","value":["Norwich (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["NWI"]]},")"]},"\nSkybus also operates services to and from St. Mary's - Scilly Isles (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["ISC"]]},") during the summer.\n\nInternational flights to Exeter operated by flybe are available from the following destinations, with services from France under a codeshare agreement with Air France (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["AF"]]},"):\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["Alicante (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["ALC"]]},")"]},{"type":"*","value":["Amsterdam (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["AMS"]]},")"]},{"type":"*","value":["Avignon (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["AVG"]]},")"]},{"type":"*","value":["Bergerac (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["EGC"]]},")"]},{"type":"*","value":["Chambéry (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["CMF"]]},")"]},{"type":"*","value":["Dublin (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["DUB"]]},")"]},{"type":"*","value":["Dubrovnik (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["DVK"]]},")"]},{"type":"*","value":["Düsseldorf (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["DUS"]]},")"]},{"type":"*","value":["Geneva (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["GVA"]]},") "]},{"type":"*","value":["Hanover (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["HAN"]]},")"]},{"type":"*","value":["Helsinki (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["HEL"]]},")"]},{"type":"*","value":["Málaga (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["AGP"]]},")"]},{"type":"*","value":["Palma (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["PMI"]]},")"]},{"type":"*","value":["Paris (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["CDG"]]},")"]},{"type":"*","value":["Rennes (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["RNS"]]},")"]},{"type":"*","value":["Salzburg (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["SZG"]]},")"]},"\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.airtransat.co.uk\/en\/index.aspx Air Transat"]}," also operates a scheduled service to Toronto, Canada.
