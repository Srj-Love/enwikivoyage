Land is mainly used for livestock, although there are some areas which are cultivated such as the Brendon Hills. \n\nSheep have grazed on the moors for more than 3000 years and traditional breeds include Exmoor Horn, Cheviot and Whiteface Dartmoor and Greyface Dartmoor sheep. Devon red cattle are also farmed in the area.\n\nExmoor ponies can be seen roaming freely on the moors. They are a race rather than a breed of pony, and are the closest breed remaining in Europe to Wild Horses. The ponies are rounded up once a year to be marked and checked over.\n\nRed deer have a stronghold on the moor and can be seen on quiet hillsides in remote areas, particularly in the early morning.\n\nThe famous ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beast of Exmoor"]]}," is reputed to haunt the moor, with many sightings since the 1960s. It is possibly a Cougar or Black Leopard which was released sometime in the 1960s or 1970s after a law passed making it illegal for them to be kept in captivity outside zoos. It has been blamed for many sheep kills over the years.\n\nThe moorland habitat is also home to hundreds of species of birds and insects. Birds seen on the moor include Merlin, Buzzard, Peregrine Falcon, Eurasian Curlew, European Stonechat, Dipper, Dartford Warbler and Ring Ouzel.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Boat"]},"\nThere will be a new boat service from Swansea to nearby ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ilfracombe"]]}," to the west, starting in Easter 2010.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Villages"]},"\nVillages below are in the county of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Somerset (England)"],["Somerset"]]}," unless otherwise stated.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"''","value":["Brendon'"]}," (Devon) - in 'Lorna Doone' country."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Dulverton"]]}]}," - a large and attractive village on the ",{"type":"'''","value":["River Barle"]},"."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Dunster"]]}]}," - retains a central yarn market building and has a castle above the village."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Lynton and Lynmouth"]}," (Devon) - hillside and coastal villages with a funicular between them."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Oare"]}," - centre of 'Lorna Doone' country, where Carver Doone shot Lorna in the church on her wedding day with John Ridd."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Porlock"]}," - large village with picturesque houses."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Porlock Weir"]}," - delightful coastal village and the start of a superb 5 mile cliff walk to ",{"type":"'''","value":["Culbone Church"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Selworthy"]}," - tiny but one of the most striking.
