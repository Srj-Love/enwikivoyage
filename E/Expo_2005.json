While tickets can also be purchased ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/expo1.jtb.co.jp\/eng\/ online"]},", there is little point to doing so as the price is the same, you still need to queue up to exchange it for a physical ticket, and online tickets cannot be used to make reservations.\n\nThe Expo is open from 9:00 to 22:00 daily, although some sections (notably the Seto Area) and pavilions may close earlier.  The Nagakute Area is well lit and even more surreal-looking after dusk.\n\nDue to unexpectedly high attendance the site is often horrendously overcrowded, especially on weekends. It's best to arrive very early in the morning, at least an hour before opening. The maximum capacity of the site is 170,000 people per day, and more tickets have been sold than can be accommodated in the remaining days of the exhibition. The organizers have announced that they may be forced to hold people at the entry gates, and in some cases turn them away entirely (and they have made it clear that they will ",{"type":"'''","value":["not"]}," offer refunds). Electronic signs near the entry gates and scattered around the site offer a summary of the crowd conditions and estimated wait times at the various pavilions.\n\nThe sheer size of the Expo means that it is impossible to cover everything in one day, and access to some of the more popular events and pavilions is capacity controlled with several rather convoluted systems.  Allow at least two days if you wish to visit all pavilions of interest.  It is wise to choose in advance which of the high-profile sites you want to visit and get them reserved early, then fill in the gaps with the more low-key attractions.  Lines tend to shorten as the Expo approaches closing time, although if you cut it too close you run the risk of not getting in at all.\n\nMany of the more popular pavilions have a ",{"type":"'''","value":["reservation"]}," (予約 ",{"type":"''","value":["yoyaku"]},") system, which let you choose the time of entry.  Unfortunately, due to the huge volume of visitors the system has broken down somewhat. The original intent was to allow you to make up to two of these reservations in advance ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www-2.expo2005.or.jp\/en\/ticket\/reservation.html online"]}," at least 2 days (and a maximum of one month) before you go; however, all reservations are consumed within minutes of becoming available, a month before they can be used. Since the expo runs until the end of September, as of the end of August you should expect all advance reservations to be taken.\n\nInexplicably, advance reservations require possession of a physical ticket... ",{"type":"''","value":["you cannot make reservations with an online advance ticket"]},". Some travel agencies in the United State and elsewhere, especially those that specialize in trips to Japan, stock a small number of actual tickets.\n\nFor some pavilions, it is possible to make a single same-day reservation from special machines ",{"type":"''","value":["located in front of the pavilion you wanted to visit"]}," after entry into the Expo, at least 2 hours before desired time of entry.   Usually all reserved spaces are used up by 10 AM or even earlier, although some pavilions have a second round of distribution in the afternoon.  However, the extremely popular Hitachi exhibit, for example, now allows the reservation machines to be used only by the elderly and handicapped. \n\nIf you can't get a ticket you can still queue at the pavilions to get in — expect long waits, however. Most pavilions display signs at the end of the line that tell you how long you should expect to wait. The estimates are fairly accurate and often discouraging. Waits of 30-60 minutes are common, and the most popular attractions may not allow queued visitors until late in the day; at the Hitachi pavilion, for example, queued visitors are only allowed in beginning at 5 PM... and the line starts to form at about 2 PM.\n\nSome of the most popular sights including the Toyota Pavilion and the Global House Mammoth show operate with a ",{"type":"'''","value":["numbered ticket"]}," (整理券 ",{"type":"''","value":["seiriken"]},") system, distributed only on site at set times, instead of using ticketing machines.  Those first in the queue get the numbered tickets and access to the site at a set show time.  Note that, in addition to those listed below, other sites may also switch to a numbered ticket system at short notice if crowded.\n\nThe grounds are divided into two ",{"type":"'''","value":["areas"]},", which in turn are subdivided into eight ",{"type":"'''","value":["zones"]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Nagakute Area"]},"\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Nagakute Area"]}," (長久手会場) is the heart of the Expo, containing the vast majority of the pavilions.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Global Commons"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:SingaporePavilion_White.JPG"],["thumb"],["240px"],["Inside the Singapore Pavilion"]]},"\n\nThe traditional country pavilions featuring the contributions of 120 countries, subdivided into 6 zones.
