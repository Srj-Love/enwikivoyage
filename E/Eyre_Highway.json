Vast desert spaces are not the norm for the whole journey.\n\nFor much of its length, the Eyre Highway can be described as a long and lonely road. While in the East in South Australia you still find some small towns like Kimba, Wudinna and Ceduna with some fencing suggesting farmland the Western Australian side of the trip has little or no visible agriculture adjacent to the highway.

Not all service stations are open 24-hours, so if you are not travelling in daylight hours then you will need to plan accordingly. Some of the side trips require a four-wheel drive, and you should let someone reliable know when you depart from the main road. Telstra has their NextG mobile coverage for significant parts of the highway. Optus offers service only within the major towns like Ceduna. Service on other carriers effectively does not exist. To get the best service, you will need an 850MHz capable phone and Telstra SIM.

The track starts just behind the roadhouse airstrip and runs in a north-northwesterly direction. You don't need a 4x4 because the track surface is quite solid and there are no obstacles to negotiate. On the other hand, you do need a reliable topographic map and a compass since there are almost no reference points along the way.

One gives you the advice: \"If you're crook, come to Cook.\" A second one is more blunt: \"Our hospital needs your help.
