They journeyed three weeks by foot with their sons with only enough supplies to find new farming land and a better life for their families. After returning to Rhode Island to bring back their families, other families soon joined them. They established churches and school houses. \n\nMany years later the town was very well known and soon had seven general stores, two hotels, three doctors, a tannery and a grist mill.
