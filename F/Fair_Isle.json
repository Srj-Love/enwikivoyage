There is no need for a car.  The #6 public transport bus runs a service from Lerwick to the pier to meet the ferry.  The ferry costs Â£3.10 and is paid when you arrive at the ferry.

Depending on the year you can see massive colonies of puffins congregating on the cliffs, arctic skuas, great skuas, rock pippets, arctic terns, fulmars, gannets, and many many many  more.\n\nThere is a small, one room museum that is worth seeing, at least out of respect to the people who call the island their home.  It's a lovely building and you're sure to run into a local who will give you some hints about what to see.\n\nFair Isle is also known for its traditional art, knitting, and your host can arrange for you to visit the arts & crafts building.  Don't be shy - everyone knows everyone and they are happy to show you.\n\nWalking around the island is the best way to see it.  Climb up to Malcolm's Head on the SW for sweeping views of the islands and cliffs, as well as to see the ruins of the old watchtower from the Napoleonic Wars.  Walk to Sheep Rock, where traditionally sheep were lowered perilously on chains to the other side of the water.  Ramble through beautiful fields with Fair Isle sheep.  Walk to the moors on the north side of the island and see the North Stack lighthouse.  At the right time of year you will see many yachts in the North Haven harbour.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nOther than your accomomdation you are likely to leave with as much money as you brought.
