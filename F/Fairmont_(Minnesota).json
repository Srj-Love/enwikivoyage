The building was constructed of massive Sioux quartzite (red rock) blocks which were quarried in southwest Minnesota. The red stone was combined with contrasting buff colored limestone for a polychromatic effect. The three gables at the top of the building each showcase three small arched stained glass windows while the main level of the building features 19 restored stained glass windows. The cornerstone came from Concord, New Hampshire, and contains many artifacts of Christian Science teaching and the local church history.
