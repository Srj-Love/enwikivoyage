In \"Fair Play\" every man would have an equal chance to stake a claim. Visitors aware of the town's gold-mining roots will find it impossible to miss the remains of the industry that mark the surrounding country side. Anyone interested in the history of the old west and western mining should visit the South Park City Museum in Fairplay.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nSouth Park City Museum\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["39.224444"],["-105.998056"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["South Central Colorado"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Fairplay,_Colorado"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North_America\/United_States\/Colorado\/Localities\/F\/Fairplay\/"]]}]
