References to the town and hamlet are technically important for historical and operational reasons, but outsiders are typically most familiar with the village and its name; for example, the area school district and postal zone are both named after Fairport.\n\nThe area has been inhabited by native Americans of the Seneca Nation since at least the 12th century. Europeans began settling as farmers here during the 18th century. The construction of the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Erie Canal"]]}]}," added modern forms of commerce in the 19th century.

Even so, the true center of the village—conceptually and practically—is at the canal where Main Street crosses on an historic lift bridge.\n\nBoaters can reach the village via the Erie Canal and moor between the Main Street and Parker Street bridges.
