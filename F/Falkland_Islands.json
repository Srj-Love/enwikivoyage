Since that time the islands have been the subject of ongoing territorial disputes, first between Britain and Spain, then between Britain and Argentina.  Since 1833 the islands have been under British control.\n\nOpen conflict between Britain and Argentina began on 2 April 1982 when Argentina sent troops to the islands. The British responded with an expeditionary force that landed seven weeks later. After fierce fighting in what is often known as the Falklands War, the Argentine occupation force was forced to surrender on 14 June 1982. Nonetheless, today Buenos Aires still refuses to give up Argentina's claim to the territory.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Economy"]},"\nThe economy of the Falklands was formerly based on agriculture (mainly sheep farming) but today fishing contributes the bulk of economic activity. Income from licensing foreign trawlers totals more than USD40 million per year with squid accounting for 75% of the fish taken. Agricultural activities mainly support domestic consumption with the exception of high grade wool which is exported. Surveys have revealed oil deposits within a 200 mile oil exploration zone around the islands and exploratory drilling is under way. The British military presence provides a sizeable economic boost.\n\nTourism is being actively encouraged and increasing rapidly with about 66,000 visitors in 2009; a significant part of the increase is from visiting cruise liners. The majority of visitors are from the UK but efforts are being made to encourage wildlife and adventure tourism. The main season is November to March but angling for sea trout is most favourable outside of this period.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\nThe most popular reason to visit is for the scenic beauty and the flora and fauna. Conservation is high on the Islands' agenda. Bird and marine species are the most prevalent fauna and include five species of penguin, four species of seal, albatross, petrels, the Falkland Flightless Steamer duck (",{"type":"''","value":["Logger Duck"]},"), other duck species, geese, hawks and falcons. The Striated Caracara (",{"type":"''","value":["Johnny Rook"]},") is a rare bird of prey found only on the Falkland Islands and some islands off Cape Horn.

The highest point in the islands is the 705m Mount Usbourne.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nStrong westerly winds are a constant in many parts of the islands. It is more likely to rain in the southeastern part of the islands with the far western islands getting very little yearly precipitation. Temperatures are cool and snow may occur at any time except for January and February, although accumulation is rare.

Flights from the UK last eighteen hours including a stop on ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ascension Island"]]}," en route. The RAF contracts two flights per week which are subject to military priorities.  There is also an airport in Stanley (PSY) but it has a smaller runway and is used primarily for flights within the Falklands.\n\nIt is expensive to get off the Island and a return flight to Santiago (the nearest airport interchange hub) costs approximately Â£800 per person and is a 7 hour flight.  It costs Â£1600 for a return ticket to the UK if you are eligible for discount (you need to be a FIG employee) otherwise it costs Â£2100.\n\nThe Mount Pleasant airport is 56km (35 miles) from Stanley. Falkland Island Tours & Travel (Tel: 21775, ",{"type":"[","value":["mailto:fitt@horizon.co.fk fitt@horizon.co.fk"]},") operates a shuttle bus that meets all flights and that can take visitors to and from the capital for Â£15.00 per person (one-way).

The planes are Britten Norman Islander aircraft, capable of carrying eight passengers plus pilot. Be aware however, that passenger load may be reduced depending on the condition of the airstrips being visited. With the exception of Stanley and Mount Pleasant, all airstrips in the Falklands are either dirt strips or grassy fields. Be prepared for slight delays while livestock is cleared from airstrips prior to takeoff\/landing!\n\nFIGAS flights leave twice daily from the airstrip just outside of Stanley and travel to a variety of locations throughout the islands. There is a baggage limit of 20 kg per person which is strictly enforced; you and your baggage will be weighed prior to boarding in Stanley. For those with more than 14 kg of baggage there is an additional charge of Â£1.00 per kg, space permitting. Note that unless the plane is flying to an island with a very poor landing strip there are almost never weight constraints that would prevent travelling with a few extra kilos of baggage.\n\nReservations are required for travel and should be booked at least 24 hours in advance. Booking reservations can be done either by calling the airport (Tel: 27219), emailing ",{"type":"[","value":["mailto:freservations@figas.gov.fk freservations@figas.gov.fk"]}," or visiting the airport in person when it is open (hours vary depending on flight schedules but mid-morning is usually a good time). Flight schedules are announced the night before departure and are also available via a fax service.

For large groups it may be possible to charter a boat in advance thus providing a great way to visit some of the less-travelled islands.

Ferry tickets must be booked in advance from Workboat Services on 22300. As of December 2008 example prices were:\nFoot Passage single Â£10; Car Passage single Â£25.\n\nLarge cruise ships are the most common means for people to visit the Falklands, and most will make several landings at various islands. Note that aside from Stanley all landings from cruise ships are done using zodiacs (small inflatable boats), and in many cases the lack of docking areas will require a quick wade from the zodiac onto shore.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]}," \nWithin Stanley there are two taxi services that can be hired for travel throughout the town and surrounding areas, including the Mount Pleasant airport.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Land Rover"]}," \nLand Rover rental may be possible from Stanley.

Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands which is located in Stanley across from the FIC West store. British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere in the islands and within Stanley credit cards and American currency are also often accepted. On the outlying islands credit cards will probably not be accepted, although British and American currency may be taken; check with the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable payment method.\n\nIt is nearly impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside of the islands, so be sure to exchange all money prior to leaving the islands.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]}," \nMeals in the Falklands are primarily traditional British. Fish and chips, roast beef, mutton and tea are standard fare. There are some Spanish influences such as Milanesa and Casuela. While in camp many of the lodges provide home-cooked meals in very generous portions and their food is generally better than is found in Stanley's pubs and cafÃ©s. However, Stanley does have a few good restaurants.\n\nIt is difficult to find fresh fruit and vegetables, and they are generally very expensive.  A banana will cost Â£1 and a small orange or one single plum will cost 90p. Cabbage and cauliflower costs around Â£4.50 for half a portion. Half a portion of lettuce costs around Â£3.50 and a small cucumber costs Â£4. Tomatoes for some reason are very expensive, if you buy 2 small tomatoes that will set you back Â£2.50! There is no fresh milk available and all milk is UHT\/long life milk. The only fresh meat on sale in the supermarket is mutton. A frozen chicken costs around Â£12 for a 2kg bird. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]}," \nWhile most items in the Falklands are expensive due to the cost of importing, there are no taxes on alcohol making beer prices fairly reasonable. Pubs and lodges offer a wide selection, although most drinks will usually come from a can or bottle rather than a tap.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]}," \nAccommodation in Stanley includes numerous bed and breakfasts as well as a handful of hotels. Buildings are generally older and the warm hospitality also seems to come from a bygone age. While in camp lodging includes everything from old farmhouses to lodges built specifically for tourism. Camping may be permitted with permission of the landowner. Many places are self-catering meaning supplies will need to be purchased in either Stanley or from a local source, if one is available. When in camp it is essential that lodging be reserved in advance; in Stanley it is generally possible to find lodging without a reservation but it is still recommended that reservations be made.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Work"]},"\nA work permit is required for any foreign national, including UK citizens, working in the Falklands. Work permits should generally be applied for prior to coming to the islands and will require an employer's sponsorship. Additional information can be found at the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.falklands.gov.fk\/workpermit.htm Falkland Islands Government site"]},".\n\nLike everything in the Falklands, living expenses will be very high.  Kerosene (the only form of heating available to most housing here) costs Â£200 to Â£300 or more per month to heat a small 3 bed house. The internet is very expensive and it costs around Â£80 per month for a limited data package of 4GB per month.  Overall the cost of living is at least 3 times higher than the UK.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]}," \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Falklands-Minefield.JPG"],["thumb"],["A marked minefield at Port William photographed in 2003"]]},"\nCrime is relatively unknown in the Falklands, although one should still take the normal precautions of not leaving items unattended or travelling alone late at night. If problems are encountered the police force should be helpful.\n\nUnexploded ordnance from the 1982 conflict, including land mines, are still found in the islands. No civilians have been harmed by landmines since the conflict ended, and the remaining minefields are all well marked and clearly cordoned off. It is a criminal offence to enter a minefield or to remove minefield signage.\n\nMany animals in the islands can be dangerous when cornered or with young. Elephant seals, sea lions and fur seals are probably the most dangerous; keep a safe distance when viewing these animals. A general rule is that if the animal seems to notice your presence, you are too close.\n\nThe Falklands, being located at a far southern latitude, may be affected by the Antarctic ozone hole from August until December. During this time be sure to wear sunscreen on sunny days, as the risk of sunburn is increased significantly. During other months of the year the ozone hole shrinks and the danger from the sun is not significantly greater than anywhere else on the planet. However, it is wise to wear sunscreen as the burning effect of the sun is often under-estimated by visitors to the islands.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]}," \nThere are no special medical requirements for visiting the Falklands. There is a large hospital in Stanley, but outside of the capital there are no medical facilities. For serious injuries, the costs of being airlifted out of the islands are very high.

You should ",{"type":"''","value":["never"]}," refer to the islands as Argentine. In a 2013 referendum, 99.8% of the turnout voted to remain British, and many residents were there during the 1982 war. This should give you a good idea of how likely you are to cause offence, as calling the islands Argentine is virtually guaranteed to irritate and potentially start a fight, unless used sarcastically (which, as a rule of thumb, should not be a subtle joke and instead should be very clear of what you actually mean). \n\nIn addition to the above concerns, there exists a ",{"type":"'''","value":["Country Code"]}," that should be followed by visitors to the islands:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Always ask permission before entering private land."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Keep to paths wherever possible.

Broadband internet access now exists island-wide although speeds are much closer to dialup, 56 Kbps or less. Several hotels, as well as the visitor centre offer computers that accept Cable & Wireless internet cards and there are an increasing number of Wi-Fi hotspots. Both phone and internet cards can be purchased from the Cable & Wireless office in Stanley (located on the hill past the War Memorial), as well as in some of the stores in town. The larger lodges will also sell phone cards and may have internet cards. More recently a GSM cell phone network has been made available but works only for Stanley, Mount Pleasant and a few other locations on East Falkland.\n\nThe postal service in the Falklands is reliable and letters can be mailed easily from Stanley and most settlements.
