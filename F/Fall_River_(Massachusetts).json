In and about the areas around these mills the streets, once cobblestone, have been paved however near the center of the city (end of Plymouth Ave) you may catch a glimpse of the past after a bad winter when the pavement is broken up. In fact that area was paved over (including the trolley tracks about 20 yrs ago). Fall River is also the home of the historical Lizzie Borden trial, as well as the hometown of famous chef, Emeril Lagasse.\n\nFall River has the highest percentage (over 40%) of Portuguese of any city in the country; most are of Azorean descent.\n\nNew England climates are typically unpredictable and can range from bitter cold to very hot.
