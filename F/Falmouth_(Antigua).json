Monks Hill is home to one of the forty forts constructed by the British during their occupation of the island of the island during the 1800s. The Fort was constructed as a place of refuge should the French ever attack Falmouth Harbour. History has it that while a French ship was passing on its way to Guadaloupe that the British evacuated the town in fear of an attack. Remains of the fort can still be seen and explored today. To arrive at this historical landmark proceed to the village of Falmouth on the islands South Easterly coast line in the parish of St.Paul's. After passing through the village of Falmouth you will be entering the village of Cobbs Cross. Turn left after the Cobbs Cross Primary School. There is a Y junction a few yards from the turn but be sure to keep on the left. Make the second left and proceed to the top of the hill where a beautiful view of Falmouth Harbour awaits you. N.B. only 4x4 vehicles have the ability to make it to the top. If you attempt this feat in any other vehicle you will have to abandon ship half way and make the remainder of the journey on foot."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Bailey's Countryside Flowers"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Sells flowers."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=C.E.
