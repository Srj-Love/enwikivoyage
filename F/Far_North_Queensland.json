From Townsville heading North there are many picnic areas, swimming facilities, and national parks only accessible by car. An example of such places include Crystal Creek, Paluma, Mission Beach, as well as the northern beaches of Cairns. The Atherton Tablelands also becomes available for you to explore at your own rate.\n\nHire cars are readily available in both Townsville and Cairns, with one way hires available (sometimes with a substantial fee, so remember to make sure).\n\nRoads are generally of good condition, with the Bruce Highway providing the primary link to North Queensland with access to the coastal towns. Some dirt roads do exist near particular attractions so checking your hire car insurance policy would be worth while.\n\nFuel is generally easy to come by along the highways. If driving between Townsville and Cairns and the many attractions in between, fuel is available at towns such as Ingham and Tully. Cash, credit card and bank cards are generally all accepted, and many of the fuel stations are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cape York Peninsula"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Crystal Cascades"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Daintree Rainforest"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Gulf Country"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Tablelands Region"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Wet Tropics of Queensland"]}," - a UNESCO World Heritage site"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Australian Muster Experience"],["url=http:\/\/www.australianmusterexperience.com"],["email="],["address=KIngston Rd, Whyanbeel Valley"],["lat=16"],["long=145"],["directions="],["phone=+61 7 4098 1149"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=Starts at $63"],["content=An authentic outback cattle station that puts on BBQ lunch shows illustrating daily life on a remote cattle station.
