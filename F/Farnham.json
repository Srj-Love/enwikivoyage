The town \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nWith evidence to suggest that Farnham has been a settlement for tens of thousands of years, the town is rich in history. Taking in the Stone Age, Bronze Age and Iron Age, the Romans and Saxons also settled in Farnham. The town boasts an intact Norman castle and keep, built for the Bishop of Winchester as a half-way point between his home in Winchester and London. Part of the castle and its keep are now open to the public. Farnham and its castle played a major part in the English Civil War, with visits from King Charles I and Oliver Cromwell. Following this period, the town became known for its market, which the author Daniel Defoe described as the greatest after London. Industries in the town have included the production of pottery, wool, crops, flour, and beer. \n\nFarnham borders on the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and the North Downs Way long-distance path starts here. Alice Holt Forest is nearby, as are Frensham Ponds and many heaths and downland scenery.\n\nFarnham School of Art, associated with the Arts and Crafts Movement, was opened in 1866, and is now part of the University for the Creative Arts ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ucreative.ac.uk"]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nBuses run from Farnham to surrounding towns and villages usually every hour.
