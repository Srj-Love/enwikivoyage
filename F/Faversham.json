The Javelin high speed service operates every 30 minutes from London St Pancras. There is a supplement for using this service unless travelling from outside of the London region.\n\nNote that many trains from London to Ramsgate and Dover leave London as a single train and split in two at Faversham. If boarding at Faversham and travelling East or South it is important to get in the right train as there will be two trains on the one platform after the split.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Standard Quay, Faversham - geograph.org.uk - 1654.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Standard Quay, Faversham"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nMost services provided by ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.arrivabus.co.uk‎ Arriva Kent & Surrey"]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.stagecoachbus.com\/‎ Stagecoach"]}," and ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.chalkwell.co.uk\/‎ Chalkwell Buses"]}," link with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sittingbourne"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Maidstone"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Canterbury (England)"],["Canterbury"]]}," and the surrounding areas.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=National Fruit Collection at Brogdale Farm"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.brogdalecollections.co.uk"],["email="],["address="],["lat=51.30042"],["long=0.87668"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Brogdale Road, Faversham, ME13 8XZ, about 1 mile from the town centre.
