The 77 route runs to Landuard fort and port viewing area, but the town is best explored on foot or bicycle.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nFelixstowe is long past its heyday as a tourist resort, and is best visited now as a place to enjoy some seaside calm.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Felixstowe Ferry"]}," is perhaps the most charming part of the town. It's in the far north, beyond the golf club, at the mouth of the River Deben. It's a popular place for sailing and walks. It has good real ale pub (see below). It is best to park at the cliff top car park as there is little parking at Felixstowe ferry.\n\nThe promenade stretches 1 mile North and South of the pier two limes in total, and expect for a small length there is a good path (it is part of the Suffolk Coast long distance path) between Landguard Fort and Felixstowe Ferry. North is generally quite pleasant, with landscaped gardens and quiet shingle beaches.\n\nIn the centre of tourist area, by the sea, there are some excellent arcades, including the famous Mannings Amusement Park (including crazy golf). There is a Sunday Market beside Mannings, and a Car Boot sale on Saturday\n\nFurther South the beach gives way to a very industrialised dock area. In the middle of this is a little wildlife haven, around Landguard Fort. It's popular with bird watchers.\n\nThe sea shore is the site of the last opposed invasion of England in 1667 and the first land battle of the Royal Marines. The current fort was built in the 18th century, modified in 19th century with substantial additional 19th \/ 20th century outside batteries. The fort is open every day from Easter to October.\n\nThe nearby submarine mining building houses Felixstowe museum’s collections of local interest and is open Sundays & Wednesdays in summer.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Landguard Fort"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.english-heritage.org.uk\/daysout\/properties\/landguard-fort\/"],["email="],["address= View Point Road, IP11 3TW"],["lat=51.936826"],["long=1.320806"],["directions="],["phone=+44 1394 675900"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=adults £4.00, children £1.50, concessions £3.00"],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nThe fantastic amusement parks are a great day out, and for those looking to party away the night, you won't forget the über-cool bandbox nightclub.\n\nBetween the promenade and Felixstowe Ferry there's about a mile of beaches known as \"The Dip\". It's dominated by beach huts but not a bad place to enjoy the beach in the summer.\n\nThere are a variety of pleasant country walks around Felixstowe, particularly in the Orwell and Deben estuaries. However, you need a car to get to these areas from the town.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nThe best thing that Felixstowe has to offer on the shopping front are two exceptional second-hand bookstores. ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Treasure Chest"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Poor Richard's"]}," are both in the town centre.

The young and trendy should try either the Grosvenor which is behind the main shop street on Ranleigh road, or The Alex on the sea front. Though the Cork should be noted for its Balcony with views across the sea.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nFelixstowe being an English seaside resort, there is no shortage of overpriced, poor-quality B&B accommodation. There is nowhere in town worth singling out, except when The Fludyers is opened. \nThis Edwardian building currently undergoing major renovation, will be opening Spring 2013.\n\nRead more: http:\/\/www.fludyerarmshotel.co.uk.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ipswich (England)"],["Ipswich"]]},", the Orwell and Deben estuaries are all easily visited from Felixstowe.
