[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["TT Banner.jpg"]]},"\nThis page aims to provide an overview of all the ferry services in the Red Sea between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Middle East"],["Middle Eastern countries"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nMany tourists want to travel between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jordan"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Egypt"]]}," with both offering a huge amount for tourists to see. These countries also act as gateways to other countries in the region. Many travellers want to avoid travelling through ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Israel"]]}," due to the difficulties of the border crossing and possible problems crossing into other countries later.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Prepare"]},"\n\nCheck with the relevant authorities to make sure that you are able to get the required visas either beforehand or on arrival.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Jordan to Egypt"]},"\n\nThe company ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=ABMaritime"],["url=http:\/\/www.abmaritime.com.jo\/english.html"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}," runs boats between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Aqaba"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nuweiba"]]}," every day except Saturday. There are two classes of boats - a slow ferry and a fast ferry. By all accounts from other travellers attempting this crossing, the fast ferry is worth the extra USD$10. The fast ferry is supposed to run twice daily and costs USD$70.\n\nTickets MUST be bought at the ABMaritime office in Aqaba town and cannot be bought at the Port of Aqaba which is located 10 km south of the city.\n\nOnce at the port, you must pay your departure tax on the ground floor of the white building (8 JD), but note that there are NO ATMs at the port, so make sure you have cash. There is a currency exchange upstairs. Once the departure tax has been paid, go upstairs and get your passport stamped by immigration officials.\n\nBuses will take you to the ferry, and once on board you will notice everyone lining up at a window inside the vessel. Once the queue has shrunk, head to the window and talk to the Egyptian border official. If you are only staying in the Sinai peninsula of Egypt, or already have an Egyptian visa you will just get your passport stamped and returned. If you need an Egyptian visa your passport will be collected for pickup at the port.\n\nNote that although the ferry is quoted as taking one hour, it takes an additional hour at either end to load\/unload the ferry. Once you arrive in Nuweiba you will be on the boat for a while longer.\n\nOnce in Egypt, if your passport was collected you must buy a visa sticker from either of the banks where the bus drops you and then find the two story brick building to collect your passport. The Egyptian visa costs USD$15 at the port.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.meenagate.com Meenagate Touristic Marine Line"]}]}," runs passengers only ferry services between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Aqaba"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nuweiba"]]},". Meenagate's fast ferry leaves ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Aqaba"]]}," at 6.00pm and the journey takes roughly one hour and thirty minutes. Coming back from Nuweiba can be done the next day: the ferry leaves Egypt at 6am.

There are two classes of boats - a slow ferry and a fast ferry. By all accounts from other travellers attempting this crossing, the fast ferry is worth the extra USD$10. The fast ferry is supposed to run twice daily and costs USD$70. You must pay in USD when buying a ticket as other currency is not accepted.\n\nThe ticket office at Nuweiba port is south of the port complex. As you look at the port, it is to the right on the other side of the first cross intersection. There are separate lines for Egyptians and foreigners and because of the paper work involved to transport vehicles on the boat the lines are long. Allow 90 minutes to get your ticket. You will need to pay the fare in USD and also a 50 Egyptian Pound departure tax at the same time.\n\nInside the port, follow the other people into the immigration room to get your passport checked and wait in the large 'waiting room' shed. Note that the ferries can be very unreliable in regards to schedule so keep asking the officials what time the vessel will depart. It is not uncommon for a ferry scheduled for 12pm to be delayed until 6pm. There is limited food options here no make sure you bring some snacks and lunch with you. There are some well priced cafes outside the port, and a good selection of food once on the fast ferry.\n\nIf possible, avoid putting your bags in the cages that are lined up before the ferry. It is preferable to leave your bags inside the hold of the boat instead. At the other end they throw the bags out of the cages on the ground so make sure there is nothing fragile in them.\n\nBuses will take you to the ferry, and once on board you will notice everyone lining up at a window inside the vessel. Once the queue has shrunk, head to the window and talk to the Jordanian border official. If you have a non-Arabic passport the official will probably take your passport for collection once inside Aqaba port. Once you walk into the white building, it is down a passage way on the right past the currency exchangers.\n\nNote that although the ferry is quoted as taking one hour, it takes and additional hour at either end to load\/unload the ferry.
