One of the easiest ways to get around is to use the red taxis to take you to the nearest gate (bab) and then walk from there until you get your bearings.  Gates are all around the city and taxis are cheap.  A rough map of where the sights are will help too. If you are particularly worried, be sure to arrange a licensed guide through your hotel or the tourism office - they will be able to give you an accurate history and will make fewer shopping stops. The faux-guides in particular will simply take you from shop to shop where you will be pressured to buy goods, which will cost you extra because the seller will be obliged to pay the guide a hidden commission.\n\nThere are some basic landmarks that you can use to get around, and there is a path network marked by signs perched on walls, although these can be hard to locate at times. These signs have a 8-point star shape which will guide you between the main places in the medina. If you are lost you only have to find one of these signs and follow it in any direction until you arrive to a map or a known place. You may also find it useful to carry a compass, as the narrow, built-up streets can block the view of landmarks and be disorienting.  Alternatively, just keep heading downhill and you will eventually get to a gate.\nThe main street is the Talaa Kbira, which runs from Bab Boujeloud to the Kairouine ",{"type":"'''","value":["mosque"]}," in the heart of the medina. The Talaa Sghira also begins at Bab Boujeloud and eventually merges back into the Talaa Kbira. Once you get into the narrow, windy heart of the medina, you can also find your way out again by constantly heading downhill, which will eventually lead to the Place R'cif, a dropoff for buses and taxis, where you can get a petit taxi out of the medina.\n\nFor more detailed tours and directions, look for the book ",{"type":"''","value":["Fez from Bab to Bab"]}," (Hammad Berrada). It has a complete map of the medina and several well-described walking tours.

Take standard precautions regarding wallet, purse, etc. If you hear \"Belek! Belek!\" behind you, stand aside because a heavily-laden donkey is bearing down on you! Appear to know where you are going, even if you don't, or you will get offers from false guides. False guides are not dangerous but they can be exasperatingly tenacious. Best technique is to not even acknowledge their presence. That is rude and they won't be pleased, but it is better than to have them walk with you for half an hour. If you have to ask directions ask to someone that is obviously busy in his own business and try to appear as sure as you can of the way you are going (\"This way to R'cif, right?\"). Getting caught with a faux guide will cost you, but it will cost the faux guide more: they can receive up to 2 days imprisonment if they get caught. Cops are often in plain clothes, so be wary! A useful strategy with false guides is to say all the lines they have been taught before they have said them to show you know what you are doing; they all say the same thing so just learn it and repeat.\n\nYou should also beware of hustlers (aka con-artists); Fez has a far larger number of them than almost everywhere else and they use more sophisticated techniques. An example of a prominent scam occurs where you come into Fez by train and someone talks to you saying he is coming to visit his relatives, and is actually a respectable outsider (e.g. an owner of a hotel). He will then ask you to come eat with his relatives and when you get there they will spend most of the time trying to suggest accommodation, offering you tours where they gain commission from all the (especially Carpet) shops, and even organize expensive desert excursions that are actually just you driving in circles just outside the city for three days.\n\nBeware of people at the train\/bus station (even the bus driver) who introduce you to their \"cousins\" or \"brothers,\" trying to involve you in some sort of carpet-selling scam, and especially refrain from handing over your credit card in such situations.\nThere are many other scams and annoyances trying to get you into a shop\/restaurant\/hotel with various degrees of lying in the stories people make up. If in doubt, be independent and look for yourself e.g. whether the hotel you want to go to is indeed closed or under construction.\n\nThis is unfortunately one of the sad things about Morocco, that you get to distrust every one, even those people who are genuinely friendly and hospitable, because sometimes this is only a façade.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\nFor a North American traveller, Fez requires a real change of outlook or it will be a very high-stress trip! Shopkeepers and guides are very assertive and you will have to get used to saying \"no\" a lot. On the other hand, they can be genuinely warm and friendly even while trying to sell you something, an idea that is pretty alien to North Americans where it is assumed that a business relationship is the opposite of sincerity!\n\nNon-Muslims are not allowed to visit mosques, although they can visit the medersas (religious schools).\n\nBargaining is a way of life that has survived for centuries, and shows no sign of changing.  Moroccans even bargain among each other for everything except perhaps their utilities.  Don't believe anyone (and you will hear it all the time) who tells you prices are being \"regulated\".  Every other souk claims to be a \"Government Regulated Co-op\".\n\nThere is a single, genuine government-regulated fixed price shop in the Ville Nouvelle where all prices are posted, the goods are of decent (if not amazing) quality, and the single bored cashier will just stare incredulously at you if you attempt to bargain with him.
