Fife has a history steeped in Economic achievement - from its founder father, Adam Smith (born in Kirkcaldy) to perhaps the world's greatest businessman\/philanthropist, Andrew Carnegie (born in Dunfermline). This current tradition is upheld by the last UK Prime Minister, Gordon Brown.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nThe major language (as in the rest of Scotland) is English, but the Fife acccent can be difficult to understand (for those not used to the variety of accent in the UK, and not as difficult as some areas of Scotland). Many people, as in much of the rest of Scotland, use a form of English known as 'Lallans' or Lowlands English which does include some words that you may not be used to (for example \"aye\" for \"yes\" or \"ken\" for \"know\").\n\n\"Braw\" is used locally as a word for general approval that you may be unfamiliar with (even having experience with speaking to Scottish people). As in \"That'd be braw\" meaning \"That'd be fine\/great\", or simply \"Braw!\" meaning \"Great!\" or \"OK!\".\n\nHowever, you need fear not! Speaking (standard\/normal\/American\/Australian\/English) \"English\" will not make you incomprehensible to Fifers, and Fifers will generally try to make themselves understood to you if you have problems with the dialect (I wouldn't push it too far in a pub later on in the evening, however).\n\nAs with the rest of the UK do not expect foreign language capability to be great, or even good (with the possible exception of areas such as St Andrews where the people are more used to tourists). Most people are educated in French or German, some in Spanish or Italian, but generally not to a conversational level (that they remember!). There are, of course, exceptions to this rule.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nEdinburgh Airport ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.edinburghairport.com\/"]}," (EDI) is the most convenient airport for most of Fife. Edinburgh airport is well served from across the UK and some European cities by the likes of BA, BMI, easyJet, flyglobespan, flybe, Scotairways, Lufthansa, Air France and KLM, and now also has direct flights to the USA with Delta and Continental. There's a bus service (747 line ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.airdirect747.com\/"]},") direct to Inverkeithing from the airport, where you can change for another bus or for the train. It takes from 25 to 45 minutes (depending on the traffic). Fares are Â£4.50 single or \"day return\", half for children. Otherwise, get the bus\/taxi into Edinburgh and catch the train from Haymarket or Waverley. You could of course also hire a car.\n\nGlasgow airport is about a 90 minute drive from the Forth Road Bridge (entryway to Fife).\n\nThere is also a small airport in Dundee that has commercial scheduled connections from London City (with Scotairways) - this airport is convenient for some of Fife also.\nFife Airport ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.taysideaviation.co.uk\/"]}," is found in Glenrothes - there are no commercial scheduled flights to this airport.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By train"]},"\n\nTrains from Edinburgh (or further south) to Dundee (or Aberdeen) stop at Inverkeithing, Aberdour, Burntisland, Kirkcaldy, Markinch, Cupar and Leuchars (for St Andrews). You can use the GNER service on the East Coast Mainline directly from London to Kirkcaldy, though this is a long trip. There is also a very good local or 'circle' service which services Dunfermline, Rosyth, Thornton (for Glenrothes, although Markinch is also handy) and other towns.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By car"]},"\n\nUse the M90 motorway to access Fife from the north (Perth) or south (Edinburgh). A92 gives access from Dundee\/Aberdeen. Also easy access from Stirling to Kincardine\/Dunfermline via A985. A92\/A985\/A91 are major trunk routes through Fife.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nMajor bus stations in Kirkcaldy, Dunfermline, Glenrothes, St Andrews and Cupar are served by Stagecoach among others (for example, some Megabus services make stops at Inverkeithing). See above for details of getting to Fife by bus from Edinburgh airport.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nRoads are in generally good condition and not too crowded. The only motorway (the M90) passes straight through Fife, and the dual carriageway network is limited - so only drive if you feel comfortable on single carriageway roads, and some even smaller roads. To get around most areas (including to get to St Andrews) you will need to take trunk roads and through towns. Many of these towns have traffic calming schemes in place that can be difficult to negotiate (for example in Colinsburgh) or have through roads that are very narrow (or have parking on one side) where traffic can only really pass in one direction at a time (for example in Kingskettle). Don't let this put you off, though - take your time and remember to drive on the left (keep yourself as driver and the steering wheel towards the center of the road at all times, just as at home!) and you can see some of the best parts of Fife - the North Fife Tourist trail through the East Neuk is a fantastic route to drive to St Andrews, stopping in the picturesque villages en route. Falkland has some bad blind corners, so take care.\n\nGenerally speaking, the most convenient way to get from Edinburgh (Airport) to St Andrews is to hire a car and drive - especially if you're arriving with golf clubs!\n\nCheck Traveline Scotland ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.travelinescotland.com\/"]}," for full details of public transport and a journey planner.\n\nBus and rail services are excellent (the 'Fife Circular' service runs from Edinburgh Waverley to all train stations in West and Central Fife.

The cycle route from Edinburgh to Aberdeen also passes through Fife.\n\nOn foot you can take the Coastal Path ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.fifecoastalpath.com\/index.asp?cat=Home"]}," which starts (and ends) at the Kincardine, Tay or Forth Road Bridges.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["St Andrews"]]},": home of golf and oldest university in Scotland (founded 1410)\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kirkcaldy"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Culross"]]},"\n\nSecret Bunker: a former underground nuclear bunker now open to the public.\n\nEast Neuk: charming, photogenic fishing villages (includes Elie - with a blue flag beach, Pittenweem, Crail and Anstruther).\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kirkcaldy"]]}," Museum and Art Gallery.\n\nFalkland Palace\n\nDunfermline\n\nAdam Smith Theatre\n\nRothes Halls\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=MacDuff Castle"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"===","value":["Itineraries"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nGet on your bike and enjoy the marvellous cycle routes\n\nVisit the county's many fine parks (Beveridge in Kirkcaldy, Pittencrieff in Dunfermline, Lochore Meadows, etc.).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Anstrutherfishbar2.jpg"],["thumb"],["Anstruther Fish Bar"]]},"\nThe Bengal Tiger Indian Restaurant at Pittencrieff Street, Dunfermline, near to the park, offers excellent food, and has special half price offers every Sunday to Friday night inclusive.\n\nFor Fish & Chips (or Ice Cream!) try the Anstruther Fish Bar ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.anstrutherfishbar.co.uk\/"]},", which has won awards.
