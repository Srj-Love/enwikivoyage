It is the seat of the Alt Empordà county in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Girona (province)"],["Girona Province"]]}," and has a wealth of history spanning many centuries that has been preserved and shown in several museums in the area as well as in the compact Old Town.  Being the last major town before the Spanish\/French border, it serves as a fantastic base to explore the upper Empordá region that is awash in great food, wines, and beaches that represent the Catalan culture.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThe city's main attraction is the world famous museum of native son, Salvador Dalí . After the Prado in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Madrid"]]},", it is the most visited museum in all of Spain.  It is often seen as part of a day-trip from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Barcelona"]]}," or the packaged hotels of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Costa Brava"]]},".\n\nBut beyond the museum, Figueres can be a pleasant place to spend a night or two.  The town, much like Girona, is a relaxed alternative to Barcelona with relaxing cafés on side streets, and a compact Old Town core.  The Empordà region in general will appeal to those interested in the history and\/or burgeoning viticulture and gastronomy of Northern Catalonia.  Figueres works well as a base for day trips to these destinations.  It is also happens to be the case that Figueres is 15 minutes by car or 25 minutes by train from the beaches of the Costa Brava.\n\nThe name of the town means 'fig trees' as historically they grew with great abundance around the area.  Local youth often colloquially refer to the town as 'Figui' for short.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nFigueres descended from two Roman towns, Juncària and Figàries, but the actual establishment of the town really started to happen in the 10th century as stated in records from the Sant Pere Monastery that existed in the space where the Sant Pere church is today. As it was not an outpost border town in the Marca Hispanica (such as neighboring ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Besalú"]]}," or Peralada), it was of little significance until first made a Royal Town in 1267 and then much later, when the Sant Ferran castle was built from 1753 to 1766.\n\nOnce the castle came in to existence, fortunes changed a great deal for Figueres as it became the supply base for the castle. The population grew and it started its course towards being the major town of the region, despite occupation by Napoleon's forces from 1808-1814. Between 1831 and 1840, the Rambla was created by covering a dry riverbed, and thus became a center for the town. The shade trees that stand on the Rambla were originally planted in 1864. In 1877, the railway station was opened. In 1904, the town's most famous resident, one Salvador Domingo Felipe Jacinto Dalí i Domènech was born.\n\nThe Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) was quite hard on the town. The castle became the last outpost for Republican Spain and Franco's forces bombed the town with great ferocity. As was the case with a lot of the surrounding area, many structures were lost in the war, including the main theater, which stood in ruin for several decades.\n\nUpon attaining critical and financial success around the world, Dalí bought the old theater in his home town and converted it in to the museum that we see today, and which is a major draw of tourism to the town.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nAs Figueres is in Catalonia and Catalonia is an independent, yet integral part of Spain, everybody in Figueres can speak ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Spanish phrasebook"],["Spanish"]]},", albeit to varying degrees. Despite the fact that ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Catalan phrasebook"],["Catalan"]]}," was banned from being spoken under the Franco regime and Spanish was the only language, the older generation above 60, when speaking Spanish, will often speak a form of \"Spatalan\", which is mostly Spanish but with a lot of Catalan tossed in which can be difficult to understand at times for foreigners. And keep in mind that Catalan is as separate a language from Spanish as French and Italian are. It is not a Spanish dialect.\n\nFor those wishing to make the effort to speak some Catalan, keep in mind that they speak Northern Catalan, which has a strong influence of French through the interchange with French and Catalan speakers across the border in France. Such dishes as 'pa amb tomaquet' (bread with tomato) become 'pa amb tomate' with a soft 'uh' sound at the end. There are many more examples and one of the most difficult is when they say words that end with 'o' and say it with a long 'u' sound. If you make the effort to say neighboring town names in Catalan, make sure you understand the pronunciation and if you say Barcelona pronouncing the Castillian 'th' sound for the 'c', people will assume that you are speaking Spanish.\n\nThe generation under 35 will generally speak some if not a good deal of English as well as French. Some people here and there may speak a little Italian and oddly enough, there is a large Russian community in Figueres who naturally can speak Russian. But these are all the language regularly spoken. Those who speak only Germanic languages will have a difficult time communicating.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:figueres map.png"],["thumb"],["400px"],["Map of Figueres"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By rail"]},"\nThe Renfe website ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.renfe.com"]}," has been historically unusable, but as of the time of this writing, the English language version has been completely overhauled to now be a very solid reference, although other languages remain spotty at best.

The office can provide more information, although the website is extremely helpful in locating wineries.\n\nFor those wishing to make a tour of the wineries, you will definitely need a car as they are in far-flung villages around the area.  Closest to Figueres are the wineries of La Vinyeta ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.lavineta.es"]}," and Perelada ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.castilloperelada.com\/"]},".  The former is a very new, modern winery started by a young winemaker who is making some of the most exciting wines in the region neat the village of Mollets.  The later is a much more established winery that sits next to the castle of Perelada, which is a small town about five minutes by car from Figueres.  Their wines are rather pricey, but they have grown to carry a high pedigree whether deserved or not.  Perelada also charges for tastings, which is rather uncommon.\n\nOutside of these two regions, a drive up to the village Cantallops is recommended as in addition to being a delightful town, it houses the wineries of Vinyes dels Aspres ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.vinyesdelsaspres.cat\/"]}," and Masia Serra.  Both of these wineries are making splendid wines, especially the sweet Garnatxas (Grenache) and Moscatells.  You will need to call Masia Serra before visiting though as it is rarely open to the public.\n\nAnother village worth visiting for wine is Capmany which has Arché Pagès ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cellerarchepages.com\/"]}," and about 10 other wineries.\n\nHeading in the other direction, one can go to Vilajuïga which has Empordàlia ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.empordalia.com\/"]}," that makes the Sinols brand.  Additionally, they also have wine 'a granel' or in bulk that is of high quality and can be bought for less than 1.50€ a liter.\n\nFor those who can't make it to these wineries, thankfully the local wine shops in Figueres sell all these brands for those wishing to take back something from Figueres that isn't related to Dalí.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nFigueres provides a variety of hotels, with rates much cheaper than in Barcelona, but generally comparable to Girona.
