Its majestic and varied coral reefs today draw tourists from around the world, but were the nightmare of European mariners until well into the 19th century.  As a result, Fijians have retained their land and often much of the non-commercial, sharing attitude of people who live in vast extended families with direct access to natural resources.  When it came, European involvement and cession to Britain was marked by the conversion to Christianity, the cessation of brutal tribal warfare and cannibalism, and the immigration of a large number of indentured Indian labourers, who now represent nearly half of the population, as well as smaller numbers of Europeans and Asians.  Today, Fiji is a land of tropical rain forests, coconut plantations, fine beaches, and fire-cleared hills. For the casual tourist it is blessedly free of evils such as malaria, landmines, or terrorism that attend many similarly lovely places in the world.\n\nInternal political events in the recent past resulted in a reduction in tourism.

Democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in 1987, caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by the Indian community (descendants of contract labourers brought to the islands by the British in the 19th century). The coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native Melanesian control of Fiji, led to heavy Indian emigration. The population loss resulted in economic difficulties, but ensured that Melanesians became the majority. A new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable. Free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by an Indo-Fijian, but a civilian-led coup in May 2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil. Parliamentary elections held in August 2001 provided Fiji with a democratically elected government led by Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase.

Elections are scheduled to be held again in 2014.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Culture"]},"\nIndigenous Fijian culture and tradition is very vibrant and is an integral component of everyday life for the majority of Fiji's population.

Rates are very cheap:  F$1-2 from Colo-i-Suva to Suva bus station by bus, F$17 from Nadi bus station to Suva by share-taxi (share-taxi's are usually white mini-vans that congregate and set-off when they reach their capacity of 6-8), or approximately F$80 from Suva airport to Sigatoka by private taxi.  On the main road circling Viti Levu buses run every half hour and taxis are a substantial proportion of traffic, while on western Taveuni buses make only a few runs per day and very little traffic is present. If taxi has a meter, ask the driver to switch it on - the ride will be lot cheaper than with negotiated price.\n\nThe current going rate from resorts on Nadi beach to Nadi downtown is $8 per passenger, and $12 to the airport -- you should be able negotiate this price reasonably easily.\n\nWhile there is rarely much traffic present, most vehicles run on diesel and pollution on major roadways can be severe. A national speed limit of 80 km\/h is usually observed; village speed limits are all but entirely ignored, but drivers slow down for several speed humps distributed within each village.  Seat belts are advised on taxis but are rarely evident and apparently never used.\n\nRoad travel tends to be more dangerous than many people are used to, and many embassies advise their citizens to avoid pretty much any form of road travel. Pot holes, washouts and dilapidated bridges are commonplace. Buses are the best, unless you are truly comfortable and capable of renting and driving a car on your own - most people are not even if they think they are. Avoid travel at night, especially outside of urban areas. Another option is hop-on, hop-off bus passes which allow you to tour Fiji at your own pace for a fixed price.

Inter-island ferries are reasonably priced and the larger ones (especially those large enough to accommodate cars and trucks) have a good safety record, though they may be overcrowded at the beginning and end of school holiday periods. Ferries offer two or three classes (depending on the ship). Economy (F$65 pp on Suva-Taveuni route) is the cheapest option, but requires you to sleep on chairs or on the floor. Sleeper (F$104 pp, Suva-Taveuni) is dormitory-like accommodation. Cabin (F$135 pp on MV Suiliven, F$95 pp on SOFE, Suva-Taveuni) is not necessarily the best option, as the space is very limited, cabin can be shared (4 beds) and can have hords of bugs.\n\nDenarau Marina on Denarau Island is the gateway to the Mamanuca and Yasawa Island groups. This is where cruises and ferries servicing these islands operate from. Denarau island is connected to the mainland via a short bridge, and is just 20 minutes from Nadi International Airport.\n\nDo not attempt to take a car to another island unless you own it or have made clear special arrangements - most rental companies forbid it and they do prosecute tourists who violate this clause in the contract.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Bicycle"]},"\nBicycles are becoming more popular in Fiji in recent years for locals and tourists alike.

Cycling is a great way to see Fiji but make sure you carry all your own spares and supplies as bike shops are scarce. It is a good idea to carry plenty of water, a camelbak is great, as it is very hot and humid almost year round.\n\nThe main road around the largest island, Viti Levu, is sealed except for a 40km section on the east side.

Travelers have reported the regularity of petty robberies, muggings, and also home-invasions\/rape, etc.  You will notice the predominance of bars on most peoples' homes. Economic and ethnic strife has led to a low-level hum of violent crime. Some resorts and hotels have more extensive security measures than others which should be taken into account.\n\nMuggings are often carried out by large groups of men so being in a group won't necessarily be a deterrent. Police forces sometimes have difficulties responding to crime, potentially for reasons as mundane as being unable to pay for petrol.\n\nFijian culture encourages sharing and sometimes small things like shoes will be \"borrowed\". Often by speaking with the village chief it can be arranged to get things returned.\n\nFiji is still run by a military government, following a coup in December 2006.  Although its effect has not been prominent in the resort areas of Nadi, it has led to economic decline, and a decrease in the rule of law.  Journalists may be blacklisted for political reasons.  Those whose employment involves reporting controversial political activities should take extra care to ensure that their visas are in order before visiting Fiji.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\nFiji is relatively free of disease compared to most of the tropics. Avoid mosquito-borne illnesses, such as dengue fever and even elephantiasis by covering up thoroughly or using repellents while outdoors at dawn or dusk. Local water is generally safe, though filtering or boiling is advisable when unsure. Urban tap water is treated and nearly always safe. When exceptions occasionally arise, there are public warnings or radio and print media warnings. Contaminated food is uncommon, though on occasion, mature reef fish can contain mild neurotoxins they accumulate in their bodies from freshwater algaes that wash into the ocean. The effects of such \"fish-poisoning\" are usually intense for only a day or two, but tingling lips and unusual sensitivities to hot and cold can linger for a long time.\n\nDrownings are common, and automobile and other motor vehicle accidents (often involving animals or pedestrians) are very common. Local emergency medical care is very good on the basics in urban areas. Expect long waits in government-run clinics and hospitals. Treatment for serious conditions often requires an evacuation to New Zealand or Australia. Even the most basic medical care is usually not available outside of urban areas.\n\nFiji, like most of the South Pacific, can have intense solar radiation that can cause severe skin-burns in a short amount of time.  Be sure to use hats, sunglasses and liberal amounts of high-SPF value sunblock on ALL exposed skin (including ears, noses and tops-of-feet) when out in the sun. On top of that tropical boils are a common inconvenience in Fiji, this can be avoided by giving those sweaty sections of the body a soapy scrub more than once a day.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Respect"]},"\nFiji, like many Pacific Island states, has a strong ",{"type":"''","value":["Christian"]}," moral society; having been colonised and converted to Christianity by missionaries during the 19th century. Do not be surprised if shops and other businesses are closed on Sunday. The Sabbath starts at 6PM the day before, and some businesses celebrate the Sabbath on a Saturday instead of a Sunday. Many Indians are Hindu or Muslim.\n\nAlso, dress modestly and appropriately. While Fiji is a tropical country, beach-wear should be confined to the beach. Take your cues from the locals as to what they consider appropriate dress for the occasion.  When visiting towns and villages, you should be sure to cover your shoulders and wear shorts or ",{"type":"''","value":["sulus"]}," (sarongs) that cover your knees (both genders). This is especially true for visiting a church, although locals will often lend you a ",{"type":"''","value":["sulu"]}," for a church visit.\n\nThere is no nudist\/naturalist or topless bathing in Fiji.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\nPublic phones are numerous and usually easy to find (look around shops). All phones are prepaid - you must first purchase scrape-off code card (F$5, F$10 or more nominals). Calling is done by calling card issuer center, entering the code (found on the card) and entering the destination number. Foreign call to Europe is approx. F$1 per minute.\n\nThere are a few mobile phone companies operating on the island (Vodafone, Digicel). A sim-card is inexpensive, but you need to register your sim to keep it active and to get access to data. Buying a sim-card gives access to cheap data-packages for easy internet access using your phone as a hot-spot. It is much cheaper than resort Wi-Fi, and speed is reasonable with the connections in the tourist areas. \nAt time of writing (July 2013) these were the Vodafone data-package prices:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" 200 Mb (24 hour validity): 1.49 FJD"]},{"type":"*","value":[" 500 Mb (1 week validity): 4.99 FJD"]},{"type":"*","value":[" 2000 Mb (1 month validity): 25 FJD"]},{"type":"*","value":[" 4000 Mb (1 month validity): 45 FJD"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Melanesia"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecountry"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Geo"],["-18"],["179"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Fiji"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Oceania\/Fiji\/"]]}]
