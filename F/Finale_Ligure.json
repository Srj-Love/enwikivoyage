[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Finale Ligure"]}," is a town in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Liguria"]]}," of about 12'000 inhabitants. Finale Ligure consists of three formerly independent towns: Finalmarina (Finale Marina) close to the sea, Finalpia (Finale Pia) also on the sea and finally Final Borgo (Finalborgo) slightly inland. Today, the three parts are completely grown together, but the old center of each part can still be noticed. This is most obvious in Finalborgo, where the cosy old town with its small streets is still sourrounded by the original town wall. Finale Ligure is popular with families for the beaches, the climbers for the limestone mountains and the bikers.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Train"]},"\nThere are direct train connections from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Genova"]]}," about every 30 minutes (1 hour) and from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Milan"]]}," about every 2 hours (2.5 hours).
