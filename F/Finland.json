The Finno-Soviet Pact of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance committed Finland to resist armed attacks by \"Germany or its allies\" (read: the West), but also allowed Finland to stay neutral in the Cold War and avoid a Communist government or Warsaw Pact membership.   In politics, there was a tendency of avoiding any policies and statements that could be interpreted as anti-Soviet. This balancing act of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Finlandization"]}," was humorously defined as \"the art of bowing to the East without mooning the West\". Despite close relations with the Soviet Union, Finland managed to retain democratic multi-party elections and remained a Western European market economy, building close ties with its ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nordic countries"],["Nordic"]]}," neighbors.

Automated gas pumps in Finland in rare occasions do not accept foreign visa\/credit cards, but you can pay with Euro notes. In the sparsely-populated areas of the country, distances of 50 km and more between gas stations are not unheard of, so don't gamble unnecessarily with those last litres of fuel.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By taxi "]},"\nFinnish taxis are heavily regulated by the government, so they're comfortable, safe and expensive.  No matter where you go in the country, the starting fee is fixed at €5.50, rising up to €8.60 at night and on Sundays.  The per-kilometer charge starts at €1.43\/km for 1 or 2 passengers, rising up to €2,01\/km for 7 or 8 passenger (in minivans).  A 20–25 km journey (say, airport to central Helsinki) can thus easily cost €30-40. For really long journeys, the price can sometimes be negotiated.\n\nTaxis can come in any color or shape, but they will always have a yellow \"TAXI\" sign (sometimes spelled \"TAKSI\") on the roof.  Hailing cabs off the street is difficult to impossible, so either find a taxi rank or order by phone (any pub or restaurant will help you on this – expect to pay €2 for the call).  In towns you use the calling centre, in the countryside you might want to call a taxi company directly. Taxi companies around the country can be found at the Taksiliitto ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.taksiliitto.fi"]}," site or from local tourist services.\n\nIn city centres, long queues at the taxi stops can be expected on Friday and Saturday nights. The same is true at ferry harbours, railway stations and the like. It is not uncommon to share a taxi with strangers, if going towards the same general direction.\n\nUnlicensed taxis (",{"type":"''","value":["pimeä taksi"]},") may be found in the centres of large towns, particularly on nights and weekends, but their use is to be avoided. You might lose your wallet\/purse\/phone, get conned or even assaulted. This despite such crimes are generally unusual.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By thumb"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hitchhiking"]]}," is possible, albeit unusual, in Finland, as the harsh climate and sparse traffic don't exactly encourage standing around and waiting for cars.  The most difficult task is getting out of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Helsinki"]]},".  Summer offers long light hours, but in the fall\/spring you should plan your time.  The highway between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Helsinki"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saint Petersburg"]]}," has a very high percentage of Russian drivers.  See Hitchhiking Club Finland liftari.org ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.liftari.org"]}," or the Finland article ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/hitchwiki.org\/en\/Finland"]}," on Hitchwiki for further details if interested.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bicycle"]},"\nMost Finnish cities have good bike paths especially outside the centres, and taking a bike can be a quick, healthy and environmentally friendly method of getting around locally. Children under 12 years can use the pavement where there is no bike path, as long as they do not disturb pedestrians.\n\nThe roads are generally paved well, although gravel roads are sometimes unavoidable. As long as you don't go off-road, you will not need suspension or grooved tyres.\n\nBeware that a good bike path can end abruptly and force you out among the cars; the bike network building efforts are not too well coordinated. Also at road works, directions for bikers are often neglected\n\nBecause of the long distances, bicycle tourists are advised to plan well and be prepared to use public transport for the less interesting stretches. Long-distance coaches are well-equipped to take a few bicycles on board. Fares vary by company and distance, typically about half of an ordinary ticket. Packing the bike is not needed, but getting on at the bus station and arriving in time may help finding room for the bike. Trains take bicycles if there is enough space (varies by train type). Ferries usually take bikes for free or for a minimal charge.\n\nDue to the relatively gentle topographic relief, too hilly terrain is rarely a problem, but in the cold months, wind chill requires more protection against cold than in walking. In some municipalities bike paths are well maintained in winter, in others they are not. Biking among the cars in winter is usually too dangerous.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Joensuu river view.JPG"],["thumbnail"],["Night view across Pielisjoki river, Joensuu"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["seealso"],["Finnish phrasebook"],["Swedish phrasebook"]]},"\nFinland is officially bilingual in ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Finnish phrasebook"],["Finnish"]]}]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["suomi"]},") and ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Swedish phrasebook"],["Swedish"]]}]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["svenska"]},"), and both languages are compulsory in nearly all schools (with varying results).

It is not even an Indo-European language, instead belonging in the Uralic group of languages which includes Hungarian and Estonian, making it hard for speakers of most other European languages to learn. Reading signboards can also be difficult as Finnish has relatively few loan words from common European languages. The relation between spelling and formal pronunciation is straight forward (just learn how to pronounce individual letters – the difficulty lies in sticking to that), while colloquial speech differs substantially from what is taught in most language lessons.\n\nThe Finnish language has relatively few exceptions but quite many rules (where some rules might be considered cleverly disguised exceptions). There are about 17 different cases for \"getting ",{"type":"''","value":["some"]}," coffee and getting ",{"type":"''","value":["the"]}," coffee, going ",{"type":"''","value":["into"]}," a pub, being ",{"type":"''","value":["in"]}," a pub, getting ",{"type":"''","value":["out of"]}," the pub, being ",{"type":"''","value":["on"]}," the roof, getting ",{"type":"''","value":["onto"]}," the roof, getting ",{"type":"''","value":["off"]}," the roof, using something ",{"type":"''","value":["as"]}," roof\" and so on that are encoded into the word endings (kahvia, kahvi, pubiin, pubissa, pubista, katolle, katolta, kattona). The conjugation of verbs is unfortunately somewhat more complex.\n\nUsing a dictionary is complicated by the word inflection; also the stem of many words varies somewhat (e.g. roof, \"katto\", above). Many different words are formed from the same root by other endings (kirjain, kirjuri, kirjasin, kirjoitin, kirje, kirjelmä, kirjasto and kirjaamo are all substantives related to \"kirja\", book, and then there are related verbs and adjectives).\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Swedish"]},", closely related to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Norwegian"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Danish"]]},", is the mother tongue for 5.6% of Finns. There are no large cities with a Swedish majority, and the Swedish-speaking communities are mainly smaller towns and rural municipalities along the coast and minorities in the cities. Many towns and road signs on the coast use alternate Finnish and Swedish names, so road signs can be confusing. The small autonomous province of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Åland"]]}," and the municipalities of Närpes, Korsnäs and Larsmo are exclusively Swedish-speaking, and people there typically speak little or no Finnish, so English is a better bet. Swedish is a mandatory subject in Finnish-speaking schools since the 1970s (as Finnish in Swedish-speaking schools). In practice, it is rare to find fluent Swedish speakers outside cities and towns with a significant Swedish-speaking community – about half the population regard themselves conversant in it, though. For example, in Helsinki and Turku most people know enough Swedish to deal with simple conversations you engage in as a tourist and often at least somewhat beyond, but living would be quite tough without knowledge of Finnish, whereas in towns like Vaasa and Porvoo nearly half the population is Swedish-speaking and service in Swedish is expected by many Swedish speaking locals. Most larger hotels and restaurants in areas where Swedish is widely spoken do have Swedish-proficient staff.\n\nIn larger cities, with the exception of the elderly, nearly all people you could possibly meet as a tourist speak ",{"type":"'''","value":["English"]}," very well, and even in the countryside younger people will nearly always know enough to communicate. In fact, outside of the Swedish-speaking communities, English is usually far better understood than Swedish.

The more specialized the goods, the higher the gap between Finnish and international prices, and mail order may save a lot of money. When a package is intercepted by customs (which is quite rate for physically small items), the buyer is notified and can pick it up from customs. VAT and possibly import duty are charged, bring a copy of the order that is then signed by the buyer and archived.\n\nWhen buying consumer electronics, one should be aware that the shelf life of products can be rather long, especially if the shop isn't specialized in consumer electronics.

In ancient times, saunas (being the cleanest places around) were the place to give birth and heal the sick, and the first building constructed when setting up a new household.\n\nIf invited to visit a Finnish home, you may be invited to bathe in the sauna as well — this is an honor and should be treated as such, although Finns do understand that foreigners may not be keen about the idea. Enter the sauna nude after taking a shower, as wearing a bathing suit or any other clothing is considered a bit of a ",{"type":"''","value":["faux pas"]},", although if you are feeling shy, you can wrap yourself in a bath towel. (When there are guests, men and women usually bathe separately.)  The temperature is regulated by throwing water onto the stove (",{"type":"''","value":["kiuas"]},"): the resulting rush of heat, known as ",{"type":"''","value":["löyly"]},", is considered the key to the sauna experience. Some sauna-goers also like to flagellate themselves with leafy branches of birch (",{"type":"''","value":["vihta"]}," in western Finland, ",{"type":"''","value":["vasta"]}," in eastern Finland), which creates an enjoyable aroma and improves blood circulation.\n\nDepending on the occasion, the temperature in a Finnish sauna may start quite hot and gradually cool down over the hours, especially in a wood-heated sauna. The lower benches are cooler, the corner that is the furthest away from the stove is usually the hottest place.  If the heat is too much, cup your hands in front of your mouth or move down to a lower level to catch your breath.  After you've had your fill, you can cool off by heading outside, just to sit at the veranda, for a roll in the snow (in winter) or for a dip in the lake (any time of the year, beach sandals or the like can be practical in the winter) — and then head back in for another round.  Repeat this a few times, then cork open a cold beer, roast a sausage over a fire, and enjoy total relaxation Finnish style.\n\nIn \"public\" saunas (hotels, gyms and the like), it is customary to sit on a paper towel (don't forget to take it out when leaving). The environment is rather hostile towards germs, so there is no need to worry about catching a disease from the sweaty wooden bench.\n\nThese days the most common type of sauna features an electrically heated stove, which is easy to control and maintain.  In the countryside you can still find wood-fired saunas, but purists prefer the (now very rare) traditional chimneyless ",{"type":"'''","value":["smoke saunas"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["savusauna"]},"), where a large pile of stones is heated and the sauna then ventilated well before entering.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Anyone elderly or with a medical condition (especially high blood pressure) should consult their physician before using a sauna."]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Learn"]},"\nFinland's universities are generally well-regarded and offer many exchange programs, but the high cost of living and the prospect of facing the long, cold Finnish winter mean that the country is not a particularly popular choice.  However, there are ",{"type":"'''","value":["no tuition fees"]}," for regular degree students, including international exchange students.  While lectures are usually conducted in Finnish (or Swedish, as in Åbo Akademi), most advanced text books are in English.  It is often possible to complete all courses through assignments and exams in English.  There are also advanced courses and even whole programs in English, targeted at exchange students.  Many universities also offer the option to study Finnish (or Swedish) at various levels.\n\nA reasonable monthly budget (excluding rent) would be €600 to €900. Rents vary depending on location such that in Greater Helsinki and particularly Helsinki proper prices may be two times that of cheaper locations or student housing.  Many exchange programs fully or partly subsidize accommodation in student dorms. However, the state does not provide student accommodation and dorms are usually owned by student unions and foundations, which usually have waiting lists. Getting the apartment is the responsibility of student. Student union membership at around €70–100\/year is obligatory (for undergraduate studies), but this includes access to student health services.\n\nEU citizens can simply enter the country and register as a student after arrival, while students from elsewhere will need to arrange their residence permit beforehand.

Publicly posted positions are usually highly competitive, and usually require both a degree or a professional qualification and specific work experience. Thus, informal channels or assistance from an experienced local are valuable.\n\nA rapidly growing trend in Finland, especially for the younger generation, is to work for placement agencies. Although there has been a massive surge of public companies going private in the last ten years, this trend seems to be fueled by the increased demand for more flexible work schedules as well as the freedom to work seasonally or sporadically. Due to the nature of these types of agencies as well as the types of work they provide, it is common for them to hire non-Finns. Some agencies include Adecco, Staff Point, Manpower, Aaltovoima and Biisoni.\n\nFor ",{"type":"'''","value":["summer jobs"]},", such as trainee positions for university students, the search begins very early, around January, and application periods end in late March. Last-minute positions opening in May are very few and quickly taken.\n\nIf you are invited to a job interview, remember that modesty is a virtue in Finland. Finns appreciate facts and directness, so stay on topic and be truthful. Exaggeration and bragging is usually associated with lying.  You can check expected salaries with the union for your field, as they usually have defined minimum wages.  Salaries range from €1,200 - €6,500 per month (2010) for full-time jobs.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],[{"type":"[[","value":[["Risks"]]}," in Finland"],["Crime\/violence: ",{"type":"'''","value":["Low"]},{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\n",{"type":"<","value":["small",["Most violence is alcohol-related and\/or domestic – walking in the street is usually safe even in the night"]]},{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\nAuthorities\/corruption: ",{"type":"'''","value":["Low"]},{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\n",{"type":"<","value":["small",["The police are generally courteous and speak some English, offering bribes will get you into serious trouble."]]},{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\nTransportation: ",{"type":"'''","value":["Low"]}," to ",{"type":"'''","value":["Moderate"]},{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\n",{"type":"<","value":["small",["Icy roads and sidewalks in the winter, mooses and other animals occasionally crossing the roads"]]},{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\nHealth: ",{"type":"'''","value":["Low"]},{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\n",{"type":"<","value":["small",["Tick and mosquito bites"]]},{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\nNature: ",{"type":"'''","value":["Low"]}," to ",{"type":"'''","value":["Moderate"]},{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\n",{"type":"<","value":["small",["Blizzards in the winter, getting lost when hiking in the forests"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Crime"]},"\nFinland enjoys a comparatively low crime rate and is, generally, a very safe place to travel.

As usual, mosquitoes are most active around dawn and sunset — which, in the land of the Midnight Sun, may mean most of the night in summer. There are many different types of mosquito repellents available which can be bought from almost any shop.

Contrary to popular belief abroad, there are no polar bears in Finland, let alone polar bears walking on the city streets.\n\nIn winter, lakes and the sea are frozen. Walking, skating or even driving a car on the ice is commonly seen, but fatal accidents aren't unheard of either, so ask and heed local advice. If the ice fails, it is difficult to get back out of the water, as the ice will be slippery. Ice picks are sold as safety equipment (a pair of steel needles with bright plastic grips, connected with a safety line). Stay calm, shout for help, break the ice in the direction you came from, get up, creep away and get indoors with no delay. Help from somebody with a rope, a long stick or any similar improvized aid might be needed (no use having both of you in the water).\n\nGiven the size of the Finnish population, a surprisingly high number of people drown in the lakes every year in summer. As pointed out by an annual public awareness campaign (partly Finnish black humour, partly the truth), the stereotypical accident involves an intoxicated fisherman who capsizes his boat while standing up to pee.\n\nFinnish healthcare is mostly public, in particular intensive care, advanced and emergency healthcare, provided by municipal, central or university hospitals.

Common sense is quite enough in most situations, but there are a couple of things that one should keep in mind:\n\nFinns are a famously ",{"type":"'''","value":["taciturn"]}," people who have little time for small talk or social niceties, so don't expect to hear phrases like \"thank you\" or \"you're welcome\" too often.  The Finnish language lacks a specific word for \"please\" so Finns sometimes forget to use it when speaking English, with no intention to be rude. Also lacking in Finnish is the distinction between \"he\" and \"she\", which may lead to confusing errors.  Loud speaking and loud laughing is not normal in Finland and may irritate some Finns. Occasional silence is considered a part of the conversation, not a sign of hostility or irritation. Notice that although the phrase ",{"type":"''","value":["mitä kuuluu"]}," translates to \"how are you\", it has a literal meaning in Finnish, i.e. a longer discussion is expected; it is not a part of the greeting as in English.\n\nAll that said, Finns are generally helpful and polite, and glad to help confused tourists if asked. The lack of niceties has more to do with the fact that in Finnish culture, ",{"type":"'''","value":["honesty"]}," is highly regarded and that one should open one's mouth only to mean what one is about to say. Do not say \"maybe later\" when there is no later time to be expected. A visitor is unlikely to receive many compliments from Finns, but can be fairly sure that the compliments received are genuine. Especially younger Finns speak usually excellent English due to the policy of subtitling foreign language movies and TV series instead of dubbing them. However, particularly in Northern Finland there is a strong religious movement (laestadianism) which considers watching television and listening popular music as sin. This may explain why English is not as widely spoken in Northern Finland as it is in the south of the country.\n\nAnother highly regarded virtue in Finland is ",{"type":"'''","value":["punctuality"]},". A visitor should apologize even for being a few minutes late. Being late for longer usually requires a short explanation. 10 min is usually considered the threshold between being \"acceptably\" late and very late. Some will leave arranged meeting points after 15 min. With the advent of mobile phones, sending a text message even if you are only a few minutes late is nowadays a norm. Being late for a business meeting, even by 1 or 2 min, is considered rude.\n\nThe standard greeting is a ",{"type":"'''","value":["handshake"]},". Hugs are only exchanged between family members and close friends in some situations, kisses, even on the cheek, practically never.\n\nIf you are invited to a Finnish home, the only bad mistake visitors can make is not to ",{"type":"'''","value":["remove their shoes"]},". For much of the year, shoes will carry a lot of snow or mud. Therefore, it is customary to remove them, even during the summer. During the wet season you can ask to put your shoes somewhere to dry during your stay. Very formal occasions at private homes, such as baptisms (often conducted at home in Finland) or somebody's 50th birthday party, are exceptions to these rules. In the wintertime, this sometimes means that the guests bring separate clean shoes and put them on while leaving outdoor shoes to the hall.
