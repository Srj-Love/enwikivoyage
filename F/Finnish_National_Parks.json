In addition there are national hiking areas, wilderness areas, nature reserves and some other protected or non-protected areas of interest to tourists. Some of the areas are mire, esker or old-growth forest protection areas or similar, where the protection concerns land owners and planning authorities and mostly is irrelevant for hikers.\n\nThe parks are open to the public without any entry or hiking fees. Many have services such as marked hiking paths, cottages, goahtis and saunas for rent. The ",{"type":"[[","value":[["right to access"]]}," is usually somewhat restricted in the parks, but the offered services should compensate that for most visitors. National parks and strict nature reserves are always on state owned land, but other protected areas may be on ground owned by other entities, even privately owned.\n\nThere are usually nature trails in the areas listed below. In all but the smallest areas, there are usually locations for rest (with campfire sites and pit toilets) and in the bigger ones hiking trails and some lodging facilities (often lean-to shelters, in the north more commonly also open wilderness huts).\n\nBerry and mushroom picking is usually allowed, in regard to edible species. Taking anything else from the nature is usually forbidden.\n\nInformation is usually available in English, but some may be in Finnish only, or Finnish and Swedish or Sami.\n\nMost of the really large parks are in the far north, in the Sami native region. Regulations of the parks try not to disturb the traditional livelihood of the Sami. Thus e.g. reindeer herding, hunting, fishing, taking wood for own needs and even driving are often allowed for the locals also were forbidden otherwise. The local population is sparse enough that this does not generally threaten the ecology of the areas (there are conflicts though, e.g. about number of reindeer that should be allowed and about large carnivores, which cause problems for the reindeer husbandry).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["National parks, hiking areas and wilderness areas"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["National parks"]}," are the prime destinations for those wanting to see Finnish nature other than normal countryside.

These are marked trails with information boards presenting the nature or other features of the area (seldom in English, but the images give a hint about what to look for). They are usually quite easy to walk, suitable also for families with small children and some even when using a wheelchair (assistance mostly needed, though). There may be a campfire site suitable for a picnic along the trail. Often you can book a guide to take the walk with you, which allows your learning much more.\n\nMarked ",{"type":"'''","value":["hiking trails"]}," are usually planned to allow experiencing the nature at its best, but you have to take your time. You are not supposed to hurry from one sight to the next. They are usually longer than the nature trails and thus allow getting deeper into the area. There are usually campfire sites and the like, to allow nice breaks on day trips. Longer trails usually have lean-to shelters, allowing overnight hikes without tent (but carrying a tent may be wise in many cases).\n\nHiking in the ",{"type":"'''","value":["backcountry"]}," you should immerse in the nature and the sights are all around you. You should of course choose your route so that you pass by some good examples of the typical or special nature of the area, get nice views from higher terrain or at the borders of lakes and treeless mires, and have time to look also at the small wonders.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Local culture "]},"\n\nTraces of human activity are presented in many national parks.\n\nFinland is sparsely populated, but that does not mean large areas would be untouched by man. The Finnish word for wilderness is \"erämaa\", which also means hunting grounds. People ventured far from their village to hunt and fish. Settling new areas was often encouraged by the crown and some landless people and adventurers built their home in what still is regarded as wilderness. And, of course, only some of the national parks are wilderness. Some have been regularly used, but have had some feature hindering extensive logging or turning them to farmland. In Lapland in the far north, where there are truly large national parks and wilderness areas, most land is still used for reindeer husbandry, introduced in large scale by Northern Sami. The statutes of national parks often explicitly encourage traditional livelihood. The most prominent example is probably the Archipelago Sea National Park, where the park is trying to help keeping the archipelago inhabited.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Historical sites "]},"\n\nThere are often traces of the normal lives of people of the past, sometimes remnants of farms, or even well preserved ones. Some trails have a long history, such as the Ruija trail, used to get to the Barents Sea coast before there were roads or the post route in Muotkatunturit. In many parks by the east border there are structures from the war.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" The visitors centres "]},"\n\nMost visitor centres have exhibitions that can be seen for free, in a few cases for a fee. Some are quite large. Groups can book guiding for a fee, sometimes it is also possible to join a regular guided tour. There are often also audiovisual shows, at regular intervals or at request, and nature trails. The personnel should be happy to give advice on what sights would suite your timetable and interests.\n\nThe Metsähallitus customer service points and nature information huts are more modest but sometimes really worth a visit.

Near some destinations there are also proper restaurants. At most destinations you will not find any meals inside the area, other than what you cook yourself – or have a wilderness guide prepare for you (also without a guide you may be able to have a local business bring you meals).\n\nPicking edible mushrooms and berries is often allowed also when collecting other things is strictly forbidden. Fishing is often allowed with the usual restrictions (general and local fishing permit needed for most fishing). Hunting is allowed in some protected areas (not in national parks or nature reserves), with normal restrictions.\n\nGood looking water in springs, streams and even lakes is often potable untreated, but cooking it may be recommended. In some areas water has to be brought. There may be wells or other water sources provided. The authorities make tests to evaluate the general quality of natural water in many of the areas, but give no guaranties, except where a specific water source has been tested and recommended (typically tap water or a well).\n\nThere are designated camp fire places in many areas, allowing cooking at the camp fire, given wildfire warnings are not in effect. In the backcountry campfires may be allowed also elsewhere. There are stoves in the wilderness huts. A camping stove is recommended, though, for any serious hiking.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Wilderness Hut Finland.jpg"],["thumb"],["Open wilderness hut near the treeline, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pallas-Yllästunturi National Park"]]},"."]]},"\n\nThere are lots of commercial lodging facilities near at least some popular parks – but if you are going to spend more than a day in the park, you should look also at other options.\n\nIn the national parks of northern Finland there are ",{"type":"'''","value":["open wilderness huts"]}," providing accommodation for free.

They might have a rowing boat, sauna and similar.\n\nGoing to the south, open wilderness huts get sparse. As winters are less severe here, you can get away without them. Instead there are ",{"type":"'''","value":["lean-to shelters"]},", where you can spend the evening by a campfire and get shelter from rain in the night.\n\nThe main option is of course a ",{"type":"'''","value":["tent"]},". You might want to carry one even if you plan to sleep indoors, especially if using open wilderness huts in peek season (get warm and dry in the hut, but sleep in the tent, if you suspect another party may arrive later) or hiking in severe conditions (where you might not reach the hut before dark).\n\nThere are seldom proper camping areas in the parks. Instead you can put your tent near provided infrastructure, such as open wilderness huts and campfire places (in some busy parks only designated areas are to be used, but the facilities are similar). In the backcountry of larger parks you can usually put your tent anywhere but in a few restricted areas.\n\nWhen visiting smaller areas without facilities, you can still use your tent: sleeping in the wood outside the area for a night or two is allowed by the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["right to access"]]},", provided due consideration.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Open Wilderness Hut in the Riisitunturi national park, Riisitunturi national park.jpg"],["thumb"],["Open wilderness huts are invaluable in the winter of Lapland.

The European adder is the only poisonous snake (see ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Finland"]]}," for advice). There are bears and wolves, especially in eastern Finland, but they avoid humans. As long as you do not manage to get between a bear and her cubs or let your dog find and provoke a bear, you should be pretty safe (they have not learnt to come after your food).\n\nThe ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pests#Ticks"],["ticks"]]}," carry Lyme disease or TBE in some areas, both potentially nasty. You might want to take precautions.\n\nMosquitoes are a non-trivial nuisance in many of the areas in summer, especially in the north and by wetlands. Hundreds of stings may even make you ill. Make sure you have plenty of repellent at hand, a hat with a mosquito net (in the worst areas) and a mosquito proof tent. Black flies (breeding in streams, not still water, and thus more common in the north) are even worse, as they will find any small hole in your protection. \n\nAnother little beast, which can drive people crazy, is the deer fly (",{"type":"''","value":["hirvikärpänen"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["älgfluga"]},"). This poor flat fly crawls around in your hair and clothing in the hopeless quest of finding the deer in you. After having cut off its wings it has no choice but to continue, even realizing its mistake. They are harmless and seldom bite humans, but rather difficult to chase away or squeeze.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Norwegian or Swedish National Parks"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["PartOfTopic"],["Natural attractions‎"],["Scandinavia"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usabletopic"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:List of national parks of Finland"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:National Parks of Finland"]]}]
