Finnmark is much wider than for instance Belgium or the Netherlands. Large parts of the county consists of the ",{"type":"''","value":["Finnmarksvidda"]}," plateau at about 300 to 500 meters above sea level. Finnmark's rugged coastline totals about 6800 km if islands are included (more than the coastline of Spain or Chile).  Kautokeino municipality is about 10,000 square kilometers (4 times wider than Luxembourg) with a population of less than 3,000.\n\nFinnmark is Norway's coldest area, but it varies over county. The interior has a continental climate with winter temperatures down to -40°C (record -50°C), while summers can be warm. Karasjok for instance has an ",{"type":"''","value":["annual"]}," average at -2°C. The coast has chilly summers, and winters that are not so cold but windy (the open sea is ice free in winter). The town of Vardø has an arctic climate as even July has a monthly average at 9°C, like most of the outer coastline of Finnmark.\n\nDuring summer there is a long period of midnight sun (24 hour sun) and vice versa there is in winter a long period where sun is below the horizon (polar night or \"dark period\"). In ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alta"]]}," the polar night lasts from November 25 to January 17.\n\nFinnmark was largely destroyed during world war II. The eastern part of Finnmark was on the eastern front, and the small town of Kirkenes was subjected to more than 300 bomb raids. When the occupant forces retreated to Troms, they applied scorched earth strategy, where most buildings were destroyed.
