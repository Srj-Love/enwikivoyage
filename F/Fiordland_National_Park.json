Its rugged landscape remains one of the least explored areas of New Zealand. Although the park has about 500 km of formed walking tracks, these are mostly confined to eastern and northern parts of the park.\n\nLike all of New Zealand's national parks, it is managed by the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Department of Conservation"]}," (DOC). The department aims to allow the public to enjoy the park, while also preserving the environment. There are relatively few restrictions on access by individual visitors, though commercial activity is carefully (some might say strictly) controlled.\n\nThe main visitor information centre is in the township of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Te Anau"]]},". There are park ranger outposts at major visitor locations.  Visitors intending to stay in the park overnight are advised to inform the park rangers of their intentions.  In the event of an emergency, these intentions will be used as part of any search and rescue operation. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\nThe area is so remote and unexplored that some speculate that species thought extinct in New Zealand may still live in the park.

Visitors should always be prepared for rain, which can be heavy and prolonged. The park has over 200 rain days per year, though different parts of the park receive widely different rainfalls.  Te Anau, with 1200mm (40 inches) annual rainfall is almost as dry as much of the eastern South Island, while Milford Sound, with 8000mm (320 inches) annual rainfall, is truly rainforest and waterfall territory.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Aircraft"]},"\n\nAircraft are part of the Fiordland National Park scene. DOC uses them to carry out its duties in the park, including pest control. Aircraft service the walking track and remove every bit of waste, including toilet waste. As there are no roads, all lodge, track maintenance and building is enabled by aircraft and all supplies to the lodges are flown in. If you injure yourself so you can't continue or you go missing, aircraft are the only practical method to carry out search and rescue. For many people the only way they can access the park is by aircraft either because of lack of time, age or infirmity. The other important consideration is that aircraft make the least real environmental impact of any of the users of the park.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["State Highway 94"]},".
