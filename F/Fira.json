Up the stairs behind the bus station and across a parking lot to the west is the main taxi stand. \n\nA public restroom is located at the southern end of the taxi stand. There is a crazed woman who confiscates the toilet paper from the toilets in the mornings, and then accosts patrons as they enter, demanding 50 euro cents for a couple of sheets of toilet paper. She follows people into the restroom and continues to harass them while they use the facilities. Bring your own napkins, and try to ignore her.\n\nAnother great way to get around the (small) island is by hiring a quad bike (usually named \"ATV\") from numerous locations in the main tourist villages. for €20 a day, it is better value than taxis and more fun than a bus.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Definitely pay a visit to the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Santorini#Historic_Sights"],["Museum of Prehistoric Thira"]]},", where the story of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Santorini#Historic_Sights"],["Akrotiri"]]}," and other ancient settlements is vividly told through a stunning collection of Neolithic and Bronze Age artifacts.
