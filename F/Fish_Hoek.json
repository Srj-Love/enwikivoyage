There is also a good suburban railway ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.capemetrorail.co.za"]}," link with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cape Town"]]}," to the north and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Simon's Town"]]}," to the south. As a coastal suburb of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cape Town"]]},", Fish Hoek is popular as a residence for commuters and holidaymakers alike. The traditional industries of 'trek' fishing and angling co-exist with the leisure pursuits of surfing, kayaking, sailing and sunbathing.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Fish Hoek from Elsie's Peak.jpg"],["thumb"],["Fish Hoek Beach"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["style"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nFish Hoek or Vissers Baay or Visch Hoek appears on the earliest maps of the Cape. The arrival of European settlers in 1652 forced the indigenous population to leave the area, and during the 1700s farmers appeared in the Noordhoek area. Fish Hoek beach was used on an informal basis for whaling and fishing, but it was not until 1918 that it was laid out as a township.\n\nThe first grant of Crown Land in Fish Hoek was granted to Andreas Bruins in 1818. The land was sold several times before being bought by Hester Sophia de Kock in 1883. She was then a spinster of 51 years old. In 1901, late in life, she married a local farmer, one Jacob Isaac de Villiers who came to live with her on the farm.\n\nAlthough she farmed wheat and vegetables she started providing accommodation for people who wanted to stay in Fish Hoek, and so became the first local tourist entrepreneur. Fish Hoek has remained, with its situation and views, a beacon of extraordinary accommodation ever since. Having realized that Fish Hoek was becoming popular she left instructions in her will that the farm was to be surveyed and the land sold as building plots, after the deaths of Hester and Jacob, the land was sold off, the first sale taking place in 1918.\n\nThis was the beginning of the town of Fish Hoek. Initially people built holiday cottages but as there was a good train service to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cape Town"]]}," a more permanent community soon arose. By 1940 it was big enough to be declared a municipality and was administered by the Town Council until 1994. It is now part of the City of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cape Town"]]},".\n\nHester and Issac de Villiers, with other members of their family are buried in the small graveyard next to the NG Kerk (Dutch Reformed Curch) in Kommetjie Road.\n\nThe farmhouse on the site of the present Homestead Naval Mess near the railway crossing became an hotel. The original building subsequently burned down in 1947.\n\nOpen boat whaling took place in Fish Hoek from 1817 to 1868 where Southern Right and Humpback whales were targeted. The whalers would attack female whales who had arrived to calve, and their newborn. Eventually all the whaling operations were closed down, and nowadays the whales know that it is safe return, and come to False Bay to calve. Whales can be seen from about August to the end of November, however sometimes they arrive as early as June.\n\nIn the early days of European settlement False Bay was teeming with fish. Trek fishing has taken place ever since. Harders and yellowtail are the fish most frequently caught but nowadays in greatly reduced numbers. \"Trek\" is Dutch for pull and refers to the pulling in of the net.\n\nThe original barn of the Fish Hoek Farm now called Mountain View can be seen in Cottage Lane. It has been converted into two cottages and is not open to the public.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Car"]},"\n\nThere are 3 main routes to Fish Hoek :\n\nFrom the ",{"type":"'''","value":["north"]}," : Via the Main Road (M4) along the east coast of the peninsula.
