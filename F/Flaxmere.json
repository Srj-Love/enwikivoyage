It was originally intended as a housing development area so Hastings could continue to grow without damaging the valuable horticultural land of the Heretaunga Plains, although it is still technically built on the Heretaunga Plains. Because of this Flaxmere is built on poor soil, and not much grows there. In recent times the value of the gravel-filled soil that Flaxmere is built around has been recognized, leading to a proliferation of vineyards. These vineyards produce some of the best wine in the world.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Turn left at the huge roundabout where Omahu road leaves Hastings and crosses ",{"type":"'''","value":["State Highway 2a"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" Enter near Flaxmere from the Bridge Pa aerodrome"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nBeing a suburb that was planned with modern town planning knowledge (about 1964) Flaxmere has many large and varied green spaces that are good value to explore.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Flaxmere Park"]},".
