Originally the home of numerous General Motors factories, including the Buick World Headquarters, Flint has fallen on hard times over the past 30 years due to the decline of the American automotive industry.  Despite these misfortunes, the city has an outsized history, including decisive roles in the growth of the American labor movement and community schooling and evident in a host of extensive and well-endowed cultural institutions.  Flint's crime numbers have rised dramatically in recent years and funding for redevelopment projects has topped $400 million.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nSometimes considered a suburb of Detroit, Flint is more accurately described as a \"satellite\" city.  Like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saginaw"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pontiac (Michigan)"],["Pontiac"]]},", and other factory towns in Michigan, Flint's identity is often influenced and predicted by the Motor City and the peaks and valleys of the American auto industry.  Because these cities, and debatably Flint most of all, have become symbols of urban blight and economic ruin, it is tempting to write them off at the worst as ghost-towns, or at the best as smaller clones of Detroit.  In fact, each city is regionally distinct, both in terms of the local institutions they have raised in times of prosperity and crisis, and in the emphasis of civic response.  \n\nIn Flint's case, for example, the imprint of Charles Stewart Mott, General Motor's most famous philanthropist, often overshadows that of Billy Durant, who actually founded the corporation.  Streets, parks, estates, neighborhoods, colleges, and lakes have been named after Mott and his family, and the Mott Foundation funds and supports many cultural events here.  But this reverence toward a more glorious past is just as often tempered by frustration with its side-effects and outcome.  The bulk of Sloan Museum (see below), for example, is a measured analysis of the opportunities and hazards of rapid industrialization.  Much recent literature to come out of Flint, such as Rhonda Sanders ",{"type":"''","value":["Bronze Pillars"]}," focuses on the vitality of the African-American community, and its struggle against housing compacts and discrimination in the factories.  It is true that many other communities have struggled with these very issues in recent decades, but the height from which Flint has fallen -- from Michigan's \"second city\" and acknowledged birthplace of the world's largest corporation to an international symbol of crime and poverty -- has left deep scars on Flintites (or Flintstones; another heady debate in these parts).\n\nUnderstanding Flint requires understanding that its situation is more complex than that presented by the media, whether this is the General Motors filmstrips of the 1950s, or the Michael Moore film.  This means that there is more to the place than vacant lots and shuttered factories: The Flint Institute of Arts and annual jazz festival are comparable with cities many times this size, and a lively regional music scene is rooted in such venues as the Machine Shop and the Local 432.  One should be aware, however, that any visit is likely to become a referendum on the successes and failures of the American Dream.  There is a lot to see and do in Flint, but much of this may be of a sobering and thoughtful effect; certainly a far cry from the dunes of Lake Michigan or Ann Arbor's boutiques.  Flintstones (or Flintites) will be open and generous in pointing you to the best bars, restaurants, museums, and parks; they will also give you their own candid thoughts on the plight of their city.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Flint & Genesee Convention and Visitors Bureau"],["url=http:\/\/www.flintandgenesee.org\/visit\/"],["email=dstableford@flintandgenesee.org"],["address=519 S.

Even after one considers the time and effort saved here, there is something singularly appropriate about traveling the boulevards and parkways, the industrial zones and factory strips, in the vehicle this city helped popularize.  Of course, it also helps that Flint is a delight to drive, with a coherent network of roads and expressways linking the city to the suburbs, and abundant parking and a lack of congestion (ironically due to Flint's recent depopulation).  Among the city's much-touted $400 million redevelopment efforts are miles of infrastructural repaving and repair, and it is generally possible to get between any two points of the city in ten or fifteen minutes, or to access the remotest suburbs in well under an hour.\n\nThe streetscape of Flint is based on two grids, one which conforms to the river for several square miles in proximity to Downtown, and another which is cardinally oriented.  While Flint by-and-large conforms to its grids, there is enough topographical variation to cause many roads to split and angle.  Some major roads the follow this pattern are Welch Blvd., Flushing Rd., Chevrolet Ave., Miller Rd., Sagniaw St., and Dort Hwy.  Within some neighborhoods, the broader streets become curving boulevards with grassy medians, and sometimes this is the only relic of a formerly affluent area.\n\nFew roads Downtown now are one way with the four of them are north-south streets: Beach, Church, Harrison and Wallenberg.  Saginaw Street bisects this area from north to south, and dividing east and west addresses, while the bridge at Saginaw street divides the city into north and south.\n\nIn the larger grid, neighborhoods are divided by major \"mile\" roads: to the north (running east-west) one passes Hamilton or Davison, Pasadena, Pierson, and Carpenter, to the south (running east-west) Court, Lippincott, Atherton, and Hemphill (on the half-mile), to the east (running north-south), Lewis, Dort, and Center, and to the west (running north-south) Fenton or Saginaw, Dupont, and Ballenger or Clio.  It will be important to have a map: while these roads are generally straight, they don't always connect up as one would expect, and it should be easy to navigate as long as you can maintain a basic orientation.\n\nFor getting around the city quickly, though, and for reaching most of the suburbs, nothing is faster than Flint's four expressways: I-69, I-75, I-475, and US-23.  A trained Flintite can use this network of 70mph roads to go from a coney at Angelo's (see below) to a shake at the Atlas (see below) in about five minutes.  I-75 runs to the west of Flint, with access (from south to north) to I-475, US-23 (only driving south) Bristol, I-69, Miller, Corunna, Pierson, Mt. Morris, and 475 again.  I-475 runs through east Flint proper (meeting up with 75 outside the city) with access (from south to north) to Hill, Bristol, Hempill, Atherton, I-69, Court (only driving south), Robert T. Longway, Davison\/Hamilton, Stewart, Pierson, Carpenter, Saginaw St. (in Mt. Morris), Clio Rd., and I-75.  I-69 runs through south Flint proper with access (from east to west) to Center, Dort, I-475, Saginaw, Hammerberg, and I-75.  US-23 splits from I-75 just south of Flint, serving the south suburbs.\n\nWith a map in your hand, this network is not only sane; it is comprehensible and convenient.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By bicycle "]},"\n\nFlint currently has little in the way of bicycling trails, although development is planned to extend these further throughout the city and suburbs, particularly throughout the West Side.  The most extensive bike route is currently the Flint River Trail which extends north from downtown Flint to the city of Genesee on the Halloway Reservoir.  Other routes link the Riverfront trail to Downtown, the Cultural Center, and Kearsley Park.\n\nDue to Flint's relatively compact size, many attractions are within a short distance of each other by bike.  Cyclists are urged to use caution, however, especially on major thoroughfares such as Robert T. Longway or Chavez Drive, as traffic can be fast and heavy, and hills and curves tend to obstruct vision for both cyclists and motorists.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Friends of the Flint River Trail"],["url=http:\/\/www.flintriver.org\/"],["email=whatsupdowntown@comcast.net"],["address=432 North Saginaw St., Suite 238"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +1 810 767 6490"],["tollfree="],["fax=810-424-5484"],["hours="],["price="],["content=Affiliated with the Flint River Watershed Coalition, the Friends of the Flint River Trail sponsor bike rides along the train every Sunday from May through October.
