Some of these dams are quite extensive and difficult to portage. Great Falls until just above Fort Benton white water conditions apply and it is generally only navigable by raft or other whitewater type boats. From the traditional head of steamboat navigation at Fort Benton, Montana to where it joins the Mississippi River at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saint Louis"]]}," is mainly free of obstruction. \n\nBelow Fort Benton it is possible to float by canoe or powerboat the entire length. However the river is a series of alternating free floating stretches interrupted by lakes backed up behind major dams. Often it is necessary to portage around the dams. Generally the free flowing areas and lakes are 150 miles or longer. Thus any particular segment makes a very reasonable trip. Some segments are more suitable for powerboats, some more suitable for canoes. \n\nPrimitive camping along the river is generally necessary, although there are many towns with fancier accommodations. Legal access to campsites is possible in the entire Montana portion. Missouri has an extensive ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.missouririverwatertrail.org\/ water trail"]}," program with designated campsites every few miles. Policies in the other states vary. Check carefully before going.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Prepare "]},"\n \nCareful preparation and planning is necessary. Much of the river through Montana and the Dakotas is very remote and you will be entirely dependent on you own resources. Cell phone coverage varies from non--existent to spotty. Find out boating and camping regulations. \n\nMake sure you have the proper boat and equipment and know how to use it. Carry adaquate drinking and cooking water. Mark Twain is reputed to have said \"The Missouri River is too thick to drink, and too thin to plow.\" Aside from the river's heavy silt load, there may be runoff containing agricultural chemicals.\n\nMontana Stream Access Law (",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/fwp.mt.gov\/fishing\/guide\/access\/streamAccess.html"]},")- \"all water capable of recreational use can be so used by the public (between the ordinary high water marks) without regard to the ownership of the land underlying the waters.\" \nIf you are going to do any boating in Montana, this law will clarify your rights and responsibilities.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]}," \n\nIt is possible to get to selected launching points by highway.

It flows through beautiful prairie country. Scenic snags (logs) and shallow sandbanks are common. There are no known canoe outfitters for this reach, but if you can outfit yourself, it is possible to shuttle between Glascow or Wolf Point, Montana and Williston by Amtrak. \n\nAccess from the river is possible to the small towns of Poplar and Brockton Montana, located in the Fort Peck Indian Reservation.
