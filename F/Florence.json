The city is a cultural, artistic and architectural gem. The birthplace of the Italian Renaissance, Florence was the home to powerful families, creative geniuses and scientific masterminds who left their legacies in the city's many museums and art galleries.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Duomo from Palazzo Vecchio n01.jpg"],["350px"],["thumb"],["The Duomo"]]},"\nPolitically, economically, and culturally Florence was the most important city in Europe for around 250 years, from some time before 1300 until the early 1500s.\n\nFlorentines reinvented money, in the form of the gold florin. This currency was the engine that drove Europe out of the \"Dark Ages\", a term invented by Petrarch, a Florentine whose family had been exiled to Arezzo. They financed the development of industry all over Europe, from Britain to Bruges, Lyon and Hungary. They financed the English kings during the Hundred Years' War. They financed the papacy, including the construction of the papal palace in Avignon and the reconstruction of St. Peter's and the Vatican when the papacy returned to Rome from the \"Babylonian captivity\".\n\nDante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio pioneered the use of the vernacular, the use of a language other than Latin. In their case, Tuscan, which, because of them, became Italian. Because Dante, et al., wrote in Tuscan, Geoffrey Chaucer, who spent a lot of time in Northern Italy and who stole Boccaccio's little stories, wrote in English.  Others started writing in French and Spanish. This was the beginning of the end of Latin as a common language throughout Europe.\n\nThe Florentines, perhaps most notably Filippo Brunelleschi (1377-1466) and Leon Batist'Alberti (1404-1472) invented both Renaissance and neoclassical architecture. These architectural styles revolutionised the way Rome, London, Paris and every other major city in Europe from Barcelona to St. Petersburg were built.\n\nFlorentines were the driving force behind the Age of Discovery. Florentine bankers financed Henry the Navigator and the Portuguese explorers who pioneered the route around Africa to India and the Far East. It was a map drawn by the Florentine Paulo del Pozzo Toscanelli, a student of Brunelleschi, that Columbus used to sell his \"enterprise\" to the Spanish monarchs, and which he then used on his first voyage. Mercator's famous \"Projection\" is a refined version of Toscanelli's map, taking into account the Americas, of which the Florentine was obviously ignorant. The western hemisphere itself is named after a Florentine writer who claimed to be an explorer and mapmaker, Amerigo Vespucci.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Florence bridges.jpg"],["350px"],["thumb"],["Bridges over the Arno"]]},"\n\nGallileo and other scientists pioneered the study of optics, ballistics, astronomy, anatomy, and so on. Pico della Mirandola, Leonardo Bruni, Machiavelli, and many others laid the groundwork for our understanding of political science.\n\nOpera was invented in Florence.\n\nAnd that is just a smidgen of what went on in this city, which never had a population above 60,000 from the first attack of the plague in 1348 until long, long after it became unimportant.\n\nAnd there were the Medici, perhaps the most important family that ever lived. The Medici's changed the world more than any other family. Forget all the art for which they paid. They taught first the other Italians how to conduct state-craft, and then they taught the rest of the Europeans. Just to cite one example: Catherine de' Medici (1519-1589), married Henry II of France (reigned 1547-1559). After he died, Catherine ruled France as regent for her young sons and was instrumental in turning France into Europe’s first nation-state. She brought the Renaissance into France, introducing everything from the chateaux of the Loire to the fork. She also was to 16th and 17th century European royalty what Queen Victoria was to the 19th and 20th centuries – everybody’s grandmamma. Her children included three kings of France, Francis II (ruled 1559-1560), Charles IX (ruled 1560-1574) and Henry III (ruled 1574-1589). Her children-in-law included a fourth king of France, Henry IV (ruled 1589-1610), plus Elizabeth of Hapsburg, Philip II of Spain (of Armada fame), and Mary Queen of Scots.\n\nAnd that is without mentioning any \"artists\". From Arnolfo and Cimabue to Giotto, Nanni di Banco, and Uccello; through Lorenzo Ghiberti, and Donatello and Massaccio and the various della Robbias; through Fra Angelico and Botticelli and Piero della Francesca, and on to Michelangelo and Leonardo, the Florentines dominated the visual arts like nobody before or since. And this list does not include many who, in any other place would be considered among the greatest of artists, but in Florence must be considered among the near-great: Benvenuto Cellini, Andrea del Sarto, Benozzo Gozzoli, Domenico Ghirlandaio, Fra Lippo Lippi, Buontalenti, Orcagna, Pollaiuolo, Filippino Lippi, Verrocchio, Bronzino, Desiderio da Settignano, Michelozzo, the Rossellis, the Sangallos, Pontormo, just to name a few. And this list does not include the prolific Ignoto. Nor does it include the near-Florentines, such as Raphael, Andrea Pisano, Giambologna, the wonderfully nicknamed Sodoma and so many more, such as Peter-Paul Rubens, all of whom spent time in Florence and were educated by it.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Quarters "]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Regionlist"],["regionmap=Quartieri di Firenze.gif"],["regionmaptext=Florence's quarters"],["regionmapsize=400px"],["region1name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Florence\/Centro Storico"],["Centro Storico"]]}],["region1color=#ffd663"],["region1items="],["region1description="],["region2name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Florence\/Campo di Marte"],["Campo di Marte"]]}],["region2color=#ff3131"],["region2items="],["region2description="],["region3name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Florence\/Gavinana-Galluzzo"],["Gavinana-Galluzzo"]]}],["region3color=#5a7bff"],["region3items="],["region3description="],["region4name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Florence\/Isolotto-Legnaia"],["Isolotto-Legnaia"]]}],["region4color=#ce3973"],["region4items="],["region4description="],["region5name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Florence\/Rifredi"],["Rifredi"]]}],["region5color=#73d673"],["region5items="],["region5description="]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nFlorence's ",{"type":"'''","value":["Amerigo Vespucci"]}," international airport (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["FLR"]]},") (known to locals as \"Peretola\") ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.aeroporto.firenze.it\/"]}," has good connections to the center of the city, which can be reached in about fifteen minutes by taxi or bus.

You can buy the ticket on the bus.\n\nThere is a €25 flat rate for taxis from the airport to any place in the historic center of Florence. They will charge €1 extra for each piece of luggage handled by the driver.\n\nMuch cheaper flights to destinations throughout Europe can be found at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pisa"]]}," airport (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["PSA"]]},")",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.pisa-airport.it\/"]},".

Pisa airport and Florence are connected by rail and by bus. Both leave from and arrive at the main entrance to the airport. The bus station in Florence is immediately across the street from the main railroad station, \"Firenze SMN\". Train schedules are available at http:\/\/www.trenitalia.it. Bus schedules are available at http:\/\/www.terravision.eu\/florence_pisa.html. The train costs €7.80 one way, the bus costs €6 one way, and €10 for return. The buses run more often. Some trains do not arrive at the main railroad station, and others require a change at Pisa Centrale.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nModern, fast trains connect Florence with Italy's main cities, and local trains from other parts of Italy and express trains from around Europe arrive in Florence. The main station is ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.firenzesantamarianovella.it\/ Firenze Santa Maria Novella"]}]},", on the edge of the historic old town. Other small stations are ",{"type":"'''","value":["Firenze Campo Marte"]}," (near Florence Stadium) and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Firenze Rifredi"]},". If you take an Intercity train to Florence, you may need to change at Rifredi for another train to Firenze S.M.N. The transfer between stations via train is usually already covered by your train ticket (to check for this, your train ticket should not differentiate between the Florence train stations and will simply say \"Firenze\"). If you happen to have a long wait for the transferring train, it is also possible to take a bus to the city centre, but this is probably not covered by your train ticket.\n\nYou might want to consider the overnight train connections to Florence from Paris or most German towns. For example, the train from Florence to Munich leaves at 21:53 and arrives in Munich the next morning at around 08:00. You can sleep comfortably the entire way and it costs about €100. However, recent reports indicate that overnight train service in much of Europe - including the service between Florence and Paris - has deteriorated badly in recent years, and prices have risen. It is now much cheaper, and, of course, much faster, but not as beautiful and nice, to fly EasyJet from Paris - Orly to Pisa and take the approximately 1 hour train or bus ride from the Pisa airport to the main railroad station, Firenze SMN, in central Florence.\n\nThe train to Vienna takes about 12 hours and costs €70.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nFlorence is connected by good highways to the rest of Italy. The easiest way to get in and out of the city from the A-1 Autostrada, which connects Florence to Bologna, Milan and the North, and to Rome and the South, is to use the \"Firenze - Impruneta\" exit. This is the same route for those leaving for or arriving from Siena on the \"Fi-Si\" highway. If you are arriving from or leaving for Pisa and the West on the A-11 Autostrada, it may be best to go by way of Firenze-Scandicci and use the A-1 to connect to and from the A-11.\n\nDriving in the historic center - inside the wide \"viale\" where the old city walls were (and still are, on the southern side of the Arno)- is strictly prohibited, except for residents with permits. Enforcement is by camera, and is ferociously efficient. If you drive in the prohibited areas, you will be tracked down, and you will receive stiff fines in the mail.\n\nEvery 40 seconds, a motorist in Florence receives a traffic violation according to figures recently released by city officials. Traffic police issue approximately 90 tickets every minute, over 12,900 tickets a day.\n\nThe fines on these tickets average out to about €140 per year, per motorist, and they bring about 52 million to city hall each year, making it one of Italy's most heaviest fined cities. Local officials note that the amount of money that enters the municipal budget through traffic fines has tripled in the last 10 years.\n\nCentre-right councilors in Florence argue that the city issues much too many traffic violations. ‘A city that counts some 365,000 residents, should not be issuing traffic tickets that amount to €52 million. Milan (1,324,110 residents) in comparison issues €81 million in traffic fines, but it is considerably bigger than Florence.'\n\nOf the traffic violations that issued by traffic police in 2008, around a 54% were issued to motorists who entered the limited traffic zones (ZTL) without the required permit; a 29% were given to drivers who parked in no-parking zones; a 2.6% were issued for speeding; and a 0,009% were given for having run a red light.\n\nMost fines comes from ZTL violations. There is a very strictly defined route to get in and out of the city for car rental agencies in the Via Fineguerra and the Borg'Ognissanti, just south of the Firenze SMN railroad station. If you rent there, be sure to ask at the office how to get in and out without violating the ZTL.\n\nParking in garages and parking lots is expensive, costing €30 per night.\n\nThere are three kinds of parking places on the street: white, yellow and blue. White is for residents only, yellow ones are reserved, so you can park only on the blue places. The price is €1 per hour and you have to pay from 8AM to 8PM (12 hours). Leave the ticket inside the car in a visible place. Attention: you need coins for the parking - the machine won't accept banknotes or cards.\n\nYou can also find 'free' parking at all hours at \"Piazzale Michelangelo\" on the south side of the town. However, there are time limits for how long you can leave a car, which are rigidly enforced, and if you violate those limits, your car will be towed. It's about a 20 minute walk to the city centre (down the stairs and across the Arno). It has gorgeous views of the city as well.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nBus stops have clear, schematic labelling of the routes and are all named according to the street name or major landmark nearby. They do not always give an indication of bus times, however, so it is sometimes difficult to figure out how long it may take till the next bus arrives. Tickets must be bought in advance from Tobacconists or newspaper sellers, and are usually valid for one hour over the whole network, so that you can just hop on and off at will. They cost €1.20 for 90 minutes, and multiple day tickets are also available. Tickets are also available on the bus, sold by the driver, at an increased price of €2 (therefore, no more excuses in case of ticket control).\n\nBetter value is the €5 day ticket also from Tobacconists or news agents, best to add your name to the ticket and show your pass if needed by ticket control. Same as with cheaper. Tickets on first use need to be inserted into the ticket machine on the bus.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Firenze card"]},"\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["'Firenze Card"]}," (http:\/\/www.firenzecard.it\/) is a 72 hour pass for Florence allowing access to about 30 museums and free use of the public transport system.  In some museums you can queue jump the reservations procedure with the pass but it is best to check with individual museums.  The cost is €72 per person (as of July 2013).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Walking"]},"\nMost of the major tourist sights in Florence are within easy walking distance of each other. It is possible to walk from one end of the historic center of Florence to the other - North-South or East-West in a half hour. Walking is not only an easy way to get around, it also offers the chance to 'take in' much more of the city life. Be warned though, that electric motor scooters are small enough to fit where cars cannot.  They are silent but quick and in the summer they often travel into the plazas.  Some of the streets in central Florence are closed to traffic.  Many more are simply too narrow for buses to get through.  Therefore, bus and car tours are not recommended. This is a very small, very compact city that really needs to be seen by foot. And, of course, if you need to, you can always buy a new pair of shoes in Florence.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bicycle"]},"\nThere is a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["cycling"],["bike"]]}," rental service organized by the city. Bikes can be hired at several points in the city (and returned to the same place). One of the most convenient for tourists is located at SMN station. There are other locations at many railway stations, but often with restricted opening hours.\n\nWhile there are hills north and south of the center of town, almost all of the historic center of Florence is easy for bikers, because it is as flat as a hat - flatter than that. But there is a problem: Traffic is terrible with buses, trucks, cars, motorcycles, motorbikes, bicycles, and pedestrians are fighting for almost no space.  So pay attention.\n\nBeyond the city bikes, some of the hotels in town provide their guest with free bicycles. Bike shops also often rent bikes and some of them organize guided bike tours in the countryside.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nTaxis are available, but it may be best if you have your hotel or the restaurant you are eating at call ahead. Taxis should be called by phone and the nearest one available is sent to you through the company's radio system with its meter ticking away. In Florence, it can be difficult to hail a cab from the street curb. You either call for one or get one at the very few taxi stands. One popular taxi stand is at the central Santa Maria Novella Train Station and in a few major squares. The first taxi in the taxi stand line should be free - ask in case of doubt. Be aware that most taxis do not take credit card for payment. Be sure to have cash and ask in advance in case you only have a credit card with you. Please note that taxis in Florence are relatively expensive. Tipping is not expected, unless the driver helps you carry luggage etc.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nAnother way of getting around is by using the public buses from ATAF. A day ticket costs €5 and a 3 day ticket costs €12. A four-ride ticket costs €4.70. To get the best price you may have to go to the central bus station. You can buy tickets at tabacchi (shops selling tobacco, which are marked with official looking \"T\"s out front\"), kiosks\/newsagents\/bars where the symbol \"Biglietti ATAF\" is shown, as well as at the ATAF ticketing office at the bus station outside Santa Maria Novella train station. Remember to ask for a bus map. Several ticket options are available. One very convenient is the 4-rides ticket and the \"Carta Agile\". The former needs to be stamped when entering the bus (from the front and rear doors of buses - the central door is supposed to be exit only; though now it is more accepted to enter from the central door). The latter has an embedded electronic chip and needs to be held close (\"swiped\") to the upper part of the ticket machine inside the bus: the \"beep\" of the machine will inform you that a ticket has been paid and the display will show you how many more tickets (\"swipes\") you have left. Within 90 minutes of stamping\/swiping you can hop-off & hop-on on any bus of the urban ATAF network. Unfortunately and completely against Italian law, it is not uncommon to see bus drivers talking merrily on their mobile phone while driving. Don't expect riders to complain about it and don't panic - they will still drive with the same non-comfortable style as when they are \"only driving\". Hold tight to hand rails as Florence traffic is unpredictable and frequent sudden braking is necessary. Bus rides are not by all means \"smooth\". Buses are \"safe\" but pick pocketing is quite common. Please keep a close eye to your belongings and avoid showing off cash\/jewelry\/etc. especially in very crowded buses (especially for lines 17\/23\/14\/22 - generally speaking any crowded bus can give a chance to pick pocket).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By tram"]},"\n\nThere is one tram line operating in the city of Florence.  It connects Santa Maria Novella train station in central Florence with the southwestern suburb of Scandicci on a 7.4 kilometer route with a total of 14 stops.  The tickets used on ATAF buses can also be used on the tram.  Hours of operation:  daily 500AM-1230AM.  Frequency:  3–11 minutes depending on day and time of travel ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.gestramvia.it\/home.html"]},".  Duration:  about 23 minutes between Santa Maria Novella and Scandicci.  This tram began service on 14 February 2010 and is the first streetcar line in the city of Florence since 1958.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nDriving inside the historic center of Florence is virtually impossible.\n\nOnly residents with permits are allowed to drive there. Enforcement of the \"Limited Traffic Zone\" or \"ZTL\" is by camera. Violators will be tracked down and fined, but the fine may not arrive for a year or more after the infraction. The fines start at about €90. Once you enter the forbidden zone, it is virtually impossible to pass only one camera, and each time you do, it is a separate fine.\n\nIn addition, Florence has some of the tiniest streets in Europe, an amazingly fiendish one-way system that confuses even the locals, and some streets that just come to an abrupt end, with little or no warning.\n\nParking on the street in the historic center is out of the question. It may only be done by residents with a permit, and all other cars are towed away instantly - if not sooner - to some godforsaken suburb from which it will cost you hundreds of euros to get yours returned.\n\nThat said, you may be able to arrange a very temporary - about 30-minute - exemption through your hotel, which will need your license number and other information to make arrangements with the authorities. You will then have to get the car from the hotel out of the ZTL before the exemption expires.\n\nA car can be useful to reach some destinations just outside the city centre, like Fiesole or Settignano (these sights are also reachable by bus service), or for day trips to wonderful places such as Siena, Volterra, Arezzo, etc. It is possible, if a bit tricky to rent a car in Florence and get out of town and back to the car rental agency without violating the ZTL.

It has always price given per 100g, e.g. ",{"type":"''","value":["€3.5 etto"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["an etto"]}," is a \"hectogram\" or 100 grams-",{"type":"''","value":["ettogrammo"]},"). ",{"type":"''","value":["Crostini toscani"]}," are crostini with tuscan liver pâté.\n\nThere is also a uniquely Florentine fast food with a 1,000-year history - ",{"type":"''","value":["lampredotto"]},", a kind of tripe (cow stomach, or calf for preference, but a different part than the more familiar white \"honeycomb\" kind, dark brown in color; the name comes from its wrinkled appearance, which apparently reminds locals of a lamprey fish). The ",{"type":"''","value":["trippaio"]}," set their carts in the public squares in the center, dishing out the delicacy straight from the cauldron in which it is being boiled with herbs and tomatoes, chopping it and slapping the portions between halves of a Tuscan roll; the top is dipped in the broth. A mild green parsley- or basil-based sauce or a hot red one goes with it.\n\nThere are many ",{"type":"''","value":["gelato"]}," (Italian ice cream) stands; some connoisseurs consider the better Florentine gelato the finest in the world. Often ",{"type":"''","value":["gelato"]}," is made in the bar where you buy it. Because of this there are many exotic flavors of ice cream like watermelon, spumante or garlic. It's hard to find a gelato place open very late, so after dinner might not be an option. Near the Duomo though, there are a few places open after 10PM.\n\nTuscany is also the wellspring of ",{"type":"''","value":["cantuccini"]},", also called ",{"type":"''","value":["biscotti di Prato"]},". (Please note that in Italian, the singular of biscotti is ",{"type":"''","value":["un biscotto"]},"). It's traditional to enjoy them after a meal by dipping them in ",{"type":"''","value":["Vin Santo"]}," (\"Holy Wine\"), a concentrated wine made from late-harvested grapes, but you can also buy bags of them in stores throughout the city and eat them however you like.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Budget"]},"\nThere are numerous ",{"type":"''","value":["caffè"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["pasticcerie"]}," where you can find excellent sandwiches.\nPizza sold by weight is an equally excellent solution for budget dining (vegetarian and vegan options are almost always available), as is any ",{"type":"''","value":["caffè"]}," displaying a \"",{"type":"''","value":["Primi"]},"\" card in its window where you'll find pastas and other dishes at low reasonable prices. The delis (",{"type":"''","value":["rosticcerie"]},") are very affordable (and the food is often quite good), and some also have dining tables if you don't want to take away.\n\nYou can buy the makings for a picnic or snack at the Mercato Centrale. This large market has everything you might need, often at more affordable prices than supermarkets. The stalls will also sometimes vacuum seal whatever you buy so you can take it home with you.\n\nA general rule: the closer you are to the historic old town, the higher the price.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=L'Azdora"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.lazdora.it"],["email="],["address=Piazza del Mercato Centrale, 14R"],["lat=43.77687"],["long=11.2539"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Very tasty and cheap food."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Il Vegetariano"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.il-vegetariano.it\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+39 055 475030"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Via delle Ruote, 30 r.
