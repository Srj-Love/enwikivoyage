In other places in Indonesia, such as in  Maluku and Sulawesi, the divide is more rigid and has been the source of bloody sectarian clashes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nThere are many languages spoken on the island of Flores, all of them belonging to the Austronesian family. In the centre of the island in the districts of Ngada and Ende there is what is variously called the Central Flores Dialect Chain or the Central Flores Linkage. Within this area there are slight linguistic differences in almost every village. At least six separate languages are identifiable. These are from west to east: Ngadha, Nage, Keo, Ende, Lio and Palu'e, which is spoken on the island with the same name of the north coast of Flores. Locals would probably also add So'a and Bajawa to this list, which anthropologists have labeled dialects of Ngadha. \n\nPortuguese traders and missionaries came to Flores in the 16th century, mainly to Larantuka and Sikka. Their influence is still discernible in Sikka's language and culture.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By air "]},"\nThere are several airports in Flores, the main ones being at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Labuanbajo"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Maumere"]]},".

Creature comforts are few, with accommodations usually consisting of a thin reed mat on planks, and safety equipment is minimal to nonexistent.

The journey takes over 24 hours and has a buffet meal included in the price on Sumbawa. To Bima (Sumbawa), the bus is 'executive class', while the 2 hours from Bima to Sape are done in a crammed minibus. When bought separately and traveling by local transport, the journey will probably be cheaper, but it requires several interchanges and you should consider whether it's worth the extra time and hassle.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nBemos, small vans with seats facing each other, operate linking all the main towns. It is an incredible way to see the island and the driving ensures it is an exhilarating ride if you don't mind the heat, dust, and being squashed next to an old dear with a chicken. A distance that looks short on the map can still take hours in reality, so be patient and enjoy the ride.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Kelimutu_lakes_-_Aqua_and_Chocolate.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["350px"],["Aqua and Chocolate!"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThe most famous tourist attraction in Flores island itself is the crater lakes at Mount Kelimutu usually reach from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ende"]]},".

The Komodo National Park is held up as a role model for other parks throughout the world and the reefs and marine life are in nearly pristine condition.\n\nFlores also has a growing Eco-tourism industry, where you can visit traditional villages, stay with local families and join in Eco-friendly activities such as bird watching, trekking and participate in dances.
