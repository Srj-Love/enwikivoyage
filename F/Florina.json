(While in Greece, to avoid hostility, you may do best to refer to the non-Greek part of Macedonia as \"Skopje\" or just say the name of the town you have travelled from, as the use of the name \"Macedonia\" to describe a Slavic country is a sensitive subject for Greeks.)\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nThe weather in Florina is quite unstable during the whole season, especially during the winter. Florina is the city with the most snowfalls of all Greece that lasts from December to March.

There is no public transport.\n\nFrom ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bitola"]]}," it is about 30 km, and takes a little over an hour by taxi. Taxi drivers from the Republic of Macedonia require a special permit to operate in Greece, and they might use this fact to quote you a fare of up to €40. You should be able to knock them down to €25 or less. If they don't have a permit, they might offer to take you to the border for just a few euros, but you then have to walk between the border posts (800m) and hope to find a Greek taxi. Alternatively, they might take you all the way but pretend that they are a private car once in Greece.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nYou can easily get around by foot. It is a nice way to see beautiful neoclassical houses and explore the city of Florina.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nFirst of all, see the city of Florina.
