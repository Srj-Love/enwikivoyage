They are populated by a people descended from immigrants from the west country of England and Ireland. They have always sustained themselves from the resources of the sea and have developed a vibrant culture based on deeply rooted connections to place and community. Located in the Labrador Current, the Northeast Coast of Newfoundland is the only place in the world where people live in moving ice – as the Arctic pack ice and icebergs are brought to their shores by the south flowing current. To live here is to have an indomitable spirit, a deep understanding of the full community of life, of the give and take of living with the sea and no small sense of humour.\n\nPeople settled on Fogo Island and Change Islands, like most of Newfoundland, to fish for cod. Cod has sustained people in this place for centuries. In 1992, the government imposed a moratorium and the cod fishery was closed. The upheaval throughout rural Newfoundland was devastating with hundreds of small rural communities – outports – losing their livelihoods almost overnight.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Changeislands.JPG"],["thumb"],["Tickle of Change Islands"]]},"\nFogo Island and Change Islands have fared better than many other remote fishing communities that have not survived the 1992 moratorium on the cod fishery. Many of the fishermen of Fogo Island have adapted their fishery to other species such as crab and shrimp. \n\nIt is a sad reality that many fishing communities are ‘too far gone’ to save. This is not the case with Fogo Island and Change Islands. While the islands suffer from high unemployment, the out-migration of youth and the lack of many of the social and health facilities that most Canadians take for granted, there is no poverty of aspirations. Far from it.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Contemporary Art"]},"\n\nFogo Island and Change Islands are known for world-class, cultural programming that attracts people from around the world. The Fogo Island Arts Corporation hosts internationally recognized artists and researchers working in a wide range of disciplines, including visual art, new media, design, fine craft, music, writing and film. It also brings artists and local community members together for workshops, seminars, exhibitions and other events. Arts Corporation activities have two intertwined strands – an international Residency Program and a Production Program. All activities focus on locally rooted and site-responsive themes inspired by Fogo Island’s and Change Islands’ unique geography and people, while reaching out to the international art scene at the same time.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Architecture"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:St. Anne's Roman Catholic church.JPG"],["thumb"],["St. Anne's Roman Catholic church"]]},"\nThe basis for the Fogo Island Artist Residency Program is the six artist  studios designed by award-winning architect Todd Saunders. The studios are bold geometric structures that stand in contrast to the harsh, yet beautiful natural environment, while silently complementing it. The main concept behind the layout of each studio is to observe the surrounding environment during its transitions through the seasons. The studios are all oriented towards the sea and elevated above the ground to provide the resident artist with a feeling of being unobstructed and unbound. The materials and construction methods chosen reflect that of the local architecture of Fogo Island. The environment will leave its marks on the studios by weathering the structures over time. The structures are intended to touch the imagination and help maintain a connection between the past and the future.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe closest airport for visiting Fogo Island and Change Islands is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gander"]]}," International Airport.
