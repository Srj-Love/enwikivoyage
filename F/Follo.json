It is located between Oslo and Østfold and includes the southwestern part of the county's area east of Oslo. Nearly 116 000 inhabitants are dispersed in an area of about 819 km². The region consists of the municipalities Frogn, Oppegård, Ski, Vestby, Ås, Nesodden, and Enebakk.\n\nThe regional centre of Follo is Ski, which is also the largest town in the region. The municipalities of Nesodden, Oppegård, Ås, Frogn and Vestby have a coastline to the Oslo Fjord. Many of the settlements in Follo are situated along this coastline, like Nesoddtangen, Drøbak and Son, as well as several beaches that are well frequented in the summer. In the interior there are a lot of woods and farms. During the winter there are good opportunities of skiing in Østmarka and Sørmarka, and you can go skiing on artificial snow in Drøbak and at the golf courses near the farm of Østre Greverud.\n\nFollo is a region full of diversity. The landscape is beautiful and varied, offering plenty of recreational oppurtunities for both residents and visitors. An extensive road and public transport system minimises the distances between the coastal, agricultural and village areas. \n\nThe distances between places of special interest is also small. A wide range of activities and adventures is on offer throughout the year, and you are sure to discover something of interest to you. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Municippalities"]},"\nSki, Enebakk, Nesodden, Oppegård, Ås, Frogn and Vestby\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\nSki & Drøbak\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\nÅs, Kolbotn, Oscarsborg, Son, Hvitsten & Nesodden\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n'Follo' is thought to derive from 'Foldin', the old name for the wider reaches of the Oslo Fjord. Follo and Oslo have always had a close relationship with each other. Husvik near Drøbak was the natural market-place up until the twelfth century, when Oslo took its place. Drøbak later became the winter and transshipment harbour for Oslo. Hølen, Son, Hvitsten and Drøbak are all small coastal towns whose history as important trading ports is still very evident.\n\nThe many discoveries of prehistoric hill forts, burial mounds and rock carvings in the areas cultivated during the Stone and Bronze Ages indicate that the Follo region has always been an attractive place to live in. Norway's largest collection of Stone Age dwellings and implements was discovered next to the Bunnefjord. These finds led to the identification of the Nøstvet culture, one of the three prehistoric cultures in Norway.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe region is only 30 minutes from Moss Airport Rygge (RYG) and one hour from Oslo Airport Gardermoen (OSL).
