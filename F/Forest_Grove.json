Turn right on Scoggins Valley Road, and head west. You will pass the Lakestop Store and arrive at the Fee Both. After the fee booth, the road leads to West Shore Road which takes you around the entire lake.\n\nWest Shore Road takes around the entire lake, giving fisherman many access points all around the lake for bank fishing.  There is also a few designated fishing docks for people who don't want to search for a spot, although they fill up really fast.  For boaters, there are a few boat launches to get your boat out on the lake.  Half of the lake is a designated no-wake zone(under 5 mph) which is great for the trollers.  Boating out on Henry Hagg is very popular, because many of the good spots are not accessible from the bank (not to take anything away from the bank fishing, there are some awesome spots!).  Hot spots on the lake depend on the weather and temperature.  In the morning over by the dam seems to hit a lot.  When it gets to be later in the day and warmer, head to opposite of the dam where there are a lot of shady waters.\n\n- Season Entry Pass:  $50\n- Season Boat Pass:   $55\n- Senior Citizen Pass: $35\n- Daily Pass:         $5\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["buy"],["name=Bliss in the grove"],["alt=Bliss Hair Studio"],["url=http:\/\/www.blissinthegrove.com"],["email="],["address=2406 Pacific Avenue Forest Grove, Oregon"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Corner of Pacific Ave. and Elm"],["phone = +1 503-357-3300"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Forest Grove's leading hair salon and spa, their prices fit the size of this historic town, but the expertise and service far exceed it.
