The name refers to the tongue-in-cheek independence movement the area held in the 1970's following a series of setbacks which damaged the long-term economic development prospects of the region including the defeat of interstate and passenger rail projects and the moving of Carthage College from Carthage, IL to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kenosha"]]},", WI.  The region is also uniquely divided from the rest of the state as the majority lies between the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers and can only be reached by limited bridge access.  Though definitions may vary, the region traditionally includes the entirety of 14 counties including Adams, Brown, Calhoun, Fulton, Hancock, Henderson, Knox, McDonough, Morgan, Pike, Schuyler, Scott and Warren.  By and large, the entire area is rural but has some attractions worth seeing.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Galesburg (Illinois"],["Galesburg"]]},": The home of poet Carl Sandburg and the northern anchor city of the region."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Macomb (Illinois)"],["Macomb"]]},": The home of Western Illinois University.

It had been inhabited for thousands of years before American settlers traveling west settled here.  Though relatively obscure, it briefly became an important center of the state when members of the Church of Latter Day Saints purchased land in present day Nauvoo.  Nauvoo swelled to a population of almost 12,000 (comparable to Chicago at the time) but eventually tapered off after members of the Church left following Joseph Smith's death.  Afterward, the area remained relatively remote due to its position between the Mississippi and Illinois rivers.  Today, while access has vastly increased, this portion of the State is still considered to far flung from most other parts.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nForgottoia's relative remoteness means it's not easily reached by any single transportation method.
