It was formed by former residents of the Arraial of St. Anthony, in the valley of the Paraná river, who fled their village after a strong malaria epidemic hit the region. Afraid of the disease, drovers and traders who came from Bahia and Minas Gerais camped in the area where Formosa is located today.\n\nThe town was named in honor Arraial dos Couros after the travellers  who camped in leather tents that they brought to trade. The creation of the municipality of Formosa was on August 1, 1843.\n\nThe Cruls Commission trip came to the Central Plateau in 1892, from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Uberaba"]]}," heading into ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pirenópolis"]]},". A team toured Corumbá, Santa Luzia (Luziânia) and Mestre d'Armas (Planaltina), arriving in Formosa on September 14, 1892. A team led by Mr. Luiz Cruls followed another path, straight to Formosa, and arrived earlier on August 23. On Sept. 15, the whole party left Formosa toward Mestre d'Armas, following the same route left by Viscount of Porto Seguro. The result of this trip was the demarcation of the Cruls quad, within which the new capital was built and inaugurated in 21 April 1960.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The nearest airport is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brasilia"]]},"."]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Leaving Brasilia, take the direction of Sobradinho, and head straight through the BR-020.
