"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Traffic"]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["By car"]},"\nFormula One Grands Prix are popular events, so preparations should be made for heavy traffic. If arriving by car, Fridays are often the quitest day, but don't expect to just sail through. Traffic queues on the weekend can be ridiculously long, and unless you are a dedicated soul arriving before sunrise expect to be waiting upwards of half an hour. The same can be said for leaving. A vast majority of the crowd tends to try and leave at the same time, so unless you wish to leave early (and miss some racing) or wait until late in the evening (when there is no racing going on) be prepared for more waiting. The parking areas tend to be extremely large so make a note of anything that can make identifying where you've parked easier. No one wants to be searching for their car at the end of a tiring day.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["By shuttlebus"]},"\nSome circuits may offer a shuttlebus service, designed to alleviate traffic problems. Cars are parked some way from the track and shuttlebuses run at frequent times to the track in their own designated lane, so this can make entry a much quicker process.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["By helicopter"]},"\nArriving by helicopter is the most stylish way for the fan to enter, if you are lucky enough to be a VIP. Most tracks have some kind of heliport, if not a purpose-built one then a field within the circuit perimeter is used. All the worries associated with queueing and waiting are largely foregone, and helicopter is surely the most stress-free way of getting in. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nWalking is generally the best option (and sometimes the only option) for getting from one area to another. Circuit maps are printed within official programmes and on boards dotted around the track.

Bridges and service tunnels connect the interior of the circuit with the exterior. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nThere will be many stalls situated just outside the viewing areas selling all kinds of F1 and motorsport memorabilia. Stock typically includes official team\/driver merchandise and clothing; pictures and paintings; branded gear such as umbrellas, binoculars and flags; DVDs and other media; and collectible racing car models. Official programmes will also be on sale. Be prepared to pay high prices (remember you're mainly paying for the brand), but they can make excellent souvenirs from the event and the gear can be used again for future events. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nHotels near many of the circuits can sell out up to a year in advance, so if you are intending on staying nearby book early. Some venues, such as Silverstone, allow camping on fields adjacent to the circuit. You will probably need to book a camping ticket to take advantage of this, and these too usually sell out fast so book early if you want to take this option.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nDespite the high visibility of the 'motorsport is dangerous' notices Formula One has quite a good spectator safety record. However, no matter how safe a restricted part of the track may seem you should not venture onto these areas as they can be quite dangerous. Previous spectator fatalities at Formula One races have been caused by the spectators in question being on a restricted part of the track. Sticking to the proper areas drastically reduces the chances of being hurt in an accident. Be aware that moving vehicles operate in the paddock areas and along service roads, so keep your eyes and ears open.
