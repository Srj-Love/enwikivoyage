However, almost every street intersection is clearly labeled, though the existing signs differ for some roads from the names given by Google Maps.\n\nThe Fort Knox MWR Guidebook (available at several locations around post) has probably the best map of post available to the average visitor.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Patton Museum of National Cavalry and Armor"],["url=http:\/\/www.generalpatton.org"],["email=museum@knox.army.mil"],["address=4554 Fayette Avenue"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone =+1 502 624-3812"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=M-F 9AM-4:30PM; October-April: Sa-Su 10AM-4:30PM; May-September: Sa-Su 10AM-6PM; Open some holidays"],["price=Free"],["content=Self-guided tours of General Patton and weaponry from WWI-Present."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nFour gymnasiums (Otto, Smith, Natcher and Gammon), an Olympic-sized indoor swimming pool (Anderson) and several large athletic fields are available at various locations around post.
