It is the county seat for Broward county, and is part of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Miami"]]},"-Fort Lauderdale-",{"type":"[[","value":[["West Palm Beach"]]}," metropolitan area, which has over 5.5 million people.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Understand "]},"\n\nThe first inhabitants of the land were Seminole Indians who arrived in the 18th century. During the Second Seminole War, Major William Lauderdale led his Tennessee Volunteers into the area and raised New River Fort on the site of the modern city in 1838. In 1893, a young Ohioan named Frank Stranahan arrived and built a house that served as the first trading post, post office, bank and town hall of the area. The house was built near the site of the New River Fort and still stands today as a museum, Stranahan House.\n\nFort Lauderdale was officially incorporated as a town in 1911, and became the seat of newly formed Broward County.  It began as a predominantly agricultural community of dairy farms and citrus groves.\n\nMore growth came with establishment of the Naval Air Station, which is now Fort Lauderdale\/Hollywood International Airport.\n\nThe city and its surrounding suburbs experienced tremendous growth following the end of World War II, and the arrival of home air-conditioning.  In the 1960s, Fort Lauderdale became the center of Spring Break after the debut of the movie \"Where the Boys Are.\"  It is now an anchor of the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach Metropolitan area, the nation's 6th largest metro area.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Climate "]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Imperial"],["janhigh = 78"],["febhigh = 78"],["marhigh = 80"],["aprhigh = 83"],["mayhigh = 86"],["junhigh = 89"],["julhigh = 90"],["aughigh = 91"],["sephigh = 89"],["octhigh = 86"],["novhigh = 81"],["dechigh = 78"],["janlow = 59"],["feblow = 59"],["marlow = 61"],["aprlow = 65"],["maylow = 69"],["junlow = 72"],["jullow = 73"],["auglow = 74"],["seplow = 73"],["octlow = 70"],["novlow = 64"],["declow = 60"],["janprecip = 2.5"],["febprecip = 2"],["marprecip = 2.8"],["aprprecip = 4.2"],["mayprecip = 5.9"],["junprecip = 7.3"],["julprecip = 6"],["augprecip = 6.8"],["sepprecip = 8.8"],["octprecip = 9.2"],["novprecip = 3.5"],["decprecip = 2.7"],["description = ",{"type":"{{","value":[["ForecastNOAA"],["Fort Lauderdale"],["26.12385"],["-80.14355"]]}]]},"\n\nFort Lauderdale has a humid subtropical climate. Summers are very humid with temperatures in the upper 80s and low 90s lasting into early fall. \nThe city sees most of its rainfall in the summer (the wet season). Winter is warm and mild and mainly dry (the dry season) with mild temperatures that are occasionally broken up by some rain when cold fronts come through.\n\nMay to September is the summer wet season.  During the summer, it is warm and humid, with the prevailing wind bringing tropical breezes blowing up from the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and equatorial Atlantic. It is often clear and sunny in the mornings but as the land heats up the air rises and the sea breeze kicks in.  This brings in more damp moist air from the sea and so by noon it often starts to cloud over, and then there are commonly short showers in the afternoon, which helps to cool the air off for a cooler and generally dryer evening. The Atlantic hurricane season largely occurs from late July through early November, with peak activity generally occurring from mid-August through early October.\n\nFort Lauderdale, positioned just above the Tropic of Cancer, owes a lot of its winter warmth to the Gulf Stream that runs just a couple of miles off shore.  The Gulf Stream brings warm water up from the tropics year-round.\n\nOn a typical summer day the temperature does not get below 75 °F (24 °C).  Summer temperatures are commonly in the high 80s to low 90s (30-35 °C), which is often relieved by the sea breeze, which in turn brings some afternoon thunderstorms.\n\nDuring winter, humidity is significantly lower.  The average daily high in the winter is usually between 65 and 75 °F (18-24 °C) and the low normally around 59 °F (15 °C), rarely dipping below 40 °F (4 °C) when a front comes through.\n\nFort Lauderdale receives abundant rainfall, most of it falling in the summer. The annual total of 63.8 inches (1488 mm) is one of the highest for a U.S. city.  This sounds a lot, but it does not rain that much, it's just that when it does rain it really chucks it down, a real tropical downpour.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By plane "]},"\n\nSouth Florida has three airports with commercial service:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.broward.org\/airport Fort Lauderdale\/Hollywood International Airport"]}]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["FLL"]]},"), located just two miles south of down town Fort Lauderdale.

From Las Olas the RiverWalk connects to the Arts and Entertainment district. Parking at some beach hotels is limited and with things quite close you will find bicycles are a good way to get around.  Bicycle on the sidewalks if the traffic scares you.\n\nYou can go boating on the miles of waterways, take the water taxi, take a ride in a glass bottom boat or take one of the river cruises like the Jungle Queen.  There is also sport or deep sea fishing. If boating is not your thing, then you can just watch the boats go by from the many waterfront bars and restaurants.\n\nThere is plenty of shopping. The metropolis has lots of malls.  The closest to the beach is the Galleria, about 10 minutes walk from the beach along Sunrise Blvd.  The biggest by far is the huge Sawgrass Mills mega mall out on the west side of the city.  With over 300 retail outlets it is one of the largest malls in the USA.  There is  also the 'Swap Shop', that bills itself as 'the largest Drive-In movie theater and daily flea market in the world.'\n\nFrom Fort Lauderdale you can take a day trip to Miami's South Beach, or closer to home, Hollywood beach.  Popping down to visit the night clubs and restaurants along Hollywood Blvd near Young Circle is a close and interesting evening outing.\n\nOn Friday and Saturday evenings the bars and clubs along SW 2nd Street come alive with young people.  If you are under 35 this is the place to be on weekend nights. Known by locals as Colee Hammock, this is the two blocks on SW 2nd St just West of the rail way tracks, near the Science Museum and Preforming Arts Center.  For tourists, or people over 35, there is the RiverSide complex with bars and restaurants just East of the same railway lines.\n\nYou can take overnight excursions to the Florida Keys or the Bahamas, but both are just too far away to make good day trips.  \nThere are also organized coach trips to the theme parks in Orlando but again a bit too far for day trips.  If you are only here for a week it may not make any sense to take several days out to bus hundreds of miles to a different city when there is so much to do here.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Sports "]},"\n\nGolfing, snorkeling, scuba diving, and deep sea fishing are very popular sports in the area.

Due to its proximity to Miami, Fort Lauderdale is emerging as a location for Latin American headquarters for companies such as Microsoft.\n\nFort Lauderdale is a major manufacturing and maintenance center for large and expensive private yachts. The boating industry is responsible for over 100,000 jobs in the area.  With its many canals, and proximity to the Bahamas and Caribbean, it is also a popular place to keep a yacht, and a major stop for nautical staging and refitting. \nUnfortunately the boating industry is being squeezed out because waterfront property continues to increase in value and this is forcing some marinas and shipyards to sell out or relocate out of the area.  The total number of available boat slips is also declining as marinas are more actively seeking a few large mega-yachts instead of several smaller boats. \nEven so, the marine industry continues to grow, catering more and more to the mega yachts. There is now a section of the old State Road 84 that has been renamed Marina Mile where the mega yacht industry is booming.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the city's tourism was largely driven by younger people, because Fort Lauderdale was infamous for being THE spring break destination for college students. This changed in the late 1980s when there was a crack down on underage drinking. Fort Lauderdale is now less of a college spring break destination and does more year round business with European families and upscale US tourists.  The city also has a booming cruise ships industry: every day there are shiploads of tourists leaving and arriving at the sea port.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nFort Lauderdale has countless dining options.
