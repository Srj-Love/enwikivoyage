This cultural diversity is represented through the vast variety of international restaurants and small business, and in particular, there is a strong Korean presence that can be seen in retail and dining storefronts. \n\nFort Lee is a small town but is piled high with apartment buildings. Because Fort Lee is situated above the banks of the Hudson River, there are breathtaking views from almost any window facing the river. The New York City skyline and 4th of July fireworks are spectacular over the river. Although it is highly built up, Fort Lee also houses many playing fields and recreational parks as well as bike and running trails. And although there is a great deal of vehicle traffic to and from the George Washington Bridge, which connects Fort Lee with Manhattan, one of the largest perks of this town is the walking access to many restaurants, convenience stores and mass transit, in the form of buses and vans that frequently run across the bridge and up and down major streets.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:RiverRidge(highrise)FortLee 02.jpg"],["thumb"],["One of the more interesting of the many highrise residential buildings in Fort Lee"]]},"\nFort Lee is bordered by ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Edgewater"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Englewood Cliffs"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cliffside Park"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Leonia"]]},". \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nIf coming from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New York City"]]},", take the George Washington Bridge; Fort Lee is the first town on the New Jersey side of the bridge.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus or jitney"]},"\nAsk any bus or jitney driver leaving from the Port Authority George Washington Bus Station on 177 St. whether s\/he can let you off in Fort Lee.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By ferry"]},"\nFort Lee can also be accessed by boat or ferry from New York City via Edgewater and Weehawken docks. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nThe nearest airports to Fort Lee are ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Newark Liberty International Airport"],["Newark Airport"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New York City#LaGuardia Airport"],["LaGuardia Airport"]]},", Teterboro (general aviation only), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["John F.

Since so much of the town’s retail area is clustered in 3 or 4 block radius, it would be beneficial to walk around, but might also be dangerous given the high traffic intersections. If walking use caution, and if parking, make sure to feed the meter with plenty of pocket change; the meter maids take their job very seriously. Since fort lee is situated in such a convenient area for those commuting to and from the city, there is often high traffic and congestion on the roads.
