The 1880s business district was located on old Wire Street (now Broadway), which was a casualty of 4 devastating fires. Today, there are over 150 which are designated as landmarks. In the 1890s the Fort Meade Street Railway operated a horse-drawn service in the town.\n\nThe earliest known burial is John I. Hooker (1821â€“1862) located in the Evergreen Cemetery in town. Fort Meade's Christ Church (Episcopal) located at 526 N. Oak was built in 1889. It is a frame vernacular with Gothic Revival elements and was designed by architect J. H. Weddell. A minister by the name of C.E Butler had committed suicide at the church in 1894. Located next to Christ Church is the famous Rev. Wm James Reid House. Located within the historic district, the house was used for the HBO motion picture The Judgement featuring Blythe Danner, Keith Carradine and Jack Warden (1990).\n\nFuture Confederate General Stonewall Jackson was stationed at the fort in 1851. The town was burned by Union forces in 1864 and all of the original structures were destroyed, except the 2nd fort which was dismantled in the 1890s. Fort Meade has over 300 homes on the National Register of Historic Places and a handful that date to the late 1800s.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Forecast"],["Fort Meade"],["27.751628"],["-81.796767"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Visitor's Information"]},"\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Fort Meade Chamber of Commerce"]}," (",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.fortmeadechamber.com"]},"; +1 863 285-8253) is located at 214 W Broadway, Ste B.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nFort Meade is located at the junction of ",{"type":"'''","value":["U.S. 17"]}," (which runs north-south through town) and ",{"type":"'''","value":["U.S. 98"]},".
