The military fort was abandoned in 1842 then, re-established in 1850 and named in honor of a U.S. Army officer named Abraham C. Myers, a Colonel.   The fort was a center for command and control operations during war against the native Indian tribes that lived in Florida until they were defeated and, relocated out of the state to regions of western United States.   However, some of the Seminole Indian tribe never surrendered and remained in the Florida wilderness.  Colonel Myers reportedly resigned his commission and joined the Confederate army when the Civil War started.  Under Confederate control, African slaves were transported to the area from Virginia to support cultivation of crops.\n\nDuring the Civil War, the fort changed hands between forces of the North and South once or twice more.  An African-American Infantry of Union soldiers was stationed in Fort Myers during the period of 1863 to 1864.  Under the authority of Monroe County, the first school for African-Americans in the area was formed near Fort Myers, on the property an emancipated slave by the name of Nelson Tillis in 1885.  Although Thomas Edison operated telegraph services for the northern side of the Civil War, in 1886, Edison purchased a winter home in Fort Myers after marrying his second wife earlier that year (National Park Service, 2012).  In 1890, the first female African-American school teacher (Annie Moore), was hired to teach in the area (Lee County Black History Society, 2011).\n\nA county entitled Lee County, named so in honor of the southern commanding General, Robert E. Lee was established in 1887.  By about 1908, the population of Fort Myers was approximately five to six thousand (Captain F.A. Hendry Reunion Committee, 2002).  In 1912 the first local Black population only public school was established in Lee County (Williams Academy).  Henry Ford bought the home and land next door to Thomas Edison in 1916.  In 1920 the Jones-Walker Hospital was opened for the Black population only.  Bunche Beach was dedicated as the first local beach intended for the Black population only, in 1949. In 1954, the Supreme Court ruled to end segregation in public schools.  However, this decision was not implemented by integrating local Lee County schools until 1969.  The Williams Academy was relocated to Clemente Park located in the Dunbar section of Fort Myers in 1995 and, is the primary center for African-American history in Lee County.  The museum and administrative offices are established at 1936 Henderson Avenue (Lee County Black History Society, 2011). \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:FMBLKHISMUESUM2.JPG"],["thumb"],["Fort Myers Black History Society Museum entrance view."]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:FMBLKHISMUESUM1.JPG"],["thumb"],["Fort Myers Black History Society Museum, Clemente Park view."]]},"\nThe 2010 total census population of the city of Fort Myers was 62,298 (United States Census Bureau, 2010).
