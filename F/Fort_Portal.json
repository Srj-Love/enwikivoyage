Mubende is found about half way between Kampala and Fort Portal, here you can fill up on petrol and buy food and drink.\n\nThe Uganda Post runs the \"Postbus\", a daily bus to Fort Portal which departs from Kampala at 7:30 am, and costs 18 000 UGX (as of July 2012) per person. Another good connection is the \"Link\" bus that leaves from its station at the Old Taxi Park when ever a bus is full.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nFort Portal is a small town and it is easily possible to just walk. If you need to go further, there are Boda Boda motorbike taxis everywhere in town. For about 1000 UGX you can travel about 2 - 3 kilometers. But beware, they drive fast and are not very safe, and there are no good hospitals around in case you have an accident.\n\nYou can also take a \"private hire\" (taxi cab) which you can find on the corner of the main roundabout in the centre of Fort Portal and some other locations. There are also some bicycle taxis left.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nFort Portal on the edge of ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.lake-victoria.net Ugandaâ€™s equatorial rainforest"]},". is an enchanting land full of lakes, grasslands, marshes and forests on the lower slopes of the Rwenzori Mountains in western Uganda.\n\nThere are many wonderful lodges within Kibale forest where you can spend a night or two in a tree house experiencing the sounds of the forests inhabitants including 8 species of monkey, chimpanzees, the forst elephant, bush pig, giant forest hog and much more.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:fort.jpg"],["200px"],["right"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nVisit Queen Elizabeth National Park ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.lake-victoria.net\/QueenElizabeth.html"]}," which is less than an hours drive from Fort Portal on the way to Mbarara. The wide bio-diversity of habitats means that Queen Elizabeth National Park contains the most astonishing number of species - almost 100 types of mammal and 606 different birds! The Kasinga Channel alone is said to contain the world's largest concentration of hippos, but interestingly enough not many crocodiles! Other wildlife includes warthogs, buffalo, rare aquatic sitatunga antelope, giant forest hog, beautifully horned Uganda kob, topi, waterbuck, elephant and leopard.\n\nThis is a wonderful national park, sometimes dubbed 'the Pearl of Africa or Switzerland of Africa'. Quite simply this fertile equatorial area is especially scenic, with two lakes connected by a channel overlooked by a high peninsula. You will also find volcanic craters, grassy plains and tropical forest. As a result it has one of the highest biodiversity ratings in the world. Hunting exhibits such as stuffed lions, leopard skins, deer heads and elephants tusks may still be found adorning some hotels and lodges, but the emphasis is certainly more on shooting with a camera these days. Much of ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.safari-uganda.net Uganda Safaris"]}," were poached out in the past, especially elephants, but now the area is protected and elephants numbers are boosted by those entering the park from the Congo, where poaching is still a problem.\n\n\nThere is also a really funny statue of Sir Gerald Portal on the main road of the town. Yes, he does have a gun in his pocket and yes, he is pleased see you.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nFort Portal is famous for its tea. This area is gifted by nature with a cool climate which ensures a relatively slow plant growth rate.

These include anti-allergy, anti-oxidation, anti-hypertension, anti-viral, anti-obese, anti-cancer, anti-bacterial, enzyme inhibition and many other human health problems. You can buy the tea in any local shop or even better visit one of Fort Portal's tea plantations.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nThe two \"foreigner\" restaurants in town are the Gardens Restaurant just oposite the Shell petrol station on the main Lugard Road, and the Dutchess Restaurant (and hotel) on Mugurusi Road, right after the Uganda Human Rights Commission building. Both places have good pizza and other Western and local dishes, starting around 10,000 UGX (as of 11\/2013)\n\nThere are also many good local restaurants in Fort Portal, and they are much cheaper. But go early, as food preparation in Uganda takes time. Half an hour for some simple fast food is not uncommon.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nThe many varieties of tea, fresh fuit juices including pineapple, passion fruit and mango. And for the less health conscience Uganda have some excellent beers, Nile, Bell, and Pilsner to name just a few.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nThere is accommodation everywhere in Fort Portal town.
