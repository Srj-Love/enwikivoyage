There is nothing much for tourists to see, due to the restrictions put in place by the M.O.D. regarding access to the island. The island is mostly farmland and is bordered by a sea wall and extensive marshland. The island is roughly 15 miles from the coastal town of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southend"]]},".\n\nThere are two villages on Foulness. The largest one is Churchend and it is just like any other quiet village in Britain. It has a church, post office and general store. There was formerly a pub, 'The George and Dragon', but this closed in 2007 due to low usage and the landlords not keeping up with the rent. The church has also closed due to the costs of renovation of the church roof being too expensive.\n\nThe second village is Courtsend. It is a tiny village consisting of a farm and a few cottages.

Residents are issued with permits, which they must show to security guards when entering the restricted M.O.D. zone. Visitors need to contact the police lodge when visiting the island to obtain a temporary pass, or a visitor can contact a friend or relative who lives on the island, so they can in turn contact the lodge, avoiding the need for long security checks at Landwick.

On Saturdays there are four return service buses per day (one in the morning, one in mid-morning, one in the afternoon and one in the evening).

On the first Sunday of every month between April and October, the public from the mainland can visit the Heritage Centre between 12:00 noon and 4:00 pm. Visitors must stop at Landwick Police Lodge to sign in their car details and obtain a pass permitting access onto the island to visit the Heritage Centre. The Heritage Centre has displays on the history of the island, old school photos, photos of the last night of the second pub in Courtsend, and even the old plans and protest signs from the time when the government planned London's third airport near the island on Maplin Sands. The centre is run by volunteers who are friendly and always happy to answer questions about the history of the island.

M.O.D. staff will often warn you if a practice is going to take place. Please stay away from areas with warning signs as there could be objects that could explode and injure you.
