Come prepared. There are waterless self-contained toilets, but the site has no running water, no electricity, no telephones or cell phone coverage. \n\nThe Monument is something of a paradox. It is a small and limited attraction, surrounded by low lying, nondescript bluffs that aren't particularly photogenic. And yet \"Four Corners\" is a widely-applied label for all there are to do within a 200 to 500 mi (322 to 805 km) radius of where these four states intersect. When travelers speak of their \"Four Corners\" vacation, they may be headed for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mesa Verde National Park"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Monument Valley"]]},", the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Grand Canyon"]]}," and to other points further afield. But they may never set foot inside the Monument itself.\n\nThe Monument seems to evoke strong emotions in people, as well. Visitors are either vastly underwhelmed by this attraction, even angry they drove so far out of their way to see so little, or they are inordinately pleased with running from state to state and having their picture taken. The novelty of these intersecting boundaries makes Four Corners a popular destination, with long lines in the summer months at both the food stalls and the bright red viewing platform for the photo-op.\n\nThe Monument offers travelers a chance to learn more about Native Americans, their cultures and ways of life. There is a small visitor center, which is open year round (the park only closes on Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day). It features a Demonstration Center with Native American artisans. But the best way to learn about modern day Native Americans is to strike up a friendly and respectful conversation with the various Navajo vendors. Generally, the Navajo vendors are cheerful and open to questioning. (For more information on how to properly handle this, see the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Four_Corners#Respect"],["Respect"]]}," section in this article).\n\nThe average visit to the Monument lasts between 10 minutes and 2 hours, depending on whether or not people eat and thoroughly explore the Navajo stalls and visitor center.  \n\nSummer temperatures in the Monument can reach 110 ºF (43 ºC) and visitors should take extra precautions while visiting. To visit the park, you'll need to bring sunscreen, some kind of hand sanitizer, as well as something to drink. In the summer, blowing dust, flies and bugs are sometimes a problem. A word of caution: metal in the park during summer (including the aluminum bronze surveyor's mark) can be too hot to touch. Don't inadvertently burn yourself in your enthusiasm. The Navajo Nation is not responsible for any bodily injuries, accidents, thefts or losses that occur while on Navajo land. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Four Corners, NM, reconstructed monument in 2010.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["The Four Corners site"]]},"\n\nThe genesis of Four Corners as a novelty on a map dates back to 1846, when the U.S. Army invaded and defeated Mexico in the Mexican-American War. With the Treaty of ",{"type":"''","value":["Guadalupe y Hidalgo"]},", the U.S. gained control of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["California"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nevada"]]},", Utah, as well as portions of Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wyoming"]]},". \n\nTwenty-two years later, as Colorado prepared for statehood and admission into the Union, Four Corners was first surveyed by the U.S. Government Surveyors and Astronomers. This initial 1868 survey demarcated Colorado's southern boundary line. In 1878, New Mexico's west boundary and Utah's east boundary were surveyed and added. With the inclusion of the Arizona Territory boundary, the site became known as Four Corners. \n\nThe original survey monument, a sandstone marker, was erected in 1899, and was replaced with a small metal and cement marker in 1912. The northern boundary of the state of Arizona was surveyed in 1901. \n\nFour Corners was originally declared by Congress at a different latitude and longitude, but an early surveying error misplaced the location. The U.S. Supreme Court had to wade into the bureaucratic mess, ruling that the current location was so popular, it should be recognized as the boundary between the four states. \n\nFor most of the 20th century, the Monument was very simple, consisting of three steps up to a concrete pad, with a few posts and highway guard rails surrounding it. The Monument received a facelift in 1992 and now includes a flat slab of granite embedded with an aluminum bronze marker, as well as surrounding state flags and state seals. The Navajo and Ute nation flags are represented, as well. An inscription in the granite reads, \"Four states here meet in freedom under God.\" Just outside the monument, there are \"welcome and goodbye\" border signs for all four states. \n\nIn 1999, Congress appropriated money to Four Corners to improve the visitors center and build bathrooms with running water. Unfortunately, the project became entangled in various state and federal agencies, as well as squabbling between the tribal councils of the Ute and Navajo nations. It still remains unbuilt.\n\nIn May 2009, it was in correctly reported by the new media that a survey done by the National Geodetic Survey ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ngs.noaa.gov\/INFO\/fourcorners.shtml"]}," had discovered that the original survey done in 1878 was incorrect. The actual borders between Colorado and Utah were reported to be 2.5 miles to the west. Congress and the States involved agreed to change the original longitude and latitude to match the marker. (The 109th Western Meridian was originally set as the boundary between Colorado and Utah.) Thus rendering the original survey invalid.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nYou may run into the occasional Native American who speaks only Navajo, but this should not present an insurmountable language barrier.
