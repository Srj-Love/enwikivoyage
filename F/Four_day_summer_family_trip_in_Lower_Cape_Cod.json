It is a well-traveled tourist and vacation area, featuring miles and miles of beaches, natural attractions, historic sites, and much more. Cape Cod as a whole can be divided into four parts: the Upper Cape, the Lower Cape, Mid Cape, and the Outer Cape.

The Lower areas of Cape Cod that have been mapped out consist of four towns; Chatham, Harwich, Brewster, and Orleans.
