The territory which is today called France was made a part of the Roman Empire, and the Gauls (a name given to local Celts by the Romans), who lived there before the Roman invasions, became accultured \"Gallo-Romans\".\n\nWith the fall of the Western Roman empire in the 5th century AD, what was left were areas inhabited by the descendants of intermarriages between Gallo-Romans and \"barbaric\" Easterners (mainly the Franks, but also other tribes like the \"Burgondes\").\n\nThe legacy of the Roman presence is still visible, particularly in the southern part of the country where Roman circuses are still used for bullfights and rock and roll concerts. Some of France's main roads still follow the routes originally traced 2,000 years ago, and the urban organisation of many old town centres still transcript the ",{"type":"''","value":["cardo"]}," and the ",{"type":"''","value":["decumanus"]}," of the former Roman camp (especially ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Paris"]]},"). The other main legacy is the Catholic Church which can be arguably considered as the only remnants of the civilisation of that time period.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Middle-Ages"]},"\n\nClovis, who died in 511, is considered to be the first French king, although his realm did not extent much further than the area of the present Ile de France, around Paris. Charlemagne, who was crowned emperor of the new Western Roman Empire in 800, was the first strong ruler. Under his rule, he united territories which extend today to Belgium, Germany and Italy. His capital was Aix-la-Chapelle (now in Germany, known as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Aachen"]]},").\n\nDuring this period, France was under attack by the Vikings who came from the north and navigated the rivers upstream to plunder cities and abbeys and it was also under attack from the south by the Muslim Saracens who were established in Spain. The Vikings were given a part of the territory (today's Normandy) in 911 and quickly imposed the Feudal System of serfdom upon the native peasants. The Saracens were halted in 732 at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Poitiers"]]}," by Charles Martel, grandfather of Charlemagne and a rather rough warrior who was later celebrated as a national hero. \n\nStarting with Charlemagne, a new society was established, based on the system of feudalism. Although generally seen as an era of stagnation, it can be more aptly described as a period of economic and cultural developments (the music and poems of the Troubadours and Trouveres, the building of the Romanesque and later Gothic cathedrals) being followed by recession due to pandemic disease and wars.  \n\nIn 987, Hughes Capet was crowned as king of France; he is the root of the royal families who would later govern France. In 1154 much of the western part of France came under English rule with the wedding of Eleanor of Aquitaine to the English King Henry II (Count of Anjou, born in the town of Le Mans). Some kings of the Plantagenet dynasty are still buried in France, the most famous being Richard I 'the Lionheart', of Walter Scott fame, and  his father Henry II, who lies in the Abbaye de Fontevraud. The struggle between the English and French kings between 1337 and 1435 is known as the Hundred Years' War and its most famous figure is Joan of Arc (",{"type":"''","value":["Jeanne d'Arc"]},"), now considered a French  national heroine.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Infobox"],["Reading up"],["Before you leave you may want to read one or both of ",{"type":"''","value":["French or Foe"]}," by Polly Platt or ",{"type":"''","value":["Almost French"]}," by Sarah Turnbull — interesting, well written records from English-speaking persons who live in France.

Louis XIV, king from 1643 to 1715 (72 years), was probably the most powerful monarch of his day. French influence extended deep into the rest of Europe, even spreading as far as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russia"]]},"; its language was used in many European courts, becoming the international language of diplomacy, and its culture was exported all over the continent.\n\nThat era and the following century also saw the expansion of France's global influence. This colonial expansion sparked a whole series of wars with other colonial empires, mainly England (later Britain) and Spain over the control of the Americas.\n\nThe French Revolution started in 1789. The king, Louis XVI, and his wife, Marie Antoinette, were arrested and ultimately executed by guillotine, and the first French Republic was established in place of the 1000-year-old monarchy. Although this was a bloody period, it was and remains an inspiration for many other liberation struggles around the world.\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte reunited the country and restored the French monarchy by having himself crowned emperor in 1804, but his militaristic ambition which made him the ruler of most of western Europe was his downfall. In 1815 he was defeated at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Waterloo"]]}," (Belgium) by an alliance of British and Prussian forces. He is still revered in some Eastern European countries as his armies and government brought with them the ideas of French philosophers.\n\nFrance went back to monarchy until another revolution in 1848 allowed a nephew of Napoleon to be elected president and then become emperor under the name of Napoleon III. The end of the nineteenth century saw the industrialisation of the country and the development of the railways but also the start of the bitter wars with Prussia and later Germany.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["20th and 21st centuries"]},"\n\n1905 saw the separation of Church and State, under an initiative known as 'laïcité' ('secularism'). This was a traumatic process, especially in rural areas. Since then, French state has carefully avoided any religious recognition. Under a 'don't ask, don't tell' policy, the law forbids French students and civil servants from displaying any sign explicitly showing their religion. This policy applies to wearing Christian crosses, and has recently been applied to the Muslim hijab. In the early 21st century, statistics for Church-going and belief in God were among the lowest in Europe.\n\nThe First World War (1914 -18) was a traumatic period in France's history. Despite victory being achieved by France and her allies, almost 1.7 million French people were killed and many towns and villages and large tracts of countryside were destroyed. Much of the infamous trench warfare was fought across the eastern half of France. After the war, France took control of the formerly German areas of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alsace"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lorraine"]]},", as well as several of Germany's overseas colonies, and became a leading force in Europe for the next decade. \n\nThe Second World War (1939 - 45) saw France occupied for much of the war by Nazi Germany. With northern France under direct German control and the south ruled by a puppet government (known as the Vichy regime), many totalitarian measures were introduced, including the forced deportation of Jews to concentration camps. Despite the Vichy regime being officially collaborationist with the Nazis, many ordinary French citizens engaged in both active and passive resistance against the regime. In 1944, after Allied landings (including exiled French soldiers and those from France's imperial colonies) in Normandy and on the Mediterranean Coast, France was liberated from German control.   \n\nAfter the end of the Second World War, France went through a period of reconstruction and a new prosperity was achieved with the development of industry, and has since grown into Europe's second largest economy after Germany. France and Germany were among the first members of the Treaties which eventually evolved into the European Union. One of the most visible consequences of France's EU membership was the introduction  of the Euro (€) in 2002. It is now the common currency of sixteen European countries, which together make up the 'Eurozone'.\n\nToday, France is a republic with a President elected for a 5-year term. The incumbent President of the Republic is François Hollande. Current issues that face the country include the further integration of France into the EU and the adoption of common standards for the economy, defence and other fields.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Electricity "]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Electricity"]}," is supplied at 220 to 230V 50Hz.

Most of the motorway (",{"type":"''","value":["autoroute"]},") network is made up of toll roads. Some have a single toll station giving you access to a section, others have entrance and exit toll stations at every junction. Upon entering a tolled section of a road, you must collect an entry ticket from a machine which records the point on the road you started at and ensures you only pay for the distance you travel. Be careful not to lose your entrance ticket or you will be charged for the longest possible distance.  All toll stations accept major credit cards although they may not accept foreign credit cards. It is also possible to use the automatic booth, but only if your card is equipped with a special chip.\n\nRoads range from the narrow single-carriageway lanes found in the countryside to major highways. Most towns and cities were built before the general availability of the automobile and thus city centres tend to be unwieldy for cars. Keep this in mind when renting: large cars can be very unwieldy. It often makes sense to just park and then use public transportation.\n\nA French driver flashing headlights is asserting right of way and warning you of intentions and presence. Do not use it to mean thanks. Flashing headlights can also mean, \"Watch out as there's a police speed-check ahead of you!\"  Horns should be used only in legitimate emergencies; use of the horn in urban areas outside such circumstances might win you a traffic ticket.  Parisian drivers were notorious for honking their horns at anything and everything, though increased enforcement has greatly reduced this practice.\n\nDon't forget that in France they drive on the right!\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Renting a car"]},"\n\nOnce you arrive in France you may need to use car hire services. Most of the leading companies operate from French airports and it is advisable to book car hire in advance. It is a common experience at smaller French airports to not get the type of car you booked online but an alternative model. Sometimes the alternative model is quite different so check carefully before accepting the vehicle and stand your ground if it does not match your booking request and is not suitable to your needs.\n\nMost cars in France are equipped with standard transmissions, a fact that derives equally from the preferences of the driving public and the peculiarities of French licensing laws (automatic transmissions are generally only used by the elderly or those with physical disabilities).  This extends to vehicle categories that in other countries (read: the US) are virtually never equipped with a manual transmission, such as vans and large sedans.  Accordingly, virtually all of the vehicles available for rent at the average car hire will be equipped with a manual gearbox.  If you do not know how to drive a car with a manual transmission and don't have the time to learn before your trip, be certain to reserve your rental car well in advance and confirm your reservation.  Otherwise, you may find yourself in a car that is much larger than you can afford (or with no car at all).\n\nIt is a good tip when travelling in numbers to get one member of the party with hand luggage to go straight through to the car hire desk ahead of everybody else, this will avoid the crush once the main luggage is picked up from the conveyor.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By thumb"]},"\n\nFrance is a good country for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tips for hitchhiking"],["hitchhiking"]]},".  Be patient, prepare yourself for a long wait or walk and in the meantime enjoy the landscape. A ride will come along. People who stop are usually friendly and not dangerous. They will like you more if you speak a little French. They never expect any money for the ride. \n\nRemember that getting out of Paris by thumb is almost impossible. You can try your luck at the portes (city gates), but heavy traffic and limited areas for stopping will try your patience. It's a good idea to take the local train to a nearby suburb as your chance of being picked up will increase dramatically.\n\nOutside Paris, it's advisable to try your luck by roundabouts. As it's illegal to hitchhike on the motorways (autoroutes) and they are well observed by the police, you may try at a motorway junction. \n\nThe greatest chance is at toll plazas (",{"type":"''","value":["stations de péage"]},"), some of which require all cars to stop and are thus great places to catch a lift. If you've been waiting for a while with an indication of where to go, drop it and try with your thumb only. You can also try to get a ride to the next good spot in the wrong direction. Note with caution, however, that hitching from a péage, while a common practice, is illegal and French police or highway security, who are normally very tolerant of hitchhikers, may stop and force you to leave.  You can get free maps in the toll offices - these also indicate where you can find the \"all-stop-Péage\".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:SNCF TGV Duplex Viaduc de Cize - Bolozon.jpg"],["350px"],["thumbnail"],["A TGV crossing the Cize-Bolozon viaduct over the Ain river"]]},"\n\nTrains are a great way to get around in France. You can get from  pretty much anywhere to anywhere else by train.

There will be a track (\"Voie\") number next to the train and departure time. Follow signs to that track to board the train.  You will have a reserved seat on TGV trains. On other long-distance trains, you can optionally make reservations (at least one day in advance); if you do not have one you may use any unused seat not marked as reserved. To find your reserved seat, first look for the train coach number (\"Voit. No\"). Pay attention to the possible confusion between track number (Voi",{"type":"'''","value":["e"]},") and coach (voiture) number (abbreviated Voi",{"type":"'''","value":["t"]},")  As you go down the track, the coach number will be displayed on an LCD screen on the car, or maybe just written in the window or right next to the doors.\n\nThe reserved seat rules are lax; you are allowed if you switch seats or use another seat (of the same class of course) if it is empty because the TGV is not fully booked or the other person agrees to switch with you. The only requirement is not to continue using a reserved seat if the person holding the reservation claims it.\n\nOn the main lines, TGVs often run in twos. There are two possibilities: either the two TGVs are considered as one train with one train number (in this case each coach has a different number); or the two TGVs are considered as separate trains which run together during a part of their journey, with two different train numbers (in this case, the two trains may have two close numbers such as 1527 and 1537), and each train will have its own coach numbering. So be sure you are in the right train (the train number is shown on the LCD screen, with the coach number).\n\nIf you are early, there is often a map somewhere on the track that will show how the train and car numbers will line up on the track according to letters that appear either on the ground or on signs above. That way, you can stand by the letter corresponding with your coach number and wait to board the train closest to your coach. You can easily go from one coach to another, so if you are very late, jump in any coach of the same class before the train starts, wait until most people are seated, then walk to your coach and seat number.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Beware"]},": To avoid any form of fraud, your ticket ",{"type":"'''","value":["must"]}," be punched by an automatic machine (\"composteur\") ",{"type":"''","value":["before entering the platform area"]}," to be valid.

Stick to metric units (after all, the French invented this system!).\n\nThe French are generally attached to politeness (some might say excessively) and will react coolly to strangers who forget it. You might be surprised to see that you are greeted by other customers when you walk into a restaurant or shop. Return the courtesy and address your hellos\/goodbyes to everyone when you enter or leave small shops and cafes. It is, for the French, very impolite to start a conversation with a stranger (even a shopkeeper or client) without at least a polite word like \"bonjour\".

In such circumstances, it may be best to write down what you are trying to say. But tales of waiters refusing to serve tourists because their pronunciation doesn't meet French standards are highly exaggerated. A good-faith effort will usually be appreciated, but don't be offended if a waiter responds to your fractured French, or even fluent but accented, in English (If you are a fluent French speaker and the waiter speaks to you in English when you'd prefer to speak French, continue to respond in French and the waiter will usually switch back - this is a common occurrence in the more tourist-oriented areas, especially in Paris).\n\nPlease note that some parts of France (such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Paris"]]},") are at times overrun by tourists. The locals there may have some blasé feelings about helping foreign tourists who speak in an unintelligible language and ask for directions to the other side of the city for the umpteenth time.

Due to the historical rivalry between France and England, many people are also unwilling to reply in English even if they can understand it well. That being said, major hotels and tourist attractions will often have staff who speak English and other foreign languages.

French composers who are well-known among classical music circles, and even to many members of the general public, include the likes of Debussy, Bizet, Saint-Saëns, Massenet and Delibes. Even if you have never heard of these composers, chances are that you are already familiar with their compositions to a certain extent, as some of these pieces have found their way into popular culture, and are commonly heard in advertising and film scores.\n\nFrance is famous for its ballets, and most of the modern-day terms used by ballerinas originate from French. French composers have, unsurprisingly, contributed many famous ballet scores. To this day, the Paris Opera Ballet remains one of the most famous ballet companies in the world.\n\nSimilarly, French opera is also regarded as one of greatest operatic traditions in Europe. During the Baroque period, while  Italian opera which was taking much of Europe by storm, it never gained a strong foothold in France, where the French developed their own unique operatic tradition, partly thanks to the Italian Jean-Baptiste Lully (né Giovanni Battista Lulli), who was hired by Louis XIV for that purpose. The 19th century gave rise to some new French operatic styles such as the grand opera, which combined opera and ballet into a single performance. In fact, even foreign composers such as Rossini, Verdi and Meyerbeer are famous for their contributions to the French operatic stage. Another genre of opera that developed in 19th century France was the operetta, essentially a comedic opera with light-hearted music and subject matter, which was created by the German-born composer Jacques Offenbach. For those who are interested in watching French opera, the Paris Opera remains one of the premier opera companies in the world, though there are also good opera houses in some of the smaller cities.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Vacations"]},"\n\nMany of the French take their vacations in August. As a result, outside of tourist areas, many of the smaller shops (butcher shops, bakeries...) will be closed during parts of August. This also applies to many corporations as well as physicians. Obviously, in touristy areas, shops will tend to be open when the tourists come, especially July and August. In contrast, many attractions will be awfully crowded during those months, and during the Easter weekend.\n\nSome attractions, especially in rural areas, close or have reduced opening hours outside the tourist season.\n\nMountainous areas tend to have two tourist seasons: in the winter, for skiing, snowshoeing and other snow-related activities, and in the summer for sightseeing and hiking.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Money"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Euro"]]},"\n\nSome foreign currencies such as the US Dollar and the British Pound are occasionally accepted, especially in tourist areas and in higher-end places, but one should not count on it; furthermore, the cashier may charge an unfavourable exchange rate. In general, shops will refuse transactions in foreign currency.\n\nIt is compulsory, for the large majority of businesses, to post prices in windows. Hotels and restaurants must have their rates visible from outside (note, however, that many hotels propose lower prices than the posted ones if they feel they will have a hard time filling up their rooms; the posted price is only a maximum).\n\nAlmost all stores, restaurants and hotels take the CB French debit card, and its foreign affiliations, Visa and MasterCard. American Express tends to be accepted only in high-end shops. Check with your bank for applicable fees (typically, banks apply the wholesale inter-bank exchange rate, which is the best available, but may slap a proportional and\/or a fixed fee).\n\nFrench CB cards (and CB\/Visa and CB\/MasterCard cards) have a \"smart chip\" on them allowing PIN authentication of transactions. This system, initiated in France, has now evolved to an international standard and newer British cards are compatible. Some automatic retail machines (such as those vending tickets) may be compatible only with cards with the microchip. In addition, cashiers unaccustomed to foreign cards possibly do not know that foreign Visa or MasterCard cards have to be swiped and a signature obtained, while French customers systematically use PIN and don't sign the transactions.\n\nThere is (practically) no way to get a cash advance from a credit card without a PIN in France.\n\nAutomatic teller machines (ATM) are by far the best way to get money in France. They all take CB, Visa, MasterCard, Cirrus and Plus and are plentiful throughout France. They may accept other kinds of card; check for the logos on the ATM and on your card (on the back, generally) if at least one matches. It is possible that some machines do not handle 6-digit PIN codes (only 4-digit ones), or that they do not offer the choice between different accounts (defaulting on the checking account). Check with your bank about applicable fees, which may vary greatly (typically, banks apply the wholesale inter-bank exchange rate, which is the best available, but may slap a proportional and\/or a fixed fee; because of the fixed fee it is generally better to withdraw money in big chunks rather than €20 at a time). Also, check about applicable maximal withdrawal limits.\n\nTraveller's cheques are difficult to use — most merchants will not accept them, and exchanging them may involve finding a bank that accepts to exchange them and possibly paying a fee.\n\nNote that the postal service doubles as a bank, so often post offices will have an ATM. As a result, even minor towns will have ATMs usable with foreign cards.\n\nExchange offices (",{"type":"''","value":["bureaux de change"]},") are now rarer with the advent of the Euro - they will in general only be found in towns with a significant foreign tourist presence, such as Paris. Some banks exchange money, often with high fees. The Bank of France no longer does foreign exchange.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Do"]}," Put money into your checking account, carry an ATM card with a Cirrus or Plus logo on it and a 4-digit pin that does not start with '0' and withdraw cash from ATMs. Pay larger transactions (hotel, restaurants...) with Visa or MasterCard.

Residential areas will often have small supermarkets (such as ",{"type":"''","value":["Carrefour Market"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["Intermarché"]},"). Large supermarkets (",{"type":"''","value":["hypermarchés"]}," such as ",{"type":"''","value":["Géant Casino"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["Carrefour"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["Auchan"]},") are mostly located on the outskirts of towns and are probably not useful unless you have access to a car.\n\nPrices are indicated with all taxes (namely, the TVA, or value-added tax) included. It is possible for non-EU residents to get a partial refund upon departure from certain stores that have a \"tax-free shopping\" sticker; inquire within. TVA is 19.6% on most things, but 7% on some things such as books, restaurant meals, and public transport and 5.5% on food purchased from grocery stores (except for sweets!). Alcoholic beverages are always taxed at 19.6%, regardless of where they're purchased.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nWith its international reputation for fine dining, few people would be surprised to hear that French cuisine can certainly be very good. As a testament to this, France is tied with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Japan"]]}," for first place as the country with the most Michelin star restaurants. Unfortunately, it can also be quite disappointing; many restaurants serve very ordinary fare, and some in touristy areas are rip-offs. Finding the right restaurant is therefore very important - try asking locals, hotel staff or even browsing restaurant guides for recommendations as simply walking in off the street can be a hit and miss affair.  \n\nThere are many places to try French food in France, from three-star Michelin restaurants to French \"brasseries\" or \"bistros\" that you can find at almost every corner, especially in big cities. These usually offer a relatively consistent and virtually standardised menu of relatively inexpensive cuisine. To obtain a greater variety of dishes, a larger outlay of money is often necessary. In general, one should try to eat where the locals do for the best chance of a memorable meal. Most small cities or even villages have local restaurants which are sometimes listed in the most reliable guides. In fact, many fine dining restaurants are located in rural villages rather than in the big cities, and French people often drive to those villages to dine during special occasions. There are also specific local restaurants, like \"bouchons lyonnais\" in Lyons, \"crêperies\" in Brittany (or in the Montparnasse area of Paris), etc.\n\nChinese, Vietnamese, even Thai eateries are readily available in Paris, either as regular restaurants or \"traiteurs\" (fast-food). They are not so common, and are more expensive, in smaller French cities. Many places have \"Italian\" restaurants though these are often little more than unimaginative pizza and pasta parlors. You will also find North African (Moroccan, Algerian, Tunisian) as well as Greek and Lebanese food. The ubiquitous hamburger eateries (US original or their French copies) are also available; note that McDonalds is more upmarket in France than in the US.\n\nIn France, taxes (7 per cent of the total in restaurants) and service (usually 15 per cent) are always included in the bill, so anything patrons add to the bill amount is an \"extra-tip\". French people usually leave one or two coins if they were happy with the service.  \n\nFixed price menus seldom include beverages. If you want water, waiters will often try to sell you mineral water (Évian, Thonon) or fizzy water (Badoit, Perrier), at a premium; ask for a ",{"type":"''","value":["carafe d'eau"]}," for tap water, which is free and safe to drink. Water ",{"type":"''","value":["never"]}," comes with ice in it unless so requested (and water with ice may not be available).\n\nAs in other countries, restaurants tend to make a large profit off beverages. Expect wine to cost much more than it would in a supermarket.\n\nOrdering is made either from fixed price menus (",{"type":"''","value":["menu fixe"]},") or ",{"type":"''","value":["à la carte"]},".\n\nA typical fixed price menu will comprise:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" appetiser, called ",{"type":"''","value":["entrées"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["hors d'œuvres"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" main dish, called a ",{"type":"''","value":["plat"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" dessert (",{"type":"''","value":["dessert"]},") or cheese (",{"type":"''","value":["fromage"]},")"]},"\nSometimes, restaurants offer the option to take only two of the three courses, at a reduced price.\n\nCoffee is always served as a final step (though it may be followed by liquors). Coffee will always be served black unless requested otherwise (for white coffee, ask for \"",{"type":"''","value":["café au lait"]},"\"). A request for coffee during the meal will be considered strange. \n\nNot all restaurants are open for both lunch and dinner, nor are they always open all year around. It is therefore advisable to carefully check the opening times and days. A restaurant open for lunch will usually start service at noon and accept patrons until 13:30. Dinner begins at around 19:30 and patrons are accepted until 21:30. Restaurants with longer service hours are usually found only in the larger cities and in town centres. Finding a restaurant open on Saturday and especially Sunday can be a challenge unless you stay close to the tourist areas. \n\nIn a reasonable number of restaurants, especially outside tourist areas, a booking is compulsory and people may be turned away without one, even if the restaurant is clearly not filled to capacity.  For this reason, it can be worthwhile to research potential eateries in advance and make the necessary reservations to avoid disappointment, especially if the restaurant you're considering is specially advised in guide books.\n\nA lunch or dinner for two on the \"menu\" including wine and coffee will cost you (as of 2004) €70 to €100 in a listed restaurant in Paris. The same with beer in a local \"bistro\" or a \"crêperie\" around €50. A lunch or dinner for one person in a decent Chinese restaurant in Paris can cost as little as €8 if one looks carefully.\n\nOutside of Paris and the main cities, prices are not always lower but the menu will often include a fourth course, usually cheese. As with everywhere beware of the tourist traps which are numerous around the heavy travelled spots and may offer a nice view but not much to remember on your plate. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Bread"]},"\n\nBakeries (",{"type":"''","value":["boulangeries"]},") are something of a French institution and are to be found all over the country from the smallest villages to city streets.

Nicolas offers good advice on what to buy (specify the kind of wine and the price range you desire). In general, only French wines are available unless a foreign wine is a \"speciality\" with no equivalent in France (such as port), and they are classified by region of origin, not by grape.\n\nEtiquette-wise, you shouldn't drink alcoholic beverages (especially red wine or strong alcohol such as cognac) directly from a 70 cl bottle.

Really, you're not paying so much for the beverage as for the table spot.

Bear this in mind when comparing prices with hotels, where breakfast is NOT included in the room price.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Gîtes"]}," or ",{"type":"'''","value":["gîtes ruraux"]}," are holiday cottages, and generally rented out as a complete accommodation unit including a kitchen, mostly on a weekly basis. Literally the French word gîte just means a place to spend the night; however it now largely used to describe rental cottages or self-catering holiday homes, usually in rural parts of France. There are very few near or in the cities. Finding them requires buying a guide or, for greater choice, using the internet, as you will not find many signposted on the road.\n\nTraditionally, gîtes provided basic good value accommodation, typically adjacent to the owner's household or in a nearby outbuilding. More recently the term has been extended, and can now be used to describe most country-based self-catering accommodation in France. Hence it includes accommodation as varied as small cottages to villas with private swimming pools.\n\nDuring peak summer months the best self-catering gîtes require booking several months in advance.\n\nThere are thousands of B&Bs and gîtes in France rented out by foreign owners, particularly British and Dutch, and these tend to be listed, sometimes exclusively, with English-language or international organisations and websites that can be found by keying the words \"chambres d'hôtes\", \"gîtes\" or \"gîtes de france\" into any of the major search engines. \n\nThere is a large number of organisations and websites offering gîtes. \n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Gîtes de France "]},"\n\nA France-wide cooperative organisation, ",{"type":"'''","value":["Gîtes de France"]}," groups  more than 50,000 rural places of accommodation together and was the first in France to offer a consistent rating system with comprehensive descriptions. \n\nDespite the name, Gîtes de France offers B&B as well as holiday rental (gîte) accommodation.  \n\nThe Gîtes de France rating system uses wheat stalks called ",{"type":"''","value":["épis"]}," (equivalent to a star rating), based on amenities rather than quality - though generally the two go together. \n\nThrough its website, bookings can be done directly with owners or through the local Gîtes de France booking agency (no extra fee for the traveller). Although an English language version is available for many of the website pages, for some departments the pages giving details of an individual gîte are only in French. \n\nThere is no particular advantage in using Gîtes de France rather than one of the other online gîtes sites, or booking directly with a gîte owner. The procedure is pretty standard for all gîte booking sites, whether French or foreign - with the advantage that the whole booking process can be done in English, which is not always the case with Gîtes de France.\n\nAfter making a gîte booking you will receive, by post, a contract to sign (for gîtes only). Sign and return one copy. When signing write the words \"Read and approved\", and the name of your home town, before signing and dating the contract. You will normally be asked to pay a deposit of a quarter to a third of the booking fee. The rest will be required one month before the start of your holiday. When you arrive at the gîte a security deposit, specified in the contact, should be given to the owner in cash. This will be returned at the end of your stay, minus any fuel charges and breakages.\n\nAnother great resource for booking gîtes and villas in France is Holiday France Direct",{"type":"[","value":["www.holidayfrancedirect.co.uk"]},", It enables you to deal directly with the property owners and offers customers discounted ferry travel with Brittany Ferries.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Gîtes d'étape "]},"\nAnother possibility is ",{"type":"''","value":["gîtes d'étape"]},". These are more like overnight stays for hikers, like a mountain hut. They are mostly cheaper than the ",{"type":"''","value":["Gîtes de France"]}," but also much more basic.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Short term rentals"]},"\n\nTravellers should definitely consider short-term villa\/apartment\/studio rentals as an alternative to other accommodation options.  Short term can be as few as several days up to months at a stretch.  Summer rentals are usually from Saturday to Saturday only (July & August). This type accommodation belongs to a private party, and can range from basic to luxurious.  A particular advantage, aside from competitive prices, is that the accommodations come with fully fitted kitchens. \n\nHundreds of agencies offer accommodation for short term rentals on behalf of the owner, and can guide you into finding the best property, at the best price in the most suitable location for you. An internet search for the location and type of property you're looking for will usually return the names of several listing sites, each of which may have hundreds or thousands of properties for you to choose from. There are plenty of sites in both English and French, and the rental properties may be owned by people of any nationality.\n\nWell established holiday rental sites include ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.holidaylettings.co.uk\/ Holidaylettings.co.uk"]}]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ownersdirect.co.uk\/ Owners Direct"]}]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.alphaholidaylettings.com Alpha Holiday Lettings"]}]},".

Most camp sites are a little way out of town and virtually all cater not just for tents but also for camper vans and caravans. While all camp sites have the basic facilities of shower and toilet blocks, larger sites tend to offer a range of additional facilities such as bars and restaurants, self-service launderettes, swimming pools or bicycle hire. All camp sites except for very small 'farm camping' establishments must be registered with the authorities, and are officially graded  using a system of stars. \n\nIn coastal areas, three-star and four-star camp grounds must generally be booked in advance during the months of July and August, and many people book from one year to the next. In rural areas, outside of popular tourist spots, it is usually possible to show up unannounced, and find a place; this is particularly true with the municipal camp sites that can be found in most small towns; though even then it may be advisable to ring up or email in advance to make sure. There are always exceptions.\n\nIn France it's forbidden to camp:\n",{"type":"*","value":["in woods, natural, regional and national parks"]},{"type":"*","value":["on public roads and streets"]},{"type":"*","value":["on beaches"]},{"type":"*","value":["less than 200 metres from watering place used for human consumption"]},{"type":"*","value":["on natural protected sites"]},{"type":"*","value":["less than 500 metres from a protected monument"]},{"type":"*","value":["everywhere where it's forbidden by local laws"]},{"type":"*","value":["on private properties without the owner's consent."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Learn"]},"\n\nFrance, of course, is the best place to acquire, maintain and develop your French. A number of institutions offer a variety of courses for travellers.\n\nHaving been a major world power for much of its history, France is home to many well-regarded universities. The downside for English-only speakers is that degree programmes are generally conducted in French, though some universities may offer the option for postgraduate research students to complete their thesis in English. English is considered to be the international language in academic fields, so many French researchers publish their findings in English. The most prestigious university in France is arguably the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ens.fr École normale supérieure de Paris"]}]},", which counts many high profile French public figures among its graduates.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Work"]},"\n\nIf you are by law required to obtain a visa or other type of authorisation to work and fail to do so, you risk possible arrest, prosecution, expulsion and prohibition from re-entering France and the Schengen area.\n\nCitizens of EU and EEA countries (save from some Eastern European countries, for a temporary period) and Switzerland can work in France without having to secure a work permit. Most non-EU citizens will need a work permit - however, some non-EU citizens (such as Canadians, Croatians, New Zealanders etc.) do ",{"type":"'''","value":["not"]}," require a visa or work permit to work during their 90 day visa-free period of stay in France (see the 'Get in' section above for more information).\n\nIf you are an EU citizen or from an EEA country and  want to earn money to continue travelling, Interim agencies (e.g. Adecco, Manpower) are a good source of temporary jobs. You can also consider working in bars, restaurants, and\/or nightclubs (they are often looking for English-speaking workers, particularly those restaurants in tourist areas - fast-food restaurants such as McDonald's and Quick are also always looking for people).\n\nA lot of 'student jobs', if you happen to be in a big city, are also available for younger travellers, and foreigners are often very welcome. Such example jobs include ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Teaching English"],["giving private English lessons"]]},", taking care of young children (i.e. ",{"type":"'''","value":["au pairing"]},") among other things...check out the  buildings of various universities as they often have a lot of advertisements. An easy way to find jobs in France is to use dedicated search engines offered by various employment websites.\n\nDon't forget that being an English speaker is a big advantage when you're looking for a job - French employers really have a problem finding English-speaking workers. Do note, however, that it will be much easier for you if you know a bit of French, for the same reason (your colleagues are not likely to speak English). However, don't overestimate your chances of finding work; unemployment has increased in recent years due to the worldwide financial crisis and there are often more people applying for jobs than there are vacancies.\n\nThe French labour market tends to operate through personal contacts - if you know someone that works somewhere, you can probably figure out quite an easy way to work at that place too. It always helps to know people living in the area you wish to work.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Crimes"]},"\nCrime-related emergencies can be reported to the toll-free number 17 or 112 (European emergency telephone number). Law enforcement agencies are the National Police (",{"type":"''","value":["Police nationale"]},") in urban areas and the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Gendarmerie nationale"]}," in the countryside, though for minor crimes such as parking and traffic offences some towns and villages also have a municipal police force (",{"type":"'''","value":["Police municipale"]},").\n\nFrance generally has low crime rates and is one of the safest countries in the world, but large cities are plagued with the usual woes. Violent crime against visitors is very rare, but there is pickpocketing and purse-snatching in tourist hot-spots. If the usual precautions against this are taken, your valuables and you will be safe.\n\nThe inner city areas and a few select suburbs are usually safe at all hours. In large cities, especially Paris, there are a few areas which are better to avoid. Parts of the suburbs are hives of youth gang-related activities and drug dealing; however these are almost always far from tourist areas and you should have no reason to visit them. Common sense applies: it is very easy to spot derelict areas.\n\nThe subject of crime in the poorer suburbs is very touchy as it may easily have racist overtones, since many people associate it with working-class youth of North African origin. You should probably not express any opinion on the issue, unless you feel comfortable with the person with whom you're talking.\n\nWhile it is not compulsory for French citizens to carry identification, they usually do so. Foreigners should carry some kind of official identity document. Although random checks are not the norm, you may be asked for ID in some kinds of situations, for example if you cannot show a valid ticket when using public transportation; not having one in such cases will result in you being taken to a police station for further checks. Even if you feel that law enforcement officers have no right to check your identity (they can do so only in certain circumstances), it is a bad idea to enter a legal discussion with them; it is better to put up with it and show your ID. Again, the subject is sensitive as the police have often been accused of targeting people according to criteria of ethnicity (e.g. ",{"type":"''","value":["délit de sale gueule"]}," = literally \"crime of a dirty face\" but perhaps equivalent to the American \"driving while black.\")\n\nDue to the international threat of terrorism, police with the help of military units, often patrol monuments, the Paris Metro, train stations and airports. Depending on the status of the \"Vigipirate\" plan (anti terrorist units) it is not uncommon to see armed patrols in those areas. The presence of police should be of help to tourists, as it also deters pickpockets and the like. However, suspicious behaviour, public disturbances etc., may attract police officers' attention for the wrong reasons.\n\nIn France, failing to offer assistance to 'a person in danger' is a criminal offence in itself. This means that if you fail to stop upon witnessing a motor accident, fail to report such an accident to emergency services, or ignore appeals for help or urgent assistance, you may be charged. Penalties include suspended prison sentence and fines. The law does not apply in situations where answering an appeal for help might endanger your life or the lives of others.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Controlled substances"]},"\nCarrying or using narcotic substances, from marijuana to hard drugs, is illegal whatever the quantity. The penalty can be severe especially if you are suspected of dealing. Trains and cars coming from countries which have a more lenient attitude (such as the Netherlands) are especially targeted. Police have often been known to stop entire coaches and search every passenger and their bags thoroughly.\n\nFrance has a liberal policy with respect to alcohol; there are usually no ID checks for purchasing alcohol (unless you look much younger than 18). However, causing problems due to public drunkenness is a misdemeanor and may result in a night spent in the cells of a police station. Drink driving is a severe offence and may result in heavy fines and jail sentences.\n\nA little etiquette note: while it is common to drink beer straight from the bottle at informal meetings, doing the same with wine is normally only done by tramps (",{"type":"''","value":["clochards"]},").\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Tap water "]},"\nTap water (",{"type":"''","value":["eau du robinet"]},") is drinkable, except in rare cases such as in rural rest areas and sinks in railway carriage toilets, in which case it will be clearly signposted as ",{"type":"''","value":["eau non potable"]},". ",{"type":"''","value":["Eau potable"]}," is drinkable water (you may, however, not like the taste and prefer bottled water).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Medical help"]},"\nHealth care in France is of a very high standard.\n\nPharmacies are denoted by a green cross, usually in flashing neon. They sell medicine, contraceptives, and often beauty and related products (though these can be very expensive). Medicines must be ordered from the counter, even non-prescription medicines. The pharmacist is able to help you about various medicines and propose you generic drugs.\n\nSince drug brand names vary across countries even though the effective ingredients stay the same, it is better to carry prescriptions using the international nomenclature in addition to the commercial brand name. Prescription drugs, including oral contraceptives (aka \"the pill\"), will only be delivered if a doctor's prescription is shown.\n\nIn addition, supermarkets sell condoms (",{"type":"''","value":["préservatifs"]},") and also often personal lubricant, bandages, disinfectant and other minor medical items.  Condom machines are often found in bar toilets, etc.\n\nMedical treatment can be obtained from self-employed physicians, clinics and hospitals. Most general practitioners, specialists (e.g. gynaecologists), and dentists are self-employed; look for signs saying ",{"type":"''","value":["Docteur"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["médecin généraliste"]}," means general practitioner). The normal price for a consultation with a general practitioner is €23, though some physicians charge more (this is the full price and not a co-payment). Physicians may also do home calls, but these are more expensive.\n\nResidents of the European Union are covered by the French social security system, which will reimburse or directly pay for 70% of health expenses (30% co-payment) in general, though many physicians and surgeons apply surcharges. Other travellers are ",{"type":"''","value":["not"]}," covered and will be billed the full price, even when at a public hospital; non-EU travellers should have travel insurance covering medical costs.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Emergencies"]},"\nHospitals will have an emergency room signposted ",{"type":"''","value":["Urgences"]},".\n\nThe following numbers are toll-free:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["15"]}," Medical emergencies"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["17"]}," Law enforcement emergencies (for e.g. reporting a crime)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["18"]}," Firefighters"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["112"]}," European standard emergency number."]},"Operators at these numbers can transfer requests to other services if needed (e.g. some medical emergencies may be answered by firefighter groups).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Smoking"]},"\nSmoking is prohibited by law in all enclosed spaces accessible to the public (this includes train and metro cars, and station enclosures, workplaces, restaurants and cafés) unless in areas specifically designated for smoking, and there are few of these. There was an exception for restaurants and cafés, but since the 1st January 2008, the smoking ban is also enforced in those locations. You may face a fine of €68 if you are found smoking in these places.\n \nAs well as police officers, metro and train conductors can and do enforce the anti-smoking law and will fine you for smoking in non-designated places; if you encounter problems with a smoker in train, you may go find the conductor.\n\nAs hotels are not considered public places, some offer smoking and non-smoking rooms.\n\nOnly people over the age of 18 may purchase tobacco products. Shopkeepers may request a photo ID. A pack of 20 cigarettes costs around €6.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Respect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["At the restaurant"]},"\nAt French restaurants, as in other parts of Europe, it is considered impolite to have one's elbows on the table, but it is also considered impolite to leave food on your plate or lay one's hand in the lap while eating. When consuming beverages such as Coca-Cola, it is seen as almost outlandish to drink directly from the bottle. In fact, even some of the museum cafeterias provide a plastic cup for you to drink from. If you are given a glass or a cup with your beverage, use it.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["On the Métro"]},"\nThe Métro subway system is a great way to get around Paris (or Lyon, Marseille, et al.), a fact which is readily apparent by the throngs of people that use it to get to work, school, and the like.  If you do not ride the train at home, or if you come from a place that doesn't have a subway system, there are certain points of etiquette that you may not be aware of.  When boarding at the station, let those exiting the train step off onto the platform before boarding, and once aboard move to the centre of the car.  If you have luggage, move it as far out of the path of others as possible (on the RER B to Charles de Gaulle airport, use the luggage racks above the seats instead). Certain stations have moving walkways to cover the distances between platforms - ",{"type":"'''","value":["walk on the left and stand on the right!"]},"  Finally, do note that the doors on French subway cars don't generally open automatically once the train has stopped at the station; rather, most cars have a small button or lever on the doors that opens them.  If you should happen to be standing near the door in a crowded car you might hear someone behind you say \"la porte, s'il vous plait,\" which means that person would like to get off the train and is asking you to open the door for him\/her.  Pop the door open and step aside (or down onto the platform) while that person exits the train - the driver will wait for you to get back on.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Noise"]},"\n\nIt is considered very rude to be loud in a crowded place, such as in a metro car or at a restaurant. Keep in mind that, though you may be enjoying your holiday, most people around you on the ",{"type":"''","value":["métro"]}," or in other places are probably going about their daily lives and may be tired and thus will react very coldly to tourists babbling at the top of their lungs. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Shopping etiquette"]},"\n\nIn many shops in France, you must ask the shopkeeper to take items from the shelf, as opposed to picking them for yourself. This applies in liquor or wine stores, some clothing stores, etc. Failure to respect this policy might result in confused and\/or angered reactions from the shopkeeper.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Dress code"]},"\n\nDress codes are fast disappearing, but if you want to avoid looking like a tourist, then  avoid white trainers, baseball caps, tracksuit pants, shorts and flip-flops (except at the beach).  Generally speaking, business casual dress code is sufficient in cities and in all but the most formal occasions.\n\nThe usual courtesy applies when entering churches, and although you may not be asked to leave, it is better to avoid short pants and halter tops. You should remove any head gear when inside a church, contrary to when visiting a synagogue or mosque when you may be given a hat or headscarf to wear.\n\nSome restaurants will frown if you come in dressed for trekking but very few will insist upon a jacket and tie. You may be surprised by the number of French twenty-somethings who show up at a grungy bar in jacket and tie, even if obviously from a thrift-shop.\n\nBeaches and swimming pools (in hotels) are used for getting a tan. Taking off your bra will not usually create a stir if you don't mind a bevy of oglers. Taking off the bottom part is reserved to designated nude beaches. People on beaches are usually not offended by a young boy or girl undressed. Most resort cities insist on your wearing a shirt when leaving the beach area. Many pools will not allow baggy or \"board\" swim trunks, insisting on snug fitting speedo type trunks.\n\nBreastfeeding in public is very rare but nobody will mind if you do.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["How to address people (\"Tu and vous\")"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["L'anglais et les Français"],["While most people in France have studied English, they are often unable or unwilling to use it.

You should always politely ask the person if they speak English — ''\"Parlez-vous anglais?\"'"]]},"\nThe French language has two different forms of the pronoun \"you\" that are used when addressing someone in the second person. \"Tu\" is the second-person singular and \"vous\" is nominally the second-person plural.  However, in many situations, French speakers will use \"vous\" for the second-person ",{"type":"''","value":["singular."]},"  While one will use \"vous\" to address a group of people no matter what the circumstances, non-native speakers will invariably have some difficulty when trying to determine whether to address a person with the informal and friendly \"tu\" or the formal and respectful \"vous.\" The language even has two special verbs reflecting this difference: \"tutoyer\" (to address a person using \"tu\"), and \"vouvoyer\" (to address a person using \"vous\"), each of them carrying their own connotations and implications.  Unfortunately, the rules as to when to use which form can sometimes seem maddeningly opaque to the non-native French speaker.\n\nGenerally speaking, one will only use the \"tu\" form to address someone in an informal situation where there is familiarity or intimacy between the two parties.  For example, \"tu\" is used when addressing a close friend or spouse, or when an adult child is addressing a parent.  \"Tu\" is also used in situations where the other party is very young, such as a parent speaking to a child or a schoolteacher to a student.  \n\nIn contrast, \"vous\" is used in situations where the parties are not familiar, or where it is appropriate to convey respect and\/or deference.  For example, an office worker might use \"tu\" to address co-workers that he works closely with, but he would probably use \"vous\" when speaking to the receptionist whom he rarely talks to.  He certainly wouldn't use \"tu\" when speaking with his boss.  In that same vein, police officers and other authorities should ",{"type":"''","value":["always"]}," be addressed with \"vous.\"\n\nIf that's confusing the key thing to remember is that it's all about distance.  For example, a bartender is ",{"type":"''","value":["vous"]}," up until the moment that he or she gives you a complementary drink, at which point ",{"type":"''","value":["tu"]}," becomes more appropriate, and the use of ",{"type":"''","value":["vous"]}," would be a bit ungrateful and off-putting.\n\nFor foreigners, the best way to deal with the \"tu\" \/ \"vous\" problem is to address people using \"vous\" until invited to say \"tu\", or until addressed by your first name. Doing so will look perhaps a shade old fashioned, but always respectful.  In most cases, if French is not your native language most French people will overlook any such overly formal and polite language without thinking much about it anyway.  Doing the opposite can be pretty rude and embarrassing in some situations, so it's probably best to err on the side of caution.\n\nSimplified: Use ",{"type":"''","value":["vous"]}," unless:\n",{"type":"*","value":["the person is genuinely your friend;"]},{"type":"*","value":["the person is under 16; or"]},{"type":"*","value":["you've been explicitly told to use \"tu\""]},"\nIf talking to someone you don't know well enough to use ",{"type":"''","value":["tu"]}," with, you should ",{"type":"''","value":["always"]}," address them initially as ",{"type":"''","value":["Monsieur"]}," (for a man) or ",{"type":"''","value":["Madame \/ Mademoiselle"]}," (for a woman) - the issue doesn't arise with children, who are always ",{"type":"''","value":["tu"]},".  ",{"type":"''","value":["Bonjour Monsieur"]}," (for instance, on entering a shop with a male shopkeeper) is much more polite than just ",{"type":"''","value":["bonjour"]},".  But this creates further complications when addressing women.  Traditionally, ",{"type":"''","value":["Madame"]}," is used to address married women, and ",{"type":"''","value":["Mademoiselle"]}," for younger and\/or unmarried women.  However, many find the practice to be sexist, and unless you know someone prefers to be addressed as ",{"type":"''","value":["Mademoiselle"]}," it's better to use ",{"type":"''","value":["Madame"]},".  Addressing a waiter as ",{"type":"''","value":["garçon"]}," (boy) is very rude (despite what you may have seen in films).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Sensitive topics"]},"\nAs a general rule, debates, discussions, and friendly arguments are something that the French enjoy, but there are certain topics that should be treated more delicately or indirectly than others:\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Politics:"]}," French people have a wide variety of opinions about many subjects. Unless you really follow French news closely, you should probably steer clear of discussing internal French politics, especially sensitive issues such as immigration - you may come across as judgmental and uninformed.  Reading French newspapers to get a feel for the wide spectrum of political opinions in France – from the revolutionary left to the nationalistic right – may help.  That said, don't be discouraged from engaging in political discussions with French people, just be aware of the position that being a foreigner puts you in.  Also, it is considered to be quite rude to ask a person point-blank about which candidate he\/she voted for in the last election (or will vote for in the next); instead, talk about the issues and take it from there.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Religion:"]}," The French seldom advertise their religious feelings and expect you to avoid doing so as well.

It would then be \"zéro, deux, quatre, sept, six, six, quatre, un, un, huit\".\n\nYou can visit [",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.kropla.com\/dialcode.htm this site"]}," to find instructions about national and international calls.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Toll-free"]},"\nThere are few companies that provide toll-free numbers (often starting with ",{"type":"''","value":["08 00"]},") and there are also numbers which start with ",{"type":"''","value":["081"]},", for which you pay the cost of a local call regardless of where you are in the country.\n\nNumbers starting with ",{"type":"''","value":["089"]}," are heavily taxed. They provide service to some legitimate businesses but the ones you see advertised all over the country are usually for adult services.\n\nEmergency numbers are ",{"type":"'''","value":["15"]}," (medical aid), ",{"type":"'''","value":["17"]}," (police station) and ",{"type":"'''","value":["18"]}," (fire\/rescue). You can also use the European emergency number ",{"type":"''","value":["112"]}," (perhaps a better choice if you don't speak French). These calls are free and accessible from virtually any phone, including locked cellphones. In case of a ",{"type":"''","value":["serious"]}," emergency, if you find a code-protected cellphone, enter a random code three times: the phone will lock, but you will be able to dial emergency numbers.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Cheap international calls"]},"\nTo enjoy cheap international calls from France travellers can get a local France Sim Card ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.rebelfone.com\/france_simcards.asp"]}," online before they leave or use low-cost dial-around services such as \nappellemonde ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.appellemonde.fr\/"]}," or allo2556 ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.allo2556.fr\/"]},". \n\nDial-around services are directly available from any landline in France. No contract or registration is required. Most dial-around services allows you to call the USA, Canada, Western Europe and many other countries at the local rate (",{"type":"''","value":["tarif local"]},") so you can easily save on your phone bill. They also work from payphones, though the first minute is surcharged by France Télécom.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Fixed line"]},"\nTo know how to order a landline (",{"type":"''","value":["ligne fixe"]},") in France you can click on landline providers in France ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.justlanded.com\/francais\/france\/tools\/just_landed_guide\/telephone\/fixed_lines\/"]},". Another method, if you're staying for a while, is to use VoIP over DSL, such as the Livebox or Freebox service (free long distance calls within France and to a number of countries).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Phone booths"]},"\nPhone booths are available in train or metro stations, bus stops and near tourist attractions, etc.  There is at least one phone booth in every village (look on the main square). Due to the widespread use of mobile phones, there are now fewer booths than a few years ago.  Most use a card (no coins). France Télécom public phones accept CB\/Visa\/MasterCard cards but almost always only with a microchip.  Otherwise, post offices, café-tabacs (recognizable by a red sign hanging outside), and stores that sell magazines sell phone cards.  Ask for a \"carte téléphonique\"; these come with differing units of credit, so you may want to specify \"petite\" if you just want to make a short local call or two.  If you get the kind with a computer chip in it, you just have to slide it into the phone, listen for the dial tone, and dial. The US-style cards require you to dial a number and then enter a code (but with spoken instructions in French).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Mobile"]},"\nFrance uses the GSM standard of cellular phones (900 MHz and 1800 MHz bands) used in most of the world outside of the U.S. There are several companies (Orange, SFR, Free, Bouygues Télécom and some others MVNOs like Virgin Mobile) offering wireless service. The country is almost totally covered but you may have difficulties using your mobile phone in rural or mountainous areas. However, for emergency numbers, the three companies are required by law to accept your call if they technically can, even if you are not one of their customers, thus maximizing your chance of being helped even in areas with spotty service.\n\nIf you stay for some time, it may be advisable to buy a pre-paid cell phone card that you can use in any phone that supports the GSM standard on the 900\/1800 MHz bands. Then incoming calls and SMSes are free. You can get it from most mobile service provider (Orange, SFR and Bouygues Telecom), but they have a very short validity for the card if you don't recharge it.\n\nAn Orange pre-paid SIM card is called a Mobicarte, costs €9.90 and comes with a credit of €5 included. SMSes within Orange France cost €0.12; to international mobile GSM users €0.28. Other operators (SFR, Bouygues) have similar prices. Since 2012, the mobile operator Free  offers 2€\/month subscription without any minimum subscription time including 120 minutes per month and unlimited national SMSes. This is only available through the web and you need a postal address.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Internet"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Internet cafés:"]}," Internet access is available in cyber cafés all over large and medium-sized cities. Service is usually around €4 per hour.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Residential broadband:"]}," In all major cities, there are multiple companies offering residential broadband service. Typical prices are €30  a month for unmetered ADSL (with speeds of up to 24 megabits per second), digital HDTV over DSL and free unlimited voice-over-IP phone calls to land lines within France and about twenty other countries (EU, US...) with external SIP access too (the price includes a modem\/router\/switch with integrated WiFi MiMo access point).  \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Wifi:"]}," You'll also find wifi access (in cities and towns) in a lot of cafés usually those labelled a bit \"trendy\". There will be a sign on the door or on the wall.  Also look for the ",{"type":"''","value":["@"]}," symbol prominently displayed, which indicates internet availability.  However, with most homes now wired for the internet, cyber cafés are increasingly hard to find, especially outside the major cities.  In Paris, one popular free wifi spot is the Pompidou Centre.  There is talk that the city intends to become the first major European capital providing free wifi coverage for the whole city. Public parks and libraries in Paris are also covered.\nPlease note that wifi is prounonced \"wee-fee\" in France even by English speakers. Asking for \"wi-fi\" will generally not be understood.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Short-term SIM cards"]},"\n(for smartphones and tablets)\n\nOrange has nearly-unlimited Internet 1-month package for €9 called InternetMax. The official limit of 500MB is not enforced. Tethering is not allowed, but this is also not enforced. Email (POP3\/SMTP\/IMAP) is not covered, and sold as a separate package for €9 per month. P2P, VoIP and USENET are specifically banned, and risk getting your plan cancelled as well as the loss of any call credit remaining on your account.\n\nTo set this service up:\n# buy a 'mobicarte' (generic prepaid SIM card) at an Orange outlet for €9.90 which comes included with credit of €5\n# recharge it with €4 (with a credit card at an Orange outlet or with a €5-euro recharge sold at tobacco kiosks and news stands everywhere).\n# turn off mobile data connection and  disable all email applications using POP3\/IMAP\/SMTP at smartphone before inserting SIM card, otherwise it will suck up the credit well before you activate the unlimited data plan\n# wait for 24 hours for the SIM card to be activated before you can add packages\n# activate the InternetMax data plan with #123#. The menu is in French, refer to the link below for summary in English.\n# allow several hours (officially up to 48hrs) for InternetMax to be activated. There's no notification, so check it regularly: surf a bit and check your credit with #123# \n\nAs the plan is not marketed by Orange, staff at outlets and hotline operators are often completely unaware of it, and Orange website tells very little on it even in French.
