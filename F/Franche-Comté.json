Here motor-powered boats are prohibited and fishing regulated. It runs from Clairvaux-les-lacs, to Doucier Via Les Frasnois and the Cascades du Herisson. The lakes are a haven for locals on a hot weekend in June\/July and a great place for a barbecue or picnic, water tempertaures are usually around 20deg (depending on the time of year) and make for a very refreshing dip after a long hike.\n\nThe cascades (waterfalls), are a must see, while somewhat difficult in winter when the walking tracks can be frosty and slippery, it is a nature lovers heaven. Falls vary in volume of water with the rain, but range from 60m high to almost flat rapid filled rivers full of both wild and introduced trout, along the way you pass the ruins of ancient mills, which used the rivers constant flow to produce flour and other goods.\n\nAt the top of the Cascades du Herisson, is 'la Fromagerie' meaning cheese factory, there is no cheese factory here, however I believe there are plans to open a small sttore selling cheese from the region. here you will find free parking, (rather that the 5euro fee at the bottom), a wooden souviner store specialising in porducts from the area and a Friendly bar\/coffee shop run by a young French\/Australian couple with local dishes available. (if you ask nicely they will give you their WiFi Code.)They host concerts on the occasional weekend.\n\n'La vache qui rit' (the laughing cow) was founded in Lons le Saunier, the capital of Jura, and has an interactive museum open to the public for those who are fond of the world famous Cheese.\n\nAccomodation in this area consists of guesthouses and 'campings', however if you are travelling with a tent you can pitch it almost anywhere without concerning the locals (obviously discretion is to be taken) there are facilities for camper vans all over France and can be parked\/slept in in most public parking areas.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Comte AOP.jpg"],["thumb"],["A slab of Comté, a raw cow's milk cheese that is a speciality of Franche-Comté"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Comté cheese"]},", a creamy local variety of Gruyère, is a speciality.

Not the place for a quick eat, but a good place for the yes sir no sir of a traditional Jurassien restaurant.\n\nMid: 'Les Lezards' - Le Frasnois (top of Cascades du Herisson) recently opened next door to the above, run by a French-Australian couple and in a renovated barn dating to 1700s. Beautiful interior and 'brasserie' type meals. Mains Average 10 Euro, beers from 2.10 Euro 250ml. young and vibrant but family friendly with a beautiful outdoor area overlooking 'Chaux de Dombief' and the sunset over the mountains. Here you will find theme nights, local people and the occasional concert of a weekend. Don't miss out on the 'Morbiflette' a Jurassienne delicacy.
