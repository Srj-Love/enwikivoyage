Wealthy bankers, students and granola drop-outs coexist in a city that has some of the highest, most avant-garde skyscrapers of Europe next to well maintained old buildings. The downtown area, especially Römer square and the museums at the River Main, draw millions of tourists every year. On the other hand, many off the beaten track neighbourhoods, such as Bockenheim, Bornheim, Nordend and Sachsenhausen, with their intact beautiful 19th century streets and parks are often overlooked by visitors.\n\nFrankfurt is the place where Germany's major autobahns and railways intersect. About 650,000 people commute to the city each day, not counting the 660,000 people who really live here. With a huge airport — the third-largest in Europe — it is the gateway to Germany and for many people also the first point of arrival in Europe. Further, it is a prime hub for interconnections within Europe and for intercontinental flights.\n\nFrankfurt has the highest percentage of immigrants in Germany: about 25% (660,000) of Frankfurt's people have no German passport and another 10% are naturalized German citizens.

Allow extra time to locate the boarding area for your train.  Don't hesitate to ask someone for help the first time. There is a large departures signboard above the main exit\/entrance with destination and platform information, and you can also get information from the railway travel office in the station.\n\nFrom the main ticket office at Frankfurt you can buy 5 and 10 day rail travel cards which allow you to travel around Germany using all train services, including the Intercity ones.

Some of the popular apple-wine places in Bornheim are Solzer, Zur Sonne and Zur Schoenen Muellerin.\n\nDrinking apple wine: Most locals drink their apple wine with a dash of sparkling water. Just order a glass by asking for a \"Sauergespritzte\" or simply a \"Sauer\". You can also order a \"Süßgespritzte\", this is apple wine with a dash of lemonade though this might earn you some disapproving looks from the waiters and locals. If you are in a group you can also order a Bembel. This is a clay jug that comes in different sizes and keeps the apple wine cool. Try the local cider \"Apfelwein\", especially that made by Possmann.
