Although the South Island's steep, low altitude glaciers have always been dramatic in their advances and retreats, the rapidity of the present retreat is remarkable in geological time scales. Between 1893 and the end of its last big retreat 90 years later, in 1983, Franz Josef Glacier ",{"type":"''","value":["receded"]}," about 3 km. Then, between 1983 and 2008, this glacier advanced almost 1.5 km after heavy snowfalls. But in the past five years it has melted almost 820 m.\n\nThe retreat began in 2008, and in 2011 the ice thinned by about 70 m behind the glacier terminal. Then, in 2012, a huge hole opened up and guided walks were stopped. Scientists using seismometers detected \"ice quakes\" - the ground shaking from an ice collapse - as a huge cavity formed beneath the glacier, eventually causing its surface to sink into it.\n\nTourists had been flown on to the ice by helicopter, but now even this is in jeopardy.\n\nThe walk from the car park to the terminal face is now nearly 4 km and many visitors are considering visiting the larger glacier at Fox township instead. In 2011, about 330,000 people visited Franz Josef, and 184,000 went to Fox but if the rapid expansion of the enormous hole does not stop these numbers will quickly reverse.\n\nDoC is considering an emergency plan to build a new road to the rapidly retreating terminal face but The Westland National Park plan and park by-laws may have to be changed so the road can be built. Changing the plan requires public notification and will take at least eight months. DoC is also considering reviewing the limit on the number of heli-hikes allowed on the glacier.\n\nIn the last few summer months, ice has continued to collapse into the hole, which is getting bigger daily and will eventually form the new terminus, way back from the present debris-covered terminus.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["It's about 30 min from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fox Glacier"]]},"."]},{"type":"*","value":["It's about 3 hr from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Greymouth"]]},"."]},{"type":"*","value":["It's 4.5 hr from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wanaka"]]},"."]},{"type":"*","value":["It's a six hour drive from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Christchurch"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nTour buses generally make ",{"type":"'''","value":["Franz Josef"]}," one of their stops, either for the night or at least a lunch break.
