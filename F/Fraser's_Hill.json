Employing Chinese miners to do the hard work for him and earning his keep by operating mule trains down the mountain, Fraser set up opium and gambling dens to increase his profits, which may have had something to do with his subsequent mysterious disappearance.  The tin ran out in 1913, but the lush valley within was rediscovered as a colonial hill resort that, thanks to its 1524 m elevation, enjoys considerably cooler temperatures than ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kuala Lumpur"]]},".  By 1922 a road had been cut through the mountains to the valley, which soon sprouted bungalows and even one of Malaya's first golf courses.\n\nNot much has changed since, and Fraser's Hill retains a wonderfully weird mixed-up character, where locals eat curries off banana leaves in a English cottage next to a golf course while the call to prayer sounds from the mosque.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Orientation"]},"\n\nOrienting yourself in Fraser's Hill is easy enough: the entrance via the Gap is at the southwest corner of the valley and the \"center\" as such is at the intersection of Jalan Genting and Jalan Lady Guillemard, with the much-photographed ",{"type":"'''","value":["clock tower"]}," marking the spot.
