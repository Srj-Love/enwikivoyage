At the time, it was at the farthest point navigable by large ships trading goods with the Old World. Although the city became a key trading center for the plantation owners and farmers nearby, it never achieved the level of commerce enjoyed by Richmond and Alexandria.  \n\nThe city was contested during the American Civil War, changing hands numerous times between Union and Confederate forces.  The most famous battle in Fredericksburg saw Union General Burnside repeatedly march thousands of his troops across the Rappahannock River and up Marye's Heights to their doom.\n\nIn recent years, Fredericksburg's population and surrounding communities have boomed as housing costs closer to Washington, DC forced commuters to seek neighborhoods farther out.  Many living in Fredericksburg drive up to two hours or catch the VRE commuter rail to work in DC.  Fredericksburg is also a popular home for military families employed by the nearby Quantico Marine and Dahlgren Naval bases.\n\nThe downtown area has experienced a revival since the 1970's allowing a strong arts community to thrive.  Galleries, music venues, and fine dining can all be found in the historic district.  While the city has seen massive growth, the downtown area and battlefields have been well preserved due to strong local commitment to historic preservation, providing a unique blend of old and new culture.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nOne Amtrak train station serves Fredericksburg at Caroline St. and Lafayette Blvd., which is a stop for Amtrak's Carolinian and Piedmont and Regional trains.  \n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.vre.org Virginia Railway Express"]}]}," runs commuter trains between Fredericksburg's Amtrak station and Union Station in Washington, DC on weekdays from 5:15am to 8:25pm.  The trip from DC takes approximately an hour and a half, depending on freight train schedules (the railway is shared with CSX) and track work.  A single ticket from Union Station is $8.80 and discounts are offered for Ten Trip, Five Day, and Monthly passes.  VRE does not run on Federal holidays but does run special service on Independence Day.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nFredericksburg is about fifty miles south of Washington D.C. located directly on Interstate 95 at exit 130.  It is also one hour north of Richmond on Interstate 95. \n\nTravel time from the north (Washington, DC) will vary due to traffic conditions (avoid rush hour). Between 2:30PM and 7:00PM, typical travel times to Fredericksburg are from an hour and a half to two and a half hours.  Alternative routes include taking either State Highway 28 through Manassas to US Route 17, or by taking US Route 29 through Warrenton to US Route 17.  Both routes take about an hour and a half, but the traffic is much more bearable and most of the trip consists of rural driving at full speed.\n\nAnother alternative to I-95 South from Fairfax is to take the following route:\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:ChancellorsvilleBattlefieldModern.jpg"],["thumb"],["280px"],["Chancellorsville Battlefield"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Fairfax County Parkway to Hwy 123"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Hwy 123 South to right on Hwy 641 (Chapel Rd)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Hwy 641 to left on Hwy 610 (Wolf Run Shoals Rd)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Hwy 610 to right on Hwy 643 (Henderson Rd)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Hwy 643 to left on Hwy 612 (Old Yates Ford Rd)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Left onto Hwy 3000 (Prince William Parkway)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Right onto Hwy 642 (Hoadly Rd)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Left onto Hwy 234 (Dumfries Rd)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Right onto 619 (Joplin Rd)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Exit onto I-95 South"]},"\nThis way takes about one and a half hours, but you avoid the stop-and-go traffic from the mixing bowl (I-95\/I-495 interchange) all the way to the HOV merge (just south of the Dumfries\/Triangle Exit).
