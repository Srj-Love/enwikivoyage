It is on a peninsula on the south bank of the estuary of the Sierra Leone River. The city lies  at the foot of the peninsula mountains and faces one of the best natural harbours on the west coast of Africa. The peninsula is home to some of the finest beaches in Africa - Lumley beach, Lakka beach, No. 2 river beach and Toke beach are some examples.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nFreetown, like the rest of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sierra Leone"]]}," has endured some very difficult times during the civil war.  It was occupied by rebels twice and the resident population and infrastructure suffered badly.  As stability returned to Freetown, many Sierra Leoneans fled the rural areas to the city to escape the carnage.  Though the country has been peaceful since 2002, the population of the city is still much higher than it was prior to the war.  This has put pressure on land and local services.  Many areas of jungle have been cleared to house the new residents.  Some claim that the US government has not helped the situation with their new embassy development at Leicester.  Some blame the new developments for severe flooding of the city during the rainy season.  Deforestation has also been blamed for a shortage of water in the city.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Freetown International Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["FNA"]]},"), in Lungi (",{"type":"''","value":["on the other side of the estuary from Freetown"]},"), Tel: (232-22)-338405.  As of early 2013, the ongoing refurbishment of the airport is nearly complete.  Departure procedures, which used to be very difficult are not not a problem.  Airport facilities and experience compare favourably with other countries in the region.\n\nGetting from the airport to Freetown can be a challenge and the safety of the various operators has been questioned.  There are a number of fast boat services that cross the estuary, and most foreign visitors use this option for roughly US$40. To pick them up, just walk to the right after exiting the airport building. Sea Coach Express (Pelican Water Taxis) operate small boats, some covered, some not, from Mahera Hotel to the Aberdeen bridge for Le180,000 (40USD). The hovercraft service has resumed under the Helog name.  It arrives\/departs from Man of War Bay, Aberdeen.  The crossing can be unpleasant if the sea is rough. The Pelican and hovercraft are convenient for most foreign travellers as they avoid the slow route through the crowded east end of Freetown.  The helicopter now only operates a charter service.\n\nAnother possibility is on the overloaded ferry which runs to the main part of Freetown. A seat on a bus which uses the ferry costs Le60,000.  The bus takes passengers to Rawdon Street in the center of Freetown.  This trip can take 3+ hours and has been known to take 8 hours. By road it is 4+ hours to the city, via Port Loko using some poor roads.\n\nFinally, some private boats cross the estuary. This is not recommended at night.\n\nUnfortunately, thefts from hold baggage were very common at the airport, especially on the way out of the country. There have been recent improvements to security.  It is still wise to carry anything of value in your cabin luggage. Having your checked baggage wrapped in cellophane at your point of origin is another good tactic.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sierra Leone"]]},"'s public railway service was closed in 1974.  A railway museum has been opened at Cline Town and is well worth a visit.  Many of the original railway buildings and signs can still be seen in and around Freetown, particularly at Hill Station and Congo Cross.  It is also possible to walk along much of the track bed, starting near the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.capitalradio.sl\/hsc.htm Hill Station Club"]}," and dropping down the hill via Congo Cross into Freetown.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nMany roads in Freetown are being reconstructed and a bypass road is also being built to link the western part of Freetown to the rest of the country, cutting out the congested eastern part of town.  The roads via Leicester and along the coastal part of the Freetown peninsular are also being reconstructed.  Work has made good progress on the roads through Aberdeen and Lumley, including the beach road which is almost complete.  Unfortunately, the Sierra Leone Roads Authority have given up maintaining other roads, which means they are increasingly in poor condition.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Freetown overview map.png"],["thumb"],["600px"],["City overview"]]},"\n\nLocal taxis run fixed routes and are shared rides. For the uninitiated, there is no real way to figure out where they are going, and they're busy making a living rather than trying to explain everything to foreigners. But they're so cheap (1,000 leones), you can just hail one and see how long it takes you the right way before making a turn! Empty taxis will assume that foreigners want to charter a taxi (see below) and not share it. To let them know you prefer a shared ride, just declare \"no cha cha\" when you get on board.\n\n",{"type":"''","value":["Poda-podas"]}," are a more miserable shared ride option, but are more straightforward for longer trips, as they display their start and end points on the front of the vehicle. If only you knew what those landmarks meant! \"Lumley\" will take you to Lumley Beach via the southern bridge, \"Aberdeen\" will take you to Aberdeen via the north bridge from Murray Town, \"Eastern Police\" will take you to the big clock tower at Kissy Road on the East Side (this is a good place to get dropped off to find a poda-poda to Waterloo), and there are others that hopefully other Wikivoyagers will figure out and write about here. If you are looking for downtown, locals call it \"Tong.\"\n\nOne can approach a taxi and charter it (cha cha) for a few hours, a day, or even days if one wishes. A decent price per hour is about $5, for a day around $50. Taxis can be hired for a complete journey, which really should not exceed the equivalent of $4 for a trip within Freetown. The drivers do expect to be negotiated with, so don't be scared—be cheeky and negotiate! A very convincing bargaining tactic is to let the driver know that, if he gives you a good price and you like his service, you will keep him on your speed dial for longer chartered rides. Having a trusted taxi driver on your phone shortlist is generally a very good idea for female travelers, anyway.\n\nHowever, if you feel this isn't the route for you, hotel taxis are usually available in much better condition; and they are regulated. These will also cost up to around $10.\n\nCar hire is possible and can normally be arranged through the hotels or local car dealerships. They will normally come with a driver. Journeys outside of Freetown often may require a 4-wheel drive vehicle and will cost more, typically $150 plus fuel per day, including driver.\n\nHowever, if you wish to mingle with the locals—which is encouraged, as it creates more social inclusion—you may be surprised. Local people can help you find your way around town, hire taxis for you, and introduce you to their friends and families and, in some cases, ceremonies taking place. They can also cook for you, as Sierra Leoneans are very hospitable people. Many tourists tend to fall in a trap where they visit and hang around with only familiar people. It's better to see visiting Sierra Leone as a social\/cultural holiday, allowing visitors and locals to exchange customs and at the same time experience the \"diamond in the rough.\" Seeing the good and bad parts is what makes visiting Sierra Leone an experience to remember.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Freetown Railway Museum.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Old locomotives at the National Railway Museum."]]},"\n\nMany of Freetown's attractions are underdeveloped and not well publicised.  The relatively low numbers of tourists visiting has meant there was not adequate incentive or financial reward for developing them.  However, there are many hidden gems that can be well worth finding.

For a nice speedboat from Aberdeen, where the speedboats leave for Lungi Airport, you'll need about $300.\n\nNeither option guarantees much guidance when you actually arrive, though. The 95-some-odd-year-old caretaker, Pa Braima Bangura, retired in 2011, but will still join you if you pick him up in ",{"type":"'''","value":["Pepel"]},", the village across the narrow on the north side of the river.

Interestingly, his guidance diverges pretty strongly from the information available on the internet, so you can decide who knows what's what!\n\nSo, if you are a solo traveller without $150 to blow, this becomes a gruelling adventure. The most sensible way to do this (and it's anything but sensible), is to catch a passenger boat (one of the long dugout wooden motorized fastboats) from Big Wharf (to the east of Kissy) in Freetown straight to Pepel (~$2). There will in all likelihood be only one of these per day, only on weekdays, and it should leave around 3PM or so, so you would need to be there earlier to make sure you get on it. Try to see Bunce Island upon arrival, so you can catch the fastboat back early in the morning, after staying in Pepel with the permission of the chief (budget a good $15-20 in leones so that you are able to pass 10,000 notes to all the necessary hands). Realistically, this won't work, though. So plan to spend the morning going to the island, then return to Pepel and hire a moto-taxi to take you on the 90 minute dust-choked journey back to Tagrin (~$5-10) to catch the Ferry to either Kissy or Government Wharf in Freetown. The boat back and forth to Bunce Island from Pepel, including waiting, is going to run at least $30 in leones.
