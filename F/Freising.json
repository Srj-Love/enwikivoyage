Freising is probably best known for the world's oldest brewery, a former monastery, and the fact that a big part of the world's brewers have learned their profession at the city's university.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nEven though archaeological finds show that the area was settled in the Bronze Age, there is no evidence that there existed a continous settlement until the 8th century, when Saint Corbinian settled at a shrine on ",{"type":"''","value":["Weihenstephan"]}," hill in 724. Corbinian was the forerunner and first bishop of the diocese of Freising. Freising quickly became an important town and religious center in Bavaria, and therefore emperor Otto III granted the settlement city rights in 996. The town significance sharply declined, though, when Duke Henry the Lion destroyed Freising's Isar bridges and salt works in 1158, to boost his own Isar crossing in Munich, which by the time was a mere toll station. However, the prince-bishopric of Freising kept its independence and religious importance until the beginning of the 19th century, when it was politically seized by Bavaria and religiously merged with the diocese of Munich.\n\nDuring World War II Freising was only of minor importance and moreover housed a military hospital for foreign officers, and was therefore considered safe from attacks and destruction. The only major air raid was conducted short before the end of the war on 18.04.1945 against the city's station. On 29.04.1945 Freising surrendered to the approaching American troops (after a brief artillery bombardment), but the retrackting SS managed to blow up the city's main bridge in an attempt to delay the American advance.\n\nFreising's economical resurgence and major growth began with the planning and construction of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Munich Airport"]]},", which was opened in 1992 on the city's territory. Today Freising is an economic heavyweight, with one of the highest population growth rates and lowest unemployment rates in Germany. The city's university, which is part of the Technical University Munich, is renowned in the field of life science, agriculture, and brewing technology, and the research institutes in its surroundings are famous in the scientific community. The city's most famous institution, however, is '''''Weihenstephan",{"type":"''","value":[" brewery'"]},", which was founded in 1040 and therefore is the world's oldest brewery.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nThe city is easily reachable by plane via ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Munich Airport"]]},", which in fact is located on Freising's territory.
