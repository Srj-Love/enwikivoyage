The city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Newark (California)"],["Newark"]]},", near the edge of the Bay, is surrounded by the city of Fremont.\n\nFremont industry is not particularly large relative to other parts of the Bay Area, but neither is it a bedroom community.  Many people in Fremont work locally in the electronics and high-tech industry, while many others commute to Silicon Valley or San Francisco locations for work.  Fremont, however, is growing again and attracting more and larger businesses; for example, Tesla Motors has taken over the former NUMMI factory owned by Toyota and General Motors.\n\nThe city is home to one of California's \"original Hollywood's\", the Niles district where many of Charlie Chaplin and other silent movie era stars established their careers.  It is also home to one of California's missions, and many other interesting destinations.\n\nThe City of Fremont is named after Civil War general John C. Fremont, who prior to the war in the mid 1840s had mapped a trail through Mission Pass to provide access for American settlers into the southeastern San Francisco Bay Area.  John Fremont was one of California's first senators and went on to be the first U.S. presidential candidate for the Republican Party.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Missionpeakstanford.jpg"],["thumb"],["Mission Peak is visible throughout Fremont."]]},"\n\nUnlike most sprawling suburbs, Fremont was planned and designed to be the way it is.\nIn the 1950s, fearing that they would be annexed by the growing city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hayward"]]}," to the north, eight very small towns decided to unite to avoid annexation.  Two towns (Alvarado and Decoto) closest to\nHayward quickly incorporated into Union City.  The six remaining towns got together and\nextensively planned how things would be.  Space was allocated both for industry and homes.\nSpace for roads large enough to support the massive traffic flows was set aside.  One of the\nsmall towns (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Newark (California)"],["Newark"]]},") dropped out of the coalition because it was slated to become an industrial zone.  The five remaining towns -- (Centerville, Niles, Irvington, Mission San Jose, and Warm Springs, from north to south - annexed all the surrounding land to form the City of Fremont.\n\nThe oldest of the small towns was Mission San José, named for a Spanish mission founded in 1797.  When this Mission was founded it was named \"La Mision del Gloriosisimo Patriarch San José\" in honor of St. Joseph.  It is sometimes incorrectly called the Mission San José de Guadalupe, after \"El Pueblo de San José de Guadalupe\" founded (1777) 20 miles south near the Guadalupe River, which became the present day city of San Jose.\n\nFremont has been multicultural since its inception, and is home to dozens of immigrant communities and a broad range of ethnicities.  Today's visitor is likely to hear half a dozen languages spoken even during a fleeting trip through the city.  It is said that the largest population of Afghanis outside Afghanistan live in Fremont, and it also has a large and growing south Asian community as well.\n\nBecause of their entangled history and their present sprawl that makes them blend into one another, the three cities—Fremont, Newark, and Union City—are sometimes called the Tri-Cities.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oakland"]]}," Airport (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["OAK"]]},") is about 20–40 minutes away by car via I-880 depending on the time of day.

Although the two freeways are only a mile apart in Fremont-Warm Springs, they do not intersect.  Motorists will find travel to be very slow during commute hours in the unfavorable direction; especially so on I-880.\n\nMission Blvd crosses I-680 twice at Exits 16 and 12.
