This is especially true at spawning time, when the river and banks are loaded with fishermen and State Wildlife Inspectors. Fremont is a beautiful city, with well maintined residential neighborhoods. Due to the location, it is a destination for those who enjoy Lake Erie and would prefer to be a bit away from the lake front and the little bit faster pace of life. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["SR 20 NW\/SE"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["SR 53 N\/S"]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\nIf you are trying to access the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Sandusky River"]},", the only marina between here and Lake Erie can be accessed by the 1st road south of  the turnpike on the east side of the road.

Then new laws and testing devices were provided to law officers. Today, they have laws against smoking in public areas that includes bars and clubs. This new regulation and enforcement has taken much out of the bar scene in Ohio, leaving only the unaware or hard core patrons in the taverns. From Fremont north to Lake Erie, drinking while driving or in control of watercraft is enforced like never before. Fines and jail terms are usually mandatory.
