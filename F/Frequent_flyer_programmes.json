[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Generic flying banner.jpg"]]},"\nA ",{"type":"'''","value":["frequent flyer programme"]}," is a type of loyalty programme run by an airline or several airlines in conjunction, rewarding frequent passengers with extras and bonuses, and providing facilities aiding air travel with the particular airline(s). The history of modern frequent flyer programmes started in 1970s and involved rapid evolution with best practice spreading across the world. Therefore, most frequent flyer programmes are very similar and designed along the same lines.\n\nDo note that although frequent flier programmes offer glamourous benefits to those who participate, those are mostly available only to the truly frequent fliers, who not only fly frequently but also spend significant amounts of money on air travel. Fulfilling the conditions required to get most benefits can be hard for a casual traveller, and the frequent flier programmes are intended to divert from seeking optimal solutions, such as using competing carriers or purchasing the cheapest tickets. Navigating through the peculiarities of frequent flier programmes can require much research and attention in order to maximize your benefits and avoid pitfalls.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Principles and economics of operation "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:JMB-New card.JPG"],["thumbnail"],["As a member of a ",{"type":"''","value":["frequent flyer programme"]},", you're likely to receive a membership card like the one above for Japan Airlines."]]},"\nAs in many other retail industries, airlines set aside a certain percentage of income on every ticket sold to fund a loyalty scheme to the reward recurring customers. Frequent flier programmes are used to entice travellers to consistently choose one airline over another, as well as entice additional travel. \n\nDo note that if an airline runs a frequent flier programme, ",{"type":"'''","value":["you pay for it"]}," with every bit you spend with the airline, and it is up to you to collect the benefits.

The \"air miles\" are the \"currency\" of the programme collected during participation and their amount is important to getting benefits.\n\nWhile \"air miles\" were born out of the idea of awarding frequent fliers literally per every mile flown in the air, the economics of the airline business dictate many simplifications to the rule. For example, in most programmes, short-haul flights yield a fixed amount of points tied more to booking class (which in turn determines the price paid for the ticket) than actual distance covered. Flying ",{"type":"[[","value":[["First and business class travel"],["first or business class"]]}," usually yields many more miles per flight than economy, usually by a factor of at least three, and two to one for first and business class versus economy, respectively.\n\nBoth because of the above and to provide unique identities to their programmes, many airlines choose to name the points collected in their programmes in a way unrelated to distance, e.g. ",{"type":"''","value":["Avios"]}," in British Airways'  frequent flyer programme ",{"type":"''","value":["Executive Club"]},". ",{"type":"''","value":["Miles"]},", however, remain the most popular \"currency\" across frequent flyer programmes, regardless of whether the home country of the airline uses imperial or metric measurements. That said, some programmes run by airlines from countries using the metric system call their points \"kilometres\" rather than \"miles\".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Collecting miles "]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Airline flights "]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["Who gets the miles?"],["Note that for most frequent flyer programmes, it is irrelevant who purchased and paid for the ticket. The only thing that counts is who has actually flown, and since your identity is checked and proofed against the name the ticket was bought for at most airports, the airlines have a high chance of knowing who actually flew. That means that on the one hand, you collect your frequent flier benefits both for air travel you paid for yourself, and for travel paid by someone else, e.g. your employer \/ company or tickets bought for you as a gift. On the other hand, if you purchase tickets for other people, even if they are travelling with you, you only get miles for the flights you completed personally; your companions or people you bought tickets for can only collect miles in their own name."]]},"\nThe most straightforward way of collecting miles is by completing flights with the airline running the programme. Some programmes, as stated above, allow participants to collect miles by flying with selected other airlines as well. One is generally awarded miles only for the flights actually completed, which means that if you pay for a ticket but do not board the plane for any reason, whether you cancelled your booking or not, you are not getting the miles. Miles are usually credited to your account only after the flight is completed, so if you want to add miles to your account fast, you will have to fly shortly as well.\n\nEvery flight has a predetermined amount of miles it will add to your account once completed, and you can usually learn it when booking. The airline's booking system will usually show you the amount of miles per flight and booking class when you are arranging your travel, so that you can factor this in when deciding on a particular connection.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Non-airline partners "]},"\nMost frequent flier programmes allow one to collect miles for the services of their partners, most travel-related, such as hotels, car rental companies, airport retailers and such. Many of those partners maintain their own loyalty schemes and one is allowed to collect points on either of them - i.e. collecting miles for booking a hotel will not allow you to collect points in the hotel chain's loyalty scheme. There are, however, exceptions to the rule and if collecting loyalty points and miles is important to you, you should read the small print carefully.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Affiliated credit cards "]},"\nA popular offshoot of frequent flier programmes are affiliated credit cards, i.e. credit cards that allow one to collect extra miles by using them for payment, and often also simply by opening and maintaining the credit card account. This is done by the operator of the credit card, usually a bank or other financial institution, paying the airline to credit you with the miles. You are probably aware that using a credit card costs both you (in the fees and interest you see on your card statement) and the retailer that accepts the card (who pays to the operator an amount undisclosed to you), which is what the miles are funded out of.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Expiration "]},"\nIn many programmes, award miles or points do \"expire\" (disappear from your account) after a certain period of time passes, counted from when they were earned. This \"expiration period\" is often prolonged for frequent fliers who fulfill a certain condition, e.g. acquire a status or use the affiliated credit card. Some programmes offer the possibility of earning the privilege of \"non expiring\" miles.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Redeeming miles "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Maquette ATR72 Azul au Capitole de Toulouse.JPG"],["250px"],["thumbnail"],["right"],["One of the ways of obtaining such an aircraft scale model is by purchasing it from a travel shop with your frequent flier miles"]]},"\nUtilizing miles is the sweetest part for flyers. Usually the best value for miles are award flights but always watch out for special offer of affiliate partners of the programme. Individual programmes allows also points\/miles + cash tickets. If that is interesting depends on the ratio miles\/cash in comparison to the cost spent for miles.\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Award flights "]},"\nAn award flight is a flight that is \"awarded\" to you in exchange for a certain amount of points. Basically, it means that you can pay for your flight using the accumulated miles rather than money. This is the most common way of utilizing one's air miles.\n\nAirlines will often publish a fixed table of award flight \"prices\", listing the amount of miles required to fly between particular destinations or regions (e.g. between Europe and Middle East - 30 000 miles). Apart from that, there are often \"mileage promotions\" that offer particular connections at lower mileage values than usual. Award flights can be most often booked both as return or one-way flights, and with a choice of travel class, both affecting the mileage value of the flight. Many airlines that are part of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["airline alliances"]]}," allow redemption for flights within the own alliances. In general the availability for award flights is better for own flights than with other alliance carriers. Usually award flights can be booked 365 days in advance.\n\nMost airlines include only the ",{"type":"'''","value":["airfare"]}," part in award tickets. There are more components to the ticket price, such as security and ground handling surcharges, airport fees, taxes and so on. Therefore, especially on short flights between busy airports, there can still be a considerable sum to be paid for an \"award flight\". Some airlines allow this part of the ticket price to be paid with air miles as well, usually under a separate scheme - so you may have to spend twice as much or more miles on a ticket than the offer originally stated.\n\nSome airlines have simpler frequent flier systems, where accumulated points simply go towards prices of regular tickets - one can purchase a ticket once the value of the points accumulated is equal or higher to its price. Moreover, some airlines allow for a purchase of the ticket with combinations of points and money.\n\nAirlines reserve  a certain amount of seats for award tickets on all flights. Depending on the expected demand this number of seats will be increased or completely closed. The best option is to either book very early or to check the load factor (i.e. what percentage of available seats is sold) for short-term bookings. Tools like KVS or expertflyer are only a good investment if you use award tickets often.\n\nDo bear in mind that, appraising the amount of money needed to gain a certain amount of miles, and checking versus the prices you can pay for a regular ticket on a given route, short-haul award flights and generally award flights in Economy Class may not be really good deals. You may be able to purchase the same ticket at a very attractive price using cash and with less restrictions, if the given airline runs frequent promotion and the route is generally either highly competitive or underutilized. The best value for miles in most programmes are First or Business class longhaul award flights.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Upgrade awards "]},"\nAnother way to use your award miles is to \"upgrade\" yourself to a higher travel class. This is done by purchasing a regular ticket in a lower booking class and then using a certain amount of points to book an upgrade, depending on availability.\n\nIt is usually only possible to upgrade oneself one class up, e.g. from Economy to Business or from Business to First. Do note that on flights that offer \"enhanced Economy Class\" (called \"Economy Comfort\", \"Economy Plus\" or the like - usually a costlier Economy class seat which offers more legroom, better location on a plane or some other enhancements), you can usually only upgrade to Business Class if you purchased your ticket in said \"enhanced Economy\".\n\nDo note that airlines also \"upgrade\" their frequent fliers with high status at no cost, both to offer them an added benefit and to open seats in Economy in cases of overbooking. If on your connection it is usually full in Economy and empty in Business and\/or First, chances are high you will be upgraded if you are a \"status\" frequent flier. Those days, however, most airlines have sophisticated revenue\/load management systems and rather offer upgrades for lower mileage amounts to all frequent fliers rather than do it for free.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Third-party awards "]},"\nIf a frequent-flyer programme has a partnership with a \"third party\", such as a hotel chain or car rental company, it is usually a two-way one. Not only can you earn miles using the \"third party's\" services, but you can also use your miles to purchase their services, e.g. book a hotel room or rent a car.  The value for miles of such offers is often rather low, as in such cases the airline has to actually pay the \"third party\" for the services, rather than just give you a free seat on a flight that takes place anyway, and whose cost was usually long calculated into ticket prices for paying passengers. That said, in some cases and under certain conditions, you may find a good deal.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Travel shops "]},"\nSome frequent flier programmes with extensive membership run special online-based travel shops, were frequent fliers may purchase certain goods with their miles, and often also with money or a combination of miles and money. The goods on offer are usually airline- branded travel accessories and luggage, as well as certain gadgets such as model airplanes, stuffy toys or even limited-series Swiss watches. Such shops may be an interesting option of using your miles if you do not have enough for your dream flight and your miles are about to expire, or to procure a unique gift.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Donating miles to charity "]},"\nFinally, many frequent flier programmes cooperate with one or more charities and offer the option of \"donating\" your miles to them, which basically means the airline will pay a certain amount of money to the charity per every mile you donate.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Frequent flyer status "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Ffpcard of jpn's airlines.jpg"],["250pspx"],["thumbnail"],["right"],["Like many other airlines, Japan Airlines has different colour-coded cards for customers with different frequent-flier statuses, accompanied by a fancy name for each status level"]]},"\nA second type of benefits, and one of the most coveted, is the frequent flier status that is usually awarded to those participants of the programme that fulfill certain conditions. This status then yields additional automatic benefits to the participant, not requiring \"spending\" any extra \"miles\".\n\nUsually, the status is awarded to a programme participant who collects a given amount of \"miles\" within a certain period. Alternatively, some airlines award the status to a participant who flies a certain amount of flights \/ flight segments during a period. Oftentimes, one can attain a status either way\n\nMost programmes evoled to provide a multi-tiered status structure, i.e. one can attain many different status levels depending on the amount of miles \/ flights. The higher the status (i.e. the more miles \/ flights are required to attain it), the more benefits and higher their attractiveness, at least in theory.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Status benefits "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Diamond Premiere Lounge of Tokyo International Airport Domestic03s3.jpg"],["250px"],["thumbnail"],["right"],["Attaining a higher status with a frequent flier programme can give one constant access to airport lounges normally reserved for business- and first-class travellers, such as this one at Tokyo Haneda Airport"]]},"\n\nMany of the benefits you can attain by acquiring a certain status in the frequent flier programme are the benefits usually given to passengers flying business and\/or first class. The difference is that \"status\" frequent fliers get them, in principle, every time they fly, regardless of whether they fly first, business or economy. Other benefits can only be acquired by attaining the \"status\".\n\nThe benefits you can attain by acquiring a certain status in the frequent flier programme may typically include:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Fast-track boarding"]}," - you will be allowed to board the aircraft at the gate before other passengers, and often be able to use a separate (quicker) security clearance beforehand.

While every \"mile\" earned with the programme is, by default, an \"award\" mile, which means it accumulates on your account and can be redeemed for a reward\/award, only some of those miles are \"status\" miles that count towards your status. This means that the airline will maintain two accounts for your miles, one for your \"award miles\", and the other for your \"status miles\".\n\nTypically, only miles for flights with the particular airline who runs the frequent flier programme yield status miles. All auxilliary means of attaining miles (purchases with non-airline partners in particular or miles for using an affiliated credit card) usually yield award miles only and no status miles. Travelling with partner airlines and mileage promotions may or may not yield extra status miles and you should better check this if collecting status miles is important to you.\n\nStatus miles are, in almost all cases, award miles at the same time, so a flight that adds 100 miles to your status mile account will also add 100 miles to your award mile account. This does not work the other way around, so a hotel booking that adds 100 miles to your award mile account will probably add nothing to your status mile account.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Acquiring and retaining status "]},"\nYour status with the frequent flyer programme changes when you reach a certain number of status miles earned, flights or flight segments completed on your account. Your status is usually updated automatically, you should require a notification and a new shiny card reflecting that shall usually be sent your way. Do note that your status changes whenever the miles or flights are booked to your account, which may take days or weeks after you complete the flights earning you those.\n\nThe programmes usually impose a period during which one has to complete the status-earning flights or collect status miles to earn a status. Some airlines require it to be done within one calendar year (so if you start in December you have very little chance of earning the status), and reset your status account at the start of every new year (which usually does not affect your award miles). Other airlines have a rolling status period, usually also lasting 12 months, during which you can earn your status. This means flights and status miles older than 12 months are not counted towards your status, but all other are, regardless of the calendar year they were earned in.\n\nThe status is usually awarded for a year or two years, during which period you are usually required to fulfill the same requirements (number of status miles or flights) to retain it as you would to gain it. Some older and more complicated frequent flyer programmes had included the possibility of earning statuses for a lifetime after amassing a very large amount of miles, but this is becoming a very rare case.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Other conveniences "]},"\nWhile ostensibly the attraction of frequent flier programmes is the possibility to earn awards and acquire the status, there are also other systematic benefits that are available to all participants and can be a reason to participate even for a relatively in-frequent flier.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:HAJ-Etix machines.jpg"],["250px"],["thumbnail"],["right"],["Members of the Miles & More frequent flier programme can check in, print boarding passes and perform numerous other actions after identifying themselves with their frequent flyer card at Lufthansa automated kiosks like those."]]},"\n\nIn recent years, airlines started using the cards issued to frequent flier programme participants as identification devices across all communications channels. This way, participants do not have to remember all of their flight details (reservation number, flight number, e-ticket number etc.), but can simply identify themselves by presenting the card to a service agent (provided the agent has access to the programme's computer system) or automated kiosks. One of the most often used facility is checking in and printing out boarding passes at the airport in automated kiosks, which helps save time and allows one to book their tickets without bothering a travel agent or accessing a printer.\n\nMost airlines also allow frequent flier programme participants to log in to sections their websites offering enhanced functionalities, such as:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Quick access to bookings made or considered (one can \"save\" a flight for later consideration without making a booking), which helps one make quick changes without the need to know each booking's details beforehand"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Ability to enter personal data and preferences both for oneself and frequent travel companions and then use it for every booking.

This means that one can accrue the same benefits (by flying the same number of flights or \"air miles\") by spending very different amounts of money, or put the other way around, find oneself having very different benefits when spending the same amount of money with an airline.\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flight segments vs flights"]},"\nMany airlines distinguish between flight segments and flights, i.e. a direct flight with not stopovers and changeovers from London to Warsaw is both one flight and one segment, but a flight from London to Warsaw with a changeover in Copenhagen is one flight but two flight segments. For status purposes, the number of segments flown is often counted rather than the number of flights. There is also often a fixed amount of miles per every flight segment, especially on short-haul routes, so multi-segment short-haul flights will yield more miles than direct ones.\n\nFrequent fliers will often choose multi-segment flights over direct, if they can, to accrue more miles and flight segments to their accounts.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Corporate loyalty schemes "]},"\nWhile frequent flyer programmes are strictly personal (i.e. earning miles and status is strictly limited to a particular person identified by name), many airlines also run concurrent corporate loyalty schemes, awarding \"miles\" or bonus points to corporations that purchase their tickets, regardless of who is actually travelling. This is to entice corporations and corporate travel planners to use the particular airline.\n\nSuch corporate loyalty schemes work very similarly to frequent flyer programmes in that miles earned per every flight, more or less proportionally to the money spent on the tickets, or at least to the profitability of those tickets to the airline, may be converted to \"award flights\". They, however, rarely if ever award \"statuses\" to participating companies. The company can freely decide how to use their \"award miles\" - for example, the corporate travel planners who rarely fly by themselves may get award flights as a bonus for their work planning travel for others.\n\nThe corporate loyalty scheme is usually run alongside the frequent flyer programme and both are complimentary rather than mutually exclusive, so that while a passenger continues to earn their miles, the corporation car earn theirs for the same flights. This means that every ticket, regardless of how it is purchased, contains a small contribution towards the corporate programme as well, although much less of those are actually realized than in the case of frequent flyer programmes, as many tickets are not bought by corporations, or purchased by companies who do not care to participate, either because they are too small, there is no person to be interested to find out about the programme or the corporation rules make using the corporate miles impossible.\n\nWhile frequent flyer programmes are often shared across airlines and allow a high degree of mutual recognition (earning and spending miles between airlines), corporate loyalty schemes may be much more limited in scope and often cover one airline only.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["guidetopic"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["PartOfTopic"],["Flying"]]}]
