The Save Mart Center at California State University, Fresno (\"Fresno State\") has also played host to concerts featuring high-profile acts.\n\nWinter weather typically features highs around 60 degrees Fahrenheit, and \"extreme\" lows in the low to mid 30s, often with morning fog and sometimes frost. Rain fall is sparse and occurs exclusively in winter and early spring months. Most rain storms last less than 2 days and are often spread weeks apart. It is not uncommon to experience hail, however it is very rare to see snow fall on the valley floor. The few times it does snow, the snow rarely sticks over night. While winter temperatures can reach below freezing, most all storms feature \"warm fronts\" that more or less eliminate the chance for snow (mid to low 40s is a typical \"cold\" rain storm).\n\nSummer temperatures average in the mid-90s. Days with high temperatures 110 degrees or above are not uncommon. Humidity is only around 20% in the afternoon, though, making for a more bearable dry heat. The chance to find 110+ degree days commonly occurs beginning late July and continuing to mid August. During these days the low nighttime temperature will only get down to the mid 80s. It is common for a heat wave to last two weeks.\n\nFresno's most famous son is the writer William Saroyan, after whom is named a local theater.

There is a modest bus system, Fresno Area Express (FAX), but a car would be advised. Traffic congestion in Fresno is not as bad as larger places in California, but Shaw and Herndon avenues can get quite crowded, especially since there is no east-west freeway through the north side. CA-99 runs along the west side of the city, becoming semi-rural before exiting Fresno County on the northwest side of Fresno. CA-41 runs down the middle of the city. Until the late 1990s and early 2000s these were the only freeways in Fresno, but a surge in growth has spurred the development of the CA-180 and CA-168 freeways.\n\nIn 2011, Fresno became the first town or city in the Central Valley to earn a Bronze Medal Designation from the League of American Bicyclists, recognizing Fresno as a bicycle friendly community.  The city is in the process of further expanding its bike lanes in an effort to improve bike access.  For a current map of Fresno's bike lanes, follow this link.
