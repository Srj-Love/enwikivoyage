The municipality Súdwest-Fryslân and the upcoming municipality De Friese Meren belong to this area.

If you have (or rent) a larger boat, staying on it is the obvious solution and provides great freedom in terms of where to go. If you're looking for hotels or B&B's, it's a good option to pick a base and make day-trips over the lakes from there, which, given the size of the area is very well possible and perhaps most convenient.
