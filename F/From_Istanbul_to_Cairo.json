It is a route that has been traveled for centuries, particularly during the Ottoman empire. Historically it overlapped with the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hajj"]]},", with many people covering all or part of the route as part of their pilgrimage to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mecca"]]},".\n\nBackpackers discovered it in the '70s and '80s, with hippies searching for spiritual peace who departed to Jerusalem from Istanbul instead of going to India via Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan. After the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel, onward travel from Jerusalem to Cairo became a possibility. For visa reasons (see below) the route is almost always traveled Istanbul-Cairo, few choose to go the opposite direction. The guide book series Lonely Planet made the route even more popular by publishing their \"Istanbul to Cairo on a shoestring\".\n\nSee also ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tips for travel in developing countries"]]},"; advice there applies to most of this route.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Prepare"]}," \nIt is essential to have a good guidebook and learn some basic rules of Middle Eastern etiquette. Like don't use your left hand, because it is considered dirty (traditionally the left hand is used to clean yourself with water after using the toilet), and do not put your feet up on furniture used as a foot stool.  Always wear long trousers, not shorts, and t-shirts instead of muscle shirts. At the very least, knees and shoulders should be covered. Long flowing ankle-length skirts and loose fitting men's t-shirts are recommended clothing for women. A headscarf is not necessary, but useful to have when visiting Orthodox churches and mosques. Learning basic survival-level Arabic is very helpful. \n\nAs the area is volatile and subject to sudden political changes, it is essential to listen closely to the news before and during your trip. Read the travel warnings issued by your government carefully and heed them. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Visa"]}," \nMost travelers from Western countries can get visas for Turkey, Egypt, Jordan and Israel at the airport or at the border. Syria requires travelers to apply beforehand at the embassy of their country of residence. Travelers from a country which does not have diplomatic relationship with Syria can reportedly get the visa at the Syrian border too, but there seems to be no certain rule about it.\n\nOne reliable alternative for securing a Syrian visa is to apply at the Syrian Embassy in Istanbul.  Processing time has been reported to be less than 8 hours, so it is possible to apply in the morning and return later in the afternoon to retrieve your passport.\n\nSince Syria is technically still at war with Israel, any proof of a past or future visit to Israel will result in being denied entry to Syria, even with a valid visa. Thus people intending to visit Israel on their trip travel from Turkey to Egypt, not the other way around. It is possible to keep a visit to Israel out of your passport if you enter and leave Israel through the Allenby-King Hussein bridge border crossing and request the Israeli officials to stamp a piece of paper instead of your passport, but this method is not very reliable.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Tickets"]}," \nIt is difficult or not practical to pre-order bus or train tickets online as most ticketing in the Middle East is still done by hand, although you can book airline tickets online nowadays. Travel agents in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Istanbul"]]},"'s Sultanahmet area can be of help for some parts of the trip and it can be worthwhile to email a trustworthy agent for help and pay for your tickets with credit card.
