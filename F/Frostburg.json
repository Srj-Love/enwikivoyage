The town is home to ",{"type":"'''","value":["Frostburg State University"]}," and has a lively variety of student-oriented pubs. Frostburg has a slow, but rich history. Being one of the primary coach stops along the historic National Road, the town is built centered along Route 40 and is truly a Main Street community. The town is positioned in the Appalachian mountains, and its best attraction is its natural surroundings. From the center of town, once can take in a gorgeous, panoramic view of the surroundings mountains. Because of this natural setting, a wide range of outdoor, recreational activities are easily within reach. Frostburg is one of the primary stops along the Rails to Trails cycle path which connects Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C. Garrett County is just minutes away by car and is the least-densely populated region in Maryland, offering excellent opportunities for hiking, cycling, mountain-biking, kayaking, white-water rafting, skiing, and many other outdoor pursuits.\n\nFrostburg itself can seem a sleepy town at times, especially when the university isn't in session. Yet the newly designated \"Arts and Entertainment District\" has spurred local growth, and an afternoon strolling the downtown area offers its relaxing charms. From the historic diner to the indie bookstore and art collective, Frostburg is probably the finest destination in Western Maryland for those wanting a slow-paced escape in a natural setting.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]}," \n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Baltimore"]]}," - Approximate travel time three hours.
