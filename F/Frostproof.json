The town's name was coined as a marketing ploy to convince potential homesteaders that the town had never and would never see a frost. This turned out to be untrue, as the town did sustain relatively minor damage during an 1894 frost that destroyed much of Florida's citrus crops. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThe first non-native settlement here was Fort Clinch, which lasted just a few months in 1850. The first permanent settlers arrived in the 1880s. The name of the town was Keystone City, which was later blocked by the postal service because of its similarity to Keystone Heights in northern Florida. The man who worked to apply for a post office settled on the name Lakemont. Another man, who had earlier suggested the name \"Frostproof\", volunteered to deliver the new application to the post office in Fort Meade and changed the name on the application en route.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Forecast"],["Frostproof"],["27.75"],["-81.53"]]},"\n\nFrostproof's climate is much the same as the rest of Central Florida (except coasts). Winters are mild, with highs in the 70s and lows in the 50s. Lows in the 30s are common after cold fronts and there are usually a handful of lows below freezing each winter, although that requires clear skies, so it usually warms very rapidly after sunrise (30 at 6am, 55 by noon is typical). Cold fronts occasionally pass by as squall lines, so tornadoes in December or January are not unusual. Snow is rare; the last measurable snowfall was in 1977, although sleet\/wintry mix fell in an unusually cold January 2010. Summers are hot and humid, with highs around 95 and lows in the mid-70s. During the summer, onshore winds from both coasts travel inland, heat up, rise and build into thunderstorms, usually along a rough line. Lying in the center of the state, the line of storms (the \"seabreezes\") often collide and become severe, with tornadoes (small EF0-1s...not like powerful Plains ones), 50+mph winds, and hail possible. Strong storms are usually preceded by cooler winds caused by the rain-cooled air (cold air sinks) rapidly flowing away from the storm. The temperature after a strong thunderstorm passes can drop from 95 to 75 and since the storms can be fairly small, you can drive 5 miles and the temperature will drop from 95 to 75. \n\nIn 2004, Frostproof was hit by ",{"type":"''","value":["three"]}," hurricanes: Charley, Frances, & Jeanne. It was the first time in recorded U.S. history that 3 hurricanes passed through the same county (Polk County) in the same year, with Lake Wales and other southern Polk County towns lying closest to the path of these hurricanes' eyes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nFrostproof lies at the junction of State Road 17 (Scenic Highway) and County Road 630.
