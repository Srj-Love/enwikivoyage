Furano is famous for its remarkably light and dry powder snow, beautiful fields of lavender, entirely domestic vineyards, and its unique Hokkaido Belly Button Festival\n\nThis guide covers three municipalities in Furano basin: Furano, Nakaurano and Kamifurano.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nFurano is known as ",{"type":"''","value":["Heso no Machi"]}," (the Belly Button Town) due to its central location.  Furano's inland location (almost 100 km -- about as far inland as Japan gets) and high elevation result in a continental climate, the reason behind Furano's successful ski hill and wine industries.  There is a very large temperature variation, so a light jacket is recommended even in the summer.  Summer midday temperatures may exceed 30 degrees C, and midwinters will drop below -30.  Furano has very heavy snowfall in the winter.\n\nThe population is approximately 26,000, including the incorporated communities in the outskirts.  The population of the main municipal area is said to be about 16,000.  Don't expect to meet a large number of English speakers outside of the major hotel and tourist areas.\n\nThere has been a substantial increase in foreign skiers and snowboarders, particularly from Australia, in recent seasons. At least 2,000 Australians are visited Furano in the 06\/07 winter. Furano seems set to enjoy the same skiing success that Niseko has.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nFurano has indirect train service from Sapporo and New Chitose Airport.  All trains require a transfer at Takikawa station.  The last trains leave New Chitose Airport at 8:19PM and Sapporo at 9PM.  In the winter, there is also a Ski Express Train from Sapporo which leaves at 8:04AM, and can also be accessed from the local airport train which leaves New Chitose at 6:53AM.  There are 12 direct trains from Asahikawa, with the last train leaving JR Asahikawa Station at 10:37PM.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Furano Terminal.jpg"],["thumbnail"],["Furano bus terminal"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Chuo Bus"],["url=http:\/\/www.furano.ne.jp\/kankou\/english\/kou\/bus4.html"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=This bus connects ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sapporo"]]}," and Furano."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Lavender Express Bus"],["url=http:\/\/www.furano.ne.jp\/kankou\/english\/kou\/bus1.html"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=This line provides connections from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Biei"]]},", Asahikawa Airport, and JR Asahikawa Station."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=New Chitose Airport Shuttle Bus"],["url=http:\/\/www.furano.ne.jp\/kankou\/english\/ski\/access.html"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Winter."],["price="],["content=This shuttle bus goes directly from the ski slopes to the airport.

The office is located directly across the street from the entrance to JR Furano Station.  Conveniently, their office is shared with the Furano Tourist Association, which can provide advice on how to reach tourist attractions by bus.  Overall, the bus service is poor, with only a few buses each day going to many of the major destinations.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nDue to the lack of effective public transportation, taxi services in Furano are very good.  The largest carrier, Furano Taxi, has a cell-phone interpretation system which can provide service in English, Chinese, and Korean.  Their fleet also contains wheelchair-accessible and other special-needs vehicles.  For a small group, taxi can be quite affordable, with fares to many tourist attractions under 2,000 yen per trip.  There is a 20% fare increase for late night (10pm to 5am) or winter (Nov 25 to Mar 31) services.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nFurano has a high traffic accident rate and one of the highest fatality rates for accidents in Japan.  Rights of way are often confusingly marked on back and rural roads, where locals will often drive in excess of 100 kph.  Driving is not recommended during the peak summer holidays (o-bon or local festival periods) due to the severe traffic congestion.  If you are unfamiliar with winter driving in Japan, do not start here.  A four-wheel drive vehicle is highly recommended.  Many minor roads will be solid ice, and major roads may ice or drift over during the evening and early morning.  The stop lines and center lines will be completely invisible at many intersections — look for the blue signs which designate them.  With that said, Furano has a generally poor public transit system, and many of Furano's unique attractions are best reached by car.  Be careful when drinking — even a sip of wine puts one over the legal driving limit in Japan.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bicycle"]},"\nRental ",{"type":"[[","value":[["cycling"],["cycles"]]}," may be found near the train station.  With the station at your back, several souvenir shops on the left side have bicycles for rent.  They may not offer a helmet (adults in Japan almost never use bicycle helmets) but helmets may be available if you ask.  Many hotels and pensions will also lend out bicycles.  It's safest to stay on sidewalks wherever possible.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["On foot"]},"\nIt's quite possible to explore the small downtown area on foot.  The Kitanomine ski village is also very accessible by foot, although winter conditions can be severe.  Other areas, such as Rokugo, are quite spread out, with several kilometers between points of interest.
