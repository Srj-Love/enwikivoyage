Nearby is the Yongling Tomb where members of the royal household were laid to rest. Both Xing City and Yongling Tomb are now preserved as tourist attractions and are UNESCO world heritage sites.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the area came under first Russian and then Japanese control. Fushun was developed as a major coal mining and heavy industrial area. This city was called 'Coal Capital of China'. Fushun was also the site of China's first non-ferrous metal production plant - Fushun Aluminium Plant. During the 1980's, a significant petrochemical industry was developed. It is now the largest petrochemical  and refined chemical producer in China. With these industries came inevitable pollution. In 2001, the city launched a drive to improve its environment, introducing new equipment into the factories, especially the Aluminium Plant.\n\nLei Feng is little known to the wider world, but in China, he is a household name.
