If a bus is not available, you can always take a taxi or ride a bike. \nLocal public transportation is provided by INFRA FÃ¼rth in conjunction with VAG, see: http:\/\/en.vag.de\/ .  You can buy tickets at electronic ticket machines located at many bus stops, all subway stations, all train stations, and from bus drivers.  Tickets can be purchased with cash, and the ticketing machines do not accept bills larger than â¬20 unless your purchase exceeds â¬30.  Ticket prices are listed on each ticketing machine and at each bus stop.  Depending on your destination, you will need to buy a different ticket that will get you there.  A one way ticket within Fuerth cost â¬1,40.  If you plan on taking more than 2 one-way rides, it will make sense to buy a Day Ticket Solo for â¬3,60 or a Day Ticket Plus for â¬6,30.  The Day Ticket Plus allows up to 2 adults and up to 4 children under the age of 18 to ride within 2 specified zones as much as they want.  This is a good ticket to take when traveling from Fuerth to Nuremberg because Nuremberg downtown is in Zone 2.  There are also discounts for students, children between the ages of 6-14, and senior citizens.  Children 5 and under ride free.

It is estimated that this simple, rather modest church reflecting the image of \"The old Temple on the Hill\" was founded in the year 1100. As early as 601 Pope Gregor declared that the Kircheneinweihung-inauguration of the church should be opened with a cultural feast. And not only recognized as a religious ceremony, historians believe that the foundation of the building occurred approximately 900 years ago, just as the first festival had. The residents of the city of Fürth were very proud and initiated this festival as the Michael und aller Engel Tag to be celebrated on the 29 of September or the Sunday thereafter. The popularity grew as did the area in which it is celebrated, the church of St. Michael, Gustavstraße\/street and in the city of Fürth. In 2010 it is estimated to have had over 1.6 million visitors.
