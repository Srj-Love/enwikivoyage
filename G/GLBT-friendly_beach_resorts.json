[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["TT Banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered-friendly beach resorts"]}," are coastal communities that are welcoming of large numbers of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered (GLBT) travelers and offer amenities and recreation activities that appeal to that demographic.  Destinations that intentionally market to gays and lesbians and those with a long history of gay and lesbian visitors are, in almost all cases, not exclusively gay and actually appeal to wider audiences.  Furthermore, as gays and lesbians are more accepted in many cultures, they are more comfortable vacationing in locales that are not focused on the GLBT market.  It is the case that certain beach destinations attract such a significant number of GLBT visitors that there is a critical mass of gay-focused bars, discos, restaurants and shops.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nEven before gays and lesbians were out to their families, in their communities and at work, there were gay-friendly vacation destinations.

The other hallmarks of these destinations include gay bars and nightclubs, restaurants that cater to gays and lesbians, shops and gyms with large gay clientele, and a cluster of gay guesthouses--often small or medium sized with clothing optional pools.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Destinations"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Africa"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["South Africa"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Cape Town"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Asia"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Indonesia"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Bali"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["Israel"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Tel Aviv"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["Thailand"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Patong"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Phuket"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Europe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["France"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Cannes"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["Greece"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Mykonos"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["Spain"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Gran Canaria"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Ibiza"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Sitges"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["United Kingdom"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Brighton (England)"],["Brighton"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Torquay"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["North America"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Canada"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Vancouver"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["Costa Rica"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Manuel Antonio"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["Mexico"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Canc√∫n"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Puerto Vallarta"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["United States"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Fire Island"],["Fire Island, New York"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Fort Lauderdale"],["Fort Lauderdale, Florida"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Key West"],["Key West, Florida"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Laguna Beach"],["Laguna Beach, California"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Miami Beach"],["Miami Beach, Florida"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Ogunquit"],["Ogunquit, Maine"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Provincetown"],["Provincetown, Massachusetts"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Rehoboth Beach"],["Rehoboth Beach, Delaware"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["San Juan"],["San Juan, Puerto Rico"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Saugatuck-Douglas"],["Saugatuck, Michigan"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Oceania"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Australia"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Cairns"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Gold Coast"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["South America"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Brazil"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Rio de Janeiro"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["Uruguay"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Punta del Este"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["PartOfTopic"],["Concerns"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinetopic"]]}]
