Hikers will usually be able to make it to a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["France#B_.26_B.27s_and_Gites"],["Gite"]]}," or small town every other night, and quite frequently every night. Expected time to complete the trail is around 6-7 weeks, though the majority of people only hike sections of it.\n\nThe trail is fairly well marked with painted marks on rocks, trees, telephone poles, and even houses, walls, and street signs. If you don't see a mark for 100 Meters, you have probably taken a wrong turn, and should head back to the nearest marker.\n\nIt is not realistic to navigate using the markers alone. A trail guide, at minimum, or a topologic map is required.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Hazards "]},"\n\nSunburn is a particular problem, and clothing such as long sleeved shirts and long pants should be worn as they protect from the sun, scratching branches and insects. Sunscreen and a wide-brimmed hat are highly desirable.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Gear "]},"\n\nOne of the advantages of the GR 10 is that it can be hiked with minimal gear, as one can eat dinner and breakfast almost every day at the gites. Additionally the hiker can sleep outside on clear nights and pay for a bed in a gite in inclement weather. On nights that only shelters (which usually have no food or staff) are available, pre-purchased food can be eaten.\n\nIf one plans to eat at gites and buy food from supermarkets that can be eaten without cooking, the absolute minimal gear in the summer months is:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Sleeping Bag\/Sleep Sheet, and a mat for comfort."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Gortex jacket and fleece for cold and\/or wet weather"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Long sleeved shirt and pants"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Short sleeved shirt and shorts (including shorts you can wear swimming)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Sunscreen and wide-brimmed hat"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Adequate footwear.
