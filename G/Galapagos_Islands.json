The islands are therefore very popular amongst natural historians, both professional and amateur. Giant tortoises, sea lions, penguins, marine iguanas and different bird species can all be seen and approached.

Peak season for naturalist tours is typically December through May when the seas are the calmest and the weather the warmest.  However summer months June, July and August are also very popular as the animals are more active.

You may also want to bring a waterproof camera. Remember to wear at least a T-shirt and suntan lotion if you are snorkeling, as it's all too easy to get sunburnt in the strong sun.  Snorkeling offers a way to be in the water with fish, sea turtles, sea lions, and other creatures and is a great option for those who don't have scuba certification.  The islands that are older (further to the west) often have cold temperatures.  Wetsuits can be rented at the same locations as snorkeling equipment.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Diving"]}," in the Galapagos is incredible as noted by Rodale's Scuba Diving Magazine. Darwin and Wolf Islands have been ranked as the best dive destination in the world for several years in the categories of healthiest marine environment, best big animal dive and best advanced diving.  That said, the Galapagos is not necessarily the right place for beginners or novices.  Currents, surge, cold water, and sometimes poor visibility and depths make this a challenge.  Certification courses are available in both Santa Cruz and San Cristobal for those looking to learn, and there are several dive sites that are relatively beginner-friendly.\n\nThere are 2 ways to dive in the Galapagos Islands:\n\n# Daily dives with a local tour operator from Santa Cruz, Isabela and San Cristobal.\n# Galapagos liveaboards. Only liveaboards reach Darwin and Wolf.  These 2 sites are the reason most divers come to Galapagos.\n\nTwo of the world's premier diving destinations, Darwin Island and Wolf Island, are accessible only via live-aboard.  These islands present challenging currents and are not suitable for beginners, but offer amazing opportunities to see huge schools of hammerhead sharks, Galapagos sharks, Silky sharks and whale sharks in season (July-Nov), in addition to other pelagic life like giant mantas, eagle rays, sting rays, huge schools of jack and tuna, sea turtles, sea lions and more.\n\nNote that park regulations may change unexpectedly; in 2007, many divers were caught unaware as the National Park withdrew diving permits from quite a few cruise ships without notice, leaving many divers without dive cruises they had booked far in advance.  For this reason, travelers are advised to get the most up-to-date information possible when planning a dive trip to the Galapagos Islands.  As of 2010, the National Park is now regulating land-based diving for the first time and few of the many shops operating have the new permits necessary.  It is best to ask if an operator has a dive permit, otherwise you may be turned back by Park Rangers and not permitted to dive.  As of 2011, the National Park no longer permits dive liveaboards to offer land visits, except for the Highlands of Santa Cruz which is on all itineraries.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Fishing"]},"\nYou can fish in the Reserve, for marlin, tuna, wahoo and many other species but only if you are using an operator and boat that have the requisite \"",{"type":"'''","value":["Artisanal Vivencial Fishing"]},"\" licences issued by the Galapagos National Park. \"Sport Fishing\", as such, is prohibited.

However, there is constant pressure, both political and commercial, to legalize \"Sport Fishing\" and open the market to better financed and better connected outsiders.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Hiking "]},"\nHiking is often included as part of organized cruises or tours of the highlands.  Although you will often see less animals during these tours, you will often gain a greater understanding of the difference in terrain and vegetation as well as the formation of the islands.

During peak season (Christmas & Easter weeks) as well as during special events all hotels are frequently sold out well in advance.  However, if you are traveling at other times of the year you may be able to find availability by just showing up.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nIn general, crime is not a problem in the Galapagos. Petty crime may occur in the towns, and occasionally fisherman will stage strikes or demonstrations that affect tourists, but for the most part there is little to be concerned about. It should be noted, however, that some items that have been reported missing have been found in the crews' quarters! As most boats do not have lockable cabins, it might be advisable to keep your items locked away in bags in your cabins.\n\nThe animal life in the islands is mostly docile with the exception of larger sea lions. Bulls, in particular, will vigorously protect their harems, and can inflict dangerous and potentially deadly bites. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Do not snorkel close to sea lion colonies"]},". If a bull sea lion approaches you, swim away from the nearest colony. While the bulls can be dangerous; swimming with juvenile sea lions can be one of the most exciting parts of a trip.\n\nIn addition to sea lions, there is a minimal danger from sharks. In general sharks will not attack unless provoked, although attacks can sometimes occur in murky water when sharks mistake humans for other animals. However, by exercising simple common sense experiences will be almost always be positive.\n\nBe careful with the tap water, especially in Puerto Ayora. It is not recommended to drink it or brush your teeth with it.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Respect"]},"\n\nThe park is strictly regulated. Outside of the towns visitors must be accompanied by guides, and visitors are only allowed on land from sunrise until sunset. Itineraries must be registered with the park prior to embarking on a trip, and animals should never be disturbed; while the wildlife in the Galapagos will usually ignore your presence, a general rule of thumb is that if an animal notices your presence then you are too close. Two meters is generally given as a minimum distance to keep away from animals; you will find that if you are calm and respectful that many animals will walk right up to investigate you.\n\nOne of the greatest dangers to the islands is introduced species. The park service is trying to eliminate goats, rats, cats, dogs, and introduced plant species on many of the islands, but it is a difficult battle; after evolving for thousands of years without predators, the Galapagos wildlife is not adapted to handle these new species. When traveling to the islands, do not bring any plant or animal life with you, and be sure to always clean your footwear when traveling between islands to avoid accidentally transferring seeds.\n\nIllegal fishing is another threat to the park. Although park officials may deny it, illegal fishing for sharks and sea cucumbers occurs on a massive scale. The number of fishermen has increased rapidly over the last few years, while the number of fish have plunged.  Due to ongoing tensions between fisherman, tourism, and science the level of enforcement of fishing laws can vary greatly, but even when policies are put in place to limit fishing enforcement is difficult due to the resources required to patrol the vast park area.\n\nAnother big threat to the park is the growing population. Although new rules make it impossible for people arriving from the mainland to live and work on the islands, the rules are hardly enforced, resulting in many people immigrating from the mainland to make quick money on the islands.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Rules"]},"\n\nThe codified park rules are:\n\n# To visit the National park you must always be accompanied by a certified Galapagos National park guide.\n# Galapagos is a unique and fragile environment.

Professional shooting needs authorization from the National Park.\n# Please stay within the limits of the walking trails, for your safety and that of the flora and fauna.\n# To avoid affecting the wildlife's natural behavior please avoid getting closer than two meters to the animals.\n# Camping is only allowed in specific sites.  If you wish to camp, you must first obtain a permit from the Galapagos National Park.\n# Help conservation by cooperating with the authorities in their inspection, monitoring and control duties.
