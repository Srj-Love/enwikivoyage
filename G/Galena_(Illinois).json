It is known as \"The City that Time Forgot\" for its rich 19th century heritage. Named after the local lead deposits, the city was founded in 1826 and was a major port on the Mississippi River. Its fortunes changed in the 20th century as demand for lead dropped, but in the 1980s, the city reinvented itself as a tourist destination. Today, 3,600 residents form a community that is rich in history, claiming the home of the 18th President of the United States, Ulysses S. Grant. More than a thousand buildings in Galena are listed in the National Register of Historic Places by the U. S. Department of the Interior. Many of the elegantly restored homes are now bed & breakfasts or open to the public for tours.
