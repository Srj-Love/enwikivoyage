At one point, two rival town sites (Empire City north of Short Creek and Galena south of the creek) were operated by rival mining companies. By 1904 there were over thirty mining companies; local population at the peak of the mining boom was between 10000-30000 people.\n\nIn 1897 three members of the Staffleback family, which operated a house of ill repute on Owl Creek on the west side of Galena, were imprisoned for robbing and murdering miner Frank Galbreath; his body had been found dumped into an abandoned mine shaft. Other murders on the property were long alleged but never proven. The case drew instant notoriety and parallels were drawn to the \"Bloody Benders\", a family of dishonest innkeepers 66 miles (110km) further west (in Cherryvale KS) who robbed and murdered travellers from 1871-1873. In 2012, an Arkansas-based paranormal group claimed an abandoned Victorian house at 206 N. Main Street to be the \"Galena Murder Bordello\" in an effort to restore the building and sell tours of a haunted house; their claims were debunked by the local historical society. The murders had been widely covered by newspapers at the time; as the original wooden structure on Owl Creek had been burned to the ground in 1897 by a mob of forty vigilantes with torches and kerosene, nothing remained.\n\nIn 1910, African-American resident William Boston was arrested for killing Benjamin Jones of the Windle & Burr livery stable in a clumsily-executed robbery; as a 200-strong lynch mob was forming in front of the local jail, Galena police chief John Fitzgerald swiftly loaded the handcuffed prisoner into a motorcar at the back of the jail, which quickly departed to the county jail at Columbus. The mob left empty-handed.\n\nIn 1926, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Route 66"]]}," came to town, initially crossing into Kansas from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Joplin"]]},", Missouri on 7th Street. The route was moved slightly further south (onto the modern K-66 routing) in the early 1970s.\n\nIn 1935, the International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers (CIO) went on strike in the Tri-State Lead and Zinc District; the mine owners attempted to break the strike by forcing workers to leave the CIO-backed union and join a bogus \"Blue Card Union\", controlled by the company. Thousands of workers refused and were sacked. Violent confrontations took place between the two rival groups of workers in 1935 and again in 1937; at one point Route 66 traffic was shut down and the Kansas National Guard called in. Eventually the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ordered the employers to stop encouraging membership in a company union, but the damage was done.\n\nLead and zinc mined in the region (Joplin MO to Galena KS to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Miami (Oklahoma)#Picher"],["Picher"]]}," OK) were vital to the war effort in two world wars. By the 1950s, the mineral deposits were depleted and mining companies began to close. Abandoned factories which once belonged to the Eagle-Picher mining company are still visible on the road from Joplin into Galena, but the town is a shadow of its former self.\n\nRoute 66 was bypassed by Interstate 44, which does not enter the state, instead running from Missouri directly into Oklahoma.
