[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Gallipolis"]}," is a village in Gallia County, in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southeast Ohio"]]},". It is just across the Ohio River from Point Pleasant, West Virginia. The word Gallipolis is from the French for \"city of the Gauls\" because it was originally settled by a group of French pioneers known as the French 500. Most of the French 500 died within a couple years due to their lack of preparedness for life on the frontier, but the city has endured. \n\nOne of the historic landmarks in Gallipolis is the Our House Tavern, a museum that was formerly an inn where the French Commander Lafayette stayed during the Revolutionary War. The tavern is said to be haunted, with many reported sightings of ghosts dressed in colonial garb.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=US 35.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["directionl1=W"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chillicothe (Ohio)"],["Chillicothe"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jackson (Ohio)"],["Jackson"]]}],["directionr1=E"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Charleston (West Virginia)"],["Charleston"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Point Pleasant (West Virginia)"],["Point Pleasant"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Gallipolis, Ohio"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["38.815278"],["-82.197500"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Southeast Ohio"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North_America\/United_States\/Ohio\/Localities\/G\/Gallipolis\/"]]}]
