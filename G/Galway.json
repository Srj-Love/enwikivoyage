It's a small town compared to Dublin, and it luckily doesn't have to deal with most of the problems big cities have.\n\nWith that said, it is a party town and the weekends can get pretty crazy. Keep your wits about you, and stay in groups if you don't know the area. Despite Galway's reputation as a safe place, like everywhere Galway has a troublesome element so do bear that in mind.\n\nLike most towns in Ireland, there are some run down areas. For its size, Galway does not have many but there are still some suburbs that are better avoided by anyone unfamiliar. These areas are all off the beaten track of the tourist areas.\n\nThe River Corrib runs through Galway. It is a very powerful river, especially after a few days of rain, and drowning deaths do occur. Use caution when walking on the river banks and walkways, especially after a night of drinking.\n\nNimmo's Hostel, has had a reputation for being unsafe, but its door is locked, and can only be entered using a regularly updated code. Despite its former reputation, it is a safe, if 'colourful' place to stay.\n\nStay away from the public toilet areas in Eyre Square late at night, it attracts a lot of drunks.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nGalway is the ideal base for trips throughout western Ireland.

English is also spoken in these towns if you are not confident enough to speak Irish just yet, but as a visitor you can appreciate hearing the Irish language being spoken in one of the few areas where it is a thriving first spoken language and has priority over English\n\nSeveral outlets around town and at the tourist office sell ferry tickets to the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Aran Islands"]]}]},".\n\nFor hitch hikers hoping to see the rest of Connacht, the best place to catch rides is near the Galway Shopping Centre, north of the city centre.
