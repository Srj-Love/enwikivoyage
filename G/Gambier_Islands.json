The pension operators know very basic English - with a bit of French, you can get by.  If there is an emergency speak to Monica the mayor\/police officer, and she help you find an English speaker.  John who lives on Kamaka is fluent, as is his son who lives in town.  Remember to say \"",{"type":"'''","value":["merci"]},"\" and \"",{"type":"'''","value":["nana"]},"\" after someone has helped you.

Arrange with your pension to be picked up at the dock (after taking the ferry from the airport on the motu). The island's 16 mile circle road can be walked in 4-6 hours. It's a great walk. If you wish to see one of the other islands in the group, ask your pension about day trips. Pension Moroi offers a great day trip to see several other islands.

Snorkling is quite good, if only there was a dive operation.  Watching the stars at night.

You can also eat at the pensions (let them know ahead of time as they only prepare enough food for those they know are coming for dinner). Food at the pensions is simple, tasty, and plentiful and you will not go hungry. The hospitality is heartwarming.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nDespite the legacy of French nuclear testing at nearby Muraroa atoll, the water is safe to drink, and bottled water is available from small shops in town.  Many of the locals, the soils, and groundwater have been tested for residual radiation by the French government and Greenpeace.  All results were negative for radionucleotides.  There are no surface streams or wells, and all potable water is collected by catchment from roofs, and thus quite safe to drink.\n\nIn Rikitea there are two small markets.  One has a decent selection of alcohol, but you will pay dearly for anything but beer.  A bottle of Absolut Vodka was priced at nearly USD100.  If you wish to have anything specific for you trip you'd better bring it with you to save money, as prices even in Papeete are high.\n\nAt night the pensions and small restaurants in Rikitea serve beer (Hirono).  Prices are high, but reasonable given the remoteness of the islands.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nThe locals are friendly and a delight.  Wear lots of suncreen, and be careful of stonefish.  Bug spray is recommended. Europeans, and to an increasing degree North Americans, are less modest than Polynesians.
