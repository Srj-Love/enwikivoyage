Later a harbour was built around the fountain and a (now abolished) whaling station was erected in De Kelders, just outside of town. Gansbaai is a quaint little fishing village that bloomed into the Great White Capital of the World. The bountiful landscapes and oceans around gives way to a multitude of outdoor activities and spectacular views to behold. Also, who can forget the two celebrities that lend Gansbaai the name Big 2 Town, the graceful Southern Right Whales and the famous Great White Sharks.\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/gansbaai.news.com  Gansbaai News"]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Tourism Office"],["url=http:\/\/www.danger-point-peninsula.co.za"],["email="],["address=middle of Main St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+27 (0)72 291-5564 or +27 (0)82 626-9037"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=M-F 9AM-1PM & 2PM-5PM, Sa 9AM-2PM"],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nFrom ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cape Town"]]},", follow the ",{"type":"'''","value":["N2"]}," in the direction of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hermanus"]]}," then take the ",{"type":"'''","value":["R43"]}," turnoff and follow that route until you come reach Gansbaai, about two hours driving time.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["Trivia"],["The coast off Gansbaai is rumored to be the favorite hang-out of the ghost ship ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Flying Dutchman"]},".

Just a mile offshore is the Birkenhead Rock, place of doom of the HMS Birkenhead which wrecked in clear view of the coast with the loss of many lives of young English soldiers on their way to fight the Zulus.\n\nThe hinterland of Danger-Point-Peninsula is a mosaic of different habitats of the remarkable Cape Floral Kingdom (\"fynbos\"), ancient indigenous forest, agricultural lands, vineyards, flower-farms and rural communities. Many of these places can be visited. Experienced guides are available to take you to the highest mountain peaks or the deepest riverine gorges. Though there are many nature parks and reserves in the greater area, several animals, among which 6 antelope species, roam freely and the abundance of different bird species is due to a plethora of different landscapes.\n\nThe small seaside village of Franskraal has one of the quaintest museums in the country. An original \"Strandveld-house\" immediately on the sea harbors a special collection about the history of the area.\n\nBaardskeerdersbos can easily be missed when passing this rural hamlet on the road from Gansbaai to Elim; it has only a small number of houses. It has however a magnificent position in the Boesmansriver-valley nestled in between fynbos-clad hills.\n\nThe neighboring village of Elim is an old Moravian mission station, established to function as a refuge for Khoi-people (the indigenous inhabitants of the Western Cape) in the 18th century. Visiting Elim is almost a time travel to the 19th century.
