An itinerary describes the route of the journey or tour or the proposed outline of one.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Money"]},"\nIf you're traveling to one area, check the cost of living there.

Often gap year travelers want to support their journey by taking work, often of a low-skilled and\/or intermittent nature. Unfortunately, working in other countries often requires a work visa. Typically these are onerous for gap year travelers: you need to find an employer to apply for the visa, the visa is expensive, and the employer must show that they cannot hire someone with your skills locally. The work visa will be tied to your term at that employer. However, there are some visa schemes and work schemes that cater specifically to those who are looking for a job to support their travel.\n\nIf you are a citizen of certain countries, you can work in some other countries without needing a visa at all:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" citizens of a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["European Union"]]}," country can work in other EU countries without a visa"]},{"type":"*","value":[" citizens of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Australia"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Zealand"]]}," can each work in the other country without a visa"]},"\nGap year travelers who are under 30 should look into visa arrangements where you can go to a country for a certain period of time, often 12 months and sometimes up to 24, and work intermittently. The intention of the visa is that you work to fund your trip, and there will typically be restrictions on your working including: not working for more than a certain amount of time during the visa period, not working for any one employer for a long period, working only in specified industries and sometimes not working in jobs that further your career path.\n\nThese are typically reciprocal arrangements: your country will offer visas of this sort to citizens of certain other countries and those other countries will do the same for you. Hence it is best to check with your own country's foreign affairs officials to see if you have reciprocal visas, and if so, with which countries.\n\nSee ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Working abroad"]]}," for suggested employers and industries, and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Teaching English"]]}," for one type of job and see ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Volunteer"]]}," for volunteer opportunities.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Learn "]},"\n\nAn increasingly more popular option for those planning a gap-year is to ",{"type":"'''","value":["travel and learn"]},". This is especially popular with school leavers, allowing them to take a year out before university, without compromising their education. In many cases, enrolling on a gap-year course abroad can actually improve your chances of moving into higher education back in your home country.\nTypically there will be a tuition fee to enrol on these educational programs. There are two reasons for this: firstly, many of these courses are run by private institutions, and secondly, because international students rarely attract government funding.\n\nThere are a number of organisations offering gap year educational programmes.

The first thing to realize when considering a long trip is that travel can be hard work. A trip isn't the same as a vacation and can often be more taxing than the work or school that you're leaving behind. A long trip can involve dozens of new places or an extended stay in just one or two. In either case there will be the daily challenges of functioning in a new environment. Things as simple as buying a bus ticket or fresh vegetables at the grocery store need to be relearned - often again and again.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Before you go"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Talk to other people"]}," who have done a trip similar to the one you are planning.

This might seem counterintuitive, but it's true  you can afford to lug a heavy bag around for a week or two, but do you want to have anything extra for a year? Stick to the absolute basics and know what you can and cannot buy at your destination(s). There's no point in bringing 6 months of toothpaste to Europe or buying a sarong at home to take to the tropics. If you are visiting several climates, try to arrange it so you visit the warmer places first and coldest last. That way you can purchase sweaters and long pants and not have to carry them any more than needed. Alternately, visit cold climates first and then ship unneeded layers home — or sell them off. A good rule of thumb is to bring one outfit for the hottest day you're likely to encounter, one for an average day, and one for the coldest.

It's easy to get into a rut on a long trip - always the same sort of hotel, always the same mode of transportation and soon every place starts to look the same. If you're an independent traveler, try taking a guided tour - you'll make friends and find out new things about the places you're exploring. If you're usually a tour groupie, strike out on your own for a day or two and find adventures off the beaten path. Many travelers buy one guidebook before they leave and stick to it like a holy book. Think about trading guidebooks with a fellow traveler for a day (or forever). One night spending a little more or a little less on hotels, restaurants, and transportation can show you a whole new side to a city.
