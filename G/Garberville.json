It is, however, ideally located for travelers who wish to explore the Humboldt Redwoods without camping in the wilderness.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nGarberville lies only about 3 miles south of the entrance to the Avenue of the Giants, a 30 mile long stretch of scenic highway featuring several of the tallest trees on the planet. Many of the biggest and best groves of redwoods can be seen on short loop hikes, no longer than 1.5 miles. It is therefore very easy to venture out in the morning from Garberville, drive the Avenue in its entirety, take several hikes at a leisurely pace, and be back in town before sundown.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\nThe Garberville-Redway Chamber of Commerce is located at 773 Redwood Drive, just a short walk down the street from the Best Western. There are a number of shops there where one can buy, among other things, souvenirs such as shot glasses or t-shirts.\n\nThere are also three gas stations located on Garberville's main strip.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nOne block down Redwood Dr. from the Best Western is a restaurant called Cecil's.
