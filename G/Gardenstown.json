It has rows of prettily-painted traditional fishermen's cottages, a beach and is one of the most beautiful villages in Scotland. It has a nice old-fashioned family feel to it, with its own butcher and bakers (not a candlestick maker although there used to be a candle-maker).\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Gardenstown and St John's Kirk - geograph.org.uk - 434571.jpg"],["thumb"],["350px"],["Gardenstown and St John's Kirk"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nFrom the south - Follow M90 to Perth, then take the A90 Dundee road and follow this up to Aberdeen.\n\nFor coastal route - as soon as you reach Aberdeen, follow road signs for A90 for around 18 miles, then turn off on the A952 to Fraserburgh.
