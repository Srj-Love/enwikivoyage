The area was fist occupied in the 3rd millennium BC along easily defensible terrain at one of the bends of the Azat River.  In the 8th century BC the area was conquered by the Urartian King Argishti I.  The fortification at Garni was erected probably sometime in the 3rd century BC as a summer residence for the Armenian Orontid and Artaxiad royal dynasties. Later around the 1st century BC the fortress of Garni became the last refuge of King Mithridates of Armenia, where he and his family were assassinated by his son in law and nephew Rhadamistus.  The fortress was eventually sacked in 1386 by Timur Lenk. In 1679 an earthquake devestated the area destroying the temple.\n\nMuch of the population today descends from people settled in the population exchange of 1829–1830, following the Treaty of Turkmenchay between Russia and Persia.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\n\nTaxis are the quickest way to get to and from Garni.

They leave from Yerevan typically every 30 minutes or until they have reached their full capacity, cost 250 AMD.  From the centre takes buses 22, 26, 36 or marshrutkas 9, 69, 73 to a large Mercedes-Benz showroom: in a side street just before the showroom the marshrutkas for Garni leave.  Stops are made at the villages of Garni, Goght and Geghard.  Drivers wait 15-20 minutes at Goght after dropping off all of the passengers, then head back to Yerevan making stops along the way and at Garni to pick up more passengers.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By tourbus"]},"\n\nVarious tourbuses may be arranged ahead of time in Yerevan.
