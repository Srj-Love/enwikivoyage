It is a gateway to the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Great Smoky Mountains National Park"]]},".  Downtown Gatlinburg may come as somewhat of a shock for those on their way to a nature getaway in the national park - from the Space Needle to the amusement rides, the town hasn't necessarily chosen to embrace its \"nature\" side.  That said, there is plenty of lodging, restaurants, and other amenities to make this town a useful base for exploring the park.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nThe town's development is closely tied to that of the national park, which was opened in 1934.  While in 1912 the town had only six houses, by 1935 over 500,000 visitors were passing through the town each year, and today over 9 million people each year visit the park.  The town grew quickly to accommodate the influx, but has had to deal with issues of urban sprawl and air quality as a result of the huge numbers of outsiders that pass through.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]}," \nGatlinburg is best reached by the north by taking I-40 to TN 66 SOUTH.

It is about 35 miles from Cherokee to Gatlinburg, but the high volume of tourist traffic on the road can make the trip at least an hour long.\n\nFrom the east US 321 brings in traffic directly from I-40 coming in from North Carolina.\n\nGatlinburg is a very popular resort town, which can be a nightmare for drivers during the peak summer months, especially on weekends. If you are headed to the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Great Smoky Mountains National Park"]]}," it is best to use the Gatlinburg By-Pass to avoid the traffic delays.

There are several park-and-ride locations:  the Gatlinburg Visitor Center has free parking and access to the purple route; the Gatlingburg Mass Transit Center (located behind the Ripley's Aquarium) offers pay parking and access to all trolley routes.  The Gatlinburg By-Pass allows traffic heading into the National Park from the north to bypass the Gatlinburg business district.
