As they were not Egyptian citizens they were not allowed into Egypt, either.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nGaza has been around for a while: the earliest known reference is an inscription in the Temple of Amun at Karnak, Egypt, dated 1500 BC, which states that the town of Gaza is 'flourishing'. And for a long time it did: a staging post on trade routes connecting Asia and Persia with Arabia, Egypt and Africa, even the name means \"treasure\" in Arabic.  Alexander the Great laid siege to the town in 332 BC, executing 10,000 defenders after being held off for two months. Later, the town was held by the Romans, the Crusaders, the Mamluks, the Ottomans and briefly even by the French in 1799, when Napoleon Bonaparte set up camp on his way to defeat in Egypt. The Turks took it back, then lost it to the British in World War I. The Egyptian army grabbed it during the 1948 war that led to Israel's independence, opening camps for Palestinian refugees - and the current situation began when Israel occupied the Strip in 1967.\n\nSpurred by the violence of the 1987-1993 ",{"type":"'''","value":["Intifada"]}," (\"Uprising\"), Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization signed a \"Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements\" in 1993, under which the Palestinian Authority (PA) was created to govern the Gaza Strip and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["West Bank"]]}," for a transitional period \"not exceeding five years\" as a step towards full independence.

The Islamist ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hamas"]}," won elections in 2006 and violently kicked out the remnants of the Palestinian Authority in 2007.  Under Hamas rule, there have been repeated incidents of missile launches from Gaza into Israel and Israeli targeted assassinations of militants in Gaza, bombings, and incursions or invasions of Gaza. Israel has also heavily restricted the movement of trade, aid, and people between Gaza and Israel in response to attacks on border crossing points and the Hamas government's non-recognition of Israel. Relations between Hamas and the Egyptian government have also been tense at times, with the Egyptian government sometimes blaming Hamas for attacks on Egyptian security forces and civilians in the Sinai but also condemning Israeli actions against Gaza. From December 2008 to January 2009, Israel launched a massive coordinated air, naval, and land offensive against the Hamas government and allied militant organizations. Hostilities resumed in 2012, but a short-lived ceasefire was restored with the help of Egyptian mediation.\n\nAs of 2014, Hamas has been launching rockets from Gaza as far as 160km (100 miles) into Israeli territory; Israel has counterattacked, causing civilian casualties. Western governments are advising their citizens to leave the region.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Geography"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:gz-map.png"],["frame"],["Gaza Strip"]]},"\n\nThe Gaza Strip is a narrow, 40-km long slice of land between the Mediterranean to the west and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Negev"]]}," desert to the east.

The urban sprawl of Gaza City, mostly stretching along and around the 3-km long Omar al-Mukhtar Street, covers much of the north. The other main towns of Khan Yunis and Rafah are near the southern border, with most of the rest covered with agricultural land.\n\nA bit of terminology disentanglement: ",{"type":"'''","value":["Gaza Strip"]}," refers to the entire 40-by-6 kilometer patch of territory.  ",{"type":"'''","value":["Gaza City"]}," refers to the town itself, in the northern part of the strip, but due to huge population growth the City now sprawls into many of the surrounding villages and it's a tough task to say what is a part of the City and what isn't.

In fact, as of around 2003, all would-be visitors were required to apply in advance for Israeli permission to enter the Strip. The application is usually submitted through your embassy in Israel and, in theory takes between 5–10 days. In practice, it can take months, and if you're not either a fully accredited journalist or an aid\/human rights worker, you're unlikely to get permission to enter Gaza from Israel.\n\nIt is possible to enter Gaza from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Egypt"]]}," through the Rafah crossing. The crossing was reopened for traffic on June 1, 2010 though some restrictions still apply and only large groups on NGO sponsored trips will be admitted. Egyptian authorities control only their side of the crossing with Hamas police operating the other side. However, Palestinians (except for men between 18 and 40) are permitted to cross into Egypt visa-free. Reports exist of Hamas police asking for bribes of up to $5,000 to allow people, including Palestinians, out of Gaza.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nGaza has no functioning airport, as the former Yasser Arafat International Airport (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["GZA"]]},") has been shut down since 2000. The airport was badly damaged by multiple bombings - the most recent in 2009 - and is unlikely to reopen in the foreseeable future. The Israeli Air Force monitors Gazan airspace with radar, and regularly sends patrols of drone aircraft and fighter jets over Gaza. A surveillance balloon is also tethered at the Erez Crossing.

You will need a permit from the Israeli Army, or a GPO (press) card.\n\nIf you have a permit, you need coordination with the Israeli Army, specifying when you are planning to enter and leave Gaza. Journalists with a Government Press Office (GPO) card can come and go as they please. Only vehicles with prior coordination (such as a handful of UN cars) are allowed to drive in and only after a thorough search, which may take months.\n\nIt's very helpful to travel with someone that's run the gauntlet before the first time via Erez.\n\nAt Erez, you have to approach the Israeli soldier in a pillbox. They may ask you to open your bags on the table, and (as at TLV) ask if you have weapons. They'll check your passports and permits for allowed entry. You then wait outside an electronic gate for your turn to be called through. You then enter the terminal, hand your passport and coordination over to another soldier to receive an Israeli exit stamp. who may or may not ask you more questions—usually things like \"first time in Gaza\", etc. \n\nIf everything is satisfactory, take back your documents and follow the signs directing you to Gaza. After exiting the terminal, you end up in a long barren concrete tunnel. Don't bring anything too bulky as you'll have to go through a turnstile gate. Coming through the tunnel, you cross a no-man's-land. This is at least 1000m long, and has lovely views of desolate, and presumably mined, land. Palestinians* are allowed in this area so you may be lucky and find a porter, trolley, wheelchair, or similar. Take it. If you take the tuk-tuk, keep your hands inside the vehicle at all times and enjoy the ride. The driver will be very friendly—not everyone in Gaza wants to shoot or kidnap you!\n\nAfter the gated tunnel you will emerge near a small hut. This is a checkpoint which can be ignored on the way to Gaza (but ignored at your peril on the way back). Since 2012, the only people here will be a few taxi drivers.\n\nTake a taxi to the Hamas checkpoint, another 800m down the road. The going rate is 3 shekels per person. You will be searched for unlawful items (make sure you are, it's the hut to the right. Also visit the hut to the left to check your Hamas credentials—new since October 2011)\n\nProhibited goods include alcohol and non-halal food, banned by the Hamas government. If you fail inspection, then at best, your items will be confiscated. At worst, you will be arrested; you are unlikely to see any guns at this point. In a particularly bad situation, retreat to Israel.\n\nOnce you are through, you can take another taxi, or more likely be picked up by your local contact. \n\nAnother way in is through the Rafah Crossing in the South, on the border with Egypt. Egyptian authorities have built a wall on it, and the only way in is through a road called the Philadelphi Route. The route is controlled by Hamas, and the point of entry and exit is controlled by Egyptian Police. You will need to bring a passport with you, as the Egyptian authorities generally do not let anyone out of the Strip into Egypt, and even getting in may pose a challenge. You may also be stopped by Hamas patrols once you enter.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Exit by land"]},"\n\nEntry, though difficult, pales in comparison to exit. After being deposited at the Hamas checkpoint near Hamsa Hamsa, go to the white caravan to your right to get your exit clearance.\n\nOnce through, take the taxi (3 shekels\/person) to the forward checkpoint (where the wire fence begins). Then, go to the hut on the right.\nA man will take your passport and call ahead to tell the Israelis you're coming. Ignore this at your own peril. \n\nOnce you get your passport back, take the tuk-tuk if possible, or begin the 1 km+ walk to Israel.\n\nWhen you reach the end of the tunnel, you'll see several doors. Once a handful of people have gathered, one of the doors will open (indicated by a green light on top of the door).\n\nYou will then enter a hall with a table at the centre. Open your bags at the table (there are no obvious signs to do this, but look up and there's a camera. They are checking for obvious things like large bombs) \n\nWhen they've ensured you have no prohibited items in your bags, go through the turnstile when the light flashes green. You will not receive a verbal \"OK\", but rest assured you will be shouted at in Hebrew if you're not ok.\n\nYou will see toilet facilities to your right. Use them. Follow the arrows to Israel. You will then encounter another hall with eight doorways. Wait until one of the lights go green then enter that doorway. Leave your bags with the porter at a large security scanner. You should remove all electronics not just laptops, but things like disk drives, mobile phones, etc.) and place them in the large trays. Remove your belt, watch, etc. too.\n\nKeep your passport and ID on you and enter a series of gates as the lights flash green. When you come to the body scanner (a MMW scanner), put your feet on the markers and place your hands over your head in an \"I surrender\" pose. Keep your passport in your hands. If you've passed initial screening, you will be allowed out to a hall where it appears as if your bags will emerge on a conveyor belt. There may even be empty trays circling it.\n\nWalk straight through to the departures hall, as your bag will be selected for a hand search. On your left in a row where trays with bags will gather, and you can see the guards searching your bags. Wait paitently. If you haven't passed initial screening, you'll be directed through further scanning. There is a separate section that will reveal itself to you if the guards in the gallery above find the need for a strip search.\n\nOnce you collect your belongings, you will finally pass through Israeli entry, and get a new stamp in your passport. You're then free and in Israel. Count yourself lucky you own a western passport.\n\nExit from Gaza could take from 30 minutes to several hours. The checkpoint closes at 14:00, or even earlier. If you are stuck between Hamas and Israel phone your embassy for assistance, but don't try to re-enter Gaza.
