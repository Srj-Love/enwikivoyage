The snowbelt can get pounded with a foot or more of snow, while 20 miles to the south they get nothing. In the snowbelt they're used to the snow, so large snowfalls that cause towns in other places to shut down are normal in Geauga County, and business often continues as usual. Be careful driving in winter, especially if you're not from an area that sees much snow, as the weather can change quickly.\n\nAdditionally when driving in Geauga County, keep on the lookout for deer, farm equipment, and Amish buggies. Accidents involving buggies can be fatal, so watch out.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cleveland"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" Geauga Lake"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Greater Cleveland"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["41.5"],["-81.17"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Geauga County, Ohio"]]}]
