It is rich in Tasmania's forestry history and only a short drive away from the Hartz Mountains National Park. Once called Light Wood Bottom, Geeveston was named after William Geeves, a preacher who was granted land in 1842. The name was changed to Geeveston in 1851.\n\nCurrently, Geeveston is a small, thriving town with a bank, post office, accommodation, launderette and shops. It is also the last stop for supplies and petrol before entering the Southern Forest (where the Tahune airwalk is located). The town only has one (non-bank) ATM located in the IGA store which will incur a usage charge, so it may be best to withdraw money before arriving.\n\nTake a walk around 'Tasmania's Forest Town' and keep an eye out for the increasing number of wooden sculptures of prominent local figures.\n\nThe road between Huonville, Geeveston and the Southern Forest is filled with houses and farms who grow their own produce and is a great place to buy cheap apples, cherries, pears, nectarines, woodwork and plants.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nGeeveston is a 55 km drive from Hobart along the A6.
