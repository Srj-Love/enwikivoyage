With over 30,000 inhabitants, it is part of the municipality of Sittard-Geleen. Until the end of the 19th century, Geleen was a small village. The remains of one of the oldest prehistoric farms in the Netherlands were found here. In the 20th century the exploitation of coal mines in this area brought a fast population increase. During the 1960s and 1970s all Dutch coalmines, that were all located in this part of this province, were closed. The State mining company DSM (privatised in 1989) however remained active in Geleen, now purely as a chemicals producer.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=VVV tourist information point"],["url=http:\/\/www.vvvzuidlimburg.nl"],["email="],["address=Raadhuisstraat 15"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+31 900 5559798"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nGeleen is located near two highways, the A2 and the A76, which makes the city easily accessible by car.  \nThe city is served by two train stations, served by regional trains.
