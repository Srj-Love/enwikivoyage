It is the location of one of the colleges in the State University of New York. In the 1960's its campus began to be too big. When the drinking age was lowered to 18, the market for bars ruined Main Street. The college is now very selective, and the village has been registered as an historic landmark, because the village values highly its rural heritage. A mile or two away is a WWII aircraft museum, with dirt airfield and yearly air show. Six miles away is Letchworth State Park, with planted trees now quite tall.
