Germanic tribes who followed the Celts were driven out of the area by the Romans who settled Gengenbach from 73 AD until 260 AD. To this day remnants of the Roman era include a richly decorated votive column, coins, and a brick oven opened to the public in 1974. The most important Roman road from Strasbourg to Rottweil passed through Gengenbach and the town was declared a Free City by the Romans.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nPeople know how to enjoy life where wine is grown and Gengenbach has been no exception for ages.
