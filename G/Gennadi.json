Basically a continuation of Kiotari, Gennadi combines two different characters: on the one hand there’s the vast beach where there’s always room for you and your friends to spread out your beach towels - only parts of the beach are commercially organized - while on the other there are the Sunday parties with guests DJ's at the new Sundance beach bar, which opened last year and has transformed the character of the beach, attracting all the hip young people from around the island. The beach is separated from the village, which lies above the main road, but along the road you'll find tavernas, rooms to rent, small hotels and the villas of wealthy local people.    \n\nA place rich in nature beauty! \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Ekaterini Hotel"],["url=http:\/\/www.ekaterini-hotel.com"],["email=info@ekaterini-hotel.com"],["address=Kiotari-Asklipiio"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+30 2244 047131"],["tollfree="],["fax=+30 2244 047048"],["hours="],["price=Double €40-100"],["checkin=24 hr"],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["36.024000"],["27.908333"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Rhodes"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Gennadi"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Gennadi"]]}]
