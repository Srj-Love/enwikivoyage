May 23, 1928 President Coolidge signed a resolution starting the George Rogers Clark Commission to create a monument to celebrate Clark. June 14, 1936, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt dedicated the memorial. In 1966 it became part of the National Park Service. \n\nThe memorial itself stands more than 80 feet high and 90 feet across at its base. The walls are two thick wide, made of granite from Vermont, Minnesota and Alabama. 16 Doric columns go around the building with inscriptions celebrating the life of Clark. \n\nInside the memorial are seven murals painted by Ezra Winter at 16x28 feet. The murals depict Clark's remarkable 18-day journey and the events that it entailed. In the middle is a bronze sculpture of Clark by Hermon Atkins, standing over 7 feet tall. Quotes and dates are placed in and out of the building on the walls, discussing the life and death and accomplishments of Clark. He was only 25 years old when these events took place, immortalizing him. \n\nGeorge Rogers Clark captured Fort Sackville from British Lt. Governor Henry Hamilton on Feb. 25, 1779, this is considered one fo the most important moments of the American Revolution, leading to Clark's march on the Mississippi River, solidifying America's future in the Northwest.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\nBeautiful green park, reminiscent of the National Parks of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Washington, D.C."]]}," Located right along the banks of the Wabash River, you can take path down to the water itself to observe the natural settings.
