Fares should never be more than G$500 for travel within the city and most fares should be around G$400, regardless of the number of people. All taxis licence plates begin with 'H.' There are set prices for taxis for different destinations, e.g. from the airport to town costs GD$5000, from the airport to Molson Creek is GD$24000, etc. It is wise to ask at your hotel to recommend a driver.

If your visit to this village is perceived to be anything other than casual then there could be unwarranted problems. There are a lot of gangs and drug dealers there. Many Indo-Guyanese villages such as Cane Grove, Annadale, and lusignan, are notorious for violence, petty crimes, racism and kidnappings. It is advisable for toursists or people who are not of Indo-Guyanese origin travelling through these areas should also be accompanied by someone known in these areas.\n\nThe police response varies depending on the location and time of the crime. Some tourists have reported positive responses.\n\nDiscussions of the current affairs of ethnic relations between the two major races, politics and the socio-economic issues in the country ought to be undertaken with much tact and much patience. Be aware that these types of discourses can sometimes lead to very heated and intense debate, and possibly something much worse. Guyanese are generally very open to discussing most issues, but as an outsider, you could be seen as a part of the problem - as absurd as that sounds - so guard your tongue.\n\nCrime is rarely directed at tourists, so don't feel intimidated. Just be sensible about the company you keep, where you go and how you behave.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Safety for gay visitors"]},"\nHomosexuality is illegal in Guyana and carries a sentence of life in prison. However, no one has been charged under the laws. One organisation ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.sasod.org.gy\/ SASOD"]}," organises some events to promote anti-homophobic work. There is no local gay \"scene\" as most homosexuals remain rather closeted. Private gatherings are known to occur to which one must be invited. Homosexuals who are openly gay are generally left alone providing they are circumspect about their behaviour. Public displays of affection among gay people are frowned upon and can make you the target of overt discrimination, attacks and taunts. There are no hotels, resorts or bars anywhere in the country which cater exclusively to gays and lesbian visitors or locals for that matter. Homophobia is sustained primarily through the influx of music which contains homophobic messages in their lyrics. The gay visitor is wise to be very cautious and conservative in his\/her behaviour.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Embassies and High Commissions"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["Canada"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Canada"],["url=http:\/\/www.canadainternational.gc.ca\/guyana\/"],["email=grgtn@international.gc.ca"],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+592 227-2081"],["tollfree="],["fax=+592 225-8380"],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["Brazil"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Brazil"],["url="],["email=bragetown@solutions2000.net"],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+592 225-7970"],["tollfree="],["fax=+592 226-9063"],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["China"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=China"],["url=http:\/\/gy.chineseembassy.org"],["email=chinaemb_gy@mfa.gov.cn"],["address=Lot 2, Mandela Ave, Botanic Gardens"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+592 227-1651"],["tollfree="],["fax=+592 231-6602"],["hours="],["price="],["phoneextra=Mobile +592 623-9058"],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["Germany"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Germany"],["url=http:\/\/www.port-of-spain.diplo.de\/Vertretung\/portofspain\/en\/02\/Honorarkonsuln\/site__hc.html"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+592 227-3344"],["tollfree="],["fax=+592 227-3360"],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["Suriname"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Suriname"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+592 226-7844"],["tollfree="],["fax=+592 223-7321"],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["United Kingdom"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=United Kingdom"],["url=http:\/\/ukinguyana.fco.gov.uk\/en\/"],["email=bhcguyana@solutions2000.net"],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+592 226-5881"],["tollfree="],["fax=+592 225-8380"],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["United States"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=United States"],["url=http:\/\/georgetown.usembassy.gov\/"],["email=usembassy@hotmail.com"],["address=100 Young and Duke Sts, Kingston"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+592 225-4900\/9"],["tollfree="],["fax=+592 225-8497"],["hours="],["price="],["phoneextra=Emergencies +592 225-4900\/9, after hours +592 623-1992"],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["Venezuela"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Venezuela"],["url=http:\/\/www.embvenezuelaenguyana.es.tl\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+592 226-1543"],["tollfree="],["fax=+592 225-3241 email="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Kaieteur Falls"]},".
