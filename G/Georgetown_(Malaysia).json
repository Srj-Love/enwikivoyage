Modern-day Georgetown is one of Malaysia's largest cities with 600,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe town seems quite relaxed, as restaurants, small shops, and mall shops don't fully open until around noon.  If you're waking up early, be sure to look for Chinese Dim Sum stalls as they are only available in the morning. But don't bother looking for any other activities besides eating.\n\nToday, the town is known for its well-preserved colonial core, with original shophouses dating from the 19th century to the 1930s still surviving, together with their trades of old. Street markets and hawkers continue to be a part of daily life, and the atmosphere is often likened to that of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Singapore"]]}," back in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe town truly springs to life in the evenings, when most of the locals head to the nearby street hawkers to have their meals and, sometimes, a couple of drinks.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["People"]},"\nLike most Malaysian cities, Georgetown is a patch quilt multicultural city comprising mainly of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Malays"]},", ethnic ",{"type":"'''","value":["Chinese"]}," and ethnic ",{"type":"'''","value":["Indians"]},". What separates Georgetown, and the state of Penang, from the rest is that there is a higher proportion of ethnic Chinese compared to Malays. With the combination of cultures and religions, Georgetown takes its religious holidays seriously. Many shops will close during certain holidays in addition to Saturday afternoon and Sunday.  During the day you can hear Muslim prayers in the distance from the local mosque and see Chinese locals burning incense to worship their ancestors on the streets and in temples.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Orientation"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Street names"]}," in Georgetown may be somewhat confusing at first, especially if you are not familiar with some simple ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Malay phrasebook"],["Malay"]]},". The most common Malay street name designations in Georgetown include ",{"type":"'''","value":["Jalan"]},", often abbreviated ",{"type":"''","value":["Jl"]},", a title given to major roads, street is given as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Lebuh"]}," and laneways or small side streets are called ",{"type":"'''","value":["Lorong"]},". Other less common street names you may see include ",{"type":"''","value":["Persiaran"]}," meaning Drive, ",{"type":"''","value":["Lebuhraya"]}," meaning Avenue and ",{"type":"''","value":["Pengkalan"]}," for Quay. When in doubt, keep in mind that the first word of a street name is the street designation, such as Lane, while the remaining words are always the name given to the street. The exception here is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Gat Lebuh"]}," street designation, meaning Street Ghaut, which refers to extensions of a street that are part of reclaimed land.\n\nYou will find that street names are often referred to by their English and Malay names interchangeably. In the case of ",{"type":"''","value":["Jalan Penang"]}," it is common to hear it as Penang Rd, or the more confusing Beach St for ",{"type":"''","value":["Lebuh Pantai"]},", with ",{"type":"''","value":["Pantai"]}," meaning Beach in Malay. To further add confusion, you may hear streets being referred to by their previous English name before independence. As an example ",{"type":"''","value":["Jalan Masjid Kapitan Keling"]},", previously titled Pitt Street, is still occasionally used by locals. Thankfully, many of the street signs have been altered in recent years to now include the English translation, especially around tourist areas.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh = 32"],["febhigh = 32"],["marhigh = 32"],["aprhigh = 32"],["mayhigh = 31"],["junhigh = 31"],["julhigh = 31"],["aughigh = 31"],["sephigh = 30"],["octhigh = 32"],["novhigh = 31"],["dechigh = 31"],["janlow = 24"],["feblow = 24"],["marlow = 24"],["aprlow = 24"],["maylow = 24"],["junlow = 24"],["jullow = 24"],["auglow = 24"],["seplow = 23"],["octlow = 24"],["novlow = 24"],["declow = 24"],["janprecip = 70"],["febprecip = 90"],["marprecip = 140"],["aprprecip = 230"],["mayprecip = 240"],["junprecip = 170"],["julprecip = 190"],["augprecip = 240"],["sepprecip = 350"],["octprecip = 390"],["novprecip = 240"],["decprecip = 110"],["description = Check ",{"type":"'''","value":["Georgetown's 7 day forecast"]}," at ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.met.gov.my\/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=684&Itemid=905 MET.gov.my"]}]]},"\n\nWith Georgetown being fairly close to the equator you can expect a typical ",{"type":"'''","value":["tropical"]}," climate.

Be extra careful in crowds and on roadsides, as they are the spots where petty crimes such as snatch thefts and pickpockets occur.\n\nSome local men like to yell things and make suggestive comments to women walking alone, and sometimes they can get \"too friendly\". If you are a woman, you should travel in a group. Men walking alone may have to deal with a similar amount of harassment too, especially around the Love Lane\/Lebuh Chulia areas. There are large numbers of prostitutes and\/or ladyboys prowling the streets here and they can be very aggressive. Over the last few years this problem seems to have faded away but it's still a good idea to exercise caution walking around at night.\n\nIf you look like a tourist, you will get considerably higher prices from the salesmen in markets, like Batu Ferringhi Night Market, or the market near the Kek Lok Si temple. The real price of the product is always a lot less and at times the \"best price\" is five times the normal price.\n\nTaxis generally do not use meters due to poor enforcement by local authorities, even though it is \"compulsory\". The meters are often claimed to be  \"broken\" or are hidden. You should always ask for the use of the meter. The metered price is always less than a price given in advance. Tourists are often cheated, sometimes even left by the roadside in the middle of nowhere if they refuse to pay a considerably inflated sum of money. You should negotiate the fare before boarding if the taxi driver refuses to use the meter, preferably seek a different taxi if they refuse to use the meter. Taxis from Penang Airport are paid using slips given in a small office in the airport building.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Do not use drugs, and stay away from them."]}," You will get the ",{"type":"'''","value":["death sentence"]}," if caught dealing with certain types of drugs and Malaysia's laws provide very harsh punishment for any drug related offence.
