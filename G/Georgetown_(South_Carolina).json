It was established in 1732, making it the state’s third oldest city, behind Charleston and Beaufort. The waterfront city is inhabited by many museums, shops, restaurants, and historic attractions. It is best seen by walking and boat tours.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThere are three major, must-see museums.  The first of these is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Kaminski House"]},".  It was built in the early 1700s and overlooks Front Street and the Sampit River.  It was the residence of three Georgetown mayors and named after one, Harold Kaminski. The inside of the museum includes much of the original flooring and molds, and it also houses many antiques as well as a store.  Admission to this museum is only $5. \n\nThe second museum is ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Rice Museum"]},". It is located in the Old Market building, which is known by locals as the town clock because of the clock faces located on all four sides of the bell tower. This museum focuses on telling the story of the rice culture in Georgetown through dioramas and films. This museum also contains a gift shop and just opened four permanent exhibits.  These all tell stories on different influential parts of Georgetown’s past. The most interesting of these exhibits include one on Miss Ruby Forsythe, who was one of South Carolina’s great educators, and an exhibit on Joseph Hayne Rainey, the first African American to be elected to the U.S. Congress. \n\nThe final museum that should be visited by tourists is ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Georgetown County Museum"]},".  It holds the stories of more than 300 years of Georgetown history. It includes artefacts from local Native American tribes, slave bills, plantation information, paper making tips from pine trees,  and letters from Revolutionary War Patriots. This building has the heart and soul of Georgetown history and it would be tragic to miss it. \n\nAnother historic attraction in Georgetown is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Strand Theatre"]},". This building is in the League of Historic American Theater listings. The box office was built for the 1987 movie “Made in Heaven”.

The best walking tours include historic ones, through museums and old buildings, and ghost tours, through the streets at nighttime.  These ghost tours are a huge hit in Georgetown because they are led by a story teller.  As the group walks through the dark streets, holding lanterns, the leader tells of the history of Georgetown, including all the ghosts that supposedly reside here. The tour is done as a group and is a great way to understand Georgetown through a fun activity. \n\nOther kinds of tours are boat tours. These tours take place in the marshland and the intracoastal waterways.  Participants can experience the city while getting a unique experience because they are learning from a boat.  The tours also include different information about Georgetown, which involves tales of plank walking and secrets about pirates and their treasures.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Marinas"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["The Harborwalk, Boat Shed, Hazzard"]},", and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Georgetown Landing Marina"]}," are the four major marinas located in this city.
