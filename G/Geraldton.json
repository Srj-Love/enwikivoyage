The Geraldton CSIRO facility provides support services to the Square Kilometre Array project located 315 km northeast of Geraldton. Geraldton is the main port for the Mid West of Western Australia, as well as the main regional centre. It is the last major town along the coast before Port Hedland.  It was historically a junction of narrow gauge railway lines that connected with the wehatbelt, and the inner parts of Western Australia.  It is now a junction of broad gauge lines (and planned lines as well) of iron ore trains travelling from mines.  \n\nGeraldton is a regional centre for tourism in the MidWest region of Western Australia with a variety of activities available to visitors including water sports such as kitesurfing, windsurfing, Stand Up Paddlesurfing, kayaking, fishing, scuba diving, snorkeling, boating and sailing. \n\nThe ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.geraldtonvisitorcentre.com.au\/ Geraldton Visitor's Centrer"]}," in the Bill Sewell Complex, just north of the City centre on Chapman Road can provide additional information.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThere is no current rail passenger service to Geraldton.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By plane "]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Geraldton airport (GET)"]}," is approximately 10km east of Geraldton.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Virgin Australia and QantasLink operate daily flights to and from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Perth"]]},"."]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By ship "]},"\n\nYou could arrive in Geraldton via cargo ship or cruise liner.
