Dark Orange: native language; Light orange: Secondary language or non-official; Orange square: German minorities"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["German"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["Deutsch"]},") is the official and main language of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Germany"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Austria"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Liechtenstein"]]},". It is also an official language of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Switzerland"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Luxembourg"]]}," and spoken as a regional language in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Namibia"]]},". It is also spoken in the French regions of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alsace"]]}," (German: ",{"type":"''","value":["Elsass"]},") and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lorraine"]]}," (German: ",{"type":"''","value":["Lothringen"]},"), in the northern Italian province of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South Tyrol"]]}," (German: ",{"type":"''","value":["Südtirol"]},", Italian: ",{"type":"''","value":["Alto Adige"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["Sudtirolo"]},"), and in a small part of eastern ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Belgium"]]}," and southern ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Denmark"]]},". Standard German (Hochdeutsch) is also generally spoken by many as a second language in much of East-Central Europe. Small groups of native German speakers can be found in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. This is due to the historical influence of Austria - the former Austrian Empire, and Germany over the region and the radical border changes put into place in Europe after WWI. Furthermore, small isolated communities can be found in Russia, the Central Asian Republics, Australia, South Africa and in North and South America.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Grammar & Dialects"]},"\nMany languages in northern Europe belong to the Germanic language family, although German grammar itself retains many conjugations and declensions from proto-Germanic that have since been lost by other language relatives such as English.\n\nIn common with many other European languages, German has two \"you\" verb forms which denote the relationship the speaker has to someone else. To express familiarity, one uses the ",{"type":"''","value":["du"]}," form; for formality, the ",{"type":"''","value":["Sie"]}," form. As a general rule the ",{"type":"''","value":["Sie"]}," form is used when one might address someone as \"Madam\" or \"Sir\". If on first name terms, one uses the ",{"type":"''","value":["du"]}," form. Grammatically, the ",{"type":"''","value":["Sie"]}," form takes the 3rd person plural ending.\n\nGerman nouns are divided into 3 different genders: masculine, feminine and neuter. The article of a noun depends on the gender: ",{"type":"''","value":["der"]}," (m),  ",{"type":"''","value":["die"]}," (f) and ",{"type":"''","value":["das"]}," (n). Inanimate objects frequently have, often arbitrarily, genders assigned to them; for example, ",{"type":"''","value":["Tisch"]}," (table) is male, ",{"type":"''","value":["Tür"]}," (door) is female, while ",{"type":"''","value":["Tor"]}," (gate) is neuter. While the gender nouns denoting a person usually correspond to their natural gender (for example ",{"type":"''","value":["Mutter"]}," (mother) is female and ",{"type":"''","value":["Vater"]}," (father) is male), there are some exceptions. A grammatical rule that overrides this includes the diminutive ",{"type":"''","value":["-chen"]}," noun ending which will result in a neuter. (for example ",{"type":"''","value":["Mädchen"]}," (girl) is actually neuter, and not female as you'd expect). \n\nThird-person pronouns also depend on the grammatical gender of the subject: ",{"type":"''","value":["er"]},"  (m), ",{"type":"''","value":["sie"]}," (f) and ",{"type":"''","value":["es"]}," (n). However, you will generally be understood if you use the wrong gender as there are only a few (obscure) nouns which mean different things depending on gender, and their correct meaning will always be clear from the context.\n\nFurthermore, German nouns are declined. There are four grammatical cases: nominative (subject), accusative (direct object), genitive (possessive), and dative (indirect object). Each varies depending on the noun's gender and whether it is singular or plural.\n\nAll nouns begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence. This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.\n\nThere are very strong accentual and dialectic differences in German-speaking countries. A German from the north and one from the south of the country can have great difficulty understanding each other's dialects. Standard German, or \"Hochdeutsch\", is universally known and taught, and although not everyone speaks it well it can be understood by most German speakers. Generally, the further south one travels, the broader the influence of dialect on standard speech. The Main river serves as a rough \"border\" between the northern and southern German speaking cultural worlds. Switzerland, in particular, tends to use its own form of German, even often in the media. As a rule, one should not expect all people one encounters (especially in the rural areas) of Alsace, Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Austria, South Tyrol and Switzerland to speak standard German well, but a dialect instead. In Alsace most people prefer to speak French with outsiders, and do NOT consider their dialect to be German as such! Dialect, where still spoken, is very much for family and home. People in Alsace are often reluctant to speak High German with Germans! They are often less put off speaking their dialect to someone from Switzerland or Baden, due to the fact they are pretty much mutually intelligible.\n\nIn the north of Germany, some people speak a related language called ",{"type":"''","value":["Plattdüütsch"]}," or Low German (\"Plattdeutsch\" in German). It is very closely related to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dutch phrasebook"],["Dutch"]]}," and mainland Scandinavian languages. Nearly all Platt speakers also speak German.\n\nThe German spoken in Switzerland is referred to as ",{"type":"''","value":["Schwiizertüütsch"]},". There are various varieties of Swiss German depending on the region and it is even widely used in the media. Dialects are not usually used in the media in Germany, Austria or Liechtenstein except for regional programming. Thus, this is rare in the German speaking world, as \"Hochdeutsch\" is more or less the sole language of media outside Switzerland. Nevertheless, all German-speaking Swiss learn standard German in school, and usually write in standard German, so unless you approach somebody really old who has never been to school, you'll be fine with standard German. The German dialects spoken in Vorarlberg (Austria), Baden-Württemberg (Germany) and Alsace (France) are related to Swiss German.\n\nIn the Italian South Tyrol, like in most of Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and southern Germany, most people speak a local dialect. However, standard German and Italian are both taught in the schools. The German spoken in South Tyrol is very similar to that of neighboring Austria and Bavaria to the north.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Pronunciation guide"]},"\nGerman pronunciation is relatively straightforward, although spelling is somewhat more involved.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Vowels"]},"\n; a : like 'u' in \"cup\", 'a' in \"target\".
