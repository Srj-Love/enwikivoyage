The fighting started accidentally when Union and Confederate troops converged just north of the town of Gettysburg. Three bloody days of fighting ensued, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. The Confederate forces fell back after Lee's final frontal assault broke on the third day. After touring the three days of Gettysburg, follow the Confederate Retreat through Fairfield, just 8 miles west of Gettyburg on PA Route 116, through beautiful rolling countryside and farms. As you drive the 8 miles try to imagine a soldier who has just participated in what will become the largest battle ever fought in North America, tired, hungry, possibly wounded, retreating from the Union in a driving rain storm through mud into the town of Fairfield — most likely the longest 8 miles ever marched! The town, itself, was raided by the Confederates in 1862 and during the retreat on July 4, 1863. It is worth the drive. You can pick up an area tour guide and map at the Fairfield Inn located in the center of town.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\nFlat meadows surrounded by rocky hills, with views of the Blue Ridge Mountains looming in the distance. In the countryside north of Gettysburg is the \"Fruit Belt\" of Pennsylvania with thousands of acres of apple and peach orchards and vineyards.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nGettysburg has a humid continental climate, with hot, humid summers and cold moist winters.  Spring and Fall are mild and pleasant.  Heavy winter storms occasionally strike the area, but these are fairly rare.  Heaviest snowfall occurs during February and early March.  Severe thunderstorms may occasionally hit the region, mostly in July and August.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By plane"]}," \n\nSeveral airports are in the region, although none of them are particularly closeby.  Airports in Harrisburg (MDT), Baltimore (BWI), Washington Dulles (IAD), and Philadelphia (PHL) are the closest.  Flying into Baltimore would probably be your best bet, as the drive to Gettysburg is approximately 60 miles.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By car"]},"\n\nGettysburg can be reached via US Rt 30 from Philadelphia, or via State Rt 97 from the Baltimore area.  From the south, US 15 runs through the town for visitors arriving from the Washington DC region.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By train"]}," \nAmtrak has stations in both Harrisburg and Lancaster. Taxi service and car rentals are available to Gettysburg from there.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\n\nAccess to the battlefields are free at all times.  However, museums carry a small fee. The cost to get into the Gettysburg National Military Park Museum and Visitor Center is $10.50 for adults and includes a short film and entry to see the Gettysburg Cyclorama Painting.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By car"]},"\n\nBy far the best way to see the park is with your own vehicle.  Roads wind extensively throughout the battlefields, and include many places to pull off and allow visitors to walk around.  Use caution when using these roads, as there may be many people walking or bicycling on these roads.  The speed limit throughout the park is 15 MPH. When in your car, you may navigate by map or purchase a CD at several locations throughout Gettysburg that will orientate you to the battlefield.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nGuided tours on buses are available for fees of $22-25 for adults, and $12-15 for children aged 4-11.

Cycling the major sites of the July 1-3 campaign can be completed in one day and allow the visitor to experience battle lines and topography in a much more realistic fashion than car or bus.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By horseback"]},"\nThe battlefield features a couple horse trails where you can either bring your own horse or rent one from places around town, including Artillery Ridge Campground and Hickory Hollow Horse Farm.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By Segway"]},"\nThere are two places in town — SegTours, LLC and Segs in the City that lease Segway personal transporters for battlefield and town tours.

The Spring brings the Apple Blossoms to the area's orchards and is fantastic for the golf enthusiast with over a dozen courses nearby. Summer is hot and crowded with families although mid-week is still comfortable for sightseeing. The Fall brings Apple Harvests and beautiful changing of the leaves, while Winter boasts sweeping vistas and great skiing and snow boarding in Fairfield, PA, only 8 miles west of Gettysburg on PA Route 116.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nNearby destinations suitable for day trips include:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Harrisburg"]]}]}," — Explore the Capital of PA."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Hershey (Pennsylvania)"]]}]}," — Explore chocolate country."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Lancaster (Pennsylvania)"]]}]}," — Explore Amish country."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["York (Pennsylvania)"]]}]}," — Explore Central PA country."]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=US 30.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["directionl1=W"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pittsburgh"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chambersburg"]]}],["directionr1=E"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lancaster (Pennsylvania)"],["Lancaster"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["York (Pennsylvania)"],["York"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usablepark"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["39.828333"],["-77.232222"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Pennsylvania Dutch Country"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Gettysburg, Pennsylvania"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North_America\/United_States\/Pennsylvania\/Localities\/G\/Gettysburg\/"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Gettysburg, Pennsylvania"]]}]
