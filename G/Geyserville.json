I cannot recommend this place enough.  Stop in for a drink at the bar and if you're lucky Sean the bartender will make you whatever specialty he is making that evening.  Elegant yet hearty Italian food which focuses on flavor and fresh ingredients.  Especially great on a Summer night when you can sit on their back patio.)\nThere is a great brunch place just past town (next to the Geyserville Inn) in an old victorian home.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=US_101.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["directionl1=N"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Eureka"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cloverdale (California)"],["Cloverdale"]]}],["directionr1=S"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Santa Rosa (California)"],["Santa Rosa"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Healdsburg"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["38.70778"],["-122.90250"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Sonoma County"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Geyserville, California"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North_America\/United_States\/California\/Localities\/G\/Geyserville\/"]]}]
