Nonetheless, there is no proof that those early dwellers are related to the current inhabitants of the area. Oral tradition has it that many of Ghana's current ethnic groups such as the multi-ethnic Akan, the Ga and the Ewe arrived around the 13th Century AD. However, the Dagombas are believed to be the first settlers, having been fully established by 1210 AD, before the arrival of other ethnic groups. Modern Ghanaian territory includes what was the Empire of Ashanti, one of the most influential states in sub-Saharan Africa before colonial rule.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Colonial era"]},"\nEarly European contact by the Portuguese, who came to Ghana in the 15th century, focused on the extensive availability of gold. By 1548, the Dutch had joined them, and built forts at Komenda and Kormantsi. Other European traders joined in by the mid 17th century, largely English, Danes and Swedes. British merchants, impressed with the gold resources in the area, named it the Gold Coast, while French merchants, impressed with the trinkets worn by the coastal people, named the area to the west \"Côte d'Ivoire\", or Ivory Coast. The Gold Coast was known for centuries as 'The White Man's Grave' because many of the Europeans who went there died of malaria and other tropical diseases. \n\nAfter the Dutch withdrew in 1874, Britain made the Gold Coast a protectorate. Following conquest by the British in 1896, until independence in March 1957, the territory of modern Ghana excluding the Volta Region (British Togoland), was known as the Gold Coast.\n\nMany wars occurred between the colonial powers and the various nation-states in the area and even under colonial rule the chiefs and people often resisted the policies of the British. Moves toward de-colonization intensified after World War II and after an intense struggle, on March 6th 1957 elected parliamentary leader Kwame Nkrumah declared Ghana as \"free forever\". The nation thus became the first sub-Saharan African country to gain its independence.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Modern era"]},"\nKwame Nkrumah was a champion of pan-Africanism and his popularity was a major concern for the West. It was no surprise that Nkrumah was subsequently overthrown by the military while he was  abroad in February 1966. \nA series of subsequent coups from 1966 to 1981 ended with the ascension to power of the flamboyant  Flight Lieutenant Jerry Rawlings in 1981. These changes resulted in the suspension of the constitution in 1981 and the banning of political parties. The economy suffered a severe decline soon after, and many Ghanaians migrated to other countries. \n\nRawlings changed many old economic policies and the economy soon began to recover. A new constitution restoring multi-party politics was instigated in 1992, and Rawlings was elected as president then and again in 1996.  In 2009, John Atta Mills took office as president marking the second time that power had been transferred from one legitimately elected leader to another, and securing Ghana's status as a stable democracy.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nThere are two main seasons in Ghana, the wet and the dry seasons.

British diplomatic posts charge GBP50 to process a Ghanaian visa application and an extra GBP70 if the authorities in Ghana require the visa application to be referred to them. The authorities in Ghana can also decide to charge an additional fee if they correspond with you directly.\n\nTravellers who are staying longer than their entry visa (a maximum of 30 or 60 days are usually granted for tourists) are advised to bring their passport for visa extension to Immigration Service early and expect delays in getting their passports back. Two weeks are provided as the guideline for processing time, but this can often take much longer. Be careful about what dates are stamped in your passport. Sometimes Immigration puts a 60 day stamp on a visa for 3 months- the stamps is what counts.  If you don't want to go through the hassle of Immigration Service, you may consider going to Togo and back to get a visa stamp at the border.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]}," \nAll International flights are through Kotoka International airport at Accra (ACC) ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ghanaairports.com.gh"]},".

You have to cross the border by foot (after leaving Burkina Faso, you walk some 300 m through no-man's-land before reaching Ghana customs. Locals will be lingering around and will be looking to change money at fairly reasonable rates). Then take a Metro Mass bus to Wa (alternatively hop on a tro-tro and do the trip in stages). Be sure to take an early bus from Bobo: if the bus has a delay, you may end up having to spend the night in Hamile.

'Express' or 'Air-conditioned' services are quicker and a lot more comfortable than the ordinary services and are now available on the Accra-Kumasi, Accra-Tamale, Accra-Bolgatanga routes. Buy your tickets a day in advance though, oftentimes they will be full if you wait until the day of travel. Also, expect to pay for your luggage based upon its weight.

Similarly to 'shared' taxis, tro-tros will run along fixed routes and have fixed fares, and will rarely run with less than capacity [so be prepared to wait]. They are inexpensive (cheaper than shared taxis and STC buses) and fares should reflect distance travelled, however they have a questionable safety record and frequently breakdown. Breakdowns however are usually not too much of a problem since they will break down in a route where other tro-tro's run, so you can just grab another one. Although they generally run point to point they will usually pick and drop on route if required. They make runs within the city (i.e. Circle to Osu for GHS0.20) as well as intercity routes. They are often the only option between remote towns but are not recommended for long journeys. Tro-tros are an excellent way to meet Ghanaians, and are always great for a cultural adventure.

To charter a taxi is more expensive than to share one, but prices are negotiable and almost always need to be bargained over. Always settle on a fare before getting in. A taxi for a very short route should be no more than GHS1.00, longer GHS2.50-5.00 and GHS8.00 should be enough for most places in the city. As of December 2011, you can use a rough rate of GHS1.00 for every 1.5 km travelled (check Google Maps for the distance between places).  Fares continue to fluctuate with the fuel prices on the international market. Almost every taxi driver will start with a high price that is 1.5x-3x the local price if you're a foreigner and then you'll have to bargain them down. You'll get the best price when you start to walk away from the taxi.

Alternatively you could take the waters inland instead, Volta Lake created by the damming of the River Volta at Akosombo in the mid 1960s to provide a source of electricity to Ghana now also provides a wonderful viewing point from the dam itself or trips out onto the lake itself or you can take a trip on the River Volta instead at Ada.  \n\nIn the Ashanti region not far from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kumasi"]]}," is Lake Bosumtwi, a 10.5km diameter meteor impact crater lake, which was created by a meteor strike approximately 1 million years ago, as well a being extremely picturesque the lake holds a spiritual significance to the Ashanti, whose traditional belief asserts that souls of the dead meet the god Twi at the lake. \n\nAlso inland, are two more national treasures in the form of two world renowned national parks.

When it was introduced, it was the highest-valued currency unit issued by a sovereign African country.\n\nYou will encounter a variety of currency notations locally, including \n\"GH₵\" instead of \"GHS\". Banknotes are issued in 50, 20, 10, 5, 2 and 1 new Ghana cedi denominations. \n\nOne new Ghana cedi is divided into one hundred new Ghana pesewas (Gp).\nCoins of GHS1, 0.50 0.20, 0.10, 0.05 and 0.01 circulate. The one pesewa coins are rare in the system since you hardly find items that can be bought for less than 5 pesewas.\n\nBe aware that most Ghanaians still think in old currency. This can be very confusing (and costly). Ten thousand old cedis are habitually referred to as ten (or twenty, or thirty). This would, today, be one, two, or three \"new\" Ghana cedis. So always think whether the quoted price makes sense before buying or agreeing on a taxi fare. If in doubt ask whether this is new cedis.\n\nUS dollars are accepted by some of the major tourist hotels, but you shouldn't rely on this.

Most goods will be staple goods, but cloth, beads, musical instruments, bags, and even CD's are usually available.\n\nKente cloth, drums and wooden designs, such as masks and \"sacred stools\" can be found on almost any street in any tourist area in Ghana. \n\nThe accra mall is a first class and commercial shopping centre situated\non the spintex road of the Tetteh Quarshie Interchange.(www.accramall.com).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Adinkrah symbols and sacred stools"]},"\nThe sacred stools have traditional Adinkrah \"motif\" designs in them that can mean many things having to do with God, love, strength, community, and much more. Finding a guidebook which will tell you what each symbol means is advisable to prevent the possibility of buying a stool that doesn't mean what you think it is. \n\nGye Nyame is by far the most popular Adinkrah symbol.

Fufu, the most widely served traditional dish, consists of pounded balls of yam, plantain, or cassava served with soup, and a side of goat meat or fish. Soups are typically made of  groundnuts, palm nut, okra and other vegetables. Banku is a fermented corn version of the dish typically eaten with grilled tilapia fish or okra soup.\n\nRice dishes are also typical, but not considered a \"real\" meal by many Ghanaians, males especially. Jollof rice is a dish as varied as its chef, but generally consists of white rice cooked with vegetables, meat pieces, spices in a tomato based sauce. Waakye is a mix of beans and rice, typically served with gari, a powder of ground cassava. Often rice dishes are served with shredded lettuce, cucumber and tomatoes on the side with a dollop of Heinz salad cream or mayonnaise. Such meals are extremely cheap from street vendors and come as little as GHS1.50 to GHS2.50. \n\nPlantains, yams, and sweet potatoes are prepared in various ways and serve as small snacks. Kelewele, a spiced fried plantain snack, is especially delicious. Fresh fruits such as pineapple, mango, papaya, coconut, oranges, and bananas are delightful when in season and come when applicable by the bag for as little as 10 cents. \n\nA great African meal in a restaurant can cost as little as GHS3.00 to GHS7.00. For instance, a lobster and shrimp dinner can cost a mere GHS6. There are also a number of Western and Chinese style restaurants available especially in Osu, a trendy suburb of Accra.\n\nThere is also banku and tilapia.The price of the tilapia varies based on the size as well as where you buy it from.\nThere are other local traditional meals that are not so common example are the Aprapransa, mpotompoto etc\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]}," \nDrinking water from the tap is not generally considered to be safe, so choices include plastic bottled water (e.g. Voltic, 1.5 L, c.

Many foreigners prefer bottled water.  \n\nAt least one study",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12969499"]}," has suggested bottled water to be the safest choice.  \nAlthough \"pure water\" sachets are more easily accessible, 2.3% of sachets tested were found to contain faecal bacteria.  If you want to play it safe, stick with carbonated beverages or bottled water. \n\nIn Accra's expat visited bars, a beer will cost between GHS2.00 and GHS4.00. Fruit juices GHS1.50, water GHS1.00 to GHS1.50. Star and Club are two of the more popular beers served. For a more interesting and rewarding experience, visit a \"spot,\" a bar signified by the blue and white stripes on the outside of the building.  They are cheaper and you will undoubtedly be able to meet some local Ghanaians as well as hear the newest hip-life songs.\n\nA soft drink such as Coke, Alvaro, Fanta, 7UP (called \"minerals\" by locals) are widely available for GHS0.70.\n\nBe aware that the bottles that minerals or beer is served to you in are owned by the bottling company-if you do not return it to the seller, they stand to lose GHS0.50 -- more than you most likely paid for the drink.  If you are not going to consume the drink at the \"spot\" or at the roadside stand, make sure you let the seller know.  Often, you will be asked for a deposit which will be returned upon the return of the bottle.There also traditional drinks like \"pito\", asaana,burkina,bisarrp drink (sobolo)\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]}," \nThere are many wonderful places to stay in Ghana.
