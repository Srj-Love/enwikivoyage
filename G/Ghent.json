Its size and position allow the inhabitants to enjoy a city with an interesting crossover between open cosmopolitanism and the quiet atmosphere of a provincial town.  Ghent is thriving as many young people choose to live here instead of in the countryside or the crowded and disintegrating city centers of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brussels"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Antwerp"]]},".\n\nGhent is a city of history. During the Middle Ages, it was one of the richest and most powerful cities in Europe. It was once considered the second largest city north of the alps, after Paris.  The impact of this rich past can be clearly seen when viewing the imposing architecture of churches and the houses of rich traders. The whole of the city center is restored in this fashion, and still breathes the atmosphere of a thriving late-medieval city state.  As the city council made the center free of cars, it is now a very welcoming and open area, which does not fail to impress even the people who live there.\n\nGhent is also a university city with more than 50,000 students.  As such, its streets are filled with young people.  But, unlike Leuven, another university town in Flanders, youth is not the only category of people living there.  There is an interesting mixture of foreigners who came to live there, or artists, among the native people of Ghent.  Interestingly, other than the smaller provincial cities or the bigger city of Antwerp, this mixture makes the people more tolerant and open-minded.  This atmosphere seeps into every aspect of city life.  Many people of Ghent truly see the place like home, and are very proud to live there, seeing it as a place that will always welcome them back home.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\nGhent is only a 30-minute train ride away from Brussels and is on the line from Brussels to Bruges and the coast. If you're planning to visit Bruges and Brussels, definitely stop over in Ghent as well. There are also direct trains to Brussels Airport, Antwerp, Lille and Paris.\n\nThere are two train stations in Ghent, Gent-Dampoort and Gent-Sint-Pieters. Gent-Sint-Pieters is the main station, to go to the centre, take tram 1 (until 'Korenmarkt').  Journey time is ten minutes. Gent-Dampoort is located closer to the center (about 15 minutes walk), but only trains coming from\/in the direction of Antwerp stop there.\n\nIf you're visiting from Bruges, Brussels or Antwerp during the weekend, it's much cheaper to get a return ticket (special rate: weekendreturn).\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Sint-Niklaaskerk (Gent).JPG"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Saint Nicholas' Church, viewed from the belfry"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nThe dense highway network in Belgium allows you to access Ghent easily by car. Two main highways E40 (Liège-Brussels-Ghent-Bruges-Ostend) and E17 (Antwerp-Ghent-Kortrijk-Lille) cross at Ghent. Brussels and Antwerp are 40 min away, Bruges 30 min.
