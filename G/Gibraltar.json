Some Gibraltarians also feel sensitive to the erroneous use of the term 'colony' due to its connotations of being a deposited population or ruled by a foreign country or lacking in self-government, none of which apply to Gibraltar either now or historically. Additionally, the term 'colony' is legally incorrect; it is a 'British Overseas Territory'. The term 'colony' wasn't used in reference to Gibraltar until the 1830s, at which time there were other places that were colonies and Gibraltar was grouped with them under the term colonies, despite the circumstances being different.\n\nAlthough the popular view is that the Spanish Government is the cause of many problems concerning Gibraltar, there is no animosity directed by Gibraltarians towards Spanish individuals in general; Spanish tourists and workers experience no problems. Recent airport agreements have opened up the relationship Gibraltar has with Spain.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Go next "]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Gibraltar"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Gibraltar"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Europe\/Gibraltar\/"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Iberia"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["36.138706"],["-5.347422"]]}]
