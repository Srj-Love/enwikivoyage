However, as the islands are only a few km in diameter, it's entirely possible to just walk instead.\n\nTravelling between the islands requires either catching the infrequent scheduled Koperasi ",{"type":"'''","value":["Island hopping"]}," boats, or chartering one to take you across. To Lombok you can take one of the very cheap public boats that go back and forth at pretty random intervals (basically leaving whenever the boat is full), or again charter a vessel. \n\nTickets can be bought from the ticket offices on each island from where the boats depart. No need to pre-book, the approximate rates in Indonesian rupiah as of mid 2014 are as follows: Gili Trawangan to Lombok by Public boat is a mere IDR13,000 (not much more than a dollar). A charter (with 30 capacity) will set you back roughly IDR400,000; still quite affordable, especially if you split the bill with a group of other travellers.

During the peak seasons (Jul-Aug, Dec-Jan), it pays to make advance reservations, as the best places are often fully booked. Arrive early for better chances of getting accommodation without a reservation. Late arrivals need to be prepared to spend a night on the beach (it's perfectly safe though).\n\nThere are plenty of largely identical backpacker guesthouses on the islands.  The price ranges depending on the season and island. Figure on Rp 100,000+ for a basic room with fan only. Air conditioned rooms are more in the Rp 300,000-400,000+ range. Gili Trawangan especially, has a rapidly increasing range of high end luxury accommodation with prices up to US$500 per night for a large private villa. \n\nAlways try to negotiate for the best price, and be clear about whether or not the quoted price includes taxes and breakfast.
