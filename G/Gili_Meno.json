Seems to be closed during the low season, however.\n\nIndonesian GSM operators (at least XL, Telkomsel, and 3; Indosat has a signal too) have their towers standing at Meno, obviously to cover Air and Trawangan on either sides. As such, signal strength is excellent here, much better than on Gili Air, as well as internet (EDGE) connection speed. So, if you have you own laptop\/smartphone - bring an Indonesian SIM card (unlimited access, as of 2011, costs Rp.38,500 to 150,000\/month, smaller traffic-based or daily\/weekly packages are available too). Do not forget to load enough money before arriving - the nearest place selling top-up cards seems to be Gili Trawangan, and sellers there tend to charge huge (up to 50%) commission. As of February 2011, Indonesian operator \"3\" (which offers cheapest monthly Internet packages), while have covered Gilis just recently, had fairly good EDGE speed on Meno, while more expensive Indosat was painfully slow. This can change in the future, however, due to heavier local usage and\/or changes in coverage.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Hop on a boat for 15 minutes to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gili Trawangan"]]}," for a night on the tiles."]},{"type":"*","value":["Back to the rural delights of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Lombok"]]}," and mighty ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mount Rinjani"]]},"."]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Gili Islands"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["guidecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["no Wikipedia link"]]}]
