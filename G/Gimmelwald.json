This trail is absolutely spectacular. Rick Steves' guide recommends that you hike down from the Schilthorn, but walking up, while more strenuous on the body and heart, is much easier on the legs and balance.  It is an intensive trail for non-hikers (but very do-able). It will take at least 5 hours for most people to get to the top of the Schilthorn from Gimmelwald, so pack a lunch and leave early. After passing Schiltalp (the last tiny town you will see on the hike) and crossing a stream of water, the trail will suddenly get steeper. Be careful of the sudden drops and take the hike slower as you get to higher altitudes if you are not used to slightly lower oxygen levels than normal (the summit is over 2900m). Hiking poles are helpful on the way up, and almost necessary on the way down. Bring warm clothes because up high there is snow nearly year round, and the weather can change very quickly while you are underway. The gondola ride down is 48,80 CHF, with a 25% reduction for Eurail passholders.
