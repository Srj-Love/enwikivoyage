It experiences crime that is typical of any city its size, but visitors have little to worry about from the town itself beyond possibly pickpocketing in large crowds. However, it is not uncommon to see local drunks and other vagabonds at the entrances to the footbridges across the Onyar River, especially on the Old Town side.  While they generally keep to themselves, they will often beg for change.\n\nWhile not the destination that Barcelona is for \"stag\" parties from Northern Europe, Girona does see its fair share of them given that many of them fly in to the Girona Airport on their way to Barcelona.\n\nIt should go without saying as it would seem obvious, but don't attempt to jump in to the Onyar River from any of the bridges across it.
