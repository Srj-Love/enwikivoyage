[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Giza banner.jpg"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Giza"]}," is a district in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cairo"]]},", capital city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Egypt"]]},".\n\nMany people have the opinion that Cairo and Egypt as a whole is not for kids because of the hot sun and that many kids don't like seeing ruins. But, on the contrary that kind of statement is not true at all. There is so much for kids to and see and not get bored.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nTransportation in Giza is very easy to use. There is the bus and the metro. However the metro and the bus aren't in great condition. The best way is to take a black and white taxi. The ticket costs and the taxi costs will amount up to the same. The best way to get a taxi for your kids has three simple rules. First rule is Haggle to about 30% down. The second rule is to see the taxi before choosing your price. The third and last rule is to skip the first 3 guys in line.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["The Giza Plateau for Kids"]},"\nThe Giza Plateau has so much to offer for kids than at anywhere else in the world. The ancient wonders are breathtaking as you see them.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["The Pyramids of Giza for Kids"]},"\nThe pyramids of Giza are quite expensive to get around. There are separate tickets for each of the pyramids. The guy at the office will tell you that the area ticket is fine but its not. The area ticket only allows you to visit the Sphinx and the area around the pyramids. You need a separate ticket to go into the different pyramids. The only pyramids that are worth seeing are the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Great Pyramid of Khufu"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Khafre's Pyramid"]},".\n\nThe Great Pyramid of Khufu is worth visiting just for the curiosity. After seeing all the outside of the grand pyramid you naturally want to see the inside of the pyramid. One thing is for sure about that pyramid, it gives you some great exercise. It is really worth seeing because all the hieroglyphics are still there and unless you are an expert at translating hieroglyphics it's such a great mystery. Even if you can't read it you will just love looking at the intricately carved figures.\n\nKhafre's pyramid is actually the pyramid style that most people know today. The pyramid style in the Great Pyramid of Khufu is the style that the tomb is closer to the top of the pyramid. The sarcophagus of Khafre is underground. You actually go under the pyramid to see his tomb. Although in both pyramids his body is not there.\n\nMinakure's pyramid isn't really a great pyramid to visit. However if you are on a tight budget it is the best to go there. The entrance to the pyramid costs 30 Egyptian pounds, 6 USD. The pyramid is just like a smaller version of the Great Pyramid of Khufu.\n\nTake notice that seeing the pyramids will take up the whole day.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["The Egyptian Museum for Kids"]},"\nThe Egyptian Museum has a lot to offer for kids. The most interesting is the Mummy Room. The entrance for the Mummy Room costs 100 Egyptian Pounds. But after everything it is definitely worth it beyond anything. There are about 15 different mummies in the mummy room. One thing about the mummies is that they are short.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["The Sound and Light Show for Kids"]},"\nThe pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in the area for kids. You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins. Usually you always here the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of the sound and light is just like a story book. The Sphinx is set as the backdrop and the narrator of a long story. The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are lit up.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Outlinetopic"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["PartOfTopic"],["Travelling with children"]]}]
