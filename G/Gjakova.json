Around 75% of town's population was driven out by Serbian Army during the war, and much of city's buildings were burnt or otherwise destroyed—by both sides of belligerents, as it seems. After the war, much of town's ethnic Albanian inhabitants returned (who now make up to 95% of the population), but it was the local Serbs to be exiled this time. Many of the stores at the downtown area, locally known as ",{"type":"''","value":["Qarshia e Madhe"]},", were rebuilt.\n\nWhile in Gjakova, make sure you talk to the locals, especially the young ones, since they're more proficient in English. And you will hear a story about every corner of the city. Talking about the past is a very actual subject,  but people avoid it since many families there have lost at least one dear member.\n\nAlmost every inhabitant of the town has relatives in Switzerland or Germany. So especially during the summer months you will see many expensive foreign cars from these countries circling around the city. The foreign family members come here for vacation as well for marriages because this way the whole family can join the wedding. The village is specialized on marriages so that you will find an unexpected number of shops specialized to this.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nFrom Albania there are minibuses from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shkodra"]]}," via the Lake Koman\/Lake Fierza and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bajram Curri"]]},". There is also a Minibus (called \"Furgon\" in Albanian) directly from Bajram Curry that starts at 8 AM.\nThe city can also be reached directly by bus from every city in the Kosovo.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nSince the city is not that big, the best way to get to see it is by walking. \nTaxis are quite cheap, you can get around the city for €2-3 tops.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nAlmost all of the old architecture has been rebuilt after the destruction during the war. So enjoy the walk through the nice old town. There you should visit the old guesthouse\/restaurant from the 19th century and the small street with shops specialized in woodworks. The church and the main mosque have also been rebuilt and can be visited (opening times change).\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Radoniqi Lake"]}," is worth visiting! It's close to the airport, 7 km away. Taking a cab to there wouldn't cost more than €15. Beware though, it's the drinking water source of the town, therefore swimming is prohibited!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nGjakova city offers many things to do, and the prices too are low.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\nThere are countless shops offering \"Bling Bling\" products like jewellery, wedding dresses, blinking high heels etc..

There live music during weekends, either Rock or Albanian folk music (mainly in restaurants on wedding occasions).\n\nOne of the best places to go is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hard Rock Caffe - Gjakova"]},", cheap prices and good music. Also well-known local band called \"NA\" plays live every Wednesday night. So don't miss it!\n\nDomestically brewed ",{"type":"'''","value":["Peja Beer"]}," is a must.
