So \"Did you enjoy the concert last night?\" might be answered \"Aye it was pure dead brilliant man\" which means, essentially, \"Yes, it was good\".\n\nOne common misunderstanding between Scots and foreigners is that when the question \"How are you?\" is asked, you should not answer by telling them if you are not fine, and then go on to elaborate by describing what has happened to make you unhappy.

But always check what the controlled hours are - these are shown on the ticket machines themselves and on adjacent signs.  If attempting to park on the free periods - get there as early as possible before the locals do.  Some parking areas are for residents only: DON'T be tempted to use them as you run the risk of being towed away!\n\nThere are many multi-storey car parks in the city centre; they are clearly signposted into \"East\", \"West\", \"North\" and \"South\" zones on all the approaches into the central area with an electronic display showing how many spaces are left in each.  They don't, however, differentiate between the expensive NCP ones and the cheaper ones inside shopping malls or run by the council.\n\nIn general, driving in Glasgow's central area should be avoided if you are not a confident driver, as there are one way systems, bus lanes and pedestrian precincts.  Glaswegians are not the most patient drivers in the world, and they particularly dislike hesitancy (taxi drivers being the worst culprits). Parking restrictions are strictly enforced, and vehicles parked illegally or in an obstructive manner may be towed away and the owner of the vehicle would be liable for a ¬£150 release charge to recover it.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["As of May 2012, the city has introduced licence plate recognition cameras and extra manned patrols on the bus lanes within the city centre, getting caught will incur a ¬£30 fixed penalty!"]},"\n\nIf, however, you are confident enough to hire a car or require it to save money on your travel, all the major rental companies and some lesser ones are at the airport.

The bad news is that in July 2013 they had become as rare as hen's teeth; there is a good chance that the information desk at the Buchanan Street Bus Station may still have one that you can consult.

It is not called \"The Tube\" by locals, but you will be understood if you call it this.\n\nThe Subway runs from the city centre through to the West End (around Glasgow University), then runs south of the Clyde through Ibrox Stadium and back into the city. Direct interchanges with surface trains are at Buchanan Street and Partick stations; Argyle Street interchanges with Central station through a short walk on street level.\n\nThe system operates 6:30AM ‚Äì 11:15PM on all days, except Sunday when it operates 10AM ‚Äì 5:50PM Trains generally run every 4 ‚Äì 8 minutes.\n\nThe system uses smart card ticketing.

Tickets are issued per ride, rather than by distance, so single and return fares are the same no matter how many stations you wish to travel through. No bikes are allowed.

Outside of the central area the main streets are lined with the legendary tenements - the city's trademark 2 or 3 story residential buildings built from red or blonde sandstone which positively glow during the summer. The decline of Glasgow's economy during the mid to late 20th Century led to the mass construction of high-rise tower blocks and concrete housing estates during the 1960s and 1970s. The dramatic and striking Red Road Flats form the tallest residential property in Europe. Many 1970s office buildings in the centre have been cleared away by state-of-the-art glass structures as Glasgow's burgeoning financial services industry continues to grow.

You will notice, along with quite a few of his buildings to see in the city, including his magnum opus, the Glasgow School of Art, many other knock-offs and impersonations exist.

The Old Firm Derby is generally considered to be one of the best derby matches in the world, in terms of passion and atmosphere generated by both sets of fans, and is considered by many neutrals to be the most intense rivalry in all of Britain. The match itself is always highly anticipated and much talked about before and after. Cup (non-league) ties between these two giants are quite frequent, raising the tensions further. Be aware that getting tickets for \"Old Firm\" games can be difficult and cup ties near impossible.

There is nothing Glaswegians love more than \"putting the world right\" over a pint (or three), whether it‚Äôs the Old Firm, religion, weather, politics or how this year‚Äôs holidays went. You are guaranteed a warm welcome from the locals, who will soon strike up a conversation.\n\nThere are three (or arguably, four) basic drinking areas: these are also good for restaurants. First, there is the West End (the area around Byres Road and Ashton Lane), second there is the stretch of Sauchiehall Street between the end of the pedestrianised area (near Queen Street Station) and Charing Cross (and the various streets off this area).  Thirdly there is the Merchant City,  which is near Strathclyde University's campus. This is the most 'upmarket' area to drink and eat in, although it still has numerous student dives: start at the University of Strathclyde and wander down towards the Trongate (the West part of this part of town is the gay area). Finally, and up and coming, is the South Side (i.e. South of the Clyde). This used to be very much 'behind the times' socially speaking, but the relocation of the BBC to the South Side and the whole area generally moving 'upmarket' has improved things greatly. Try the area round Shawlands Cross for restaurants, bars, and The Shed nightclub.  There are also several hidden gems in and around the Blythswood Square area and the streets between Hope Street and Charing Cross: this being the city's business district however it can feel quite deserted on evenings and weekends.\n\nBe warned though about dress codes, particularly in some of the more upmarket establishments in the city centre and West End: sportswear and trainers (sneakers) are often banned, and some door staff are notoriously \"selective\" about who is allowed. If confronted with this, go elsewhere. The general \"boozer\" type pubs have no dress codes, but football shirts are almost universally banned in all: particularly on weekends. One rule to be aware of is that some clubs and upmarket pubs enforce an unwritten policy of not allowing all-male groups of more than about four people. For this reason, it may be advisable to split into groups of two or three. Some pubs in Glasgow are also exclusively the haunt of Old Firm football fans: again, these will be very crowded on football days, can get very rowdy, and should be avoided. Fortunately they are easy to spot; for example, a large cluster of Celtic-oriented pubs exist in the Barrowlands area, while one or two bars on or near Paisley Road West are favourite haunts of Rangers fans.\n\nThe following is merely a selection of the many bars, pubs, wine bars and clubs throughout the city.\n\nAn increasingly popular pastime in the city is the 'Subcrawl', a pub crawl round Glasgow's underground system, getting off at each of the fifteen stops to go to the nearest pub for a drink. It is advisable to go with a local especially since in some parts on the south side the nearest pub to the underground station is not immediately obvious, but it is a good way to see the different neighbourhoods and pub cultures of the city.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Chain\/Theme"]},"\n\nLike any major British city, the central area of Glasgow has its fair share of chain and theme  pubs, with establishments from the likes of Whitbread, Yates and of course the ubiquitous JD Wetherspoon:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["The Counting House"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["George Square ‚Äì near Queen Street station"]},") formerly a flagship branch of the Bank of Scotland, you can drink here in the splendour of this old Victorian banking hall.

The centre of Glasgow is safe and you should not encounter any problems. All of the city centre and tourist areas are well policed. During the day, the City Centre also has many 'information officers' in red hats and jackets who should be able to assist you if needed. Despite what its local reputation may be, being a Western European city, Glasgow ranks among one of the safest cities in the world. Glasgow does indeed have some very dangerous areas - particularly in some northern and eastern suburbs - where drug related crime for instance is rife, but these are well away from the centre and you would be unlikely to venture into them unless you were making a conscious effort to do so.\n\nCrime in the city centre is usually limited to drunken and rowdy behaviour late in the evenings - hotspots include the southern end of Hope Street next to Central Station, and under the 'Heilanman's Umbrella', the railway bridge over Argyle St adjacent to Central Station; and the western end of Sauchiehall St which have large concentrations of bars and nightclubs. There is usually a heavy police presence anyway in these areas on Friday and Saturday nights to defuse any problems. The West End fares better, but be aware that the back streets off Byres Road and around the University can quickly disorientate a stranger unfamiliar with the area in the hours of darkness.\n\nAlthough you'll see it being worn everywhere by the locals, if you buy any piece of Celtic or Rangers-related clothing as a souvenir, be wary of wearing it in public as it can lead to confrontation - particularly in the evenings. Most bars and clubs in the centre of the city universally ban all football colours, regardless of team.\n\nWhereas prostitution and other sex work is legal in Scotland, 'soliciting' (i.e. prostitutes soliciting for business in the street), 'kerb crawling' (that is 'punters' driving or walking around obviously looking for sex workers) are both illegal, so avoid driving or walking around obvious red light district. The main trouble spots in the city have historically been the Blythswood Hill and Anderston areas close to the M8 motorway - a busy office district by day, but usually otherwise deserted in the evenings and on weekends. 'Running a brothel' is also illegal, so 'massage parlours' and brothels can be and are 'busted' by the police. If you are in a brothel\/'massage parlour' which is raided by the police you may be taken into custody and asked questions you don't want to answer.\n\nPolice Scotland, the new Scotland-wide police force, has a ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.scotland.police.uk\/keep-safe\/safety-advice-jj\/out-and-about\/travel-safe\/ \"Travel Safe\" guide"]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\n\nThe UK's ",{"type":"'''","value":["National Health Service"]}," (NHS) will provide emergency treatment for anyone in the UK, irrespective of whether they reside in the UK.
