Sit on the left of the train for the best views down the loch and towards the Monument.\n\nA single from Fort William to Glenfinnan is £5.10, and a day return is £6. If you have a Highland Railcard (for people who live in the Highlands only, £7.50 for one year, gives you 50% off all Highland rail travel), it's £2.55 single, and a day return £3.

The bus company is called Shiel Buses, whose base is in Acharacle. They do other routes to Kilchoan and a local route for the Mallaig area. Buses leave Fort William 3-4 times a day, Monday to Saturday. A single to Glenfinnan is £2.70, a day return £3.50.\n\nCheck for timetables: ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.shielbuses.co.uk\/timetables.htm"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nGlenfinnan is a small village and it is possible to walk everywhere. There is a track that runs from the top of the village to the bottom, named the back track. It has a foot bridge in the middle and is therefore only accessible by foot. There is now a pavement on the main road from the very top of the village at Tor An Eas, to the bottom, at the National Trust for Scotland.\n\nCar Parks: National Trust for Scotland (for a small daily fee), the car park at the bottom of the glen (turn right instead of left into the village at the cross roads), and both hotels also have their own car parks.\n\nThe train station is at the top of the village, with the main bus stop's at the station road entrance (beside the red phone box) or at the cross roads at the bottom of the village.

This feat is marked by the monument, which stands by the beach. The monument itself is our own leaning tower of Pisa, as it has slowly been sinking into the sand for years now. It is not dangerous though, as it is hardly noticeable except to the best eye!\n\nThe Games are held on the large field on the left hand side as you enter into the village from the Fort William direction. The games go on from morning until night and in the afternoon there is the famous hill race! After 5PM there is usually better craic in the beer tent than anywhere else and later that evening there is the Games Dance.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Glenfinnan Fun Day"]},"\n\nGlenfinnan Fun Day is held in June every year on the lawn of Glenfinnan House Hotel. The day begins with a raft race from the Monument to the old pier at the hotel. The raft race began as an original charity event four years ago and has progressed from there. All entries welcome, life jackets must be worn and parent supervision is necessary. Last years winners were four children on a blow up bouncy castle!\n\nThe day progresses on the lawn with the entire village turning up for fresh food (local cuisine such as venison and fresh salmon on an open BBQ), games and slides for the children (and the adults). There is usually a raffle to raise funds for village activities (such as parties for the children at Christmas). There is no entry fee although all villagers are asked to contribute to the salads, drinks and raffle prizes available.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Walks"]},"\n\nGlenfinnan is in an area of hills, loch and beautiful scenery. Here are a few recommended walks:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The Village Walk"]},"\nYou can either begin at the top of the village at the station, or start at the bottom and end up there.\nFrom the red phone box on the main road: Head towards the top of the village, but take the first right down a bumpy track. This is the \"backtrack\". Follow the path down and across the foot bridge. When you reach the tarmac road, turn right and follow the road to the pier. At the pier, take the shore path to the left, and you will end up at the Glenfinnan House Hotel. Walk across the front of the lawn, and you will find yourself upon the road again. Straight across the road, there is a footpath leading up to the church. You will have to cross someone's drive to carry on here. At the church there is a fantastic view of the loch. At the church car park, and the main road, you can either take a right down to the bottom of the village and the glen, or take a left to take you back to the top of the village. The main road in the village is single track and has some beautiful little beaches if you just step off the road.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The Loch Path"]},"\nAt the National Trust for Scotland museum\/cafe, there is a path down to the monument. Just off that path to the left, there is a wooden trail around the edge of Loch Shiel which crosses over the old road and over a bridge to the other side of the loch. From here there are view points and a choice to either go left to Callop (where there is another car park and another glen) or to the right and Polloch. Polloch is a long walk, but you can make your way down the track a little bit for lovely views of the island and towards the village.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The Glen"]},"\nYou can park your car at the bottom of the glen as driving is restricted to residents of the glen only. Walk as far as you like. There are view points further up the glen, plus this is a good way to get a close up of the Glenfinnan Viaduct, used for films such as Charlotte Gray and Harry Potter. The Glen road is tarmac up until the bothy, which is about 4 miles walk. The road follows the river, in which you can swim in summer.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Swim"]},"\n\nFor you brave ones out there, there are a few good places to swim in summer. \nThe loch (the bay just off the single track road as you enter the village at the bottom) is an excellent place to swim. Although slightly shallow and rocky at the beginning, it soon widens out to a completely sandy bottom and plenty of space to swim. People have been known to swim to the island and back!\nRiver Finnan, up the glen, is a good place for privacy though. The further you go, the better the pools.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\nGlenfinnan has no grocery shops (nearest: Corpach, 12 miles in the direction of Fort William), clubs or bank machines, although many places do accept credit cards as payment.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["There is a shop at the National Trust for Scotland, selling souvenirs, books, post cards and other miscellaneous items.
