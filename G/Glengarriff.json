Follow in the footsteps of Wordsworth, Thackeray and GB Shaw and discover the magic of this natural treasure where sea, river and ancient forest meet.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe easiest way to get to Glengarriff is by road. Glengarriff is on the Ring of Beara and depending on your starting point you will probably either approach it on the N71, from Bantry (coming from the Cork side) or from Kenmare (coming from the Kerry side), or the R572 (coming from Castletownbere).\n\nIf you have your own boat, the most spectacular way to get to Glengarriff is by sea. Glengarriff Harbour is one of the most spectacular natural harbours in West Cork and has very safe anchorage.\n\nGlengarriff is served by the Bus Eireann Cork-Castletownbere bus service (Route 236), which leaves from the Parnell Square Bus Depot in Cork and passes through Bandon and Bantry. During the summer months, there is a bus service from Cork to Tralee (Route 252), which passes through Clonakilty, Skibbereen, Bantry and Glengarriff, before squeezing through the tunnel on the Caha Pass on its way through Kenmare and Killarney to Tralee.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nYou really need a car to get around the area (although Glengarriff itself is very compact and can easily be walked).

The island was purchased from the War Office in 1910 by Annan Bryce, who commissioned English architect Harold Peto to design a house and garden. Thousands of tons of topsoil were imported to the then bare, rocky island and shelter belts were planted, creating a micro-climate in which a number of tender plants thrive. The house was never built, and the Casita and Italian garden remain the centrepiece of the gardens. There are also very fine herbaceous borders.  \n\nThe gardens are now maintained by the Office of Public Works. Open March to October: Monday - Saturday 10:00 - 16:30 Sundays 13:00 - 17:00.
