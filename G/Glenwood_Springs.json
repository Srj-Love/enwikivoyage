The two rivers shape the town. They provide world-class fly-fishing, whitewater rafting, and now kayaking.\n\nOriginally named Defiance, in the late 1800s, the name was changed by white men arrived from an ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Iowa"]]}," town called ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Glenwood"]]},".  Many of the nearby towns (Aspen and Leadville) had their booms while Glenwood Springs was yet in its infancy.  Glenwood Springs was difficult to reach due to the canyons to the east and west; it was also located on Ute land. The town grew in part thanks to its location on the railroad and the Colorado River.\n\nThe local area is surrounded by public lands, especially the White River National Forest, which attracts hunters and campers from great distance. The Grand Mesa is to the west and the Flattops Wilderness area dominate to the North.  The  Flattops is a very large area offering unlimited high-country exploring.  The Four Mile recreation area (to the South-west)offers easier day mountain access favored by locals. Glenwood Springs is a truly great place to access all the Rocky Mountains have to offer.\n\nIn terms of Culture (and ski-appeal) it is hard to overestimate the role of Aspen.  Glenwood Springians may not want to actually live in Aspen, but they do appreciate being able to commute to a cultural mecca.  \n\nUp the valley is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Carbondale (Colorado)"],["Carbondale"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Basalt"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Snowmass"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Aspen"]]},".
