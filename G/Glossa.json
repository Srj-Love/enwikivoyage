It gazes across the sparkling Mediterranean sea to Skiathos and down to the peaceful harbour of Loutraki.  Glossa is still an area that appears to have not yet been discovered by mass-tourism and with it’s steep cobbled alley-ways, flanked by traditional houses, trailing bougainvillea and firmly-adhered-to siesta, you will delight in this truly Greek experience.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Climate"]},"\nThe temperature is slightly cooler in Glossa than in Skopelos town due to its hillside location.
