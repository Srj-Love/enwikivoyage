It also lies at the start of two of the most infamous Pennine passes, the Snake and Woodhead passes. Its main development is owed to the 19th-century cotton industry which generated the wealth to build much of the town we see today, although the cotton industry has since declined and almost disappeared from the region. Despite this, the historic mill buildings still dominate the town, such as those at Wren Nest and Howardtown, both of which are undergoing major transformations into new multi-use buildings including retail, leisure and residential. \n\nGlossop is predominantly a commuter town for the nearby conurbation of Greater Manchester, where quite often people have moved to enjoy a more relaxed and laid-back quality of life whilst enjoying the benefits of living near a city. It has a regular market, the usual range of high street chain stores and some independent shops. It attracts tourists mainly due to its good transport links with the surrounding Peak District National Park and its stunning countryside, though the town itself is not without interest and parts (e.g. Manor Park, Old Glossop) are quite attractive. It is not of any administrative significance due to its geographic location and local government structures. The population of the town (2001 Census) is 32,428.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Derbyshire map.png"],["thumb"],["right"],["Map of Derbyshire showing the geographical location of Glossop within Derbyshire"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Glossop Station - geograph.org.uk - 1089828.jpg"],["thumb"],["left"],["Glossop station"]]},"\nThere are trains from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Manchester"]]}," Piccadilly Station every 30 minutes and seven days a week.\nThe stations on the line are as follows:\n",{"type":"*","value":["Hadfield"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Glossop"]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":["Dinting"]},{"type":"*","value":["Broadbottom"]},{"type":"*","value":["Hattersley"]},{"type":"*","value":["Godley"]},{"type":"*","value":["Newton (for Hyde) - Connections: Hyde by bus or a 15-minute walk"]},{"type":"*","value":["Flowery Field"]},{"type":"*","value":["Guide Bridge - Connections: ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ashton-under-Lyne"]]}," by bus"]},{"type":"*","value":["Gorton"]},{"type":"*","value":["Ashburys - Connections: walk or bus to Eastlands\/Manchester City FC"]},{"type":"*","value":["Ardwick - only 1 train Mon–Fri stops"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Manchester"]]}," Piccadilly"]},"At peak periods the trains may stop at the following stops in a different order (i.e. Glossop–Hadfield–Dinting).\nThis rail service is operated by Northern Rail; the journey between Glossop and Manchester Piccadilly is around 30 minutes, but journey times may vary at peak periods.
