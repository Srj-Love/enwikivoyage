It inspired the old English nursery rhyme:\n\n:\"Dr Foster went to Gloucester in a shower of rain.\n:He stepped in a puddle,\n:Right up to his middle,\n:And never went back again.\"\n\n'Dick Whittington', born around 1350, a well-known character through the pantomime story, has connections with Gloucester. The story is based on the real life Richard Whittington, who, unlike his pantomime character, was not poor, being the third son of Sir William Whittington of Gloucester. The traditional tale has a 'poor' Dick going to London to seek his fortune, but he eventually becomes Lord Mayor of London.\n\nA traditional rhyme is associated with this episode, as follows:\n\n\"Turn again, Whittington,\nOnce Mayor of London,\nTurn again, Whittington,\nTwice Mayor of London,\nTurn again, Whittington,\nThrice Mayor of London!\"\n\nThe city is also known for 'The Tailor of Gloucester', a children's novel by Beatrix Potter that was first published in 1903. It is traditionally read to children on Christmas Eve, just before bedtime.\n\nIt was a main Roman city, 'Glevum'—Roman tunnels and fortifications exist underneath the city centre and can be visited through the museum.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Language"]},"\n\nAs a provincial British town, you will almost certainly need to be able to speak English to get around in Gloucester. There is a sizable immigrant population in Gloucester from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Poland and the Czech Republic and so you may have more luck with these people should you speak one of their languages. Gloucester also has a large (for the region) black (mainly of Caribbean origin) community.\n\nThe Tourist Information Office has literature in most major languages, including Japanese.\n\nGenerally, the Gloucester accent is clear to understand and isn't peppered with dialect terms. However, understandably for the area, there is a West Country 'burr'and tourists whose experience of English accents is limited to either Cockney or Queen's English may notice this. The 'burr' becomes more pronounced more westerly, in nearby Forest of Dean,\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nGloucester is well serviced by the motorway system and can easily be accessed by junctions 11, 11a and 12 on the M5.

Because Gloucester was a major Roman City, it has very good A road connections throughout Gloucestershire and the Cotswolds.\n\nGloucester has good railway connections (Platform 1\/3 at Gloucester is Europe's longest) and has daily direct connections to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cardiff"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bristol"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Birmingham (England)"],["Birmingham"]]},".  Nearby ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cheltenham"]]}," has more stopping trains, so it may be necessary to get a train to Cheltenham and change trains for Gloucester.  Trains between Cheltenham and Gloucester operate every half hour and take around 10 minutes.\n\nNearby Staverton hosts Gloucestershire Airport, which has regular flights to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jersey"]]},".  There are also many private aircraft there, which can be chartered.\n\nGloucester is a large hub for buses and coaches and there is a large coach station where there are regular coaches (mainly operated by National Express) to all major airports and cities (there are several coaches to and from London daily) in the UK. A Megabus service to and from London also operates from outside the bus station.\n\nGloucester originally built up around the River Severn.  It has a sailing heritage.  It is possible to visit Gloucester via river or the Gloucester Sharpness Canal via boat.\n\nA park and ride service is available see, National Park and Ride Directory ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.parkandride.net\/gloucester\/gloucester_frameset.shtml"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nStagecoach operates most of the local bus services, from both, and between Gloucester and Cheltenham.  But there are many bus services to the Forest of Dean, South Wales, Gloucestershire, The South West and The Midlands.\n\nThere are several cycle routes around Gloucester and it is possible to have a fairly stress-free cycle ride around the city and its suburbs.  There are also cycle routes to both Cheltenham and even to Bristol.\n\nThe Centre of Gloucester is quite compact and flat so you can easily walk around it.\n\nThe best way to get to the countryside around Gloucester is by car.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Gloucester Cathedral"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.gloucestercathedral.org.uk\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=A cathedral in which part of the Harry Potter films were filmed."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The historical 18th century ",{"type":"'''","value":["docks"]}," – a popular tourist attraction, with numerous museums and shops\/pubs."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Baker's Jewellers"]}," on Southgate Street is one of the most unusual 'action' timeclocks you are likely to see in a city centre.
