The hiking is easy and safe.  Hiking to the edge of the \"bowl\" provides opportunities to rock climb.  Safety gear isn't necessary if you don't climb too high.  You'll fall into sand if you do fall.  This is an easy hike for kids.  The most challenging aspect of playing at Goblin Valley is climbing out of the hole.  The ramp is long and the grade isn't terribly steep, but those less than fit will have to stop and rest half way up.  There are latrine type toilets and a pavilion with picnic tables.\n\nGoblin Valley State Park was the filming location for an alien planet in the 1999 film \"Galaxy Quest\". \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\nThere is a 7$ fee \/ car.
