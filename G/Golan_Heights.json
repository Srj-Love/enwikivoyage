The remainder is under Syrian control. Following the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Israel returned another 5% of the land to Syria. Israel subsequently began building settlements in the area, and granted the Syrian Druze inhabitants permanent residency status. In 1981, Israel annexed the Golan Heights, a move unrecognized and condemned internationally.\n\nUnlike other territories occupied by Israel, the part of the Golan Heights controlled by Israel is considered part of the country by most Israelis and officially by the Israeli government. Security is on par with Israel proper, and you won't find roadblocks or the abject poverty or crumbling infrastructure you'd find in other occupied territories.\n\nIn Israel, it is generally understood that the Golan Heights will not be returned to Syria. The Israeli viewpoint is that this would not be feasible due to economical and political reasons, and for reasons of security which they believe have only strengthened since the Syrian civil war started. There are no negotiations between Israel and Syria and this not likely to change any time soon, though one never knows what the future will bring. But as it stands, even some leftist Israeli political parties which fiercely advocated the return of the Golan in the past no longer support this position or have since muted their rhetoric. Needless to say, the Syrian viewpoint is very different, but for the time being, the border is quiet and visitors to the Israeli-controlled side need not have any overriding security concerns.\n\nThe de facto Israel-Syria border runs through the Golan Heights along an area known as the Purple Line. This line is patrolled by a United Nations peacekeeping force. No one is allowed to cross the border without special permission, though there is a UN-operated border crossing.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nHebrew is spoken among the Jewish inhabitants in the towns and kibbutzim.
