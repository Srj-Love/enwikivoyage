Well of course there's the coast. The stretch of US 101 between Gold Beach and Brookings to the south is considered one of the most \"oooooohhh!\" and \"wow!\" scenic drives in the state, and one that’s usually less trafficked than up north. Look for waysides; there are lots of picnic spots and hiking trails.  But turn off the highway and you’ll find as much to be amazed by. Considered one of the most beautiful is Floras Lake County Park, off US 101 just north Port Orford. While you’re up here, check out nearby Cape Blanco State Park, the westernmost point in the continental United States, and the Elk River, also marked along US 101.  Closer is the Lower Rogue River Highway, County Road 595, that takes you up and into the hills east of Gold Beach.  A good map and recommendations from locals is your best bet when in town, because the drives vary with the season. Ask about azalea blooms and spring iris fields.

For many people, storms are fascinating, and many visitors come to the coast during the winter to observe the forces of nature strike the coast with high winds and horizontal volleys of rain.  But whether you park at the water's edge or watch from an ocean or river front room, the raging surf is an experience you won't soon forget.  Weather in Gold Beach is spectacular, dramatic, and unpredictable.  Storm watching doesn't necessarily mean pulling on rain gear and leaning into 60 MPH winds.  In fact, huge waves created by swells from storms still out at sea precede the actual storm.  The sun can be shining and the wind only a calm breeze as you watch heavy surf crash into a headland, cape or jetty. The result?  The airborne mist and cream-like froth cascade over the rocks, leaving you mesmerized.  The months of November through February bring the biggest surf, and the most excitement for storm watchers.  Thankfully, there are many overlooks, viewpoints and state parks north and south of Gold Beach on Highway 101 that are excellent locations to begin your winter storm watching adventures."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Winter at the beach"]},".  Outdoor activities:  Winter season is a great time to be on the southern Oregon coast.  Beachcombing is actually best when turmultuous seas deposit a variety of treasures on local beaches.  Luckily, Gold Beach enjoys a very temperate climate that allows for outdoor activities even in mid-winter, and it's not unusual to have a major wind or rainstorm followed by a series of warm, bright and sunny days, with blue skies chasing the clouds away. Actually, the possibilities are almost endless when it comes to winter-time activities:  Whale watch, storm watch, beachcomb, hike, crab and ride horses.  Of course, whale and storm watching can also be enjoyed in the comfort of your room or vehicle.  Indoor activities:  From a cozy river or oceanfront room, you can snuggle up to a fire, relax in a hot tub, read a book or sip piping-hot cup of coffee.  When you venture out, enjoy a fresh Dungeness crab and other delicacies at local eateries.  Then, wander through the several art galleries and gift shops in town."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Art galleries and artists"]},".  The town is home to several local artists, and some of them even open their studio doors to visitors while they’re working. Oils, watercolors, photography, jewelry and sculpture inspired by the local resources and scenery — or just plain inspired — may be the perfect memento to take home. Ever wanted to take an art class?  Many of our well recognized local artists make arrangements for instruction and hold workshops.  Be sure to skroll down below for links and contact information.

Rent a crab ring at The Rogue Outdoor Store and follow the directions of your friendly crabber and tonight you'll dine in style.

The Gold Beach Quilters and their friends from all over Curry County created this quilt.  The machine quilting for this project was done by Shelley Knapp of Brookings, making this work of love a true Curry County quilt.  It is a “must see” and is a very coveted item for those who have bought tickets.  A free Basics of Quilting class will be offered during the Quilt Show on Saturday from 11:30 AM to 1:30 PM.  Participants will complete a quilted potholder to take home.  Please bring a working sewing machine with needle, scissors to cut thread, two fat quarters (18” by 20”) of coordinating colors, neutral colored thread, and a needle for hand sewing .

The restricted Ocean recreational salmon fishing will have no effect on the Rogue River.  Consequently, salmon fishing at the mouth of the Rogue may be improved as a result.  And there's ocean fishing for lots of other fish!  Anyone can toss out a line on a sunny summer day, but winter brings out the real anglers, especially for steelhead -one of the sport's great challenges.  December through March is one of the locals' favorite times of the year, because Gold Beach typically has multiple days of sunshine and mild weather.  Steelhead fishing reaches its peak in February, with opportunities to cast in as many as five rivers within a five-minute to one-hour drive from the center of town.  Steelhead are sea-run rainbow trout that range in size up to 20 pounds; average is 4 to 8 pounds.  You can fish in a variety of ways depending on the river and conditions, and can cover up to 12 miles of river a day.  How does a covered, heated 21-foot powerboat sound?  Or an open drift boat with heater?  These vessels carry two to four people, depending on conditions and fishing method; guides, boats, licenses and tackle are available in Gold Beach.  If you don't want to drift up, you can drive upstream; locals can point out public river access spots for good fishing.  Now the Ocean is a different kettle of fish altogether - lingcod and rockfish at this time of year.  And Gold Beach offers the best ocean bottom fishing opportunities on the Oregon Coast.  It's done just a few miles offshore in 40 to 125 feet of water, with great catches of excellent-eating seafood.  If you're looking to charter a boat in the winter, it's best to call ahead (see fishing search below), because weather definitely affects accessibility for safety reasons, current conditions and anglers' preferences.  Ocean charters can be arranged for parties of two or more."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Jet Boat Tours"]},".  Gold Beach is synonymous with jet boats and is the gateway to the Wild & Scenic portion of the Rogue River. Departing from Gold Beach is the only way to get jet boat access to this pristine \"Wild Section.\" The trips are considered a must-do during any Gold Beach visit — at least in the months between May and October. Two outfits run the boats up the Wild and Scenic Rogue River on trips of 64, 80 and 104 round-trip miles, the longer, the wilder — in terms of whitewater and scenery. Excursions include lunch or dinner stopovers at upriver lodges (meal price extra).  Jet boats are designed specifically for safely navigating strong currents and shallow riffles, so you can relax as trained pilots treat you to tall tales and river lore, incredible scenery and sightings of black bear, river otters, eagles and the rare mountain lion.  Mail Boat Hydro-Jets is a descendant of the original mail boats that have carried news and parcels from the outside world to settlers upriver since 1895. Mail Boat Hydro-Jets runs trips in open vessels and in the Rogue Queen, a glass-enclosed excursion boat that’s ideal for rainy days and perfect for tour groups and champagne cruises.  An adventure with Jerry’s Rogue Jets begins in their museum, where just about anything you need to know about the area’s colorful history is on display in photos, artifacts and dioramas. Then get on board to learn the true meaning of \"wild and scenic\" from folks who’ve run these trips since 1958.  Reservations are highly recommended for both outfitters, though same-day openings are available if you’re lucky. Overnight stays at lodges upriver are another option; check out their websites, above, for details."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Wine Art & Music Festival"]},".  14-15 May 2011, Event Center on the Beach, Hwy 101.

Whether your interest is fine art, wine tasting, experiencing gourmet treats or gazing out over the majestic Pacific Ocean, the 24th Annual Art, Wine and Music Festival hosted by America’s Wild Rivers Coast and Gold Beach Chamber of Commerce is the place to be.  This year’s event will once again be held at the Event Center on the Beach in Gold Beach, just a short walk away from one of Oregon’s finest beaches.  The two-day event, scheduled for May 14 and 15, promises to be better than ever.  Wine connoisseurs know that Oregon is producing some of the finest wines in the country, many of them from the Umpqua Valley.  The exciting news is that sixteen of them will be showcased for your tasting at this venue.  One admission ticket is good for the entire two-day venue.  You may need all that time to fully experience everything the venue has to offer.  Come early and take your time visiting with each winery representative. Be sure to ask Henry Estate Winery about their practice of holding back wines from market for as many as two years longer than most other wineries to ensure the proper balance and character known as their signature.  At River’s Edge Winery, ask about their low-tech, hands-on approach utilizing small batch fermentation and barrel aging.  Participating wineries have fascinating histories and stories to tell.  After tasting, grab your favorite glass of wine and browse through the many art displays offered by some of the finest galleries and artists in the region.  Or, just sit and relax and enjoy the music.  Not into wines?  For the fourth year in a row, the Brew Pub will be open on the second level of the Docia Sweet building featuring special brews from the Mad River Brewing Company, live music will be available in the courtyard for your listening pleasure and the Garden Club Floral Show will be joining the lineup of fun and interesting events added to the festival."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nThink of downtown Gold Beach as the anti-mall.
