It sits at the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, and distance-wise is roughly halfway between the cities of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boulder"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Denver"]]},". It is the home of the Coors Brewery, the Colorado School of Mines, and the Colorado Railroad Museum.\n\nThe city of Golden has a distinct country-western atmosphere due in part to its gold-mining history and in part to its proximity to the front range. A slogan often used to describe the city claims that it's \"Where The West Lives\". Also, an iconic, antique signboard draped over Golden's Main Street ushers in travelers with \"Howdy Folks! Welcome To Golden\".\n\nIn keeping with the general spirit of the Rockies, Golden is an outdoor, active town. It's not unusual to see kayakers lugging boats around town and playing in the mile long whitewater course that runs through town, or mountain bikers returning from a ride up to the surrounding hills. \n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nGolden is a tourist town in summer and a college town the rest of the year. The Colorado School of Mines is ranked one of the best schools in the country.\n\nGolden is not between Boulder and Denver.  It is west of Denver and south of Boulder.  There are other cities between Golden and Denver, e.g. Lakewood and Wheat Ridge.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.flydenver.com\/ Denver International Airport"]}]},", (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["DEN"]]},") is the closest major airport, 35 miles east of Golden.

From Boulder, take Highway 93 south approximately 25 miles to Golden.  From Denver, head west on Highway 6 or on Colfax Avenue to Golden.  From north Denver\/Westminster\/Arvada\/Northglenn\/etc., take Interstate 76 west, which merges with Interstate 70 west (an alternative), and exit onto Highway 58, which takes you directly into Golden.  Golden can also be reached from south Denver\/Littleton\/Highlands Ranch\/Parker by taking C-470 west directly to Golden.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nThere is no long-distance bus service directly to Golden.

Routes 44\/44L also serve downtown via an indirect route.  Fare is $2.25.\n\nRoute GS offers express service to and from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boulder"]]},", weekdays only.  Check the schedule in advance, as there aren't very many trips and they're spaced unevenly.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nDowntown Golden consists of a strip of businesses surrounded by residential neighborhoods. This commercial and business portion of Golden is relatively small, and can be driven or biked through, or even covered by foot, in a short amount of time. In fact, Golden is very alternative-transportation friendly, and groups of walkers or bikers are always seen moving through town.  The downtown area is an active hub for area residents.  Numerous events are sponsored there throughout the year.  One of these is a weekly Friday night street party with music and local restaurants selling tapas and beverages.  In August the city sponsors a popular fine arts festival.  In 2012 professional cyclists will, for the second consecutive year, begin a day of racing in the middle of town.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Buffalo Bill's Museum and Grave"],["url=http:\/\/www.buffalobill.org\/"],["email="],["address=987 Lookout Mountain Rd"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 303 526-0744"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Astor House Museum"],["url=http:\/\/goldenhistorymuseums.org\/astorhousemuseum.php"],["email="],["address=822 12th St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 303 278-3557"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Clear Creek History Mueseum"],["url=http:\/\/www.goldenhistorymuseums.org\/clearcreekpark.php"],["email="],["address=822 12th St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 303 278-3557"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Colorado School of Mines campus"],["url=http:\/\/mines.edu\/"],["email="],["address=Elm St. south of 19th St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Each building on the compact Mines campus was considered modern architectural design when built, giving the campus as a whole a wide range of styles tied together by the use of the same sandy-colored stone for most façades."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Colorado Railroad Museum depot building.JPG"],["thumbnail"],["250px"],["Colorado Railroad Museum"]]},"\nActivities in Golden are usually split between visiting its historical sites including the Coors Brewery, and doing outdoors activities such as rock climbing, mountain biking, and hiking.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Coors Brewery"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.coors.com"],["email="],["address=13th & Ford Streets"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 303 277-BEER"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content= Tours operate M-Sa 10AM-4PM; guests over 21 y.o. offered limited free samples, guests under 18 y.o. must be accompanied by an adult.
