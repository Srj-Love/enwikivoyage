In the earliest days of Ontario, the area was dotted with small towns and villages that served the vast farmland throughout Southern Ontario. In the second half of the twentieth century, rapid population and economic growth around Toronto and affordable car transport led industry and residents to move further into the country; towns and farmland were developed into residential suburbs, shopping centres, and business parks, all connected by a new network of roads and highways. \n\nExcept for the oldest suburbs, the majority of suburban neighbourhoods were developed for the car, and can thus be a considerable distance from the employment or entertainment centres. Often, the 'main street' of the pre-existing towns will be preserved and will be distinct from the newer residential areas. However, it is no longer necessarily the hub of the surrounding area; most locals will do day-to-day shopping and errands at larger retail plazas and shopping malls. Every suburban town and city has at least a few places worth seeing, including unique restaurants and popular attractions, but more planning could be required to make good use of time while exploring suburban areas.\n\nIf you're willing to spend an hour or two driving, the Golden Horseshoe area offers many opportunities for day and weekend trips year-round that suit every interest; there are very few things that you won't be able to buy or do at somewhere in this region.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By plane "]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Toronto Pearson International Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["YYZ"]]},") ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.torontopearson.com"]}," is located in Mississauga about 30-50 minutes by car from downtown Toronto and is serviced by most major international carriers. \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["John C.

Highways and roads are well maintained, and well marked by directional signage to cities, connecting routes, and major attractions.\n\nIntercity and commuter rail and bus is a reliable option for getting around, but most routes are oriented through Toronto, and a connection will most likely be necessary.\n\nMost cities and towns operate some public transit, and neighbouring transit systems will often connect at key terminals. Note, however, that local transit is not always an efficient way to travel across entire cities. Even services that run from one end of town to the other are primarily used to serve many streets and points en route.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Shaw Theatre"]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Niagara on the Lake"]]},".
