It is a major transport hub in India and is served by many international airlines with nonstop flights from most major European and Asian cities, as well as from New York and Chicago in the United States. It is well connected by air as well as rail with the rest of India.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drive"]},"\nThe easiest way to do this trip is to rent a car with a driver in Delhi.  Depending on the duration of the trip, a car with a driver will set you back about Rs. 8,000 ($150) to Rs. 15,000 ($300). Cars can be easily rented in Delhi (ask at your hotel or inquire online at a travel website like makemytrip.com) either for a flat fee up front or for a per day charge plus a per kilometer charge. You also need to take care of the driver, about $50 for each meal and most tourist hotels will provide dormitory accommodation and food for drivers for a small fee ($100 - $200).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Rail"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Bus"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineitinerary"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Golden Triangle (India)"]]}]
