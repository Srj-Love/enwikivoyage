Despite the regions seeming harshness and remoteness from Perth, many Goldfieds-Esperance towns were some of the earliest to be settled in the fledgling colony. Esperance was settled in 1863 for agriculture and Coolgardie spring up almost overnight when gold was discovered and was the third largest town in the colony by 1892. The gold rush of the late 1800s gave birth to many towns that flourished and faded when the gold ran out. Some such as Kanowna, Dundas and Niagara disappeared back into the dirt leaving little more broken bottles and rusting wire to signify their existence, while others manage to hang on in a greatly diminished form. \n\nFor residents and travellers alike, the Goldfields-Esperance region is generally thought of as having two halves; northern and southern, demarcated with an imaginary line at Kalgoorlie. The northern is typified by desert landscapes dominated by mining, the southern sees trees and green farmland right up to granite bound coast.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nBeing both inland and southern, the temperatures daytime vary widely. Summer months can see scorching temperatures exceeding 40°C while its not uncommon for the night to dip below 0°C. The coastal areas have particularly temperamental weather patterns with cold cloudy and warm sunny skies alternating throughout the day.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Towns"]},"\n\nIn the eastern Goldfields region of Western Australia, the idea of city, town or locality can be a problem. When you pass through some locations (on some maps they still show up as something significant) in many cases they might have been reduced to a single building. \n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Caiguna"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Coolgardie"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Esperance"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Kalgoorlie-Boulder"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Kambalda"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Leonora"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Menzies"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Norseman"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Cape Arid National Park"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Cape Le Grand National Park"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Fitzgerald River National Park"]]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Stokes National Park"]]}]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["From Perth"]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["By car"]},"\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Great Eastern Highway"]]}]}," is the most direct way to get to or from Kalgoorlie.\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["South Coast Highway"]]}]}," comes from the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South West (Western Australia)"],["South West"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["By plane"]},"\nSkywest airlines fly from Perth to both Kalgoorlie and Esperance, but not between them.
