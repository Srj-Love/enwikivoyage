The apparent object is to knock a small hard ball into a designated hole, using only a minimum number of blows of a stick or club, while avoiding the hazards of the terrain such as vegetation, water, soft ground and loose sand. While this may appear frustrating to some, the pleasure that so many people do derive from working out their frustrations in the course of this game means that golf and visiting the ",{"type":"''","value":["golf courses"]}," where the game is played is a significant ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Travel topics"],["reason for travel"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nGolf originated at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saint Andrews"]]},", in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Scotland"]]},". Because of this, Scotland, and in particular the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Old Course"]}," at St. Andrews, is considered the traditional home of Golf, and the standard to which all other Golf Courses are compared.\n\nGolf spread throughout the British Isles, and by 1829, beyond them with the establishment of the \"Royal Calcutta Golf Club\" in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["India"]]},". By the end of the 19th Centuary, Clubs in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ireland"]]},", The ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United States of America"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wales"]]}," had come together to organise the sport at their respective national levels. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Scotland"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["England"]]}," followed after the First World War. Golf has two global Governing Bodies, the \"R&A\" at St Andrew's, Scotland and the \"United States Golf Association\" which work closely in partnership, for example in agreeing to changes to the \"Rules of Golf\". This joint approach helps to ensure that golf has not suffered the fate of other sports and split between a \"British\" sport, (e.g. Soccer and Cricket) and an \"American\" analogue (e.g. American Football and Baseball). Golf is golf wherever you play in the world, with the same standard rules, which is particularly useful if you want to play the sport outside your own country.\n\nToday, perhaps one of the first two things that developers consider when wanting to attract more tourism to a destination is where to put the (next) golf course to go with the hotel they are wanting to develop.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Destinations "]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Europe"]]}," "]},"\nGolf as we understand it originated in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Scotland"]]},", although it is probable that ancestor games to modern golf originated on the Continent.

The Celtic countries, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Scotland"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ireland"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wales"]]},", in particular hit above their weight in terms of the courses they offer. This is due to the fact that their extensive coastlines offer ample opportunities to build links courses. Their larger neighbour ",{"type":"[[","value":[["England"]]}," also has many fine courses. The most famous course undoubtedly would be the Old Course at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["St Andrews"]]},".\n\nIberia offers also offers the second most important focus for European Golf. Golf courses have developed in both ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Spain"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Portugal"]]},", particularly in coastal areas. Valderama is probably the most famous of the continental courses the venue of the only European Ryder Cup held on Mainland Europe.\n\nOther destinations have also developed golf courses. In ",{"type":"[[","value":[["France"]]}," courses seem to be located disproportionately in the West of the country, in particular in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brittany"]]},". The ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Czech Republic"]]}," for example has seen new courses open since the fall of communism, and the Scandinavian countries offer the opportunity of around the clock golf during the summer months.\n\nIn the current economic climate due to the relative weakness of Sterling, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["England"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Northern Ireland"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Scotland"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wales"]]}," probably offer better value than Eurozone destinations.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Scotland"]]}," "]},"\n\nThe legendary home of golf and home to the one of the game's two co-governing bodies, the R&A.
