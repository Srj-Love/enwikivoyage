Not as well known, and certainly not as publicized, as more major arenas in the Texas Revolution, such as the Alamo and San Jacinto, Gonzales is where the first combat of the Revolution took place. Today, however, it is a small town of roughly 6000 people, where time moves at a much slower pace. Similar to most other towns in this part of Texas, Gonzales is unique because of its heritage and the various sites and events that celebrate this heritage.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nDriving is the only way into Gonzales. US Highway 183 runs north to south through the city, while US Highway 90 runs east to west. From Austin, take US Hwy 183 due south for about an hour. From San Antonio, follow I-10 east to exit 632(US 183 to Gonzales\/Cuero), and drive south on 183 for 15 miles to reach Gonzales. From Houston, follow I-10 west to exit 632, and drive south.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe same means used to get into Gonzales is the best means for getting around Gonzales.
