It's known for the wealth of its inhabitants, the broadcasting industry and its high property values. Many of its inhabitants are Dutch celebrities working in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hilversum"]]},", the \"media capital\" of the country and home to the largest television studios in Europe.\n\nSince the 17th century this area has been popular with rich traders from Amsterdam, who bought and built many vacation homes here. With the introduction of radio (and later television), broadcasting organizations set up shop in these luxury villas in and around Hilversum. It became a magnet for the rich and famous, most of whom currently live in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Laren"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Blaricum"]]},", two of the wealthiest municipalities of the country.\n\nA conversation with the average Dutchman about the region will probably bring up adjectives like \"arrogant\" and \"snobby\". The typical Gooi \"r\" is not rolled as it is in standard Dutch pronunciation. This is not a historical dialect, but a modern speech trait that was brought in during the 19th-century by rich newcomers. Many Dutch people don't like this speech pattern as it would show arrogance to the general populace, but it is influential among upper class citizens nonetheless. Another term that shows a negative association with the region is \"Gooi parking\" (",{"type":"''","value":["Gooisch parkeren"]},"), which is the casual parking of high-priced SUVs outside permitted parking places.\n\nUnlike most of the country, the Gooi area is located on a slightly hilly area with the soil based on sand. The landscape is characterized by forests and heathlands. An exception to this is the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wijdemeren"]]}," area, most of which consists of flat grasslands, polders and lakes. At hot summer days, many locals come here to sail their boat over the lakes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\nThe Gooi area is well-connected by the Netherlands Railways ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/ns.nl\/en"]}," service. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hilversum"]]}," is the largest city of the Gooi area and the best connected one, as it is the only Intercity station of the region (and six international trains from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Berlin"]]}," also stop in Hilversum every day). ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Weesp"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Naarden"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bussum"]]}," are also home to a railway station and can easily be visited with the so-called \"Sprinter\" trains.\n\nThe other areas do not have direct train connections, so you'd need to continue your route by bus. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wijdemeren"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Laren"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Blaricum"]]}," can be visited by bus from Hilversum (though it might be easier coming with your own transport).
