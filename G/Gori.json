Founded in the sixteenth century BC and carved out of rock, this was a bustling city over 3000 years ago and was, before the introduction of Christianity in the fourth century, a major regional center of Caucasian pagan worship. After Saint Nino converted King Mirian II of Iberia, the pagan temples of Uplistsikhe were sacked and the city went into long-term decline.  Its decline was hastened by devastation at the hands of the Mongols in the 12th century, although it remained inhabited, serving as a stop along the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Silk Road"]]}," until the 15th century.\n\nHighlights include: a Hellenistic amphitheater overlooking the Mtkvari river where residents of Uplistsikhe once enjoyed Greek-style performances, a functioning 9th century church built atop the ruins of an ancient pagan temple to the Caucasian sun god, a once pillared seat of kings, and a fun cave tunnel leading out of the city to the riverside.  Also be sure to note the round storage spaces once used for wheat and the shelf-like spaces for medicinal herbs—a veritable Bronze Age pharmacy!\n\nUplistsikhe is of considerable historical interest and is properly enjoyed with a guide.  Chances are good that your guide will find you before you ask (there is not much alternative employment in this area) and there is a good chance of finding an English-speaking guide on site. Be sure to negotiate prices with the guide though, and don't accept the first offer. Entry fee to the site is 3 lari (1 lari for children), the receptionist will try to sell you leaflets and books but don't fall for it as she is trying to rip you off. The guides sell the same books more cheaply.\n\nUplistsikhe suffered long years of neglect and vandalism and is currently undergoing significant restoration as a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["UNESCO World Heritage List"],["UNESCO World Heritage Site"]]},". Accordingly, certain areas may be closed off from direct contact during your visit, although all sites will still be viewable.\n\nIt should cost 10 lari to get a taxi one-way from Gori to the Uplistsikhe complex. Buses also go from Gori to Uplistsikhe village on the other side of the river, 700m from the Uplistsikhe complex. These run fairly frequently and cost 1 lari. The bus from Gori leaves from the bus station. Ask someone which minibus to get it (there was no English sign); someone in the ticket office guided me to it. Getting a bus back to Gori is very simple (just walk along the main street of the village until you see a group of people waiting by the road, just near the point where it meets another road).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Goris Tsikhe (Gori Castle)"]},"\n\nGoris Tsikhe stands at the heart of the city atop a large hill and is the only structure in town that could dwarf the Stalin statue.  According to locals, Goris Tsikhe's most notable moment in world history occurred in the first century BC, when it was conquered by the Roman General Pompeii. The current ruins are more recent, however, having been built after the Mongol invasion. There is not much to see inside the ruined castle's walls, but there are nice views of the city and the surrounding dark green plains of Shida Kartli. The approach to the ruins was recently repaved and the surrounding area cleaned up, but the site remains free and the only price of admission is the short, steep walk up the path.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Gori Jvari (Gori Cross)"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Gori cathedral (view from the Gori Fortress) (B).jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["A view of Gori Jvari from nearby mountain ridge"]]},"\n\nThe church at Gori Jvari stands on an outcropping of rocks and can be seen from practically anywhere in Gori. Originally built in the 12th century, it was burned down by the Turks, rebuilt, and destroyed again by an earthquake in 1920. The current church was built in the 1980s.  On days commemorating St. George (November 23 and April 23), Gori residents flock to the church with sacrificial sheep. The sheep are walked around the church three times, and in accordance with Orthodox tradition, are taken just off the church grounds for slaughter. On a clear day, the view of the Caucasus from the church is spectacular.\n\nThe moderate hike is approximately three hours round trip. To reach the trail head, walk south along Stalin Avenue until you cross the river. The road will cut to the right and then cross the railroad tracks. On the other side of the tracks, turn right then take the first left and then the windy path up the hill that is immediately on your right. This twists up the hill. If you find a graveyard on your left, you are going in the right direction.
