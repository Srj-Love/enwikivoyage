Strictly speaking Goring is in Oxfordshire and Streatley in Berkshire, but as everything in both villages is in reasonably easy walking distance of everything else it seems better to deal with them as one.\n\nThe two villages cluster around a bridge across the river Thames, with an adjacent lock and weir. Both villages have their fair share of quaint thatched cottages and pubs.\n\nWhat distinguishes these villages from many others on the river Thames is their location in the 'Goring Gap', a geological feature where, during the last ice age, the river forced its way between the Chiltern Hills and the Berkshire Downs. As a result the valley is much narrower, with some spectacular views from the tops of the surrounding hills.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nGoring has a rail station on the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Reading (England)"],["Reading"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oxford"]]}," line.
