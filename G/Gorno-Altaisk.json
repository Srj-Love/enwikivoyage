Most of organized tourist groups pass by the city since it is not on the routes to major destinations. However, there is a lot to see. \nThe city is located on the northern border of the Altai Republic in a valley of two rivers. Millions of years ago it was a lake here, but the feeding river Maima changed position and the lake disappeared. Ancient people started to settle here around a hundred thousand years ago.\nSprawled 10 kilometers from east to west and 7,5km from north to south, the city has 200 streets and pereouloks. The main ones are Kommunistichesky Prospekt, in parallel to Choros-Gurkina Prospekt and Lenina Prospekt. Kommunistichesky and Choros-Gurkina Prospekts are concentration of shops, cafes, banks, education and administrative buildings. Thanks to the number of institutes, the city is full of young students (over 5000) and the weekends are always some sort of holiday.
