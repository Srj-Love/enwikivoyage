In 1921, an area of 1,000 square kilometres, and later extended to 3, 200 square kilometres, was officially proclaimed Game Reserve in 1935. Between 1935 and 1960, the year it attained is actual status, the Park took various shapes and sizes with the maximum size of 12,000 square kilometres in 1956.  The actual size and boundaries were established in 1967. Visitation to the Park steadily increased to its pinnacle of 12,000 visitors in 1971.  The subsequent years were marked by increasing instability in the region due to the liberation war that was approaching the central provinces. \n\nIn December 1981, the Park’s Headquarters (Chitengo) was first attacked by Renamo.  In 1983, due to the increasing number of attacks, the Park was abandoned and declared closed to visitors for safety reasons. From 1983 to 1992, the Park was the stage of some of the heaviest combats between Frelimo and Renamo forces, who alternately occupied the Park.  It was during this period, that most of the killing of wildlife took place.  The second wave of mass killing of wildlife in the Park is believed to have occurred after the signing of the Peace Accord (1992 to 1994), when commercial poachers from Beira and surrounding Districts for the first time in ten years had free access to the bush.\n\nIn 1995, the rehabilitation of the Park began with an eighteen months’ Emergency Programme (EP) funded by EU and implemented by IUCN.  The programme successfully re-occupied the Park and activities like the establishment of an anti-poaching team of sixty game guards, demining of about 80% of suspected areas and community awareness programmes were undertaken. \n\nAmerican millionaire Gregory Carr is currently investing about $39m in Gorongosa National Park, the use of which will include bringing black and white rhinos and buffalo back into the park.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\nDue to its geographic location, the Gorongosa National Park has the most varied habitat types in the region, hence, the diverse and once abundant wildlife. Although the numbers of most large mammal  species have been heavily reduced, none of the species that existed before has gone extinct, meaning that the species diversity and the habitat is still intact. Large herds of Waterbuck, Impala, Oribi, Kudu, Hartebeest, Reedbuck and Nyala can be found in the park.  The Lions and Elephants are seen but their numbers are still to low for frequent encounters.\n\nThe avifauna with more than 580 species, including endemics and rarities remains an untouched attraction of the Park\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nGorongosa National Park is closed during the rainy season (generally December - March) Annual rainfall is in the region of 1000 - 1400mm per year.
