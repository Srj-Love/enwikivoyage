In the observatory North Korean food products are for sale, and the North Korean beer is actually quite good. Several Clunky North Korean-made Viewmasters give three-dimensional slide shows of idyllic scenes from the DPRK, with commentary in Korean, for a 500 Won coin. The windy road to the observatory brings forth a sense of tension due to the barbed-wire entanglements along the coast and soldiers stationed on alert at a checkpoint along the approach. Tickets and passage papers have to be obtained 4km before the first checkpoint or you will be made to turn around. The building to obtain these papers is not hard to find, it is on the left as you drive North just after the \"World Mineral Museum,\" but the sign 100m before it is only in Korean."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Maritime Museum"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Located at the entrance of Hwajinpo Beach."],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=This museum exhibits 40,000 articles of 1,500 types of shellfish, corals and fossils some very rare."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=KumKangsan Condominium"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+82-33-680-7800"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=225 rooms"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Daemyung Condo"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+82-33-635-8311"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=683 rooms"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Gangwon"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["38.38"],["128.47"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Goseong County, Gangwon"]]}]
