Although similar in origin to other area neputa\/nebuta festivals, the 70 foot tall floats that dwarf most city buildings as they parade through the streets make this version quite unique. The Tachineputa Hall has several floats from previous years on display, as well as hands-on areas where visitors can make their own miniature floats, Tsugaru kites, or Japanese fans. Visitors who come during the months leading up to the festival are encouraged to assist the float builders as they affix paper to the wire frames of the floats.  The lounge on the top floor is a great place to grab something to eat while enjoying a great view of the area. On a clear day, both Mt. Iwaki and the Hakkoda Mountains are visible, and visiting after dark provides a great view of the city lights. The small art gallery on the 2nd floor mainly features local artists."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Tachineputa Festival"],["url=http:\/\/www.tachineputa.jp\/festival"],["email="],["address=Goshogawara City, Downtown Area"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Proceed away from Goshogawara Station on Route 101.

Measuring 70 feet tall and weighing more than seventeen tons, the floats dwarf most of the surrounding buildings as they parade through the city streets. In addition to revelers yelling \"yatte-mare, yatte-mare!\", the parade procession is made up of taiko drum performances on gigantic drums, traditional hand dances, and even the occasional Japanese jester.  This amazing festival and its rich history dating back to the early 1900s were almost lost due to devastating fires that ravaged the city. The festival had all but disappeared when photographs and plans of the original floats were rediscovered in 1993. A small but dedicated group of citizens were determined to revive the festival to its original glory, and in 1998, after nearly 80 years of absence, Tachineputa floats once again paraded through the city streets."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["40.8000"],["140.4333"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Aomori (prefecture)"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Goshogawara, Aomori"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Goshogawara, Aomori"]]}]
