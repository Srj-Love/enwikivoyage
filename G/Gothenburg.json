Most shops and all major taxi companies accept credit and debit cards, so there is no need to carry a lot of cash. \nDowntown Gothenburg is plagued by illegal taxis by night, and they are considered very unsafe, especially for women. Check the taxi rate, which should be on a window sticker. Taxis can do legal robberies, claiming any price of own. Generally speaking, crime rates in Gothenburg are quite low from an international perspective. However female visitors should note that rape rates are high so stay away from desolate areas at night like parks.
