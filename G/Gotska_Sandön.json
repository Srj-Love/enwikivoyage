The island is around 8 kilometres across, and is a national park.

Legend says that it was a base for pirates during the Middle Ages. In the 17th and 18th centuries there was sheep farming on the island, and later cattle and crop farming as well. Today, there is no itinerant population, except the hospitality and park crew.\n\nWorld-renowned film director Ingmar Bergman recorded a feature documentary about the island in 1987.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\nOn an island named after sand, you can expect the most stunning beaches in Sweden. There is some 30 kilometers of sandy beaches surrounding the island. In fact almost all of the island consists of sand, with some stone and gravel. However, most of the inland area is covered with pine forest, tall and breezy.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\nThere is a small colony of grey seals on the island: make your way to Säludden and see if they're there. You may also spot forest hares, toads and several unusual species of beetles, some endemic to Gotska Sandön.

M\/S Gotska Sandön is designed to land on sandy beaches, since the island has no harbour, but depending on the wind you might need to go ashore by dinghy. From the beach you will have to walk on foot to the campsite, between 1 and 9 kilometers away depending on where the captain decides to land (luggage is transported by tractor).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:GotskaSandon NorthEastCoast.jpg"],["thumb"],["A beach on the north east coast."]]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["One of the few scheduled activities, and a popular one, is the daily evening prayer in the small chapel, built in 1894 and rebuilt in 1950 after a fire.
