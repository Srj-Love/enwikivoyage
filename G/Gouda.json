It is a typical Dutch city with many old buildings, canals and pretty sights, and is a popular destination for a day trip. It is also a good base for exploring the rest of the Netherlands, thanks to its great rail- and highway connections. The city is famous for its cheese, its 15th century town hall and the amazing glass windows in St. Janskerk, but there is a lot more to see and do.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Gouda stadhuis februari 2003.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Gouda's Stadhuis"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Gouda haven.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["View over one of the city's canals"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Gouda vanuit de lucht.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Aerial view"]]},"\nGouda has a population of just over 70,000. As well as its cheese, Gouda is also famous for its stroopwafels (syrup waffles), candles and its clay pipes. Most of the city is below sea level, and the lowest point of the Netherlands can be found a few kilometers outside the city.\n\nGouda is pronounced ",{"type":"''","value":["khow"]},"-da, with the 'g' pronounced similarly to the 'ch' in 'loch', not with a hard 'g' like how native English speakers pronounce the name of the cheese.

At that time, the area was swampland. Over the next two hundred years peat was collected and the land was developed. In 1225, a canal was built connecting the Gouwe River with the Oude Rijn (part of the Rhine delta). This was used to help ship goods to France and further afield. This provided a safer route than traveling by sea. This resulted in a surge of economic activity around Gouda and the town gained importance. In 1272, it was declared a city. Most of the canals were built around this time.\n\nOver the years, there have been fires (1361, 1438), occupations (1572) and plagues (1574, 1625, 1636, 1673). In 1577, the castle was destroyed. Despite these disasters, Gouda is still a beautiful place to visit.\n\nIn 1667 a tax was introduced on the locally produced cheese. This raised a lot of money for the town. In 1668, the Waag (cheese weighing house) was built, to weigh the cheese and collect this tax.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nThere are two train stations in Gouda - Gouda (the main station, 5mins walk to the Markt) and Gouda Goverwelle (in suburbia).
