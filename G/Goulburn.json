With a population of 24,000, Goulburn is one of the largest cities in the region and a rural hub for surrounding agriculture. Goulburn lays claim to be Australia's first inland city to be settled.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nSituated at the confluence of the Wollondilly and Mulwaree Rivers, the fertile lands which surround the area of Goulburn were for centuries the home a number of the local Aboriginal populations. White settlers discovered the area in the late 1700s, and the first land grant was made in 1825. The city grew as a result of its location, being located on the road south from Sydney (now the Hume Highway) and in the 19th century it became the administrative centre for the \"Argyle County\" district. Goulburn gained a great deal of its prosperity during the Gold Rush (when many of its main buildings were constructed) and the coming of the Main South Railway Line between Sydney and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Melbourne"]]}," in 1869 (which is still in operation). In particular, the area became known for its merino wool which was sent from Goulburn around Australia and overseas. The city had the unique distinction of being granted city status twice - once in 1853 by Queen Victoria (which established the city as a \"cathedral city\" and allowed its cathedral, St Saviour's, to be constructed), then officially again in 1885.\n\nIn the twentieth century, the city's importance declined as a result of the growth of coastal cities in Australia, as well as Goulburn's proximity to the new national capital ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Canberra"]]},". These factors led to many government bodies and institutions who had established branches in Goulburn departing the city for Canberra or Sydney, and leaving Goulburn to rely on its wool trade and its place as a service centre on the highway. The city was finally bypassed by the Hume Highway in the 1990s and the wool trade has declined, but Goulburn is still considered the major \"city\" between Sydney and Canberra and visitors still take the turn off the highway to visit. Importantly, the city has retained its heritage and remains an important part of Australia's early history.\n\nThough it might be considered quiet compared to the bustling Sydney two hours up the road, the Goulburn area still has a surprisingly large amount of things to do and see, and it remains a good stop-off point in between Sydney, Canberra, the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southern Highlands (New South Wales)"],["Southern Highlands"]]}," and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South Coast (New South Wales)"],["South Coast"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nGoulburn has a climate unlike most of its neighbouring towns due to its location at the bottom of a valley: summers tend to be relatively hot and dry and winters cold.
