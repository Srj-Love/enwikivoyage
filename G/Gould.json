The proverbial \"wide spot in the road,\" Gould is an unincorporated community of roughly 20.

If they feel threatened and charge, moose run up to speeds of 35 miles per hour.\n\nTheir favorite haunts are in marshy spots along rivers, streams and beaver ponds, where moose feed upon willows and aquatic plants.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Powderhorn Cabins and Campground"],["url=http:\/\/www.gouldcolorado.com"],["email="],["address=35336 County Road 21 Walden, CO 80480-9512"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Just off CO Highway 14 in Gould, on County Road 21"],["phone = +1 970-723-4359"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=$54 - $129"],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=Rustic hunting cabins with no running water or bathrooms.
