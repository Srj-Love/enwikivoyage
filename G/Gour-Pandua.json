Malda is the base for a visit to Gour-Pandua. The area saw three eras of glory - the Buddhist Palas, the Hindu Senas and the Muslim Sultans. The Senas, the last Hindu kings of Bengal, were displaced by the Muslims in the beginning of the 13th century. They ruled till the Battle of Palashi in 1757. There is no trace of any shrine or structure of the Buddhist or Hindu periods. Even those of the Muslim period are virtually in ruin.\n\nDuring the 13th-14th century Bengal's rulers maintained a certain independence from the Sultans in Delhi. It was also the period of founding of the Bengali language and the Bengali identity. The Iliyas Shah dynasty ruling from Gour played a big role in that development.\n\nThe place has variously been referred to as Lakshanabati, Lakhnauti and Jannatabad.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nIt is about 7-8 hours from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kolkata"]]},".
