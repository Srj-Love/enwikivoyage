However, the article also includes the highland areas of Pontardulais and Mawr. On the peninsula itself, the article covers all points west of Bishopston, Pwll Du Bay, Fairwood Common and Upper Killay. Detailed information of the urban area east of this line is documented in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Swansea"]]}," article.\n\nThe Gower Peninsula is about 29 km long by 8 km wide and, in many ways, represents a microcosm of the very best of British countryside. There are wide sandy beaches, dramatic cliffs, historic woodlands, salt marshes and open moors, all of which are interspersed with picturesque villages, country inns, castles, ancient churches and neolithic burial chambers. It is a land immersed in the mists of Celtic legends and secrets of smugglers tales. The peninsula is also home to an abundance of wildlife, with perhaps the wild Gower ponies that roam the moors being the most famous and well loved. For recreation, Oxwich is the most popular bay for swimming and boating, while Llangennith is a surfers paradise and  attracts boarders from all over the UK. Rhossili is a dramatic bay, and the sunset over the headland is one of the most photographed  evening scenes in Europe.\n\nThe districts of Mawr and Pontardulais are sparsely populated areas of Swansea's hinterland and offer wonderful opportunities for hillside walking and river-side recreation activities.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nHistorically, Gower convered an area of land under the jurisdiction of the Lords of Gower. It extended as far east as the River Tawe, and so it included what is now Swansea City Centre. This area corresponds very closely to the modern boundaries of the City and County of Swansea. However, nowadays \"Gower\" would be mostly understood to referring to the peninsula only.\n\nThe Gower \"Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty\" (AONB) is an invention of post Second World War planning laws covering England and Wales, and represents a level of protection one step lower than offered by that of a \"National Park\".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["The Gower Peninsula is located in South Wales (",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.gowerpeninsula.org.uk\/gower-map.htm Map of Gower"]},") a 10 minute drive from the city of Swansea.
