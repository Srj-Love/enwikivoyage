This year's festival will be on Friday, 7 November 2008. Every year, Goychay host a festival to promote this product. At the fair, a parade is held with traditional entertainment like tightrope walkers. Dancing and music are found along the parade route, but without a doubt, the star of the show is pomegranate. Taste juices, eat local dishes, enjoy the pomegranate juicing competition and more. The pomegranate holiday is very interesting. There was a game in which every player had to eat a pomegranate very fast. If seeds dropped to the table, the player was disqualified. The winner got 500 AZN. There was also a competition for the biggest pomegranate. About 5,000 people came to the festival and enjoyed the sights. The festival usually takes place in October (information given by students of Goychay's English Conversation Club).\n\n<B>Warning: The date tends to shift for this event until the last minute.
