The south coast of the island is now dominated by the tourist resorts which generate most of the island's economy. The centre of the island is mountainous, with the remains of ancient pine forests on the peaks.

However, one hears many people speaking English and German in the tourist areas.\n\nThe local inhabitants speak Canario, a Spanish dialect characterized by a slightly more singing tone than the mainland, less clear pronunciation and incorporation of different verb tenses. Even for foreigners with a basic knowledge of Spanish, the varieties spoken on the islands can take some time getting used to. On Tenerife however, the pronunciation seems to be more neutral, and leans a bit more toward normalized Spanish. In a way is very similar to Chilean Spanish.

To travel Maspalomas-Las Palmas the fastest bus is 50, which stops at the airport frequently for both directions. Make sure to bring some change as bus drivers rarely accept high value notes.  You can also buy bus passes for certain routes but you can only collect the cards from local offices. Do not expect a bus driver to help you open the luggage compartment, you just have to do it yourself. Never try to make a bus driver smile either as they have the most stressful job on the island. You can find out why by taking the Playa-del-ingles bus towards Amadores. If you are scared of heights and fear falling of cliffs do not take this bus.[Once the highway is complete this route will be altered]\n\nDo not be afraid to take a taxi. Sometimes you can get somewhere allot quicker for a few euro more than you would spend on a bus. Why not walk past a bus station and ask somebody to share a taxi? All taxis on the island are metered and easily identified. Avoid taxis without a meter as they will certainly be uninsured. \n\nRental cars are available in all resorts, both from local companies and large international car rental companies. Most of the large ones such as Avis and Hertz have offices in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Playa del Inglés"]]}," near the motorway.\nGoldcar (http:\/\/www.autocarhire.es\/locations\/gran_canaria_car_hire\/) at the airport seems to offer interesting prices on the website, but in reality you are forced to buy a tank full of gasoline and return the car empty ( which is impossible),  they force you also to take an additional insurance coverage. This makes the price almost double from what is advertised - so be aware of this.\nYou can rent or pick up a car at the airport. The rental offices are located on the gound floor on the new wing for international departures.\n\nThere are no trains in Gran Canaria. There is an autopista (motorway\/ highway) that covers much of the island.\n\nTo go to the other islands are not far, and the island most near is Tenerife which is only 2½ hour away with ferry (http:\/\/www.world-nomad.com\/gran-canaria-to-tenerife\/)\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nThe climate is subtropical semi-arid for most locations, but it may vary a lot depending of where you are going. For the main touristic resorts the weather is mostly comfortable. \n\nIn Maspalomas there is normally 28-33 degrees in July at daytime, which drops to 21-24 by night. In winter, day temperature is normally 23 and by night 16-17. Bad weather can occur, especially between mid-October and March. Temperatures can then drop to 11-12 degrees and be quite windy.\n\nArguineguín has the best climate, with the least wind, and is, due to its protected location, among the driest in winter too.\n\nLas Palmas has a bit of a different climate, and is sometimes clouded and rain might occur, even in May or June, but it is not very common. If you travel in winter take at least a thick jacket or two. If you plan to travel to the mountains bring or buy a scarf and gloves. The freezing point can be reached on Pozo de Las Nieves.\n\nIn summertime, always bring a bottle of water during the day.

Some of these women can be aggressive however, so always be on your guard. Scream \"Molestado!\" if you have to and if you are forced into having to pay for bracelets, make sure you have a few small bills or change and convince them it's all you have.\n\nGay travelers be warned about being approached by very dark skinned Moroccan men. You can tell they are not Spanish from their different hair texture. They can approach you for sex tourism, and will tell you a cheaper price and then ask for more and more, so make sure you agree on one before.
