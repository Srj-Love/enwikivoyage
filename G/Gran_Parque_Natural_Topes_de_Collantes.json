Somewhere between San Blas and Buenos Aires, near the village of Matagua, the pavement ends. Locals say the road is impassable after this, unless you have a Jeep.

Other hikes you are required to go as part of a group, as part of a group tour, and not just show up asking to join a group. The Cuban government doesn't want tourists wandering around the countryside alone. Also, hiking is not a part of Cuban culture. Cubans like waterfalls and viewponts, but expect to drive to the scenic spot and then sit around drinking beer while their kids play in the water. The idea of walking for enjoyment is incomprehensible to them. Running long distances in the mountains is unimaginable. Don't expect to go hiking the way you would in a Canadian national park.

The massive Kurhotel  was finished in 1954, and has 210 rooms, 16 suites, a spa, a restaurant, five gyms, a cabaret, and a thermal swimming pool, and a television station. After the revolution the Kurhotel was used for tuberculosis patients. It's currently used for other medical patients and isn't open to tourists.\n\nMany other hotels were built, and concrete shells of even more hotels can be seen around the area. Hotel Los Helechos (\"the ferns\") is where the tourists stay, and many tour buses arrive each day. The hotel is rated 3 stars. The hotel has a bar, a restaurant (substandard and overpriced), a small shop, a swimming pool (big, cold, and be thankful that it's cold because it doesn't look like it has much chlorine), and a discotheque. The disco is where the local Cubans hang out, and the music is awful Cuban techno-rap. Bring a CD with dance music you like. Prices are 50 CUC for a double room during high season, 40 CUC for a single during high season, 45 CUC for a double during low season, and 35 CUC for a single during low season.\n\nHotel Los Pinos (\"the pines\") may also be open to tourists, just down the hill from Los Helechos.\n\nThe other place to stay is the Villa Caburní. These are twelve nice houses. The price is the same as the hotels, but you get the entire house -- two bedrooms, kitchen, etc. If you have a family and bring your own food this is the best deal.\n\nThere are no ",{"type":"<","value":["i",["casas particulares"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Camping"]},"\n",{"type":"<","value":["i",["Campismos"]]}," are indicated on the map, at Parque Guanayara, Parque Altiplano, Parque Codina, Parque El Cubano, and Parque El Nicho.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Backcountry"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Central Cuba"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinepark"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Topes de Collantes"]]}]
