Rich in history and culture, Granada is a very worthwhile city in Spain for a tourist.\n\nIn addition to a rich multicultural history, the Alhambra and other monuments, a student-driven nightlife, and skiing and trekking in the nearby Sierra Nevada, Granada offers a break from the summer heat of other Andalusian cities such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cordoba (city, Spain)"],["Córdoba"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Seville (city)"],["Seville"]]},". Spring and Fall are also both excellent times to visit. With much more cultural interest than other cities like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Malaga"]]},", Granada is never overcrowded (although one should still book tickets to the Alhambra at least one day in advance).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nGranada has been continuously inhabited by humans for at least 2500 years, originating as an Ibero-Celtic settlement prior to the establishment of a Greek colony in the area. Under Ancient Roman rule Granada developed as an economic center of Roman Hispania, with the construction of aqueducts, roads, and other infrastructure. With the fall of the Roman Empire the city was ruled by the Visigoths before being reconquered by the Byzantine Empire, all the time being maintained as a strategic military and economic center for the region.\n\nThe Moorish conquest of 711 brought Islamic rule to the Iberian Peninsula and Granada was quickly established as a center of Al-Andalus, the Muslim name for the region. New agricultural practices were introduced as the old Roman infrastructure was put to use for irrigation, leading to a major expansion of the city as it grew from the river valley up to the hills currently occupied by the Alhambra and the Albayzín, with a major Jewish settlement, the Realejo, existing within the town. Following the fall of Córdoba in 1236 to the Christian Reconquista, the city became the center of the Emirate of Granada, and for the next 250 years Granada stood as the heart of a powerful and self-sufficient kingdom with the construction of the royal palace and fortress, the Alhambra.\n\nSkirmishes continued between the Emirate of Granada and the Crown of Castile, and in the late 15th century the Christian Reconquista set its sights on Granada. Following a military campaign led by King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile, which included a siege of the walled town, King Boabdil of Granada was ultimately forced to surrender the town in 1492, bringing an end to Moorish rule in the Iberian peninsula and marking the end of the Reconquista.\n\nThe fall of Granada came at a crucial moment for Christian Spain, as it was that same year that Christopher Columbus made his first voyage to the Americas, bringing back reports of the wealth and resources that could be gained there. Flushed with the success of the Reconquista, Spaniards conquered much of the Americas and brought great wealth to the new Spanish Empire. In the case of Granada, the Christians soon forced the existing Jewish and Muslim residents to convert and began making significant changes to the appearance of the city in an attempt to hide its Muslim character, including replacing the city's primary mosque with the massive Cathedral and constructing a large Christian palace in the heart of the Alhambra. Persecution against the Muslims and Jews took its toll, and over time the city began to suffer economically as these populations abandoned their homes in the area.\n\nGranada remained a largely medieval-style city well into the 19th century, going through many economic slumps and seeing much of its architectural heritage destroyed. However, the last half of the 19th century saw Granada incorporated into the national rail network and the first stirrings of tourism thanks to reports of sites like the Alhambra to a global audience. However, the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s sunk Granada's economy, and it persisted largely as a bureaucratic and university town until the late 20th century, when the city underwent a massive period of modernization and development which brought new business and visitors to the city. Today you can still see this modernization in the reconstruction of old buildings in the city center and expansion of the town along the edges of the city.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh = 12"],["febhigh = 14"],["marhigh = 17"],["aprhigh = 19"],["mayhigh = 23"],["junhigh = 29"],["julhigh = 34"],["aughigh = 33"],["sephigh = 28"],["octhigh = 21"],["novhigh = 16"],["dechigh = 13"],["janlow = 1"],["feblow = 3"],["marlow = 4"],["aprlow = 6"],["maylow = 10"],["junlow = 14"],["jullow = 17"],["auglow = 17"],["seplow = 14"],["octlow = 10"],["novlow = 5"],["declow = 3"],["janprecip = 44"],["febprecip = 36"],["marprecip = 37"],["aprprecip = 40"],["mayprecip = 30"],["junprecip = 16"],["julprecip = 3"],["augprecip = 3"],["sepprecip = 17"],["octprecip = 40"],["novprecip = 46"],["decprecip = 49"]]},"\nGranada has a fairly mild climate; hot summers and short but cold winters with a mild amount of precipitation.

Larger streets have sidewalks separating pedestrian traffic from vehicles, while alleyways have short iron posts along the side to make a small informal sidewalk. With a decent map you can find your way around, but many streets are so short they won't be named on a map. Still, if you keep some of the local landmarks in mind (church towers and hills are frequently good ones) you can maintain a general sense of direction - which is often all you need to find your way around. Additionally, Granada has several hilly areas (most notably the Albayzin and the entrances to the Alhambra) with many stairways and steep streets, and climbing them can be strenuous - buses can take you to the major tourist sights if the climb is too much.
