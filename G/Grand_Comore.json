Taxis between Hahaya (the airport) and Moroni cost no more than 500 KmF (1 euro).  Tourists have been asked for 20 euros.  Taxis to the airport are caught in front of the post office at Volo Volo.  Taxis also run to nearly everywhere on the island, with varying frequency.  Taxis to the east coast can be caught near Gobadjou, in Moroni.  Taxis going to Chindini or anywhere along the southern coast can be caught at Hotel Karthala, near the university on the southern side of Moroni.  Expect an uncomfortable, squashed, and hot ride, though interesting.  You may need to be assertive and dive in at your first chance if there are a lot of people waiting for the taxi.  Be careful when going to southern, northern, and eastern destinations (especially eastern) as taxis may stop running as early as 15:00 hours.  Everything slows down on Sundays and holidays, so taxis are less frequent.\n\nIf you wish to rent a car, you will pay exorbitantly.  It may cost 5,000 KmF (10 euros) for a ride that would cost 300 KmF in a taxi.\n\nHitchhiking is very easy and very safe on Grand Comore.  Wave your hand rather than putting out a thumb.  Locals do it frequently and you always meet friendly people.  Of course, some people may try to charge you for the ride.  Be sure you specify that you are seeking an \"auto-stop\".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Karthala volcano"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=One of the largest and most dangerous volcanoes in the world because of the possibility that water inside the volcano could be heated and explode resulting in the volcano exploding and rock raining down.
