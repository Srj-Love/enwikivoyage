Grand Junction is the only major commercial and transportation hub between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Denver"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Salt Lake City"]]},". Yet it derives its name not from the railroads, but from the Colorado River, formerly named the Grand. The city it located at the confluence, or junction, of the Colorado and Gunnison Rivers.\n\nGrand Junction is an ideal spot to plan a series of day trips to the surrounding natural beauty of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southwestern Colorado"]]}," and northeastern ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Utah"]]},". But the city should not be overlooked for its own attractions. There are a variety of things to do in Grand Junction. Dinosaur museums, wine tasting, fine dining, excellent shopping, arts and theater, pedestrian malls and outdoor recreation combine to make this a location worth enjoying.\n\nSurrounded by mesas, the Grand Valley is an area of high desert beauty. To the North are the austere tan bluffs of the Bookcliffs, which culminates in Mount Garfield, an icon of the area. To the east lie the evergreen slopes of the Grand Mesa, largest flattop mountain in the world, and home to many great activities such as skiing, hiking, fishing and horse back riding. (No fall trip to the mesa would be complete without a drive to see the changing aspen leaves). To the South are the red sandstone formations of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Colorado National Monument"]]},". You can visit all these mesas, since they are interlaced with a variety of roads, as well as hike-able and bike-able trails.\n\nBecause of the area's (usually) mild winters and spectacular scenery, locals joke about \"Chief Ouray's Curse,\" named after the Native American Ute leader who used to live in the region. The curse says that once you've visited the Grand Valley, you're destined to return again and again.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nBetween 250 and 1300 AD, the Fremont people were the area’s first inhabitants. Their culture can still be glimpsed today in the many petroglyphs and pictographs they created on canyon walls. Circa 1500, the Ute nation moved into the Grand Valley.\n\nWith the conquest of the Aztec Empire in 1521, the Spanish formed the Viceroyalty of New Spain and claimed a large part of North America for themselves, including the Grand Valley.\n\nAs Spanish settlers established colonies along the Rio Grande River in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Mexico"]]}," during the 1590s, they introduced horses to various Native American nations. It was the Utes' turn in the 1630s. Through both bartering and theft, the Utes acquired their horses from the Spanish. This transformed Ute society as they became skilled horsemen.\n\nThe first Europeans arrived in the Grand Valley in 1776, when the Dominguez-Escalante expedition passed through the area. Silvestre Vélez de Escalante was a Franciscan friar who attempted to discover an overland trade route between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Santa Fe (New Mexico)"],["Santa Fe"]]},", New Mexico and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Monterey (California)"],["Monterey"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["California"]]},". After six grueling months, the expedition was abandoned and Escalante returned to Santa Fe through ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Arizona"]]},".\n\nIn 1821, the Viceroyalty of New Spain successfully revolted, splitting with the Spanish crown. The Grand Valley became part of Alta California, a province in the new nation of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mexico"]]},".\n\nHoping to develop the area, Mexican officials opened the land up to mountain men, trappers and traders. Between 1821 and 1840, explorer Antoine Robidoux ventured through the Grand Valley in search of beaver pelts. Robidoux built Fort Umcompahgre (then known as Fort Robidoux) near present-day ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Delta (Colorado)"],["Delta"]]},". With this influx of adventurers and speculators came many of the men who would later lead U.S. Army expeditions and Government Surveying parties through the region: Kit Carson, John Charles Fremont and Captain John Gunnison.\n\nIn 1846, the U.S. Army invaded and defeated Mexico in the Mexican-American War. With the Treaty of Guadalupe y Hidalgo, the U.S. gained control of the Grand Valley, as well as California, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nevada"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Utah"]]},", and portions of Arizona, New Mexico and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wyoming"]]},".\n\nFriction between the Utes and whites over resources was inevitable. In 1868, the U.S. Government and the Ute Indians signed a treaty that designated the Grand Valley as part of the Ute reservation. But the Grand Valley's rivers offered both a reliable source of water and arable land. This was compounded by the discovery of gold in the San Juan Mountains to the south. These factors proved to be too great for the settlers to resist. Eventually the Utes were pressured to leave the area. After the Utes' forced relocation, settlers poured into the area.\n\nIn 1882, the City of Grand Junction was founded. The railroad came to town a few months later. Canals were dug to tap into the Grand and Gunnison Rivers, and Grand Junction built its economy on farming and ranching.\n\nIn 1900, dinosaur bones were discovered at Riggs Hill to the west of town by Elmer S. Riggs, Assistant Curator of Paleontology at the Field Museum in Chicago. Huge Jurassic era dinosaurs like bracchiosaurus, apatosaurus, allosaurus, and stegosaurus were pried from the desert soil.\n\nBy the mid-20th century, Grand Junction began to ride out a series of boom-and-bust cycles related to mining. In the 1950s, the Atomic Energy Commission set up shop in town to buy uranium for making atomic bombs. Over 35 mining companies used Grand Junction as a base to mine the radioactive element found throughout the Colorado Plateau. During the energy crisis of the 1970s, oil shale was discovered on the Roan Plateau east of Grand Junction. This boom came to a crashing halt in 1982, leaving the Grand Valley in a decade long local recession.\n\nIn the last 25 years, the Grand Valley was discovered as an optimal place to grow wine grapes. An eclectic mix of aging hippies, hopeless romantics, artists and entrepreneurs flocked to the area. They all shared a common dream of creating a wine culture in Western Colorado. Slowly, with a lot of trial and error, this core group of self-taught winemakers began growing grapes and crafting award winning wines.\n\nGrand Junction now serves as a recreational hub for tourists and outdoor enthusiasts. Leisure travelers can hike, camp or enjoy boating and fishing in the surrounding national parks, forests and recreation areas.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["When to go"]},"\n\nThe mild, sunny days of spring and fall are why people move to this mini-sunbelt. Late March is usually when the fruit orchards blossom, with the days averaging about 70°F (21°C) and the nights in about 40°F (4°C). Spring barrel tastings happen at many of the vineyards in April and May, and are accompanied by food and wine pairings. High season occurs during the summer months of June, July and August. Late summer can range around 90 to 100°F (32 to 37°C) in this desert biome, but is well worth the visit because the peaches and other fruit crops fill the fruit stands throughout the region. September is harvest time for the grapes. The third week in September is also the height of the fall color season in Colorado, when the aspen and cottonwood trees change many brilliant colors of yellow, red and orange. October is a shoulder season where the weather is usually decent, but minus the crowds and high hotel prices. November through February are the slow months, when the Grand Valley shuts down for the winter. Bargain hunters can still book hotel rooms at drastically reduced prices, while a majority of the wineries and tasting rooms remain open. Be sure to call ahead, however. Western Colorado is home to an oil shale and natural gas boom, and many hotels are already full of energy workers needed to work the fields.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.flydenver.com\/ Denver International Airport"]}]},", (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["DEN"]]},").
