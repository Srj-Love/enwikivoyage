It was established by three Canadian brothers who had the contract to build a section of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad through the area in the 1880's. It is one of the stops along the historic ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Route 66"]]}," highway west of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Albuquerque"]]},", New Mexico's largest city. After the construction of the railroad, Grants survived as a rail and lumber town, serving as a section point on the Santa Fe Railroad and terminus for short line logging railroads that operated in the Zuni Mountains. The Mormon farmers up the road at Bluewater helped it gain prominence as the \"carrot capital\" of the US. Grants expanded dramatically during the 1950s as a result of the discovery of rich uranium ore in the area.  A crash in the uranium market around 1980 seriously damaged the town's economy, but in recent years it has recovered somewhat.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nGrants is about 75 miles from Albuquerque by car, along Interstate 40, which at this point follows the historic Route 66.
