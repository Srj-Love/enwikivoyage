The bus stops are at the Granville Village School, the Old Meeting House, and the third stop that used to be at the Granville Green is now at the old Drum Shop. Signs are used to indicate where these stops are, but if you are not sure, ask and someone will happily point you in the right direction! As the buses used are school buses and not larger common carrier buses, space is limited, so if you plan to go on one, get to the stop early. Timing between bus arrivals varies but should not take more then five to fifteen minutes. Busing ends at the end of each fair day (around five PM).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Granville Harvest Fair"]},", October (Columbus Day Weekend)"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Noble & Cooley Company for Historical Preservation"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.ncchp.org\/index.html"],["email="],["address=42 Water Street"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +1 413  357-8814"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Tour the Granville Noble & Cooley drum factory."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Granville State Forest"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.mass.gov\/dcr\/parks\/western\/gran.htm"],["email="],["address=323 West Hartland Rd"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=off State Route 57"],["phone = +1 413  357-6611"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Hiking, camping, swimming."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Robert's Hillside Orchard"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.farmfresh.org\/food\/farm.php?farm=1557"],["email="],["address=172 South Ln"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +1 413  357-6690"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Pick your own apples.
