From the western end in Perth, the highway can be accessed from numerous intersections with other highways and main roads – including Canning, Albany, Tonkin and Roe Highways, and Graham Farmer Freeway – as well as numerous arterial roads and suburban streets. From Kalgoorlie at the other end of the highway, it continues west from Hannan Street, the city's main east–west road.\n\nThere are also two rural highways that connect to the highway: Coolgardie–Esperance Highway terminates at Great Eastern Highway in Coolgardie, 40 km (25 mi) west of Kalgoorlie, bringing along interstate traffic from South Australia.
