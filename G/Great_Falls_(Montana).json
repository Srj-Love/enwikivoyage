There's a small \"business center\" with high-speed Internet, available for free. It's a very short walk to the MacKenzie River Pizza Company, Applebee's, and the Children's Museum of Montana. There are riverside rooms available for about $10 more. The city's well-managed riverside paths run right behind the hotel. Very friendly management!"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Motel 6"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.motel6.com\/reservations\/motel_detail.asp?MotelId=4238"],["email="],["address=2 Treasure State Drive"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone =+1 406 453-1602"],["tollfree="],["fax=+1 406 727-3234"],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Chamber of Commerce"],["url=http:\/\/www.greatfallschamber.org\/"],["email="],["address=100 1st Ave North"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +1 406 761-4434"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=I-15.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["directionl1=N"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lethbridge"]]}],["minorl1=Becomes ",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Alberta Highway 4.svg"],["18px"]]}," ← ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shelby (Montana)"],["Shelby"]]}],["directionr1=S"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Butte"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Helena (Montana)"],["Helena"]]}],["image2=US 87.svg"],["imagesize2=22"],["directionl2=NE"],["majorl2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Havre"]]}],["minorl2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fort Benton"]]}],["directionr2=SE"],["majorr2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Billings"]]}],["minorr2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lewistown (Montana)"],["Lewistown"]]}],["image3=US 89.svg"],["imagesize3=22"],["directionl3=N"],["majorl3=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fort Macleod"]]}],["minorl3=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Browning"]]}],["directionr3=S"],["majorr3=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Livingston (Montana)"],["Livingston"]]}],["minorr3=",{"type":"[[","value":[["White Sulphur Springs (Montana)"],["White Sulphur Springs"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usablecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["47.503611"],["-111.286389"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Russell Country"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Great Falls, Montana"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North_America\/United_States\/Montana\/Localities\/G\/Great_Falls\/"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Great Falls, Montana"]]}]
