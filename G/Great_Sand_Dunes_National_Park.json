In its original form it covered only the dunes themselves.  However, it has expanded significantly since its roots, due in large part to concern among residents of nearby communities about the need to protect the watershed containing the dunes.  Recent actions in 2000 and 2004 led first to the creation of a \"preserve\" adjoining the monument, and then to the designation of the combined monument\/preserve as a full-fledged national park.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Great sand dunes.JPEG"],["thumb"],["250px"],["View from within the dunes"]]},"\nThe park includes North America's tallest dunes, which rise over 750 feet high against the rugged ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sangre de Cristo Mountains"]]},". The wind-shaped dunes glow beneath the rugged backdrop of the mountains. This geologic wonderland contains over 30 square miles of massive dunes, and also includes alpine lakes and tundra, six peaks over 13,000' in elevation, ancient spruce and pine forests, large stands of aspen and cottonwood, grasslands, and wetlands—all habitat for diverse wildlife and plant species.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nIn the summer, daytime air temperatures rarely reach 90 °F, with average temperatures in the 70s-80s °F. Summer nights are surprisingly cool thanks to the elevation of 8200' above sea level, with lows sometimes dropping into the 40s.  Afternoon thundershowers are common in July and August with associated winds and lightning. Be prepared to leave the dunes promptly if thunderstorms threaten: lightning strikes are common and may be fatal.\n\nFall is generally mild, with Indian summer days. Highs average in the 60s - 70s °F, with chilly nights in the 20s - 30s °F. Be prepared, though, for the occasional cold fall storm, bringing icy rain or even snow.\n\nCold temperatures are the norm in winter, even though sunshine is generally abundant. The lowest temperature recorded at Great Sand Dunes was -25 deg;F in 1963. Average highs are in the 20s-40s °F, with lows averaging -5 to 15 deg;F. Snow may fall and high winds may occasionally occur, so bring warm, layered clothing and sturdy footwear.\n\nSpring can bring high winds; March, April, and May winds are unstable and can be unusually strong. Temperatures can vary widely: highs may reach into the 60s °F, or only into the 30s °F with an even colder windchill. Lows can also vary from 0 deg;F to the 30s °F. March and April are the snowiest months of the year, but some days in spring can also be swimsuit weather.\n\nThe average annual precipitation is 11 inches including an average snowfall of 37 inches.  Overall, precipitation increases in all directions as you leave the heart of the San Luis Valley.  Yearly there are only 30–40 days when clouds obstruct the sun the majority of the day. The valley is known as the \"Land of Cool Sunshine\", and lives up to that name throughout most of the year.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nRoad access to Great Sand Dunes is limited by its position on the west side of the rugged Sangre de Cristos.  It is most easily reached via a side road from Colorado SR 17 between Poncha Pass, at the north end of the Sangres, and the town of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alamosa"]]}," to the south.  Another access route is via US 160, which crosses a high pass through the Sangres between Alamosa and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Walsenburg"]]}," on Interstate 25, and then onto SR 150, reaching the same access road as the SR 17 route.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\n\nGreat Sand Dunes is a long way from a major airport (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Denver"]]}," is about 150 miles away as the crow flies, considerably further as the car drives), but nearby ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alamosa"]]},"'s airport ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.alamosacounty.org\/depts\/Airport\/index.html"]}," has regular commuter service to Denver on Great Lakes Airlines.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\n\nEntrance fees are $3.00 for each adult, with no charge for children 15 or younger.

The Great Sand Dunes Annual Permit also allows free access to the park for one year and costs $15.00.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nIf you are going to be in the Crestone\/BACA and Moffat area Windhorse Transportation is a great service that will give you great tours and is also a taxi service.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nGood views of the dunes are available at the visitor center, just inside the entrance station.

The dunes themselves are a very short distance from the visitor center, and you can reach them by simply following the obvious path.  Once you're in the dunes, there are no marked trails; you simply wander among them until you've had your fill.  (Either keep the visitor center in sight, or bring a compass.)  You'll get sand in your shoes; dress accordingly and have a change of clothes, or at least shoes, waiting at the car.  Trails into the high country are reachable from farther up the road, beyond the dunes.\n\nA guidebook with details on numerous hikes in the area, as well as other activities, food, and lodging, is ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Essential Guide to Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve"]},", ISBN 097244131X.\n\nDuring spring and early summer, runoff from the Sangre de Cristo Mountains coalesces in a little creek that runs along the south side of the dunes, past the visitor center.  Where Mosca Creek passes through the dunes, a remarkable beach-like atmosphere results that draws families doing precisely the things you'd expect at any other beach—with the obvious exception of swimming, since the creek is only about six inches deep.  You'll see picnics, small children wading in the creek (which is warmed by the sun), Frisbee tossing, maybe even a little beach volleyball.  Come prepared to participate, and bring a change of clothing, particularly shoes; there is a changing room and rinse station near the visitor center to get the sand out of your clothes (and you) before you get back in the car.  Flow in the creek is seasonal, and by the end of the summer there may not be enough water left for some of these activities.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nAJ's Truck Stop is a truckerschoice.com truckstop.

No permit is required for camping along this road.\n\nBackcountry camping in the dune field itself is also possible, with a free permit, and is a truly mind-blowing experience. Sitting atop a dune, watching the sunset along the Rocky Mountains over the high dunes is simply magnificent. The climb in with a pack is rough on the steep sands, so be prepared for a real workout. The best time of the year to camp in the dunes is undoubtedly late Spring, since sand temperatures are too hot in the Summer, and even in the Fall.
