[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Welcome banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Greek language"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Greek"]}," is one of the oldest attested Indo-European languages, known from 1400 BCE in inscriptions in a syllabary of Minoan origin. The present alphabet was introduced by a Phoenician called Qadmu (Καδμος) about 800 BCE, and has been in use, with a few letters added and removed, continuously since then. The 24-letter alphabet used in Classical Greek is the same one used today. Greek is the official language of both ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Greece"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cyprus"]]},", but is only spoken in the south of the latter.\n\nMany Greek words have been borrowed into other languages, so you will find a lot of these words familiar, such as ",{"type":"''","value":["τραυμα"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["trauma"]},", \"injury\") and ",{"type":"''","value":["σοφία"]},"  (",{"type":"''","value":["sofia"]}," \"wisdom, knowledge\"). Originally they were borrowed into Latin, which became the Romance languages. The changes Greek words underwent in Latin are different from those they underwent in Greek. For instance, in a rare case of someone actually returning a word he borrowed, κινημα (",{"type":"''","value":["kinema"]},", motion) was borrowed into Latin as ",{"type":"''","value":["cinema"]},", which in French acquired the meaning \"movie\", and was returned to Greek as σινεμα (",{"type":"''","value":["sinema"]},").\n\nGreek has changed less in the last two thousand years than English has in the last five hundred. It still has three genders, five cases, and movable ν. Although the dative dropped out of use in Greek before the dative merged with the accusative in English, one can still form the dative of ",{"type":"''","value":["μπαγλαμας"]}," (a stringed instrument smaller than the ",{"type":"''","value":["μπουζουκι"]},"), even though it belongs to a new declension.

If there's an accent at the first vowel of a diphthong, or a diaeresis on the second, then it isn't an actual diphthong and the two vowels are pronunced separately. The former occasion is the most common, but since words written in capital letters never get accents, the diaeresis is the only way to note the broken diphthong at all-caps phrases - English such example: naïve. (diairesis = two dots on top of iota or upsilon, Ϊ\/ϊ - Ϋ\/ϋ)\n\nAll vowels have the same short length. So yes, there are 2 ways to write 'e', 6 to write 'i' and 2 letters to write 'o'!\n\nDiphthongs 'γγ' and 'γχ' are never found at the start of a word. Vowel diphthong 'υι' is very rare, virtually only in a couple words.\n\nGreek language lacks a 'sh' sound. Consequently there are only simple unaspirated s, z, ts, j, x 's (no ",{"type":"'''","value":["sh"]},"ame, plea",{"type":"'''","value":["s"]},"ure, lu",{"type":"'''","value":["x"]},"urious, ",{"type":"'''","value":["ch"]},"in etc.). Also, \"ς\" is the form of Sigma used only when it is the last letter of a word. Graphically it looks like English s.\n\nThe capital letters are more or less the same with the ones of the English alphabet. Although the small letters seem entirely different (and some of them are indeed) at people's handwriting they can be extremely close to English.\n\nNote also that Greek punctuation differs a little: The Greek question mark (ερωτηματικό) is just like the Latin semi-colon ",{"type":"'''","value":[";"]}," . While the Greek semi-colon (άνω τελεία) is like the full stop \"flying\" just above the line ",{"type":"'''","value":["•"]},".\n\nGreek people know they have a difficult language (for foreigners) and don't expect any tourist to know more than a couple words. And even while they think it's easy phonetically, they understand the problems foreigners have pronouncing it. You can say gamma as a hard 'g', chi as 'h', and rho as an unrolled English 'r', you can also say \"au\" or \"eu\" instead of \"av\" and \"ev\" and you'll be totally understood. People in no way expect you to be proficient in any aspect of Greek, so by studying a bit before visiting you can really impress people and win their hearts! Of course, it will require serious effort and dedication to learn to speak Greek fluently, as Greek grammar is admittedly  more complex than it is in most other languages (much more demanding than German, for example, which is a language with relatively complex grammar). But still, you can master relatively easily the fundaments of communication and get your meaning across. And even if you don't, don't despair: almost all Greeks (but the oldest) can understand and speak English.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Phrase list"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Basics"]},"\n; Hello. : Γεια σας.
