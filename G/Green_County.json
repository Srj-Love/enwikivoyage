After a review of land in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Indiana"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Illinois"]]},", the agents settled on land in Green County, which had reminded them of Switzerland.  The first immigrants arrived in 1845 and were followed by more immigrants in the following years.\n\nThis original Swiss immigration and later influx contributed to many of the unique architecture and local cultural characteristics in the area.  Both New Glarus and Monroe have old world architecture in their downtown areas, and many local traditions include yodeling and a Swiss game called jass.\n\nGreen County is also renown in the greater southern Wisconsin area for its annual Cheese Days celebration.  The event originated in 1914 when, according to the celebration's website, \"...the notion that if some little town in Illinois could have a festival commemorating sauerkraut, then [the founders thought] a celebration based on cheese would be an even better idea.\"  The annual celebration is held each year in Monroe.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nThe vast majority of the County speaks English as a primary language.
