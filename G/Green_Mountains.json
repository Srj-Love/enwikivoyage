And despite the heavy forest, there are plenty of open areas, wetlands, and escarpments where wildlife tend to gather. As with all national forest land, there are parts set aside for recreation, logging, and mining, as well as areas that are totally closed off to protect wildlife.  Trails and roads in the forest are well maintained and range from very scenic to mosquito-ridden.    \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\nThe Green Mountains have a huge range of wildlife.  They are mostly covered by northern deciduous forests (maples, oaks, birches, etc) but also have patches of coniferous forest, wetlands, tundra, grassy ski slopes, and powerline greenways.  Each of these areas has its own collection of flora and fauna.  Thousands of bird species flock to these well-protected mountains and the bird-watching can really be excellent, especially in the clearings where birds come to feed and mate.  Mammals in the national forest are more reclusive but abound in large numbers, and if you're lucky you might see a moose, black bear, coyote, fox, or Indiana Bat.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nThe weather in the Green Mountains varies heavily between season and even between elevation.
