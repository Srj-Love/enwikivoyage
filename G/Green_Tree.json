Indoor pool, full locker facilities, and a spacious exercise room with dozens of machines. The recent change to Holiday Inn Express branding has brought with it some updates to the decor. The rooms can be oddly shaped, and the walls are a bit thin, but the amenities available more than make up for any such quirks."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=I-376.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["image1a=US 22.svg"],["imagesize1a=22"],["image1b=US 30.svg"],["imagesize1b=22"],["directionl1=W"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hermitage (Pennsylvania)"],["Hermitage"]]},"\/",{"type":"[[","value":[["Steubenville"]]},"\/",{"type":"[[","value":[["Canton (Ohio)"],["Canton"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Robinson Township"]]}],["directionr1=E"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Monroeville"]]},"\/",{"type":"[[","value":[["Altoona (Pennsylvania)"],["Altoona"]]},"\/",{"type":"[[","value":[["York (Pennsylvania)"],["York"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Pittsburgh"]]}]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["40.415000"],["-80.049722"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Allegheny County"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Green Tree, Pennsylvania"]]}]
