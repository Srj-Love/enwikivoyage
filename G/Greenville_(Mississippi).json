The downtown area in particular and much of the town north of Highway 82 (this highway often seen as a sort of \"dividing line\" by many) is continuously ridden with theft, assault, and much more, sometimes even in daylight and in popular areas such as near the library or churches. If one must go into more dangerous parts of Greenville, it is still better to do so in the day, and to be accompanied with other people; it is less dangerous for a female to go along with males. The most that can be done to protect oneself is to use the most common sense as possible, such as always locking one's car and never leaving valuable items inside, staying away from dark and deserted areas and not taking dangerous routes when it isn't necessary, and not drawing too much attention to oneself (i.e., wearing expensive jewelry or females wearing too revealing of clothes). While police have made some attempts to monitor and patrol downtown Greenville more, many residents complain that the town's police force is still highly ineffective. Much of south Greenville - for example, along Highway 1 South near the Nelco Movie Theater and Country Club, South Main Street near the Bowmanor Subdivision and Bayou Road, and the area surrounding Cypress Road - is considered to be generally safe and inhabited by middle- to upper-class families, although some crime occasionally drifts into these areas as well.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Racism"]},"\nIt should also be noted that Greenville is a town of ever-present and prominent racial discord, despite moderate progress since the 1950s. Many older, more upper-class whites (a small yet powerful minority) in particular still harbor views of varying degrees of racism, although this phenomenon is significantly less common in most middle-aged or younger whites (yet still very pronounced in others). Socializing and mixing with blacks too much could possibly be discouraged by some middle-aged white parents today, though it would have been a lot more common a few decades ago. Conversely, some blacks (whose race accounts for about 70% of the town's population) hold to what is commonly referred to as \"reverse racism;\" for example, it is often hard for a white teenager to find a job in local fast food or retail establishments where the management and all the employees are black. A visiting black man could possibly be looked down on by a white man, and vice versa. Both races often tend to form their own areas in the town, with a few middle-class areas being more or less mixed.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Cleveland (Mississippi)"],["Cleveland"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Indianola (Mississippi)"],["Indianola"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["33.3986"],["-91.0483"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Mississippi Delta"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Greenville, Mississippi"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Greenville, Mississippi"]]}]
