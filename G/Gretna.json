It is known as a border town, the border with England being just to the south. This entry concerns both Gretna and Gretna Green, which is located on the other side of the M74. \n\nThe border status has made it a traditional stop for weddings that could be prevented in England but not Scotland, the traditional venue being the Old Blacksmiths Shop in Gretna Green. These days the marriage laws in England and Scotland are similar, so there is not the need to cross the border to get married, but Gretna is a popular venue for weddings of people from the Uk and further afield. About 5000 weddings per year are celebrated in Gretna (which has a population of 2700).\n\nFor many years, the border status meant Gretna had a football team that played in England, until a new owner took it for a drastic rise and fall as a Scottish team.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Scotland Welcomes You^ - geograph.org.uk - 7129.jpg"],["thumb"],["Crossing the border"]]},"\nGretna is well served by road, being just off the M74. Both road and railway fork at Gretna to take traffic to Glasgow or Dumfries; a train trip to Gretna is slightly more difficult since passengers on the main west coast line have to get off at Carlisle and take a train north on the Nith Valley line, which stops for Gretna Green very soon after crossing the border and splitting from the main line.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Gretna Green Story Museum"],["alt=The Old Blacksmiths"],["url=http:\/\/www.gretnagreen.com\/gretna-green-story-exhibition-a760"],["email="],["address=DG16 5EA"],["lat=55.00546"],["long=-3.06295"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Daily 9.00-17.00 (or 18.00)"],["price=Â£3.50"],["content=An exhibition in the traditional wedding venue of the Old Blacksmiths.
