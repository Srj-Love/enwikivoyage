It is located on the Neman River, close to the borders of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Poland"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lithuania"]]}," (about 20 km and 30 km away respectively).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nThis is a very pleasant town with a nice pedestrian area and central square worth a visit if you are in Belarus, but it may remind you more of western Europe than the former Soviet Union until you get out of the centre.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nThe train station at Grodno is where the change of car trucks (wheels and axles) takes place to accommodate different track gauges on east and west routes. It is a place of almost terrifying size, disorder and noise.  \n\nCarriages are uncoupled from the others and, in turn, lifted about ten feet as the trucks are changed. This is done without notice and while the operation takes place one has a good view of the acres of rusted, obsolete and unused equipment that litters the area.\n\nDomestic trains from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Minsk"]]}," are daily, departing 4:22PM taking five hours, with several night trains.\n\nThere are several international trains from Russia, the one from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]}," is daily and for a 16 h journey. From ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saint Petersburg"]]}," there is up to three departures a week taking 22 h. During summer additional routes are added, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Odessa"]]}," (39 h) via ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kiev"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Simferopol"]]}," (37.5 h) and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sochi"]]}," (62 h). From Poland, you can take train in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Białystok"]]},". There is two direct trains per day, at 06:50 AM and at 19:02 PM. A ticket is about 20 zlotys.\n\nNote that cigarette smuggling is very common, and many people will be doing it.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nRoads are pretty good, you can easily get here from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Minsk"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brest (Belarus)"],["Brest"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vilnius"]]}," (Lithuania), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Białystok"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Warsaw"]]}," (Poland).\n\nBe aware of borders, and possible waiting in line (especially on the Polish boarder ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kuznica"]]},"-",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bruzgi"]]}," or, with usually smaller lines, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Berestavitsa"]]},").\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nThere are a lot of buses from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Minsk"]]}," (costs around 45,000 rubles for the express route, which takes 4 h)  from Vostochnyj Station or from Druzhnaya Station (behind the main train station), few from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brest (Belarus)"],["Brest"]]}," (the same price), few from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vilnius"]]},", one bus from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Warsaw"]]}," (departure around 10-11AM from Warszawa-Stadion station; a few buses from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nThere are plenty of buses and trolley buses going around town. In the evenings though, they get down to travelling on the outskirts iblt once an hour or two. A ticket for a trip costs 1300 rubles ($0.20 US). Buy the tickets from kiosks near the bus stops. If you speak no Russian, just say \"Talony,\" and hold up fingers to indicate how many.\n\nWhen you get on the bus, find a grey metal device that they have near the windows, put your ticket in and clamp down on it with a little lever next to it. Then, it is validated and if a ticket controller comes in, you will get no fine.\n\nTaxis are cheap and plentiful: taxi trips within the city cost about 8000 rubles.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Kalozha Church"],["alt=Sts.
