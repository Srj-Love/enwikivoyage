It's the capital of a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Groningen (province)"],["province"]]}," with the same name and home to some 190,000 inhabitants. Its large university with some 50.000 students give the city a pleasant youthful atmosphere and plenty of things to do. Combined with the fine historic heritage, an excellent museum and good shopping opportunities, this is a prime destination in the north.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Understand"]},"\nArchaeologists have found traces of inhabitance from the neolithic and the later Iron Age. It is not quite clear if the area has been inhabited continuously since that time. However, it is certain that the city appeared in writing in the year 1040 as \"Villa Cruoninga\", apparently already a place of some significance. The city has a rich history, which can be seen clearly from the old medieval buildings in the down town area.\n\nIn the 13th century, when Groningen was an important trade centre, its inhabitants built a city wall to underline its authority. The city had a strong influence on the surrounding lands and made its dialect a common tongue. The most influential period of the city was the end of the 15th century, when the nearby province of Friesland was administered from Groningen. During these years, the Martini Tower was built, which loomed over the city at (then) 127 meters tall, making it the highest building in Europe at the time. The city's independence came to an end when it chose to join forces with the Spanish during the Eighty Years' War in 1594. It later switched sides, joining the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands.\n\nIn 1614, the University of Groningen was founded, initially only for religious education. In the same period the city expanded rapidly and a new city wall was built. That same city wall was tested during the Third Anglo-Dutch War in 1672, when the city was attacked fiercely by the bishop of Münster, Bernhard von Galen. The city walls resisted, an event which is celebrated with music and fireworks on 28 August (as \"Groningens Ontzet\" or \"Bommen Berend\").\n\nThe city did not escape the devastation of World War II. In particular, the main square, Grote Markt, was largely destroyed in April 1945, at the Battle of Groningen. However, the Martinitoren, its church, the Goudkantoor, and the city hall were not damaged. The battle there lasted several days.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\nIt's a fairly long way from the major destinations in the Western Netherlands, but getting here is not hard. Groningen has three train stations, the central station (Station Groningen), Groningen Europapark and Groningen Noord. All trains eventually arrive at the central station; only a few trains stop at the smaller stations.\n\nThere are direct trains from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["The Hague"]]}," and Schiphol airport and from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rotterdam"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Utrecht"]]}," to Groningen (2.5 hours) and Amsterdam Centraal can be reached with one change at Lelystad or Amersfoort\/Utrecht.

Be aware that you need to book a day in advance to get the lowest fare.\n\nYou can get a ticket directly from and to Bremen Airport at the VVV office in Groningen, or book (and print) online.

The major highways are the ",{"type":"'''","value":["A7"]}," (west-east) and the ",{"type":"'''","value":["A28"]}," coming from the south.

Parts of town are car-free, there are many one way roads, parking is not always easy to find, and none of it is free.\n\nThere are several Park & Ride facilities; once of the biggest is on Sontweg, to the east of the city and near IKEA. It is clearly marked when driving on the ring road. Parking there is free, and for 2 euro (one way) or 5 euro return for 5 people, a regular bus service takes you right to (and from) the Grote Markt, the heart of the city.\n\nIf you are coming from Germany you can park at \"kardinge\".  Follow the road to \"Eemshaven\" and take the exit \"Kardinge\". The busses here go about every 10 minutes or more often and for the same price as trip from IKEA.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nGroningen is served by ",{"type":"'''","value":["Groningen Airport Eelde"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["GRQ"]]},") with direct flights to and from selected cities in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Austria"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Greece"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Italy"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Portugal"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Spain"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Turkey"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Goudkantoor Groningen Netherlands.JPG"],["thumb"],["The Goudkantoor is one of the most outstanding buildings in the city centre."]]},"\n\nLike most cities in the Netherlands, Groningen's historic city center is surrounded by a canal, the ",{"type":"'''","value":["diepenring"]},".  Most of the sights are within this area, and the Central Station is 50m outside it.\n\nWithin the diepenring, traffic is very restricted; Groningen's centre is designed to be as traffic-free as possible, and it is very difficult to drive and park within this area.  Even resident parking permits are strictly rationed.  However, the central area is compact and can be easily crossed on foot or with a bicycle.\n\nFurther out, Groningen has a loosely connected ring road, consisting of several N-roads forming a rather square ring shape around the centre.  The city sprawls somewhat and crosses this ring in places, but most of the population live within this area.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bike"]},"\nGetting from any place in Groningen to the centre will take at most 20 minutes ",{"type":"[[","value":[["cycling"]]},". This makes the bike a fast, cheap and easy way to travel in Groningen. Don't get scared by the overwhelming amount of bicycles. The city houses tens of thousands of students, whose primary means of transportation is the bike. Be advised though; bicycle theft is pretty high so use a good lock (preferably two).\n\nBicycles are available for rent at a number of places around town, including a facility in the Central Station.

Over recent decades, the city has attempted to find a balance between modern architecture and historic grandeur: and with success. The latest initiative is a major renewal of the eastern side of the Grote Markt, for which the building is currently in progress and planned to be complete in 2017.\n\nLike many cities in The Netherlands, the centre is surrounded by a canal. Several historic canals have been \"gedempt\", or filled, however, and turned into streets. This is reflected in their names, and you'll likely find yourself strolling along the Gedempte Zuiderdiep.

Located in the city centre it can be a little bit noisy at times, but overall this place gives good value for money. Rooms come in different types, with the more expensive ones being quite a bit more spacious. The staff is helpful and there are facilities like a sauna and Turkish steam bath.
