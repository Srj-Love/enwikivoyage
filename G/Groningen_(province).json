There are picturesque villages, historical mansions and ample opportunities to just enjoy the laid-back countryside life in this most northern part of the Netherlands.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Groningen"]]}," — vibrant student city where historical buildings and modern architecture go hand in hand"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Appingedam"]]}," — very picturesque canals with the famous \"hanging kitchens\""]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Bourtange"]]}," — an old Dutch fortified village"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Delfzijl"]]}," — small city with busy port and industrial area"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Pieterburen"]]}," — the Pieterburen seal hospital and mudflat hiking"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Uithuizen"]]}," — the Menkemaborg, a small castle with labyrinth and beautiful gardens, and a large museum dedicated to World War II"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Warffum"]]}," — charming village with an open-air museum"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nAgriculture is one of its mainstays.
