The region (Montmagny Regional County Municipality) is known for bird-watching, goose-hunting and cheeses.\n\nGrosse Isle (Grosse-Île, \"big island\"), now a Canadian national historic site, was notorious for its role as disembarkation point for \"coffin ships\" — the overcrowded, disease-ridden immigrant vessels in which the starving Irish fled the Great Potato Famine of the 1840s.

An estimated five thousand Great Famine victims are buried on the island, the largest potato famine graveyard outside ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ireland"]]},". Thousands more were buried at sea before their ships even reached the New World. Of 90000 who fled Ireland for Canada, an estimated 16000 succumbed to the typhus epidemic of 1847 at sea, at Grosse-Île or at a subsequent destination; among those who left Grosse-Île seemingly healthy, 6000 are buried at Windmill Point (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Montréal"]]},") and thousands more succumbed in distant communities like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kingston (Ontario)"],["Kingston"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bytown"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Toronto"]]},". Partridge Island, as quarantine station for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saint John"]]},", New Brunswick, was in a similar position with nearly 1200 fatalities.\n\nGrosse-Île is now uninhabited; the quarantine station, expanded with more adequate facilities for arriving ocean liners after Canada's 1867 confederation, closed in 1937 and is now a national historic site.
