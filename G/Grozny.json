Since the end of the Second Chechen War, Grozny has undergone a renaissance in development and many abandoned or low-quality apartments and houses demolished and replaced with newer re-built apartment buildings and suburbs. Grozny was originally a Russian fort and named after Ivan the Terrible, as Grozny is Russian meaning \"terrible\" and Ivan the Terrible's Russian name is Ivan Grozny. Throughout 1994 and the early 2000s the city underwent chaos as Russian military battled Chechen rebels. As of today, Grozny is undergoing redevelopment.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nGrozny was originally founded in 1818 as a Russian fort. It was a major stronghold for the Russians during the Caucasian Wars during 1818-1864. During the early 20th century, population boomed because of the city's rich oil reserves which drove many Russians from other parts of the country to work in the city.\n\nDuring World War II, Josef Stalin thought the Chechens were working with the Nazis to overthrow the Soviet government. It was decided to deport all Chechens to concentration camps in Northern Kazakhstan. Although they were allowed back into the city after Stalin's reign, many were angry with years of inequality.\n\nIn the 1990s, rebels began to form groups in an attempt to destroy Russian control in the city and the rest of Chechnya. The government lost partial control and the city was very much dangerous every day. Peace finally began to restore during the late stages of the war in the 2000s and currently the government is beginning to reconstruct the city.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nBecause of Grozny being highly devastated by years of war, transportation is often tricky and hard as much of Grozny's transportation system has been destroyed. However, since reconstruction began, it's possible to take a flight to the city or use a train, bus or the convenient highway system.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nThe only two ways to get to Grozny by air are by using the Vnukovo Airport in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]}," and the Sabiha Gokcen Airport in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Istanbul"]]},". Rusline is one airline with regular flights between Moscow and Grozny, and Grozny Avia is the second airline with the regular flights between Istanbul and Grozny, although it may be difficult if not impossible for non Russian visitors to gain proper authorization to travel there.

The tram is not expected to re-open, but the trolley has re-opened this year. The trolley still has not fully developed, so it's advised to use a car to travel the city.
