Some of the trains are Golden Pass Panoramic or Classic trains, which cost no more but are worth getting. The Panoramic carriages have plenty of glass, which enables you to see more of the spectacular views as you climb up from Lake Geneva. You can also book and pay extra to sit in right at the front of the train - the driver's cabin is perched above your head and it feels like you are in charge. The Classic carriages are all wood-lined and have waitress service for drinks - it's like being on the Orient Express! The trip from Montreux to Gstaad cost 48CHF return in 2008 and is worth it just for the scenery. If you go during the Montreux Jazz festival you can catch a special jazz train, which has live music in dedicated carriages for a few francs extra.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nIn the winter there are ski buses, some of which (the grey minibuses) are free for everyone, while the fare on others in included in your lift pass.\n\nIn summer, if you're staying three days, buy the Easy Access Pass (12 francs a day for adults) which gives you virtually unlimited local travel, including most of the cable cars. It also gives access to some of the fantastic outdoor swimming pools, including the enormous one at the Palace Hotel.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Glacier 3000"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Take the Cable Car 10,000 feet up to the top of the Les Diablerets glacier and hike, explore, dine at the top."],["url=http:\/\/www.glacier3000.ch\/en\/Summer\/"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nTake your time to enjoy the spectacular scenery and breathe in the mountain air!\n\nIn the winter, ski, snowboard, sledge or hike.  There are 220km of trails served by 53 lifts (http:\/\/www.gstaad.ch\/en\/page.cfm\/CablecarsWinter\/Skiareas).  It's ideal for beginner or intermediate skiers, and what it lacks in serious black runs it more than makes up for in its off-piste and ski-touring opportunities.\n\nIn the summer, many of the lifts run.  You can hire mountain scooters to career back down, or have a go on one of the summer luges. Hiking is magnificent in the summer: there are dozens if miles of marked trails.  You can find a via ferrata on the Horneggli and the Videmanette, with routes ranging from the trivial to the downright frightening.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Le Grill"],["content=Upscale rôtisserie."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Gildo’s Ristorante"],["content=Italian and typical Mediterranean food in a \"Casual fine dining\" atmosphere.
