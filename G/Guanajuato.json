It is 390 km (about 250 miles) northwest of Mexico City. The name of the city means \"Place of Frogs\" in the local indigenous language and therefore the frog is the city's official pet.\n\nGuanajuato is a beautiful mountain colonial town. Many tourists and locals consider this city to be the most beautiful in Mexico. It used to be a major silver mining town, and many of the mines are still active. The city is built on very hilly ground, so virtually every point in the city is on a slant. The city has a network of underground tunnels that serve as roads making this place really unique in the world.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nUnlike other Mexican cities that have an exact date of foundation, Guanajuato was the result of miner camping sites after silver veins were discovered between 1540 and 1558 and that eventually lead to a larger settlement. In 1558 a big silver vein was discovered in Guanajuato and produced nearly a third of all silver in the world by the next 250 years. The city was granted its city status in 1741 by Spanish King Philip V. Mining brought wealth to this town that spread towards its architecture and lifestyle.\n\nThe historic town of Guanajuato and adjacent mines were granted World Heritage status by UNESCO in 1987 and has been ranked by several travel magazines as one of the top travel destinations in the world.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Tourist Information Office"],["alt=Dirrección General de Turismo"],["url=http:\/\/www.guanajuatocapital.mx\/en\/"],["email=turismo@guanajuatocapital.mx"],["address=Cantarranas #5 Int. 6"],["lat=21.01594"],["long=-101.2521"],["directions="],["phone=+52 473 732 4363"],["tollfree="],["fax=+52 473 732 9492"],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Mapframe"],["21.0127"],["-101.2532"],["zoom=14"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"''","value":["Guanajuato International Airport (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["BJX"]]},")"]}," in Silao is the closest airport serving Guanajuato.
