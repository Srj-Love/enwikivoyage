[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Guangdong"]}," (广东; ",{"type":"''","value":["Guǎngdōng"]},") is a province in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South East (China)"],["Southeast"]]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China"]]}," on the border with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong"]]},". It is China's most populous province, and one of the richest.\n\nIf Guangdong were a country, then as of 2012 its population of 104 million would make it 12th in the world (after Mexico, ahead of the Philippines) and its GDP of $850 billion would be 16th (after South Korea, ahead of Indonesia). Both population and GDP are still growing.\n\nIn the era of tea clippers, both Guangdong and its capital ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guangzhou"]]}," were often referred to on maps and in spoken English as ",{"type":"''","value":["Canton"]},". This usage continues today but to a much lesser extent with the transliterated Chinese name being used instead. Other versions no longer used include ",{"type":"''","value":["Kwangtung"]},". The food and language of the area are still known as ",{"type":"''","value":["Cantonese"]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nGuangdong borders the South China Sea and surrounds ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Macau"]]},". Though far from Beijing and sometimes seen as a provincial backwater, Guangdong has always been an active center of industry and trade; it was a major terminus of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Maritime Silk Road"]]}," and also important in the era of tea clippers. It has also always been different from Northern China in some ways; there is a Guangdong saying that \"The Emperor is far away and the mountains are high.\"\n\nThe province's economy improved dramatically after Deng Xiaoping initiated economic reforms in 1978. Home to three of the country's Special Economic Zones (marked \"SEZ\" below, see ",{"type":"[[","value":[["List of Chinese provinces and regions"]]}," for an explanation) and to a burgeoning manufacturing industry, Guangdong is now one of the richest provinces in China and does about a third of all China's exports\n\nThe major cities in Guangdong have been magnets for migrant workers from poor inland provinces since the 1980s. In many cities this has led to problems with petty crime and homelessness. It also means that Mandarin is increasingly widely spoken and many taxi drivers or service staff are more conversant in Mandarin than Cantonese.\n\nMany overseas Chinese, particularly those who emigrated before 1949, trace their roots to Guangdong, although many are from other coastal provinces such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fujian"]]}," or the area around ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai"]]},". The Chinese food most familiar to Westerners is basically Cantonese cooking, albeit sometimes adapted for the customers' tastes.\n\nGuangdong has a subtropical climate. Annual rainfall averages 1500-2000 millimeters and temperature averages 19C - 26C. Summers are hot and wet and there may be typhoons. The best time to visit Guangdong is in the Spring or Autumn.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Regions"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Regionlist"],["regionmap=Guangdong2.png"],["regionmapsize=375px"],["regionmaptext=Regions of Guangdong"],["region1name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Eastern Guangdong"]]}],["region1color=#c1e25c"],["region1items="],["region1description=the coastal area east of the Pearl River Delta including the prefectures of Shanwei, Jieyang, Shantou and Chaozhou"],["region2name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Northern Guangdong"]]}],["region2color=#e7ef5d"],["region2items="],["region2description=the inland part of Guangdong including the prefectures of Yunfu, Zhaoqing, Qingyuan, Shaoguan, Heyuan and Meizhou"],["region3name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pearl River Delta"]]}],["region3color=#acc2a6"],["region3items="],["region3description=\"the world's workshop\", a major manufacturing area.

Cantonese people are extremely proud of their language (this applies in Hong Kong as well) and continue to use it widely despite efforts at Mandarinization. Cantonese itself is more closely related to the language of the great Tang Dynasty than the more modern (circa Yuan Dynasty) Mandarin. Cantonese people worldwide tend to refer to themselves as \"Tong Yan\" (People of the Tang in Cantonese) rather than Han, the standard appellation for ethnic Chinese.\n\nNote that there can be significant dialectal variations within Cantonese, and the Cantonese spoken in areas in the far Western reaches of Guangdong (e.g. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Taishan"]]},") are only marginally, or sometimes even not mutually intelligible with the Cantonese spoken in Hong Kong or Guangzhou. Cantonese is also the native language of the neighboring northeastern part of Guangxi province. Nevertheless, the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guangzhou"]]}," dialect of Cantonese is considered to be the prestige dialect, and is generally understood throughout the Cantonese-speaking areas.\n\nAt the coastal areas near the border with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fujian"]]},", most notably ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chaozhou"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shantou"]]},", a language called ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Teochew"]]}," (the native pronunciation of Chaozhou) is spoken. Teochew is not mutually intelligible with Cantonese, but is to a small extent mutually intelligible with the Xiamen dialect of Minnan.\n\nCertain parts of the province are also home to Hakka communities whose ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hakka"]]}," dialect is not mutually intelligible with Mandarin or Teochew and only slightly with Cantonese.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThere are several large modern airports in the region: ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong International Airport"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Macau"]]}," have many international flights; ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shenzhen"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zhuhai"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shantou"]]}," cater almost entirely for domestic Chinese flights.\n\nThe area is also well connected to the rest of China by road and rail.\n\nThere are also many ports, mainly container ports handling massive freight traffic (2.4 million tons in 2003), but with some passenger services. In particular, there are ferries (mostly fast hydrofoils) connecting ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Macau"]]}," with the neighboring Guangdong cities ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shenzhen"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zhuhai"]]},", and some even run upriver to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guangzhou"]]},".
