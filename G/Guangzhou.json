The food and the language of the area are still known as \"Cantonese\" and it is perfectly acceptable to use either the western or Chinese terms interchangeably. The Cantonese are proud and hard working people known throughout China and the world over for their famous cuisine and talent for business. One thing you will notice in Guangzhou's city centre is that there isn't much of the horn-honking cacophony that is present in other Chinese cities. Cantonese drivers seem to follow the rules of the road a bit more than in other cities where it is generally more chaotic.\n\nThe city is famous for foreign trade and business doings, and holds China's largest trade fair, the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#The Canton Fair"],["Canton Fair"]]},". However, in between the seemingly endless skyscrapers, shopping malls and building sites there is a lot of culture and history. While Guangzhou is not usually high on the list of Asian tourist destinations, it is amazing how much the city actually has to offer.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Guangzhou in China.png"],["right"],["noframe"],["260px"],["Location of Guangzhou in China"]]},"\nAt first sight, Guangzhou appears less as a city that is developing than one that is about to explode. Every corner seems to be packed with high-rise buildings, overpasses, and people running marathons. It can be overwhelming, and the initial instinct of many visitors is to leave as soon as possible. However, those that overcome this urge and stay around will discover a gentler and more personable side to the city.\n\nAs a major entry point for overseas culture for many centuries, foreigners are not the anomaly here that they are in other Chinese cities. Consequently, travellers are afforded more personal space and freedom. In addition, tucked away in the back streets, the old Guangzhou of traditional neighbourhoods still moves at an age-old pace, with families and friends often sitting outdoors enjoying tea and banter.\n\nGuangzhou also has the largest urban park in China, an island of refurbished colonial buildings and some world class galleries and exhibition spaces. In addition, possibly due to the distance from the country's political centres, the citizens of Guangzhou have developed a laid-back and play-hard approach to life.\n\nToday, Guangzhou is recognized as one of China's most prosperous, liberal, and cosmopolitan cities. However, despite being an international trading hub, there is still a lack of English signs. Outside of the business districts and tourist areas, very few locals converse well in English. It is highly recommended to bring a phrasebook. Navigating Guangzhou without a phrasebook or understanding of the language will prove to be a difficult task.\n\nGuangzhou is often negatively referred to as the Los Angeles of China, thanks to its sprawl of highways, shopping malls, smog, traffic jams, diverse population and its comparatively high crime-rate. Despite claims of Guangzhou being a dangerous city, it is not dangerous AT ALL! Certainly in comparison to any large western city.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Districts"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Guangzhou map.png"],["thumb"],["350px"],["Layout of Guangzhou"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Guangzhou west.png"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Western central Guangzhou in detail (Liwan and west Yuexiu)"]]},{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Guangzhou east.png"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Eastern central Guangzhou in detail (east Yuexiu and Tianhe)"]]},"\nAfter the restructuring in 2014,  there are 11 districts in Guangzhou.

The celestials bestowed blessings on the land and offered the sheaves to the people of the city as a symbol of prosperity and abundance. After the celestials left, the rams turned into stone, and Guangzhou quickly developed into an affluent and influential city. Due to this legend, Guangzhou has gained several popular nicknames: ",{"type":"''","value":["Yangcheng"]}," (羊城; City of Rams), ",{"type":"''","value":["Suicheng"]}," (穗城; Sheaves of Rice City) and ",{"type":"''","value":["Wuyangcheng"]}," (五羊城; City of Five Rams). In addition, due to the abundance of flowers along the city's main thoroughfares, Guangzhou is often referred to as ",{"type":"''","value":["Huacheng"]}," (花城; City of Flowers).\n\nAccording to historical records, the city was built in 214BC and was known as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Panyu"]}," (番禺). The name Guangzhou actually referred to the prefecture in which Panyu was located. As the city grew, the name Guangzhou was adopted for the city itself.\n\nAs a major sea port, in 786 the city was sacked by the Persians. In 1514 the Portuguese were the first Europeans that arrived in Canton. They obtained a monopoly on the trade in China until the Dutch arrived in the 17th century. In 1711 the British East India Company established a trading post here. In 1757, the government designated the city as the only port allowed business transactions with foreign nations. This continued until 1842 when the Treaty of Nanking was signed, when four other ports were added. Losing the exclusive privilege pushed Guangzhou to become more industrialized later.\n\nGuangzhou was also part of the so-called ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Maritime Silk Road"]]}," that linked southern China with India, South-East Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. As a result of its links with the Middle East, a mosque was established in the city in 627, and a small Muslim community continues to live in Guangzhou to this day. Additionally, the sixth patriarch of Zen Buddhism was born in Guangzhou and taught the famous Platform Sutra in the city. As a result, Guangzhou has retained a strong connection with this school of Buddhism, and the monastery where the sixth patriarch studied is considered a local treasure. The first Protestant missionary in China, Robert Morrison, entered Guangzhou in 1807. This started the spread of Christianity in the country.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["When to visit"]},"\nIn terms of climate, the best time to visit Guangzhou is between October and November. Alternatively, April and May are also good months. Guangzhou has a sub-tropical climate with humidity levels at their highest in the summer. Temperatures can reach almost 40 degrees Celsius. Typhoon season is from June to September. Please note that the Canton Fair takes place annually during the Weeks from Mid-April to Early May and Mid-October to Early November, so finding accommodation at those times can be difficult and expensive.

Tickets can be bought from vending machines in the stations. ¥5 and ¥10 Bills or ¥0.5 and ¥1 coins are accepted. The charge for subways is by distance, unlike some places in the West, where a single fare can cover the cost of an entire trip. You can break up your big bills at the customer service counters. The ticket is a small plastic token, which you swipe over the blue reader at the gate to enter the platform, and at the exit where you insert the token into the slot like a vending machine. Most of these machines do not accept old or torn notes. If needed, tell the officer at the counter where you want to go and he or she will return your note with the requisite fare in coins and the rest in notes.

Unlike other metro lines, you should insert your token at the entrance gate - the exit gates open automatically when approached.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nThere is also a comprehensive public bus service that covers Guangzhou from end to end. By far, it is the cheapest way to move around. Bus fares are ¥1 for the older buses and ¥2 for the air-conditioned ones, although the older buses have been mostly retired. Information at bus stops is mostly written in Chinese, although the current stop's name is also written in either pinyin or English (not always consistent with the recorded announcement in English) and stops close to subway stations are (usually) marked with the Guangzhou Metro logo, which is handy if you are lost. On-board announcements are made in Mandarin, Cantonese and sometimes English. Exact fare or a Yang Cheng Tong card is needed when boarding. If traveling on a quiet bus, it is advisable to signal to the driver that you wish to get off when approaching your stop by pressing the red buzzer next to the exit door or by saying \"xia yi zhan you xia (pinyin:xià yī zhàn yǒu xià),\" meaning \"I'm getting off at the next stop\" or simply \"you xia (有下, pinyin:yǒu xià).\"  In Cantonese \"you xia\" is \"yau lok(有落).\"\n\nBus stops served by many routes are usually divided into multiple sections, each one with a different number. The stops are usually all on the same side of the road, one after another, but in some cases (such as Haizhu Square), the stops are found all over the place.\n\nBuses are only handy for traveling within one district or for reaching suburban districts that are not served by the subway. Heavy traffic can lead to a slow, uncomfortable journey although they can be handy for a cheap but slow sightseeing tour. Trolley bus lines (Routes 101-109) are handy for exploring Liwan and Yuexiu districts.\n\nMost bus routes run from around 6AM to 10 or 11PM, after which there are night buses with the prefix Ye (夜, night). The night route numbers are not related to the normal route numbers. The fare is usually ¥3. Virtually all night buses stop running around 1 or 2AM, and some start again around 5AM. In most cases, taking a taxi at night is a better idea.\n\nGuangzhou has over 30 commuter express bus lines (高峰快线) run mostly during peak hours from major bus and subway interchanges to congested areas and outlying districts. Fares are from ¥1-4. There are also four special lines for University Town (大学城专线). You can find these in most major stations in the city that would take you to University Town. Fares are from ¥2-4. There are also 2 tourist bus lines (旅游专线) passing through many scenic spots in the city. Other special lines are: Lines to some commercial districts, shuttle buses for many different residential complexes such as Favourview Palace and Star River, and even complementary shuttle buses for some shopping center. The driver of a shuttle bus may ask for your receipts.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By BRT"]},"\nThe Bus Rapid Transit system went into service in early 2010. It is essentially a long segregated bus lane (not an elevated busway like in Xiamen) running along the Tianhe Road and Zhongshan Avenue corridor towards the eastern suburbs. Some intersections are traversed by bridges and tunnels, which cuts journey times considerably, but other intersections have traffic lights and therefore traffic jams, and crowds can be as dense as in Metro stations but with fewer doors and a narrower standing area compared to Metro trains.\n\nAll buses that use the BRT start with a B prefix (B1, B22 etc.), though some without the \"B\" stop nearby. When reading a bus route (in Chinese) you can see the BRT logo above each BRT station name, like the GZ Metro logo above bus stops that are near Metro stations. The B1 stops at every BRT station, but other B routes use any number of BRT stations (sometimes just one) and use normal roads the rest of the time.\n\nIf boarding a BRT bus at a normal (non BRT) bus stop, the normal fare of ¥2 applies, however you can transfer to other BRT routes for free, provided you transfer at a BRT stop. If boarding at a BRT stop, insert ¥2 (coins only) into the entry turnstile to enter the platform area; no payment is required when boarding the bus, and you can board at the rear.\n\nAs with normal bus routes, there is almost no English at BRT stations, and only the current station name is in pinyin. Overall it isn't much use to tourists.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Guangzhou Taxi Bytaxi Blue.JPG"],["thumb"],["right"],["A blue Guangzhou taxi"]]},"\nThis is the most popular way for foreigners to get around, and it is very affordable. The starting charge is ¥10 for the first 2.3 kilometers, or about 1.4 miles. After that is ¥2.6 for each kilometer. No fuel surcharge is added. A 50% surcharge is automatically added when the trip reaches 35 kilometers. A few of them also accepts Yang Cheng Tong as payment, but it is not preferred by the drivers. The taxi hotline is 96900. This comes in handy if you forget your valuables in a taxi. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Save your receipt because it contains the taxi's identification number."]},"\n\nMost taxi drivers do not speak English or any other foreign languages, so be sure to have the name and address of your destination written in Chinese to show your taxi driver. Many are from the poorer northern provinces and do not even speak Cantonese. If your destination is not well known, have a nearby landmark included in the address, e.g. \"across from the Garden Hotel.\"\n\nWhilst the majority of taxis are the regular VWs and Hyundais found in almost all Chinese cities, there are an increasing number of 'London taxis' on the streets of Guangzhou (which comes as no surprise as the latest generation of London black cabs are built by Geely Motors in China). They are wheelchair accessible and can carry up to 6 passengers. Many people recommend using the yellow taxis as that company only employs local Guangzhou drivers who know the city well - other taxi companies usually hire migrant workers from other provinces who may not know where they are going.\n\nBeware of taxi driver as sometimes, in addition to going around the block one too many times, they will also try to pass counterfeit bills. Pay close attention as to what they pay when passing toll booths. Good drivers will show you the toll receipts. Only add the toll amount to what is displayed in the meter. A trip between the airport to the East Railway Station will cost around ¥120-130.\n\nMost people find taxi drivers in Guangzhou to be honest. However, during the Canton Fair near the Pazhou Complex, it is common to see drivers violate rules, such as refusal of service and pre-negotiating a price rather than using the meter. It is also difficult to find an available taxi elsewhere in the city.\n\nMost taxi shift changes take place between 3-5PM. During this time, it is hard to find a taxi as many drivers stop working by displaying the \"out of service (暂停服务)\" sign before the end of the shift, unless you are going in their direction. Taxi can be also hard to come by during commuter peak hours of 7:30-9AM and 5-7PM. Finding a taxi during the evening or at night is usually not a problem.\n\nWhen paying with ¥100 notes, ensure that the money does not leave your sight until accepted. Some taxi drivers will turn around, do something, turn back and hand you back fake notes instead, especially if you are foreigner on the way to the airport. In this situation there is almost nothing you can do.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nWhile driving in Guangzhou is an option, drivers unfamiliar with the driving conditions in China's large and densely populated cities should be aware that the experience can be extremely daunting and potentially dangerous. However, it is common in Guangzhou to rent a car that comes with a driver.\n\nCar rental companies in Guangzhou:\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Avis"]}," (安飞士汽车租凭) 9 Huali Road   86 20 3829-6279 Hours 8:30AM–5:30PM"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Hertz"]}," (赫兹国际汽车出租) ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.hertz.cn\/"]}," 89 Linhe West Road, first floor of Jingxing Hotel   86 20 8755-1608"]},"See also ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Driving in China"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By motorcycle"]},"\nAlthough a convenient way to navigate the city's back alleys and lanes, motorcycles are banned in the city center, and riding a motorcycle into these prohibited areas can lead to fines and possible confiscation of the bike. In addition to the central motorcycle ban, electric bicycles are banned from the city roads.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bicycle"]},"\nDue to the improvement of public transportation and increasing affordability of private cars, bicycles are in sharp decline in Guangzhou. In recent years, the government has been promoting this low-carbon mode of transportation. Over 100 rental outlets are now available along many BRT lines and subway stations. The rental fee is by the hour and up to ¥30 a day. One popular bike route is along the Pearl River on the Haizhu District side. Other dedicated bike lanes are slowly appearing in the city center, including Tianhe District. Yangchengtong Card is accepted in many public rental outlets.\n\nNew bikes are available in major hypermarkets from ¥200 for a cheap single-speed to around ¥800 for a 21-speed mountain bike, although quality leaves a lot to be desired. Giant and Merida are the two most common international brands (both are from Taiwan) and whilst a little more expensive (expect to spend over ¥1000 for anything with more than 1 gear), they offer something a little faster and of better quality. Get a decent quality lock too - bike theft is rampant!\n\nFolding bikes are permitted on the subway (but not on buses) and can be carried in the trunk of a taxi at the driver's discretion, but non-folders are not permitted on any form of public transport other than the cross-river ferries. Bicycles are not permitted to cross the river via the Zhujiang Tunnel or Zhujiang suspension bridge, but are permitted to go on the public ferries for ¥1 (see below).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By ferry"]},"\nThe ferries are the cheapest way of crossing the Pearl River (Zhujiang). They were very popular in the 1980s and early 90s, carrying tens of thousands of people across the river each day. Nowadays its popularity declines greatly, mainly due to the completion of several bridges on the Pearl River and the availability of other public transportation. The river narrows when going through the city center (a little wider than the Thames in central London). It is usually faster and more convenient for people to use the bridges or public transport(metro, bus) to cross the river, rather than wait for the ferries. One ferry route that maintains its popularity provides service between Huangsha Pier, situated by the seafood market next to Shamian Island, and the pier at Changdi Road on the Fangcun side. Ferries depart every 10 minutes from 6AM to 10PM. The fare is ¥0.5 for a foot passenger or ¥1 if you bring a bicycle. The fare can be paid in cash (no change given) or by using Yangchengtong Card. There are separate boarding gates for cyclists and pedestrians, and you pay at the boarding gate.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["On foot"]},"\nDue to the sheer size of the city, walking is not advisable if you are trying to reach destinations in different districts. However, walking is a great way of exploring individual districts, and treats such as markets, small antiquities shops and local restaurants can be found up almost every little alley. Walking along main roads can be a nightmare - construction work can result in some inconvenient pedestrian diversions. Open manhole covers or sidewalks blocked by huge piles of cement are common. Take caution when crossing roads, even when the light is green, as bicycles and cars routinely expect everyone to move out of their way and drive through blindly. Many major intersections must be crossed using complex underpasses and footbridges. Make sure you have a map with you. It is all too easy to get lost in the rabbit-warren of small streets and alleys, even if some street signs are also in English.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nLocals in Guangzhou speak ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Cantonese phrasebook"],["Cantonese"]]}]}," as their native language, but due to the large number of migrants from other parts of China, many of whom do not speak Cantonese, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chinese phrasebook"],["Mandarin"]]}," also serves as the ",{"type":"''","value":["lingua franca"]},". As the Guangzhou dialect of Cantonese is far less influenced by foreign languages than that of Hong Kong, this is a good place to learn the language in its \"purest\" form. As Mandarin is the official language of mainland China and the medium of instruction in all schools, most younger locals will be bilingual in Cantonese and Mandarin. While Mandarin is sufficient for the average visitor, breaking into the social circles of locals would almost certainly require knowledge of Cantonese.\n\nEnglish is spoken by more people than in the rest of China (save for Beijing and Shanghai), but still not by the majority, so it is a good idea to carry your hotel's business card with you. To save yourself the hassle and agony when asking for directions, have names of your destinations clearly written down in Chinese by the hotel staff before venturing out. That said, many educated younger people will have a basic knowledge of English and staff at hotels as well as bars and restaurants widely visited by foreigners generally speak an acceptable level of English.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["movetodistrict"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landmarks"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Chan Clan Ancestral Hall.JPG"],["thumb"],["200px"],["Chen Clan Ancestral Hall"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Shishi Sacred Heart Catholic Cathedral.JPG"],["thumb"],["200px"],["Shishi Sacred Heart Catholic Cathedral"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Guangzhou-SunYatSen.jpg"],["thumb"],["200px"],["Sun Yat Sen Memorial"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Our Lady of Lourdes Chapel.jpg"],["thumb"],["200px"],["Our Lady of Lourdes Cathedral, on Shamian Island"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Chen Clan Academy"],["alt=陈家祠 Chén-jiā-cí"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Zhongshan 7th Road (中山七路) (",{"type":"''","value":["Metro 1 Chan Clan Academy - Exit D"]},").
