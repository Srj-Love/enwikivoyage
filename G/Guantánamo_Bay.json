In mid-1958, vehicular traffic was stopped; workers were required to walk through the base's several gates.

By 2006, only two elderly Cubans still crossed the base's North East Gate daily to work on the base, because the Cuban government prohibits new recruitment.\n\nIn the past, Cubans fleeing the revolution found refuge in the US controlled territory.
