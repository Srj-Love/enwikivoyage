Both the El Tigre and Monos pyramids encompass a volume greater than 250,000 cubic meters. Mirador was the first politically organized state in America.\n\nThe Classic period of Mesoamerican civilization corresponds to the height of the Maya civilization, and is represented by countless sites throughout Guatemala, although the largest concentration is in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Petén"]]},". This period is characterized by heavy city-building, the development of independent city-states, and contact with other Mesoamerican cultures. This lasted until around 900 AD, when the Classic Maya civilization collapsed. The Maya abandoned many of the cities of the central lowlands or were killed off by a drought-induced famine. The Post-Classic period is represented by regional kingdoms such as the Itza' and Ko'woj in the lakes area in Petén, and the Mam, K'iche', Kaqchikel, Tz'utujil, Poqomchi', Q'eqchi' and Ch'orti' in the Highlands. These cities preserved many aspects of Mayan culture, but would never equal the size or power of the Classic cities.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Colonial era"]},"\nAfter arriving in what was named the New World, the Spanish mounted several expeditions to Guatemala, beginning in 1519. Before long, Spanish contact resulted in an epidemic that devastated native populations. During the colonial period, Guatemala was an Audiencia and a Captaincy General of Spain, and a part of New Spain (Mexico). It extended from the modern Mexican states of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tabasco"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chiapas"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Costa Rica"]]},". This region was not as rich in minerals (gold and silver) as Mexico and Peru, and was therefore not considered to be as important. Its main products were sugarcane, cocoa, blue añil dye, red dye from cochineal insects, and precious woods used in artwork for churches and palaces in Spain.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Post-independence"]},"\nOn September 15, 1821, the Captaincy-general of Guatemala (formed by Chiapas, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Honduras) officially proclaimed its independence from Spain and its incorporation into the Mexican Empire, which was dissolved two years later. The Guatemalan provinces formed the United Provinces of Central America. Guatemala's \"Liberal Revolution\" came in 1871 under the leadership of Justo Rufino Barrios, who worked to modernize the country, improve trade, and introduce new crops and manufacturing. During this era coffee became an important crop for Guatemala. Barrios had ambitions of reuniting Central America and took the country to war in an unsuccessful attempt to attain this, losing his life on the battlefield in 1885 against forces in El Salvador. From 1898 to 1920, Guatemala was ruled by the dictator Manuel Estrada Cabrera, whose access to the presidency was helped by the United Fruit Company. \n\nOn July 4, 1944, Dictator Jorge Ubico Castañeda was forced to resign his office in response to a wave of protests and a general strike, and from then until the end of a murderous civil war in 1996, Guatemala was subject to a series of coups with massive attendant civil rights abuses. State-sponsored murders of students, human rights activists and the ethnic Mayan peoples, gained Guatemala a terrible reputation around the world. In 1999, U.S. president Bill Clinton stated that the United States was wrong to have provided support to Guatemalan military forces that took part in the brutal civilian killings.\n\nSince the peace accords in 1996, Guatemala has witnessed successive democratic elections, most recently in 2007 when The National Unity of Hope and its president candidate Álvaro Colom won the presidency as well as the majority of the seats in congress.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nThe climate of Guatemala is diverse.

In addition to the driver there is usually a conductor standing in the door -many a times these people are very rude and can even be dangerous if you tell them something you don't like (for example to turn down the volume to their oftentimes nightclub subwoofers).  The conductor collects fares, and from time to time jumps out to direct the bus through a blind intersection or around a tight turn.

It has to be mentioned that regularly there are many people killed in these harrowing quintessential experiences when these buses crash head on with other vehicles, go flying into a roadside ravine or tumble and spin alongside the highway, disassembling the bus in the process and working as a blender and squasher for the passengers inside. \n\nBus conductors may sometimes charge out of country tourists more than the going rate.

You need to recognize where your stop is, and move to the door in time.  You ask the bus to stop, more or less wherever you want to get off.\n\nAlso, robberies of the buses is frequent in the highway in the countryside and in the capital itself. Usually several people, one or more in the front, middle and back of the bus get up, take out their guns and announce a robbery or simply a group of people -or even children- surround you and demand your possesions from you.

Travelers should take some extra precautions when in Guatemala. If you are mugged, carjacked, or approached by armed individuals, cooperate. Do not make any sudden movements, and give  whatever belongings or money that are demanded. Tourists have been shot and killed for resisting muggers. Something you have to be made aware of is that sometimes these robberies are committed by off-duty policemen -incredible as it sounds but being a robber or kidnapper is a part-time job of many policemen. \n\nDo not go to areas known to be hotbeds of drug trafficking activity (i.e.: some parts of the Peten), and do not go to the most dangerous neighborhoods in Guatemala City (zones 3, 6, 12, 18, 19, and 21). Be careful in Zone 1 in Guatemala City, especially after dark, and do not stay in hotels there. Using the slightly more expensive hotels in Zone 10 or Zone 13 (near the airport) is a much better idea.\n\nWomen should be especially careful around men, even if the men present themselves as local hotel employees. Over the last year, several tourists have been the victims of brutal sexual assaults in the beach community of Monterrico and the town of Panajachel. In one case, a local man pretended to be a hotel employee before torturing, raping, and attempting to kill a young woman staying in the area.\n\nDo not use buses in Guatemala City, as they are frequently robbed by gangs. Instead, radio-dispatched taxis (Taxi Amarillo) are a safer way to get around the city. Another note is that when travelling by chicken bus beware of anyone sitting next to you.\n\nAlthough some say that travelers should always carry a bit of extra cash and be prepared to bribe a few police officers, most tourists will have no reason to give bribes to anyone. The most likely situations in which you might have to bribe police would be if you are driving a car or riding a motorcycle and are stopped for fictitious violations of traffic rules. Most European\/North Americans find it immoral but it is much easier to spend Q50 and avoid the headaches than to be harassed by the police. Phrases such as \"I'm sorry officer, is there any way we can solve this right now?\" work well. Do not offer bribes directly to an officer because it is illegal and you could actually end up in more trouble.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Never take photos of children"]}," without permission.  Some Guatemalans are extremely wary of this and will assume you are a kidnapper (even if the children are someone else's).  Guatemala has had many problems with children being sold or kidnapped and put up for adoption on the black market. Of course, this doesn't include a few children mixed in with many adults at a distance. This occurs mainly on the more remote Guatemalan villages. In the major cities people are somewhat more open towards picture-taking, but still avoid it.\n\nIt is ",{"type":"'''","value":["dangerous to travel between cities after dark"]},".

Some of these are notorious for ",{"type":"'''","value":["robberies"]}," (Volcan de Agua, trails around Lago de Atitlán, Volcán de Pacaya).

You will encounter many one-lane roads (one lane each way) and drivers are apt to swerve back and forth, avoiding potholes and bumps along the way. There are also various multiple lane highways.

Tourists can call abroad from call centers, where you pay by the minute.  It is also easy to purchase a calling card to use at public pay phones.  The phones there do not accept money, so to use a public phone on the street you must purchase a telephone card.  Typically, the cost is around 8 quetzals for a 10 min call to North America.  Cell phones are quite cheap and calling to the US through one can get as low as $0.08 a min.  If you are planning to stay for a while and plan to use the phone, you should consider buying a cheap prepaid phone.
