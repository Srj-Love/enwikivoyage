Also, the climate is hot and humid. These two factors give the city a 'Caribbean' soul, where foreigners are usually well received, tropical music rules and seafood is a must do. An old travel book once counted the attractions in Guayaquil as one :\"The Public Cemetery\". Not so, anymore; the city has undergone a great change in these last 10 years as a result of great efforts made by the city administrators.  Now you can find great parks and green areas all over the city (for example Peñas and the Malecon), and the city has a new look which attracts tourism from inside and outside the country.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nGuayaquil was founded on July 25, 1538 with the name Muy Noble y Muy Ciudad de Santiago de Guayaquil by Spanish Conquistador Francisco de Orellana.

Of the more than 260 pirates, 35 died and 46 were wounded; 75 defenders of the city died and more than 100 were wounded. The pirates took local women as concubines. Quito paid the ransom demanded by the pirates with the condition they release the hostages and not burn Guayaquil.\n\nIn 1709, the English captains Woodes Rogers, Etienne Courtney, and William Dampier along with 110 other pirates, looted Guayaquil and demanded ransom; however, they suddenly departed without collecting the ransom after an epidemic of yellow fever broke out.\n\nIn October 9, 1820, almost without bloodshed, a group of civilians supported by soldiers from the \"Granaderos de Reserva\", a battalion quartered in Guayaquil, overwhelmed the resistance of the Royalist guards and arrested the Spanish authorities.

Always remain aware of your surroundings. Don't pay attention to anyone trying to speak to you on the streets, not even to wealthy-looking people or beggars.

It is better to avoid wearing jewelry that is expensive or appears to be of high quality.\n\nBe aware in Plaza Centenario, especially when it is very crowded. The only relative safe areas in downtown Guayaquil are Avenue 9 de Octubre, Malecón 2000, Malecón del Salado, Las Peñas, and Plaza de la Administración. Don't ever cross any other street unless you know where you are.\n\nThe inside of Malecón 2000 is safe during the day and night. There are tons of security guards hanging around during the day.
