Tourism, manufacturing, and horticulture, mainly tomatoes and cut flowers, have been declining. Light tax and death duties make Guernsey a popular tax haven. The evolving economic integration of the EU nations is changing the rules of the game under which Guernsey operates.\n\nGuernsey Pound on parity with British pound (GBP); Notes from Jersey are also accepted. Note - Guernsey pounds are not accepted in the UK and should be changed for UK pounds before leaving the islands.  ATMs generally describe which currency is being dispensed - 'Local' or 'Sterling'.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nMost international cuisines are represented with, not surprisingly, fresh local seafood taking centre stage. For nice views and good food head for L'Auberge de Jerbourg, La Fregate, La Nautique, Pier 17, Sawatdi (Thai) or Mora's. The Crow's nest has good views but is overpriced.  Le Petit Bistro and L'escalier for French and Da Nello's for Italian.\n\nSummer in Guernsey is all about al fresco dining, with long cliff top lunches and leisurely gatherings at old farmhouse restaurants. One of the locals’ best-kept secrets is fresh fish and chips and chilled local cider on the wall outside the Rockmount Cafe at Cobo Bay, the locals' favourite for sun set. Crabby Jack's is another good sunset location on the west coast; caters for families and large groups and around 11pm the dance floor fills up for some old fashioned rocking to all time favourites (NB not for a romantic meal a deux!). \n\nGuernsey’s beach kiosks are a gastronomic odyssey in their own right. The Fermain Beach Cafe started life as a kiosk and evolved into a bistro-cafe specialising in seafood. You can work up an appetite (or work off lunch) with a stunning clifftop walk and then sit down to local crab sandwich, scallops with bacon or locally caught monkfish or sea bass with a view of Guernsey's prettiest bay. In summer, you'll need to book two weeks in advance   tel 01481 238636. For a wooden basket of traditional cream tea (to take to the beach) head for the kiosk in Saint's Bay or Portelet Bay (the latter more accessible for wheelchair users).\n\nPicnics are also popular. For the ultimate spontaneity, pack fresh French bread and cheese, local tomatoes and paté and a bottle of wine and head for the cliffs. There’s a view from a bay or winding path that really is yours alone. Alternatively check the diary of castle Cornet http:\/\/www.museum.guernsey.net\/outdoor_theatre.htm for outdoor theatre or, in summer, live music on Friday nights (usually free). Come early and eat your picnic on the top lawns of the castle, descent with your bottle of wine to watch outdoor theatre or life music in a great medieval setting. (NB dress warm!)\n\nBreakfast:\nBacon butties from Nelia's Bakery, Continental style breakfast at Victor Hugo's, fry ups at White Rock cafe, Halfway Cafe or Half Moon cafe.\n\nGuernsey cream teas:\nThe OGH hotel is an excellent location for wintertime cream teas. The Victoria Cafe in Candy gardens has excellent views (but you mustn't be in a hurry). Cobo tea room on the west coast has excellent home made cakes. Or sample a piece of coffee cake from the kiosk at Port Soif; no real indoor space there but a lovely sheltered garden to hang out in.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Market Kitchen"],["url=http:\/\/www.marketkitchen.gg"],["email="],["address=Market Square, St Peter Port"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=5 mins walk from Harbour seafront"],["phone=+44 1481 712249"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Good coffee with a slice of homemade cake.
