Tree stumps for seats, spools for tables, and the smell of clam-bake in the air, it could only be The Place. The whole restaurant is outdoors, so getting a bite here is only possible during the warmer months. It's kind of pricey so packing a cooler with drinks and appetizers may be wise, however the food is delicious!\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Naples Pizza"]},", 850 Boston Post Road, 203-453-4759. If you've been looking for fresh, cheesy pizza look no further. They also make a great panini and fried mozzarella. It is not huge so seating is limited, but it's a great place non of the less.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Whitfield's"]},", 25 Whitfield Street, 203-458-1300. Whitfield's is stationed right on the Guilford green, which is a very, very nice green. It has a colonial feel to it and the food is rather expensive.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Guilford Mooring"]},", 505 Whitfield Street, 203-458-2921. Right on the water, very nice place. Excellent seafood, the clam chowder is outstanding.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["The Stone House"]},", 506 Whitfield Street, 203-458-3700. Located on the Guilford Marina, the stone house isn't somewhere you want to go for a casual meal. Here its quality not quantity, however the presentation of their dishes is quite nice.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Shoreline Diner"]},", 345 Boston Post Road, 203-458-7380. Just the average diner, if your looking to fuel up on an inexpensive meal this is the place to go. A triple stack of pancakes usually gets the job done.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Quattros"]},", 14 Water Street, 203-453-6575. Probably some of the best Italian food in the area. Quattros is more fine dining then casual, although not too overboard. Ravioli hits the spot.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Little Store"]},", 2802 Durham Road, 203-457-0009. A little shack up in North Guilford right before Lake Quanapoag. Bacon egg and cheese is excellent, actually any of their breakfast sandwiches are appetizing.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Hidden Kitchen"]},", 705 Boston Post Road #C4, 203-458-7806. It actually is hidden, this little breakfast joint is located conveniently out of sight behind the fitness center. Once you find it dig in, they make great French toast. Good luck!\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Deli Unlimited"]},", 1099 Boston Post Road, 203-453-2473. Looks are deceiving, this deli is located in a gas station, but it is definitely one of the best places to grab a bite in Guilford. Amazing sandwich selection among other things, and the quality is great. A local favorite.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Pasta Avest & Pizzeria"]},", 680 Boston Post Road, 203-453-8779. All around delicious! Pasta Avest has everything from fresh salads to mouth=melting stuffed breads.Grab a Foxon Park soda its a local soda that has been around for quite some time. Seating is limited.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Ashley's Ice Cream"]},", 942 Boston Post Road, 203-458-3040. Great selection of quality ice cream. You can't go wrong with Oreo cookie.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Comfort Inn"],["url="],["email="],["address=300 Boston Post Rd"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 203 453-5600"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=I-95.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["directionl1=S"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Haven"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Branford"]]}],["directionr1=N"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Providence"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Madison (Connecticut)"],["Madison"]]}],["image2=US 1.svg"],["imagesize2=22"],["directionl2=S"],["majorl2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Haven"]]}],["minorl2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Branford"]]}],["directionr2=N"],["majorr2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Providence"]]}],["minorr2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Madison (Connecticut)"],["Madison"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["41.282778"],["-72.681944"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Greater New Haven"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Guilford, Connecticut"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North America\/United States\/Connecticut\/Localities\/G\/Guilford\/"]]}]
