Guinea declared its independence from France on 2 October 1958. The first president, socialist Ahmed Sékou Touré, faced a lot of criticism from the West for alleged human rights violations and suppression of opposition parties. He believed in building a powerful, self-sufficient nation, without reliance on foreign powers.\n\nWhen he died in 1984, General Lansana Conté took over. Under Conté's rule, things did not improve and the ideals of Touré were soon left behind. Conté made too many political promises and most of them were never fulfilled. In 1993, the first elections were held, though their results were disputed - as have those in all subsequent elections. Conté died in 2008 without appointing a successor, leaving chaos in his wake.  Immediately following Conté's death, on 23 December 2008, a man by the name of Captain Moussa Dadis Camara took power as Guinea's new President staged by a coup d'état. Even though Camara came in as a popular figure, this has proved to be another political blow for Guinea and Guineans. Civilian protests have been often met with live gunfire and physical abuse at the hands of military and police personnel. In December 2009, Camara was involved in an assassination attempt, and the current \"big man\" is Alpha Condé.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nThe coastal region of Guinea and most of the inland have a tropical climate, with a rainy season lasting from April to November, relatively high and uniform temperatures, and high humidity.

Hiring a motorcycle is the best option.  \n\nCrossing the Guinean border with Senegal is possible but very uncomfortable and requires patience. Inside Guinea, the road between Labe and Koundara is unpaved and very rough. It takes about 8 hours for the whole journey with only minor breakdowns. There are some decent and very cheap places to stay in Koundara. Between Koundara and Diaoube (Senegal) is a similar journey.  The border is relatively hassle free. There is a 20 km no man's land between border posts where one only knows they have entered Senegal by the improved quality of the dirt road. It is possible to change your currency at any hour of the night at the border towns on either side of the no man's land. Local transport from Diaoube to Tambacounda and on to Dakar is relatively easy.\n\nKoundara is also the main jump off point for a trip to Guinea-Bissau.\n\nThe Guinea (Kopoto)\/Sierra Leone (Kambia) crossing with a car or motorcycle is made possible with the 'Laissez-Passer Pour Vehicule', available at the Guinea Embassy (USD40) and with the 'Vehicle Clearance Permit', available at the Sierra Leone Embassy (USD40).

The Government and business centre of the city is unfortunately located at the tip of a long and narrow peninsula which is only connected to the rest of Conakry, which sprawls onto the mainland, by two roads.

Departure times are never set for local transport. In the early morning you might be told that a taxi will be leaving \"toute suite\" (right away) but will not get out of Conakry until well after dark.

There are a lot of people who cannot speak any English at all, even in the capital city.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nGuinea has some spectacular landscapes with a few tropical, dry forests  remaining, and the rainforests in the south are lush, verdant and full of wildlife - much of it destined for the cooking pot.\n\nIn Conakry, there is the National Museum which highlights the distinct ethnic tribes in Guinea and various traditional instruments, masks etc. \n\nThe main port is located at the tip of the peninsula in Conakry, near the President's Palace. You can take a boat from there to the islands of Loos for a day or overnight trip. Its a bustling place where fishermen offload their daily catch.\n\nCape Verga has some of the best beaches in Guinea for exploration.\n\nMount Nimba is the highest mountain peak in Guinea for trekking.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nIn Conakry, one of the best places to grab a beer and hangout is the beach bar in Taouyah, an area with a large market and mostly residential with some night clubs and restaurants. Many expats, including the Peace Corps headquarters, live here and meet up at the beach around sunset for great pizza or fish or chicken dishes. There is a great breeze, live music, and lots of locals playing soccer games until the sunsets, especially on the weekends.\n\nMusic in Guinea is one of the best cultural activities the country has to offer. Some of the best Kora players in the world are from Guinea. There are many bars that offer live music. \n\nThe French-Guinean Cultural Centre has some great musical shows as well as movies, plays, ballets, and hosts exhibitions and conferences. It also has a library and multi-media centre. Members can take out books and use the computers and internet. This is a great place to meet expats, and local musicians, and artists. Most people there will know the best places to go see a show that week. \n\nOutside of Conakry, there are many attractive tourism destinations for the adventurous traveller. Infrastructure, such as hotels, roads etc. is lacking outside of the capital but you can find basic places to stay with limited electricity powered by generators. \n\nThe Foutah Djallon area has superb hiking, sweeping vistas, waterfalls and cliffs. Fouta Trekking is a local non-profit that promotes equitable tourism. They offer hiking tours ranging from three to five days or tailored tours. Tourists stay in villages with part of the revenue going back to the villages for community development. Labe, the historical capital and seat of the Foutah Empire that reigned in the pre-colonial times, is a bustling city with some interesting history. You can buy beautiful traditional cloth in various navy blue colors. On the road from Conakry, via Kindia, is the city of Dalaba, where the major chiefs of the country met to determine the fate of the soon to be independent country from the French in 1958. There is an old mansion that you can visit and a ceremonial hut with amazing carvings inside. Kindia has some of the best vegetable and fruit produce and thus a lively market.\n\nThe coastline from Conakry up towards Guinea -Bissau also offers great tourism with beautiful untouched beaches, mangroves, and wildlife viewing. Bel Air is a well known tourism destination on the beach about two hours from Conakry on a well paved road. There is a large and usually deserted hotel where past political leaders have met. Its a very popular destination around major holidays. A much nicer place to stay if you like more eco-tourism is Sabolan Village which is a small hotel on a beautiful beach that is off the well paved road that leads to the Bel Air hotel. There are about ten modern huts there and a restaurant. Its a bit expensive for what you get but the setting is amazing. If you have a tent or want to stay in a more authentic and cheaper place, you can go down the beach or along the path, past the actual village, and stay in nice huts made by a local villager and now run by his son. Expats who work in the mining areas rent out the huts and come on the weekends but you can always pitch a tent. You have to bring your own food however.\n\nFor the more adventurous is a trip to the island archipelago near the Guinea-Bissau border called Tristao. You can drive from Conakry to Kamsar and from there you can get on a local boat to the Tristao islands. The boat takes four hours and usually runs once or twice a week. You can sometimes get lucky if there is a fishing boat going back to Tristao but they are usually very heavily loaded and may not be as safe as the passenger boat. Manatee, turtles, and many different bird types live in the Tristao archipelago. Its a very isolated place with many animist traditions still in existence. \n\nKamsar is the main bauxite mining export town, where major shipments of bauxite leave from  the Boke region. There are some pretty good hotels and restaurants that cater to the mining executives and expats. The Boke region is the main bauxite mining area. Boke, the administrative city of the region, has an interesting colonial museum, some decent hotels, and a Lebanese store on the main road where everyone goes to watch the football games (soccer) and have cold Amstel lights (when the generator is on).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nThey do not sell a lot of trinkets in Guinea, but they do have wonderful clothing that you can purchase.

Always ",{"type":"[[","value":[["haggle"]]},", especially if outside a major hotel as prices there are higher. A good rule of thumb is to halve whatever the opening price is and also to walk away if the prices don't come down.

You can find everything and anything there. Be careful of pickpockets, mud (during rainy season) and traffic. Its a pretty hectic and chaotic place but you'll find the best produce, electronics etc. at the best prices. You can hire a young boy to haul out your purchases for you if you are walking back to a parked car or where you're staying.

For a mere GNF20,000 (roughly USD4), you are able to dine on delicious, nutritious food. If your taste buds would prefer something international, many other choices are available as well.

Pork isn't served because of the dominance of Islam but is eaten among the forest people of the South east (",{"type":"''","value":["Guinee Forestiere"]},"). There are good restaurants that are Lebanese which have European-styled breakfasts.\n\nOutside of the Capital, Conakry, you can can often enjoy local dishes (consisting of Guinean style rice and one of the 4 main sauces with sometimes beef or fish in some cases) at a hole in the wall' local restaurant for less than USD1 (GNF3,000-6,000 depending on the exchange rate). You will leave full!\n\nIn Kankan, Guinea (Haute Guinee), there are few places to choose from if you wish to eat at a more decent restaurant.  There is Hotel Villa and Hotel Bate.  As of mid 2008, these were the top two places for lodging and meals.  A typical plate can cost anywhere between GNF35,000 and GNF55,000. Note that prices of food and drinks can often dramatically increase at the spur of the moment and without any explanation!\n\nFruits are very inexpensive here, especially compared to the higher costs in neighbouring countries (Mali, Ivory Coast and Senegal).  For those who love pineapples, on the national road (which literally goes from the North of the country to Conakry in the South) you can find people selling this tasty fruit very cheaply on the side of the road in and around Kindia. Mango fruits, oranges and bananas can also be found in abundance throughout the country and at a cheap rate, especially at road sides.\n\nAnother alternative to eating out is eating \"IN\".  Since Guineans are generally welcoming and friendly people you may be invited to their home to share a meal. Most Guineans eat together from one big dish.

Most of the crime is done by officials in military uniforms, and usually targets foreigners. Most non-violent crime involves acts of pick-pocketing and purse-snatching, while armed robbery, muggings, and assaults are the most common violent crimes. Criminals particularly target visitors at the airport, in the traditional markets, and near hotels and restaurants frequented by foreigners. Stay vigilant, and apply common sense if stuck in a difficult situation.\n\nVisitors should also avoid unsolicited offers of assistance at the airport and hotels because such offers often mask an intention to steal luggage, purses, or wallets. Travellers should arrange for hotel personnel, family members, or business contacts to meet them at the airport to reduce their vulnerability to these crimes of opportunity. \n\nWhen taking photographs, avoid military bases and political buildings, as it can be considered espionage in Guinea and can land you in jail.\n\nThe police are completely ineffective. Low salaries and improper training contribute to the lack of professionalism of the police. If you are the victim of a crime, consult your embassy.\n\nCorruption is extremely widespread - Corrupt police and soldiers target foreigners for bribes in just about any place in the country. Policemen will demand bribes at any checkpoint. Policemen will often intimidate you to pay bribes by confiscating a particular item. \n\nBusiness trips to Guinea are strongly discouraged.

A simple, \"Ca va\" will often suffice.  However, Guineans appreciate if you ask about their family, health and job\/studies: \"et la famille, la sante, le boulot\/les etudes.\"  Before getting to the point in a conversation, e-mail, etc. it is common and expected to greet somehow and ask how they are doing.\n\nGreet, eat and exchange money only with your right hand; the left hand is used for bathroom purposes and is considered unclean.\n\nThe gender issue is quite complex in Guinea to say the least. Even though Guinea is a slightly conservative, Muslim, male-dominated society, foreign female travellers will rarely face any sort of difficulties. Don't be surprised if you are proposed to a million times! Cat calls, whistles and other similar forms of harassment are rare in Guinea and frowned upon. Guinean males often give up their seat to females as a sign of respect, especially in people's homes, outdoor settings, etc. \n\nIn general, men are still higher up the social ladder than women and this is prevalent in all aspects of Guinean society (education, jobs, etc.). Don't be surprised if men are shown more consideration than women in daily life. Once it's known that you are a foreign woman (especially if you are a Black foreign female coming from the US, Europe, etc.), and not a local, you will usually be granted a higher level of consideration).\n\nFor women it is NOT advisable to wear clothing showing anything from the stomach to the knees! Shorts, see-throughs, mini skirts, bare midriffs are considered tasteless if worn in public. It's not uncommon to be met with hostile stares or looks of disapproval from local Guineans or even worse.  Tattoos and body piercings are not common and visitors are advised to cover them up when possible.  A head scarf, however, is not necessary.  Jeans (while still not very popular among Guinean women), long skirts and dresses, tank tops and short or long sleeved shirts are perfectly acceptable.\n\nThere is a Christian minority (mostly concentrated in the southern forest region); however, Muslims, Christians and others tend to co-exist peacefully with tolerance and respect.\n\nGuineans will often invite you to eat at their home.  This is a sign of respect and consideration for the visitor.  Accept the invitation where possible.  If you are unable, it's better to politely respond with a simple \"next time\" or \"prochainement\".  Simply showing up without an appointment at the home of a Guinean is not considered rude or impolite as it can be in the West.  Don't be alarmed if you find Guineans popping over to see how you are.  \n\nOverall Guineans are warm, friendly and hospitable and will come to your assistance where appropriate.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["West_Africa"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecountry"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["9.6"],["-11.4"],["zoom=7"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Guinea"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Guinea"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Africa\/Guinea\/"]]}]
