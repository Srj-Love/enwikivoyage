Voronet Monastery is known for its striking blue color and the depiction of Heaven and Hell.  Humor Monastery (Manastirea Humorului) is not as well preserved as Voronet, but it has an impressive guard tower which you can scale for a nice view.  Humor is also reachable by foot (allow 1.5 hours).  You can also take a maxitaxi (large van\/small bus) to Manastirea Humorului.  The maxitaxi leaves fairly regularly from the front of the Best Western hotel at the center of town.  Keep in mind there is no sign for the maxitaxi and no schedule, just look for a group of people gathered in front of the hotel.  The maxitaxi costs about 1 leu.  Taxis are also available.
