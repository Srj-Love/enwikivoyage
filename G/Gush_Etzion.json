It has a rich history dating back from the 1920s and 30s to recent times. An area full of natural springs, green hills, desert views, amazing landscapes and unforgettable sunsets, besides a small population and an even smaller number of tourists.\n\nSome attempts at Jewish settlement were made between 1927-1947 in the area, but during the Israeli independence war all the settlements were abandoned or destroyed. The renaissance began after the Six Day War in 1967, when the Israelis captured the area.\n\nNowadays, the area has 4 major areas: The main block, where lies the settlements of Bat Ayin, Alon Shevut, Kfar Etzion, Rosh Zurim, Elazar, Migdal Oz and Neve Daniel.

The main hitchiking hub is in the southern exit from Jerusalem, a place called \"Tzomet HaMinharot\". Any time between 6am and 1am, you're likely to be picked up by a Kippa-wearing, smiling nice guy which will take you for this 12-20 minutes ride. Good points to go to are Tzomet HaGush (Gush Etzion Junction) or Efrat Darom (southern entrance to Efrat).\n\nAnother option is to take the bullet-proof Egged buses. Leaving from central station in Jerusalem, lines 160, 161 and 164 leave every 30-60 minutes for Kiryat Arba (get down in Tzomet HaGush), Efrat and other settlements in the area. They are also stopping in the far side of Tzomet HaMinharot- don't forget to wave the driver!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get around "]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" See "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Herodium from above 2.jpg"],["280px"],["thumbnail"],["Herodium"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Herodium"]}," - a hill shaped like a truncated cone (758 m. above sea level) built as a fortress palace by King Herod the Great."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Biyar acqueduct"]}," in the valley between Efrat and Elazar, lies the Biyar acqueduct, which offers the visitors a chance to walk in an ancient underground tunnel for dozens of meters, partly in water."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["View above Bat Ayin"]}," on the road to Bat Ayin, just before the road starts its downhill, stop in the sunset and enjoy the views on any day.
