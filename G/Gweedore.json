The majority of locals are Irish speakers of some degree, with the vast majority of them counting Irish as their first language. All locals (except perhaps very young children and a few very elderly persons) also speak fluent English, so have no fear of not understanding or not being understood. You will hear English spoken regularly, and indeed even locals who speak Irish will sometimes choose to speak English to each other. \nIt is common to hear English spoken, but far more common to hear Irish (or a mixture of Irish and English) spoken among locals. \nA few Irish words here and there might go down well but any attempt to speak more than a few words of Irish is unnecessary unless you are looking to learn Irish. If you do wish to begin learning or to improve your Irish, there are many language schools in the area offering summer or Easter language courses for adults, children and teenagers. While Irish is a beautiful language, do be warned that Irish is a notoriously hard language to learn, even for local children, so don't expect to pick too much up in just a few weeks.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Teach Huidí Beag"]}," is nice, cosy pub that has traditional Irish music on Mondays and Friday nights in Bunbeg."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Leo's Tavern"]}," is the \"home of Clannad\", the world-famous Celtic music band, serving food all day.
