Much of the historic center dates to the days when Gyumri was an outpost of the Russian Czar in the Southern Caucasus, and the architecture reflects that.  The buildings, of dark black stone are primarily 1800s Russian in style, with Armenian touches.  Much of the center was destroyed by the 1988 quake which devastated the region, part of which has been rebuilt.  There are also Russian churches, cemeteries and a large Russian base still dominates a part of the city.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nVans called ",{"type":"''","value":["marshutni"]}," depart ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yerevan"]]}," for Gyumri from a parking lot next to Sasuntsi David subway station.  These are cheap, at about $4, but often crowded or uncomfortable.  They are, however a great way to meet locals.  Shared taxis depart from the same location and are usually faster and more comfortable.  Taxis can be taken from anywhere in Yerevan or, indeed Armenia.\n\nAnother good option for a visit to Gyumri is a day tour from Yerevan.  Many companies offer these, for a reasonable price, and allow you to get in a van, with other travelers and a guide, with stops along the way in places like Talin Cathedral and Harijavank Monastery.  This is probably the easiest option, and may even work out to be your cheapest compared to taxis.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nGyumri's historic town center is quite walkable, and fun to explore, but beyond that it is a bit of a sprawling town, and to see everything it has to offer in a day, a car is needed.  If you haven't come with your own, a taxi in town, with a meter, is probably your only realistic option, and a pretty good one at that.  If you care to try and figure out the numbers of the local van routes (marshutni), you can have quite an adventure.  It may be hard to make it to some of the fringe sites though in a marshutni, like the fortress.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Town Square"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Huge square in the middle of town, with a church, a cathedral, a massive government building, fountains, restaurants, and all adjacent to the old town with great architecture and some small museums."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Black Fortress"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=The big, round, black fortress on the top of the hill overlooking Gyumri is a good spot to take in the view.
