The gulf on the tip of which Göcek is located in known as one of the most beautiful yachting areas in the country, or even in whole Mediterranean basin.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nMost of what you see today as \"Göcek\" is actually a town purpose built on a grid plan in late 1980s\/early 1990s to boost and serve then newly-emerging tourism in the area, on what was then the coastal plains of the village of Göcek. Up to that date, much of the plains was covered with marshes and some farmland, along with a small port used for exporting logs harvested from surrounding forests for paper-milling and chromium ore, found abundantly and extracted since late 19th century in the surrounding mountains and the reason of many men from surrounding towns—who are now commemorated by a bronze mine worker statue at the town plaza—immigrating to look for a job at a time when, in the absence of tourism, there were little alternative ways of earning livelihood in this hilly region unfit for large agricultural operations.\n\nThe \"real\" village of Göcek, lying about 2-3 km uphill from waterfront and north of main highway, is still extant and retains its village atmosphere to some degree, with freely roaming sheepdogs and roosters here and there, and omnipresent mulberry trees casting their deep shadows much needed in this sunny and hot climate—quite a different world from the town centre, in short. However, the village itself is now being slowly engulfed by summer villas of urban dwellers from elsewhere.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nGöcek experiences an average of 300 days of sunshine annually—you will indeed be hard pressed to find a single cloud formation in the skies in long summer, when temperatures constantly range between 35",{"type":"[[","value":[["Metric and Imperial equivalents"],["°C"]]}," and 40°C during the day and no lower than 27°C during the night. Average winter—which, in fact, would be called \"spring\" really, in more northern climates—temperature is +17°C.\n\nWater temperature at the bay is more or less around 25°C on the average during summer.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\nNearest airport is located in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dalaman"]]},", which receives domestic as well as international flights.

This is, naturally, the best way to explore the coves of Göcek. If you don't own one, you can rent a yacht in town monthly or weekly.

Travellers prefering to head their beach on their own stream may check out ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ayten"]},", about 6 km west of the town (also attainable by car). Start your walk from in front of the factory with a big \"Mopak\" sign, then walk past the marshland (don't worry, you'll be walking on a wide tarmac road through it) and then the Club Marina. If Ayten is far too crowded for you, keep walking to find a secluded little cove. You'll come across one soon! Behind Ayten beach is a black hose with very cold water coming from the top of the mountain.
