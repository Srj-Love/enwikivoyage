Base camp sits at around 4,200m and takes about 6hrs to hike to. The elevation at the summit is 5,396m and takes about 8hrs to hike to from base camp. A local guide can be hired for ¥250 per day. Most if not all of the local guides do not speak English. Necessary equipment for the trek can all be rented. Ice picks, crampons and poles are a combined ¥200. Warm hat, gloves, coat and sunglasses are ¥50. Supplemental air can be purchased for ¥20 per canister but shouldn't be necessary for just the base camp trek. Spending the night at a dorm room at base camp costs ¥100. Dinner at base runs about ¥20. Most people attempt the summit in 2 to 5 days. Spending a day acclimatizing at Haba Village and\/or base camp is suggested if you're not used to the altitude.
