It is the county seat, and a center of government, legal activity, and commerce in the region.  Headquarters for The Record, a major newspaper published for the North Jersey region is in town.  \n\nHackensack is also notable for the eponymous Hackensack River where it flows almost parallel with the Hudson River for approximately 45 miles.

Anyone visiting should also make note that flooding is a major problem in Hackensack (and many surrounding towns, especially in Southern Bergen).  Just 15 minutes of steady downpour will make some roads flood, and a few hours of steady rain will surely make many roads impassable, especially River Street.  If you can avoid driving while it's raining or flooded, please do.  If not, try to use roads on higher ground towards Summit Avenue.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Hilton Hasbrouck Heights"],["url=http:\/\/www.hasbrouckheights.hilton.com"],["email="],["address=650 Terrace Ave, Hasbrouck Heights, NJ 07604"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone =+1 201 288-6100"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=Rooms from $104.00"],["checkin=3PM"],["checkout=12PM"],["content=Easy access to all major highways in New Jersey and into nearby Manhattan.
