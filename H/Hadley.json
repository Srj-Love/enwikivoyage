There are few official attractions, but those brave enough to wander will discover beautiful scenes just around the bend.\n\nFor example, a trip down Rocky Hill Road will have you pass fields which grow corn, pumpkins, or cabbage in different years. A minute or two farther will bring you to an old barn which now dries tobacco. On your right you'll pass a few homegrown farmstands, in season, offering vegetables or flowers. The trusting atmosphere is evident- nobody is there manning the stand. Drive further down this meandering road, past a field of sheep and some houses all but hidden behind shrub. One empty lot is an incredible sight at twilight, as thousands of fireflies call it home. A few minutes further down Rocky Hill Road bring you past an old cemetery, and finally to the border of Amherst as you near the campus stadium and see the towers up ahead.\n\nAny route will take you on a wonderful adventure -- perhaps to pick strawberries, go to a tag sale, or simply admire an opulent tree running through a rainbow before dropping its leaves in fall.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Joseph Skinner State Park"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.mass.gov\/dcr\/parks\/central\/skin.htm"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone =+1 413 586-0350"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Route 47.
