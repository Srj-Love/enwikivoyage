After travelling through several seemingly deserted villages you kind of have the feeling that you are travelling into the middle of nowhere. These temples are on the west coast and perched on top of the cliffs and overlooking the nature reserve of Filfla.  If you are expecting to see acres of temples, this is not the case, but what you do see is a number of carefully constructed stone rooms and structures which were built around 3000BC.  The sheer fact that they have survived all this time is quite amazing.  \n\nEntrance to both temples (Hagar Qim Temples and Mnajdra Temples) and the visitor centre cost 9 Euro per person. The visitor centre also houses a gift shop, a restaurant and other facilities. \n\nHagar Qim Temple in the nearest one to the road and access to this site is via a newly built visitor centre. Mnajdra is further down the cliff and there is about a 1 km walk downhill to the temples.  This is the older of the two temples with parts dating back to 3600BC.  This is a struggle if it is an extremely hot day as there is no shade whatsoever and you can easily get dehydrated. There are some beautiful views over the ocean and towards the little nature reserve island. \n\nYou can get the bus back to Valletta or attempt to walk down the hill to the Blue Grotto.  This is a nice walk with some stunning views, and takes probably about 20 minutes at a good pace.  But again, there is no shade, so have a good supply of water with you. You can then get the bus here back to Valletta.  Be careful of the Taxi's as they will tell you buses very rarely come and try to charge you 20E to drive you to the next town - don't be fooled by their helpfulness. During the day, buses go through Hagar Qim Park at least once every hour.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Malta Island"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["no Wikipedia link"]]}]
