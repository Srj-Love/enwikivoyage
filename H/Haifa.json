It is a seaport located on Israel's Mediterranean shoreline, below scenic Mount Carmel.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nHaifa is first mentioned historically around the 3rd century CE as a small town near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shikmona"]]},", the main Jewish town in the area at that time and a center for making the traditional Tekhelet dye used for Jewish Priests' temple cloth. The archaeological site of Shikmona lies southwest of the modern Bat Galim neighborhood. The Byzantine ruled there until the 7th century, when the city was conquered — first by the Persians, then by the Arabs. In 1100, it was conquered again by the Crusaders after a fierce battle with its Jewish and Muslim inhabitants. Under Crusader rule, the city was a part of the Principality of Galilee until the Muslim Mameluks captured it in 1265.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Haifa View.jpg"],["thumb"],["500px"],["View of Haifa, the edge of the carmel and Shrine of the Báb"]]},"\n\nIn 1761 Daher El-Omar, Bedouin ruler of Acre and Galilee, destroyed and rebuilt the town in a new location, surrounding it with a thin wall. This event is marked as the beginning of the town's modern era. After El-Omar's death in 1775, the town was under Ottoman rule until 1918, except for two brief periods. In the years following, Haifa grew in terms of traffic, population and importance, as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Akko"]]}," suffered a decline. The development of Haifa increased further with the arrival of members of the German Protestant Temple Society in 1868, who settled a modern neighbourhood near the city, now known as the \"German Colony\". The Templers greatly contributed to the town's commerce and industry, playing an important role in its modernization.\n\nBy the beginning of the 20th Century, Haifa had emerged as an industrial port city and growing population center, reflected by the establishment of facilities like the Hejaz railway and Technion. At that time Haifa District was home to approximately 20,000 inhabitants, comprised of 82% Muslim Arab, 14% Christian Arabs, and 4% Jewish residents. The Jewish population increased steadily with immigration primarily from Europe, and by 1945 the population had shifted to 38% Muslim, 13% Christian and 47% Jewish.\n\nToday, Haifa is home to Jews, Muslim and Christian Arabs, as well as small communities of Ahmadis (in Kababir), Druze (in nearby Isfiya and Daliyat al-Karmel), Bahá'ís, and others. Haifa is characterised as a mosaic of peaceful coexistence between the communities.\n\nThe phrase \"Haifa works, Jerusalem prays, and Tel Aviv plays\" refers to Haifa's reputation as a city of workers. A generation ago Haifa's image was that of a serious—and somewhat dull—labor city because of its many factories. It still has an industrial area to its north, where one of Israel's two oil refineries is located. But it also has a world-class high-tech strip in its south, in the \"Matam\" technology park along the beach. The park includes blue-chip tech firms such as Intel, Philips, Microsoft, and Google as well as some of Israel's largest tech firms, Elbit, Zoran, and Amdocs. IBM has an R&D center on the top of Mount Carmel at Haifa University and HP has a lab at the Technion, Israel's leading technological university.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nHaifa has its own airport, Haifa Airport which serves flights to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tel Aviv"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Eilat"]]},", although the closest and only international airport is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ben Gurion International Airport"]}," in Tel Aviv, where flights arrive from all over the world.

The \"sherut\" (taxi van with fixed routes and prices) also run on Saturdays in parallel with some bus routes, and is much more frequent.\n\nHaifa has two main bus terminals where passengers can switch between inter-city buses and trains to the local routes operated by Egged bus company ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/egged.co.il\/Eng\/"]},".\n\nThe two stations are:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"''","value":["Mercazit HaMifratz"]}," - (bay area hub) connecting Haifa with the Krayot (northern suburbs) and the Galilee.

Connecting bus fare is included if used within an hour and twenty minutes (ask for \"kartis ma'avar\").  Bus route 103 is useful as it runs along the coast, connecting the German colony with Dado beach. The main overground railway also runs along this route, with a journey from the central railway station to the Bat Galim station costing ₪5.\n\nA night bus route runs from midnight-5AM and on Fridays and Saturdays from 10.30PM-5AM. During the peak period (summertime) this route runs every night, but in the off-peak season it only runs on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights.\n\nIf you intend to use the bus regularly ask the driver for a \"Cartisiyah\" punch ticket (51.20 nis) which gives you 10 journeys for the price of 8.

It is the only subway in Israel. It is useful for getting up or down the mountain from downtown, but it only extends to a small part of Haifa. If you need to go further, you can buy a ticket which includes a transfer to a bus for the remainder of your journey, though it's probably more convenient to just take a bus the whole way. However, the Carmelit is worth taking for fun, to see its weird angled structure (steps in the stations and train cars, made necessary by the steepness of the mountain).

Wadi Nisnas has many restaurants and food stalls for shawarma, falafel, and Middle Eastern sweets like baklava and knafe.\n\nThere is a huge concentration of falafel and shawarma stands downtown on Yafo Street, near the old Bat Galim Central Bus Terminal building (about 400m from it). The food is cheap and authentic (about 10-15 Nis for a falafel, and around 20-22 for a shawarma in a pita).\n\nAnother cheap street food is the Bureka—a Turkish phyllo dough, filled pastry—which is almost as common as falafel. Price is also cheap, and it usually comes filled with cheese, potatoes, spinach and feta, or meat.\n\nFurther up the food chain are the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Middle Eastern\/Arabic restaurants"]},". Most are located downtown: Abu-Yousef (there are two with no relation ), Hummus Faraj, Hummus Abu-Shaker (on HaMeginim St.), Abu Maroun (in the flea market), Matza (a good place 10 minutes walking distance from the shopping mall \"Grand Canyon\"). They are all famous for their high quality hummus (which is regarded as the \"best of the best\" in Israel). Expect to pay 50-80NIS per person for a complete meal.\n\nThere are several ",{"type":"'''","value":["Romanian-style restaurants"]},"; in actuality this is a hybrid of Middle Eastern and Romanian cuisine. Most are located downtown: Ma'ayan HaBira (beer fountain), Cafe (coffee) Glida (icecream) Younek. Expect to pay 50-100NIS per person for a meal.\n\nJacko - one of the best fish restaurants (on Moriah Street and downtown near Natanson Street). It was a working-class restaurant until it became famous, and increased its prices a bit (80-120NIS per person).\n\nIsabella is a restaurant at the entrance of the German Colony. Isabella provides great seafood that caters to a western palate at a mid-range price.
