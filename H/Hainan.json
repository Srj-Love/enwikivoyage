[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Hainan Page Banner.png"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Hainan"]}," (海南) is an island province, the southernmost part of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China"]]},", just across the Gulf of Tonkin from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vietnam"]]},". \"Hainan\" literally means \"South of the Ocean.\"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nBack in the Qing Dynasty (up to 1911), Hainan was considered a backwater and used as a place of exile for failed officials.

It is being heavily promoted as \"China's Hawaii\". The entire island has been declared a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["List_of_Chinese_provinces_and_regions#Development_zones"],["Special Economic Zone"]]},". The island has been popular with Russian tourists for decades and now gets many tourists from the other cold parts of Europe as well.\n\nHainan is undergoing heavy tourist-oriented development with various international hotel chains establishing resorts, especially in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sanya"]]}," area. These days, many wealthy Chinese from the northern provinces own second homes in Hainan, where they move to in the winter to escape the bitter cold that characterises much of northern China.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Regions"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The ",{"type":"'''","value":["hilly center"]}," of the island is home to various ethnic minorities, with many involved in the tourist industry."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Much of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["coast"]}," has beaches."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Haikou"]]}," - in the North, the capital"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Baoting"]]}," - toward the South, in the hills"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bo'ao"]]}," - on the East coast"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lingshui"]]}," - on the East coast, place where the Hainan incident (an American spy plane forced down) occurred"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sanya"]]}," - in the South, main tourist destination"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wenchang"]]}," (文昌市) - in the north-east coast of Hainan Island"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wuzhishan"]]}," - in the central highlands"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yalong Bay"]]}," - resort area near Sanya"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Xiangshui or Perfume Bay - new resort area near Sanya"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Haikou"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sanya"]]}," have airports with regular flights to various Chinese cities. There are also some flights from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southeast Asia"]]},". There is a high-speed train that serves Haikou's Meilan Airport. See ",{"type":"''","value":["Get around"]}," section below.\n\nTrains run daily from Guangzhou, Beijing and Shanghai. The trains are loaded onto ferries to cross the sea with passengers remaining in the train cars. The trains stop at both Haikou and Sanya, as well as Dongfang, a smaller station between Haikou and Sanya.\n\nYou can also reach Hainan by boat. Buses take the ferry.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Haikou"]]}," at the North end and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sanya"]]}," at the South end are connected by three highways — East coast, West coast and through the hilly center. More-or-less any significant place on the island is on, or at least close to, one of these highways. As anywhere in China, there are buses to almost anywhere.\n\nTwo railways connect Haikou and Sanya. One is the old western ring railway, and the other one is the new high-speed eastern ring railway. Another high-speed western ring railway is under construction. High-speed trains run between Haikou and Sanya at up to 250 km\/h, takes one hour and a half between the two cities.\n\nAs the smallest province in China with relatively flat landscape, Hainan is an ideal destination for long journey cycling trip. On the East Coast it has a 300km long national road (G223) connecting Haikou, Wenchang, Qionghai, Lingshui and Sanya. The route, which is\npacked with most famous beach resorts and tourist attractions, is the easiest ride and most popular among amateur cyclists. The Middle route crossing Wushishan (Five-Finger Hill) takes some more toil to go. While it is possible to ride along the West coast, this area is the least developed and more preparation may be needed.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nAs anywhere in China, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chinese phrasebook"],["Mandarin"]]}," is the lingua franca; nearly everyone can speak it with the exception of some of the elderly.  Due to the proximity with Guangdong, some locals speak ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cantonese phrasebook"],["Cantonese"]]}," as well.\n\nThe main local language is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hainanese"]]},"; even other Chinese considered it difficult to learn as it employs many unusual consonants which have no equivalent in any other Chinese \"dialects\" or Western languages, and has an odd tone structure. Nevertheless, learn a little of the language if you can, as locals are very proud of their language, and even knowing a few basic greetings will get you acquainted with the locals much more easily. They realise that Hainanese is difficult even for native speakers of other Chinese \"dialects\", and much more so for foreigners, so they'll politely correct any pronunciation errors you make. Hainanese also has dialectal variations between different parts of the island, though the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wenchang"]]}," dialect is considered to be the prestige dialect, and is generally used in news reports and understood throughout the island.\n\nHainan also has significant numbers of speakers both of other Chinese dialects — the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Danzhou"]]}," region has its own local dialect and there are ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hakka"]]}," speakers on the island — and of unrelated languages. The Li people, who are the largest non-Han minority on the island, speak a language that is distantly related to Thai and Lao. There is also a Miao community on Hainan, which continues to speak the Miao language. Nevertheless, most younger people from these groups are also able to speak Hainanese and Mandarin as well.\n\nAs elsewhere in China, English is not widespread but some people speak it quite well. Staff at the main hotels and beach resorts will usually have a functional command of English. Hainan is a traditional destination for Russians escaping their winters, so many shop keepers and restaurant staff know some Russian, and much signage is in (bad!) Russian. However, trying to engage anyone in a conversation more often than not will prove fruitless.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Sea Turtles 911"],["url=http:\/\/www.seaturtles911.org"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=The only non-profit organization promoting sea turtle conservation in China, Sea Turtles 911's primary facility is a floating sea turtle hospital in Lingshui near Nanwan Monkey Island, as well as programs in Sanya and Haikou.
