It is located on the shores of the Lynn Canal, the state's longest fjord, and surrounded by glacier-covered mountains of the Coast Range.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nIf you loved the TV show \"Northern Exposure,\" you'll love the down-home feel of Haines. It's the kind of laid-back place you picture when you think about an Alaskan town. The first thing you'll notice when you arrive is how scenically beautiful Haines is.\n\nHaines is blessed with surrounding natural areas and wildlife in what is known as the \"Valley of the Eagles.\" The area is a magnet for bald eagles, drawn by the warm open water and abundant supply of salmon. More than 3,500 of the birds visit from October to February â€“ during that time a dozen eagles may share a single tree limb.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Haines Convention and Visitors Bureau"],["url=http:\/\/www.haines.ak.us\/"],["email="],["address=122 Second Ave S"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=near Willard St"],["phone=+1 907-766-2234; 800-458-3579"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Summer: M-F 8AM-7PM, and weekends 9AM-6PM"],["price="],["content=You can pick up the Haines Visitor's Guide, walking tour maps, e.g., for Fort Seward, and \"Haines is for Hikers\"."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nThere are three main ways to get to Haines, which makes Haines more accessible than most other southeast Alaskan communities of its size.  First, you can drive to Haines from Haines Junction, Yukon, of the Alaska Highway. If this is your route, Haines is the very end of the Haines Highway, about 155 miles.\n\nYou can fly into Haines, but there are no large commercial flights. More likely you will fly into Juneau on Alaska Airlines, and from there catch a smaller bush carrier or charter a flight.  The Haines Airport is on the Haines Highway about 4 miles west of town.\n\nThe third, and probably most popular, way to Haines is by boat.  The primary mode of inter-Alaskan transportation is by the Alaska Marine Highway.  The Lynn Canal route of the ferry system (Juneau-Haines-Skagway) receives a large amount of ferry traffic, especially in the summer.  The Haines state ferry terminal at 2112 Lutak Road is about 4 miles north of town.\n\nRecently, Haines became a port-of-call to cruise ships, only about 20 calls per season, mainly from the Holland-America Line.  The cruise ship docks at the Port Chilkoot Wharf, at the foot of Portage St below Fort Seward.  If you are on a cruise that visits Haines, you can rest assured that your ship will be the only ship in port and there won't be any large crowds to contend with in town.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nHaines is small enough that you can easily walk around the town in an hour or two.\n\nDuring cruise ship dockings, there is a Shuttle Bus service that runs every 30 minutes.  It starts at the Port Chilkoot Dock, and makes a loop to the Sheldon Museum, Visitor Center, Library, Dalton City, Eagle Foundation, Fort Seward Historic District, and then back to the Dock.\n\nThere are no taxis in Haines. Occasionally there is one when someone tries to start a taxi business, but they don't survive. You will need a car, a bike, a shuttle service, or make a friend quick.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Fort William H.

The Fort is also referred to as Port Chilkoot, a leftover from the Port Chilkoot Company, which was formed after World War II by a group of investors who purchased the Fort from the Federal Government.  An increasing number of restaurants, lodges, and art galleries are utilizing the original buildings; e.g., the Fort's hospital is now the Alaska Indian Arts Center.  Within the parade ground is Totem Village. Although not part of the original fort, it includes two tribal houses and totem poles and is the home of the Chilkat Storytellers Theater Show, an hour-long performance of Alaska Native dramatization.  A walking-tour map of the Fort is available at the Visitors Bureau, or you can just read the historical panels that have been erected there."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=American Bald Eagle Foundation"],["url=http:\/\/www.baldeagles.org\/home"],["email="],["address=2nd Ave S and Haines Hwy"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 907-766-3094"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=$10 to $3"],["content=The American Bald Eagle Foundation contains a Natural History Museum featuring dioramas and (opened in 2010) a Live Raptor Center featuring live bird presentations."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Sheldon Museum & Cultural Center"],["url=http:\/\/www.sheldonmuseum.org\/"],["email="],["address=11 Main St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=near Front St on original Haines Mission grounds"],["phone=+1 907  766-2366"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Summer: M-F 10AM-5PM, weekends 1-4PM."],["price=Admission: $5 adult, children less than 12 free"],["content=The Sheldon Museum is a cultural and historical center for the  \nNative Tlingit art and culture, Haines history (Mission, Eldred \nRock Lighthouse lens, Army, local industries, people), and the \nwork of local artists.
