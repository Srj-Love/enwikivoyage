The Saudi government has a ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.hajinformation.com\/ ministry"]}," to manage it.\n\nDespite it being illegal for non-Muslims, a few Western explorers have managed the journey — most notably, Sir Richard Burton made the Hajj in 1853 and wrote an ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/4657 account of the trip"]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Prepare "]},"\n\nUnless you are a citizen of Saudi Arabia you will need a visa, obtained in advance from a Saudi embassy.

Yellow fever vaccination is required if you arrive from any country with known yellow fever infections, and polio vaccinations are required for children up to 15.

They are enormous tents of fiberglass fabric on reinforced concrete poles and steel cables. At Hajj time, there are dozens of large aircraft parked alongside these terminals. These are used only for the Hajj; the airport has another terminal for normal travel. Driving to the regular terminal, you pass between the two Hajj terminals.\n\nFrom Jeddah — for most pilgrims, directly from the airport — there are buses to Mecca. Many are painted in the yellow and black pattern used on school buses in North America; seeing dozens of those on the highway is a strange sight if you know them as school buses. Buses are also used for the trip from Mecca to Medina and back; Saudi Arabia has not had a railway since Lawrence and the lads blew up the Turkish one during the First World War.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Route "]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Hajj1.gif"],["frame"],["The Hajj route in and around Mecca"]]},"\nOnce at Mecca, the traditional Hajj route is as follows:\n\n# ",{"type":"''","value":["Miqat"]},", or changing into the pilgrims' ",{"type":"''","value":["ihram"]}," clothes\n# ",{"type":"''","value":["Tawaf az-Ziyarah"]},", walking around the Kaaba four times at a fast pace and three times at a slow pace, and ",{"type":"''","value":["Sa`y"]},", walking seven times back and forth between the hills of Safa and Marwah (both rituals within the ",{"type":"''","value":["Masjid al-Haram"]},", the main mosque)\n# On the 8th day of the month (8 Zil Hijjah and first day of Hajj), moving to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mina"]]},", camping overnight and spend the night in prayer\n# On the 9th, the ",{"type":"''","value":["Wuquf"]},", journey to Arafat and spending the day in prayer.
