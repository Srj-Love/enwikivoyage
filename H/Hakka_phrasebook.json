[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Welcome banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Hakka"]}," (客家话; Kèjiāhuà in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mandarin"]]},") is one of the main seven or so Chinese languages. It is spoken across several provinces in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southeast China"]]},", including ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fujian"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guangdong"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hainan"]]},", and also in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Taiwan"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong"]]}," and in the Chinese diaspora. In this article, the Hong Kong dialect of the Hakka language will be used.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Brief Overview"]},"\nThe Hakka (客家 Kèjiā, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["IPA"]]},": [hak₃ ka₃₃] ) people migrated South from Northern China over the centuries to settle in southern ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jiangsu"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hunan"]]},", western ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fujian"]]},", eastern ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guangdong"]]},", and various other areas, due to wars, famine, natural disasters, and political persecution.\n\nHakka comes from the words '客' \"guest\" and '家' \"families\" which derives from an official term during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) for the program of resettlement of the coastal areas of Guangdong after evacuation orders imposed during the reign of Emperor Kangxi. These settlers whose language was different to the original inhabitants were given this appellation to show they were not indigenous to the areas they became settled in. The indigenous inhabitants (",{"type":"''","value":["punti"]},") had generally occupied the more fertile basins, so the incoming Hakka often settled in the more inaccessible valleys and mountainous or hilly terrain.\n\nIn some areas, the Hakka built ",{"type":"''","value":["tulou"]},", earth and straw round houses. These fascinating, centuries-old buildings are home to a whole clan and are easily defended. The largest groups of tulou, in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yongding County"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fujian"]]},", are now on the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["UNESCO World Heritage List"]]},".\n\nTo a considerable extent, Hakka have their own culture, different from their neighbours. In Neal Stephenson's novel ",{"type":"''","value":["Ream De"]},", much of which takes place in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Xiamen"]]},", one character is a Hakka lass from a tea-growing mountain area, and she is sometimes called a \"big-foot woman\" in reference to the fact that, unlike other Chinese, the Hakka never adopted the custom of foot-binding. \n\nThe Hakka language (客家话; Kèjiāhuà) shares a common vocabulary with Southern languages such as Min and Yue, and there are regular sound correspondences to the historical sound system of Middle Chinese.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Pronunciation guide"]},"\n\nThe most accessible Hakka speakers are found in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Most of them will be dual language speakers, in Hong Kong, they are able to understand and speak Cantonese, whilst on the mainland of China and on Taiwan, they will also speak Mandarin. There is no standard form of Hakka and regional variations in local dialects can be surmounted by understanding the gist of the spoken sentence and knowing some sound correspondences that the user will encounter.\n\nThere are some sounds in Hakka which do not occur in English. The following pronunciation guide aims to rhyme English words with the sounds found in the Hakka syllable. Please note they are approximations, you may require a Hakka speaker to guide your pronunciation.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Vowels"]},"\n\nThe vowels can be long or short. Long vowels occur in open syllables, where there are no endings.
