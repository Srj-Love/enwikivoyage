In order from south to north, they are called Aoki-ko, Nakazuna-ko, and Kizaki-ko.  The use of engines and outboard motors is banned on Aoki-ko, making it the quietest and nicest of the three.  Popular activities include boating, sport fishing, and windsurfing. Nakazuna-ko is very small and only really attracts fishermen.  Kizaki-ko is the most developed, and since engines are allowed, sports like wakeboarding are popular.\n\nDuring the summer, most of the ski resorts operate some of their lifts to allow access to higher elevations.  At Hakuba 47 and Aokiko (in nearby Omachi), the lifts allow access for mountain biking.  Hiking or simply enjoying the views are popular at Happo, Goryu and Tsugaike.  Above Happo, an easy trail extends for 40 minutes to a small pond in which the local alpine peaks are reflected.  A couple of hours further up the trail lies the peak of Mt. Karamatsu on the main ridge of the North Alps.  The top ski run at Goryu becomes an alpine garden in summer and another trail leads further upward to a viewpoint (around 50 minutes) or the peak of Mt. Goryu itself (around four hours).  Above Tsugaike, a further ropeway takes you to a wetland that is designated as a national park.  A trail from here takes you up to Mt. Shirouma, after which Hakuba is named.  Shirouma and Hakuba are different readings of the kanji for \"white horse\".  The smaller ski field of Iwatake uses its pistes to grow thousands of lilies in summer and also has a dry ski slope if you're desperate for turns.\n\nLike all mountain areas in Japan, temperatures in Hakuba stay much cooler than in the cities on Japan's Pacific coast. That alone makes it worthy of a visit.\n\nHakuba, located in Nagano Prefecture, equally central to Osaka, Nagoya and Tokyo and nestled at the base of the Northern Japan Alps is towered over by the Three Peaks which provide a stunning backdrop year round. While Hakuba is world famous for it's snow and boasts more than 10 resorts, the green season offers plenty to those craving an escape from the confines of Japan in general.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nWhether you're a snowboarder or skier, beginner or pro, with seven ski resorts in the area you shouldn't have problems finding a run to suit your style. \n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Hakuba 47 Winter Sports Park"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.hakuba47.co.jp\/e\/"],["email="],["address=24196-47, Kamishiro, Hakuba Village"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=",{"type":"''","value":["+81"]}," 261-75-3533"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Open 8.30AM to 4.30PM daily, Dec-May approx"],["price="],["content= With an annual snowfall of over 10m, Hakuba 47 offers 23 name runs, from beginner to advanced, as well as snowshoe and snowmobile tours.
