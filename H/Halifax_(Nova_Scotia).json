Seafood is generally not much cheaper in the Maritimes than elsewhere, however many restaurants in Halifax specialize in seafood dishes. The exception to seafood being the same price in Nova Scotia are mussels. They are generally good quality, cheap and found on many appetizer menus. Another seafood worth having is scallops, as they are generally higher quality than the ones you get in many parts of North America (note that good scallops are the size of a golf ball or larger, and do not taste fishy). \"Sea pie\" is often a good deal when available, as are hearty eats like fish and chips or seafood chowder. Lobster in a restaurant will be expensive, so your best cheap bets are to buy one at the store and cook one yourself, or attend any of the numerous lobster dinners that are hosted by churches and community groups throughout the warmer months. Buying lobster from the various fishermans markets or directly from the fisherman themselves (who will often sell street side out of a car) will get you the best deal. \n\nHowever, there are two unique food items that originated in the Halifax region: the Donair, and garlic fingers. The donair was introduced to Canada in the early 1970s in Halifax, with the opening of the iconic 'King of Donair' restaurant. The donair is similar to the doner kebab, but uses beef instead of lamb, a sweet sauce instead of garlic sauce, and is traditionally topped with diced tomatoes and white onions. \n\nMany Atlantic Canadian restaurants offer a donair pizza featuring all of the donair ingredients served on a pizza crust. In Atlantic Canada one can also find donair meat used in offerings such as donair sausage, donair egg rolls (an egg roll casing stuffed with donair meat), donair pogos (donair meat on a stick, battered and deep-fried, similar to a corn dog), donair calzones\/panzerottis, and in donair poutine. It is customary for bar and pub goers to flock to 'pizza corner' (Blowers & Grafton St) once all of the bars, clubs, and pubs close on Friday and Saturday nights for a bite of pizza, or especially donair.\n\nGarlic fingers are an Atlantic Canadian dish, similar to a pizza in shape and size and made with the same type of dough.\nInstead of the traditional tomato sauce and toppings, garlic fingers consist of pizza dough topped with garlic butter, parsley, and cheese, cooked until the cheese is melted. Bacon bits are also sometimes added. They are often eaten as a side dish with pizza, dipped in donair or marinara sauce. Instead of being cut in triangular slices, they are presented in thin strips or, \"fingers.\"\n\nBoth the donair and garlic fingers are relatively unknown outside of the maritime provinces of Canada, and are sometimes copied unsuccessfully in restaurants of other provinces.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Budget"]},"\nMany of the cheap eats in town are along Spring Garden road.
