Its history and culture, as with nearly all of Indiana's Lake Michigan coast, is inextricably linked to a big blue-collar industrial workforce. While the industrial economy is not what it once was, Hammond is still in decent shape, with a big new casino drawing in visitors from the Chicagoland area. Most visitors will find themselves passing through or on business, but Chicagoans would do well to include it in a close-in Lake County day trip, if for no other reason than to get some good food, perhaps stock up on fireworks, and realize that Chicagoland doesn't stop at the state line!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nThe ",{"type":"''","value":["big"]}," highways cutting east west across the city are I-90 and I-94\/I-80, both of which head east towards ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gary"]]}," and I-65 towards ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Indianapolis"]]},", and west towards ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chicago"]]}," and its south suburbs.
