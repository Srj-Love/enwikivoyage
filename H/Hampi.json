For the first time visitors, it is highly recommended to take a guide along with you, because the magic and granduer of the place is fully understood only when one knows the history and legends associated with the place.\nBefore the fall of Vijayanagar empire, diamonds were sold on the streets. The main street selling diamonds and other precious stones, was surprisingly called Pan Supaari Street (translated in English it means betel-leaf betel-nut street). A visitor can still see the exact location of Pan Supaari Street in Hampi, which has been marked with a board by Archaeological Survey of India.\n\nHampi is well worth at least a single visit. The area is simply stunning and you will be in awe of the millions of boulders surrounding the area. However, within this arid landscape lies a little oasis with lush palm, banana, and mango trees nestled near the river.\nHampi is a great place to spend a few days wandering around and discovering the rich, vibrant history while also having a bit of 'your' time.\n\nHampi hosts the 'Hampi Utsav' every year during first week of November.

With all the boulders, big and small around, with soil from years of erosion, there is a lot of dust that blows in the air. There are open spaces with strong winds and while the wind keeps you pleasant, you can have a lot of dust blowing into your nose \/ mouth. In many of the monument areas, there are no trees or anything to provide shade (except the monuments themselves). So walking \/ cycling around the area involves a lot of exposure to direct sunlight.

Helmet and lock is included in the price. Please note that with bicycling little bit of walking is always required for exploring sites inside out.\n\nRegular, non-geared cycles are available at Rs. 50 per day, no security deposit is required. These cycles are available at the Hampi village.\n\nAnother more convient variant is to see all the sights without climbing the hills is by Rikshaw. Bargain with your Rikshaw driver for a fixed rate (400-500 for a full day seems to be okay) and then hire an official Karnataka Travel guide (at the tourist office, they have fixed rates: 4h - 500Rs, 8h - 800Rs.) It costs a little bit, but the explanations help you to see more than just stones and temples. To get an estimate of cost\/content, you can talk to the guides before coming down to Hampi.

Dry dry heat. And the walk between some sites can be at least 5 km. Plus, the surrounding area is quite breathtaking to ride around and you can explore some parts that the rickshaws won't take you. Guides are willing to ride on the back with you as well. This is a more expensive option (not for the thrifty!) than the rickshaw but it gives you more freedom and you can cover more in one day without rushing it. Take a guide with you one day, then do it all again by yourself the next.  A bike like a scooty or kinetic honda will cost you about Rs150 a day with additional fuel charges. You can also hire a 100CC motor bikes for Rs 200 a day. A liter of petrol will be sufficient for sight seeing around Hampi, but two liters would be handy if you have plans to go to Tungabadra Dam (some 15 km from Hampi)\n\nWhen renting a scooters\/motor bikes petrol costs extra, and normally sold at 40-50% premium in the place you rent (A liter may cost Rs 65-75). A petrol pump is located in Kamalapur, which sells petrol at ordinary price. Two litres will get you to the major sites around Royal Centre and back, but three litres is a safer option.

Otherwise, you can hire and auto to do local sight seeing. It would cost you around Rs 400-Rs 500.\n\nTungbhadra dam is another 16 km from Hampi and it is towards Hospet. Hence, if you have plans to catch your train\/bus back from Hospet, you could see Tungbhadra dam and return from Hospet. It takes around 45 min to 1 hr to see Tungbhadra dam.

There is a road alongside old broken bridge (Bukka's Aqueduct).The Hanuman Temple on Anjenaya Hill (involves climbing up 572 steps, is believed to be the birthplace of Hanuman) and the Pampa Sarovar are worth a visit. Both of these places are around 7-8 km from Old broken bridge.\n\nThere is Daroji bear sanctuary around 16 km from Hampi, opposite side of Kamalapura\/Hospet. It opens between 1PM to 6PM Not a must see but you can go there for a nice drive\/ride if you have some time to kill.\n\nTo do justice to all the sites, one needs a minimum of 3 full days of sight seeing.
