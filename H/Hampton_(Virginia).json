McFaddens, Saddle Ridge and Saddle Ridge's more live music oriented Cheyenneâ€™s all share a block of store front right not to Cold Stone Creamery.  Joe's Crab Shack and Lonestar Steakhouse and Saloon also rest in this shopping center if you wanted to grab a few drinks out with dinner before you head over to the bars.  There are always plenty of taxi cabs and people to meet.\n\nTidemill Sports Bar - A little known hole in the wall (unless you're a local) karaoke and sports bar off of Armistead.  Heading away from Mercury Blvd you pass the Hampton Roads Center Parkway on your left and it's in the next shopping center on your right.  Plenty of parking and fun people.
