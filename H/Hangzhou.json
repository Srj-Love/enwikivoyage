However, if you download and use the Google Maps app on your mobile phone, it is quite easy to find directions, track your movement, and navigate your way around the Hangzhou bus system. The routes and bus numbering shown in Google Maps are very accurate for Hangzhou. Hangzhou taxis are notoriously expensive compared to other Chinese cities, and using the public bus system will save you money.\n\nThere are a number of bus types:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["Routes without a letter prefix generally have no air conditioning (though there are some exceptions, like route 900), and should therefor be avoided May–September.

The fare will be displayed in Western numerals on the bus stop and on the farebox.\n\nYou are expected to board via the front doors and leave through the rear (with the exception of the B routes). Buses have very little empty space even when they are not full (which is not common) so do not plan on bringing baby strollers or other cumbersome items. Be prepared at all times for fast turns and\/or deceleration. The suspension usually is not up to modern standards, and the drivers are aggressive.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nHangzhou has a large number of taxis which allow for quick and convenient travel within the city proper. Most of the city's taxis are turquoise-green in color and easily identifiable by the word ",{"type":"''","value":["Taxi"]}," printed in both English and Chinese on the vehicles. Taxis for hire are marked by the green (or sometimes yellow-orange) light-up signs above the dashboard on each car.\n\nHangzhou taxi drivers almost always use the meter as required by law. Trips start at ¥11 and are priced by the kilometer, with surcharges for idling time and trips over 10 km. It is advisable to take a receipt each time use you a taxi, should you wish to contact the taxi company or driver at later time to dispute a fare, recover a lost article, etc. Avoid the taxi touts at the train station and major tourist attractions, and instead, use the designated taxi queue or flag one off the street.\n\nFew, if any, of the city's taxi drivers speak English or any other foreign language. It is therefore important that you be able to point out your destination on a map, present the driver with the name of the destination (in written Chinese), or properly pronounce the name of the destination in spoken Mandarin Chinese. If you have a Chinese acquaintance whom you can reach by cell phone, you can allow him or her to speak to your driver through the phone to convey the desired information.\n\nHangzhou taxis are not allowed to carry more than four passengers, although you may be able to convince or bribe a driver to allow you to \"hide\" an extra passenger in the backseat. This can be worth the trouble or expense if it saves your group from needing to take two taxis.\n\nIt is also not unusual, especially at late or slow hours for the taxi driver to collect multiple fares to make the journey more worth their while. This will normally be explained in Chinese. This is uncommon at normal hours, however.\n\nTaxis, like all public transportation, are difficult to come by during the tourist weeks (Chinese New Year, May Golden Week, and October National Week); also, taxis at 07:30-08:45 and 16:30-19:00, and every time it rains, are difficult to flag, as they are always full or in the middle of a shift change. A taxi with an imminent shift change (usually ~ 15:00-17:00) will be showing a plate in the windscreen (Chinese characters of course) and will only take you if your route coincides with theirs. Being familiar with areas that taxis frequent or places where taxi passengers are likely to be dropped off at will aid you in finding a ride. Do not be visibly upset that your hailing position will be gazumped by a new arrival 20 metres up the road. The only rule is; it is the quick and the dead.\n\nTaxi drivers will also negotiate for long distance trips, or full-day\/half-day hiring. A trip to Pudong airport in Shanghai will be ¥600-1,000 depending on time of day or night.\n\nIn outer centres of Hangzhou, small five seater vans are usually available at bus terminals for onward transfers.

They will take you anywhere at a negotiated price.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By subway"]},"\nA total of 8 lines covering over 200 km have been planned. Line 1 opened in late 2012.

In the past, the most common means of transporting for HangZhounese are taking bus, riding borrowable bikes, driving cars or traveling on foot. Now we can simply take subways to the places we want.

The boats stop first at Xinyifang, then to the newly developed Canal Culture Square, where you can see the Canal Museum, see if there are any events in the square, and check out the new Xiaohe Street- a series of \"historical\" alleys with shops and restaurants similar to Hangzhou's Hefang Street; the area's renovation was completed in 2008. Cost is ¥3.\n\nWhile really worth taking the trip, Hangzhou now has plans to connect a series of canals and streams throughout the city with the Grand Canal, West Lake, Yuhang River, and Qiantang River, making for increased water transport and a Venetian feel when completed.\n\nThere are also passenger boats running along the Grand Canal from near the Qiantang River\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Getting to the islands on West Lake,"]}," you get to choose between tourist trap Dragon or \"Gaily-painted\" pleasure boats (¥45 and ¥35).

All but small side roads have dedicated bike lanes, often divided from motor traffic by barricades or medians.\n\nFor stays in Hangzhou, making use of the city's extensive public bike system can be a cheap and convenient way to experience the city. These fire engine red public bikes are ubiquitous on the street of Hangzhou, and the rental stations that dispense them are generously spread across the core of the city and around West Lake, stretching all the way up to the suburbs and down to the river near the Six Harmonies Pagoda. \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Hangzhou Bicycle Rental.JPG"],["thumb"],["Bicycles one can rent from Hangzhou's bike system; they aren't the best for anyone over 6', but one can manage.

If you have trouble finding it, go to the Hyatt and ask for directions; they will point you down the correct street. As well, each bike station will give out free tourist maps including a bike map that shows all the bike stations around the city. To obtain a value card (aka IC card), one must present an ID (such as a passport) and pay ¥300, 200 of which is a deposit with the remaining 100 to cover rentals fees. Bikes may then be rented by tapping the card against one of the automated bike racks holding the bikes. A beep and the audible sound of the rack unlocking will indicate that the bike can be removed. One can use any of the available bike racks scattered about the city if he or she wishes to visit an attraction or get a new bike. The bike is free for the first hour, ¥1 an hour for the two hours after that, and ¥3 an hour thereafter. For example, if one rents a bike for six hours, he or she will return to the main bicycle \"hub\" and receive ¥289 of his deposit back, which covers the ¥11 worth of bike riding.\n\nIC Cards or the bike rental cards can also be used on local buses (9% discount on public buses). More than one person may use the same card for their bus fare. Simply swipe the card the number of times equivalent to the number of people getting on the bus.\n\nBe careful to choose a bike with air in the front and back wheels, working brakes and appropriate seat height.  However none of the bikes were designed for reasonably tall people, so if you have long legs you may end up chaffing your knees on the handlebars.  During rush hour, local residents also actively use the bikes. Therefore, most bike stalls will be full and you might not easily find a station with empty racks to return your bike.\n\nBikes are returned by reinserting them into an empty bike rack and tapping one's card against the top of the rack. Another beep, a solid green light, and the sound of the rack locking will indicate when the bike has been received successfully. Make sure the bike rack lock receives your bike; it is doesn't, the bike won't be registered returned in the system, and you will lose both your bike rental and deposit money and get no refund. The system opens for business at 6:00, and bikes not returned by 9PM each night must be taken back to the Longxiang Qiao location (24hr), so keep an eye on the clock during evening rides. After ten days from purchase of the card, it may be returned for an 89% refund.\n\nIt is perfectly alright to rent bikes and return it within the hour and then immediately rent another bike so you never have to pay a dime.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Maps"]},"\n\nBuy maps near the Train Station or Bus Station from street vendors or stalls when you arrive.

You can find pinyin maps at foreign language bookstores and magazine stalls near the West Lake. The main foreign language bookstore in Yan An Road  has a reasonable selection of maps as well as travel books.\n\nThere is a useful 'what's on' magazine called ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.morehangzhou.com More Hangzhou"]}," that has a good pull-out map in Chinese and English.
