Once a city of modern buildings, wide thoroughfares, numerous parks and gardens, it suffered from increasing disrepair thanks to Zimbabwe's economic downward spiral.

Most service stations close at around p.m. although there are a number that offer 24-hour service.\n\nTaxis: in 4+1 style taxis, it is very common to fit as many as 8 people inside.
