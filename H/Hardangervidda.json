The endless highland plateau of Hardangervidda is about 8500 km², which is 20% the size of the Netherlands. Hardangervidda national park covers 3,422 km² (1321 square miles). Hardangervidda is famous for the large herds of wild reindeer. An extensive net of hiking paths and thousand lakes and rivers cover the vast highland plateau.   \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nPeople probably came to Hardangervidda at the same time as the reindeer, after the last Ice Age. About 250 Stone Age sites have been found, the oldest dating from 6300 BC. Finds from excavations of Stone Age sites show that the people hunted reindeer and ptarmigan.  Moose and trout bones were also found.\n\nToday, the natural resources on Hardangervidda are very valuable for the surrounding villages.\n\nHardangervidda National Park was established in 1981. It differs from other Norwegian national parks because it has been used a great deal by local people, has many buildings and much privately owned land. Consequently, people use motorized vehicles to harvest resources like fish and game, to upkeep buildings and to run lodges and huts for hikers and skiers. Large flocks of sheep graze Hardangervidda each summer. Both locals and tourists come to Hardangervidda to fish and hunt, as a source of food or recreation.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Hallingskeid stasjon oktober 2007.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Hallingskeid station. This treeless, endless view is typical for the mountain plateau."]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\nHardangervidda is a barren, treeless mountain plateau at 1100-1200 metres (3600-3900 feet) elevation, with lakes, moors, rivers and streams. There are significant differences between the west side, which is dominated by rocky terrain and expanses of bare rock, and the east side, which is much flatter and more heavily vegetated. The prominent peak of Hårteigen 1,690 m (5,545 ft) is visible across much of the plateau. \n\nAbout 550 million years ago, the plateau was submerged. Gradually a sheet of rock drifted over the seabed, was compressed, folded and rose from the sea. What is now Western Norway rose the most, and greater erosion created deeper valleys, fjords and steeper mountains than in the east. Glaciers and melting ice at the end of the last ice age chiselled out the landscape we see today.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\nThe whole of the Hardangervidda is above the tree line. Its alpine climate enables the presence of many species of arctic animals and plants further south than anywhere else in Europe.\n\nNorway is, to all extents and purposes, the only country in Europe with remaining vestigial populations of the original wild mountain reindeer. Wild reindeer need Hardangervidda. The 9000 wild reindeer (2009) here make up more than a quarter of all the wild reindeer in Norway. The large, continuous unspoiled area makes Hardangervidda particularly attractive to wild reindeer. Because the herds migrate between seasonal pastures and calving areas over the course of the year, they need a wide area. Wild reindeer are at their most vulnerable on the winter pasture and in the calving season in May.  You might think it is easy to spot one of Hardangerviddas 9000 wild reindeer, but that is not the case. They are shy. If you see a herd, consider yourself very lucky. Don’t try to follow them, but stand quietly and enjoy this rare sight.\n\nThe flat landscape with its numerous lakes and wetlands distinguishes Hardangervidda from other mountainous\nareas in southern Norway. Trout is the most common fish. The largest populations of many kinds of ducks and other wetland species in southern Norway, live here. The breeding populations of black-throated divers, scaups, velvet scoters, common scoters, dotterels, Temminck’s stints, great snipes and shore larks are particularly valuable.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nThe climate is considerably wetter on the west side than on the east. At any time of year, be prepared for sudden changes. The weather in Hardangervidda National Park can change very rapidly from sunny and warm to cold and rainy or even snowy, so it's important to bring along extra layers of clothing, like wool underwear and wind- and waterproof outerwear. For most people, late spring, summer and fall are the best times of year to visit Hardangervidda. Easter skiing across Hardangervidda is also popular, but is recommended for experienced skiers only. The winter storms can be challenging even for polar explorers like Amundsen. Many of the villages and cities surrounding Hardangervidda are popular all year round destinations.    \n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Summer"]},": June to August.
