In recent years, it has been one of the safest places in what the rest of the world still considers to be Somalia.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nHargeisa, with 1,200,000 inhabitants (according to a 2000 estimate), is the capital of the self-declared republic of Somaliland. Apart from the occasional couch surfer, there is very little tourism (and no tourist industry), as almost all visitors are working for an NGO or other organization. The city is a peaceful and friendly place, but does require some planning to ensure a successful visit.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Hargeisa airport.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Hargeisa International Airport"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Hargeisa International Airport (HGA)"]}," connects the city with a variety of locations in East Africa, all of which are subject to change. Recently, destinations have included ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Addis Ababa"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Djibouti (city)"],["Djibouti"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dubai"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bossaso"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mogadishu"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dire Dawa"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wajir"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nairobi"]]},". Note that some flights (especially those which \"connect\" in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Berbera"]]},") begin with a three-hour bus journey to Berbera, followed by the flight. It's best to confirm that the airline you use actually flies in and out of Hargeisa.\n\nHargeisa airport has a very comfortable departure lounge, equipped with a cafe, toilets, television and Internet access. Buy a copy of the local English language newspaper from the paper boy for local news while you wait.\n\nA Somaliland visa is required for foreign travellers. These can be obtained at the Somaliland representative offices in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Addis Ababa"]]}," (in person) or London (in person or by post). See the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Somaliland#Get in"],["Get in"]]}," section of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Somaliland"]]}," page for further information. Note that there is very little diplomatic representation in Hargeisa, so you should have your onward travel plans arranged (and visas in hand) before you travel to Hargeisa.\n\nAll arriving foreigners are required to exchange US$50 to Somaliland shillings, though this is not always enforced at land borders. The exchange rate at the airport is intentionally poor, so the exchange functions as an arrival tax. You will not be able to change your shillings back to US dollars at the airport when you leave, so make sure to use all of your shillings during your trip. The only notes currently in widespread use are the 500 shilling notes. Because of the exchange rate, you will end up with a large stack of notes when you change money at the airport.\n\nYou will also be required to pay an additional arrivals tax in addition to the money exchange. This is frequently an odd number, such as US$3 (in April 2011), so it would be a good idea to bring a lot of small notes with you (if you bring a bunch of US$100 notes, for example, you will have great difficulty finding change). The actual cost of the arrival tax appears to vary depending on the type of visa you have and where you got it.\n\nSome air tickets can be reserved at the site of ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.jubba-airways.com\/ Jubba Airways"]},", or with ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/eastafrican.easytravelpoint.com\/ibe\/ East African Safari Air Express"]}," (reservations@easa.co.ke or +254 020 6654321). Some flights are expensive; for example, a return flight from Nairobi to Hargeisa on East African costs US$600 as of April 2011. East African's flights NBO-HGA-NBO operate on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays (also as of April 2011) and are considered to be the best and most reliable way to reach Hargeisa.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Mapframe"],["9.5511"],["44.0675"],["zoom=13"]]},"\n\nHargeisa has an informal shared bus service which costs 1,500 Somaliland Shillings per journey (as of April 2011). Ask a local for instructions. Hargeisa used to have working traffic lights, but now the only traffic control is by the occasional police officer. All residents entitled to drive must hold a photo driving licence, and all cars bear Somaliland licence plates.\n\nTaxis can be booked via your hotel (not hailed on the street) but are quite expensive. For example, a taxi from Maan-soor Hotel to the airport cost USD $25 in April 2011.\n\nNote that women must wear long dresses or skirts, to the ankle (no trousers), and must cover their hair and upper arms at all times. Men should not wear shorts or armless t-shirts. It is not polite to take pictures of people (male or female) without obtaining their permission beforehand, and you will make people upset if you take pictures without permission.\n\nUS Dollars and Somaliland Shillings enjoy equal status in Hargeisa, so you can pay for anything with either Dollars, Shillings, or a combination of both. Ask what the ",{"type":"''","value":["de facto"]}," exchange rate is when you arrive (as of April 2011, it was 6,000 shillings to the Dollar). The ",{"type":"''","value":["de facto"]}," rate will be better than the rate at the airport.\n\nThere is no postal service in Hargeisa. The only courier company which serves the city is DHL.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See and Do"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Hargeisamosque.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["The Jama Mosque"]]},"\nThere's very little in the way of tourist sights and activities in Hargeisa.

While the main roads have some rudimentary paving, most roads are sand and dirt and populated by goats and stray dogs.\n\nThe local residents are extremely friendly and will greet foreigners in the street.
