It's a quaint little port town, which gained its fortune through fishing and trade. Still today, several commercial boating routes leave from here, on their way to Scandinavia or further. Some of the original fortifications have survived the test of time, as have the canals and a good number of historic warehouses and mansions.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThis is pretty much as north as it gets on the Dutch mainland. Harlingen started to grow in the 12th century, when the monks of a  nearby monastery dug canals to improve the trade activities in the area. Benefiting from the increased trade, Harlingen was awarded a city charter in 1234. For a few centuries however, the town remained of minor importance compared to nearby university city ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Franeker"]]},". As the harbour grew, however, so did Harlingen's wealth and fame.\n\nToday, most of the shipping is related to transport of salt from the local salt factory.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThis town is served by a good network of roads.

There are two train stations, ",{"type":"''","value":["Harlingen Haven"]}," (for the harbour) and ",{"type":"''","value":["Harlingen Station"]},". The train runs from here to Franeker, Dronrijp, Deinum and Leeuwarden, typically twice per hour but less on evenings or weekends.\n\nBuslines include lines 71 and 97 to Leeuwarden, line 75 to Franeker and 99 to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bolsward"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sneek"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Heerenveen"]]},".
