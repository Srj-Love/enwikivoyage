Old men meet on the park benches to woodcarve and shoot the breeze; young people flock to My Best Friends Closet to look for hip secondhand clothing.  You can have a fancy dinner at Bottini's, buy your medicine at the Alexander's drugstore (they live just above it!), and shop for anything from furniture to antiques to health food.\n\nThe 1929 Lyric Movie Theater on the downtown square was purchased in 1999 and renovated into a performance venue by the Ozarks Arts Council.  You can regularly catch classic movies, musical acts, musical theatre, and college activities and classes being held there.  You can rent it for your own special events as well (phenomenally cheaply).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nMany visitors and residents enjoy the Ozark Mountains and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Buffalo National River"]]}," nearby.
