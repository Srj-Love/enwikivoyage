Home to the famous Betty's tea rooms, Harlow Carr Gardens and Harrogate Spa Water. In addition to being a charming floral town Harrogate is a popular convention town (the center of town includes a large convention center). As a result it has many good restaurants and hotels and a pleasant, walkable center of town. Also, it can be difficult to get hotel reservations during the summer. Northwest of Harrogate is \"Herriott country\", the area where James Herriott lived and wrote the books All things Great and Small\/Bright and beautiful, etc. This remains a picturesque, relatively untouched area (unlike the nearby commercialized 'Lake District') that makes for several pleasant daylong drive.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Harrogate was voted as the 3rd and 4th 'Best Places to Live in the UK' in 2005 and 2006 respectively."]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["By plane"]},"\nThe closest airport is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Leeds-Bradford International Airport"]}," (LBA), offering direct flights daily across Europe, Africa and Asia.

The binge drinking culture is present but probably less pronounced than in most other towns of comparable size.\n\nOf course, as with any other town, caution is advised when alone, especially in low-lit areas and at night. The town has a very low crime rate, even in the suburbs, but it is advisable to be cautious at night if staying in the suburbs. It is also advisable to avoid visiting or passing through the Valley Gardens after dark due to the relatively high crime rate after dark in that area. Though very safe and very popular for families and tourists during the day, like any other town park, it has its share of riffraff late at night.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Visit nearby ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ripley Castle"]},", a 15th-century castle and stately home of the Ingilby family.
