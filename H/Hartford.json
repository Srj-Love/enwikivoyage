Crime is generally contained in the Northeast area of the city. Some people also report being victims of crimes after going to the Webster in the Frog Hollow area of the city. This can easily be avoided by not straying from the main road, especially at night. Most crime is gang related and the average citizen should not worry. Basically, if you are in the North end, stick to Albany Avenue (around the middle, as there is not much activity\/high crime near downtown), or use a car. This area is usually fine in the day as well, but the side streets are some of the worst in the city. The south end is generally fine, especially if you stick to Main Street, Park Street, Franklin Avenue, Maple Avenue, and Wethersfield Avenue. Side streets vary, especially in the Park\/Broad st areas (Frog Hollow), but these areas are conspicuous. The west end,downtown and Blue Hills are fine regardless of where you go.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Consulates"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Flag of Brazil.svg"],["20px"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Brazil"],["url=http:\/\/hartford.itamaraty.gov.br\/pt-br\/"],["email=cghartford@itamaraty.gov.br"],["address=One Constitution Plaza"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 860 760-3100"],["tollfree="],["fax=+1 860 760-3139"],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nHartford is a small city and one can access small farm towns in minutes.
