Jerusalem Ridge refers to the area just a few miles outside of Rosine and is best known as the birthplace and childhood home where the Monroe Family settled and lived in the early 1900s. The Jerusalem Ridge\/Monroe farm was almost 1000 acres in size and provided the Monroes with fertile farmland, logging and coal resources with sustained their humble existence. Young Bill was an especially hard and dedicated worker, a trait that he was always proud of and formed his dedicated work ethic and strong personality throughout his life. The Great Depression of the 1920s brought economic devestation and hardship to the region and the Monroe Brothers were forced to migrate north to seek work in the factories and refineries to help support the family back in Kentucky. Despite their best efforts, the family, facing increasing pressure to simply survive, were forced to leave their beloved family home on Jerusalem Ridge and the farm was foreclosed on and sold at public auction, a event that Bill and his brothers bitterly regretted for the remainder of their lives.
