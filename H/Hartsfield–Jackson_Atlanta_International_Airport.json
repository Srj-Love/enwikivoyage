In 2011, the airport also had 923,991 flights that departed and arrived. Its efficient layout means it is also easy to navigate and not as delay-prone as many other hub airports. The airport has many international nonstop services to North America, South America, Latin and Central America, Europe, Asia, and Africa.\n\nOn the domestic side, Hartsfield–Jackson is one large building separated into ",{"type":"'''","value":["South Terminal"]}," (Delta and its partners) and ",{"type":"'''","value":["North Terminal"]}," (all other airlines), connected by a central Atrium with a smattering of restaurants.

You can also enter your confirmation number or other booking details. If you're checking bags, indicate that on the kiosk, and it will direct you to a bag drop. The whole process is easy and takes just a minute or two; just answer the questions on the kiosk.\n\nMobile check-in is also available at all security checkpoints; this lets you pull up your boarding pass on your mobile phone to get through security and board the plane, bypassing the check-in desks and saving paper.\n\nThe other airlines have self check-in kiosks available, but they may not be as efficient.
