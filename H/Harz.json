The Harz forms part of the federal states of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lower Saxony"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saxony-Anhalt"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Thuringia"]]},". It lies between the river Elbe and Weser in the states of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lower Saxony"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saxony-Anhalt"]]}," and, to a small extent, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Thuringia"]]},". The range runs for 100km from northwest to southeast and is 30km wide. The terraced plateaus are made of limestone, sandstone, and slate and have been cut by many narrow, deep valleys. The two highest peaks in the area are the legendary and mysterious Brocken (1,141m  or 3,743 feet high), just higher than ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Snowdon"]]}," , and the Wurmberg  (971m  or 3,186 feet high),  both of which are made of granite. The higher, northwestern area is known as the Upper Harz (",{"type":"''","value":["Oberharz"]},") and the lower, southeastern area is the Lower Harz (",{"type":"''","value":["Unterharz"]},"). The highest mountains - around the Brocken are sometimes called the High Harz (",{"type":"''","value":["Hochharz"]},").\n\nThe Upper Harz plateau slopes from 1,000m elevation in the west down to 485m in the centre and suffers from a cold and damp climate, even in the summer, caused by its susceptibility to westerly winds. The Brocken rises above the plateau and is internationally famous for the stories and myths associated with it in local folklore and literature. The summit of the Brocken is bare and has an Alpine climate, but its lower slopes are forested and interspersed with moorlands and river beds. \n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Mapframe"],["51.68277"],["10.73364"],["zoom=9"],["layer=OD"]]},"\n\nThe Lower Harz has a gentler climate which has enabled it to be exploited by agriculture.  The area supports grain and cattle farming, and was once abundant with game, lynx, bear, and wolf. They were hunted to extinction, but there are projects to reintroduce some of these native animals again. The area is also famous for a number of rarer animal species, including the Harzer Roller canaries, bred for the mines.\n\nBetween the 10th-16th centuries, the area became immensely important for mining and metallurgy, lead, silver, iron, zinc, and copper being the main products. Easy access to water and wood helped the early settlers. Dams, however, have now been introduced to control the waters to remove the possibility of flooding or shortages in the summer. These dams generate hydroelectric power as well as drinking water for the area.\n\nIndustries such as quarrying (marble, granite, and gypsum) as well as wood processing for paper and cardboard provide sources of income.\nThe area is also heavily dependent on tourism with water sports and resorts being important, but it is its forest scenery in the Harz National Park which attracts the majority of the tourists.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Cities "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Altenau"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bad Harzburg"]]}," — charming spa town, ancient cable cars,  and a base for walks in the surrounding hills"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Blankenburg"]]}," — quaint former East German town and home to an imposing castle"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Braunlage"]]}," — the main ski resort and cable car to Lower Saxony's highest peak, the Wurmberg"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Clausthal-Zellerfeld"]]}," —  a resort in the Harz.

The Brocken was an East German and Soviet military surveillance post used to spy on military activity in Western Europe. From the East German side access to many villages was severely restricted. Roads and railway tracks were either closed or demolished, thus later facilitating the establishment of the Harz National Park. The division of the Harz by the Iron Curtain is still noticeable in the marketing of the Harz as a tourist destination with various sites on the old Inner German Border being preserved for historic and tourism reasons.\n\nTourism is the main source of income for the region. Unemployment is high, especially after the collapse of the industrial complexes in former East Germany. The number of tourists visiting a town is politically important. Goslar and surrounding villages compete against the cluster of Wernigerode, Quedlinburg, and Blankenburg and the Southern Harz regions in attracting tourists. This competition is not always friendly!\n\nRecommendations on where to go in the region may be coloured by a person's (East German or West German) origin.

Also, very high locations were required for its transmitters to transmit the very high frequencies required for TV to succeed. In 1934, the post office was given responsibility for building a mobile transmitter. 1935 saw the first public picture transmission. 1936 saw live transmissions of the Olympic games in Berlin. From 1936 to 1937 a 52m high television station and hotel with 16 floors was built. With the installation of the antenna system in 1938 the television station became operational. With the beginning of WWII, television transmissions stopped. Radio broadcasts on up to 40 transmitters carried on. In April 1945 an air raid by the Americans destroyed the hotel. The transmitter however was spared, to be used by the occupying forces. In 1947 allied troops pulled out toward the west. To justify the Americans having their part of Berlin, Saxony-Anhalt was handed to the Soviets. The Americans left in a state of chaos and the station was a gutted ruin. In 1948 the TV tower was shortened by around seven floors and a flat roof was added. 1973 to 1976 saw the new landmark 152m high metal end transmitter masts built to enable the transmission of the East German TV channel \"DDR 2\".

This area has been made accessible to the public with steps and railings. From here, one has a wonderful view of the Harz. The River Oker and Valley continues towards Goslar, coming next to Römkerhall, the smallest kingdom of the world ever proclaimed. This settlement consists of only a few houses and the hotel \"Kingdom of Romkerhall\", which resembles a fairy tale castle. The area was, in the second half of the 19th century, the hunting grounds of King George V of Hanover. Also here, is the Romkerhall Waterfall, approximately 64m in height. Upstream from the waterfall the River Oker is used occasionally by canoers. Downstream where the water flows faster, the crags left and right of the Oker are popular with climbers. Also downstream of the waterfall is \"Betrothal Island\" (",{"type":"''","value":["Verlobungsinsel"]},"), accessible via a small bridge. The River Oker finally arrives in the village of Oker on the outskirts of Goslar, leaving behind the beauty of the deep ravines and rocky outcrops.
