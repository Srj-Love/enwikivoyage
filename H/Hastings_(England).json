The town lent its name to the battle, although the battle actually took place in nearby ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Battle"]]}," (these were imaginative times...).\n\nThe town grew from its medieval origins into a Victorian seaside resort, and the majority of the towns architecture dates from this period. Today, along with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["St Leonards on Sea"]]},", Hastings forms a fairly large urban area on the south coast of around 100,000 inhabitants.\n\nNestled between the rugged beauty of the East and West Hills, the town's main attraction is the medieval Old Town, with its narrow passageways, antique shops, boutiques, cafe's and Europe's largest beach-launched fishing fleet. The town also boasts a hill-top castle, two funicular railways, the Georgian church of St Mary in the Castle, 18th century net shops, and access to Hastings Country Park - a 660 acre Nature Reserve with woodland glens, beaches and cliff top views. \nAway from the Old Town, Hastings largely retains the character of a Victorian seaside resort, with seafront squares, grand Victorian facades, elegant parks and a pier. However, the town suffered from the post war decline in the seaside tourist industry in England and while there has been significant recent investment in regenerating the area, parts of the seafront have seen better days.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Hastings old town passage.JPG‎"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Narrow passageways in old Hastings"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nHastings is at the end of the A21, which links the town to the M25 and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]},".
