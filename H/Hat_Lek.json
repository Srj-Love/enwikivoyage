[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Mena-asia_default_banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Hat Lek"]}," (also spelt Haad Lek, Had Lek, Hadlek, Hatlek) is the location of the southern-most border crossing between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Thailand"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cambodia"]]},". Its Cambodian counterpart is Cham Yeam, about 8 km from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Koh Kong"]]},".\n\nHat Lek is the name of the border. The only things here are a few shacks selling drinks and possibly a guesthouse.

",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chantaburi"]]},", a major hub, is a further 50 km (1 hour) from Trat. From Trat, minibuses to the border depart every 45 minutes between 06:00 and 18:00, taking between 1.5 and 2 hours, 120 baht. A cheaper and more breezy option involves songthaews (pickup trucks that act as local buses). First take one from Trat to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ban Khlong Yai"]]}," (80 baht); then catch another one the remaining 15 km to the border (20 baht).\n\nWatch out for overpriced transport scams at the border if entering from Cambodia. Transfers costing 1,400 baht have been forced upon some unfortunate travellers. If someone prevents you from taking either a minibus or songthaew, walk away. If they persist, head away from the immediate border area, head up the hill for about 150 m to the police checkpoint and then pick up a songthaew or minibus from there. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["From Bangkok"]},"\nBuses serving ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Trat"]]}," depart from either the Eastern Bus Terminal (Ekamai) or the Northern Bus Terminal (Mo Chit). Daytime direct 1st class buses from Ekamai (~240 baht) average a bit more than 5 hours, while the less frequent services from Mo Chit take a little less; late-night services are quicker still. While most 2nd class buses (188 baht, air-con) take a bit longer as they may make more stops and use slower and less direct routes. The midnight departure from Ekamai takes only 4.5 hours.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nHead across the border to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Koh Kong"]]},", 8 km away.
