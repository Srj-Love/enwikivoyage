This is why a lot of local do not consider themselves French but \"Savoyard\" or even \"Savoisiens\" (movement for independence from France, not followed widely) in their own right. The locals can be a bit tough to deal with and most regret the old days as this particular region went from very rural to over-flowing with inhabitants during the last 20 years (population tripled, house prices among the highest in France) but overall they are quite nice people.\n\nMany residents of the Haute-Savoie take pride in the culture and lifestyle that can be described as \"typiquement Savoyard\" (typical Savoyard, a variation of the word Savoie). Not only do many people believe it is one of the most beautiful parts of France, but there is also the cheese and other special dishes to dote on. Taking a chance to talk to the local people about the ways this area is different than the rest of France is sure to be enlightening and would greatly enrich the travel experience.  \n\nThe Haute-Savoie, particularly the rural areas, can also provide a revealing look at the quiet, small-town life in France.
