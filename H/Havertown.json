It is located in Delaware County, commonly referred to as \"Delco\"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nThe history of Havertown can be traced back to 40,000 acres of land being purchased by the Religious Society of Friends from William Penn in 1681. It is an area that has seen the transformation from farmland and water-powered mills to a unique suburban neighborhood. It was well known for both gunpowder and textile manufacturing, producing powder for the War of 1812 and the cloth for the Union army during the Civil War. Havertown is the home to several historical sites and is well known for being the birthplace of Swell Bubble Gum, whose factory still stands but closed down in 2004 (is currently being demolished). It is also known for its large Irish-American population, which is still evident today in the many Irish bars and stores throughout the town.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nHavertown is located very close to Philadelphia, about a half hour drive. Havertown is easily accessible to public transportation considering how close it is to 69th street Terminal. You can take either the SEPTA Rt. 104 bus or the Rt. 112 bus from 69th Street or you can take the Rt. 115 bus from Ardmore. It is also possible to take the Norristown High Speed Line (NHSL) into Havertown. If driving, you can reach Havertown off of Rt. 1 (City Line Avenue), Rt. 3 (West Chester Pike) or by taking I-95 to 476 (Blue Route) exit 9-Broomall\/Upper Darby. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nIt is easy to walk around Havertown, but the best way to get around is by car. Public Transportation is also an option but not the best. If you chose to drive, there is usually plenty of street parking, as well as, several parking lots near some of the stores. There are also many sidewalks which makes walking or biking an option.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Historic Grange Estate"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address=143 Myrtle Avenue"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +1 610-446-4958"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=A historic mansion built in the 1700s that was frequented by several Revolutionary War figures, such as, George Washington and General Lafayette.
