The island of Oahu, the most populous and home to the state capital and largest city of Honolulu, is great for people who wish to experience the islands and still keep the conveniences of a large city. Rainforests and hiking trails are located just minutes from Waikiki Beach, one of the world's best tourist destinations. In the winter, large waves on Oahu's north shore turn the normally sleepy area into the surfing capital of the world.\n\nOn the other hand, those who wish to experience Hawaii at a slower pace would do well to visit one of the Neighbor Islands (the other, less populated islands around Oahu). All the neighbor islands offer opportunities to relax and enjoy the sun and scenery. Many of the natural wonders of the Islands are located on the Neighbor Islands, from Waimea Canyon on Kauai, to Haleakala on Maui, to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the Big Island of Hawaii. Numerous waterfalls and rainforests evoke memories of what the islands might have looked like before major corporations set their sights on Hawaii.  The road to Hana is one of the most scenic on Maui, as you manipulate many turns overlooking the Eastern coast of the island.  It leads you over bridges and past beautiful waterfalls.  Ultimately, you can end up at the Oheo Gulch Pools (which are not sacred and there's more than seven), where the hiking is quite the experience.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["Father Damien"],["On 11 October 2009, ",{"type":"[[","value":[[":wikipedia:Father Damien"],["Father Damien de Veuster"]]}," (1840-1889), a Belgian priest who came to the island of Molokai in 1864 to treat victims of leprosy - and eventually succumbed to the disease - was canonized by Pope Benedict XVI."]]},"\n\nPolynesians migrated to, and established communities on, the islands of Hawaii before the arrival of Captain James Cook in 1778, who is widely credited as the first European visitor to the islands. At that time, each island was a separate kingdom. With the support of western advisors and weapons, Kamehameha I of the island of Hawaii conquered all the islands except Kauai, which acquiesced to his rule in 1810.\n\nAfter Kamehameha II abolished the ",{"type":"''","value":["kapu"]}," (taboo) system, American missionaries came to the islands to spread Christianity. As the ancient Hawaiians did not have any concept of owning land the missionaries became official land owners of many of the islands. Their children would later become successful businessmen in the Islands and still own entire islands to this day. Pineapple and sugar cane plantations were established, and workers from other countries (in particular Japan, the Philippines, China, and Korea) were imported as contract laborers. Later, their descendants would also become established as successful professionals.\n\nThe Hawaiian monarchy was overthrown in 1893 by a group of American businessmen. While the U.S. administration at the time refused to annex the former sovereign nation, in 1898 the United States did annex the islands, which became a territory in 1900, and a state of the United States in 1959.\n\nHawaii also became an important outpost for the U.S. military through the 20th century, and Pearl Harbor was the site of the Japanese attack on December 7, 1941, that resulted in the U.S. joining World War II.  Today, the military maintains its presence here, with several major military bases on the island of Oahu alone; Pearl Harbor remains the headquarters of the U.S. Pacific Fleet.  \n\nOver the years, many major retail chains have expanded their presence in Hawaii, making the Islands look more and more like the continental United States, often at the expense of local businesses. Nevertheless, Hawaii remains culturally vibrant. Its population, descended from the Native Hawaiians, the original plantation workers, and more recent arrivals, and in which no one group has a majority, is often cited as an example of multiculturalism at its best. There is a strong commitment to perpetuating native Hawaiian cultural traditions, as well as the cultural heritage of Hawaii's many immigrant communities from the Pacific, Asia and Europe. And certainly the environment is conducive to longevity... Hawaii has the longest predicted life expectancies of any U.S. state.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Weather"]},"\n\nDepending on where you're located in Hawaii, the weather can be very different over even short distances. On the same day, on Oahu you might find sun over the beaches in Waikiki and rain only a few miles away in Manoa Valley. \n\nAlthough the islands receive abundant amounts of both sunshine and rain, rain is more likely on the north and east sides of the islands, which face the prevailing northeasterly tradewinds (the \"windward\" side of the island), as well as the mountain peaks and valleys. The moist tropical air carried by the tradewinds is forced upward by the mountains, resulting in clouds and rain. Rain is less likely on the coastal areas of the \"leeward\" sides (the south and west sides) of the islands.\n\nAlthough there are no true \"seasons\" in the islands in the same sense as the rest of the U.S., the climate does go through annual cycles based on rainfall. The \"wet\" season in Hawaii (cooler temperatures and more rainfall) runs roughly from October to March, and the \"dry\" season (warmer temperatures and less rainfall) from April to September. There is therefore a higher probability of rain if you visit during the peak of tourist season in late December or January. \n\nHurricane season in the islands runs from June to November. Although Hawaii's relative isolation means that it is affected only rarely by tropical cyclones, a destructive storm will occasionally hit the Islands, such as Hurricanes Iwa and Iniki hitting Kauai in 1982 and 1992 respectively.\n\nOverall, Hawaii is warm and balmy — when you step out of the plane you'll immediately notice that the air is soft and humid — and during the summer months the tradewinds provide a pleasant breeze. Daytime temperatures generally range from the low 70s (21°C) in \"winter\" to the mid 80s (27°C) in \"summer\". Very rarely does the air temperature exceed 90°F (32°C) even in the hottest part of summer; however, the humidity will make it feel as if it were a few degrees hotter. Ocean temperatures range between 73°F (23°C) degrees in the winter to 78°F (25.5°C) in the summer. There is usually no more than a 20°F (12°C) difference between daytime high and nighttime low temperatures.\n\nConsequently, besides your driver's license, credit card, camera, binoculars, and other essentials, it's best to keep your clothes to a minimum...one or two pair of washable slacks\/shorts, light shirts, walking shoes, sandals and swim gear. A light jacket or sweater may be necessary depending on when and where you go, but heavy clothing is not normally necessary in most areas. Sunscreen is essential since Hawaii's close proximity to the Equator translates into very strong sun radiation. The suitcase space you save can be used to fill up on island purchases.\n\nAlthough the above is true for most of the Islands, you will find exceptions. A good rule to remember is the higher the elevation, the cooler it will be. Upcountry areas of Kauai, Maui and the Big Island will be cooler during the day, in the 60's, and much colder at night, in the 40's. At the highest elevations on Maui and the Big Island, temperatures can drop to near freezing in places like Haleakala National Park, Volcanoes National Park, and Mauna Kea. On the Big Island, both of the largest mountains, Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, can receive snowfall year around, mostly in the winter, and can even experience blizzard conditions. \n\nThere is more of a difference from the day-to-night temperatures in Hawaii than there is summer-to-winter. Given that, there can be more of a difference from lower elevations to higher elevations than either of those, depending on where you are visiting. It's important to research the areas you plan to visit and bring clothing suitable for those conditions.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Best times to go"]},"\nHawaii's tropical weather tends to be most attractive to tourists when the weather is frightfully cold at home. It's not surprising, then, that the peak tourist season in Hawaii is the Northern Hemisphere winter (mid-December to mid-April). The highest prices tend to be during the Christmas and New Year's season, with a second peak around spring break in March and April. Hawaii's weather is at its best (not too hot and not too cold, with not so much rain) in April, May, September, and October - ironically, this is also the period when some of the best deals can be had.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nForeign travelers entering Hawaii directly from another country are subject to the same entry requirements as for the United States in general. See the ",{"type":"''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["United States#Get in"],["Get in"]]}]}," section of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United States"]]}," article.\n\nAs Hawaii is one of the 50 United States, flights to Hawaii from the U.S. Mainland (that is, all of the U.S. outside of the state) are considered domestic flights. Therefore, it is not necessary for U.S. citizens or legal immigrants to show a passport (or any documentation of U.S. citizenship or immigration status) when entering Hawaii from the U.S. Mainland. It is also not necessary for foreign visitors to show passports or visas if they arrived on a flight from the mainland (i.e. if Honolulu was not their port of entry).\n\nWith that said, Hawaii does have some unique requirements that are intended more to control the flow of plants and animals than that of people. The islands have unique plant and animal life found nowhere else, and diseases and pests not found on the U.S. Mainland, and vice versa. Because of this, ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hawaii is an agricultural quarantine zone"]}," relative to the mainland.

Pets failing to meet these requirements will be subject to quarantine for up to 120 days. These requirements usually make it prohibitive for most short-term visitors to Hawaii to bring their pets.

Just remember that a month with strangers can be stressful so do what you can to be sure you have picked a good experienced crew and boat to sail with and be a good crewperson yourself.  Also ensure that any expectation in either direction of compensation including work duties, food, supplies, and damaged equipment is covered in writing so everything is clear between you and the boat owner.

By clicking on your country of origin when obtaining a quote from the car rental company's website, often an inclusive quote with loss damage waiver and supplemental liability insurance is provided. Otherwise using a travel agent website within your country e.g. your local Expedia website or local car hire broker will often also include insurance in their quote.\n\nGasoline, while nowhere near the prices charged in Europe, is significantly more expensive in Hawaii than on the Mainland. Expect to pay about 10% more than the prevailing rate on the Mainland for gasoline in Honolulu. Neighbor Island prices can be as much as 10-15% above that.\n\nBe aware that outside of the major highways (H1, H2 and H3) most locals refer to the roads not by number but by name, and will likely not understand if you ask for a road by number. For example, you would never hear someone refer to Kalanianiole Highway as \"route 72\" or \"highway 72.\"\n\nIf you ask for directions, they will likely not be given in terms of compass direction. Instead you will probably receive relative directions based on landmark. Common landmarks include ",{"type":"'''''","value":["mauka"]}," (toward the mountains), ",{"type":"'''''","value":["makai"]}," (toward the ocean), and on Oahu, ",{"type":"'''''","value":["ʻEwa"]}," (toward Ewa Beach, roughly west) and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Diamond Head"]}," (toward Diamond Head, roughly east). So a query for a grocery store might be met with \"go two blocks ",{"type":"''","value":["makai"]},", turn right on King and it's half a mile up on the ",{"type":"''","value":["mauka"]}," side of the street.\"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By moped\/scooter\/motorcycle"]},"\n\nScooters are also an excellent alternative to getting around the islands. Rental rates are fairly cheap: about $50\/day, or $135 for three days, which you can sometimes haggle down. The scooters are also fun to ride and are cheap on gas (typical mileage is 60–100 mpg, or 2.3–3.9 L\/100 km). You can ride them anywhere except on limited-access highways (of which there aren't many in Hawaii, and there's always a surface street that's probably more scenic).\n\nScooters only require a valid license for driving a car, not a motorcycle license. The driver must be over 15 (legally out-of-state license aren't acceptable unless the driver is 18, but this is rarely enforced). It's illegal for two or more persons to ride a moped, although this may not be enforced in more remote areas such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Big Island"]]},". Helmets are not mandatory, but if you want one (which is always a good idea) you should be able to rent one with your scooter, possibly for free. When you get your scooter, inspect it first, as some are in bad repair: make sure the headlights and turn signals are working, and insist on taking it for a quick spin around the block to check that the acceleration, transmission, brakes, and steering are okay. If anything is amiss, insist on a replacement scooter, or walk away from the deal and find another rental company.\n\nScooters that can go over 30 mph or have an engine larger than 49 cc are classified the same as motorcycles, so you need a ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.city-data.com\/forum\/hawaii\/947879-question-mopeds-scooters-vespas-etc.html#post13729771 motorcycle license"]},". Motorcycle rentals are easy to find. On most islands, you can also rent out Harley-Davidson motorcycles.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Bicycle"]},"\nDepending on where you travel a bicycle can be a great form of transportation if you keep a few things in mind.  Some roads are very narrow and winding which may create a hazard when sharing the road with cars.  There are also some steep hills as Hawaii is a series of mountains erupting from the sea; without a topo map an apparent shortcut may require a challenging hill while a long loop may be flat and avoid large terrain getting you there quicker.  If you stay near the beach there is the salty sea air and rain which will eventually rust a bicycle which is kept outside, keep on top of chain and part maintinence and cleaning to prevent damage.  Honolulu has a bicycle registration law requiring a fee tag, bicycles without can be impounded by police.  The law and common sense require a white front and red rear light when operating a bicycle during twilight and night.  Many airlines charge an oversized luggage fee for most full size bikes even when boxed, some tour capable folding bikes can be fit inside a standard suitcase, most public transportation doesn't allow bicycles at all.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Hawaiian"]]}]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["English"]}," are the official languages of Hawaii.

There are also many ethnic communities that speak languages such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chinese phrasebook"],["Mandarin"]]},", Cantonese, Tagalog, Ilocano, Vietnamese, Korean, Samoan and the native Hawaiian language.\n\nLearning a few words of Hawaiian can be fun and useful.

However, there are some subtle differences in word usage.  When talking with Hawaii residents, be aware of the following differences in word usage to avoid miscommunications. Also see ",{"type":"''","value":["Respect"]}," below.\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Always refer to the continental United States as \"the Mainland\" rather than \"the States.\""]}," For instance, say \"Back on the Mainland...\" instead of \"Back in the States...\" Hawaii has been one of \"the States\" since 1959, and the Hawaiian sovereignty movement notwithstanding (see Respect below), most Hawaii residents are proud to be part of the United States.  This is especially true for Japanese Americans, many of whose relatives served in the celebrated 100th\/442nd unit in World War II.  Using the term \"the States\" (implying that Hawaii is somehow foreign) may be seen as naive at best and condescending at worst. However, don't be surprised if some local people are condescending towards you because you are from the mainland. The \"local\" vs. \"mainland\" difference is something local people are only too happy to point out.

However, in Hawaii, the terms \"Hawaiian\" or \"native Hawaiian\" are reserved to mean someone who is descended from the aboriginal people of Hawaii.  This definition even appears in state laws. Because Hawaii is made of people of various ethnicities, someone whose family may have lived in Hawaii for generations may still not be Hawaiian by the above definition. To avoid misunderstanding, it is best to refer to Hawaii residents as such: Islanders, \"locals\", or ",{"type":"''","value":["kamaʻaina"]}," (as above), unless you know for a fact that they are of native Hawaiian descent."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\nAs in the rest of the United States, U.S. dollars are the local currency. There are plenty of banks, ATMs, and money change offices in all cities. However, none of the major American and foreign banks have branches in Hawaii, so the banking sector is served exclusively by small local banks. ATMs are scarcer on the North Shore of Oahu and other rural areas. Note that because Hawaii is an island state and transporting goods to Hawaii is more difficult, the prices for most goods are more expensive.\n\nHawaii has a 4% general excise tax statewide on the gross income of all businesses, which is generally passed on the consumer as a ",{"type":"''","value":["de facto"]}," 4.166% \"sales tax.\" As of 2007, the City and County of Honolulu adds an additional half-percent on the excise tax rate, making the \"sales tax\" rate on Oahu 4.712%.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Clothing"]},"\n\nOther than the stereotypical grass skirt (which is not generally worn in Hawaii except by hula dancers), no pieces of clothing are more associated with the Islands than the ",{"type":"'''","value":["aloha shirt"]}," and the ",{"type":"'''''","value":["muʻumuʻu"]},". \n\nThe ever-present aloha shirt comes in a wide variety of designs.

This kind of aloha shirt can be found in department stores.\n\nFor women, the ",{"type":"''","value":["muʻumuʻu"]}," is a long Hawaiian dress, usually made of cotton, that hangs loosely from the shoulder.\n\nA special note on shoes:  The lightweight sandal commonly referred to on the Mainland as a \"flip-flop\" or \"thong\" is known as a \"slipper\" or \"slippa\" in Hawaii.

Hiking and eco tours are popular on most islands, with opportunities for horseback riding, ATV, air tours, and other methods of exploring the landscape.  Museums and historical sites such as Pearl Harbor are also to be found throughout the islands.  Cultural activities such as the Polynesian Cultural Center on Oahu also make for interesting day-long activities.\n\nOahu is famous for Pearl Harbor tours, but also popular are ",{"type":"'''","value":["shark dives"]}," in cages, Waikiki snorkel tours as well as around Oahu Tours where you will see all the major highlights of Oahu including Diamond Head, the North Shore and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Dole Plantation"]}," where you can sample menu items made from fresh picked pineapples.\n\nMaui is the location for ",{"type":"'''","value":["humpback whale watching"]}," from December 15 to April 15 each year as the massive humpbacks migrate to Hawaii's warm waters to bear their calves.

In addition, jet skiing, parasailing and kayaking are available in tourist areas.\n\nSince many of the Islands tours and excursions are interacting with nature in some way, it's important to look in to each and make sure they are respecting the Islands. There are many endangered animals and plants, because of this there are many laws protecting them. A good example would be tour boats that have been fined for chasing dolphins or whales in order to please the tourists, while it's actually illegal and highly disrespectful.

All state parks are free to visit and even some National Parks. When the National Parks are not free, most find them very affordable. Hiking, beaches, snorkeling and other like activities are always free when on public land and there are no private beaches. On the Big Island there are many free ranger programs at Kaloko-Honokohau National Historical park and other locations. At the Visitor Information Station on Mauna Kea, you can stay any night of the year between 6pm and 10pm and enjoy a free astronomy tour including large and small telescopes for you to look through.

Currently, police officer applicants do not have to be residents.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nContemporary food in Hawaii, like the language and popular culture, is a medley of traditional Hawaiian, Portuguese, American, and Asia-Pacific flavors.

Another favorite is the breakfast platter at Hawaiian McD's features Portuguese sausage, Spam, eggs, and steamed rice, sometimes with fresh pineapple.\n\nPerhaps the best setting for tourists to enjoy traditional Hawaiian food is at a ",{"type":"'''","value":["luau"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["lū‘au"]},"), a traditional Hawaiian feast. Tourists can find luaus at various locations in the Islands, including many of the major resort hotels. At a modern luau traditional Hawaiian favorites are served buffet style, and there is also Hawaiian music, hula, and other Polynesian entertainment.

For specific places at which to eat, see the individual island or city articles. Be sure to check the coupon books that are available at display stands for meal specials.\n\nPopular local snacks are also heavily influenced by the large mix of cultures present in Hawaii, primarily the Chinese and Japanese. Since many of these snacks are unique to Hawaii and cannot be found anywhere else, consider purchasing a few bags from any grocery store to bring on your travels.

If you are camping on a beach, keep bags locked in a car (but don't assume that they are safe in the trunk, especially if you are driving a rental) and keep valuables in a hidden money belt. Although Hawaii is generally considered relatively safe, it does have some violent crime. Consequently, women should not walk alone in unlit areas. Although Honolulu has one of the lowest violent crime rates of metro areas in the U.S., use your common sense.  Stay smart and act as if you were in your own home city: lock doors, lock cars, and don't leave valuables lying around.  Some campgrounds now require a permit (this has the effect of moving homeless people away from tourist areas). Be sure to apply for a reserved area and have your permit even in free camping areas especially around Honolulu.\n\nAny of the beaches are vulnerable to pickpockets and thieves who break into cars. If you are using a rental car, it is advised you buy a bumper sticker or two to make it seem like you are a local. Paradoxically, keeping the car windows open will prevent break-ins and car damage, as the locals will think there is nothing of worth in the car. As a rule of thumb, do not bring anything to the beach you do not plan on using. If you must bring money, bring a friend to keep it safe.\n\nIf you are planning a hike in the mountains, monitor local weather reports carefully and use extreme caution in case of rain.

Do not swim in freshwater pools if you have open sores; see a doctor if you develop flu-like symptoms after hiking or swimming. If you do not have open sores and swim in these areas, the best way to avoid Leptospirosis or any bacteria is to never drink any natural water, no matter how clean it looks. If you are backpacking and this is a must, remember to bring the needed water filters and\/or iodine pills to treat your water. \n\nBe sure to have travel ",{"type":"'''","value":["health insurance"]},".  If you are a U.S. resident with private health insurance, you should consult your insurance carrier to determine what co-payments apply and to what extent your insurance is accepted in Hawaii by doctors and hospitals in the event you need health care while on your trip. However, if you get a job in Hawaii - even a part-time job - you will receive health insurance by state law (presuming that you are a U.S. citizen or have a green card and are therefore legally eligible to work).

Vog is formed when sulfur dioxide gas from Kilauea mixes with sunlight, water, and dust particles to form a haze made up primarily of sulfur compounds. Normally the northeasterly trade winds blow vog away from the rest of the islands. Southeasterly winds (also known as Kona winds in Hawaii), however, can blow vog toward the other islands. Vog can be a nearly constant presence on the Big Island. While many people in Hawaii can experience symptoms related to vog, it can especially affect those with asthma or other chronic respiratory illness. If you have a respiratory condition and plan to visit the Big Island, consult your doctor for advice.\n\nWhen going to the beach\/swimming always wear ",{"type":"'''","value":["sunscreen lotion or sun guard"]}," to protect your skin from burns, as well as hats, covers and sunglasses.

Research the locations you plan to visit and dress accordingly, as some areas like Volcanoes National Park or Mauna Kea on the Big Island, or Haleakala National Park on Maui will leave you miserable in shorts and tank tops, as they may have below freezing weather, drenching rain and even snow. \n\nFor the beach or pool, boardshorts or swimming trunks for men are the most popular, though with so many visitors from Asia, speedos are welcome too.

If you do wear an aloha shirt for business, wear it like you would any other button-up shirt for business: tuck it in, button all but the top button, and wear an undershirt if that's your style.\n\nThe business aloha shirt extends also to dressing up for fine dining, entertainment, and even church; some preachers wear business aloha shirts for church services. As a visitor, just put on a collared shirt, shoes (such as casual loafers), and, depending on the restaurant you're going to, either shorts or slacks.

There is currently no consensus among Native Hawaiians on what form this sovereignty should take, with some preferring the status quo of ordinary citizenship, some seeking a status similar to that of Native Americans, and some wanting complete independence and secession from the Union. In addition, private and government programs that benefit Native Hawaiians have been called into question via a series of lawsuits that have received extensive coverage in local media.  Discussions of Hawaiian sovereignty and programs can arouse a variety of strong opinions (both in support and in opposition) among Hawaii residents of all ethnicities, and the uninitiated visitor would be wise to avoid bringing up these topics in casual conversation.
