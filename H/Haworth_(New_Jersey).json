With roots dating back to the Pre-Revolutionary War period, Haworth began as a farming community, but over time developed into a residential suburb within easy commuting distance of New York City.\n\nToday Haworth covers an area of 2.2 square miles, and is home to approximately 3,390 residents. Haworth residents enjoy many benefits of suburban living – excellent schools, a thriving small town commercial center, two excellent golf courses, beautiful parks and recreational facilities.\n\nIt’s a quiet town, full of small-town atmosphere and tree-lined beauty, which belies the fact that it’s close enough to New York City to be a suburb. The town boasts an excellent local school, Haworth Public School, with grades kindergarten through 8th . For high school, students attend the equally top-notch Northern Valley Regional High School at Demarest.
