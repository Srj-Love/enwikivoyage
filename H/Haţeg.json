After her father had fallen in the battle of Viisoara that had taken place in 1530, the princess took refuge in the province of Transylvania, where she settled down and got married.

Over the succeeding centuries it was renovated many times.\nAlthough the monastery has been a focus for the spiritual life of the Romanians beyond the Carpathian Mountains and had a great historical significance, it was closed down as a result of the Governmental Ordinance no 410\/1959, issued on the orders of the communist authorities.\nIn 1973, a monk settles on the premises and tried to revive the monastic life of this place. In 1976, through the persevering efforts of the ever-memorable Father Arsenie Boca and of Mother Zamfira Constantinescu, the holy establishment was reopened and served as a convent.After 1990, conservation, consolidation and restoration activities have been carried out within the monastery. A theological school for training both young female resident monastic and lay young women has also been accommodated in the monastery.\nIn June 1992, the Holy Synod of the Romanian Orthodox Church decided to canonize Venerable Ioan of Prislop, who was one of the most outstanding representatives of the Romanian monasticism at the end of the 14th century.\nAntonie Plamadeala, Metropolitan of Ardeal, took religious vows and entered the monastic life in this very monastery.\nThe holy establishment also shelters a monastic theological seminary."]]}]},{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Biserica din Densus.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Densus Church"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=St. Nicholas Church, Densuș"],["alt=Biserica Sf.

The metropolis had some strategical and economical advantages. Retezat Mountains at the South and Poiana Ruscai Mountains at the North were natural barriers difficult to cross for the eventual invaders. The capital, who's territory territorium was from Tibiscum to Micia till the entrance in the Jiu pass, was developing in peace, defended by the Roman camps Tibiscum (today Jupa), Voislova, Micia (Vetel) and Bumbesti.\nBy Ulpia Traian was crossing the imperial road from Danube and marked the link between the North of the province to Porolissum (Moigrad).The antic city had an area of 32 ha surrounded by walls.

But the city was not only inside the walls. Outside the walls, on a great area, were the village, the craftsmen workshops (brick makers, glass blowers), the temples and other public or private buildins. Also outside the walls were the cemeteries of the city (sepulcreta) identified at East and also at the West.
