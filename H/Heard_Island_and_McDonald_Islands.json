The McDonald Islands are small, rocky and actively volcanic. The islands are populated by large numbers of seal and bird species, and have been designated a nature reserve.  There are 4 types of penguins that are located on Heard Island\n\nWith the only two active volcanoes in Australian territory the islands are situated on the Kerguelen Plateau.\n\nThe islands are really really remote - they are located  4,099 km (2,547 mi) south west of Perth, in Western Australia, 3,845 km (2,389 mi) south west of Cape Leeuwin, in Western Australia, and 4,200 km (2,600 mi) south east of South Africa, as well as being 1,630 km (1,010 mi) north of Antarctica.\n\nCaptain John Heard, sighted Heard Island on 25 November 1853, on a journey from Boston to Melbourne.  Captain William McDonald of the Samarang found McDonald Islands on 4 January 1854.\n\nBetween 1855 to 1880  American sealers inhabited the island, living in appalling conditions. The island housed 200 people at one stage. By 1880 the sealers had eliminated the seal population and then moved on. 100,000 barrels of elephant-seal oil had been produced at this time.\n\nThe islands have been part of Australia since 1947. The archipelago became a World Heritage Site in 1997.\n\nAmateur radio DXpeditions to the island took place in January 1997 and in January 1983.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nVisiting these islands will require careful planning and preparation as there are no permanent human inhabitants. Access will require either mounting or joining an expedition. Because of the islands' status as a nature reserve, permission to land from the Australian Antarctic Division will be necessary; landings can only be made on the McDonald Islands for \"compelling scientific reasons\".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\nThere is no economic activity on Heard or the McDonald Islands.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nThere are two structures on the island, a ruined sealers hut near Oil Barrel Point, and an apple hut of unknown condition at the northern end of Atlas Cove.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay Safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Islands of the Southern Ocean"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Geo"],["-53.1"],["73"],["zoom=10"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Heard Island and McDonald Islands"]]}]
