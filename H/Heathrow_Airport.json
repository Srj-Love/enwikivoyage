Originally established in the late 1940s, it is London's primary airport, the premier air gateway into the United Kingdom, and is the busiest airport in the world for international passenger traffic and is Europe's foremost hub airport.\n\nDue to its size, increased security requirements and the fact that development had not kept pace with its growth, Heathrow became overcrowded and developed a reputation for long queues, inefficiency and delays. However, since Terminal 5 opened in March 2008, and despite initial problems with the brand new terminal, this situation has improved.  Terminal 2, the airport's original terminal, closed in November 2009 for demolition and rebuilding  and is expected to reopen in 2014.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Flights"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Heathrow Airport Destinations.svg"],["center"],["802px"],["thumb"],["Countries served by flights from London Heathrow Airport (includes seasonal and future destinations)."]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Terminal changes"]},"\nThere is currently a long, drawn out game of musical terminals being played by the airlines at Heathrow: British Airways is gradually moving all of its flights to Terminals 5 and 3. While British Airways is doing this the other airlines are moving round to better use the space that has been vacated.  Eventually the idea is that all of the airline alliances (Oneworld, Star Alliance and SkyTeam) will have their 'own' terminal which their members use, thus minimizing the number of connecting passengers who have to change to a different terminal. Terminal 2, the oldest and smallest terminal has now closed to be replaced by a brand new building which will also eventually replace T1. Because of this it is currently imperative to double-check where your flight departs from — for example, at the time of writing, British Airways operates from T3 and T5.

(27 km) west of central London. A large part of the journey can be made by means of the M4 motorway, which can, however, be quite congested at peak periods. Terminal 5 can be reached directly from the M25.  The airport is also near the M40 and M3.\n\nThe car rental depots are all concentrated along the northern periphery of the airport, and free shuttle buses are available from all terminals.  There can be time delays when arriving at the hire desk with large queues so make every effort to get to the desk before the crowd, perhaps by getting one member of the party with hand luggage to go straight through. You may find at early morning or late evening that the arrivals hall desk is closed and you have to go straight onto the shuttle bus and check out your rental at the depot instead.\n\nBear in mind if you are intending to drive into the centre of London - you will be liable for the Congestion Charge - which is currently £8 per day and applies on weekdays between 7am-6pm.  Automatic number plate recognition cameras are in operation, and your car rental company will track you down and bill you with the £30 fine if you fail to pay - you have been warned!\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Parking your car"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Different car parks have different procedures."]},"\nThere is no shortage of choice when parking your car at Heathrow but there are many procedures to follow depending on which car park you choose. Some simply get you to turn up and report to a reception area which is easy enough. However some others have different procedures such as using the credit card you used to pre book with to enter the car park or even registration plate recognition.\n\nThere is also a massive difference in the prices charged by many car parks in and around Heathrow. For example, you can find individual house owners in the vicinity of Heathrow Airport who are happy to rent you a space outside their house for a week or two and it’s usually very cheap in comparison to the large car park operators; however, this is definitely a case of ‘buyer beware’!\n\nOf course, there is no security at these spaces – you get what you pay for to some extent – plus you often find that you are left to your own devices to get to the airport. This could mean public transport if you’re lucky, but more often than not, it means getting a taxi both there and back. This usually results in negating any of the cost savings you have made in the parking itself.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Public transport to and from London"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Heathrow rail links.png"],["thumb"],["220px"],["Rail and tube lines go to different terminals at Heathrow"]]},"\nAll the terminals have very good public transport links to and from Central London, with options ranging from local and express busses to the London Underground and rail services.

The Heathrow Express does not operate directly to Terminal 4; you must take a connecting (Heathrow Connect) train to Terminals 1 & 3 and change - cross platform - to the Express.\n\nThe train departs from Terminal 5 every 15 minutes, stops at Terminals 1 & 3 and then runs non-stop to London Paddington, Central London, where connections are available to the rest of London’s transport system. Journey time from Terminal 5 to London Paddington is 21 minutes, and from Terminals 1 & 3 it’s 15 minutes. The first train from Heathrow leaves at 05:42 and the last at 23:42.\n\nThe trains are air-conditioned, modern, comfortable and are fully accessible with a wheelchair area, disabled toilet and level access to the station platforms.  Free Wi-Fi Internet access is available on board. Mobile phone coverage is available throughout the entire route, including in the tunnels under Heathrow. On board TV entertainment plays throughout the journey, offering BBC News bulletins, destination information, comedy clips and trivia. Quiet zones are available where this does not play. There are two classes of accommodation - Express (Standard) Class and First Class. First Class offers a larger seat, more legroom (though there’s plenty in Express Class), tables and complimentary newspapers. The First Class area of the train also stops closer to the station exits.\n\nFares can be purchased in advance on the Internet, from the station or on board the train and they vary in price depending on where you bought them. An Express Class Adult Single bought online costs £16.50, or £18.00 at the station (£32 Return, online or at station), with a £3 surcharge over the at-station price if you buy on-board (per March 2010). National Railcard discounts are available at Heathrow Express station ticket offices only (with the exception of Disabled Persons Railcard, which can be used on-board). Child fares (5–15 years inclusive) are about half the adult fare. Under 5s travel free. If you book your ticket online you can have it sent to you as an email message to print out or as a mobile phone picture message, both contain a barcode and the conductor scans this on the train.\n\nLondon Travelcards and Oyster Cards are not valid on the Heathrow Express.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Heathrow Connect"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Direct from Terminals 1, 3 & 4, and via a connection from T5.

Journey time from Terminal 4 to London Paddington is 33min and 28min from Terminals 1 & 3.

Audio and visual journey information is provided on board. Mobile phone coverage is available throughout the route, including in the tunnels under Heathrow.\n\nFares must be purchased before boarding the train (tickets will be checked on board and those found not to be holding a ticket will have to pay a penalty fare) and can be bought at station ticket offices. A Heathrow to London Paddington Adult Single costs £8.50 (£16.50 Open Return). Child fares (5–15 years inclusive) are about half the adult fare.

Depending on the route, some trains take 30 minutes (trains via Richmond), others take 45 minutes (trains via Hounslow and Kew), so it is advised to check the train times carefully if you are rushing to catch a plane. You must buy your train ticket before boarding as this is not an airport express train but a standard suburban rail service.

Oyster cards are valid."]},"\nThe Piccadilly Line runs direct from all the terminals to the very centre of London, stopping at stations close to many of London’s landmarks, shopping and entertainment areas, as well as the major transport hub at King’s Cross St. Pancras. It stops frequently and is comparatively slow (60 minutes from Terminal 5 to King’s Cross St. Pancras vs 45 minutes using the Heathrow Express and changing to The Tube at Paddington). However, it is an integral part of Transport for London’s network so Travelcards and Oyster Cards are valid, making it a good value option. It’s also a fairly quick option if you want to get to much of West London.\n\nTrains depart Terminals 4 & 5 every 10 minutes and stop at Terminals 1 & 3 before continuing to London, thus making the frequency from Terminals 1 & 3 every 5 minutes. Trains to & from Terminal 5 do not stop at T4 and trains to & from T4 do not stop at T5. Be aware that if you are heading from Central London to Terminals 1 & 3 then it is normally quicker to wait for a train which terminates at T5 as the trains to T4 wait there for up to 7 minutes before continuing to Terminals 1 & 3. T5 trains go directly to Terminals 1 & 3 first, then continue to T5. The Tube closes during the night and first trains leave Heathrow at about 6AM, last trains are about midnight.\n\nBe aware that during peak rush hour periods the Tube becomes extremely overcrowded - particularly in the central zones.  Trains originally designated for Heathrow are sometimes rerouted down the Rayners Lane branch or terminate short at Acton Town or Northfields to deal with peak-hour congestion - the driver will normally make an announcement if this is going to happen.  Therefore if you are using the Tube to travel to Heathrow during rush hour - bear this in mind and leave Central London in plenty of time.  Also, try to join the train as far up the line as possible - King's Cross St Pancras is a good bet - since you will stand a much better chance of finding a seat and somewhere to put your luggage.\n\nAs The Tube is a rapid transport system designed with short journeys in mind, the trains are not the most comfortable. However, from Heathrow there will almost always be seats available and luggage space is provided. There is space for wheelchairs and the Heathrow stations are accessible, but as The Tube is an old system originally built in the 19th century, very few stations in Central London are accessible to wheelchairs. Almost all involve negotiating staircases and escalators. Earls Court is an exception and some other stations can be reached by wheelchair users by changing to alternate lines here. More stations are being adapted (King’s Cross St. Pancras is now accessible, for instance) and accessible stations are shown on the Tube Map available on TfL’s website ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.tfl.gov.uk\/"]},". Audio and visual journey information is provided on board.\n\nThe Tube is a closed system and nearly all stations have ticket barriers. Tickets should be bought at the station and the cost of a Zone 1 - 6 (Central London - Heathrow) single is £4.50. Penalty fares are in force for those caught without a valid ticket. Travelcards (day, or period tickets which allow unlimited travel on all of London’s public transport, not just The Tube) are available and will almost certainly provide better value if you plan on using London’s transport system more than a couple of times. The cheapest option for anyone spending much time in London will probably be to get an Oyster Card (a Transport for London travel smart-card), which is always cheaper than paying fares in cash.

Make sure you specify the method you want to use to reach Heathrow when you buy your rail ticket.\n\nIf you plan on travelling on the Great Western line to the South West of England or Southern Wales then another option is to take the local U3 bus from the Central Bus Station to West Drayton railway station. The bus takes around 20 minutes to complete this journey when there is no traffic. From there take a local train to Reading railway station in order to connect to other services.
