A simple wooden diner style restaurant overlooking the Kankakee River, with an outdoor dining deck, and an equally woodsy bar attached. They offer up a huge menu, including great fried chicken, gardenburgers, and a salad that comes in a big fried or baked bowl - that you can eat. Quite fascinating. They have two great homemade salad dressings - river garlic and river mexican, that they sell in jars. Their dinner portions are huge, but they also offer smaller half portion options too - frog legs on the side too. A great experience."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=US 231.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["directionl1=N"],["majorl1=Ends at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Schererville"],["N"]]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:US 41.svg"],["18px"]]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kentland"],["S"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Crown Point (Indiana)"],["Crown Point"]]}],["directionr1=S"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lafayette (Indiana)"],["Lafayette"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rensselaer (Indiana)"],["Rensselaer"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["41.321667"],["-87.201667"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Northwestern Indiana"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Hebron, Indiana"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North_America\/United_States\/Indiana\/Localities\/H\/Hebron\/"]]}]
