It was established around 1550 at the crossing point of two water ways.

They run once per hour each, providing a connection between the major destinations every half hour. It's about 20 minutes from Heerenveen to Leeuwarden or 40 minutes from Heerenveen to Zwolle. If you're on the train that stops more often, your travelling time is only a few minutes longer, so don't bother waiting for the other one. The sports stadium has its own stop, but is only served by the stop train.\n\nThe bus station is next to the train station, and buses run to and from most regional destinations. There are Qliner services to some further destinations, including ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Groningen"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lelystad"]]},".\n\nHeerenveen is easily reachable by bike, with many roads leading into town. If you have a boat, you can also get to the city over water. The main waterways are the Heeresloot, the Engelenvaart and the Nieuwe Heerenveense Kanaal.
