Heidelberg is located in the Neckar river valley right where the legend-rich ",{"type":"'''","value":["Odenwald"]}," (Forest of Odes or Odin) opens up towards the plains of the Rhine Valley.  Heidelberg is home to the oldest university in Germany (est. 1386). With 28,000 students, the Ruprecht-Karls-Universität (or ",{"type":"''","value":["Ruperto Carola"]},", the Latin equivalent of its name) is one of Germany's larger academic institutions and boasts the full spectrum of an ancient academy, from Egyptian Studies to Computer Linguistics. The faculties for Medicine, Law and Natural Sciences are considered to be among the best in Germany. The university fostered the establishment of several other world class research institutions such as the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), the European Molecular Biological Laboratory (EMBL), Center for Molecular Biology (ZMBH), Max Planck Institutes for Medicine, Astronomy, Nuclear Physics, among others. Generally speaking, Heidelberg is an academic city with a long and rich history and is similar in many ways to cities such as Cambridge or Oxford (Heidelberg and Cambridge, England are twinned).\n\nDuring WWII, the city was almost completely spared allied bombings which destroyed many of Germany's larger inner cities. As a result, Heidelberg has retained its baroque charm of narrow streets, picturesque houses and of course the world-famous Schloss (castle ruins). After World War II, the US Army built large barracks at the southern end of the city. Heidelberg's 149,600 inhabitants thus include not only 28,000 students at the university but also nearly 20,000 US citizens, almost all of them soldiers and their families. With hundreds of thousands of tourists flocking to the city annually, Heidelberg is truly a culturally diverse and international destination, despite its small size.\n\nOver the years, Heidelberg has attracted numerous artists, intellectuals and academics from all over Europe and has sometimes been referred to as Germany's unofficial intellectual capital. People who have lived and worked in the city include the poets Joseph von Eichendorff, Jean Paul and Goethe, scientists such as Bunsen and Kirchhoff, philosophers such as the founder of the \"Illuminati\" order von-Knigge, atheist Ludwig Feuerbach, existentialist Karl Jaspers, political theorist Hannah Arendt, architect Albert Speer, and many more. Mark Twain wrote in ",{"type":"''","value":["A Tramp Abroad"]},":\n\n:...Out of a billowy upheaval of vivid green foliage ...rises the huge ruin of Heidelberg Castle, with empty window arches, ivy-mailed battlements, moldering towers—the Lear of inanimate nature—deserted, discrowned, beaten by the storms, but royal still, and beautiful.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Frankfurt Airport"]]}]}," - The nearest intercontinental airport."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Stuttgart"]]}]}," - for European 'EU-domestic' flights."]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["ICE Train from Frankfurt or Stuttgart Airport to Heidelberg"]},"\nYou can travel to Heidelberg via ICE (Inter City Express), Germany's fastest train, running at 300 km\/h (180 mph) ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.bahn.de\/i\/view\/USA\/en\/index.shtml"]},".\n\nBoth Frankfurt and Stuttgart airports have train stations inside the terminal.
