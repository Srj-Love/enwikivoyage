[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"],["pgname=Hell"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.hell2u.com\/ Hell"]}]}," is a small unincorporated community of 266 people (as of 2000) in Livingston County, in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southeast Michigan"]]},", best known for... well, for its name.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThe area was first settled in 1838 by George Reeves, who owned a mill and general store. No-one is quite sure how the community got its name; one theory is that a pair of German travellers, upon disembarking in the hilly area, amused the locals by proclaiming it to be \"",{"type":"''","value":["So schön und hell"]},"\", meaning ",{"type":"''","value":["so bright and beautiful"]},". Another is that the swampy area was a good breeding ground for mosquitoes, and the traders canoeing through the area had a few choice words for their attackers. The third, and most widely believed, is that when the local officials asked what his settlement should be called, Reeves (possibly having overheard those German visitors) replied, \"I don't care, you can name it Hell if you want to.\" Evidently, the name stuck.\n\nDespite its small size — the \"main drag\" of Hell is all of three buildings — the community has become a popular tourist destination for its irreverent name alone. The local businesses are given amusingly devilish titles, painted with licking flames, and stocked with gruesome and kitschy souvenirs of the sort you usually only see around Halloween. Every so often you'll hear of a nationwide promotional contest in which the prize is \"a trip to Hell\". One popular photograph depicts a wintertime town sign draped in icicles (\"when Hell freezes over\", which is also \"a cold day in Hell\"), and of course the community was kept massively busy on June 6, 2006, when most items were sold for $6.66. Hell was also the inspiration for a comic book entitled ",{"type":"''","value":["Hell, Michigan"]}," — created by Tilman Goins from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Morristown (Tennessee)"],["Morristown"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tennessee"]]}," — which chronicles the fictional residents' attempts to fight the demonic evil of their town.\n\nAside from its fire-and-brimstone appeal, Hell is situated in the middle of the lovely Pinckney State Recreation Area. A short drive away from the village will bring you to lakes, rivers and forests for hiking, horseback riding, swimming, canoeing, kayaking and fishing.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nHell is situated on two-lane county road D-32 (Patterson Lake Road), about 5 minutes southwest of Pinckney; despite the saying, the road is paved with asphalt.
