The food on these cruises is usually adequate, but a bit plain, but the experience is not about culinary delights. If you still have energy after the cruise, hit the bars and the night clubs. See the main ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Helsinki"]]}," article for hints.

After visiting the church, walk to the ",{"type":"'''","value":["National Museum"]},", located between Museokatu and Mannerheimintie. The walk is short, but the small streets in the area form a small labyrinth, so it is best to navigate by carefully checking a map at each street corner instead for following any spesific instructions. The museum takes one hour for those wishing to just walk through it while getting a brief glimpse of Finnish history. Those with a passion for the subject should reserve up to five hours. Afterwards you might want to see the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Töölöönlahti Park"]},", located across the street.\n\nThere are restaurants and bars dotted around the labyrinth of streets surrounding the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Church in the Rock"]}," and the ",{"type":"'''","value":["National Museum"]},".

Take any tram going north from in front of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["National Museum"]},". After a brief tram ride to the Opera House tram stop you should change to tram 3T and take it to the Alppila tram stop, close to the main entrance of the amusement park. There are restaurants and snack bars in the amusement park.\n\nIf art is your thing, you should try either ",{"type":"'''","value":["Kiasma"]},", the museum of contemporary art, or ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ateneum"]},", which concentrates on classical art. Both museums are located near the Central Railway Station. Visiting both museums during one afternoon is feasible for people who do not want to stop and admire each piece of art. Restaurants and cafés are plentiful in the area.\n\nFor a well-balanced portion of nature, history and beautiful views, you should visit the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Suomenlinna fortress"]},". Go to the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Market Square"]}," (Kauppatori) to find the ferry to islands. Any ticket valid in the Helsinki public transport is also valid for the ferry. You should take a map of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Suomenlinna"]}," from the ticket booth. The islands have restaurants and cafés, and picnic is also a good option.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Evening "]},"\n\nHelsinki has a selection of interesting restaurants to suit all tastest and budgets. For the evening, consider one of the following options.\n\nRestaurant ",{"type":"'''","value":["Salve"]}," is well over one hundred years old. It used to be a watering hole for sailors, and retains some of that atmosphere even today. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Salve"]}," is famous for its simple, but delicious dish of fried baltic herrings. Salve is located at Hietalahdenranta 11, and is best reached by tram number 6 going to Hietalahti direction. You can expect to pay around 18 euros for the baltic herrings and a beer.\n\nFor a mid-price option, reserve a table at the restaurant ",{"type":"'''","value":["Juuri"]},". The restaurant specialises in traditional Finnish ingredients and fresh produce from local producers. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Juuri"]}," is located at Korkeavuorenkatu 27, and can be reached by walking or by the tram number 10. You can except to pay around 50 euros per person for a three course meal and a glass of wine.\n\nIf you are not restricted by the budget, you should definitely dine at the internationally acclaimed restaurant ",{"type":"'''","value":["Chez Dominique"]},", where you will find brilliant, highly elaborate French-style cuisine with a Nordic twist. The restaurant is located at Rikhardinkatu 4, and is best reached on foot or by taxi. Expect to pay between 200 and 500 euros per person.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Longer visits "]},"\n\nThe two day itinerary above is a good starting point for a longer visit. You can compose an itinerary for a longer visit from the options given below.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Archipelago excursion (full day) "]},"\n\nThis itinerary will take you away from Helsinki and the capital region.\n\nThe unique ",{"type":"'''","value":["Archipelago Sea"]}," on the southwestern coast of Finland has the largest number of islands of any archipelago, at least if even the smallest skerries are counted. To visit the archipelago while based in Helsinki, you should rent a car. Note that just driving there and back takes 6-10 hours, depending on the traffic and how far you wish to go. Driving it self will be enjoyable, however, because of the scenery and cable ferry connections between the islands. It is therefore best to leave really early in the morning and return late in the evening, spending 12-16 hours on the excursion. Archipelago is not really a winter destination.\n\nOne timing option is to first drive without stopping to the island group of Houtskari at the end of the road, or until you have spent a third of your time, whichever happens first. After that you should return to Helsinki along the same route, but this time making stops and detours.\n\nFor more relaxed pace, you might want to spend on night in the archipelago. It is also convenient to combine this excursion with a visit to the nearby city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Turku"]]},", in which case you should spend 1-3 nights in the area.\n\nFor the trip you will need a detailed map, or a GPS navigator, or preferably both. For the best maps, you should buy the map book called \"GT Tiekartasto\" from any big book store, such as the \"Akateeminen kirjakauppa\" at the corner of Keskuskatu and Pohjoisesplanadi. The maps in this book are accurate, precise and informative. However, the book covers the entire country, and you may end up paying for maps that you really don't need.\n\nFrom Helsinki, take the highway number 1 towards west and the city of Turku. The intersections on the highway are numbered, and you should turn to road number 180 at the intersection 6. It will take 1.5-2.5 hours to reach this point, depending on how fast you can get out of the capital region. The road 180 is essentially the same road that will take you to farthest point on your excursion, although the designation will change to 1800 at the end.\n\nTake the road 180 south from the highway. After just few minutes of driving you will come to a bridge crossing a very narrow body of water. Afther crossing the bridge you are in the archipelago. At this point it is useful to note that the first islands are not really different from the mainland. Further you go, the more exotic the scenery will come.\n\nFollow the road through the island group of Parainen until you reach a cable ferry port. Drive to the lane on the right hand side and wait for the ferry. Note that the local residents have a right of way, and the cars on other lanes will drive on to the ferry first. When it is your turn, drive on the ferry carefully, and park the car so that there is not too much empty space around it. Put the hand brake on and turn off the engine. After the ferry has departed (but not before) you can go outside to enjoy the scenery. Be sure to return to the car in time so that you will not delay those parked behind you. The cable ferries are a free public service.\n\nAfter the cable ferry you are in the island group of Nauvo. Drive through Nauvo, and take a cable ferry to Korppoo. In Korppoo, do the same. This time when you reach the cable ferry you should note that that there are two ferry routes departing from that point, to Norrskata and to Houtskari. You will wish to go to Houtskari. In Houtskari, you should take notes about the ferry timetables, because this ferry will run at longer intervals than the others. Continue along the main road, which is quite narrow this far out. Within Houtskari you will have to take two very short cable ferry rides along the way to reach the island of Nordanlands, better known as Mossala. At the end of the road you will find another ferry port, this time for ferries operating on longer routes just few times per day. Do not continue further unless you plant to spend the night at your destination. Reaching this point should take 1.5-2.5 hours from the highway, depending on your luck with the ferry timetables.\n\nAfter reaching the end of the road, you should return along the same route, but this time making as many stops and detours as time allowes. Don't be afraid to explore the smaller side roads. Often you will end up in the backyard of somebody's summer cottage, but you may also find breathtaking scenery, wild rasberies, a farm selling fresh produce straight from a barn, a tiny picturesque fishing community or many other things. Especially on smaller islands it is almost impossible to get lost, since there are only a few roads, and all of them will eventually lead either to the sea or to the main road.\n\nI addition to inpromptu exploration you may wish to see the some of the following sites:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The medieval churches in the main villages of Nauvo and Korppoo"]},{"type":"*","value":[" The Rumar Weather Radar (Rumarin Säätutka) in Korppoo, which also doubles as an observation tower"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Näsby, the beautiful main village of Houtskari"]},{"type":"*","value":[" The Marina in Nauvo, which also has restaurants and other services"]},{"type":"*","value":[" The ruins of Kuusisto Castle at Kuusisto, the very first island along the way"]},"\nThere are restaurants, cafés and kioks dotted all over the islands. You should note, however, that the area is sparsely populated, and often it is not useful to try to look for other options once an acceptable restaurant has been found. There is a restaurant in Mossala at the furthest point in this itinerary.\n\nThis itinerary can be conveniently combined with the Turku excursion (see below), by spending two days.\n\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Helsinki Zoo (half day) "]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Helsinki Zoo"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["Korkeasaaren eläintarha"]}," in Finnish)is located on the island of Korkeasaari, off the eastern side of the city centre.

In both summer and winter the island can be reached from the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Central Railway Station"]}," with the bus number 11, departing from the square on the eastern side of the station. The travel time is about 20-30 minutes, and the right stop is the last stop.\n\nThe island has restaurants and cafés. You should note that there are no restaurants and other facilities near the zoo entrance. If you need a lunch break after exiting the zoo, it is best to head back to the city centre.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Heureka Science Centre (half day) "]},"\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Heureka Science Centre"]}," educates the visitors about the laws of nature with numerous hands-on exhibits. The centre can be enjoyed by both adults and children. To reach Heureka, take a commuter train from the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Central Railway Station"]}," to Tikkurila. You will be crossing a tarif zone, meaning that your normal tourist ticket will not be valid on this trip. One way ticket to Tikkurila costs four euros. From the station, follow the signs to ",{"type":"'''","value":["Heureka"]},".\n\nThere is a lunch restaurant in ",{"type":"'''","value":["Heureka"]},". The area north of the Tikkurila station also has many restaurants, but don't expect to find gourmet cuisine here. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Nuuksio National Park (full day) "]},"\n\nFor a serious wilderness experience, go hiking in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nuuksio National Park"]]},".

You might also turn to little side track to the islet in the middle of the bridge. The narrow path, which include duckboards, will take you the islet of Pukkisaari, where you can find a recreation of an iron age dwelling.\n\nTo get there, take the bus 24 from the centre of the city. The bus leaves from Erottaja and goes along Mannerheimintie before turning to Arkadiankatu. The bridge to ",{"type":"'''","value":["Seurasaari"]}," is located at the last bus stop. \n\nSeurasaari is one of the few places in Helsinki where a tourist might sometimes encounter mosquitos. They don't spread any diseases, but the bites will itch, sometimes for days. Get some repellent, or if the weather permits, wear clothing that covers as much skin as possible. If you do get bitten, don't scratch the bites, as this will just make them worse.\n\nOn the way back you might want to stop at the Rajasaarentie bus stop, located along the Mechelininkatu. From there, you can walk into the park to see the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Sibelius monument"]},", celebrating the internationally acclaimed Finnish composer. If it is summer, the monument is easiest to find by following hordes of tourists.\n\nFor lunch, your best option would be a picnic. A good selection of groceries can be found from the K Market store in the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Kamppi Centre"]}," (Kampin Keskus), between Urho Kekkosen katu and Salomonkatu. For the real delicacies, go for the basement of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Stockmann department store"]}," (between the streets Pohjoisesplanadi, Keskuskatu, Aleksanterinkatu and Mannerheimintie).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Some serious shopping (half day \/ full day) "]},"\n\nThe main shopping areas in Helsinki are located along a east-west axis. In the east, the axis starts with the parallel streets of Aleksanterinkatu and Pohjoisesplanadi. Next on the way is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Stockmann department store"]}," (between the streets Pohjoisesplanadi, Keskuskatu, Aleksanterinkatu and Mannerheimintie). The axis ends in the west with the adjacent shopping malls of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Forum"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Kamppi Centre"]},". It is best to start from one end of the axis and stroll towards the other end.\n\nFor design products, you should try the Design District Helsinki web page (",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.designdistrict.fi\/design_district"]},")\n\nSpecialised boutiques selling clothing, jewelry, art, delicacies and curios can be found from the southern part of the city centre, on the streets Fredrikinkatu, Tehtaankatu and Kasarmikatu, including surrounding blocks and side streets. These shops are not, however concentrated on any particular spots, so finding them requires either a bit of luck or a bit of time.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Turku excursion (full day) "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Turku Cathedral and Aura River.jpg"],["thumb"],["The Turku Cathedral by the Aura River from a distance"]]},"\n\nThis itinerary will take you away from Helsinki.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Turku"]]}," is the oldest city in Finland, and also the first capital city. Much of the old buildings have been destroyed by fire, war and urban planners, but the city still has several major historical sites, as well as few modern attractions. See the relevant article for more details.\n\nTo reach Turku, you need to take a train from the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Central Railway Station"]}," in Helsinki. The trains depart every hour during the day, and a return ticket costs about 50 euros. The journey time is about two hours. When you reach Turku, you should actually depart the train at the Kupittaa station, one stop before the Turku Central Station. From there, you can take either one of the busses 32 and 42 to the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Turku Cathedral"]},", the seat of the Lutheran archbishop of Finland. The cathedral will be clearly visible from the bus on the right, but if you miss it, leave the bus immediately after crossing the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Aura River"]}," and backtrack.\n\nAfter viewing the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Turku Cathedral"]},", most of the major sights in the city are within easy walking distance on the western side. The only exception may be the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Turku Castle"]},", which is perhaps the most important attraction in the city.
