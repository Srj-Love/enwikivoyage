It was destroyed and rebuilt many times.\n\nAfter the fall of the communist government in Afghanistan in the early 1990s, the city changed it face due to the many development works under Ismail Khan (or Amir Ismail Khan), a local Jihadi commander who ruled Herat until the Taliban takeover. After the fall of Taliban and the establishment of the Karzai Government, Ismail Khan became the governor of this province and built on his earlier works.\n \nThe people are very friendly and hospitable to foreigners and are also more religious than people in Kabul. Many of the young understand English or other foreign languages.
