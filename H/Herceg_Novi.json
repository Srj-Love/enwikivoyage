In spite of this tourist boom, the city has managed to some extent to keep the traditional slow Montenegrin lifestyle. The locals are very welcoming and you are never annoyed by street vendors.\n\nA sizeable Bosnian (Serb) refugee population flooded into Herceg Novi during the war years.  Many of the camps are still around although they have been turned into more permanent (and quite nice) settlements.  You can still see them on the bus as you leave the city.  Also if you go for a wander up into the hills you will come into whole new areas of construction resulting from the recent property boom.\n\nThe Financial Times in 2007 listed Montenegro as one of world's 10 top property hotspots and foreign buyers have been snapping up properties on the coast.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nBus is the only form of public transport in\/out of Herceg Novi, and the bus station (located in the centre of town) is busy the day long with buses heading (mostly) down the Adriatic coast.  There is a regular bus service to Herceg Novi (and further to other Montenegrin cities) from main bus station in Dubrovnik, which runs several times a day. It costs about €9 and takes about one hour. There are also quite regular busses to Kotor, Budva, Bar and Podgorica.\n\nIf Herceg Novi is your main destination, a pleasant alternative to bus travel is hiring a Croat cab from Dubrovnik airport (Cilipi) for about €50; this trip takes about 40 minutes, including border crossings.\n\nThere is NO rail or ferry access into the town.\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.taxi-service.me Airport and City Transfer"]}]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.montenegro-car-rent.com Taxi and Airport Shuttle"]}]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nBy foot\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Klostret Savina i Herceg Novi.jpg"],["thumb"],["Savina Monastery"]]}," \n",{"type":"*","value":[" The Herceg Novi old town is amazing.

Many small privately owned beaches have loungers, small boats, and other gear for hire."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Mud therapy - At the western end of the promenade is a small spa town of Igalo, renowned across Europe for healing properties of its muddy, mildly radioactive sand.  A health and hospital centre complex offers mud therapy combined with other treatments, but you can do it yourself by following the locals and wading through the sand.  Apply the muddy sand all over your body, or on affected parts, and combine with gentle exercise and sunbathing for best effects.

Count approximately €10-12 for the main dish in a typical restaurant (grilled high-quality fish is more expensive). Almost all cafes serve pizza which is usually well-made.  Follow the locals; Montenegrins are usually more picky than foreign tourists when it comes to eating out.\n\nThe Petica in the centre of the Old Town is a great place to sit, drink an espresso, or have some fairly priced pasta\/pizza. 4-7E. The service is very friendly and the food is delicious.\n\nThe Tre Lipe restaurant is conveniently located next to the Sea Fort (Forte Mare), 20 meters from the beach.

Iced coffee is served in tall glasses with dolops of ice cream and \"slag\" (fatty whipped cream) and qualifies as a full meal.
