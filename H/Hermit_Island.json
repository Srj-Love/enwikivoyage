[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.hermitisland.com Hermit Island"]}]}," is a small peninsula — nearly an island — in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Maine"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nHermit Island is a campground located in Small Point, Maine. The campground has many features and amenities including, eight private white sand beaches, a full boating marina, four hiking trails, and many campsites. The white sand beaches are natural, and since no visitors are allowed into the campground, they often have no people on them. The sands sparkle and the water is warm, making the beaches a great place to swim, sunbathe, or just relax. The beaches are Head Beach, Sand Dune Beach, West Dune Beach, Sunset Lagoon, Spring Beach, Sailboat Beach, Bounty Cove Beach, and Sand Dollar Beach. Most are accessible by car, but Spring Beach is only accessible on foot. The beaches also have many tidepools to explore. Hermit Island also has a full boating marina, located on the northern part of the island. The marina rents out rowboats, canoes, and moorings for people coming in by boat. The island also has a Yankee boat, which takes campers on nature and sunset tours daily on Casco Bay. This, and a boat ramp, are located at a dock on Harbor Grove. The waters of Casco Bay and The Branch are also perfect for fishing, especially for lobster. The island also has four hiking trails which wind across the island. The red trail goes right along the coast with astounding views while the white, orange, and blue trails wind through the forest which is full of animal and bird life. The campsites on the island are located on the southern part of the island, with forest on the northern part. Campsites are split into four groups, ocean prime, prime, choice, and value. Ocean prime sights are either right on the beach or have astounding views of Casco Bay. Prime sites normally have great views, choice sights normally have partial ocean views or a short walk to the beach, and value sights are buggy and in the middle of the woods. Hermit Island's main hall is the Kelp Shed, located at the entrance to the island. The Kelp Shed has the check in desk, a snack bar\/restaurant, a game room, live entertainment weekly, a large stone fireplace, a volleyball net, and ping pong tables, and it is also the place to sign up for various island activities. You can also apply for a permit to go clam fishing in the bay in front of the Kelp Shed. The store is located next to the Kelp Shed, and provides campers with necessities, food, groceries, supplies, firewood, ice, and fresh seafood including clams, steamers, and live lobsters. The gift shop is located behind the store and sells postcards, tee shirts, and other various gifts. There is also a small laundry room under the gift shop with dryers only.
