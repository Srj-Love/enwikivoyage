Theft or interference with cars may occur, but only if left in the more unpleasant areas overnight.\n\nUsual instructions apply, if a crime\/emergency is in progress call 999 or 112 and ask for Police\/Fire\/Ambulance as needed. There are main police stations (generally open 9-5) in Watford, St.Albans, Hatfield and Stevenage and smaller ones in all the other towns.\n\nHospitals (with A+E) in Welwyn Garden City (QEII), Stevenage (Lister), St. Albans (St. Albans City) and Watford (Watford General).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["East_of_England"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Hertfordshire"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["51.9"],["-0.2"]]}]
