The coast is predominantly affected by the south east trade winds which keep a cool breeze throughout the summer.\n\nHervey Bay was discovered by Captain James Cook in 1770 while he was travelling the east coast of Australia. He wrongly assumed that Fraser Island was joined to the Australian mainland and the sheltered waters behind it were a bay. The waters of the Great Sandy Strait are very shallow and he did not proceed far enough south to find the passage between Fraser Island and the coast. He named the bay \"Hervey's Bay\" after Lord Augustus Hervey an admiral of the Blue, the Earl of Bristol and Captain Cook's boss.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By plane "]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Hervey Bay Airport (HVB)"]}," airport is around 4km from Urangan, or a few minutes drive.
