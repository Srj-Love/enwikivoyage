Wycombe is also served by buses to and from many of the nearby towns and villages, though due to the sheer number of traffic lights installed along London Road and around the entrance to the bus station it's generally quicker to walk. There are also bus services to Oxford and Stansted Airport.\n\nThe town boasts a spacious park and ride facility, see ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.parkandride.net\/highwycombe\/wycombe_frameset.shtml National Park and Ride Directory"]}," which unfortunately stops running at 19:00 - rendering it useless to anyone wanting to have dinner, visit the cinema or go late-night shopping. At 18:30, however, the Eden Car Park changes its pricing plan to £1.50 for the rest of the evening.\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nBuses: Buckinghamshire County Council have a guide to bus services in the High Wycombe area. http:\/\/www.buckscc.gov.uk\/travelinfo\/Services\/WycombeIndex.htm\n\nTrains: Chiltern Railways serve High Wycombe.

In restaurants the choice really is not great, especially beer.\n\nThere is a pub called The Antelope, which although rough in appearance serves only drink and is popular every night of the week.
