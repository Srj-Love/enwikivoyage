A summer-long festival featuring music of all types. The summer home of the Chicago Symphony. Other orchestras (like the Ravinia Festival Orchestra) play there as well as various pop and jazz performers. You can choose to sit in the pavilion (which costs a bit more), or bring a blanket and chairs and sit on the large lawn. Chairs are also available for rental at the park. It has a few places to buy food and drinks (including wine and beer), however, prices are a bit steep and food (and alcohol) may be brought into the park. Certain classical concerts are free for college students with a college ID. If you go, definitely buy some Ravinia ice cream (not the Dove stuff). If you sit in the Pavilion you get a special program. If you sit on the lawn, you'll have to go and find one of the green newspaper dispensersâ€”-they hold the lawn programs. Ravinia often hosts family-friendly concerts but for more sophisticated shows, you should either leave the kids at the hotel or make sure that they will be well behaved. Very easy to get to via Metra North Line; Ravinia has its own stop, which only operates on days with performances. Costs $3.90 each way on weekdays and $5.00 roundtrip on weekends from Ogilvie Transportation Center.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nIn downtown Highland Park, there is a Port Clinton Square which is a small shopping center.
