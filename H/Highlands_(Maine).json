But, it isn't true wilderness, you pass 2 logging highways, and several smaller roads.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Mount Katahdin"]},", A very impressive mountain range, including Baxter Peak, a high point, well above treeline, at over 5300 feet, that is also the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail, and the southern terminus of the International Appalachian Trail.  A very tough climb from below 1000 feet if you take the Hunt Trail (AT) Or, maybe not so tough if you start from the very remote Chimney Pond at 2900 feet.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Baxter State Park"]},", Donated to the state by former governor Percival Baxter, this is a very wild park.  All camping by reservation, (but often openings come available).  Everything is carry in\/carry out, there is no potable water and no trash cans.  Rangers are very friendly and helpful.  Lots of hiking trails.  Lots of Peaks and Lakes and chipmonks.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Gulf Hagas"]},", An impressive canyon with lot's of waterfalls on the west branch of the Pleasant River.  A rugged 10 mile day hike, if you have time, or a 5 mile detour off the AT, if you are hiking through.  This is on Katahdin Iron Works road, somewhere west of Maine 11.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Katahdin Iron Works"]},", Ruins of an 1825 Iron Works.  The only thing left is the rock\/brick furnace, and one (of 9 original) Charcoal Kilns.  Ore was mined locally and trees harvested for charcoal, and the pig iron was made here.  On Katahdin Iron Works Road, somewhere west of Maine 11.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Barren Slides"]},", Excellent views with a relatively short (but rugged) day hike.
