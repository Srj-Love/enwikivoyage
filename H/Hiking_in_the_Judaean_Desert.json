From Arad, follow the signs to Masada (route 3199 northeast). Between kilometer posts 9 and 10, turn left to a black-marked dirt trail ",{"type":"{{","value":[["Israel trail mark"],["black"]]},". Follow it for 3.5 km to the campground. An additional 1.5 km will take you to the stream's path itself. The road goes on for there but is only fit for 4×4 vehicles. From that point you can turn left on a green trail ",{"type":"{{","value":[["Israel trail mark"],["green"]]}," for the upper stream, or right on blue trail ",{"type":"{{","value":[["Israel trail mark"],["blue"]]}," to reach the ",{"type":"''","value":["Birket Zfira"]}," water basin or the lower stream.\n\n;As part of a backpacking trip: Many marked trails descend from the desert highland into the Ze'elim creek, reaching from the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Mishmar Stream"],["Mishmar Stream"]]}," north of it, Masada in the south or other locations.

The canyon begins just below the Birket Zfira water basin and the other end of the trail is at the campground near the lower end of the stream. This section of the Ze'elim Stream is the more popular one for hiking trips and contains several hiking options. Unlike the upper section, it's not inside any firing zone, so it's open for hiking on all times. However, the entire area ",{"type":"'''","value":["is"]}," a nature reserve, and certain ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hiking_and_backpacking_in_Israel#Nature reserves"],["regulations"]]}," must be observed.\n\nBelow are descriptions of several points of interest in the trail, followed by suggestions for hikes.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[{"type":"''","value":["Gey Sla'im"]}," (\"Rocky Gorge\")"]},"\nA deeper part of the canyon found pretty close to the lower campground, where the trail is extremely rough because of many boulders and multiple large rocks which make the hiking very difficult here.

This is because several large boulders and small waterfalls would require you to climb with your hands; however, the ground here is pretty level and convenient, unlike the rough terrain of the other gorge. During winter there may be some water basins that you'd have to cross by entering them or find someway to climb around.\n\nHikers who choose to enter this section and not use the bypass are advised to bring a rope fit for climbs of about 7 meters, as there are two waterfalls (usually dry) that are a little hard to climb without one. Generally there's a rope set there \"permanently\", but it gets washed away during floods; you can ask at the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hiking_and_backpacking_in_Israel#Consult"],["Ein-Gedi Field School"]]}," what's the current status. Also, an elongated water basin may require you, during winter and spring, to walk about 20 meters in waist- to chest-deep water. This may be a bit difficult if you have a large backpack which you want to keep dry.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[{"type":"''","value":["Ein Nammer"]}," (\"Leopard Spring\")"]},"\nA emanation of water with two ponds below it.
