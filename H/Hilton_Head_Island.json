After traveling about a mile on the island, the road splits in two. \nWilliam Hilton Parkway continues as ",{"type":"'''","value":["US 278 Business"]},", a surface road around the eastern end of the island. US 278 Business is a four-lane divided highway, but most businesses on the island are along the road, making for a slow, 25-to-30-minute drive to the southern end of the island. \nUS 278 itself branches off onto the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cross Island Parkway"]},", a grade-separated expressway. The Cross Island Parkway is a toll road, costing $1.25 for most passenger cars. The parkway reduces the journey from the split to the south end of the island to five minutes.\nBoth US 278 and US 278 Business terminate at the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Sea Pines Circle"]}," at the south end of the island. From this circle, cars can continue south on Greenwood Drive to enter the gated Sea Pines plantation, or east on Pope Avenue to head towards Coligny Beach, the major public beach on the island.\n\nHilton Head is quite ",{"type":"[[","value":[["cycling"]]},"-friendly. All main roads and most major roads in the resort plantations have a companion bicycle path, and there are a few miles of paths that cut their own trail away from the roads. Although not lit for night riding, they are the perfect way to traverse the island during the day time hours. Bicycle rental stores are plentiful, although they may be expensive.\n\nAlong with the convenience of bicycle travel, however, come a few rules to be followed. The most important rule, as with most bicycle path systems, is that cars always have the right of way when crossing the street. All bicycles are expected to stop and yield to cars at all street crossings. Most crossings have bicycle-sized stop signs and painted stop lines to remind riders of this fact. Bicycles may cross only when the street is clear or a car stops and yields the right of way. Riders are also expected to ride on the right side of the paths. Some golf courses may open up their cart paths to bicycles during non-playing hours (in the morning and at night), but other than this it is generally not a good idea to stray off the paths.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Harbour Town"]},".
