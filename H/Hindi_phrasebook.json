",{"type":"''","value":["Namaskār"]}," has the same meaning, but is used less often in Hindi, though it is common in other Indian languages such as Gujarati and Bengali. ",{"type":"''","value":["Namaskār"]}," is thought of as more formal, and as such is used more often when addressing a group or a person of importance.

After meeting someone for the first time ",{"type":"''","value":["āpse milkar bahut ",{"type":"<","value":["u",["kh"]]},"uśī huī."]}," may be said, meaning \"after meeting you much happiness has happened (to me).\"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Civilities:"]}," In Western cultures, saying phrases like ",{"type":"''","value":["please"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["thank you"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["you're welcome"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["excuse me"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["sorry"]},", etc. are so ingrained into us from a young age that we say them without a second thought. Not so for Indians. Saying such phrases in an inappropriate circumstance might even embarrass the person, or cheapen the gravity of the phrase itself. These phrases are only said in a sincere sense. For example, don't say धन्यवाद (thank you) after a clerk hands you your grocery bag, but when someone goes out of their way to do something nice for you. Sometimes, English words themselves are used; due to the British colonial influence, especially in urban areas and among the upper class. In this case, use them as you would in English. Just remember that like Germans and the French, they sometimes have trouble with English ",{"type":"''","value":["th"]}," sounds and therefore pronounce ",{"type":"''","value":["th"]}," as थ. When someone is in your way, instead of saying ",{"type":"''","value":["excuse me,"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["zara suniye"]},", just let out an aspirated ",{"type":"''","value":["ts"]}," sound with your tongue behind your teeth to attract their attention. This might seem rude, but is no more rude than children saying \"pssst\" to get a friend's attention during class! In conclusion, though Hindi has corresponding words to ours, this does not mean that the context in which they are used also correspond likewise. Don't let all of this lead you to believe Indians are cold though – nothing could be further from the truth! These sentiments are merely communicated through body language rather than verbally. To show your thanks, a simple smile will do the trick. Other common gestures include the infamous \"head bobble\"; and a hand gesture made by swiftly swinging the wrist so your palm is facing the sky and your forefingers slightly elongated. Before travelling to India, rent some Bollywood films so that if a spontaneous Bhangra breaks out in the streets, you'll be ready to join in! All kidding aside, they can demonstrate body language and customs far better than any book is able to, all while acclimatizing you to the language as well.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Prefixes & Suffixes:"]}," With the words for \"yes\" and \"no\" ",{"type":"''","value":["jī"]}," (जी) may be added before to give it a more polite tone. Sometimes, speakers will simply reply with ",{"type":"''","value":["jī"]},", as an affirmation of something someone says. ",{"type":"''","value":["Jī"]}," is added to a person's name as a sign of respect. For example; in India, Mahatma Gandhi is known simply as ",{"type":"''","value":["Gandhiji"]}," (गांधीजी). Another suffix which is indispensable is ",{"type":"''","value":["vāla"]}," (-वाला), often rendered in English as \"-wallah\". Many books devote whole chapters to vāla. With nouns, it gives the meaning \"the one or thing that does\" and with verbs, it indicates something is about to happen. Examples:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" noun – shop (दुकान ",{"type":"''","value":["dukān"]},") + ",{"type":"''","value":["vāla"]}," = shopkeeper (दुकानवाला ",{"type":"''","value":["dukānvāla"]},")"]},{"type":"*","value":[" verb –  to come (आना ",{"type":"''","value":["āna"]},") + ",{"type":"''","value":["vāla"]}," = (the) ... is coming (... आनेवाला है ",{"type":"''","value":["... ānevāla hay"]},")"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["English Loan Words:"]}," The British Empire's influence spread into the language itself, and this continues today with American culture being exported throughout the world. So, an English word or phrase may almost always be inserted into any Hindi sentence. You will often hear Indians, whom while talking in Hindi, pepper their sentences with English words. Sometimes, they'll even alternate sentences, going from Hindi to English, and back to Hindi! Upon meeting an Indian, many times you may not even get to practice your Hindi, because they want to practice ",{"type":"''","value":["their"]}," English on ",{"type":"''","value":["you"]},"! English loan words are particularly used for modern inventions\/technologies, so words like TV, computer and microwave are the same as in English apart from the slight change of accent.
