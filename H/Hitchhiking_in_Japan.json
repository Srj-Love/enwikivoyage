Coupled with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Urban camping in Japan"],["camping"]]},", you can effectively cut down your daily budget to food and admission fees alone — although it is wise to allow for the occasional (literal) rainy day.\n\nHitchhiking does present its own unique challenges, but the purpose of this article is to demonstrate that not only is hitching possible, it's downright easy... once you know how.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Where to hitch"]},"\nIt is almost impossible to hitch out of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tokyo"]]}," or any large Japanese city by waving your thumb on the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tokyo\/Ginza"],["Ginza"]]},".   Thus, to get out, you have to find the places where drivers going out congregate, which in practice means ",{"type":"'''","value":["service areas"]}," (サービスエリア ",{"type":"''","value":["sābisu eria"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["SA"]},") or ",{"type":"'''","value":["parking areas"]}," (",{"type":"'''","value":["PA"]},") on the large toll expressways (高速道路 ",{"type":"''","value":["kōsokudōro"]},") connecting Japan's major cities.  As you might guess, service areas are larger and better equipped than parking areas (with the special exception of Mekari\/Dannoura, see below), but surprisingly few Japanese are familiar with the difference so it's easier to label them all service areas.\n\nA useful rule of thumb (pun intended) is that if you can get somewhere on a train for less than 2000 yen, hitchhiking the distance is unlikely to be worth the trouble – for instance destinations around Tokyo such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mount Fuji"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hakone"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nikko"]]}," – until you actually get there, that is.  All three regions have expensive local transport but plenty of unhurried tourists driving about, always a good combination for the hitchhiker.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Getting on the expressway"]},"\nDue to a complex conspiracy, all SA\/PAs are located as inconveniently as possible, and entrance to them from outside on foot is officially prohibited. However, the inconvenience is manageable when you know the route (are you willing to sit on a local train for an hour to save 9000 yen?) and, as so often happens in Japan, official regulations go unenforced or downright ignored.\n\nAside from SA\/PAs, the second way to get on the expressway is to hitch outside an interchange. ICs do tend to be a bit closer to town, but in Tokyo they are usually in the middle of very heavy traffic and with few, if any, places where hitching is even remotely possible, so getting rides also takes considerably longer. It is generally preferable to sit on a local for an extra half an hour and maybe even pay a few yen for the privilege of not having to choke on exhaust for an hour.\n\nThe third method would be to take a long-distance bus that uses the expressway and stops at a parking area along the way.  However, cataloguing which routes go where on which roads and which service areas they stop at would be a fairly difficult enterprise, you'll also need to buy a rather expensive bus ticket just to get on the thing, and you'll probably freak out the bus attendants who will certainly notice if the only ",{"type":"''","value":["gaijin"]}," on the bus doesn't come back from the break.\n\nAn untested but quite valid possibility along these lines is to free yourself from the difficulties of hitching out of Tokyo by taking the cheap 3500 yen Orion \"youth\" (misnomer) night-bus towards Gifu via Nagoya, ideally on a Friday night. You truly get what you pay for here, but it makes a stop around sunrise at a major service area just east of Nagoya. If you can perhaps persuade the driver that this is in fact close to where you want to be (\"Thats my friend's house, right over there, really!\" - again, this is untested) you will be both on the expressways at an optimal place and awake early enough to get a morning headstart on a long-westbound hitch.\n\nAn excellent method to make it to the expressway is simple transporting yourself to a gas station which lies on a road heading to the expressway. Be sure to go to the correct side of the road, as there will obviously be more cars actually heading to the expressway (and remember that Japan drives on the left). If possible, explain the drivers that you simply wish to go to a service area at the highway. This is easiest with a good map that shows service areas or it can be done if you know the name of the expressway and say \"service area\". This method was done in Yokohama (on the way to Kyoto) with a total waiting time of 2 minutes, albeit with the assistance of a Japanese speaker.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Hitching on the expressway"]},"\nAt the SA\/PA itself, the best place to hitch is near the offramp to the expressway, ideally so that you're visible from the buildings — this way drivers can see you as they go in and think about picking you up before they get in their car and make the choice.  From a service area with decent traffic, you are very likely to get a ride within minutes. My suggestion here would be to hitch in front of the shops or at the end, close to the toilets. Reason for this is A: most people go to the toilet and B: you can talk to them so they will see you are a nice person as Japanese can be very suspicious.\n\nOnce you've made it onto the expressway, it's easy to keep bouncing from one SA\/PA to the next one, but a decent highway map is imperative so you know the best place to get off if your destination and your driver's path diverge.  Whenever possible, aim for SAs instead of PAs: not only do they have handy things like restaurants, maps and info counters, but they are much busier and thus much easier to hitchhike from.  It's entirely possible to cover 500 kilometers or more in a single day by using expressways. A good example of a possible trip is to go from Tokyo to Kyoto in one day.\n\nNote that it is ",{"type":"'''","value":["illegal"]}," to stop a car or walk on foot anywhere on the expressway itself, including tollbooths, and you will be rapidly picked up by the highway police if you try.  Do not allow your driver to drop you off outside a service area.\n\nIf you have a Japanese friend or some skills, producing a sign with your destination in Japanese from a piece of cardboard is a good way to inform drivers of your destination and it might increase your chances of finding drivers that can take you longer distances.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Hitching elsewhere"]},"\nOutside the expressway system on ordinary toll-free national highways (国道 ",{"type":"''","value":["kokudō"]},"), there are also occasional service areas of a sort, known as ",{"type":"''","value":["Michi-no-Eki"]}," (道の駅), lit. \"Road stations\" ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.michi-no-eki.net\/"]},".  With about 900 scattered all around Japan, these are ",{"type":"''","value":["excellent"]}," places to get dropped off, fuel up, consult maps and grab rides.\n\nOther traditional favorites include the offramps of roadside gas stations and convenience stores.  The keys are ",{"type":"'''","value":["visibility"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["accessibility"]},": drivers have to be able to spot you in advance, and they have to be able to stop  and pick you up without endangering themselves or others.\n\nNote that it is ",{"type":"'''","value":["illegal"]}," to hitchhike near road crossings or from bus stops, although in rural areas where buses drop by just 2-3 times a day the latter is often tolerated.  The very end of a merging lane after a crossing is also OK, as long as you are more than 5 meters away from the crossing itself.  In general, hitchhiking is legal and Japanese police don't hassle hitchhikers, but they do have fairly wide-ranging powers to act on anything that disturbs or distracts traffic, so use common sense.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["How to hitch"]},"\nExcept for the occasional impoverished student in the wide expanses of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hokkaido"]]},", there is very little tradition of hitchhiking in Japan, and you will more likely than not be the first hitchhiker that your driver has ever even seen, much less picked up.  The key to hitchhiking is thus to assuage these fears and look as ",{"type":"'''","value":["harmless and friendly"]}," as possible.\n\nThe top worries of a Japanese driver when they see a hitchhiking gaijin are: Can he ",{"type":"'''","value":["communicate"]},"? Does he know how to behave?   The quick way to answer those questions is with a sign: 日本語できる！ (",{"type":"''","value":["Nihongo dekiru!"]},"), literally \"I can speak Japanese!\", is just six characters and works like a charm.  And you don't really need to know Japanese all that well to use such a sign, as long as you can communicate... somehow...\nPlease only write it down if you can speak a little, otherwise it will be an awkward ride for the both of you. Keep in mind that most Japanese understand basic English words when written down; it's the key once you get lost in translation.\n\nSecond on the agenda is ",{"type":"'''","value":["appearance"]},".  This is not the place for a mop of unruly hair, ripped jeans and sunglasses — foreigners are by default scary, and you need to do your best to look like you stepped out of an L.L. Bean catalog.  Neat trousers, clean shirt, a hat to protect you from the sun instead of sunglasses. If you have a huge rucksack, put it off to the side and make sure it's clean and that there are no things sticking out. Cute emoji on your hitching sign, or smiles in the gaps in your kanji characters can be a surprisingly effective addition in Japan.\n\nWith these down pat, it's time to ",{"type":"'''","value":["assume the pose"]}," and hitch.  Hitchhiking being an unusual phenomenon, the best-recognized pose will be the classic Western style: left hand extended straight, thumb up, facing traffic and a winning smile on your face.  Try to look drivers in the eye as they approach and perhaps even make a small bow of appreciation, especially if they slow down to take a better look at you or, better yet, loop back for a second look. And persevere: you may get picked up by the first car, or you may have to wait a while, but you ",{"type":"''","value":["will"]}," be picked up sooner or later.\n\nOnce the car does stop, a window will roll down and you will almost always be asked a simple question: ",{"type":"''","value":["Doko made?"]}," (\"To where?\")  Do not make the mistake of giving your final destination, as the driver may assume that you will insist on going all the way.  (This is also why it's usually not wise to use a destination sign.)  Instead, pick the nearest major waypoint and state ",{"type":"''","value":["X no hō"]}," (\"In the direction of X\"). It is wise to ask in the service area if they can drop you off at the next major service area. Once in the car they will ask you where you are going and you will ask them and so you can ride along until you want to get out.\n\nAn alternative sign which can be quite handy is 次のＳＡまでお願いいたします (tsugi no saabisu eria made onegai itashimasu); literally next service area, pretty please, with a cherry on top. This has a fair few advantages in that the duration of the ride is made very clear. Naturally, once you reach the final service area before your destination, flip the sign over and scrawl your actual destination on the back to get off the expressway itself. When undertaking this last step, being very slow and methodic using a rather thin pen can be quite advantageous because the very act of seeing a foreigner actually ",{"type":"''","value":["writing"]}," kanji on a sign themselves, from memory will attract more than a couple of viewers and potential rides.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["When to hitch"]},"\nLike other tourism in Japan, the best times of year are spring and fall, when it's not too hot and not too cold.  Hitching in the summer risks sunburn and dehydration, while winter is simply too cold. When its colder, become friendlier, so stay in the service area with a nice hot drink and just approach the people.\n\nDistasteful as it may be to get up at 6 AM on vacation, as a hitchhiker you must get an ",{"type":"'''","value":["early start"]},".  Many of the longest rides are available early in the morning, and your hitchhiking day will come to an end when the sun goes down.\n\nIf the weather is bad, it's best to give up hitchhiking for the day and figure out something else to do.  A sodden figure standing forlornly in the rain with his thumb out is not a pitiful figure in Japan, he's a dangerous lunatic. Again, just go inside and they will offer you drinks and food.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Who to hitch with"]},"\nIn Japan, as everywhere else, your ",{"type":"'''","value":["gender"]}," matters when hitchhiking.  On an ascending scale of difficulty, the best combinations are:\n# Girl alone (but see below)\n# Two girls\n# Boy and girl couple\n# Boy alone\n# Two boys\n# Three or more people\n\nWhile a single girl (or woman) is likely to get picked up very fast, this has its risks: Japan has its fair share of perverts and predators and a lone hitchhiker in a foreign country is a vulnerable target.\n\nAs for ",{"type":"'''","value":["who will pick you up"]},", the range of humanity you will encounter is surprising and, once you've crossed the threshold into their car, the generosity and trust will amaze you.  You will be picked up by young couples, grizzled old farmers, families with small children, traveling salesmen, single women, ",{"type":"''","value":["yakuza"]}," mobsters, Buddhist monks...  and, almost without exception, you will be offered drinks and snacks, bought lunch and quite possibly offered a  bed for the night.   But try to distinguish between offers of genuine goodwill and interest and offers out of duty or perceived obligation, as your driver is likely to feel that he is a host and he must treat you as an honored guest, despite any inconvenience or even financial expense that this might cause.\n\nAs a guest, you will not be allowed to pay any of the expenses, and even efforts to contribute something for gas and toll fares will most likely be delightfully refused.  Be thankful for this, as Japan's expressway tolls are ",{"type":"''","value":["extremely"]}," high: for example, the trip from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tokyo"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Osaka"]]}," costs around ¥8000 in tolls alone.  Instead, if you really want to thank your hosts, remember that Japan is the country of gifts and return gifts called ",{"type":"''","value":["okaeshi"]},": it might be a good idea to carry some small souvenirs of your country or hometown, like a country pin, or cookies (wrapped of course) or even an airline bottle of liquor. With this you will have really sealed a wonderful human interchange, and you may even make a friend for life.\n\nUpdate: Toll fares have been reduced significantly on weekends and nullified in a few places on weekdays. Traffic is already up 50%.

An easy place to get a ride in both directions, and also just a touch north of the central four-way interchange—ensure you confirm your desination with your rides.\n\nIf heading north on to Honshu, there is an extremely long gap, 2-3 times the usual between service areas so you'll have to make a stop over at a parking area, which is OK because...\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:DannouraMekari.JPG"],["thumb"],["180px"],["right"],["View from Dannoura PA on Honshu across to Kyushu.

Let's repeat this once more: Kyushu's busiest expressway rest stop is Mekari parking area (めかり) in Mojiko, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kitakyushu"]]},". Whilst a parking area in name, both Mekari, and its southbound sister parking area Dannoura (壇之浦) over the bridge in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shimonoseki"]]}," (on Honshu), are practically service areas. Dannoura even has its own dedicated motel. They pack amazing views of the Kanmon straights, once of the world's busiest shipping lanes and the restaurants and souvenir shops stock Fugu (deadly pufferfish, the famous local delicacy). As you can therefore imagine, they see an insane amount of traffic. Locals will claim that on weekends, ",{"type":"''","value":["every last Japanese tourist stops at these areas without fail"]},". Furthermore, if you happen to be starting from Kitakyushu or Shimonoseki, both areas are an easy saunter up a well marked path: follow the backstreets uphill from the fish market for Dannoura, take the stone steps besides near the Kanmon tunnel pedestrian elevator under the bridge for Mekari.\n\nBasically all service areas and the aforementioned special parking areas in Kyushu provide formal back entrances and auxiliary parking to allow farmers or tourists use of the restaurant or viewing platform facilities so if you can identify one close to a train station on Google Earth or Yahoo! Maps, expect easy and legal entry.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Getting into Tokyo"]},"\n95% of the time, once on the expressway, getting back to Tokyo is a piece of cake: your driver is also going to Tokyo, so he'll drop you off at the nearest train or subway station, and you can find your way home.  Problems arise the other 5% of the time, when your driver is going either through Tokyo or to a part of Tokyo extremely far from your part of Tokyo.  What to do?\n\nYour driver may exit the expressway just so you can get off, but this is a waste of time and money for him, as he has to fight his way back and pay an extra toll, so don't count on it.  The driver may also try to drop you off at a tollbooth or at an interchange, which will either get you in hot water from the authorities or dead from being hit by a car.  The least of three evils is thus getting dropped off at a service area.\n\nMoral of the story: when near a big city, feel free to reject rides that aren't going close enough.  There will be more.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Shuto Service Areas (aka Tokyo Re-entry)"]},"\nIf the service area is one of those listed in the Tokyo section above, you know how to get back.  If not, you have been left at a service area not listed for a good reason.  Almost all the 15+ parking areas on the Shuto are tiny (space for around 20 cars max), suspended multiple stories above the earth with entrance\/exit possible only through staff quarters, and inconveniently located to boot.  However, as getting out is a lesser crime, you may be able to sweet-talk somebody into unlocking those staff-only doors and letting you out, as long as you promise not to come back in.\n\nThe Shuto network is an indecipherable tangle that looks vaguely similar to the Tokyo subway system, except that most stations are accessible only when going in one direction and you have 5 seconds to decide whether to exit.  The parking areas are omitted from most maps, only specialty maps will usually show them.  One convention worth learning quickly: all routes and lanes going towards the center are ",{"type":"''","value":["nobori"]}," (上り, going up), whereas routes and lanes exiting Tokyo are ",{"type":"''","value":["kudari"]}," (下り, going down).  The majority of Shuto parking areas are ",{"type":"''","value":["nobori"]},"-only, a small saving grace for the hitchhiker coming in, but yet another reason why they're useless for exiting Tokyo.\n\nA historical footnote that may help your wrap your head around this warped system:\nThe circular nature of the Tokyo Shuto system is actually derived from Edo's ancient expansionary-focussed spiral town planning and the expressway routes are named after how many towns (区) the semicircular route passes through. As such, larger numbers imply you are further from the centre. Incidently, major non-expressway routes through Tokyo follow this same system, Kanpachi-dori is circle 8, and the Yamanote train line is in fact circle 5 or 6 or something.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Shuto 3 (高速3号)"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Connecting to"]},": Tōmei\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Yōga PA (用賀)"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Access"]},": Nobori only",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Last verified"]},": Never\n\nLocated at the very beginning of the Shuto, in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Setagaya"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Shuto 4 (高速4号)"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Connecting to"]},": Chūō\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Eifuku PA (永福)"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Access"]},": Nobori only",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Last verified"]},": Never\n\nSmall.

The third option was shown to me by a janitor to whom I pleaded my distress: at the furthestmost tip (from your arrival point) of the building is a door, which leads to a staircase, which leads outside.  The doors along the route may, or may not, be locked.  Once you do get out, one block straight and a few to the right will get you to Yoyogi station on the Yamanote\/O-Edo lines.  (Odakyu line Minami-Shinjuku station is also nearby.)\n\nNote that it might theoretically even be possible to get into the PA this way, literally through the back door, but I wouldn't recommend it—if the doors are locked you're out of luck, westbound is towards Tokyo, not out of it, the Shuto splits into about 17 different directions soon after the PA, and the PA deservedly gets little enough traffic as it is.
