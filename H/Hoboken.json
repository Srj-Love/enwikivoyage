Some places to find parking are Sinatra Drive by the Hudson River, or any street named after a president (besides Washington).  The city-run parking garages on Hudson Street and elsewhere are also a good option if you're worried about getting booted. The parking garages generally range from 3-5 dollars an hour and prices jump up if you leave the car over night. Some of the parking garages are also either for Hoboken residents or available in monthly payments only so, read the signs and ask people at the parking garages to double check.\n\nIf you ",{"type":"'''","value":["must"]}," park, read the signs on the street. Make sure that you ARE allowed to park where you're leaving your car. Most streets have one side reserved for Hoboken Residents, that are marked clearly with a green background and white letters.  These are Resident Only parking sides and you must have a resident permit to park theres. Keep in mind that street cleaning restrictions are in effect as well as a time limit of 4 hours for non-residents - after that, you should move your car.\n\nFinding a parking spot is so hard in Hoboken that they sell parking spaces for up to $40,000.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nWith a great assortment of prewar buildings (having great architectural features) and conspicuous lack of many corporate establishments, Hoboken is a great place to wander on foot. \n\nThe end of Pier A, which is just north of the historic, Hoboken Terminal (complete with Tiffany glass windows) containing the NJ Railway and PATH station offers great views of New York City. On a clear day the incredible panorama visible from the end of the pier stretches between the George Washington and Verrazano Narrows Bridges. In the summer months around 5:00-6:00pm one can often see huge cruise ships sailing by on their way out to sea en route to Bermuda and Canada. If you are an early riser (or up very late) the views of sunrise silhouetting the city from Pier A is unforgettable. It is also the perfect place to view the “Tribute in Light” (if they continue to do it) remembering the anniversary of September 11. Hoboken lost more of its residents in September 11th than any city other than New York. A memorial grove and flame shaped memorial is set up on Pier A to remember their sacrifice.  There are various parks spanning the waterfront from Pier A, all the way up to 15th Street.  Maxwell Park is the newest addition on Sinatra Drive.  \n\nJoin in Holiday celebrations in Hoboken. The city is full of people and celebrations when the holidays come around. New Years and 4th of July are two of the biggest holidays pulling in enormous crowds. The crowds gather for the numerous number of bars in Hoboken and to watch the beautiful fireworks show over the water.The fireworks are set off in the city but spectacular views of the fireworks can be seen from Hoboken, especially Pier A (mentioned above). Another huge holiday celebrated in Hoboken is St. Patricks day. Every year they hold a city parade where mass amounts of people gather and wandering down main roads to stop at all the bars. \n\nCastle Point on Hudson also offers a great view of New York City (day or night) directly across the Hudson.  It is located on the campus of Stevens Institute of Technology. Occasionally campus security can be a bit skittish so be prepared to be sent on your way by flashing lights and a siren even if you are doing nothing more than admiring the view. \n\nFrank Sinatra's birth place is on Monroe Street (near 4th St)\n\nIf you are a baseball fan, the site of the first baseball game is commemorated on a plaque at the intersection of  11th and Washington, right next to Helmers restaurant. \n\nOf course, the gritty and amazing Brando film, On The Waterfront was filmed in Hoboken. The parks on 4th & park and 11th & Hudson both were used as locations and can be easily recognized from the film even in their modern state. “I coulda’ been a contender…. “\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nWalk down Washington Street, there are many shops and restaurants here.\nVisit Maxwell's, it's a great bar\/restaurant and music venue.  \nStop in Tunes and buy some music, a nice little music shop.

A small area of this park is dedicated to the ~25 residents of Hoboken who were killed in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\nIf you ride skateboards or Rollerblades, there is a small skatepark along the Hudson River (with spectacular Manhattan views) about 1 mile north of the PATH station.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Maru"],["url="],["email="],["address=219 Washignton between 2nd and 3rd street"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +1 201 798-3311"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Monday - Thursday: 11 am to 11 pm Friday: 11 am to 11:30 pm Saturday: 11:30 am to 11:30 pm Sunday: 11:30 am to 11 pm"],["price=Sushi rolls range from 3 - 15 (for specialty rolls) dollars.
