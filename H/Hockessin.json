Centered between two major highways, Route 7, or Limestone Road, and Route 41, Lancaster Pike, Hockessin offers a quiet reprieve for travelers and residents alike. The center of town is based mostly around small businesses; locally owned restaurants, salons, boutiques, and a smattering of other commercial establishments. A laid-back atmosphere, peaceful neighborhoods, and picturesque scenery all make Hockessin an extremely desirable place to live, hence the recent inrush of new residents. \n\nCentered almost exactly between New York City and Washington D.C., Hockessin has a climate that combines \"the best of both worlds.\" Winters and summers vary year to year, and any type of weather is possible for Delaware's usually moderate climate. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["By car"]},"\n\nHockessin is only accessible by car or bus, due to the fact that it has no airport \nor train stations. A short commute by automobile from the City of Wilmington, which \nboasts a bustling train station, and a roughly 45 minute drive from Philadelphia, mass \nforms of transportation are within a short distance. Also working their way through \nthe town on a daily basis are DART buses, which travel throughout Delaware.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get Around"]},"\n\nHockessin, being a small town, is easy to get around simply by walking around. \nIt doesn't necessarily have a main street per se, but Old Lancaster Pike is seen that way; it \nis usually one of the busier roads in town. That being said, Hockessin is divided into to halves; the Old Lancaster Pike\/Lancaster Pike side, and the Lantana Square\/Limestone Road side. Valley Road connects the two.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.delawarenaturesociety.org\/ashland.html Ashland"]},"  Nature Center serves as the Delaware Nature Society's headquarters and the hub for all of its activities of education and natural resource conservation.

Every year, old cars, firetrucks, local groups, bands, and even a few politicians parade down Old Lancaster Pike in celebration of Independence Day. The Neighborhood Relays are held earlier in the morning; they allow local neighborhoods to see which is top dog when it comes to athletics; Stenning Woods is always a strong contender! Finally, the town of Hockessin rounds off the night with a usually stunning fireworks display; they've been getting better every year.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\nLooking to buy a souvenir to remember your trip?

Their flavors range from normal chocolate and vanilla to experimental flavors that change yearly. If you like their ice cream enough and want to take some home, they also offer ice cream to go in quarts.
