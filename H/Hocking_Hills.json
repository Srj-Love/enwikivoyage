As long as you stay on the paved, narrow, winding roads, you should have few problems. If you wander off onto the logging or coal mine roads, be prepared for potholes, bad roads, mud and very little, if any traffic to ask for assitance. Much of this area is not served by cell phone towers and you will have little to no communications. The area is popular with hunters and all terrain vehicle users. Rumor has it that the area is also popular with marijuana growers. During hunting season,  wear brightly-colored clothing if you go into the woods.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Southeast_Ohio"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["extraregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Hocking Hills"]]}]
