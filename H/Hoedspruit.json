You have to go through a gate into the reserve, but if you look like you are on the way to a flight the guard will wave you through.

However, the attractions of the area don't lie in the town itself, and public transport is limited.  So you almost certainly need to hire a car or be on an arranged tour or transfer.\n\nThere are various private transfer companies such as Eastgate Safaris.\n\nThere are a couple of car hire companies in Hoedspruit such as Avis and Europcar.\n\nIt is sensible to pre-arrange your car-hire before you arrive.
