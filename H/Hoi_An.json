The Old Town of Hoi An is listed as a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["UNESCO World Heritage Site"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nHoi An, once known as ",{"type":"''","value":["Faifo"]},", with more than 2,000 years of history, was the principal port of the Cham Kingdom, which controlled the strategic spice trade with Indonesia from the 7th-10th centuries and was a major international port in the 16th and 17th centuries. The foreign influences are discernible to this day.\n\nThe culture and heritage is mostly from the Cham people whose kingdom originally stretched from Hue south to Phan Tiet (south of Nha Trang). The Champas were most likely originally from Java. The original Cham political capital was Tra Kieu, the commercial capital was Hoi An and the spiritual capital was My Son (Hindu). The Cham people were Hindu, and by the 10th century the influence of Arab traders to Hoi An resulted in the conversion of some to Islam.\n\nThe second major influence was Chinese, first by traders, then by escaping Ming Dynasty armies, who after settling in Hoi An for some years, moved further south and created Saigon as a major trading port.\n\nThe third and last major influence of culture and heritage was from the Vietnamese and is fairly recent and only came after the Cham lost control of this area. For a tourist wanting Vietnamese culture and heritage, Hue is a much better destination than Hoi An (but the weather is much rougher too!).\n\nWhile the serious shipping business has long since moved to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Da Nang"]]},", the heart of the city is still the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Old Town"]},", full of winding lanes and Chinese-styled shophouses, which is particularly atmospheric in the evening as the sun goes down. While almost all shops now cater to the tourist trade, the area has been largely preserved as is, which is unusual in Vietnam, and renovation has proceeded slowly and carefully. It's mercifully absent of towering concrete blocks and karaoke parlours.\n\nThe culture and heritage that UNESCO WHS status for Hoi An Old Town was trying to preserve is long since gone. Since 1999, when UNESCO status was awarded, there has been a massive increase in mass tourism, with the result that most houses have been sold to speculators and shop owners to be used for commercial purposes. The community and with it their culture and heritage is gone and in their place are shops, restaurants, art galleries, etc.  There are literally hundreds of tailor shops in Hoi An, all selling similar low value products to ever smaller numbers of Western tourists.\n\nUNESCO Biosphere Reserve status also applies to Hoi An Old Town, but in reality this status, like all other UNESCO designations, has not been accompanied by enlightened site management.\n\nThe main thoroughfare in the Old Town is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Tran Phu"]},". Just south of the Old Town, across the Thu Bon River, are the islands of ",{"type":"'''","value":["An Hoi"]}," to the west, reached via Hai Ba Trung, and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cam Nam"]}," to the east, reached via Hoang Dieu.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Note on November flooding "]},"\nHoi An regularly floods during the month of November. Visitors who plan to arrive during one of their floods would be advised to book ahead.\n\nThe city stayed open during the November 2013 floods, although there were news reports of tourist evacuations. As hotels near the river flooded, tourists started moving to hotels on higher ground. Flooding affected streets up to four blocks uphill from the river, as well as the hotel\/restaurant area across the bridge on An Hoi peninsula. The water levels for this flood seem slightly below the levels of the 2011 flood; the cleanup seemed to be well handled.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:DAD Check-in 2012 01.JPG"],["thumb"],["Da Nang International Airport"]]},"\n\nThe nearest airport is in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Da Nang"]]}," which has domestic connections to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hanoi"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ho Chi Minh City"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hue"]]}," and some international flights to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bangkok"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Singapore"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Siem Reap"]]}," (for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Angkor Wat"]]},"), and charter flights to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China"]]},".\n\nA taxi from Da Nang airport to Hoi An costs about US$22 using a taxi with a meter. This is one occasion where haggling to set a fixed price is cheaper than going by the meter. One traveller reports paying around 300,000 dong while the meter read over 400,000 dong. Air conditioned minibus taxis cost USD5 per person to the airport (there are no minibuses from the airport, you must first go to the city). The ride takes about 45 min.\n\n\nGenerally good practice in Vietnam is to call and book a taxi with Mai Linh Taxi as they are the most reliable and honest and pay the metered fee.\n\nA word of caution about flying Jetstar: they are frequently up to 8 hr late, many times arriving at Da Nang from Saigon at 02:00. If you arrive late, you should arrange an airport transfer in advance if you don't want the taxi haggling hassles.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Go Travel Vietnam"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/GoTravelVietnam\/info"],["email="],["address=61 Phan Chau Trinh St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=At the corner of Le Loi St"],["phone=+84 510 3929115"],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Offers transfers from Hoi An to Da Nang Airport and train station at 5 set times per day for 80,000 dong.

Taxis can be found in the middle of Le Loi St, over the river in An Hoi or summoned by phone. When busy, taxis may refuse your fare back to your hotel from town if it is too close, opting for larger fares. Arranging a shuttle from your hotel may be a better option although prices may be higher.\n\nMotorbike taxis, of course, are always an option. \n\nTraffic in Hoi An is minimal, so if you've been avoiding getting on a bike in the big cities, Hoi An and the surrounding countryside like is ideal to get used to the road rules.\n\nGet a car to visit ",{"type":"[[","value":[["My Son"]]}," early in the morning, about an hour away, or the Marble Mountains, about forty minutes north towards Da Nang.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bicycle"]},"\nPedal bicycles can be rented quickly and easily for as low as 20,000 dong per day, and is one of the best ways to get around town.

It's standard practice for a rental bike to have only enough fuel to make it to the next filling station (hopefully!)

In the event of an accident, foreigners driving a motorcycle without a valid licenceare considered to be at fault and therefore liable for damages and may face a citation. Check your travel insurance exclusions, as generally you will not be covered for accidents when riding a motorcycle here.

You can point and say \"yes\" or \"no\" to the vegetables and chilli that they will add. A good way to order is to just say \"everything\" and say \"yes\" to the chilli.
