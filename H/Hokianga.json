The entrance to the beautiful harbour is guarded by two headlands that legend tells are the taniwha who accompanied Kupe to this country. The North Head is called Niniwa and the South Head is Arai-te-Uru. The eleven rivers that feed the Hokianga are the paths their children made.\n\nThe population is 6,000–7,000 of whom 60% are of Maori descent, Te Rarawa iwi in the north, Ngapuhi iwi in the south. Many people are descendents of early European settlers as well as being able to trace their Maori ancestry back to Rahiri. \n\nThe remoteness of the Hokianga, combined with a lack of investment in the region, gave it a reputation as being one of the most poverty-stricken parts of the country. This neglect caused the area to remain pristine, unspoilt, untouched and untamed.\n\nThe climate is sub-tropical: bananas, figs and peaches grow wild. Horticulture is gradually making a come-back after years of neglect.\n\nThere are many arts-related activities from country and western music to film and book festivals, kapa haka and jazz. \n\nHokianga Health Enterprise Trust runs the hospital and the health system which includes district nurses in nine clinics, a dental service and other services such health promotion. The Trust is elected by the community and the doctors work for salaries.
