However, the ubquitous hotspring resorts in much of the island serve as a reminder that you are still in Japan.\n\nHokkaido is by far Japan's largest prefecture, consisting of Japan's entire northern island and its surrounding islets. Hokkaido is cooler than the rest of Japan, and the merciful lack of Japan's muggy summers and rainy season makes it a very popular domestic destination between May and August. Some of Hokkaido's inland areas have a continental climate, with large daily and yearly temperature variation.\n\nMost of Hokkaido was settled by the Japanese within the last 100 years, compared to the thousands of years of Japanese history and pre-history.

The main regional carriers are JAL subsidiary ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hokkaido Air Commuter"]}," and ANA subsidiary ",{"type":"'''","value":["Air Nippon"]}," (now operating in its parent's livery).

This is especially so when visiting some of the national parks or onsen resorts. However, visitors not used to driving in snow should be careful in the winter, and note that speed limits are reduced significantly (only about 80km\/h) in winter when the expressways are covered in snow.

This shouldn't be more than ¥500 or so.\n\nIf you are coming for the mountains, be sure to stay in one of the many mountain huts (山小屋 ",{"type":"''","value":[" yamagoya"]},") in Hokkaido.

It's not unusual to see cars traveling at over 100 km\/h on regular highways (the posted limit is 60 km\/h). Head-on collisions at these speeds, especially with minicars, are catastrophic.\n\nHokkaido has many country farm roads which are narrow, poorly marked, and arrow-straight. These often run parallel to highways and tend to be much less crowded. It's not unusual for locals to exceed 100 km\/h on these roads. Missing a stop sign can be fatal, and signs may be hard to spot. Be careful of farm vehicles backing out of sheds with no warning, and especially careful of bicycles in the summer, as there are no shoulders.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Winter driving"]}," in Hokkaido is not for the faint of heart. Very little sand or salt is used on the roads, and the heavy snow in many areas means that the roadways turn into packed snow, then solid ice. This also means that the road markings will be totally invisible. Look for overhanging center line (中央線 ",{"type":"''","value":["chūosen"]},") signs above the roads at intersections. Highways have arrow signs pointing downward at the shoulders of the road, which will also be invisible. Winter tires are mandatory. Chains are recommended for mountain driving. Because speeds are lower, there are less fatalities, but there are more accidents in the winter. If you have never driven in the winter, do not attempt to learn here.\n\nThe Hokkaido fox carries the ",{"type":"'''","value":["echinococcus parasite"]},", which can be fatal in humans. Because this parasite can be spread through water, do not drink any unboiled river or lake water in Hokkaido. Approaching or feeding foxes is also not recommended.
