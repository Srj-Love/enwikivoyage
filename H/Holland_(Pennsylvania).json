Regularly scheduled train service lasted until January 14, 1983 via SEPTA's Fox Chase Transit Line. The station, and all of those north of Fox Chase, were closed due to failing diesel train equipment that the SEPTA could not afford to fix. As a result, passenger numbers were low and the service cancelled on a temporary basis. As such, Holland Station still appears in SEPTA's publicly posted tariffs. Although rail service was initially replaced with a Fox Chase-Newtown shuttle bus, the number of riders remained low. The traveling public never saw a bus service as a good replacement for a rail service, and the Fox Chase-Newtown shuttle bus service ended in 1999.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nI-95 N\n23.0 mi\n2. 39 mins\nI-95 N and PA-213 S\/E Maple Ave\n29.2 mi\n\nFrom Philadelphia, PA\n1.
