Tickets to Leeds, Dewsbury and Manchester can be bought straight from the driver, and timetables are generally coordinated to connect to the most popular rail routes from Huddersfield.\n\nAs of December 2007, the \"Holmfirth Connection\" will be using a revised route network, with lines 309-311 replaced by a limited stop X10 service from Huddersfield, and the 313 rerouted for more direct services to and from Holmfirth.\n\nOnce you are in Holmfirth. there's a local minibus service that provides journeys to various villages dotted about the valley.

The Pennines can be seen in the distance and the road carries on into Derbyshire, past Ladybower reservoir and the town of Glossop and leads eventually into Stockport and Manchester.\nThere are a number of villages that surround Holmfirth, including Upperthong, Netherthong, and Hepworth. It is great just to stroll round these villages which have changed little over the last 100 years. Hepworth in particular has some lovely walks and is on the Kirklees Way. The village hall in Hepworth shows a vibrant community with activities going on most days. Look at the Hepworth website for more information.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["53.570"],["-1.787"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["West Yorkshire"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Holmfirth"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Europe\/United Kingdom\/England\/West Yorkshire\/Holmfirth\/"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Holmfirth"]]}]
