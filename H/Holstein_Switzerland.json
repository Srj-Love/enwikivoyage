Much of it occupies the districts of Ostholstein and Plön, between the North German coastal cities of Lübeck and Kiel and extending north to the Baltic coast. The region's charm is its constantly-changing landscape within the Schleswig-Holstein Uplands. Woods and copses alternate with hedges, fields and broad blue lakes nestling amongst low hills. The larger lakes include Lake Plön, the Dieksee and Kellersee. Its major watercourse is the River Schwentine, which flows into Kiel Fjord. The Bungsberg (168 m) is the highest hill in the region and has the only ski lift in Schleswig-Holstein.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Towns "]},"\t\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bad Malente"]]},"-Gremsmühlen\t"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Eutin"]]},"\t"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lütjenburg"]]},"\t"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oldenburg in Holstein"]]},"\t"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Plön"]]},"\t"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Preetz"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Ploenerschloss0206.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Plön Castle from Lake Plön"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Plön Castle.
