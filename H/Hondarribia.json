As a town historically on the border, whether between Navarre and Castille, or between Spain and France, Hondarribia has enjoyed a tumultuous past.\nAfter citizens sought protection under the Castilian crown in 1203, Hondarribia became a point of conflict between Castille and the kingdom of Navarre, supported by France. The town was repeatedly besieged by French and Navarran forces throughout the 1300s up until the Thirty Years' War in the mid 1600s, when Spain and France reconciled their borders under the Treaty of the Pyrenees. After the signing of this treaty (which fixed the French border to its current state), Hondarribia remained a border town, across the Bay from France.\n\nThere are two sections of town that are of special interest to the traveler:\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Calle Mayor Iglesia.jpg"],["200px"],["right"],["thumb"],["The main street of Hondarribia, with the Casadevante Palace and the Church"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["The old city"]}," — With its medieval walls still intact, the historic part of town is home to the castle of Charles V, Zuloaga Palace, Casadevante Palace, the gothic church of ",{"type":"''","value":["Nuestra Señora del Manzano"]},", and Calle Pampinot, among other sights."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["La Marina"]}," — full of multicolored houses and their resident fishermen, along San Pedro and Santiago Streets."]},"\nHondarribia's beach, ports, lighthouse, the beach of Ondarraitz (on the other side of the bay), and the neighboring hillsides are just as attractive, and make it clear why Hondarribia has enjoyed its position as a vacation destination for more than 100 years.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nHondarribia is across the river from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hendaye"]]},", 4 km from Irún, 15 km from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Sebastian"]]},", and 20 km from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Biarritz"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["France"]]},".
