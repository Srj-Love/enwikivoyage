Today, the former British colony is a major tourism destination for China's increasingly affluent mainland population.

The traveller weary of its crowded streets may be tempted to describe it as ",{"type":"''","value":["Hong Kongcrete"]},". Yet, this territory with its cloudy mountains and rocky islands is mostly a rural landscape. Much of the countryside is classified as Country Park and, although 7 million people are never far away, it is possible to find pockets of wilderness that will reward the more intrepid tourist.\n\nHong Kong has a subtropical climate with at least one season to match your comfort zone. Boasting one of the world's best airports, it is the ideal stopover for those who wish to travel deeper into Asia.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nWhile part of the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong operates as a Special Administrative Region with a high degree of autonomy, and so for most visitors it is effectively a different country. Visa requirements, laws, currency, culture and language are different from the rest of China.  Since the handover from the British in 1997, Hong Kong has operated under a \"One Country, Two Systems\" principle, maintaining most laws and government structures from colonial times. Hong Kong enjoys many Western-style freedoms unheard of on the Chinese mainland, and many locals are proud of it. The ideals of a free and open society are firmly rooted here.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Orientation"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Hong Kong Island"]}," (香港島) gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists regard as the main focus. The parade of buildings that make the Hong Kong skyline has been likened to a glittering bar chart that is made apparent by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour. To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon waterfront opposite.\n\nThe great majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern shore. This is the place the British colonisers took as their own and so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start. Victoria was once the colony's capital but has been rebranded with a more descriptive name, ",{"type":"'''","value":["Central"]},". Here you will find the machinery of government grinding away much as it always has done, except that Beijing, not London, is the boss that keeps a watchful eye. Seek a glimpse of government house (香港禮賓府) which was formerly home to 25 British governors and is now the residence of the Chief Executive CY Leung. Nearby, the Legislative Council (LegCo) continues to make the laws that organise the territory.\n\nRising up from Central is the Escalator and the Peak Tram. The famous 800 metre escalator passes through the hip district of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Soho"]}," and takes you into the residential neighbourhood known as the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mid-Levels"]}," because it is half-way up the mountain. Up top is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Victoria Peak"]},", known locally as ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Peak"]},", the tallest point on the island where foreign diplomats and business tycoons compete for the best views of the harbour from some of the most expensive homes to be found anywhere. Most tourists do not go much further than the Peak Tram, but take a short walk to the top and you will escape the crowds and be rewarded with some of the best harbour views. It is worth investing in a good map from leading bookshops in Central if you want to enjoy some of the superb footpaths that crisscross the island.\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["southern side"]}," of the island has developed into an upmarket residential area with many large houses and expensive apartments with views across the South China Sea. The island's best beaches, such as Repulse Bay, are found here and visitors can enjoy a more relaxed pace of life than on the bustling harbour side of the island.  Wan Chai and Causeway Bay are the most visited neighbourhoods on the ",{"type":"'''","value":["northern side"]}," of the island.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Kowloon"]]}]}," (九龍) is the peninsula to the north of Hong Kong Island.

Often ignored by travellers who have little time to spare, the New Territories offers a diverse landscape that takes time to get to know. Mountainous country parks overlook New Towns that have a clinical form of modernity that has attracted many to move here from mainland China. Public transport and taxis make this area surprisingly accessible if you dare to get out and explore this offbeat place. You will not find many idyllic villages, but once you get over the stray dogs and the ramshackle buildings you will doubtlessly find something that will surprise you and cause you to reach for your camera.\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Outlying Islands"]}," (離島) are the generic label for the islands, islets and rocks in the seas around the territory which is made up of a total of 236 islands.

Other islands include ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lamma"]]}," (南丫島), well known for its seafood, and Cheung Chau (長洲), a small island that used to be a pirates' den, but now attracts seafood aficionados, windsurfers and sunbathing day trippers.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nArchaeological findings date the first human settlements in the area back to more than 30,000 years ago. It was first incorporated into China during the Qin Dynasty and largely remained under Chinese rule until 1841 during the Qing Dynasty, with a brief interruption at the end of the Qin Dynasty, when a Qin official established the kingdom of Nam Yuet, which later fell to the Han Dynasty.\n\nHong Kong Island became a British colony in January 1841, as a result of the defeat of the Qing Dynasty of China in the First Opium War. After the defeat of China in the Second Opium War, the Kowloon Peninsula was then ceded to Great Britain in 1860. The New Territories were subsequently leased in 1898 to Great Britain for a term of 99 years.\n\nWhen World War II broke out, the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill declared that Hong Kong was an \"impregnable fortress\". However owing to Britain's main war effort in Europe, Hong Kong was not given sufficient resources for its defense. As a result, after just slightly more than two weeks of fighting, Hong Kong was surrendered to the Japanese on 25 December 1941 and occupation lasted until the end of the war. Upon the resumption of British control all restrictions on non-Europeans owning property on prime real estate land were lifted followed by an astonishingly swift post war recovery.\n\nAfter the communists took control of mainland China in 1949, many Chinese people, especially businessmen, fled to Hong Kong due to persecution by the communist government. Unlike the restrictive policies imposed by the communists in China, the British government took a rather hands off approach in Hong Kong, as proposed by former financial secretary John James Cowperthwaite, which led to a high degree of economic freedom. Under such conditions, businesses flourished in Hong Kong and its economy grew rapidly, earning it a place as one of the East Asian Tigers. Today, Hong Kong is considered to be an industrialised and developed economy, and is one of the world's most important financial centres, along with the likes of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New York City"],["New York"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:City Boundary 1903 - Old Peak Road.jpg"],["thumb"],["Boundary Stone along the Victoria City Boundary at Old Peak Road"]]},"\n\nThe massive influx of mainland Chinese refugees led to the rise of the Kowloon Walled City, which was a horrendous convolution of maze-like alleys, utter darkness, cramped space, and unsanitary conditions. There was no effective police presence inside the city itself, and it was full of triad gangs, prostitution and unlicensed physicians practising there. The Walled City was demolished in 1993, and the Kowloon Walled City Park was built on the site.\n\nIn 1984 the Chinese and British Governments signed the Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong, agreeing to return Hong Kong back to China sovereignty on 1 July 1997. Hong Kong became a special administrative region (SAR) of the Peoples Republic of China.\n\nIn accordance with the Joint Declaration, the Basic Law was enacted to serve in effect as a mini-constitution for the Hong Kong SAR. In theory, Hong Kong enjoys a high degree of autonomy in most matters except foreign affairs and defence. In practice Beijing exerts much influence in the background, however citizens are nevertheless free to keep pushing for a more democratic regime and universal suffrage.\n\nHong Kong mostly operates like a tiny country with its own currency, laws, international dialling code, police force, border controls and the like. It is also a member of international organisations that are normally restricted to sovereign states such as the WTO, APEC and the IOC. The Hong Kong flag is prominently flown throughout the territory, often alongside that of the Chinese mother country.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["People"]},"\nThe majority of Hong Kong's population are Han Chinese (95%), mostly of Cantonese ancestry, though there are also sizeable numbers of other Chinese groups such as Chiuchao (Teochews), Shanghainese and Hakkas. A significant number of Indian, Pakistani and Nepalese live here too, and many have families that have lived in Hong Kong for several generations.\n\nThe largest groups of recent, non-Chinese immigrants are Filipinos, Indonesians and Thais, of which most are employed as domestic helpers. On Sundays, being the free day of these domestic workers, they congregate in their thousands - mostly Filipinas - in Central and Admiralty and spend the day there together, sitting talking, eating and drinking wherever there is free room. Lately whole streets have been blocked off for them.\n\nThe territory is also home to a significant number of people hailing from Australia, Europe, Japan and North America, making it a truly international metropolis. \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Hong Kong Skyline Restitch - Dec 2007.jpg"],["thumb"],["upright=1.8"],["Hong Kong skyline at night"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Culture"]},"\nDue to its history as part of that region, the local culture in Hong Kong is similar to that of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guangdong"]]}," province. However, due to over a century of British rule, the British have also left their mark on the local culture. In addition, due to its evasion of communist ideologies when the Cultural Revolution was taking place in the mainland, Hong Kongers have maintained many aspects of traditional Chinese culture which have largely disappeared in the mainland. In general, Hong Kongers have a somewhat paradoxical identity, regarding themselves as culturally and ethnically Chinese, but at the same time considering themselves distinct from the mainland Chinese.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nHong Kong has a humid subtropical climate. Summers are usually hot, lasting from June to September, with temperatures usually exceeding 30°C, while night-time summer temperatures do not drop below 25°C . The area, with most of southern China, is affected by typhoons. Typhoons usually occur between June and September, though some typhoons may affect Hong Kong as late as October. These can bring a halt to local business for a day or less (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong#Natural disasters"],["natural disaster"]]},").\n\nWinters in Hong Kong are generally very mild, with temperatures ranging from 10°C to 20°C, although dropping further sometimes, especially in the countryside. Christmas in Hong Kong is considered warm compared to many Western countries. Chinese New Year is notorious for cold wet weather, because winter in Hong Kong tends to start out mild and dry and then turn cooler and wetter later.\n\nSpring starts in Hong Kong from March to May and autumn starts from September to November with an average temperature of around 20 to 25°C. Autumn is considered a more comfortable season as spring tends to be more humid and rainy.\n\nAlthough most buildings in Hong Kong have air-conditioning to cope with the summer weather, winter heating is something of a novelty.  During the coldest days, most locals simply wear more layers, even indoors. In a restaurant, for example, it is not unusual to see customers eating with jackets and scarves on. Furthermore, some larger Chinese restaurants keep the air-conditioning on during winter, though the temperature in air conditioned shopping malls stays the same regardless of season or weather outside.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Books"]},"\nIts quick rise as an economic power and unique mix of East and West has made Hong Kong an interesting destination to write about.

Those who are familiar with Singapore's eZ-Link card, London Underground's Oyster card, Washington DC's SmarTrip card, Melbourne's myki card or Japan Railway's IC cards will quickly understand how to use the Octopus card. In addition to being used for all forms of public transport (except most of the red-top minibuses and taxis), Octopus is also accepted for payment in almost all convenience stores like 7-Eleven, restaurant chains like McDonald's, Maxim's, and Cafe de Coral, many vending machines, all roadside parking and some car parks. Some housing estates and schools use the card for identification at entry. The Octopus card functionality can also come in the form of personalised cards, ornaments, keychains and watches which you can pre-order at ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.octopus.com.hk\/home\/en\/index.html octopuscards.com"]}," if you are interested.\n\nWhen travelling by MTR and some bus routes, payment by Octopus card is often cheaper than cash because carriers frequently offer discounts to Octopus users (such as the route between the airport and the city). There is no reason to get one if you are in Hong Kong for a short time and don't go there frequently, however, if your itinerary includes daily use of ferries, buses, minibuses and the MTR then you will want to have one.\n\nBasic Octopus cards cost $150, with $100 face value plus $50 refundable deposit. A $9 service charge applies if the card is returned in less than three months for the refundable deposit. The maximum value an Octopus card can carry is $1,000. The Octopus card also allows its remaining value to go negative once before topping up. For example, you may pay for a ride of $5 with a remaining value of $2 on the card (bringing the stored value to -$3) but you cannot use the card again until the value is topped up. The negative value of an Octopus card can go as far as $35.  Note that isn't really \"negative\", meaning you don't have to pay MTR back, since your $50 deposit secures it.\n\nThe Central to Mid-Levels escalator, at 800m long, is the longest outdoor covered escalator system in the world. The escalator runs downhill 06:00-10:00 and uphill 10:30-23:59 every day. When travelling downhill on the escalator, there is a machine where you can touch your Octopus card, and your next MTR journey will have a $2 discount (if it starts at Central\/Hong Kong or Sheung Wan station and if you don't take any other transport before then). These are called \"MTR Fare Saver\" machines and can be found at http:\/\/www.mtr.com.hk\/eng\/whatsnew\/fare_saver.html.\n\nYour Octopus card's balance is displayed on the reader after each use.

While 'subway' is understood as well, in Hong Kong it actually refers to underground walkways (due to British influence), rather than the metro system.\n\nFares depend on distance.

During public holidays and other similar occasions the Peak Tram is likely to have very long queues of people waiting to board.  Note that the tram is not the only way to get to the Peak, and there are cheaper (but slower and less scenic) alternatives such as the number 1 (green minibus) & number 15 (double-decker bus) that cost $8.4 and $9.8, respectively, from Exchange Square Bus Terminus.\n\nThere is also a tram system located at the Western side of the territory called ",{"type":"'''","value":["Light Rail"]},", operated by the MTR Corporation. It is a modern and fast tram system connecting Tuen Mun, Yuen Long and Tin Shui Wai. It is also known as ",{"type":"''","value":["ding ding"]}," by local people. It has an open fare system, in which passengers are required to buy a ticket or tap an Octopus card at the entrance before boarding, and ticket inspection is randomly done to ensure it is done.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:NWFB Hennessy Road.jpg"],["thumb"],["A typical New World First Bus, a Double Decker type Bus."]]},"\n\nThere are three types of bus available in Hong Kong, operated by a multitude of companies. While generally easy to use (especially with Octopus), signage in English can be sparse and finding your bus stop can get difficult. Buses are pretty much your only option for travelling around the south side of the island and Lantau.\n\nThe frequency of bus services however mean that it can also be the fastest way around as long as you master them correctly. Google Maps will actually let you know the best number bus to take from your current position to destination.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The large ",{"type":"'''","value":["double-decker buses"]}," cover practically all of the territory, stop frequently and charge varying fares depending on the distance.

Route and fare information can be found on the companies web sites. Alternatively it's also wise to install transportation apps such as  \"KMB & LW\" and \"CitybusNWFB\" into your smartphone, to check fares outdoors if you'll use mobile devices regularly during your stay."]},"\nFares will depend more on where you board rather than where you get-off (except for the cross-boundary route B2 and a few overnight buses) which means it is more expensive to board at the earlier stops rather than the later stops. Hence, bus rides which cross the harbour between Kowloon and the Island exceed $9 prior to the crossing.  The fare is displayed on a digital display above the farebox - exact change, Octopus Card or a ticket purchased from a bus travel centre (only applicable to a few routes found at major transit hubs such as Star Ferry or Central Bus Terminus) must be used.  There are plenty of bus routes that provide a fare discount for transferring with a particular set of routes; they're often confusing for visitors, however instructions are written on bus stop timetable leaflets. There are also some bus routes (especially the routes going to Stanley) which offer discount if a passenger gets off early and taps the Octopus card again prior to alighting.\n\nUnlike mainland China, there are announcements in Cantonese, Mandarin and English except for most buses on New Lantau Bus. Buses will only stop when requested (except at the terminus) - when your bus approaches, raise your arm to hail the bus (like you would hail a taxi), and when alighting, press the buzzer (located by the exit doors and on the grab-rails) to signal to the driver that you want to alight. Always board at the front and alight from the centre door - unless the bus has only one door, or on the routes where you need to pay when alighting, in which case keep to the left.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Van-sized ",{"type":"'''","value":["public light buses"]}," carry a maximum of 16 passengers (seats only) and come in two varieties, ",{"type":"'''","value":["red minibuses"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["green minibuses"]}," (the red buses are also called ",{"type":"'''","value":["maxicabs"]},"); the colour refers to a wide stripe painted on top of the vehicle. Riding a minibus may not be easy for travellers, as it is required to call out the name of the stop or ask the driver to stop in Cantonese. (Just shouting 'Please Stop' loudly in English usually suffices) More and more red minibuses accept Octopus card, but still many do not accept Octopus but will give you change, while green minibuses do accept Octopus payment but cannot give you change if you pay in cash. The Hong Kong Island green minibus #1 down from the Peak to Central is particularly exhilarating. Red minibuses tend to have a more Chinese feel than green buses. Prices on red minibuses are often displayed only in Chinese numbers. The price displayed on a red minibus can legally vary according to the market price, so expect to pay more at busy times. Some people argue that the driving standards of red minibuses are lower than green minibuses; Minibus drivers generally drive fast, especially at night. Always use minibus seatbelts where available. You will notice that they all have an extra, large, digital speedometer in the cabin for the passengers to view, this is required by the government after a few fatal accidents due to speeding. Since the introduction of these passenger speedometers mini-bus accident rates have dropped."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The MTR also maintains a fleet of feeder buses.

Paying by Octopus is much more convenient. The exception to this rule is if you use a red minibus; Octopus cards are not accepted on red minibus services, but they do give you change.\n\nThere are six independent route numbering systems, applying to: buses (i) on Hong Kong Island, (ii) in Kowloon and the New Territories, and (iii) on Lantau Island; green minibuses (iv) on Hong Kong Island, (v) in Kowloon, and (vi) in New Territories and several exceptional auxiliary bus routes. Red minibuses do not usually have a route number. This leads to duplication of routes in different regions. Although the Transport Department has been working on unification of the route numbers, they are still a little bit messy at the moment. If you are confused a bit by the numbering of routes, here is a suggestion: just remember the route number of buses in Hong Kong Island\/Kowloon\/New Territories only whenever it is necessary. In other special circumstances, ask the driver or the station staff for the Lantau buses and green minibuses and they can answer you.\n\nGenerally you need not mention which district the route belongs to when you are asking for directions (almost all people will assume you are asking for the route which runs in the district you are in, e.g. if you ask for bus route #2, locals will assume you are asking for bus route #2 running in Kowloon if you are in Kowloon), but you really need to mention whether the route is by bus or minibus when you ask, since in some cases both buses and minibuses can have the same route number in the same area which are actually different routes. (e.g. there are both bus route #6 and minibus route #6 in Tsim Sha Tsui, which are actually different routes).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By ferry"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:StarFerry IslandSkyline.JPG"],["thumb"],["Star Ferry and the Island skyline"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Star Ferry crew using billhook to catch rope at Central ferry pier, Hong Kong.jpg"],["thumb"],["Crew using billhook to catch mooring rope."]]},"\nA vast fleet of ferries plies between the many islands of Hong Kong. The granddaddy of them all and an attraction in itself is the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.starferry.com.hk Star Ferry"]}]},", whose most popular line travels between Tsim Sha Tsui and Central from early morning until late at night, and offers amazing views (especially when coming from Tsim Sha Tsui).  The Star Ferry is an icon of Hong Kong heritage and has carried passengers for over 120 years. Taking its 11-minute ride across the harbour and catching some misty breeze is considered a \"must do\" when visiting Hong Kong. Navigation enthusiasts will also not want to miss the sight of the crew using a billhook to catch the thrown rope as it moors at the pier, a practice unchanged since the first ferry ran in 1888.\n\nUpper deck seats cost $2.50 on weekdays and $3.40 on weekends while the lower deck cost $2.00 on weekdays and $2.80 on weekends, both payable with Octopus, cash (no change given) or by onsite vending machine. The Star Ferry also operates between Tsim Sha Tsui and Wanchai but only offers upper-deck seating.  A 4-day tourist ticket is also available for $25.\n\nFerries to Lamma, Lantau and other islands depart from a variety of ports, but the largest and most important terminal is at Central adjacent to the Star Ferry. Ferries are usually divided into ",{"type":"'''","value":["fast ferries"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["slow ferries"]},", with fast ferries charging around twice the price for half the journey time, although not all destinations offer both kinds of service. Example fares for trips from Central to Yung Shue Wan (Lamma) are $10\/15 slow\/fast, and to Mui Wo (Lantau) $10.50\/$21. Note that all fares increase by around 50% on Sundays and public holidays.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Kowloon Waterfront, Hong Kong, 2013-08-09, DD 05.jpg"],["thumb"],["Red taxis in Kowloon"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Taxis"]}," are plentiful, clean and efficient. They are quite cheap compared to many other large cities.\n\nThere are three types of taxis in Hong Kong, easily identified by their colours: red, green and blue, all of which serve the airport and Hong Kong Disneyland.\n\nThe Urban (red) taxis can travel most destinations in Hong Kong and are also the most expensive. The meter starts at $22.00 for the first 2 kilometres, and a further $1.60 for every 200m thereafter, and $1.00 each ticking when the fare goes above $78. Note that on Lantau island they are only permitted to go to the airport, Tung Chung and Disneyland.\n\nNT (green) taxis are slightly cheaper than the red ones but are fundamentally confined to rural areas in the New Territories, the airport, and Hong Kong Disneyland.\n\nLantau (blue) taxis (the cheapest of the three) operate only on Lantau Island (including the airport and Hong Kong Disneyland).\n\nThe airport will have taxis with all three colours, however both signs and attendants will make it easy for you to make the right choice.\n\nBy law, Hong Kong taxis must take you to your destination however in practice they tend to ignore this rule if it isn't convenient to them. However unless it is raining extremely hard, then there will be no issue finding another taxi close by to take you.\n\nThe wearing of seat belts is required by law, the driver has the right to refuse to carry the passenger if they fail to comply. In practice this is rarely observed.\n\nTipping for taxi rides is usually not required or expected. Drivers are required to provide change for $100 notes, but not for higher denominations. If you only have a $500 or $1,000 note and are going through a tunnel, let the driver know beforehand and he will change it when paying at the toll booth. Some taxis accept credit cards and Octopus cards to avoid hassles with small change although these are still very rare.\n\nThere are no extra late-night charges nor peak-hour surcharges.  However baggage carried in the boot (\"trunk\" in American and Canadian English) will cost you $5 per piece, except for wheelchairs.  No charges are levied for travel to\/from the airport or within downtown but all toll charges for tunnels are added to the bill.  The driver will normally pay on your behalf at the toll booth and you just need to reimburse him before alighting.\n\nBe aware that crossing the harbour is considered a relatively significant trip, and some taxi drivers may be reluctant to take you. To do this you can stand at a cross-harbour taxi rank (",{"type":"''","value":["there are not many"]},"), by hailing a taxi by making an arm movement like an ocean wave (",{"type":"''","value":["They will not stop if they don't want to go"]},") or just asking your hotel to call a taxi firm with your destination. Harbour crossing passengers are expected to pay the tolls (add around $70 for your trip).\n\nAll taxi drivers are required to display inside the vehicle an official name card that includes the driver's photograph and the license plate number. Unless a taxi has an out of service sign displayed, they are legally required to take you to your destination. They are also required to provide you a receipt upon request. If you think you have been \"toured\" around the city, or if they refuse to either carry you to your destination or provide for a receipt, you may file a complain to the Transport Complaints Unit Complaint Hotline (Voice mail service after office hours) at 2889-9999.\n\nAll taxis are equipped with mobile phones and can be reserved and requested via an operator for a token fee of $5, payable to the driver. You are unlikely to need to call a taxi, though, as they are plentiful. Only during Friday night rush hour in central you might find long lines on taxi stands.\n\nIt is good practice to get a local person to write the name or address of your destination in Chinese for you to hand to the taxi driver, as many drivers speak limited English and Mandarin. For example, if you wish to take a journey back to your hotel, ask a receptionist for the hotel's business card. It also helps if you have the phone number of your destination, you can give it to the driver to call there and ask for directions. Nevertheless, even if you don't take these steps, most taxi drivers know enough English to communicate the basics. Be aware that buildings might have an English name used by foreigners and a different English name used by locals. The HSBC building in Central is called \"Hong Kong Bank\" by taxi drivers for example.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Renting a car"]}," is largely unheard of in densely populated Hong Kong. With heavy traffic, a complex road network, as well as rare and expensive parking spaces and well-connected public transportation, renting a car is very unappealing. If you must, expect to pay over $600\/day even for a small car. Hong Kong allows foreigners to drive with an International Driving Permit (IDP), and if you possess a driving licence written in English then you can also drive in Hong Kong for a limited period of time. Anyone who drives for more than 12 months is required to get a Hong Kong license issued by the Department of Transportation.\n\nNevertheless, although public buses do exist throughout the SAR it does tend to be less reliable in some of the more remote areas in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Territories"]]},". Therefore, driving should certainly not be dismissed out of hand, especially if you intend to spend a significant amount of time hiking and camping in the countryside.\n\nHong Kong follows traffic rules and signage similar to the United Kingdom. The majority of Hongkongers will exceed the speed limit by around 10 km\/h which is the tolerated threshold. Drivers will sometimes not yield to pedestrians at crossings without traffic lights, although traffic lights are always observed. Wearing a seatbelt is mandatory for every passenger who has a seatbelt provided. Rush hour traffic can be severe around the Cross Harbour Tunnel which is generally congested 08:00-11:00 and 16:00-22:00 and even sometimes up till midnight. Many drivers will often not use their indicators when changing lanes. Roads in Hong Kong are generally well maintained.\n\nTraffic rules are enforced seriously and the penalty for breaking rules can be severe. Signs are written in both Chinese and English. Unlike mainland China, traffic in Hong Kong moves on the left, a part of its British legacy.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["Driving across the border"],["It is unlikely that you will be able to drive across the border to mainland China. If you wish to drive into mainland China then your vehicle must have a second set of number plates issued by the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guangdong"]]}," authorities. These are issued in limited numbers to people investing in the mainland, and the price for a second hand plate can be as high as HKD $300,000. You will also need to acquire a mainland Chinese driving licence. Hong Kong, Macau or foreign licences will not be accepted. You will also need to change sides of the road at the border."]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bicycle"]},"\nHong Kong has experienced a boom on biking in recent years. While many people still don't see bicycles as a safe and feasible substitute for public transportation due to the heavy traffic, fast speed of vehicles, steep hills, narrow streets and an absence of bicycle lanes, biking is getting more popular. A network of tarmac cycle tracks sprawl across the New Territories making it relatively easy to bike for longer distances.\n\nThere are also several mountain-bike trails in the Country Parks, although a permit is necessary to bring your bicycle into the parks. Visitors should comply with the Road User's Guide which is based on the United Kingdom Highway Code. If you plan to use busy urban roads you should be fit enough to keep up with the traffic, which moves surprisingly quickly.\n\nBike rental is available in several locations across the territory. Popular rental spots include Cheung Chau, Mui Wo (Lantau), Sha Tin, Tai Po Market, Tuen Mun and Ma On Shan. Rental fees are typically $20–30 a day for a standard entry-level mountain bike, or around $150 per day for a higher-spec mountain or road bike.\n\nIn general, although cycling is possible, Hong Kong is not a bicycle-friendly place because of its hilly landscapes, government policies, air pollution and a general lack of consideration by many motorists. Locals sometimes cycle on the pavements if they are not crowded, although most of time, pavements are too crowded even for pushing your bike.\n\nBasic rules to follow:\n# Cyclists are not allowed by law to ride on highways and tunnels, which are well patrolled. \n# It is an offence to be drunk in charge of a bicycle.\n# By law, you're required to have a front and rear light. \n# Electronic bike conversion systems are not allowed. The police have a strict enforcement policy on this offence.\n# The maximum penalty for riding on pedestrian roads is $500 or a three month jail sentence. Usually offenders get a warning, but the Hong Kong Police do occasionally have an annual, or bi-annual crackdown.\n# For folding bike users, sometimes a bus driver will tell you that it's not allowed, but if you talk to them nicely they will usually let you board.

Like all Chinese languages, Cantonese is a tonal language and definitely not easy for foreigners to master, but locals always appreciate any effort by visitors to speak it, so learning a few simple greetings will get you acquainted with locals much more easily.\n\nUnlike Hanyu Pinyin - standard romanization system for phoneticizing Mandarin, Cantonese so far hasn't developed a well recognised romanization system and local people seldom bother to learn them.

Education in English begins in kindergarten, and fluency in English is often a prerequisite for securing a good job. As a result, English is spoken fluently by most professionals and business people. In contrast, English proficiency tends to be more limited among the average working class person, particularly outside the main tourist areas. In addition, while many people can understand written English pretty well, they may not necessarily be comfortable speaking it. Nevertheless, most locals under the age of 40 (and many over that as well) know enough English for basic communication, while younger locals under the age of 30 often speak good English. To improve your chances of being understood, speak slowly, stick to basic words and sentences and avoid using slang.\n\nAs English is an official language of Hong Kong, government offices are required by law to have English-speaking staff on duty. There are two terrestrial English language TV stations: TVB Pearl and ATV World. English-language films in cinemas are almost always shown with the original soundtrack and Chinese subtitles, though children's films, especially animations, are often dubbed into Cantonese. British English is still widely used in Hong Kong, especially in government and legal documents. In the media, the South China Morning Post and both terrestrial TV channels use British English. Place names, such as Victoria Harbour (not Harbor) serve as a record of Hong Kong's colonial heritage.  Also, modern buildings, such as the International Finance Centre (not Center) maintain the tradition of using British spellings. Most secondary and tertiary institutions adopt English for instruction, even though in most cases lectures are conducted in Cantonese.\n\nIt is also important to note that many English street names are seldom used among local people including those who can speak fluent English. Before you go anywhere, ask hotel staff to write down the street names using Chinese characters.\n\nAlthough the majority of Hong Kong people are not fluent in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chinese phrasebook"],["Mandarin"]]},", they can usually understand it to some degree. Mandarin has been compulsory in all public schools since the handover, and with the huge influx of mainland tourists many people in the tourist industry will often speak Mandarin. Most shops in the main tourist areas as well as all government offices will have Mandarin-speaking staff on duty.\n\nAll official signs are bilingual in Chinese and English.

Spouses of employment visa holders can apply for a ",{"type":"'''","value":["dependent visa"]}," that has no limitations for working within Hong Kong, although it will terminate at the same time of the visa of the main holder.\n\nCitizens of the People's Republic of China also require an employment visa in order to work in Hong Kong. Spouses who are citizens of the People's Republic of China will also face issues in obtaining a dependent visa unless they have been living outside the People's Republic of China for more than one year.\n\nIn 2006, the Hong Kong Government introduced a new program called the Quality Migrant Application Scheme which targets highly skilled workers (",{"type":"''","value":["preferably university educated"]},") to come and settle in Hong Kong and seek employment.

In Chinese, one dollar is known formally as the ",{"type":"''","value":["yuen"]}," (圓) and colloquially as the ",{"type":"''","value":["men"]}," (蚊) in Cantonese. You can safely assume that the '$' sign used in the territory refers to HKD unless it includes other initials (e.g. US$ to stand for US dollar).  The HKD is also widely accepted in Macau in lieu of their home currency at a 1:1 rate.\n\nThe official exchange rate is fixed at HKD7.80 to USD1, although bank rates may fluctuate slightly. When exchanging currency at a big bank, be prepared to pay a small fixed commission, usually about $40 per transaction. If exchanging large amounts, this commission will have a negligible impact on the transaction. If exchanging small amounts, it may be advantageous to exchange at one of many independent exchange shops found in tourist areas. Although their exchange rates compared with big banks are slightly less favourable for you, most do not charge a commission. They may also be more convenient and a faster way to exchange (no queues, located in shopping centres, open 24 hours, etc.).  However, be wary of using independent exchangers outside banking hours because, without competition from big banks, their rates may become very uncompetitive.\n\nTry to avoid changing money at the airport or at most hotels since the rates offered there are usually extremely poor. Note that street money exchange vendors will often offer different rates and you may be able to save around 10% if you can compare several different places rather than using the first one you see. The worst rates will be similar to those found at the hotels.\n\nMany tourists opt to use their ATM debit cards instead of carrying cash or traveller's cheques.  Using this method, the exchange rates and fees are comparable to exchanging cash at big banks.  However, some smaller banks do not accept ATM cards from overseas customers.  The best banks for foreign tourists to use are HSBC, Hang Seng and Standard Chartered, and ATM machines from those banks are widespread.  Also, be mindful of withdrawal limits imposed by your bank.\n\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issues the new purple plastic $10 notes while the rest are issued by three banks (the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, also known as the 'Hong Kong bank', Standard Chartered Bank and Bank of China). The old green paper $10 notes issued by HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank remain legal tender. The design of the notes varies a lot between banks though the colour and size are about the same for notes of the same denomination. The larger the denomination, the larger the size of the banknotes. Banknotes come in denominations of:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" $10, green or purple (paper or plastic)."]},{"type":"*","value":[" $20, dark blue or light blue (old or new)."]},{"type":"*","value":[" $50, purple or green (old or new)."]},{"type":"*","value":[" $100, red."]},{"type":"*","value":[" $500, brown."]},{"type":"*","value":[" $1000, gold."]},"\nSome shops do not accept $1,000 notes due to counterfeiting concerns.\n\nThe coins come in units of\n",{"type":"*","value":[" $10, in bronze\/silver, circular."]},{"type":"*","value":[" $5, in silver, circular, thicker."]},{"type":"*","value":[" $2, in silver, wavey-circular."]},{"type":"*","value":[" $1, in silver, circular, thinner."]},{"type":"*","value":[" 50¢, in bronze, circular, larger."]},{"type":"*","value":[" 20¢, in bronze, wavey-circular."]},{"type":"*","value":[" 10¢, in bronze, circular, smaller."]},"\nvarying in a descending size (except $10 coin).\n\nSince September 1997, the use of the small coins and change has been reduced due to the innovation of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong#Octopus card"],["Octopus card"]]},". Originally used just for fare payment for the MTR and buses, it is now used all over the city, for purchases in any amount at convenience stores, fast food restaurants, pharmacies, vending machines, etc.\n\nAutomated Teller Machines (ATM's) are common in urban areas. They usually accept VISA, MasterCard, and to certain degree UnionPay. Maestro and Cirrus cards are widely accepted also. They dispense $100, $500 or rarely $1000 notes depending on the request. Credit card use is common in most shops for major purchases. Most retailers accept VISA and MasterCard, and some accept American Express as well. Maestro debit cards however are not widely accepted by retailers. Signs with the logo of different credit cards are usually displayed at the door to indicate which cards are accepted. For small purchases, in places such as McDonalds or 7-Eleven, cash or an Octopus Card is the norm though some of these outlets can accept credit cards for smaller purchases.  Sometimes, the merchant can give you a choice of whether to charge your credit card purchase directly to your home currency or Hong Kong dollars.  Choosing which currency to directly charge the purchase to won't matter for small amounts but for larger purchases it may be worth it to consult your credit card's policy on them converting foreign exchange transactions.\n\nMerchants will require that the credit cards be signed and will compare your signature with the card and do not ask for picture ID. The 'chip and pin' system for credit card authorisation is not used in Hong Kong.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Banking"]},"\nOpening a bank account in Hong Kong is a straightforward process, requiring a proof of address and a corresponding ID. A Hong Kong identification card (of any type) will make the process much easier, although foreign visitors are allowed to open bank accounts as well using their foreign address. Hong Kong banks will have English speaking staff available.\n\nSome banks can also provide accounts and UnionPay credit cards in the Chinese RMB currency, which can then be used when travelling in mainland China.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Costs"]},"\nHong Kong is expensive by Asian standards especially the cost of accommodation. A traveller on a bare bones budget can probably survive with $150 for a day if you are willing to stay in some of the cheapest accommodation in Hong Kong which could be as cheap as $60 per bed but the quality is not what everyone can tolerate.\n\nBackpackers with a less tight budget should expect to spend at least $150 for a bed and $500 for a room. Family travellers should expect to pay at least $1000 for accommodation per night.\n\nEating out in Hong Kong is generally cheaper than in Western countries, and prices start from about $20 per serve for a basic meal of porridge or noodles, although in mid-range restaurants, $150–200 per head is common. At the other end of the spectrum, fine dining can also be very expensive, and prices on the order of $1000 per head or more are not unheard of.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Tipping"]},"\nAs a general rule, tipping is ",{"type":"''","value":["not"]}," customary in Hong Kong, though people will not reject any tips you care to hand them. Tipping is a matter of personal choice, but visitors should take into account that locals usually do not leave a tip. Visitors should also know that it is common for bar and restaurant owners to keep some, or all, of the money given as tips.\n\nIn cheaper restaurants, tipping is not expected at all and it will be considered unusual not to take all your change. In medium-to-upmarket restaurants, a 10% service charge is often compulsorily added to your bill and this is usually regarded as the tip. You may wish to tip on top of the service charge for good service, but it is neither compulsory nor expected; to give it more chance of reaching the staff tips should be given in cash not as additions to a credit card bill. It is also common for midrange Chinese restaurants to give you peanuts, tea and towels and add a small charge to the bill. Known as \"cha-sui money\" (money for tea and water) it is considered to be common practice. So, unless the charge is excessive, tourists should accept it as part of the cost of the meal. Sometimes, restaurants will deliberately give customers change in coins, when notes should be given; it is your choice to either take all your change or leave a small tip.\n\nTipping is not expected in taxis but passengers will often round up the fare to the nearest dollar. During a typhoon, when any loss is not covered by insurance, a tip will be expected, or the taxi driver will ask you to pay a surcharge. In hotels, a guest is also expected to tip at least $10–20 for room service, and porters also expect $10–20 for carrying your bags. Bathroom attendants in luxury restaurants and clubs might also expect you to leave a few coins, but it's socially acceptable not to tip.\n\nExceptionally, on important occasions, such as a wedding party or similar big gala event, local people hosting such events do tip substantially more than ten percent of the total bill. The money is put into a red envelope and given to the manager.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Shop"]},"\nFierce competition, no sales tax and some wealthy consumers all add up to make Hong Kong an excellent destination for shopping. Choices are plentiful at competitive prices. Lookout for watches, camping equipment, digital items and special cosmetics.\n\nPopular shopping items include consumer electronics, custom clothing, shoes, camping equipment, jewellery, expensive brand name goods, Chinese antiques, toys and Chinese herbs\/medicine. There's also a wide choice of Japanese, Korean, American and European clothing and cosmetics but prices are generally higher than in their respective home countries.\n\nMost shops in Hong Kong's urban areas open at about 10AM until 10PM to midnight every day. High rental costs in Hong Kong, ranked second worldwide according to Forbes, makes it no surprise that the best bargain shops could be located anywhere except the ground floor. Shops recommended by local people may even be up on the 20th floor in a building that won't give you a hint that it's a place for shopping.\n\nMany shops will accept credit cards. In accepting credit cards, the merchant will look carefully at the signature rather than looking at photo ID. In addition, merchants will not accept credit cards with a different name to the person presenting it. All shops that accept credit cards and many that don't will also accept debit cards and ATM cards as payment. The term used for debit card payment is EPS.\n\nIn the old days, Hong Kong was a good place to buy cheap knockoff, fake products and pirated videos and software. Today, Hong Kong residents often buy these items in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shenzhen"]]}," just across the border in mainland China.\n\nBe careful when shopping at stores that have neon-lighted signs of famous brands. Some have complained about the products they purchased from these shops.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Antiques and Arts"]},"- Head for Hollywood Road and Loscar Road in Central.

The biggest local bookshop chain is the Commercial Press and they usually have a cheaper but limited English titles. For looking for Chinese books, local people's beloved bookshops are all along Sai Yeung Choi Street.

The basic rule is to avoid all the shops with flashing neon signs along Nathan Road and look for a shop with plenty of local, non-tourist, customers. Only use recommended shops, as shops such as those on Nathan Road are likely to disappear on your next visit to Hong Kong. For easy shopping, get an underground train to Mongkok and head to Sai Yeung Choi Street, where you might find some of the best deals. The Mong Kok Computer Centre and Galaxy Mall (Sing Jai) are always packed with local people. Several camera shops like Man-Sing and Yau-Sing are known for their impolite staff but have a reputation for selling at fair prices. In the 1990s and early 2000s, most shops didn't allow much bargaining, but this has changed since 2003 with the influx of tourists from mainland China. While it is hard to tell how much discount you should ask for, if a shop can give you more than 25-30% discount, local people tend to believe that it's too good to be true, unless it's a listed seasonal sale. While Hong Kong might offer favourable prices, it is always worth checking prices at Hong Kong based e-commerce such as DigitalRev or Expansys that might ship products to your hotel within a day or at least use their price to bargain with retailers.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Computers"]},"- The base price of computer equipment in Hong Kong is similar to that in other parts of the world, but there are substantial savings to be had from the lack of sales tax or VAT. The Wanchai Computer Centre, Mongkok Computer Centre and Golden Computer Arcade on Sham Shui Po are all a few steps away from their corresponding MTR stations.  Also electronic equipment is available at the large chain stores such as Broadway and Fortress which are located in the large malls.  The major chain stores will accept credit cards, while smaller shops will often insist on cash or payment by ATM card.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Computer Games and Gaming Hardware"]},"- If you are interested in buying a new PlayStation, Nindendo DS and the like, the Oriental Shopping Centre, 188 Wan Chai Road, is the place to go. Here you will definitely find a real bargain. Prices can be up to 50% cheaper than in your home country. Be careful to compare prices first. There are also a few game shops in the Wanchai Computer Centre. The back corners in the upper levels usually offer the best prices. You might even be lucky and find English speaking staff here. However, be careful to make sure that the region code of the hardware is compatible with your home country's region code (Hong Kong's region code is NTSC-J, different from mainland China) or buy region code free hardware (like the Nintendo DS lite).\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Music and Film"]},"- HMV is a tourist-friendly store that sells a wide range of more expensive products. For real bargains you should find your way into the smaller shopping centres where you will find small independent retailers selling CDs and DVDs at very good prices. Some shops sell good quality second hand products. Try the Oriental Shopping Centre on Wanchai Road for a range of shops and a taste of shopping in a more down-market shopping centre. Alternatively, brave the warren of CD and DVD shops inside the Sino Centre on Nathan Road between Mong Kok and Yau Ma Tei MTR stations. Hong Kong has two independent music stores. White Noise Records in Causeway Bay and  Harbour Records in TST. Hong Kong's leading department store Lane Crawford has CD Bars in its  IFC and Pacific Place stores and there's a good CD bar at Saffron Café on the Peak.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Camping and sports"]},"- A good place to buy sportswear is close to Mong Kok MTR station.

In addition to all the major international brands, there are also several local Hong Kong brands such as Giordano, Bossini, G2000, Joyce and Shanghai Tang. The International Finance Centre in Central has a good selection of ",{"type":"''","value":["haute coutre"]}," labels for the filthy rich, while for cheap knock-offs, Temple Street in Mong Kok is the obvious destination, though prices are not as cheap as they used to be and these days, most locals head across the border to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shenzhen"]]}," for cheaper bargains. There is also Citygate Outlets, an extremely large factory outlet mall containing most of the major foreign and local brands located near Tung Chung MTR station on Lantau Island. Tourist going to Ladies Market or any markets nearby should be aware that there are no price tags on items show. Most of the time, the price the merchant will quote you is double the price. Haggle with them and ask to reduce the price at least by 50%. In fact similar clothing items (lower price but fixed) can be found in brick and mortar shops nearby too (e.g. Sai Yeung Choi street)\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Tea"]},"- Buying good Chinese tea is like choosing a fine wine and there are many tea retailers that cater for the connoisseur who is prepared to pay high prices for some of China's best brews.

Marks & Spencer caters for homesick Brits by supplying traditional strong English tea bags at a reasonable price.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Watches and jewellery"]},"- Hong Kong people are avid watch buyers - how else can you show your wealth if you can't own a car and your home is hidden at the top of a tower-block? You will find a wide range of jewellery and watches for sale in all major shopping areas. If you are targeting elegant looking jewellery or watches try Chow Tai Fook, which can be expensive. Prices vary and you should always shop around and try and bargain on prices. When you are in Tsim Sha Tsui you will probably be offered a \"copy watch\" for sale.

For internationally branded items whose prices can be easily found (i.e. consumer electronics), discounts of 50% are extremely unlikely. However, deep discounts are often possible on merchandise such as clothes. However, if there is a shop that is selling goods with a 50% discount, most local people will likely avoid buying there because it's too good to be true.\n\nElectronics stores are often packed together in the same place, so it is often easy to spend a few minutes comparing prices, and to know the prevailing international prices. Start by asking for a 10 to 20% discount and see how they respond to you. Sometimes it maybe appropriate to ask \"is there any discount?\" or \"do I get any free gift?\".

Overcharging is seen as an immoral business practice by most local people, and is unlikely to spoil your holiday. Plenty of hotlines are available for complaints.\n\nIn areas crowded with tourists, traps do exist. They are often nameless consumer electronics stores with attention grabbing neon signs advertising reputable brand names. Many traps can be spotted if they have numerous employees in a very small store space. Often, several of these stores can be found in a row, especially along Nathan Road, in Kowloon and in parts of Causeway Bay.\n\nOne trick is to offer you a low price on an item, take your money only to 'discover' that it is out of stock, and then offer you an inferior item instead. Another trick is to give you a great price on a camera, take your credit card, and before handing over the camera convince you to buy another \"better one\" at an inflated cost. They may also try to mislead you into buying an inferior product, by claiming that it is a quality product.\n\nOne trick specially encountered in electronics shopping are missing items from the box, such as batteries, etc. Once you realize that an important item is missing and come back to the shop to get it, it will be offered at an inflated price. Reputable shops open the box that you will get in front of you and let you take a look to make sure everything is in there and even switch on the equipment before you pay.\n\nWatch out for persons (usually of Indian subcontinental descent) who approach tourists in the busier areas of Kowloon.  They do spot Westerners from a great distance and will make a direct line toward you to sell you usually either a suit or watch (\"Genuine Copy\" is the a phrase often used). Learn to spot them from a distance (since they are already looking for you), make eye-contact, put up your hand and definitively shake your head. Good, strong body language in this regard will help you be approached far less often.\n\nAlthough the law is strictly enforced, tourist traps are usually designed by villains who are experts at exploiting grey areas in the law.

Going against the trend, Marks & Spencer and Giordano both offer refunds without too much fuss.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Supermarkets and Convenience Stores"]},"\nLike many crowded urban areas where most people rely on public transport, many Hongkongers shop little and often, so therefore there is an abundance of convenience stores which can be found on almost every street corner and in most train stations. These include 7-Eleven, Circle K (known as 'OK' by the locals) and Vanguard. Convenience stores are more expensive but are normally open 24-7 and sell magazines, soft drinks, beer, instant noodles, packaged sandwiches, microwavable ready-meals, snacks, contraceptives and cigarettes. Many stores have an in-store microwave for preparing ready-meals as well as hot water for preparing instant noodles and instant tea\/coffee, and also provide chopsticks for eating food on the go.\n\nPark 'n' Shop and Wellcome are the two main supermarket chains in Hong Kong and they have branches in almost every neighbourhood, some of which open 24-7. In urban areas, some stores are located underground and tend to be very small and cramped, although they have a much wider product choice and are somewhat cheaper than the above convenience stores. City'super, Great and Taste are expensive upmarket supermarkets that focus on high-quality products that are aimed towards a more affluent market.  Apita and JUSCO are large Japanese-style supermarkets with a wide product selection and food courts. The YATA department store in Shatin also offers a Japanese-style supermarket experience.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["eatpricerange"],["Under $50"],["$100-$200"],["Over $300"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Cuisine"]}," plays an important part in many peoples' lives in Hong Kong. Not only is it a showcase of Chinese cuisines with huge regional varieties, but there are also excellent Asian and Western choices. Although Western food is often adapted to local tastes, it is a good place for homesick travellers who have had enough of Chinese food. If you can afford it, you can also find some Western restaurants that are featured in the Michelin guide to Hong Kong.\n\nMagazines for local gourmets are published every week and the Michelin Guide for Hong Kong has been published since 2008. According to ",{"type":"''","value":["Restaurant"]}," magazine in 2010, four of the best 100 restaurants in the world are in Hong Kong.\n\nA long queue can be a local sport outside many good restaurants during peak hours. Normally, you need to register first, get a ticket and wait for empty seats. Reservations are usually only an option in upmarket restaurants.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Cost"]},"\nWhile dining out, you may meet some local people who haven't cooked at home for a decade. For practical reasons, Hong Kongers almost never invite guests to their home, so socialising with friends almost always involves eating out. As such, while eating out is not cheap by Asian standards, it is still significantly cheaper than in Western countries.\n\nTo stuff your stomach in a grassroots Chaa Chan Teng (茶餐廳) (local tea restaurant), expect to pay $10–20 for milk, tea or coffee, $8–10 for a toast and $25–50 for a dish of rice with meats. Wonton noodles generally cost $20–30. You could find it even cheaper in many street stalls (although decreasing in numbers) but most of the people working there do not speak much English (and also no English on the menu). However if you could manage to communicate with them, this street-style eating is an excellent way to experience local food.\n\nThere is always a McDonald's, of course, which sells a Happy Meal set for around $20–25. Most other major fast food eateries can also be found in Hong Kong with reasonable prices.\n\nIn midrange and upmarket restaurants, prices are hard to generalise. In a hotpot restaurant (Korean), $100–150 per head is common, and $200–400 per person is also expected for better choices of food. Sushi is popular with many locals and prices usually start at $100–200 in a self-service bar to several hundred dollars for a tiny portion of high quality food. You can usually tell how cheap (or expensive) it is from the decor of the restaurant (menus are not always displayed outside restaurants).\n\nWestern restaurants, especially in Soho in Central, where rental payments are skyrocketing, tend to be particularly expensive, and $300–$500 per head is common. Fine dining restaurants, usually located at five-star hotels, can cost $500–$1500 per person, more if you are a wine enthusiast. Wine choices in these places are on par with any 5-star hotel.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Etiquette "]},"\n\nChinese food is generally eaten with chopsticks, but don't expect restaurants serving western food to supply chopsticks; dinners will routinely use a knife, fork and spoon. Do not stick your chopsticks vertically into a bowl of rice, as this is reminiscent of incense sticks burning at the temple and has connotations of wishing death on those around you. In addition, chopsticks should not be used to move bowls and plates or make any noise. Dishes in smaller eateries might not come with a serving spoon, although staff will usually provide one if you request it.\n\nA few Hong Kong customs to be aware of:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" To thank the person who pours your tea Cantonese style, ",{"type":"'''","value":["tap two or three fingers"]}," on the table.

Common items include  steamed shrimp dumplings (蝦餃 har gau), pork dumplings (燒賣 siu mai), barbecued pork buns (叉燒包 char siu bau), and Hong Kong egg tarts (蛋撻 dan tat).

Congee is usually eaten with savoury Chinese doughnuts (油炸鬼 yau char kway) and steamed rice pastry (腸粉 cheong fun) which often has a meat or vegetable filling.\n\nHong Kong has several restaurant chains that specialise in congee, but none of them have earned the word-of-mouth respect from local gourmets.

Usually starting at 2PM to 3PM, a typical tea set goes with a cup of 'silk-stocking' tea, egg tarts and sandwiches with either minced beef, egg or ham, but without vegetables and cheese.\n\nSimilar to Malaysian 'teh tarik', Hong Kong's variation shares a similar taste. The key difference is that a sackcloth bag is used to filter the tea leaves and the tea-dyed sackcloth resembles silk stockings, giving the name 'silk-stocking milk tea'. Milk tea, to some Hong Kong people, is an important indicator on the quality of a restaurant. If a restaurant fails to serve reasonably good milk tea, locals might be very harsh with their criticism. \"Yuanyang\" is also a popular drink mixed with milk tea and coffee.\n\nA signal to tell you teatime has come is a small queue lining up in bakery to buy egg tarts (a teatime snack with outer pastry crust and filled with egg custard).  Don't attempt to make a fool of yourself by telling people that the egg tart was brought to Hong Kong by the British - many locals are assertive in claiming sovereignty over their egg tarts. When a long-established egg tart shop in Central was closed due to skyrocketing rental payments, it became the SAR's main news and many people came to help the owners look for a new place.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Street food "]},"\n\nStreet food is very popular in Hong Kong.

Sometimes the best food is served in the most basic eateries where tables maybe covered in cheap plastic covers rather than a more formal tablecloth. Often, Cantonese people value the food more than the decor. If one of your travelling companions does not like seafood, don't panic, many seafood restaurants have extensive menus that cater for all tastes. A number of seafood restaurants specialise in high quality roast chicken that is especially flavoursome.

Commonly served at wedding parties and other important dining events, shark fin is served in a carefully prepared stew usually at $80 per bowl to $1000.  The consumption of shark fin is a controversial topic and the Hong Kong WWF is campaigning against consumption of this endangered species.\n\nBesides exotic meats, you will also see chicken feet, pig's noses and ears, lungs, stomachs, duck's heads, various types of intestines, livers, kidneys, black pudding (blood jelly) and duck's tongues on the Chinese dining tables.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["International Cuisine"]},"\nDue to the large number of foreign residents in Hong Kong, there are numerous restaurants that serve international cuisine in all price levels and often offer food very close to the foreign original.

These can often be found in, though not restricted to, entertainment districts such as Lan Kwai Fong, Soho or Knutsford Terrace.

Examine the products carefully and look for any poorly printed labels and packages.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Legal matters"]},"\nMost travellers who have got into trouble with the law are involved with illicit drugs. Drugs such as ecstasy (MDMA) and marijuana are subject to tight control and tourists risk immediate arrest if they are found in possession of even small amounts of banned substances. Most Hongkongers tend to have strong negative views against narcotics, including 'soft' drugs such as marijuana.\n\nUnder Hong Kong law, local residents are required to carry Identity Cards with them at all times, and the police frequently carry out spot checks when they have \"reasonable grounds for suspicion\". Tourists are advised by the government to carry their passports but unless you think you are highly likely to be stopped by the police there is no great need; most visitors choose to keep their passport in a safe place. People will not target you because you are dressed well. People in Hong Kong often dress up. Caucasians are rarely targeted by policemen for ID checks. South Asians, especially Pakistanis and Nepalis often get targeted by policemen. As long as you dress well (this does not mean formally), you are unlikely to be targeted\n\nYou are expected to cooperate with the police during their investigations, and understand that they may search your pockets and bags. By law, you can reject a request to search your bags and body in public. You also have the right to refuse to answer any questions, to contact your embassy and to apply for legal assistance. The police are obligated to comply with your request but they may detain you for up to 48 hours.\n\nDiscrimination is known to happen. People with a good educational background and reputable jobs are usually better treated by the police, while young people, those from developing countries and western countries with loose regulations on drugs may experience more frequent checks. The police and the government are exempt from the Race Discrimination Ordinance. However, there is a law to ban any form of police brutality, including verbal attacks and any use of foul language. Call 2866-7700 for the official Independent Police Complaints Council and report the officer's badge number displayed on his\/her shoulder. The complaint will be taken seriously.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Traffic"]},"\nTraffic rules are seriously enforced in Hong Kong. Penalties can be stringent, and road conditions are excellent, although road courtesy still has room for improvement. However, the driving speed can be so fast as to create higher death tolls when accidents happen.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Signage"]}," on the roads in Hong Kong is similar to British usage. Zebra lines (zebra crossings) indicate crossing areas for pedestrians and traffic comes from the right.

Traffic in Hong Kong generally moves fast once the signal turns green. To help both the visually impaired and even people who are not, an audible aid is played at every intersection. Rapid bells indicate \"Walk\"; intermittent bells (10 sets of 3 bells) indicate \"Do Not Start to Cross\"; and slow bells indicate \"Do Not Walk\".\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Jay-walking"]}," is an offence and police officers may be out patrolling accident black-spots. It is not uncommon to see local people waiting to cross an empty road - when this happens, you should also wait because it may be that they have noticed that the police are patrolling the crossing.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Corruption"]},"\nHong Kong is ranked as the world's 13th \"cleanest\" region in the Corruption Perceptions Index by Transparency International which aims to put an end to corruption, above the U.S and most European countries such as Germany and France.\n\nIn Hong Kong, corruption is a serious offence. Unlike mainland China, money given for unfair competition is regarded as corruption, regardless of who the recipients are. Trying to offer a bribe to police officers or civil servants will almost certainly result in arrest and a prison sentence.\n\nThe territory has a powerful anti-corruption police force: the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), which has been taken as a role model by Interpol and the United Nations. A number of countries, such as Australia, have adopted the Hong Kong system to combat corruption.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Demonstrations"]},"\n\nAlthough Hong Kong usually has at least one protest per year (particularly in late June\/July in urban parts of Hong Kong Island, namely Central, Wan Chai or Causeway Bay), they usually do not heavily impact the average tourist in Hong Kong. Just stay away from large crowds of protesters and policemen, though it is safe to say that the demonstrations are rarely as violent as those in other countries.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Hiking"]},"\nSeveral hikers have lost their lives in the wilderness in the past decade. Hikers should equip themselves with detailed hiking maps, a compass, mobile phones, snacks and adequate amounts of drinking water.  Most areas of the countryside are covered by a mobile phone network but in some places you will only be able to pickup a mobile phone signal from mainland China. In this case, it is not possible to dial 999 for emergency assistance. A number of emergency telephones have been placed in Country Parks; their locations are clearly marked on all hiking maps.\n\nHeat stroke is a major problem for hikers who lack experience of walking in a warm climate. If you plan to walk a dog during the hot summer months, remember that dogs are more vulnerable to heat stroke than humans and owners should ensure their pets get adequate rest and water.\n\nThe cooler hiking and camping season in October to February is also the time of the year when hill fires likely strike. At the entrances to country parks you will likely observe signs warning you of the current fire risk. With an average of 365 hill fires a year, you should take the risk of fire seriously and dispose of cigarettes and matches appropriately. According to some hikers' accounts, in places where fires and camping is not allowed, the Staff of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) will most likely fine an offender.\n\nWhile it's generally very safe to hike, the countryside can provide shelter to illegal immigrants and a few cases of robbery have been known. However, the police do patrol hiking routes and most major paths do offer the security of fellow hikers.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Natural disasters"]},"\nNatural disasters are not usually a major issue in Hong Kong. There are no nearby fault lines, so earthquakes are rare and relatively mild when they do happen. The main hazards that Hong Kong faces are typhoons and floods.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Typhoons"]}," normally occur during the months of May to November, and are particularly prevalent during September. Whenever a typhoon approaches within 800 km of Hong Kong, typhoon warning signal 1 is issued. Signal 3 is issued as the storm approaches. When winds reach speeds of 63–117 km\/h, signal 8 is issued. At this point, most nonessential activities shut down, including shops, restaurants and the transport system, offices and schools. Ferry services will be suspended, so visitors should return to their accommodation as soon as possible if they are dependent on these boat services to reach a place of safety.  Signal 9 and 10 will be issued depending on the proximity and intensity of the storm. Winds may gust at speeds exceeding 220 km\/h causing masonry and other heavy objects to fall to the ground. During a typhoon, visitors should heed all warnings very seriously and stay indoors until the storm has passed. Remember that if the eye of the storm passes directly over there will be a temporary period of calm followed by a sudden resumption of strong winds from a different direction.\n\nSome taxis are available during signal 8 or above, but they are under no obligation to serve passengers as their insurance is no longer effective under such circumstances. Taxi passengers are expected to pay up to 100% more when a typhoon strikes.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Rainstorms"]}," also have their own warning system. In increasing order of severity, the levels are amber, red and black. A red or black rainstorm is a serious event and visitors should take refuge inside buildings. A heavy rainstorm can turn a street into a river and cause serious landslides.\n\nThe ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.weather.gov.hk Hong Kong Observatory"]}," is the best place to get detailed weather information when in Hong Kong. In summer a convectional rainstorm may affect only a small area and give you the false impression that all areas are wet.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\nThe quality of medical care in Hong Kong is excellent but expensive for tourists who are not qualified to get a government subsidy. In cases of emergency, treatment is guaranteed, but you will be billed later if you cannot pay immediately. As a tourist, you are required to pay $570 for using emergency services ($100 for Hong Kong residents). Waiting times at hospital emergency rooms can be lengthy for non emergency patients, since people are prioritised according to their situation. If you have a problem making payment in public hospitals, you can apply for financial assistance but you will need to prove your economic status to social workers based in the hospital.\n\nOne common cause of sickness is the extreme temperature change between 35°C humid summer weather outdoors and 18°C air-conditioned buildings and shopping malls. Some people experience cold symptoms after moving between the two extremes. You are recommended to carry a sweater even in the summer-time.\n\nHeat stroke is also common when hiking. Carry enough water and take scheduled rests  before you feel unwell.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Find a doctor"]},"\nHealthcare standards in Hong Kong are on par with the West, and finding a reputable doctor is not much of a problem should you get sick. Doctors are of two types: those who practise traditional Chinese medicine and those who practise the Western variety. Both are taken equally seriously in Hong Kong, but as a visitor the assumption will be to direct you to a Western doctor. Doctors who practice Western medicine almost always speak English fluently, but you may find the receptionist to be more of a challenge.\n\nSeeing a doctor is as easy as walking off the street and making an appointment with the receptionist. Generally you will be seen within an hour or less, but take note of the opening times displayed in the window of the doctor's office. A straightforward consultation for a minor ailment might cost around $150 to $500, but your bill will be inclusive of medicine. In Hong Kong, it is normal for a doctor to sell you medicine. Many surgeries and hospitals will accept credit cards, although check beforehand since sometimes only cash is accepted. Expect to pay more if you visit a swanky surgery in Central. Check the directory ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.hkdoctors.org"]}," maintained by the Hong Kong Medical Association for further information. Help finding general practitioners, medical specialists and dentists might also be available at your consulate.\n\nNote that finding a doctor on a Sunday can be difficult, and hospital A&E rooms will have very long queues on a Sunday.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Tap water"]},"\nAlthough Hong Kong is regarded as one of the most developed regions on Earth, with one of the highest Gini co-efficients in the world, drinkability of water may vary around parts of Hong Kong. Tap water in Hong Kong has been proven to be drinkable, although most of the local people still prefer to boil and chill their drinking water when it is taken from the tap. The official advice from the Water Board is that the water is perfectly safe to drink unless you are in an old building with outdated plumbing and poorly maintained water tanks. Bottled water is strongly recommended by locals but remember that Hong Kong's landfill sites are filling up fast and plastic bottles are a major environmental problem, so use recycling bins where provided.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Pollution"]},"\nDespite Hong Kong's name meaning \"fragrant harbour\", this is not always so. Air pollution is a big problem due to a high population density and industrial pollution from mainland China. During periods of very bad air pollution tourists will find visibility drastically reduced, especially from Victoria Peak. Persons with serious respiratory problems should seek medical advice before travelling to the territory and ensure that they bring ample supplies of any relevant medication.\n\nPollution is a contentious topic in Hong Kong and is the number one issue among environmental campaigners. Much of the pollution originates from factories in mainland China and from Hong Kong motorists. Levels of pollution can vary according to the season. The winter monsoon can bring polluted air from the mainland, while the summer monsoon can bring cleaner air off the South China Sea.\n\nThe air is noticeably less foggy after rainy days.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Respect"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Culture"]},"\nHong Kong has significant cultural differences from mainland China due to its heritage. The bulk of the population are descendants of ethnic Chinese who fled the PRC and found safety in Hong Kong during the colonial era. Locals in Hong Kong have maintained many aspects of traditional Chinese culture that have been abandoned in the mainland, including religion, holidays, music, traditional writing and the use of a regional language (Cantonese). In addition, due to its history, British influences have also been incorporated into the local culture. After it was handed back to China in 1997, the city has maintained an independent and reputable English legal system, effective anti-corruption measures, free press and currency.\n\nHong Kong University surveys the population regularly about identity, and finds that only a minority of citizens identify themselves as Chinese citizens, with most considering themselves part of a distinct Hong Kong identity. This sense of a separate identity has tended to become stronger over the years of polling. Mainland officials seem both bemused and outraged by the growth of such subversive beliefs by seemingly disloyal Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong also has a significant minority of Permanent Residents who are not PRC citizens, and are not ethnically Chinese, but are recognised as de-facto citizens by the Basic Law. This includes descendants of British and Gurka populations from the colonial era.\n\nThe Sino-Hong Kong relationship, as always, is a contentious and complicated issue. Locals in Hong Kong generally do not deny their Chinese roots, and they do take pride in being culturally and ethnically Chinese; any racist remarks against Chinese people or crude remarks on traditional Chinese customs will certainly offend Hong Kong people. On the other hand, many locals consider the mannerisms of mainland Chinese to be crude and uncivilised, and there have been some simmering tensions between locals and mainlanders in recent years as a result of these cultural differences. You will hear the phrase \"Mainland China\" (Daai luk) or \"Interior Land\" (Noi dei) a lot from Hong Kong people, who seek to distinguish themselves, both culturally and politically, from other Chinese.\n\nGenerally speaking, it is best not to get into a discussion about mainland Chinese with local Hong Kong people.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Religion"]},"\nMany world religions are practiced freely in Hong Kong, and discussing religion with local Hong Kong people is usually not a problem. \nThe Falun Gong religion is tolerated in Hong Kong, unlike the mainland where it is banned.\nJust like in mainland China, Swastikas are used in Hong Kong as a religious symbol for Buddhists, as well as the Hindu minority. They do not represent Nazism or anti-Semitism.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Politics"]},"\nIn Hong Kong, freedom of speech and the press are protected in law. Hong Kong people are free to criticize their government. Websites are not blocked. Hong Kong bookshops house vividly colourful collections of books about the communist regime and many sensitive political issues. Media, despite the growing concern about self-censorship, are diversified to deliver different voices.\n\nAlthough freedom is secured, Hong Kong people are particularly sensitive about any changes that may affect the freedom they have enjoyed. Once regarded as apolitical and pragmatic, Hong Kong people are also more active in discussing politics, especially the introduction of universal suffrage for electing the Chief Executive.\n\nMajor political rallies take place every year on 4 June commemorating the bloodshed at Tiananmen Square in 1989. The 1st July commemorates the SAR's reunification with China, but after more than 500,000 people took to the streets demanding universal suffrage in 2003, this public holiday has become a symbolic day of protest every year.\n\nLocal political parties are broadly split between pro-Beijing and pro-democracy camps.  While many desire universal suffrage, a right that Beijing has promised but thus far refused to grant, many also try not to offend the mainland as Hong Kong's prosperity is thought to depend on further economic integration with China. The  differences can also be observed on many topics such as the Tiananmen Massacre in 1989, independence of Tibet and Taiwan, and democracy in China. In Hong Kong where information is freely circulated and people are well read, political opinions are extremely diverse. After all, the city has been served as an information hub for China (and Taiwan before the 1990s) to competitively circulate both propaganda and \"dissident views\". In Hong Kong, discussing politics may lead you into a debate, but not any trouble.\n\nUnlike Taiwan, the independence movement has never been widely discussed before and after 1997 and it has hardly gained any public support. Hong Kong people, despite apparently sounding \"dissident\" and \"un-Chinese\" on many topics, hardly deny that they are ethnically Chinese who have the same affections and sentiments as other Chinese people.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Manners and Etiquette"]},"\nHong Kong is a fast-paced society where the phrase \"m goi\" (唔該, \"m\" sounds like \"hmm\"), which literally means \"I should not (bother you)\", is used pervasively in a situation that you would say \"Excuse me\" or \"Thank you\".\n\nThe \"M goi\" (I should not) mentality extends to a way that they don't want to bother anyone as long as possible. When you get a cough, always cover your mouth with the inner side of your elbow, as that area of your arm does not frequently come in contact with other people, thus avoiding the spread of pathogens. When having a fever, wear a mask. Spitting and littering, an offence subject to a penalty of $1,500, is considered rude because it disturbs others. Hong Kong is noisy due to its huge population density but adding more noises, which will certainly disturb others too, is not welcome. Speaking vociferously over the phone on the bus, for example, will be viewed as egocentric and boorish.\n\nQueue jumping is a taboo and you may be denied service if you do so, because everyone wants to go orderly and speedily on their way with the least disturbance. When smoking in front of a non-smoker, always ask for a permission because they may think you are trying to seriously disturb their health. Many smokers will just walk away to smoke, even in a place where smoking is legally allowed.\n\nUnlike public transport in some large cities such as Tokyo or London, where it is common to see passengers eat or drink (even in a cautious manner that keeps the surroundings clean), such behaviour is strictly prohibited in all areas of MTR stations, train compartments (except intercity trains), and most buses. This is due to concerns about maintaining cleanliness of public facilities, and there have been cases where misbehaving mainland Chinese visitors have been scolded by locals after refusing to stop consuming food and reacting to locals rudely. Drinking a few mouthfuls of pure water is usually tolerated, but it would be common for a local passenger to politely ask you to stop consuming or even dispose of your food if you're eating it obviously (for example, eating a hamburger and holding a coke). If this happens, just obey the request and reply politely, and you'll always be out of trouble.\n\nWhile Hong Kong has a generally good reputation when it comes to customer service, it is considered strange to strike up pleasantries with a stranger unless they are pregnant, disabled or senior citizens who are obviously in need. Saying \"good morning\" to a person you don't know at a bus stop will probably be viewed with suspicion. It is unusual for people to hold doors for strangers, and supermarket staff or bank cashiers seldom ask about your day. Staff in shops and restaurants might not even say \"thank you\" when you pay.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Superstition"]},"\nSuperstition is part of the Hong Kong psyche and it can be observed everywhere. Many buildings are influenced by the Fengshui principles which refer to a decoration style that blends the Five Elements (Gold, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth) together, which will turn out to bring you luck, fortune, better health, good examination results, good relationships, and even a baby boy, according to their believers.\n\nMany buildings come without 14th and 24th floors, which phonetically mean \"you must die\" and \"you die easily\". They love the numbers 18 (you will get rich), 369 (liveliness, longevity, lasting), 28 (easy to get rich), and 168 (get rich forever).\n\nHong Kong people love to joke about their superstitious thoughts but that doesn't mean they ignore them. When visiting your friends in Hong Kong, never give them a clock as a gift because \"giving a clock\" phonetically means \"attending one's funeral\". No pears will be served in a wedding party because \"sharing a pear\" sounds like \"separation\". Some people refuse to open an umbrella indoor because a ghost spirit, who is thought to fear sunshine, will hide themselves in it. Breaking a mirror will bring you 7 unlucky years.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Business"]},"\nWhen you give or receive a business card, always do it with both hands and with a slight dip of your head or you will be seen as either disrespectful and ignorant, even if you are a foreigner. Welcoming someone should also be done with a slight dip of the head and with a customary firm handshake, but there is no need to bow.\n\nYou will find that the cashier may hand you receipts or change with both hands too.  This is considered a gesture of respect.  Because you're the patron, it is up to you to do the same or not when handing cash to the cashier.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Dress"]},"\nWhen the thermometer hits 30 degrees Celsius, expect to see many local people wearing warm clothing - this is to protect against the harsh air-conditioning often found on public transport and in places like cinemas and shopping malls. This is actually wise, since the extreme change in temperatures can make people feel ill.\n\nIn contrast, when the temperature starts to go under 20 degrees Celsius, people start wearing very warm clothing to protect themselves from the 'cold'.\n\nHong Kong women are known for their fairly conservative dress code, although wearing halter-necks and sleeveless tops is not uncommon and acceptable, while teenagers and young adults can very frequently be seen wearing hot pants or short shorts. Public nudity is prohibited. Being completely naked on the beach is also prohibited.\n\nThe dress code for men, especially tourists, is less conservative than it used to be. Even in 5-star hotels, smart casual is usually acceptable; although you might want to make your own enquiries in advance before dining in those places. Tourists from colder climates sometimes assume that wearing shorts in the tropics is a sensible idea, but hairy knees can look out of place in urban Hong Kong.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Gay and Lesbian Hong Kong"]},"\nHomosexuality was decriminalised in 1991. The age of consent between two males is 16 according to the ruling by the Hong Kong Court of Appeal in 2006, while there is no law concerning that between two females. Same sex marriages are not recognised and there is no anti-discrimination legislation on the grounds of sexuality. The display of public affection, while not common, is generally tolerated, but it will almost certainly attract curious stares. Gay bashing is unheard of, although an effeminate boy could be a target for school bullying.\n\nHong Kong people generally respect personal freedom on sexuality. The prominent celebrity film star, Leslie Cheung, openly admitted that he was bisexual but his work and personality are still widely respected. His suicide in 2003 shocked many, and his fans, mainly female, showed considerable support for his partner.\n\nWhile gay pride parades have recently been held in Hong Kong, there is no obvious gay community in daily life. Coming out to strangers or in the office is still regarded as peculiar and most people tend to remain silent on this topic.\n\nGay bars and clubs are concentrated in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong\/Central Hong Kong Island"],["Central, Sheung Wan"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong\/Eastern Hong Kong Island"],["Causeway Bay"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong\/Kowloon"],["Tsim Sha Tsui"]]}," (TST).
