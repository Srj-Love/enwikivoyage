Eventually, in 1845, Kamehameha III officially moved the kingdom's capital from Lahaina on Maui to Honolulu.\n\nHonolulu's ideally located port made the city a perfect stop for merchant ships traveling between North America and Asia, and through the 1800s, descendants of missionaries who arrived in the early 1800s established their headquarters in Honolulu, making it the center of business and the main seaport for the Hawaiian Islands.\n\nThe late 1800s and early 1900s brought the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy and subsequent annexation by the United States. Under American rule, Honolulu saw the rise of tourism and the first hotels were constructed in Waikiki. The U.S. military also built numerous bases in the islands, including nearby Pearl Harbor. Pearl Harbor later became known for the surprise attack by the Japanese in 1941, which brought the U.S. into World War II in the Pacific.\n\nStatehood for the islands brought rapid economic growth to Honolulu, with all the state's major businesses headquartered in the city, the Honolulu airport as the primary entrance point for visitors, and Waikiki as the center of the island's tourism industry.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nHonolulu has a very moderate climate, with very little change of temperature throughout the year - the average high is 80-90°F (27-32°C) and the average low is 65-75°F (19-24°C) any time of the year. Water temperature averages 82°F (27°C) in the summer months and 77°F (25°C) in the winter months.\n\nThe only noticeable variation in seasons is in terms of rainfall. Honolulu is on the sunny, leeward side of the island, and where you are in the city will affect the chances for rain - areas like Waikiki, downtown, and the western side of the city will usually be sunny, while the hills or eastern side of the city may get some passing clouds and very brief rainfall. On average, Honolulu gets less than half an inch of rain in the summer months to almost three inches in the winter months.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/hawaii.gov\/hnl Honolulu International Airport"]}]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["HNL"]]},") is the main aviation gateway for the Hawaiian Islands.  The main terminal is served by most major American airlines from the mainland U.S., and by many international airlines from other countries around the Pacific Rim.  Its Inter-Island Terminal is the home base of ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.hawaiianair.com\/ Hawaiian Airlines"]}]}," which offers frequent local service to the other Hawaiian islands. It is quite a walk between terminals, so be sure to take the free Wikiwiki Shuttle that runs every few minutes. It's easy to miss it so be sure to ask somebody where it is.\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Airport Waikiki Express"]}," provides shuttle service to hotels in Waikiki every half hour ($9\/$15 one-way\/round-trip). City buses #19 and #20 ($2.50 per adult and $1.25 per child or senior, exact change required, bills and coins accepted) also come to the airport once every half-hour, going through downtown and on to Waikiki.  You can catch them on the outside second level of the international and domestic departure terminals.\n\nThe best way to get to Waikiki by rental car is to follow signs for H-1 east, then follow H-1 east about 2 miles to exit 18A (Waikiki\/Nimitz Highway).  Follow Nimitz Highway (which turns into Ala Moana Boulevard past downtown Honolulu) straight into Waikiki.  You will pass through Honolulu's industrial district, along Honolulu Harbor, and past downtown Honolulu and the Ala Moana Shopping Center. You can also follow H-1 east into downtown Honolulu, take either exit 22 (Kinau Street) or 23 (Punahou Street), and follow signs to Waikiki.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By ship"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cruise ships"]]}," frequently link Honolulu with the U.S. mainland. These voyages are designed for tourists, and are rarely used as one-way passenger service.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Navigating"]},"\nUnlike many cities on the U.S. mainland, Honolulu is not laid out in a strict compass-point grid.  Its street system conforms in large part to the shorelines, valleys, and ridges, with lots of twists and turns.  It can be confusing for people used to straight grid systems.  However, at the same time, it is not that difficult to navigate in, as long as you are familiar with the major arterials and terminology below.\n\nBecause it is difficult to differentiate north and south on an island, directions are normally given in terms of local landmarks.  The most common terms that you will run into are ",{"type":"'''","value":["mauka"]}," (Mow-kah) meaning \"toward the mountain\" and ",{"type":"'''","value":["makai"]}," (mah-KAI) meaning \"toward the sea\".  In the case of Honolulu, which is on Oahu's south shore, \"mauka\" is a rough north, and \"makai\" roughly south.  You will also hear ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ewa-bound"]}," (Eh-vah) and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Town-bound"]}," used a lot, in relation to downtown Honolulu, the former roughly means \"west\" (toward the town of Ewa on the southwest shore of Oahu) and the latter roughly means \"east\" (towards Honolulu; locals refer to Honolulu proper as \"town\"). Highway signs, however, will use standard compass directions, so if you are asked to go Ewa-bound on the freeway, look for the on-ramp to H-1 west.\n\nIt is a very good idea to invest in a good map of Honolulu before doing extensive driving.  Members of the American Automobile Association (AAA) can request fold-out maps for free from their local office.  Rand McNally paper fold-out maps are available in many stores; for more extensive coverage you can also purchase Bryan's Sectional Maps (a popular choice among locals) at most bookstores for about $9.50.  GPS-enabled devices can also be used to navigate around Honolulu, and Oahu.\n\nStreets in Honolulu can be extremely narrow compared to the mainland. Locals are used to this lack of space on roads but if you are coming from the mainland and are used to wide roads, prepare yourself for driving very close to the cars around you. Just take a little extra caution and you should not have any problems. Once outside of Honolulu proper, the roads will be a bit wider.\n\nPlease take note that many intersections on busy streets in town do prohibit left turns, especially intersections on Kapiolani Boulevard, due to flow of traffic and other various reasons.\n\nIf coming from the mainland, speed limits on roads in Honolulu are generally lower than you may be used to. For example, six-laned King Street is 25–30 miles per hour for its entire length. Most streets are no more than 25 miles per hour. In addition to this, many people disregard the speed limit, instead driving ",{"type":"'''","value":["slower"]},", which may be frustrating.\n\nDuring periods of rain at night, the lane markings on the roads will not be easily visible even to people with excellent vision. Take extreme caution during these times.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Rules of the road"]},"\nThere are a few rules to take note of, especially if you come from a foreign country and are not used to driving in the United States:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["City and County ordinance prohibits using or simply holding any electronic device while behind the wheel.

There are two main highways in Honolulu:  ",{"type":"'''","value":["Nimitz Highway"]}," (Hawaii 92) which runs from Pearl Harbor past Honolulu Airport to downtown Honolulu and Waikiki; and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Interstate H-1"]}," which runs mauka (mountain-ward) of downtown and runs the entire length of the south shore of Oahu.\n\nH-1 is some distance away from Waikiki itself and you need to go onto surface streets to and from Waikiki.  If you need to access H-1 west from Waikiki to go someplace outside of the city, there are three main routes:\n# Go mauka to Ala Wai Boulevard and follow it 'Ewa-bound to McCully Street.  Follow McCully mauka for about 1 mile; it will take you over H-1.  At the foot of the bridge, turn left on Dole, then left again onto Alexander to the freeway onramp.\n# Follow Kuhio or Kalakaua Avenue Diamond Head-bound to Kapahulu Avenue.  Follow Kapahulu mauka for about 1 mile, it will take you under H-1 and lead you to the freeway onramp.\n\nTo get back to Waikiki from H-1 east, take any of these routes:\n# Take exit 22 (Kinau Street). Turn right on Ward Avenue and follow it to Ala Moana Boulevard.  Turn left on Ala Moana and follow it into Waikiki.\n# Take exit 23 (Punahou Street).  Turn right on Punahou, and stay in lane #3 from the left.  This lane is right-turn only onto the left side of Beretania.  Take an immediate left onto Kalakaua Avenue from Beretania.  Follow Kalakaua into Waikiki.\n# Take exit 25A (King Street).  After merging onto King Street, stay to the right.  Take the second right onto Kapahulu Avenue (follow signs to Waikiki).  Follow Kapahulu into Waikiki.\n# Take exit 23 (Punahou Street).  Stay straight to merge onto Bingham Street. Turn right onto McCully Street and keep left to merge into traffic from the overpass. Follow McCully to Waikiki.\n\nThere are also several routes from H-1 to downtown and back. To get to downtown from H-1 east, use one of these routes:\n# Take exit 21B (Punchbowl Street). This will take you to the Capitol area.\n# Take exit 21A (Pali Highway). Turn right onto Pali Highway, which will curve to the left and become Bishop Street. This will take you to the downtown business district and Aloha Tower.\n# Take exit 22 (Kinau Street). Turn right onto Ward Avenue, then turn right onto Beretania Street. This will take you to the Capitol area and Chinatown.\n# Take exit 20B (Vineyard Blvd). This will take you to northern downtown.\n\nTo get to H-1 west from downtown, use one of these routes:\n# Go north on Punchbowl Street (from the Capitol area), which will merge into a ramp at the end of the street. At the fork at the end of the ramp, keep left.\n# Go north on Alakea Street (from Chinatown), turn left onto Beretania Street, turn right onto Pali Highway, turn left onto School Street, and keep left onto the H-1 ramp.\n# Go east on Kinau Street, turn left onto Piikoi Street, turn left onto Lunalilo Street, then keep left onto the H-1 ramp.\n# Go west onto Vineyard Blvd, which will become Halona Street after the H-1 overpass. Keep left onto the H-1 ramp.\n\nIn central Honolulu, the two main streets are ",{"type":"'''","value":["King Street"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Beretania Street"]},".  The two streets are one-way for most of their route; King Street runs from 'Ewa to Diamond Head, and Beretania Street from Diamond Head to 'Ewa.  Both streets run parallel through downtown Honolulu.  Despite their rough west to east orientation, addresses on these streets are designated North and South respectively (the streets form an S curve, running north-south through downtown).  The dividing line between North and South designations is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Nuuanu Avenue"]}," in downtown Honolulu, which runs mauka-makai.  ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ala Moana Boulevard"]}," is a key route leading out of Waikiki to Downtown Honolulu.

In fact, Honolulu's rush hour has been ranked among the worst in the nation.  There are almost one million people living in a relatively small space, and only a few main routes connecting the major populated areas on the island to each other and to downtown Honolulu. As a result, a single traffic incident has the potential to induce gridlock across the entire island. You are unlikely to encounter a traffic jam of that magnitude, but someone visiting Oahu and traveling during a weekday should be aware of traffic problems.\n\nNormal weekday ",{"type":"'''","value":["rush hour"]}," in Honolulu is 5AM to 8AM going inbound and 3PM to 6:30PM going outbound.  Expect heavy traffic on Interstates H-1 and H-2, Nimitz Highway\/Ala Moana Boulevard, and the surface streets in downtown Honolulu and Waikiki. However, traffic congestion is the norm for most of the daylight hours, often crawling along at less than ten miles per hour on the freeway, and often congested near onramps and offramps on the surface streets. There is almost always a slow down during the day on the H-1 between the Likelike and Punahou exits, often in both directions. On the H-1 eastbound (toward downtown Honolulu), the interchange at Middle Street (H-1 & H-201), the Vineyard Boulevard and Ward Avenue onramps, and the H-1\/H-2 Merge are some of the worst bottlenecks, especially during rush hour. The merge at Middle Street has been named the single most congested section of freeway in the United States. Traffic is less heavy during the summer and over the holidays when the University of Hawaii at Manoa and public and private schools are not in session. Maybe a unique thing about Honolulu is that while traffic congestion is high, drivers are generally courteous and will let you in front of them if you signal beforehand and wave after.\n\nAll in all, though, driving on Oahu is pleasurable once you get off of the Interstates. Having a car on Oahu gives a visitor a chance to visit the whole island in just a few days. Once you get a little ways inland, the traffic is not too bad, and in the agricultural areas there is little traffic. Unless you are familiar with this climate, convertible tops should be up when the sun is intense.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nThe local bus service in Honolulu is called, with remarkable succinctness, ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.thebus.org\/ TheBus"]}]},".
