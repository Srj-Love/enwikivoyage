Hope is well-known as the gateway to British Columbia's interior, and serves as the junction of 5 major highways. Outside of the Lower Mainland, Vancouver Island, and Whistler areas, going anywhere in British Columbia by road requires travelling through Hope. Locals like to say that the rest of British Columbia is \"Beyond Hope\". \n\nWhile is might be easy to dismiss this small town as just a place to gas up and grab a Timmy's coffee, Hope is justifiably popular as four season travel destination in its own right. Nestled among mighty peaks, at the confluence of three rivers, Hope is an excellent base for exploring some of the best scenery Canada has to offer. The Hope area offers outdoor recreational opportunities from hiking, downhill and cross-country skiing, fishing, and hunting, to all types sports in and on the water. \n \nThe Sto:lo First Nations were the early residents of the area. Explorer Simon Fraser arrived in what is now Hope in 1808, with the Hudson's Bay Company creating the Fort Hope trading post in 1848. The Fraser River and Fraser Street is named for the explorer, while Hudson's Bay Street and Fort Street in Hope commemorate the town's origins.\n\nHope was transformed in 1858 and onward by the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush as thousands of miners flooded into the region. Spurred by the gold rush and the desire of the British to solidify their claim to control in the face of thousands of American prospectors pouring in, the Colony of British Columbia was created on 2 August 1858, while the Colony of British Columbia joined Canada in 1871 after being promised a railway connection to eastern Canada, which came through Hope.\n\nFounded as a trading post because of its strategic location at the confluence of multiple river valleys, built up because it lay at a choke point into the gold fields, and today a major junction of highways, Hope exists because of its strategic location as the only way to get to so many places. \n\nHope incorporated as a village (District) on 6 April 1929, became a town on 1 January 1965, and was reincorporated as a district municipality named the District of Hope on 7 December 1992.\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Highway 1 - West"]}," (the Trans-Canada Highway) follows the Fraser Valley to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vancouver"]]}," as a fully controlled access route. which merges seamlessly with Highway 5.
