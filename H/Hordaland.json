[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["UlvikfjordMountains banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.hordaland.no\/ Hordaland"]}]}," is a county (",{"type":"''","value":["fylke"]},") in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["West Norway"]]},". It is a mountainous region with fjords and islands, on the North Sea coastline, as well as high mountains and glaciers. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bergen"]]}," - Norway's second city and an important destination - sits in the middle of the county. Hordaland stretches from the weather beaten North Sea coast through the gentle fertile slopes of the great fjords to alpine mountains with glaciers and high plateaus. The terrain is extremely fragmented, particularly near the ocean, while the interior is more dominated by grand fjord\/mountain landscapes.  Hordaland includes the charming city of Bergen (Norway's main city for several hundred years) and other key settlements on islands and along fjords. The name \"Norway\" (\"way to the North\") originally referred to the sea lane from somewhere around present Stavanger through the political centres on Hordaland coast and further north.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Regions"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Regionlist"],["regionmap=Hordaland regions.png"],["regionmaptext=Hordaland regions"],["regionmapsize=370px"],["region1name=Nordhordland"],["region1color=#e2e300"],["region1items=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fedje"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Austrheim"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Radøy"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lindås"]]},", northern ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vaksdal"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Masfjorden"]]},"."],["region1description="],["region2name=Bergen Region"],["region2color=#ff4646"],["region2items=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bergen"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Austevoll"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Os (Hordaland)"],["Os"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sund"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fjell"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Øygarden"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Askøy"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Meland"]]},", southern ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vaksdal"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Samnanger"]]},"."],["region2description="],["region3name=Hardanger and Voss"],["region3color=#00c500"],["region3items=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Voss"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kvam"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Granvin"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ulvik"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Eidfjord"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ullensvang"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Odda"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jondal"]]},"."],["region3description="],["region4name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sunnhordland"]]}],["region4color=#0000d9"],["region4items=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sveio"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bømlo"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Stord"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fitjar"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tysnes"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kvinnherad"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Etne"]]},"."],["region4description="]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities and towns"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Vøringfossen.jpg"],["thumb"],["200px"],["Vøringsfossen with canyon"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bergen"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Eidfjord"]]}," - part of the great Hardangerfjord and home to Vøringsfossen waterfall"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Finse"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Leirvik"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Odda"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rosendal"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Stalheim"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ulvik"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Voss"]]}," - a village and wide district in the centre of Hordaland, winter sport resort"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Askøy"]]}," - island and suburb to Bergen"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Austevoll"]]}," - archipelago south of Bergen"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fedje"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hardanger"]]}," - the area defined by the grand, iconic Hardangerfjord"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Os (Hordaland)"],["Os"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The county is administered and promoted by ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hordaland Fylkeskommune"]},"  Tel: +47 55 23 92 84, Fax: +47 55 23 90 01."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nHordaland has two airports of interest to the traveller; Bergen Airport, Flesland, Norway's second largest airport, and Stord Airport, Sørstokken.

After the Hardanger Bridge use road 13 and E16 towards Bergen.\n\nFrom Hardanger, you can also drive along the Hardanger Fjord to Bergen. This road is a designated \"National Tourist Road\" by the Norwegian government, and goes through four small towns (Granvin proper, Øystese, Norheimsund and Samnanger) before meeting European route E16 just after entering Bergen municipality. You can also, instead of using the Hardanger Bridge, drive towards Odda. From Odda, you can continue following RV 13 southwards into the southernmost part of Hordaland, Rogaland or Telemark. You can also drive through the Folgefonn tunnel, slightly north of Odda, and onwards to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rosendal"]]}," and southern Hordaland.\n\nEntering Hordaland from Rogaland (south) is rather straightforward.
