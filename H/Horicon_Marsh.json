Upon coming to the area in the mid 1800s, white settlers commenced to alter the marsh, and in the 1900s, the marsh was even drained.  The fact that the marsh exists today is a testament to the hard efforts of forward-thinking individuals and the adaptability of Mother Nature.  Through the efforts of concerned citizens, conservationists and sportsmen in the 1930s, the water levels of the marsh were restored and the marsh was slowly reborn.  The old roots and seeds of the marsh plants that were dormant for decades suddenly came back to life.  Flocks of birds, including some species which hadn't been seen on the marsh for decades, returned each year in greater numbers.  The marsh you see today is a result of 70 years of careful management.  When you look out over the vast marsh, you aren't just seeing the wonders of nature--you're witnessing an ongoing success story.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\nThe Horicon Marsh has 32,000 acres of water, woods, and prairie.  \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\nThe Horicon Marsh has 32,000 acres of water, woods and plantlife.
