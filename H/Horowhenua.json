The beaches are a rolling playground for the whole family.  Swimming, sailing, surfing, and fishing, diving or just lazing the hours away soaking up the sun.  The children can discover places to build driftwood shelters.  The dogs can run loose, while you unwind from the stresses of the year.  \n\nLevin has a marvellous children's adventure playground, including volleyball court to exhaust their energy and a BBQ area to fuel them up for more fun.  \n\nFor a bit of nature experience the Manawatu River at Foxton Beach is listed as a Wetland of International Importance.  The bird life has to be seen to be believed.\n\nA must on the visitor list is Owlcatraz in Shannon.  Levin's Murrayfield Clyesdales is another good stop for country food at the cafe whilst the kids can feed the farm animals.  \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["-40.5890"],["175.3430"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["North_Island"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Horowhenua District"]]}]
