In the nineties the Ferrari formula one racing team made a present of one of these statues of its famous logo to each of their F1 drivers. This one was shipped to Ireland in 1999 to be given to Eddie Irvine who had finished as runner up in the World championship for Ferrari that year. It was stored in a barn in County Tyrone and was to be a surprise to Irvine. However just before this was to take place Irvine told Ferrari he was leaving them to join the Jaguar team. Ferrari never told Irvine about the statue and it stayed in the barn for a year until a local farmer from Horseleap was up in Tyrone buying cattle and was told about it. A delegation from the village was then dispatched to make the case that they had the ideal home for this statue and that they wished to purchase it. They bought the statue for a fee less than it cost to make and it was erected in 2000."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Garden Centre"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=See the flowers in the award winning Garden Centre"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Visit a Spa"],["url=http:\/\/www.templespa.ie\/"],["email="],["address=outside Horseleap"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=53.4052 N  7.6036 W"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Relax in a Spa"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["drink"],["name=Paddy Ryans"],["url="],["email="],["address=Horseleap"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kilbeggan"]]}," is around 5 minutes away.
