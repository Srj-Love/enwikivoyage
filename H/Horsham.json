West Sussex is a relatively rural county in southern England, and Horsham provided a focus for people to gather and trade in times gone by.\n\nOver recent years, Horsham has grown significantly, being a commutable distance from London and Gatwick Airport, while still having the benefits of the countryside.\n\nHorsham is also the site for Novartis-UK Affiliate of the Swiss based company Novartis AG ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.novartis.co.uk\/index.shtml"]},". The R&D here focuses on Metabolic disorders, GI tract diseases and such.\n\nIn its recent history Horsham has been one of the main headquarters for the international firm Royal & SunAlliance which still opens and operates in some of the towns largest buildings.  The recent Yes! Car Credit which went bankrupt was also based in Horsham.\n\nTraditionally not known for its open mindedness (The film 'Monty Python's Life of Brian' was banned here upon its release, and Horsham was one of the last places in England someone faced the death penalty for homosexuality). Despite this the town does show some signs of moving forward despite being a little 'backward' compared to London or Brighton, perhaps due to the older demographic. Horsham is also one of the last places on Earth to still display its stocks in the town centre.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nThe closest airport to Horsham is London Gatwick (LGW) which is only 20 minutes by car or train (the station is right in the airport).

A small number of bus services are available to the residential areas. All services run via the bus station and the central square, the Carfax.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nHorsham's town centre is its main charm. The town is based around a central square (that isn't square) called the Carfax (said to mean 'where four roads meet'). This is pedestrianised and often features music on the bandstand in the summer. There is also an element of European cafe culture with  street cafes and alfresco bars on the square and the historic alleyways running from it. The rest of the centre is no more than five minutes walk from the Carfax.\n\nNearby, to the South is The Causeway, a conservation area with a real feeling of history about it. Horsham Museum is also located on The Causeway.  At the bottom of The Causeway is St. Marys church and the River Arun.\n\nThe second focal point to the town is the Shelley Fountain named after the poet Shelley who hailed from Horsham. It is a large mobile artwork which is an earthlike sphere which takes in and releases water causing it to rise and fall on a pillar.  The town's main shopping street, the pedestrian only West Street, connects the Carfax to the Shelley Fountain square. The Swan Walk mall runs off this street.\n\nTo the north is a large park, which has a small wildlife pond,a leisure complex with indoor\/outdoor (heated) pool and a gym.

Most are located just to the west, in the Bishopric and Springfield Road. Including Mr Li's, a highly popular Chinese restaurant, renowened locally for its food\n\nPerhaps one of Horshams best restaurants is the Indian Tree curry house.
