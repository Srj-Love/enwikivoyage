The British 'discovered' the plateau in 1834 and  renamed the area after Sir Robert Wilmot-Horton, the British governor of Ceylon from 1831 to 1837, who travelled to the area to meet the Ratemahatmaya of Sabaragamuwa in 1836.\n\nStone tools dating back to the Balangoda culture (who existed from around 30,000 to around 10,000 BCE) have been found here. The local population who resided in the lowlands ascended the mountains to mine gems, extract iron ore, construct an irrigation canal and fell trees for timber. A 6-metre (20 ft) pollen core extracted from a mire revealed that in the late quaternary period the area had a semi-arid climate and a species-restricted plant community.\n\nSir Joseph Dalton Hooker advised the British Government \"to leave all Montane Forests above 5000 ft. undisturbed\" and an administrative order to this effect was issued in 1873 that prevented clearing and felling of forests in the region. Horton Plains was designated as a wildlife sanctuary in 1969, and because of its biodiversity value, was elevated to a national park in 1988. The Peak Wilderness Sanctuary which lies in west is contiguous with the park.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nSome routes to the area are discussed in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["World Heritage Sites Tour in Sri Lanka"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\nThe official department responsible for Horton Plains National Park is: http:\/\/www.dwc.gov.lk\/\nYou can contact them for fees\/ permits.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Horton Plains National Park Circuit Trail (9km trek)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Baker's Falls"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Worlds End (Mini & Greater)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Mt.
