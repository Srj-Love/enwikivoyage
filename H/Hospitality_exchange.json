[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["TT Banner.jpg"]]},"\nA ",{"type":"'''","value":["hospitality exchange"]}," or ",{"type":"'''","value":["home stay network"]}," is an organization that connects travelers with local residents in the cities they're visiting. If travelers can connect with the right people at the right time, they can get room and sometimes board in the place they're visiting for free or at a deep discount. Network size goes from a few thousands to a hundred thousands, and most networks are growing steadily.\n\nHome stays have advantages and disadvantages. The most obvious advantage is that accommodation costs are much lower (at most networks for free) than at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Finding accommodation"],["hotels"]]}," or even youth ",{"type":"[[","value":[["hostels"]]},". More important, though, is the opportunity to make a personal connection with someone from a different culture and social classes, you see the destination you're visiting from a local perspective. You have your own adventure and as a side effect, the goal from some networks, this can build and strengthen intercultural understanding and reduce prejudices and intolerance.\n\nThere are disadvantages, though. Home stays require some additional planning before travel, and courtesy requires sticking at least reasonably close to your schedule. There are usually strict limits on the length of stay and what you can do in the home. You often have less privacy than in a hotel. And the opportunity to make a personal connection has its flipside: awkwardness between host and guest can make a visit to an otherwise pleasant city unbearable.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Networks"]},"\nThere are a number of different networks that connect hosts and guests, with different requirements for participation, restrictions for guests and member number and geographical spreading.  Hospitality Club and CouchSurfing are the biggest online organizations with over 300 thousand members. The  number of active members within the different networks is unknown due to a lack of standard definition of what exactly constitutes an active member.\n\nFor many, joining just requires filling out a Web form; some offer and others require further verification. Usually a Web listing or printed book of available hosts is provided, sometimes with eBay like reviews by travellers (or vice versa). All listed networks operate worldwide.\n\nHere are how the various projects index by size (data for CS, HC, GFL, BW and Servas collected from respective sites 7\/15\/12 ; others date from approx. 2010) :\n\n  Members * Organisation\n  -------   ------------\n 1,266,083 * ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#CouchSurfing Project"]]},"    \n   707,253 * ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Hospitality Club"]]},"\n    89,525 * ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#GlobalFreeLoaders"]]},"\n    50,600 * ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#BeWelcome"]]},"\n    50,000 * ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Tripping"]]},"\n    19,172 * ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Servas"]]},"\n    10,824 * ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#WarmShowers.org"]]},"\n     4,000 * ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Evergreen Bed and Breakfast Club"]]}," \n     4,000 * ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Affordable Travel Club"]]},"\n     1,350 * ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Pasporta Servo"]]}," \n       700 * ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Hospitality Exchange"]]},"\n         ? * ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Casa Casa"]]}," \n         ? * ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Belodged.com"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["CouchSurfing Project"]},"\n\nThe CouchSurfing Project ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.CouchSurfing.org"]}," is the largest hospitality exchange organization, founded in January 2004. While it started off as a non-profit organization, in 2011 it became a for-profit C corporation. As of November 2012, there are over 1,200,000 members in 70,000 cities of 236 countries. Membership is free. Profiles are very comprehensive and extended search is possible (allowing to search for specific characteristics such as \"wheelchair accessible\").\n\nThe Terms of Use of couchsurfing are ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/tos-dr.info\/#couchsurfing worse than Facebook's"]}," and probably go against European Union legislation.\n\nOne important feature of this site are the groups. The groups allow people create \"posts\", make questions and interact frequently, creating a strong sense of community. The groups are set by interest (cyclist, vegetarians, alternative consumers,etc) or by location.  When the group functionality was drastically changed in December 2012 this led to one more community outcry.\n\nThere are several security measures. After using the service, you can comment (\"leave a reference\") about your host or guest. You can create links to people you've met through a friend list. It is optional to become \"verified member\" (one-time fee, amount depends on your home country) providing another layer of security and keep the project running. Another safety system like verifying is called vouching, in this system you can vouch for others you know and feel are trustworthy if you yourself have been vouched for by 3 other members. This system was started by allowing the founders and core admins to vouche for others from the start and it is spreading pretty well. It is possible to see if people are traveling themselves, and the percentage of messages responded to. Despite a system failure in June 2006, the majority of the data was recovered, and the system restored to functionality.\n\nThere is also a wiki on the site with helpful notes about couchsurfing, safety, countries, cities and other couchsurfing related topics but the wiki has been marked for deletion.\n\nUnlike the next largest hospitality exchange, Hospitality Club, Couchsurfing is much more focused on \"social networking\", and members organize many events, viewable in a database on the website. Alongside with the surfing\/hosting experience, events are good opportunities to interact with people living or traveling in the places you visit.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Hospitality Club"]},"\n\nThe Hospitality Club ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.hospitalityclub.org\/"]}," is the big hospitality exchange website which was founded in July 2000.  As of November 2012 there are over 700,000 members in 227 countries. Membership is free, and each member is verified by a volunteer team.  The website hasn't seen any visible changes since 2004. There is no official organization and the website is ran like a sole proprietorship of the founder, Veit KÃ¼hne.\n\nTo register a member must provide their full name and address, which is verified by volunteers.  Potential guests can either navigate the database of hosts geographically or use the ",{"type":"''","value":["advanced search"]}," feature. An internal message-sending mechanism is then used, allowing to keep email addresses confidential and to block spam thanks to checking by volunteers. Individuals are free to arrange their own conditions for the exchange within the rules of HC that include the hospitality exchange must be free, but allows for ancillary costs such as food and phone calls to be privately agreed between members.\n\nAfter using the service you can leave a comment for a member which will be visible to all users. The site also includes very active forums, groups, and wiki style travel guides which members can update with local information.  In addition, Hospitality Club has very active group activities, with regular regional meetings and huge camps with sometimes over 400 members attending.  The club is based on the work of volunteers around the world who believe that by bringing people together they can increase intercultural understanding and peace.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["GlobalFreeloaders"]},"\n\nGlobalFreeloaders.com ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.globalfreeloaders.com"]}," is an online hospitality network.

The organization spread rapidly all over the world and has thousands of hosts and travellers in more than 120 countries. Servas is also recognized by the United Nations.\n\nServas recommends applying for the program at least 4 weeks in advance of travel. Participation in Servas requires 2 letters of reference and paying a membership fee, which varies by country, and a personal interview with a local Servas coordinator. After the interview, the traveler gets a \"letter of introduction\" that's good for one year of travel, and a list of hosts in the countries they're visiting.\n\nTravellers contact prospective hosts in advance (lead time varies as defined by each host), giving estimated dates of travel, and they may be asked to reconfirm one or two days in advance of visit. They can stay with hosts for up to 3 days and 2 nights, and are encouraged to stay the full time to develop a deeper relationship with the host.\n\nHosts provide sleeping space, sometimes this may be a guest room.  Meals may be provided as well as assistance in visiting the city or area.\n\nAt the end of their trip, the Servas traveller is expected to provide a report to the local coordinator with updates to host lists (change of address and phone number, for example) and any other information that may be useful.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["BeWelcome"]},"\t \n\t\t \nBeWelcome ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.bewelcome.org"]}," is a five year old service founded in early 2007 by former volunteers of Hospitality Club, grouped in the non profit ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.bevolunteer.org\/ BeVolunteer organization"]},".
