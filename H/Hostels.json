'Hostel' means that, at the minimum, there will be some dormitory accommodation. Hostels usually also have common areas, a youthful and traveller orientation, and information on the local area and travel to other locations. \n\nThe concept of 'youth hostels', as they were originally known, started in about 1910 in Germany and was soon copied in several European countries. Originally, each Hostelling International organisation sought to provide low cost accommodation in rural areas for young city workers, with an emphasis on hiking, cycling and other healthy activities.  \n\nWith the advent of international travel, hostels not affiliated to Hostelling International associations were established: these were often known as  ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Urban backpacking"],["backpackers"]]}," hostels.
