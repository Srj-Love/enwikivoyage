In English the term is used more or less interchangeably for \"wild\" springs, where the water emerges directly from the ground into a natural catchment that can be used for bathing, and \"developed\" springs, which exploit the spring through construction of man-made artifacts such as pools and bath houses.  \"Wild\" springs and \"developed\" springs can differ so much, and in so many ways, that the visitor expecting one and getting the other may not enjoy the experience very much.  Some examples:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Wild springs are often (although not always) on public land or otherwise accessible to the public without charge, while developed springs are almost invariably intended by the developer to make a profit, and hence will charge (and be in a legal position to demand) an admission fee."]},{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Okuhida Bath Kodakara2.JPG"],["thumb"],["240px"],["Hot springs in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oku-Hida"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Japan"]]}]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" You can't count on creature comforts at a wild spring; you may have to sit on a rock at water's edge to doff your clothing, and pre-entry showers are pretty well out of the question, let alone amenities like poolside drinks that a developed spring may offer.

As a consequence, water at wild springs can be uncomfortably, or even dangerously, hot.  Commercial operators of developed springs will generally ensure that the water temperature is appropriate (sometimes offering several choices of temperature in different pools) through dilution of the spring's effluent with water from the commercial supply or other sources.

The distinction can be important in countries and regions where the political\/economic system allows for both for-profit and public-interest\/non-profit\/governmental development; regulations for doing the developing will often differ between the two cases, as will the resulting amenities, access, etc.  For example, as a general rule, springs in the United States that have been developed by government will have fewer amenities, but also lower admission fees, than for-profit developments.  In Japan, many hot springs in rural locations are maintained by the local government and are open to the public for free, and even expensive spa resort towns usually have at least one public bath open to all for a token fee.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Spas"]},"\n\nThere is a difference between a hot spring and a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["spas"],["spa"]]},".

Normal practice at wild springs is much more a local, ad-hoc matter.  As a general but by no means universal rule, in the United States, you should plan on wearing a swimsuit at springs in sight of a road unless the spring is specifically posted as accepting naturism; in the backcountry, you're on your own.  It's wise to err on the side of conservatism, however, as some areas prohibit nude hot spring bathing and enforce the prohibition with fines.
