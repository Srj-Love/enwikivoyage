But in the late 1870s, the lure of the gold and silver deposits in the San Juan Mountains to the south proved too great for the white settler population to resist. Tensions boiled over with the Meeker Massacre in 1879. Pushed to the breaking point by the Federal government's insistence that they give up their nomadic way of life and become farmers, the Utes killed several whites and launched the so-called Ute War. Initially successful, the Utes were forcibly relocated to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Utah"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southwestern Colorado"]]},", near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cortez"]]},".\n\nLess than a year after the Meeker Massacre, the first prospective settlers ventured into the North Fork area.

Led by Enos Throop Hotchkiss, who had made his money by discovering the Golden Fleece mine at Lake City, Hotchkiss's party surreptitiously scouted the valley and picked out likely homesteads while the Utes were still in possession.\n\nHotchkiss died in 1900, just a few months before the town was officially incorporated.\n\nHotchkiss built its economy on land development, coal, orchards and ranching. The coal is still mined today, a hard anthracite, \"clean burning\" coal much in demand for power plants around the country.\n\nA sleepy town with a classic \"Main Street\" row of 19th and early 20th century storefronts, Hotchkiss is a rich agricultural area located in the foothills of the Grand Mesa. The rich soil is perfect for growing peaches, apples, cherries, as well as grapes.\n\nBy the late 20th century, grape growers had discovered the area's potential for raising white wine varietals, and Colorado's wine industry migrated south from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Grand Junction"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Palisade"]]},".
