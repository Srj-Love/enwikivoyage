They range from very basic budget-style to extremely luxurious accommodation. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Booking a room"]},"\nIn most cases, hotel rooms are booked, or reserved, in advance, so that a room will be held by the hotel awaiting the arrival of a specific guest. Rooms at hotels can also be rented by simply walking in and enquiring at the front desk, but this may be met with a decline as the hotel may be fully booked for the night.\n\nRooms can be booked directly with the hotels, or via intermediaries such as travel websites and travel agents. Airlines, railways, ferry operators and other travel-related services providers often act as intermediaries as well, providing their passengers and clients the option to book a hotel room in addition to their regular services.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Room rates"]},"\nThe price paid for staying at the hotel is generally determined by the room rate, i.e. the rate paid for staying each night spent in the room. The base room rate usually does not include anything but accommodation. Other services, as well as meals, usually incur extra charges. Use of some of the room's and hotel's facilities might also not be free for staying guests. It is good to make sure what is included in the rate and what chargeable extra before booking. \n\nHotels usually have a standard rate quoted at the front desk and displayed prominently in the hotel and in the rooms, which is often called the ",{"type":"'''","value":["rack rate"]},". The rack rate is usually the highest rate the hotel would charge for the room, as it is often required by legal restrictions. There are usually many rates one can pay for a given night that are lower than the rack rate, and the value of the rate depends on a number of factors. Knowing how hotels set their offered rates can help you book your desired room cheaper.\n\nSome of the factors that can influence the value of the rate:\n# Advance bookings - special, lower rates are often available when booking in advance. Hotels are very interested in having as many rooms as possible booked early to managed their occupancy better. The best rates are usually offered when booking 21 days or more in advance, but even booking a few days in advance would often get you a better rate than the rack rate you would get when walking into the hotel on the day of your stay.\n# Cancellability - most bookings can be cancelled until the night of the stay, so the hotel risks keeping the room for you and then you cancelling it at the last minute. If you choose a rate that does not allow that, it would usually be lower, but you risk losing money if your plans need to change.\n# Advance payment - you will usually pay for your hotel stay when checking out, but some attractive rates require you to pay in advance.\n# Booking channel - you can sometimes get a better rate booking through a booking consolidator website. Conversely, hotels sometimes offer special rates only when booked via their own websites.\n# Seasonality - most destinations usually have a high season for tourism, when staying there is deemed more desirable, so the rates will be higher then. It is usually dependent on weather conditions (most destinations will see more tourists coming in warmer months, except for skiing destinations, when months with good snow cover will attract most tourists). \n# Special events - There are also some happenings during the year, such as holidays, feasts or special events (e.g. prominent football matches, concerts, festivals) that may affect demand and rates. For business destinations, trade fairs often rack up the rates considerably. If you do not intend to participate in those events, make sure you check the calendar of planned events at your destination and avoid them to avoid the increased rates.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Checking in and out"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:HK Shek Tong Tsui 香港盛貿飯店 Traders Hotel Hong Kong Check-In service counter Aug-2010.JPG"],["300px"],["thumbnail"],["right"],["Check-in and check-out is usually done at the hotel's front desk"]]},"\nOn arriving at the hotel, guests should check in, which means giving the front desk the details of the guests staying in a given room, referring to the booking, confirming rates and conditions, being assigned a room and receiving the key to the room. Checking out is done once a guest's stay is completed. The front desk staff presents the charges incurred and guests settle the bill. The key to the room is returned to the front desk at that time.\n\nHotels usually have fixed check-in and check-out times, given as the earliest hour one can check in at and the latest at which one can check out. Those are usually not the same time - hotels leave a few hours between check-in and check-out times to allow for housekeeping to clean and prepare any rooms that might be vacated at the last possible moment (thus, a day's stay at a hotel is usually shorter than 24 hours even if using all available time). Otherwise, check-in and check-out times are limited by the availability of front desk staff - not all hotels have front desks working 24 hours a day.\n\nThe latest check-out time varies between hotels, but is generally sometime around noon, while check-in is usually possible at times from 2 PM onwards. Earlier check-ins and later check-outs at hotels are usually treated as extra services incurring extra charges. They can sometimes be offered free of charge as perks to some guests and included in some rates or special packages. That said, sometimes hotels will let guests check in early or check out late on inquiry at the front desk with no additional conditions and charges if rooms are available.\n\nPlease note that failure to check out at appropriate check out times on the day your stay ends will often be understood as occupying the room for yet another night and therefore incur a full regular nightly rate. Late check-outs should be agreed upon with the front desk staff beforehand.\n\nIn some hotels, the check-in and check-out can be performed via automated kiosks in the hotel's lobby. This may be provided as a measure of economy (instead of employing staff hotels focusing on low costs offer automated services) or convenience (automated check-in and check-out may be quicker and more comfortable for some travellers in some situations).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Room types"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Hotel-room-renaissance-columbus-ohio.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["A typical twin hotel room."]]},"\nWithin a single hotel property, many different rooms may be available.

Such bathrooms are usually located in common hallways and are intended for use by all occupants of the rooms in a given floor. Often a hotel room that is not ensuite will still include a sink with running water or even also a toilet.\n\nSome hotels also offer bathrooms especially fitted to cater for the needs of disabled guests. This include special handlebars and supports, a folded seat in a shower stall and other fitments to enable comfortable use by a person with limited mobility, e.g. using a wheelchair, elderly or infirm. Guests requiring such facilities should make sure a property provides them and communicate this need at the time of booking.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Types of beds "]},"\nThe following terms are based on the North American standard for mattress sizes, which have been adopted by the hospitality industry worldwide due to the dominance of American hotel chains:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" A ",{"type":"'''","value":["king bed"]}," is nearly square; it provides more than ample room for two people, maybe three if they're small or very friendly"]},{"type":"*","value":[" A ",{"type":"'''","value":["queen bed"]}," provides enough room for two adults to sleep comfortably"]},{"type":"*","value":[" A ",{"type":"'''","value":["full-size bed"]}," or ",{"type":"'''","value":["double bed"]}," is like a small queen; two people will find it slightly cramped, while a single person will find it quite roomy"]},{"type":"*","value":[" A ",{"type":"'''","value":["single bed"]}," or ",{"type":"'''","value":["twin bed"]}," is half the width of a king, only really suitable for one person"]},"\nSpecific dimensions of beds and mattresses can vary between countries (up to 20 cm, which is quite significant); in addition, the terminology used to denote them can be either wildly different or confusingly similar.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Connecting rooms "]},"\nSome hotels also have ",{"type":"'''","value":["connecting rooms"]},", which are separate units that can be connected with a door between them. Those can be useful for groups or families wanting to stay together with access to each other's room, but not sharing one. When not in use as such, they are often rented out as regular rooms with the connecting doors locked. A downside of staying in a connecting room is that noises from the other connecting room are sometimes more audible.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Suites "]},"\nSuites are sets of separate chambers rented by a hotel as a common accommodation unit. A suite would usually include one or more bedrooms and some other rooms, such as a living room or sitting room, sometimes with a sofa that converts into a bed. Dining, office and kitchen facilities are also added in many suites. Suites generally offer more space and furniture than a standard hotel room.\n\nA suite is usually provided as either a luxurious type of accommodation, one that enables more people (e.g. a family) to stay in a single unit, or one that provides for a more convenient extended stay. Often, these are marketed to businesspeople and convention delegates with the second room serving as a small office or meeting space.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Floors and views "]},"\nIn hotel buildings comprising several stories, rooms on upper floors are often deemed more attractive as they provide a better view, more privacy (less chance of anybody being able to glimpse into the room through the window from outside) and are farther away from any ground level noises. This especially applies to hotels in metropolitan areas, located at busy areas with heavy traffic, often in tall towers surrounded by other buildings. A reverse pattern applies to two-storey motels, where ground-floor tenants may park at the room and unload baggage directly instead of dragging luggage up a flight of stairs.\n\nIt is also possible that some rooms in a hotel have better or worse views than others; one side of an oceanfront lodge may face a beach while the other rooms face a road or highway. A landmark, skyline, landscape or striking vista may be visible from only part of the hotel; some rooms may also have less access to daylight, facing an internal courtyard or a wall of another building.\n\nRooms deemed better with regard to views or lighting may be offered at increased rates and require a specific booking.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Executive rooms, lounges and floors "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Ritz-Carlton Club lounge facing Marina Bay, The Ritz-Carlton Millenia Singapore - 20110928.jpg"],["300px"],["thumbnail"],["right"],["An executive lounge at a luxury hotel"]]},"\nSome of the more upscale hotels may offer special categories of rooms that provide access to a number of amenities contained within a lounge, often called ",{"type":"''","value":["executive"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["club lounge"]},", and hence the rooms or suites would also be denoted as ",{"type":"''","value":["executive"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["club"]},". Such lounges will often include both comfortable seating space, leisure amenities such as international TV, press and concierge service. It is common for a lounge to provide snacks and beverages at certain times or even throughout the day. All of the amenities available in the lounges are usually free of charge for guests with access to the lounges.\n\nFor convenience reasons, such lounges and rooms are often put on a separate floor or floors (named ",{"type":"''","value":["executive floors"]}," or similarly) with direct unrestricted access to the lounge, and the access to those floors is restricted to guests staying in those rooms only. Sometimes breakfasts for guests staying in such floors would be served at the lounge rather than in the area where other guests have breakfast. Lounges are often placed on higher floors of hotel buildings to provide better views.\n\nPlease note that naming of such facilities, their general availability, amenities available and mode of operation may vary, and a room denoted as ",{"type":"''","value":["executive"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["club"]}," might not provide access to a lounge like that. If you care for such amenities, it is best to consult the hotel's website or staff before booking.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Smoking \/ non-smoking "]},"\nHotels usually designate rooms as \"smoking\" and \"non-smoking\" (referring to tobacco\/cigarette\/cigar smoking) to enable non-smoking guests to enjoy rooms not tainted with the particular odours and other side effects of smoking. If either the absence of smoking residuals or the ability to smoke in the room is important to you, it is best to make sure your room is smoking or non-smoking while booking. If you believe you might have been assigned the incorrect type of room, contact the front desk of your hotel and ask to be moved to an appropriate category.\n\nMany modern hotels, however, do not condone smoking at all within the hotel property, not only because of higher demand for strictly non-smoking rooms, but also modern smoke detectors that can be activated by somebody smoking. Thus, smoking in your room is not advisable unless you expressly confirm with hotel staff that this is possible and will not trigger a smoke alarm.

In other cases they are pretty much arbitrary and meaningless.\n\nThat said, some concepts and formats have been quite uniformly adopted by the industry and can be found almost anywhere in the globe in the same form. Some of the popular and peculiar types of hotels are discussed below.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Full-service hotels "]},"\n\nA \"full-service hotel\" is an American term referring to a hotel providing extensive service to guests and generally staffed around the clock. Many of the services provided incur extra charges over the room rate, but it is their availability that is referred to as \"full service\". A full-service hotel will usually include a front desk and room service available 24 hours a day, an on-site restaurant with upscale cuisine and service, and some leisure facilities dependent on country and area standards (most often a fitness room and a swimming pool). Full-service hotels are usually relatively expensive, and their basic room rates rarely include anything but accommodation itself, with every additional service incurring comparably steep charges. On the other hand, rooms in full service hotels will usually feature many amenities not found in rooms in cheaper hotels.\n\nFull-service hotels will usually be rated as four- or five-star, or have a comparably high local rating. This category includes a broad range of facilities, from business-oriented international chain hotels to ultra-luxury boutique hotels.

Those American terms are not formally defined and used quite liberally, covering a broad range of facilities. In general, as the names suggest, those hotels will not offer some of the services and facilities full-service hotels provide (for example limited or no room service, or even no restaurant on premises), and the rooms in such hotels are simpler and have fewer amenities.\n\nPopular limited or select service hotel brands include:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["ibis Hotels"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Holiday Inn Express"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ramada"]}]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Economy or budget hotels "]},"\n\nProperties referred to as budget- or economy hotels are geared towards providing accommodation at the lowest possible price.

Airport hotels may be connected to an airport terminal or located off-site with shuttle service between the hotel and the airport.\n\nWhile airport hotels vary in standard of quality, many are part of international hotel chains. These often offer lower rates than a central downtown property of similar standard in a given chain due to their location. Airport hotel strips are constructed in suburbs, often with limited and complicated access to anything but the airport itself, and are prone to aircraft noise (although most airport hotels are sufficiently soundproofed). Airport hotels rarely provide especially desirable room views; serving a utilitarian function, they rarely enjoy the same level of investment in design and facilities as their city centre or resort counterparts. Hotel designers are also restricted in the height of buildings constructed in close proximity to runways and flight paths.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Extended-stay hotels \/ Aparthotels "]},"\n\nThose hotels are designed to cater for the needs of travellers staying over an extended period of time, anything from four nights to weeks or even months.

The differences are generally that an extended-stay property or aparthotel:\n# has been designed solely for the purpose, or converted to suit such purpose, while many rentable apartments are simply parts of regular residential buildings\n# contains only rentable rooms, there are no fixed tenants and usually no other uses of the buildings apart from rentable rooms, suites and apartments and common services for the guests\n# provide a certain level of shared services, depending on the exact standard of the property, which usually includes a front desk\/reception, housekeeping and some measure of on-site gastronomy\n\nThe differences between an extended-stay and regular hotel property usually include:\n# there is a broader selection of larger rooms and suites than in regular hotels which focus on smaller, single-bedroom units\n# rooms and suites usually include a kitchenette \/ food preparation area for travellers to cater for themselves (regardless of whether other gastronomy options are provided on site)\n\nSuch hotels are generally geared towards two groups of travellers. One includes business travellers who are away on business for extended periods of time but do not completely relocate from their permanent residence. Those properties are frequently found within or around cities that are business centres, and are often located next to central business districts, business parks or places a business traveller might want to be close to, as well as being well-connected to transportation infrastructure (road\/highway network, airports, railway stations). The other is geared toward leisure travellers wanting to spend a vacation in one place and cater for themselves partially or totally. They are most often found in leisure destinations and may contain fewer business-oriented facilities, while being more oriented towards the needs of travelling families.\n\nExamples of extended-stay hotel chains and brands are:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Residence Inn"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["TownePlace Suites"]}," from ",{"type":"'''","value":["Marriott"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Staybridge Suites"]}," from ",{"type":"'''","value":["InterContinental Hotels Group"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Homewood Suites by Hilton"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Home2 Suites by Hilton"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Adagio"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Suite Novotel"]}," from ",{"type":"'''","value":["Accor"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hyatt House"]}," (formerly known as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Summerfield Suites"]},")"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Boutique hotels "]},"\n\nThis term has become more popular in recent years and has been applied quite liberally by the hospitality industry thanks to its generally positive connotations and ability to enhance the status of a varying array of properties. The general concept is that a \"boutique hotel\" is a unique property, not one designed to fit a predetermined format or a brand, which is the case with most modern hotel chain properties. The other qualities often associated with the category are a certain degree of luxury as well as small size, but a traveller might find that a hotel referred to as \"boutique\" lacks either to some extent or completely.\n\nWhile boutique hotels were typically thought of as independent alternatives to chain hotels, the popularity of the concept and the demands of the modern hospitality markets have led both individual property operators to form or join some type of association or chain, and hotel operating companies to extend their portfolios by acquiring or creating boutique hotels themselves, often under a specifically created brand.\n\nBrands created by large hospitality companies created specifically to include boutique hotels include:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Luxury Collection"]}," by Starwood"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts"]}," by Hilton"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["MGallery"]}," by Accor"]},"Do note, however, that many properties operated under other upscale brands of those and other operators can also be deemed boutique hotels.

These hotels are generally similar in prices and level of service to the company's regular \"Ibis\" hotels, but vary wildly in terms of actual property characteristics, locations, and room sizes.

A capsule is basically only suitable for laying or sleeping in it, although some also include a television, an electronic console, and wireless internet connection for guests to relax or entertain themselves before going to sleep.\n\nCapsule hotels consist of multiple capsule units places side by side and stacked upon each other to maximize space utilization. Communal facilities are usually very limited and include shared washrooms and luggage lockers (as there is basically no room for luggage in a capsule), but sometimes also restaurants or vending machines.

Airport hotels will sometimes provide ",{"type":"'''","value":["shuttlebus"]}," services from the hotel to the air terminal at regular intervals.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Star ratings"]},"\nIn many countries of the world hotels feature a rating, reflecting their supposed standard. This rating is most frequently expressed in stars, with one star meaning the lowest standard, and five stars meaning the highest standard. In some countries, other systems are employed, such as letters or particular names. See our article on ",{"type":"[[","value":[["rating systems"]]}," for details.\n\nThe hotel rating is usually done by a state authority or industry organization in a given country, and is most often based on \"hard\" criteria that are clear and easy to appraise, such as whether the hotel has a given facility or service available. Therefore, hotel ratings will usually tell you whether the hotel has a swimming pool or room service, but not whether the rooms are truly comfortable or the personnel is friendly and courteous.\n\nIn some countries more than one classification is in use, e.g. when an external organization, such as an automobile club, uses their own rating. Wherever a star rating is not officially regulated, some properties may simply give themselves as star rating at will, e.g. some hotels in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dubai"]]}," refer to themselves as six- or seven-stars, implying they are even better than the five-star properties elsewhere in the world. There are also some global ratings, e.g. some hotel organizations like ",{"type":"''","value":["Leading Hotels of the World"]}," perform inspections at member and aspiring member properties against their own standards. Finally, package tour companies often give properties their own star or star-like ratings (e.g. by awarding them one to five \"suns\") in their catalogues.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Hotel chains "]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Brands, management and ownership "]},"\n\nA \"hotel chain\" is usually meant to represent a collection of hotels under the same brand, management or ownership. Similar expressions exist in other languages (e.g. \"Hotelkette\" in Germany, which is a direct analogue), while in some languages the reference to network is used. A hotel chain would usually use a specific brand which becomes a part of the name of every hotel in the chain, and has all the hotels follow a number of standards. Do note, however, that the amount of uniformity and standardization within hotel chains can vary, and a hotel chain may include very different properties of different standards under a common brand.\n\nWhile not of obvious to travellers it is worth noting that the hotel's brand does not imply its management or ownership. A hotel may be owned by a separate entity and operated by another, unrelated directly to the company providing the brand name by means of franchise agreement. Often hotel chains contain a mix of properties owned and operated by the \"mother company\", only managed by it and ones that are completely franchised out. For example, most Hilton hotels around the world are not owned, or even operated, by Hilton Worldwide.\n\nTherefore, three types of businesses evolved in conjunction with operating hotels:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Hotel chain operators, which often act as master franchisees providing brand concepts, names, standards and often management guidance to individual hotel operators. They may or may not assume the role of hotel management companies with all, some or none of the hotels within their chains, and often ."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Hotel management companies, which operate the hotel by employing the staff and using infrastructure to provide hotel services, collecting revenues and splitting them between themselves, the hotel chain operator \/ franchisor and the owner of the property"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Real estate holding companies, which own the hotel properties. This is often split between developers, who basically create hotels, building them from scratch or refurbishing existing buildings with the help and guidance of hotel chain operators and hotel management companies, and investment companies, who buy already operating hotel properties from developers. In some cases, the same franchisees may own multiple hotels with different brand affiliations for each."]},"\nSometimes a large hospitality company would have separate entities performing each of those roles, which may or may not cooperate on specific properties depending on circumstances and needs. Travellers are almost always only presented with the name of the hotel chain operator and\/or the specific brand and it may not be obvious who actually operates and owns the hotel. This may or may not be relevant, as in some chains owned and operated properties might be held to different standards from franchised properties.\n\nMany hotel chain operators choose to operate multiple hotel chains and brands to cater to a wider range of travellers by including properties in multiple price ranges; for instance, a property which does not meet the standards to be a Days Inn can be marketed by the same chain as a Knights Inn. A chain normally associated with full-service hotels can launch an \"express\" or \"econo\" marque under different branding to enter the economy limited service price range, where a hotel only has the most basic motel-like amenities, without undermining its core brand. This form of ",{"type":"''","value":["market segmentation"]}," often also serves as a means for franchisors to circumvent restrictions where a franchisee is contractually guaranteed a minimum distance between hotels or motels of the same franchised brand.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Hotel Loyalty Programs"]},"\nHotel Loyalty Programs are loyalty programmes operated by hotel chains, that are in many ways similar to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["frequent flyer programmes"]]},". The purpose of Hotel loyalty programs are to ensure that a hotel company retains its clients as frequent guests by offering benefits for staying as a guest or booking conference rooms and facilities at their hotels. The basic idea is every eligible hotel night or every dollar you spend at hotel brands participating in the corporate hotel loyalty program earns points, which can be exchanged for rewards like hotel rooms, room upgrades and airline miles. Hotel co-branded credit cards are a common strategy for earning hotel loyalty points and benefits when not staying at hotels.  \n\nAn additional incentive for a hotel frequent guest is premium membership. Each corporate hotel loyalty program has its own criteria for elite membership. Hotel loyalty program elite membership is generally earned by a frequent guest when certain thresholds are met for the number of hotel stays, hotel nights, or money spent.  A hotel stay is defined as consecutive nights at same hotel under same name, regardless of the number of different reservations.  \n\nElite membership in a hotel loyalty program is generally based on activity within a calendar year.  Sleep at the loyalty program member hotels for sufficient nights or stays, or spend enough money and you'll get a silver\/gold\/platinum\/diamond hotel program membership card entitling you to various perks, such as hotel points bonuses, lounge access, free upgrades, guaranteed rooms, etc.  High level elite membership in the major hotel chain loyalty programs, generally with the benefit of complimentary room upgrades, takes between 25 and 75 hotel nights in a 12-month period.\n\nSome hotel chains, particularly in the luxury segment, operate programs that do not award points, but offer frequent guest recognition with added value benefits such as complimentary room upgrades, restaurant and spa discounts, and additional amenities in recognition of the loyal guest.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["International chains"]},"\n\nInternational hotel chains are a popular choice with business travellers, as they generally offer standardized predictability. The downside for leisure travel is that they are rarely very exciting or exotic, and there can still be considerable variation within the brand.\n\nThe following lists major international hotel chains only, i.e. those with significant presence (~500 hotels or more) on all or almost all inhabited continents.
