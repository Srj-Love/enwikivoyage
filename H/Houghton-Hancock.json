Although separated by a canal, they are connected into a single community by a unique lift bridge.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nThe two main routes into Houghton and Hancock from the south are US-41 and M26.\n\nTravelers coming from Green Bay or the central or eastern Upper Peninsula will likely travel on US-41.  You'll know you've arrived because you'll suddenly find yourself surrounded by large modern university buildings, sprawling parking lots, and fraternity houses; you're on the campus of Michigan Tech.  Keep driving to reach downtown Houghton, where the architecture transforms into old red sandstone buildings lining the tightly-packed small town business district overlooking the canal.  US-41 then crosses the lift bridge into Hancock, which climbs the ridge on the north side of the channel.\n\nThose arriving from central Wisconsin, Minnesota, or the Western UP will take M26.  The first thing you will see will be the Walmart on the right, and an eroded cliff on the left.  Like US-41, M26 crosses the lift bridge.\n\nHoughton County Memorial Airport, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.houghtoncounty.org\/"]},", has a few flights each day from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chicago"]]}," although they tend to be fairly expensive.

Car rentals area available at the airport.  \n\nThe road names can be confusing as the same road can have different names in different areas.
