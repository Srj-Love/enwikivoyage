You will find a sign pointing to the road and another one after 100 meters or so, pointing towards north, a path goes a part of the way, but you must go a bit further on the grassy field in order to see the two stone piles, where the grave is said to be. There is not much to see of the tomb, only two piles of stone, but the story is interesting and the view is great up there. You can continue, go back to the former main road in Hovsegg, follow the road until you see the curious basaltformations. Somewhere they go zig-zag and somewhere they are like columns. They get most visible next to the road just before the road turns around the mountain.
