A closed town means that foreign visitors are not allowed to travel to or through the town without first getting a permit from the Aliens Entry and Exit Administration (AEEA) office of the PSB station in the town from which they will be traveling to the closed town.\n\nGetting an Alien Travel Permit (ATP) is usually a straightforward process. All cities and most towns of any size have an AEEA office inside a central PSB (public security bureau or police) station. The AEEA office is also where you would go to get your visa extended. \n\nThe AEEA officers are usually friendly and usually know a bit of English. Let the AEEA officer know you want to go to Huatugou on your way to Xinjiang. An ATP costs Y50 . You get a folded form about the size of your passport;The permitted destinations written inside in Chinese only.\n\nIn Golmud, the bus station will not sell you a ticket to Huatugou unless you have an ATP. Similarly, the bus station in Dunhuang will not sell you a ticket to Huatugou unless you have an ATP. (Dunhuang is not itself a closed town, but the route to Dunhuang goes through a number of closed towns.) Some travelers have reported success in flagging down the bus just after it left the station and paying the fare on board without having a permit. There are several checkpoints on route, but travelers report that buses are rarely stopped.\n\nLodging staff in closed towns are required to report foreign guests. This seems to be generally overlooked in a transit hub like Huatugou, but you'll likely be reported if you stay in any other town in the area or if you stay in Huatugou for more than a day. If an official finds someone without a permit, travelers report they usually claim ignorance of the rules and are usually scolded and then restricted to their lodging and closely watched by hotel staff until they get on the next bus out of town. If your are belligerent with the officer, or if s\/he has had a bad day for some other reason, you may be required to take a bus back in the direction from which you came.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nthe bus station is in the main road\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["Bus from Golmud - takes 6-7 hours , departs from golmud at 12:00 , foreigners need an Alien Travel Permit that you can get in the psb "]},{"type":"*","value":["Bus from Dunhuang - there is a bus from Dunhuang - but, the bus station in Dunhuang will not sell you a ticket to Huatugou unless you have an ATP,  You can't get this permit in Dunhuang because its in onther province, so you have to"]},"do the ride to the psb in golmud, and from there to take the bus to Huatugou.
