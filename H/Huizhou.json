Some 40 miles north of Shenzhen, in verdant, tropical countryside, a common reaction is \"Where did this place come from?\" Until comparatively recently (the 1980's) Huizhou was a sleepy Guangdong town on the Pearl River Delta. It has since exploded with industry, attracting investment from Japanese, Korean, European and American companies. It is one of the most architecturally pleasing small cities in all of Guangdong, and one of the very richest. CIA reports citing it as the de-facto HQ for all organized crime in Hong Kong and Guangdong may go some way to explaining the many sumptuous housing developments here, as well as the plethora of Porsches, five-star hotels and other indicators of high-end living. Huizhou is where the triad crime bosses come to dialogue and chill. Something of an anomaly within mainland China, this is a city that answers to no-one and those who live here have definite reasons for doing so.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]}," \nHuizhou is well served by highways linking it with Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Hong Kong is just a forty-minute bus ride away. The city has its own railway station linking it with many cities around China.There are plans afoot to link Huizhou by high-speed underground train with Shenzhen, which will effectively provide the city with a rapid-transit link to downtown Hong Kong.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Via Shenzhen"]},"\n\nIf you get off the plane from Shenzhen airport, you can get here by Intercity Bus",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.airport-china.com\/shenzhen-baoan-airport\/traffic\/intercity-bus.html"]},".

Taxis are everywhere. Flagfall for regular taxis is 5RMB (about 1 US dollar) or for the more opulent Kande Hotel Taxis which operate throughout the city, 8RMB.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]}," \nThe beautiful, seventeenth century West Lake, complete with pagoda and gardens.\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Golden Bay (Xun Liao Wan)"],["alt=金海湾（巽竂湾）"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Bay ( Sunda Liao Bay ) is located in Huidong County Ping Town South, is located south of the Tropic of cancer, the South China Sea in the east of Dayawan, Banghai mountain, hill sea facies block, Haitian blend."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Beach Spa"],["alt=海滨温泉"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=The hot springs recreation area to the marine culture as the theme, more than 72 kinds of size, function is an open-air hot spring pool, dotted in the coastal garden : a warm and romantic couples pool house; there are all kinds of fitness adjustable feeding health spa, in the health area of sea turtles in the stomach bubble Long Quan, also can hide in the big gourd enjoy traditional Chinese medicine bath, also can be in the big pot enjoy tea bath; and the spa area is more popular, is the good place with beauty."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]}," \nHuizhou has no shortage of Japanese and western restaurants.
