With a population of nearly 8,000 Humahuaca is sited along the banks of the Rio Grande at 3,000 meters above sea level. \n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:HumahuacaCityHall.jpg"],["thumb"],["city hall"]]},"\n\nThe Quebrada de Humahuaca was the first part of Argentina to be explored and settled by the Spaniards, for it provided a connecting route to the more temperate regions further south around Salta and Cordoba where supplies of food and draft animals could be found for the silver mines at Potosi, the gold mines at Oruro and other mining settlements in Upper Peru, now Bolivia. The town was a stopping place along that route before beginning the difficult climb to the Altiplano. Later Humahuaca was a central place for the revolutionary activity that eventually led to the creation of modern Argentina. Humahuaca was also a station on the now defunct railway that connected Bolivia to Buenos Aires, and its wild west aspect will remind many North Americans of some of the towns of Arizona or New Mexico. A dusty ranching center surrounded by acres of cactus and spectacularly colorful mountains, Humahuaca looks like it should be a set for a wild west movie.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nMost buses between Jujuy and the town of La Quiaca on the Bolivian border stop at Humahuaca, and through buses to and from Salta are also available at the small and fairly informal bus station a few blocks SW of the center of town. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe town is too small for any transport other than walking to be necessary.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:HumahuacaChurch.jpg"],["thumb"],["church"]]},"\n\nHumahuaca is dominated by the Monumento de la Independencia crowning a small rise just west of the center and reached by climbing a long  flight of steps. At the top there is a nice view of the Rio Grande valley and the town center not marred by the statue. There is also an adobe belfry and several cactus plants, perhaps the most photographed site in northern Argentina.\n\nThe central plaza is bordered to its west by the lovely small Iglesia de la Candalaria y San Antonio, a colonial era foundation with an altarpiece dating to the late 17th century. Despite its small size, the church is a cathedral, one of the smallest churches to serve that function.\n\nThe center of the town is an attractively whitewashed Spanish colonial area. The church, now a cathedral, is well worth a visit.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Serran√≠a del Hornocal"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Serrania del Hornocal is a viewpoint for a colorful rock formation.
