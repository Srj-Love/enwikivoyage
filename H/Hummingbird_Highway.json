Completely paved along its 49 mile length, the highway is a short and easy drive with opportunities for short hikes and swims along the way. Almost anyone who drives from Belize City or the Cayo District to the south (Dangriga, Hopkins, Placencia, or Punta Gorda) will use this highway (there is an alternative coastal route from Belize City but the road is terrible) and it is worth factoring in a few hours extra to stop along this highway for hiking, swimming or caving.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Prepare"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Attractions"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Blue Hole National Park"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Barquidier Waterfall"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Kropf's Bakery"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Casita de Amour"]}]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["related"],["Belize"]]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]}," \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]}," \n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineitinerary"]]}]
