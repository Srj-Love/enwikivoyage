The rown itself is a very short deviation off the main road, and has a general store, pub, cafe.  Reasonable spot to stop for a lunch, supplies or a beer.  Not much in the town itself.  Don't overestimate its size by the font on the map.  It is close to several national attractions.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nAlong the Arnham Highway, less than an one hour drive from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Darwin"]]},".

Not far from Humpty Doo, you can drive along a narrow road across the dam, to several bird hides.  The diversity of birdlife is quite amazing, even for those who are not avid birdwatchers.  Make sure you take your best camera for some excellent shots, including a telscopic lens if you have one.  4-wheel drive is not required.
