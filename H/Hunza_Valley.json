The mountain dominates the Hunza Valley west of K2, its steep ice-covered peak towering above barren cliffs and terraces.

Tradition relates that Mayroo Khan, apparently the first Muslim Thum ofNagar some 200 years after the introduction of the religion of Islam to Gilgit, married a daughter of Trakhan of Gilgit, who bore him twin sons named Moghlot and Girkis. From the former the present ruling family of Nager is descended. The twins are said to have shown hostility to one another from birth. Their father seeing this and unable to settle the question of succession, divided his state between them, giving to Girkis the north, and to Moghlot the south, bank of the river. \nThe visitors to Hunza are overwhelmed by the rugged charm, the fragrant breeze singing through graceful poplar trees and the velvet-like green carpet of wheat fields, set against the background of snow-covered mountains.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nVia the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Karakoram Highway"]]},".\n\nHunza is just 100 KM drive from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gilgit"]]},", and most people arrive by road and it takes almost 2 - 3 Hours to reach Hunza from Gilgit.
