It is sometimes called the world's most beautiful sea voyage. One should be aware that the Hurtigruten mainly travels along the very coast, largely sheltered by islands and skerries, the ships does not however cruise the famous fjords of West Norway. It is basically a trip to see the coast, not the fjords. During the summer season the Hurtigruten does a detour to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Geiranger"]]},". In addition, the ship regularly calls at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Molde"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Trondheim"]]},", both cities sits on the shores of major fjords.\n\nOriginally, Hurtigruten was used as a means of transportation for passengers, goods and mail along the coast of Norway. The ships still transport a limited amount of cargo, but today the ships resemble cruise ships more closely than the original coastal steamers.\n\nThe voyage is a simple way of combining lodging, eating, and transportation. Unlike many other cruise ferries, Hurtigruten is not a place for drinking and partying. A one way travel takes 6-7 days, while the round-trip takes 12. This contrasts Norway-in-a-Nutshell tours which are 1-3 days. It's also possible to purchase off-&-on tickets. Port stops vary in length. They can be as short as 5 minutes and up to 5-6 hours. \n\nA museum, including parts and one whole, prior versions of the ship Finnmarken, sits in one port, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Stokmarknes"]]},", which explains the history of the line.\n\nSome ports' livelihood revolve around the daily arrival and departure of these ships (at all hours of day and night).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Prepare"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Hurtigruten - Bergen, Norway.jpg"],["thumb"],["The Trollfjord, a 16K ton class Hurtigruten ship at dock in Bergen"]]},"\nHurtigruten is quite expensive; a full round trip from Bergen to Kirkenes and back will at cheapest cost almost 10 000 Norwegian kroner\/person (€ 1200, US$1600) in the lowest season in a cabin with shared bathroom and without window. The per person price means that there will be many passengers in your party; if you're using the cabin yourself it costs more. If you're traveling in the summer season the price will be doubled, if you want a \"nicer\" cabin with window, add an additional 30-100% to the price. The best suite in the middle of the summer costs 72000 kr\/person. On the upside, the ships are very clean and anti-social behavior, noise etc. are practically non existent on board. \n\nHowever it is possible to join the voyage only for part of the voyage. The cost for a such voyage is calculated partly for the distances traveled, and for the cabins. If you would like to cut the cost. This can therefore be done by only traveling during daytime, or stay onboard only one night. Most ships are capable of carrying cars (typically 40-50, excepting the two oldest ships). This could make possibilities for an interesting round-trip.\n\nThe dress code on the ship is casual, but remember to bring ",{"type":"'''","value":["warm clothes"]}," if you want to walk on the deck.
