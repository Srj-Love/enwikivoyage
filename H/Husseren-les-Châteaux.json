The small streets, the church (its statue of Saint Pancrace XIV and its Rinkenback org from 1890) and the typical half-timbered houses constitute a nice little walk ending in the vineyards or the forest, it all offering a splendid panoramic view on the Alsatian vineyard, open country and the Black Forest.\n\nHusseren-les-Châteaux is named after the ruins of the castles on the top of the mountain.
