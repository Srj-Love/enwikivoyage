It was formerly known as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Butare"]}," and many maps and official documents still refer to Butare.  Huye is the capital of Huye district, which was again Butare district prior to its dissolution in 2006.  It is said to have about 80,000 inhabitants. It is famous for hosting the National University, the National Museum (unique in Africa) and being near to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nyanza"]]},", where the palace of the former king (the so-called mwami) is.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThere are several minibus companies make their way from Kigali to Huye. One of them recommended is Volcano. It easy to find in the Kigali Domestic bus station. The fee is 2500 RFr one way.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nHuye has plenty of taxis, motorcycle taxis, and bicycle taxis, all of which will be eager to serve you.  Also, you can walk from the northernmost part of Huye (the bus station) to the southernmost (the University of Rwanda) in about 20 minutes.  (The taxis exist mainly to take Rwandans to their homes farther outside the city).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["National Museum of Rwanda"]},": The National Museum is a surprisingly comprehensive and interesting museum.  Even travellers knowledgeable about recent Rwandan history will learn much about Rwanda's colonial and post-colonial governments, as well as the Tutsi monarchy which pre-dated both of these.  Many of Rwanda's idiosyncratic cultural attributes will make more sense after a visit to the national museum."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Gikongoro Genocide memorial"]},": Just outside Huye is one of the most compelling genocide memorials in Rwanda.  The memorial is located in Gikongoro, which is about 15 minutes east of Huye along the road to Cyangugu; taxis will take you there from Huye for about $15.  In 1994, Gikongoro was the site of a large massacre at a vocational school where several hundred Tutsis were hiding.  Local guides (some of whom have firsthand knowledge of the events that transpired there) will tell you the story of what happened there."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Huye Market"]},": Huye has a bustling market that is open every day except Saturday.  Although there will be no souvenirs on sale, this market is an excellent way to learn how Rwandans shop for their everyday needs.  Be prepared to barter.

Students here are almost all on full scholarship, selected by test performance; they sleep two to a bed in dorms located on campus."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nThe most reliable restaurant in Huye is the restaurant at the Hotel Ibis on the main street.  However, much of the Ibis's fare is Belgian instead of Rwandan.  For Rwandan fare, try the Restaurant Macrobiotique, which is located on the same side of the main road as the Hotel Ibis, but farther towards the university. It is a popular place for students to take their meals.  \n\nFor lunch, try the nameless lunch restaurant located across the street from the Ibis and a little to the right (as you face away from Ibis).  It is to the right of the craft store.  For lunch they offer classic Rwandan comfort food: brochettes (goat kabobs), plantains, sweet potatoes, boiled cassava, beans, and rice.  It is excellent.\n\nAccording to local people several years ago the government passed a law requiring that all government employees only had 30 minutes for lunch each day, this lead to the creation of lunch buffets across Rwanda that allowed for these workers to fill up on food and get back to the office in time. For one of these ubiquitous buffets head across the street from Hotel Ibis and to the left (towards NUR). The floor above Matar Supermarket has a popular lunch restaurant. The menu changes depending on the day, but usually you can find rice, potatoes, sombe (kassava leaves), pasta, salad, and meat. If you do not eat meat your meal is cheaper, and the price rises depending on which meat you choose beef => fish => chicken. You can grab more vegetarian food once you are finished, but have to pay more for meat. The door is around the side to the left of Matar.\n\nFor a quick snack or reasonably priced western food you can either eat at the bakery in Matar Supermarket, where they serve sambusas, mini-pizzas, cakes and other snacks. Or there is a small cafe which serves western food such as pasta, burritos and burgers as well as coffee and tea. The owners are also friendly and helpful, and speak fluent English and French.\n\nIf you walk towards the University you will find Hotel Credo on the left side, they have a swimming pool and a restaurant of course. Opposite of this hotel there is the ice cream parlour Nzozi Nziza where you can get ice cream, very nice cakes and cookies.\n\nAn excellent place for dinner is the Chinese restaurant located across the street from the market, behind the gas station.  Chinese workers built most of the paved roads in Rwanda, and a few Chinese restaurants survived their departure.  This one serves a variety of chicken, pork, vegetarian, and beef dishes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nThere is a nameless dance club in Huye that is open on Friday and Saturday nights.  It is located on the right side of the road which leads to the market from the main road (a quick inquiry at the Hotel Ibis can yield more specific directions).  The club serves beer and liquor.\n\nBasically every restaurant in Huye is also a bar, in hotel Faucon also on the main road, towards Kigali if you leave from Ibis there is a bar with tv specialized on football (soccer) and on Fridays and Saturdays they have a disco. \n\nIf you travel the main road towards the University just after you left town and you go down hill there is Cafe Connexion on your right side, you can drink the best cappucino served in Rwanda there and you can buy the coffee in the shop. Inside you will see the equipment they use to make this excellent coffee.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nBy far the best hotel in Huye is the Hotel Ibis, which has been a Huye (Butare) landmark since the 1940s.  Run by a Belgian family for several decades, the Ibis is the only hotel in Huye that has a reliable restaurant open every day of the week, as well as hot water and electricity virtually 24\/7.  A large patio with outdoor seating is ideal for consumption of Mutzig or Primus (popular beers in Rwanda) or the occasional sorghum beer.\n\nOf course, one popular strategy is to stay at another (cheaper) hotel and eat at the Ibis restaurant, which is open to everyone.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Shalom House"],["url="],["email=hmarieclaire@yahoo.fr"],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Near the university old rectory"],["phone=+250 05125041"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["phoneextra=+250 55109819"],["content=8 en-suite rooms. spotlessly clean. lounge for guests. dining room for simple meals.
