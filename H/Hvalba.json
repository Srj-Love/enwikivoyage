There are two villages around the bay of Hvalba: Nes is on the southern side of the fjord and Hvalba is at the bottom of the bay and on the northern side. Hvalba was once the largest village in Suðuroy. The area is not larger than one can go by feet around in the village or to the two isthmuses Hvalbiareiði (also called Fiskieiði) and Norðbergseiði (also called Á Drátti). These two places are both on the west coast of the island while Hvalba village is on the east coast. The island is almost divided into two in Hvalba. You can also go hiking trips up in the mountains around the village. If you have a car it is easier and faster to get around in Hvalba and to other places, but the distances are not that big inside the village. \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Taxi and busses in Suðuroy:"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Phone: 506888, Taxi and Bus, Kartni Fornagarð, Taxi for 6 persons and minibus for 16 persons."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Phone: 227228, AH Taxi, Trongisvágur.
