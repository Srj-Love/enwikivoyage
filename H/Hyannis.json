The busses run every hour or so.\n\nOnce on the cape there is another option. The Cape Cod Regional Transit Authority as few viable options. The H20 bus--goes from Hyannis to Orleans and traveling down Route 28. It takes about an hour and half from start to stop, but this is also doable. In Harwich you can catch the FLEX bus that takes you to Proviencetown.\n\nThe Sealine Bus route goes west bound from Hyannis, along Route 28, until you get to Woods Hole. (Where besides a few attractions is another point to catch a ferry to Woods Hole).\n\nThe Barnstable Villeger is a shuttle that goes around Hyannis. It is mainly used by locals.  There is also something called the b-Bus which is for residents only (Year Round or Seasonal) but is basically a bus that will pick you up at your house or apartment--it is too complicated to explain here but you can visit the Cape Cod Regional Transit website.\n\nThe fare for all these buses is about 1-2 dollars each way.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By Ferry "]},"\n\nHyannis is the main terminal point for ferrys to Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard. \n\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By Air "]},"\ncapeair.com\n\n\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By taxi "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Hyannis Taxi"]},", 45 Plant Rd, +1 508 775-0400."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Town Taxi Of Cape Cod"]},",  436 Yarmouth Rd,  +1 508 771-5555."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["John F.
