In its heyday Hyder was filled with saloons, ladies of the evening, gambling and all manner of other sin because it was just across the border and therefore out of reach of the Canadian Mounties and a long way from any American law enforcement presence.\n\nThe portion of Hyder built over the water and abandoned as mining activity declined burned down in 1948. Today the town is now only about one block long and it and starts right at the unguarded American border. Therefore, Hyder represents an unusual opportunity for travelers to visit ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alaska"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["USA"]]}," legally without a US visa.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Canada"]]},", however, does guard the border and visitors with inadequate Canadian visas or passports often get temporarily stuck in Hyder until they can get the right immigration documents.  If you are visiting Canada on a single entry visa do not go to Hyder (or elsewhere in Alaska) as you may not be allowed back into Canada without getting a new visa.\n\nAs the easternmost town in Alaska and the closest and most accessible point in Alaska by road to the Lower 48 States, Hyder is a popular place to \"collect\" Alaska as a travel destination.\n\nHyder is notable for being the only place in Alaska not to use the +1-907 area code, instead using ",{"type":"[[","value":[["British Columbia"]]},"'s +1-250 area code. Unlike the rest of Alaska, Hyder unofficially uses the Pacific Time Zone like most of British Columbia and the US West Coast States. The preferred currency is Canadian (except the U.S. Post Office, which insists on American currency). Hyder's nearly 100 residents observe Canadian holidays, send their children to a Canadian school, and if they call the police will find that a Canadian Mountie will respond. BC Hydro supplies the electricity from Canada. Hyder and Stewart share a mutual international Chamber of Commerce.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nHyder is located at the head of the Portland Canal, a 130-mile (210 km) long fjord which forms a portion of the border between the U.S. and Canada at the southeastern edge of the Alaska Panhandle. Portland Canal is the second longest fjord on Earth.\n\nOther than via a private boat or float plane, the only way to get to Hyder is by road via ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Stewart"]]},", BC which is 2 miles (3 km).
