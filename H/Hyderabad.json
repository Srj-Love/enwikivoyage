The city and district of Hyderabad are coterminous. Hyderabad district is entirely contained within the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ranga Reddy"]]}," district of Andhra Pradesh. Many of the suburbs of Hyderabad were recently merged into the city, now called Greater Hyderabad.\n\nThis city, also called ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bhagyanagaram,"]}," was kept by Quli Qutb Shah, the 16th century ruler of Hyderabad, in the name of his lover Bhagmathi.\n\nA city rich with history and tradition, Hyderabad now competes with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bangalore"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chennai"]]}," for the crown of India's IT capital; Microsoft and Google have their India headquarters here.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nIf you are traveling to Hyderabad on business—as is increasingly the case now—it is easy to miss the 400 year-old Hyderabad. The city that immediately hits the eye is a sprawling metropolis of shopping malls and office buildings with glass facades. The whole of the city seems to be under construction or renovation and the roads are jammed because flyovers are being constructed. It is a magnificent city in many senses.\n\nThe \"old city\" that was once the seat of the Nizam, the ruler of the largest and the most opulent \"princely state\", and the twin city of Secunderabad where the British maintained a cantonment to keep the army within striking distance of the Nizam can be seen only if you take the time out to see them.\n\nHyderabad's many epithets include the ",{"type":"'''","value":["City of Pearls"]},", the ",{"type":"'''","value":["City of Nawabs"]},", the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Biryani City"]}," and, because of its high-tech draw, ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cyberabad"]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["image:golconda-1.jpg"],["right"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Golconda Fort"]]},"\nIn 1463 ",{"type":"'''","value":["Quli Qutb-ul-Mulk"]}," established the fortress of Golconda about 8 km to the west of Hyderabad’s present day old city.

By 1518, he had become independent from the Bahmani sultan, declared himself the Sultan under the name of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Quli Qutb Shah"]}," and established the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Qutb Shahi dynasty"]},". In 1589, ",{"type":"'''","value":["Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah"]},", a grandson of Quli Qutb Shah, made the decision to move his capital from the Golconda fort to the present day location of Hyderabad due to water shortages at the old location. In 1591, he ordered the construction of the Charminar, reportedly in gratitude to Allah for cutting short a plague epidemic before it could do too much damage.\n\nThe name \"Hyderabad\" reportedly had its origins in an affair between Mohammad Quli Qutb Shah and a local Telugu courtesan named Bhagmati. He named the city ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bhagyanagar"]}," after her, and after she converted to Islam and took on the name of \"Hyder Mahal\", he named the city Hyderabad. Hyderabad was built on a ",{"type":"'''","value":["grid plan"]}," with help from Iranian architects. French traveler Jean-Baptiste Tavernier favorably compared Hyderabad to Orleans.\n\nThe Qutb Shahi dynasty lasted till 1687, when the Mughal emperor ",{"type":"'''","value":["Aurangzeb"]}," defeated the sultanate and took over Hyderabad. He appointed his governor as ruler of the region and granted him the title of Nizam-ul-Mulk. However, Mughal rule was short-lived and in 1724, the Nizam ",{"type":"'''","value":["Asaf Jah I"]}," gained independence from a declining Mughal empire. Legend has it that while on a hunting expedition, he met a holy man who offered him some ",{"type":"''","value":["kulchas"]}," and asked him to eat as much as he could. Asaf Jah ate only seven, and the holy man prophesied that his dynasty would last for seven generations. Sure enough, the seventh ruler in the dynasty was the last.

Hyderabad state became a \"princely state\", protected by, and under the overlordship of the British. The British maintained their army in nearby Secunderabad to protect the Nizam and to ensure that he did not do any mischief. Hyderabad state was the richest in the country and in the 1930s Time magazine rated the Nizam the richest man in the world. In 1947, with India's independence, the seventh Nizam was reluctant to cede his principality to the newly independent India, preferring Pakistan instead. India sent in its troops and the 200 year old prophesy was fulfilled. On September 17th 1948, it was merged in to India. Hyderabad become the capital city of Hyderabad state till nov 1st 1956.

The new capital's administrative buildings were located around ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hussain Sagar Lake"]},", approximately between Secunderabad and the \"old city\", as the Nizam's city came to be called.\n\nIn 1995, Chandrababu Naidu became chief minister of Andhra Pradesh. Among his key policies was a major initiative to turn the city into an IT hub. He cleaned up the streets, laid out IT parks and did much to attract technology companies into the city. Today, as Bangalore’s infrastructure is choked by the city’s rapid growth, Hyderabad's well-laid out streets are proving to be a major attraction for software and IT-enabled companies. The technology enclave of Madhapur has actually been officially named ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hi tec"]}," city, and \"Cyberabad\" is commonly used as an alternative name to Hyderabad.\n\nIn 2007, the suburbs of Hyderabad were merged with the city to form ",{"type":"'''","value":["Greater Hyderabad"]},". In 2009, the longstanding demand to have ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Telangana"]]}," created as a separate state came to boil, with low intensity agitations and disturbances shaking up Hyderabad.

The city has a culture that is distinct from the rest of Andhra Pradesh, showing Islamic influences and a courtly presence imparted from its period as the capital of the Nizamate. This is more evident in the old city. The new city resembles many provincial state capitals in India. Secunderabad is more cosmopolitan, as the Cantonment area is located in this part of the city.\n\nDue to a recent influx of young men and women from various parts of the country, Hyderabad's culture and attitudes have taken a turn towards \"modernity\". However, it is good to keep in mind that the city is still a deeply conservative place and to dress appropriately, especially in the old city.\n\nNote that people have a very indifferent attitude towards time and a very laid back attitude.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nLike many Indian cities Hyderabad has a tropical climate.

Highs can reach 45°C (113°F) or more and lack of air-conditioning can make it feel very uncomfortable.

The Old City is composed of a maze of disorienting alleyways that expand outward from the Charminar. Getting lost in the markets (where you can buy anything from hand-sequined saris to freshly slaughtered goats) and alleyways in the Old City  can make for a thoroughly enjoyable afternoon. The famous Chudi Bazaar (Lad Bazaar) across from the Charminar is a chaotic tumble of goods, people, animals and vehicles are navigated quickly on foot. The Chowmahalla palace and the Mecca Masjid are both easily accessed from the Charminar. Necklace Road, Sultan Bazar (Koti) and Abids are worth taking some time to wander around. Please note that walking can be hazardous in Hyderabad. It is common for roads to be missing pavement, or simply unpaved, and bikes and auto-rickshaws may go to right up to the edge of the road and climb any barrier to get ahead in traffic. Walking alongside and crossing the road can be very dangerous and it is important to stay alert for erratic driving.

Quality and variety of food, however, has not kept pace. There is a disproportionately large number of restaurants that aspire to be called \"fine-dining\" restaurants, but the food they serve is usually indifferent. In general, keep away from restaurants that call themselves \"multi-cuisine\" or if you see multiple cuisines on the menu, as the chances are that they are attempting to serve every kind of palate and will not satisfy any.\n\nThe older areas of Hyderabad are better places to find good and cheap food. Places close to Hi tec city, such as Madhapur and Kondapur, tend to have expensive and bad food, while in Banjara Hills and Jubilee Hills you will find restaurants that are expensive, but which sometimes serve good food. Those misled by the fact that Hyderabad is in South India and expecting South Indian food may be disappointed.

However, because the city sprawls so much, you need to be careful about the hotel location if you want to avoid a long commute and traffic bottlenecks.\n\nPlentiful budget accommodation is to be found around the Nampally railway station and in Abids, Koti and other new city areas for a few hundred rupees a day, and tourist attractions aren't very far off. However the facilities tend to be basic, the towels aren't necessarily clean and air-conditioning tends to be extra. It might make sense to pay a little more and choose mid-range accommodation. The area around Hussain Sagar Lake, Begumpet, Punjagutta, Somajiguda, Banjara Hills  and Lakdi-ka-Pul are close to both tourist attractions of the old city and the business areas of the new city.

It was common for the police to impose a curfew in that area while the rest of the city went about life without any problems. The old city continues to be at the heart of Hyderabad's crime wave and though many tourist attractions including Charminar are in this area, it is best to avoid late night visits.\n\nSince 2009, a political movement to carve out ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Telangana"]]}," into a separate state has started afresh. The issue at stake is not only whether the state should form, but also the political status of Hyderabad city itself, because Hyderabad is smack in the middle of Telangana, and supporters of statehood demand that the city be made its capital, while the proponents of a united Andhra Pradesh are unwilling to let go of their state capital even if they agree to their state being broken into two. The agitations from partisans on both sides of the issue have spilt into the streets, and shutdowns of the city (called \"bandhs\") have become moderately common. Violence is rare, and never affects travellers, but your ability to travel, shop or obtain services of any kinds may be affected. Keep an eye on Telangana-related news if you plan to travel to Hyderabad, because these agitations tend to erupt whenever one of the committees set up to study the report submits its report, or any scheduled political announcement takes place.\n\nOutside of these, Hyderabad is a rather safe metropolis. Muggings and violent crime are uncommon, most crime involves thefts. Avoid staying out late at night, especially if you are a woman.\n\nThe usual tourist-oriented scams in India are not as bad in Hyderabad as they are in other places.  However, foreigners will be hounded for money at tourist sites like the old city.  Just ignore the beggars and they will go away.\n\nRecently chain snatchings have become common in the city.
