Hyderabad, which formerly remained the capital of Sindh for many centuries was used to be known as the ",{"type":"''","value":["Paris of India"]},", due to belief that streets of the city were washed every morning with clean drinking water from River Indus before partition of the Indian subcontinent. Hyderabad is now the important commercial and cultural center of the Sindh and serves as a transit between the rural and the urban Sindh. Noteworthy antiquities of Hyderabad consists of the royal and impressive tombs of the Kalhora and Talpur rulers to miles long bustling and colourful narrow lanes of centuries old traditional Shahi Bazaar.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nHyderabad early history dates back to a small fishing village known as Neroon Kot, named after its local Sindhi ruler named Neroon on the banks of mighty River Indus. Later In AD 711, Muhammad bin Qasim along with his army conquered the Sindh and so the town of Hyderabad. After a brief rule of Muslim, Sindh came under the rule of local Somroos, who were local Sindhis converted to Islam. \n\nLater, Hyderabad was founded in 1768 by Kalhora dynasty chief Mian Ghulam Shah Kalhoro upon the ruins of Neroon Kot and the city was made capital of Sindh and its started to expand, progressed and flourished and obtained the nickname of ",{"type":"''","value":["Heart of the Mehran"]}," as the Kalhora ruler Mian Ghulam Shah was said to have fallen in love with the city. After the death of the last Kalhoro ruler, the Talpur dynasty conquered the region. The city expanded, progressed and flourished more under the Talpur rulers. The Talpur rule lasted almost over 50 years and in 1843, Talpurs faced a greater threat from the British forces due to the invasion of expanding British colonial empire. The British came face-to-face with the Talpurs at the Battle of Miani on 17 February 1843 under the command of General Napier who was firmly determined in conquering Sindh and plundering Hyderabad. The battle ended on 24 March 1843 when the Talpur Amirs lost and the city came into the hands of the British and thus the city was made the part of the Bombay Presidency of British colonial empire.\n\nAfter the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India while the Muslims refugees from India were settled in refugee camps in Hyderabad. Nearly all Hindus of Hyderabad left for India due to better socio-economic prospects in India. The massive migration of Muhajirs into Pakistan after the independence of Pakistan in 1947 raised the population levels of the city to an extreme. The late 1980s saw a black period in the history of Hyderabad as riots and violence broke out between the Muhajirs and Sindhi nationalist parties due to which the social fabric of the city was damaged. Until 1955 the city of Hyderabad served as the capital of Sindh province, which was later dissolved and Karachi was made the capital of Sindh.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh =   25.6"],["febhigh =   26.4"],["marhigh =   28.8"],["aprhigh =   30.6"],["mayhigh =   32.3"],["junhigh =   33.3"],["julhigh =   32.2"],["aughigh =   30.8"],["sephigh =   30.7"],["octhigh =   31.6"],["novhigh =   30.5"],["dechigh =   27.3"],["janlow =   14.1"],["feblow =   15.9"],["marlow =   20.3"],["aprlow =   23.7"],["maylow =   26.1"],["junlow =   27.9"],["jullow =   27.4"],["auglow =   26.2"],["seplow =   25.3"],["octlow =   23.5"],["novlow =   20.0"],["declow =   15.7"],["description = Check ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hyderabad's weather forecast"]}," at ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/weather\/1176734 BBC Weather"]}]]},"\nHyderabad has a relatively  hot desert climate climate pretty much throughout the year. Hyderabad has two main seasons; summer and winter, while spring and autumn are very short. The period from mid-April to late June is the hottest time of the year as temperate rises to as high as 48.5 °C whereas winters are usually warm and so best time to visit the city. Temperate remains around 25 °C  during day time and often drop below 10 °C at night.

This train runs daily non-stop between Lahore and Karachi and is faster than other trains, taking less than 20 hours travel time, because it makes only a few stops, whereas other trains make stops at every major station along the route and are usually delayed as well. The Karakoram Express has both economy and air-con class accommodation. A ticket (berth) on the Karakoram Express in air-con class will cost not more than Rs 5,000.\n\nOther than that, plenty of trains (both economy and air-conditioned class) run from Lahore as well other major big cities such as Peshawar, Faisalabad, Multan, Qetta, and Rawalpindi on a daily basis but expect them to be slower as they make stops at every railway station along the way. Tezgam or Shalimar Express have air-conditioned class so are best preferred for travellers from Punjab; other air-conditioned class trains are Khyber Mail for travellers from the north-western city of Peshawar while the Bolan Mail is recommended for travellers from western city of Quetta although this train calls at nearby Kotri railway station.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nOne can go to different parts of the city by self driven cars, taxis as well rickshaws. Within Hyderabad, rickshaws provide cheap and quick transportation for going from one place to another or for city tour and are perfectly fine. Opposed to nearby metropolitan city of Karachi, unfortunately black and white taxis do not operate in Hyderabad. Taxis are generally private cars and operated by taxi companies so they cannot be hailed on streets since distinguishing between a taxi and a private car may be difficult. You can ask at a hotels to arrange a taxi as well one can be get calling at their offices. These taxis are usually air-conditioned, modern and clean fleet which makes them the most comfortable, luxurious way to navigate around the city of Hyderabad especially in the blistering hot weather of Summer.
