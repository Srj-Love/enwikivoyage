Loka Brunn offers spa treatments, restaurants, conference and banqueting rooms. There is a church on the grounds, used in the summer, and the Swedish Spa Museum is located here. The museum was established in 1995 and resides in four buildings from the 18th century, authentically restored. For centuries people travelled Loka to drink its water which was believed to have healing properties. During the 19th century business was booming and people came from all over the country to drink the water and get mud baths. Resorts of this kind were common at the time and guests were mostly members of the upper middle class."]]}]}]},{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Nostalgidagarna"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.nostalgidagar.se\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Is a festival in late June, commemorating Hällefors' heydays in the 1950s and '60s (when its population was twice of today), with American cars and rockabilly music."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Finnstigen"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.friluftsmuseetfinnstigen.se\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Is an open-air museum of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Finland"],["Finnish"]]}," immigrants who have arrived since the 16th century.
