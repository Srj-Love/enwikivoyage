Some of these hills have conspicuous churches perched on top, each of which warrants a different view of the city.\n\nIaşi looks green from above in spite of the ubiquitous brick and concrete due to its boulevards and gardens. Ancient churches, old European style houses and communist apartment buildings compete for space in this crowded city, which is constantly expanding into the surrounding villages; the urban rush of communism replaced houses, pigs, chickens, and cherry trees with apartment buildings. The land was confiscated from the peasants and they received apartments as compensation in the newly created common living spots. Factories sprung around the intensive urban effort, organized together in the industrial zone, only to be abandoned two generations later with the fall of the regime which gave them and the nation purpose. Like all communities in the former Soviet block, Iaşi had to reinvent itself in 1989. The children of those who left the countryside to move to the city now strive to build houses on the outskirting villages, although they drive hondas and not horses. They are not peasants. They wear jeans and French perfume, but they plant grapes and onions and have begun to enjoy the freedoms of having a house like their grandparents had but their parents moved away from. In Iaşi you will find both simplicity and sophistication, and interminable ironies as the reinvention process progress on its own. There are still peasants selling fresh produce in the markets, but their kids may have cell phones which cost 100$. In Iaşi, the landscape changes fast, motivated by psychological and economical turmoil.\n\nTourism in the city takes place around its heritage of archaeological sites, memorial houses, museums and historical and architectural monuments.

The designation of the capital to Bucharest was met with a lot of grief by the local city dwellers. The Moldavian aristocracy moved massively to Bucharest, leaving the former capital devoid of some of its former shine and richness. Nevertheless, Iasi continued to be an important cultural center, providing the launching ramp of Romanian literature's most important 19 century figures. Part of the Kingdom of Romania, Iasi got to be again a capital between 1916-1918, as Bucharest was occupied by the German army. It's palaces and noblemen residences got to house in crisis conditions the state institutions necessary to command the country in times of war.\n\nDuring World War II, Iasi suffered considerable destruction as it saw German and Russian forces fighting on its streets. The communist regime is responsible for the present street pattern and the bulk of its building fund. Newly formed neighbourhoods were providing housing for the working class brought from villages to work in factories. The 1977 earthquake brought another blow to the historical centre of Iasi, as the authorities at that time took advantage of the occasion to raze some of its former town housing (much of it made by the former multi-ethnic bourgeoisie). Nonetheless the key monuments were preserved as long as some patches of housing neighbourhoods mixed between socialist buildings.\n\nAfter 1990, and the collapse of the obsolete heavy industry, Iasi is reinventing itself taking advantage of its universities which constitute the second higher education center in the country, it's smaller-sized industries, software companies, services, and commerce.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nThe local climate is continental with minimal rainfall and with large temperature differences between the seasons.

You should pay attention if they use it or not—it's not unheard of for them to try and get away with charging upwards of €10. The metered rate is 2 RON per kilometre outside city limits and 1.8 RON per kilometre inside them.\n\nIf arriving from another country, bear in mind that there are no currency exchange outlets at Iaşi airport.

You can buy these from ticket offices in stops, but bear in mind that in minor stops these offices close around 5-6 p.m. Ticket machines have been recently installed throughout the city, also having an English interface.\n\nThere is a special tram that goes up and down Copou hill. It is reconditioned classical tram and it's a different style from the normal trams, resembling the San Francisco ones somewhat. \nIn Iasi there aren't trolley busses anymore, like in Bucharest or in other cities in Romania.\n\nThe main reason to go in public transportation is to witness regular people going about their business. Everyone goes on the public transportation. This is a good place to see beggars performing. If you're on a bus, it's fairly likely that some group of little kids will get on and start singing. They are usually gypsies singing traditional Romanian songs, and some of them are rather gifted. They want you to give them money, of course. Also, look out for displays of faith. Romania is one of the most religious countries in Europe, and when passing a church or monastery you may see several passengers, from old women to teenagers in sneaks, doing the sign of the cross.\n\nOld town of Iaşi is quite small, however.

The communist ideal revolved around self-sufficiency, so everything (except for oil and the like) that needed to be used in Iasi was made in Iasi. The city's outskirts are dominated by an immense industrial zone, in which more than 90 percent of the factories have become abandoned. When the communist regime fell, these factories closed one by one, succumbing to foreign competition and internal political chaos. What is left are hundreds of factories, buildings, warehouses and fields which are completely abandoned, overrun with shrubbery, begging for exploration.  It is unique, amazing and wild, and will not last long. With the European Union's accelerating economic involvement in Romania and the increasing price of land in the city, the industrial wasteland will soon be cleaned up and taken under control by the overzealous and bored Romanian policemen. You can get there by asking which way is the \"zona industriala\". If you are in \"Podu Ros\" walk towards \"Tesatura\", away from downtown. As you walk you will pass the electrical power plant. You can also take tram number 1 from Podu Ros and get off at the very end (make sure it's NOT going towards Copou). At the end of the tram line, walk around, because you have entered the largest communist wasteland around Iasi. There are other abandoned factories, but this is the largest concentration. Another extremely large abandoned factory is C.U.G., and used to produce large industrial equipment. It is at the end of bus lines 9 and 41, next to \"Frumoasa\". If you take the train to come into Iasi, you'll probably go by this factory for a very long time. C.U.G. is not completely abandoned, so you should be careful, but it also probably has the most impressive warehouses and heavy machinery. Try to imagine how 30 years ago these places were the workplaces of most of the inhabitants of Iasi.
