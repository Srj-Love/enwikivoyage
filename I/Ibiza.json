Ibiza offers everything from basic hostel-style unmodernised accommodation to five star mega-bling, such as the Ibiza Grand Hotel in Ibiza Town.  Unless you enjoy surrounding yourself with mainly large groups of rowdy drunks who rarely leave their comforts in \"San An\", then avoid the central 'West End' bar strip of San Antonio, although its peripheries are far classier, offering sunset viewing at the hugely popular 'sunset strip', including Cafe Mambo for the Pacha pre-parties, the legendary Cafe Del Mar next door, plus a selection of other bayfront bars. If you just want to relax and chill, and visit nice unspoilt beaches, then it's better to spend a little more on a nice villa (and, of course, rent a car).\n\nThe resort of Playa D'en Bossa has recently witnessed something of a reinvention, with upmarket beach bar\/restaurants such as 'Nassau' and 'Tides' adding to a market that was once monopolised by the now rather passe 'Blue Marlin' in Cala Jondal. The resort has a wide range of hotels, with its proximity to Ibiza Town and the Airport being an advantage (although Ibiza is a small Island with a decent road network).\n\nIf you prefer a hotel, you have plenty to choose from.  There are more than 300 licensed accommodation possibilities on Ibiza, that cover the entire budget range, from hostels to exclusive and intimate rural hotels, and most are represented with web pages online and in numerous travel guides, but do not go there in August without a reservation.  You could wind up on the street or on the beach (also illegal).\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Hotel Sol Ibiza"],["alt=Santa Eulalia"],["url=http:\/\/www.solmelia.com\/solNew\/hoteles\/jsp\/C_Hotel_Description.jsp?codigoHotel=0727"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Hotel Sol s'Sargamassa"],["alt=Santa Eulalia"],["url=http:\/\/www.solmelia.com\/solNew\/hoteles\/jsp\/C_Hotel_Description.jsp?codigoHotel=0744"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Sa Talaia"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.hotelsatalaia.com\/english\/Home"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=San Miguel Park \/ Esmeralda Mar Apartment Resort"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.sanmiguelpark-ibiza.com\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Playa Den Bossa \/ Hotel Garbi"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.hotelgarbi-ibiza.com\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Cas Gasi"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/en.casgasi.com\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=\/ Camino Viejo de Sant Mateu"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Can Talaias"],["url=http:\/\/www.hotelcantalaias.com\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=Can Talaias a privileged spot.
