It is famous for it's flowery botanical garden, proximity to the tranquil Ikeda lake　(池田湖) and the green conical mount Kaimon　（開聞岳）, and a small island with a disappearing sand walkway called Chiringashima (知林ヶ島).  Yet, it's the natural hot springs beneath the beach called \"sunamushi\" (砂蒸し), roughly translated as a sand bath, that is the town's biggest claim to fame.

From March to October, a sandbar of about 800m allows you to walk across part of Kinko Bay to the island in about 20 minutes. The longest time the walkway appears for is four hours. According to city statistics, the walkway appears for over an hour 190 days a year, and 86 days a year it appears for more than two hours.  The island is 3km around and 90 meters tall at its highest point.\nThis sandbar is occasionally washed away after typhoons and disappears for a while, but it is restored when sands are brought back by the tide. The plant Vincetoxicum austrokiusianum, which is listed as an endangered species in Red data book, has been found on Chiringashima. On the island, there are esplanades and an observation deck. This island is known as a matchmaking spot for couples.
