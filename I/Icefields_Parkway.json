The gas-station, store and tourist centre will all be closed for the winter, so there is nowhere to get food or petrol on the Parkway at that time.  In fact, the road is often closed due to weather during the winter.

The actual parkway itself runs for 230 km (143 miles) and is a three-hour drive. But you will want to spend as much time as you can to have time to take in the views.

During the summer, trained guides offer 3 or 5 hour walks on the Athabasca Glacier, but this is only possible when there is no snowcover on the ice. We were there at the very beginning of the tourist season, and the glacier was a smooth white sheet of snow, giving no hint as to the maze of deadly crevasses under its surface. \n\nOther scenic highlights of the drive include ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Peyto Lake"]]},", the Crowfoot and Bow glaciers and the Athabasca Falls. \n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineitinerary"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["related"],["Rocky Mountains (Canada)"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Icefields Parkway"]]}]
