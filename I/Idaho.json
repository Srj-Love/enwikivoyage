Some Idahoans do live in cabins in the middle of nowhere, but others live in urbane condominiums in downtown Boise. Indeed, Boise is now the largest metropolitan area in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rocky Mountains (United States of America)"],["Rocky Mountains"]]}," region of the US outside of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Colorado"]]},". Most of the other major cities in Idaho have also experienced significant growth over the past 20 years.\n\nIdaho is typical of several other western states, e.g., Oregon, Washington, and California, in that there are really two states in one. The northern part of Idaho is characterized by mountains, lakes, forests and rivers.  While the southern half has some spectacular mountains (the Owyhees and parts of the Tetons), it is mostly high-plains desert similar to the Inland Empire of southern California.  \n\nMost of the world-famous Idaho potatoes are grown in Eastern Idaho. Onions are an important cash crop in southwestern Idaho near the Oregon border, while sugar beets are prevalent in the Twin Falls area. As many crops are irrigated in the otherwise arid Snake River Plain, water is an extremely important and potentially explosive political issue in Idaho.\n\nNorthern Idaho farming is characterized by dry land wheat, barley, and legume crops. Logging is also a big part of the northern Idaho economy, although not as much as in the past. A favorite bumper sticker in north Idaho is \"If You Don't Like Logging, Try Using Plastic Bags For Toilet Paper.\"  Similar to Washington and Oregon, there is a great disparity in the population of each half of the state.  North Idaho is significantly less populated than the southern half.\n\nIdaho is second only to Utah in the number of members of ",{"type":"''","value":["The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints"]},", or ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mormons"]},", as a percentage of the population. Mormon religion and culture are particularly prevalent in Eastern Idaho, where the faith is at least as strong as anywhere in Utah. However, the LDS Church's influence diminishes considerably as one travels north of Boise towards the panhandle.\n\nSouthern Idaho is home to one of the largest populations of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Basque"]}," people in the world outside the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Basque Country"]]}," itself. Public displays of ",{"type":"''","value":["Ikurriña"]}," flags and car stickers are somewhat common, even in rural areas. The state even issues a Basque specialty automobile license plate. Next scheduled for 2015, a major Basque festival known as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Jaialdi"]}," is celebrated in Boise every five years.\n\nA common misconception is that Idaho is somehow a racist or Neo-Nazi state. Around 1980, a Neo-Nazi and white separatist brought a band of followers to Hayden Lake near Coeur d'Alene and began regularly making the local and national news with his racist provocations. Although the local residents vigorously disapproved and regularly held much bigger counter-demonstrations, the Neo-Nazi image has stuck. Idahoans breathed a collective sigh of relief in 2001 when the 20 acre compound owned by the \"church\" was handed over to a woman who had filed a lawsuit against them after being assaulted by their guards, and many of the racists left the state.\n\nSoutheastern Idaho, with its sparse topsoil, was greatly affected by the rising water level of prehistoric Lake Bonneville to the south, a lake which covered most of what is now the states of Utah and Nevada.  At Red Rock Pass south of Pocatello, the rising waters broke through into the region in an ancient, massive flood, channeling the floodwater westward for what is estimated to have lasted for approximately seven weeks, almost completely draining the ancient lake and creating the massive, lengthy, and spectacular Snake River Canyon that we know today.  The massive flood stripped the region's topsoil down to bedrock, tumbling huge, multi-story high boulders downstream, where eventually the boulders and other heavier materials dropped out and were deposited in and along the Snake River streambed. The stripped topsoil, a much lighter material, eventually was deposited well to the west, creating  fertile farming regions well adapted to growing potatoes. Because of the great flood and the stripping of the region's topsoil, much of the agriculture in southeastern Idaho's thin layer of topsoil must be supported by fertilization as well as irrigation.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nEnglish is almost universally spoken and understood, except that potatoes are sometimes called \"spuds\" and there's a bit of a rural twang as you get out to the logging and farming areas.

Occasionally Canadian coins become intermingled with US change and may be accepted at face value, or even given as change back to you. This can and does occur even in southern Idaho. Even so, don't be put off if they're refused. Paper currency, however, is all US dollars; if you're south of Sandpoint, don't even try anything else.\n\nSales tax in Idaho is currently 6 percent, which is assessed on most goods including food. The tax is collected at the time of sale, regardless of whether you're from Idaho or not. Some municipalities (mainly in tourist areas), as well as Nez Perce County in north central Idaho also assess a local sales tax in addition to the state tax. There are also taxes included in lodging costs at hotels, motels and campgrounds. Some services are not subject to sales tax.\n\nNative American tribes in Idaho are currently exempt from charging sales taxes on tobacco products. The Nez Perce Tribe charges an alternative tobacco tax to fund scholarships on the tribe's reservation near Lewiston, while the Shoshone Bannock Tribes on the Fort Hall Reservation near Pocatello don't charge tobacco sales taxes at all.\n\nTipping your server or bartender is considered good etiquette at sit-down restaurants and bars, but is generally not expected elsewhere. Even so many Idahoans consider tipping optional - especially in rural areas - so good tips tend to be appreciated by waitstaff much more so than in other places.\n\nIdaho souvenirs almost always follow one of two themes: outdoor topics such as hunting, camping, fishing and skiing, or potatoes.

Last call means last call in Idaho; bar owners risk hefty fines or worse if they're caught serving even one minute past closing time. In 2012 smoking was outlawed in Boise bars and restaurants, however it remains legal in nearby Garden City.\n\nFull-strength beer and wine are readily available in supermarkets and convenience stores. Although selections have improved, if you're not a fan of mass-produced American-style lagers they can often leave something to be desired. Hard liquor must be purchased at a state store. Freestanding state liquor stores are common in the larger cities, although private markets double as the local state store in small towns. Liquor stores are usually closed by 9 PM (or earlier). Other stores stop selling beer and wine at the same time the bars close in that particular county. \n\nThere is a modest liquor production industry in Idaho. The Boise-based Bardenay restaurants distill their own rum. Local potato vodkas – including Glacier, 44° North, Koenig, and Blue Ice – are worth trying.\n\nThe college towns have a good selection of bars, including the occasional microbrewery. Downtown Boise has a vibrant night life as well. Otherwise you'll have to look hard to find any sort of interesting music scene in any but the largest cities. In the more rural areas, you'll be stuck drinking at a country western bar or ... well, that's about it. You might come across a place that plays classic rock, but even those are hard to find, unless you know where to look. Ask a local, because podunk and nice are usually synonyms out there.\n\nOn the plus side, almost every bar but the very swankiest has drink specials at least 3 nights a week. $1.50 wells, $2 pints, doubles for single prices ...\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nIdaho cities are by and large quite safe. While seedy neighborhoods and organized street gang activity exist, people rarely get into trouble without actively looking for it first. Local police tend to be courteous, professional and at times even lenient provided they don't suspect you of any major wrongdoing. They do, however, take an especially dim view of drunk driving and illegal drug possession.\n\nMajor highways are routinely patrolled by the Idaho State Police (ISP), noted for the distinctive diagonal stripes on their vehicles. ISP officers are quick to lend a hand if they see someone in trouble along the side of the road.\n\nThe most pressing safety concerns in Idaho often involve the outdoors. Idaho weather can be fickle and extreme compared to other parts of the world. Mountains make their own weather, and it can be sunny one moment and stormy the next. \n\nIt's extremely easy to get lost in the heavily wooded back country. What's more cell phone service is by and large nonexistent in forested areas. Disastrous encounters with large wildlife (including bears and moose) aren't unheard of. Don't venture away from established campsites or trails unless you're with an experienced guide.\n\nIn other words if you are taking part in some outdoor activity, be prepared. Most importantly, use your common sense.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\nIdaho lies within two time zones, curiously split between north and south instead of east to west. Southern Idaho, including Boise, Idaho Falls, Pocatello and Twin Falls, is in the Mountain Time Zone (UTC -7, DST UTC -6). Northern Idaho, including Coeur d'Alene, Sandpoint, Lewiston and Moscow, is in the Pacific Time Zone (UTC -8, DST UTC -7). The small town of Riggins on U.S. Route 95 approximately 150 miles (241 km) north of Boise is often considered the ",{"type":"''","value":["de facto"]}," dividing line between the two zones (and consequently between northern and southern Idaho in general), although the actual time zone boundary is along the nearby Salmon River.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Respect"]},"\nGenerally speaking societal norms in Idaho are similar to other areas in the United States. However, Idahoans do tend to be slightly more familiar than others in the country. Especially in rural areas, complete strangers will wave to you as you drive by. Don't be afraid to wave back.\n\nIdahoans are extremely sensitive to any allegation that the state is somehow a neo-Nazi enclave, and will be very quick to inform you otherwise if the subject comes up. This is particularly true in the Coeur d'Alene area, which experienced a very small but highly publicized group of neo-Nazis firsthand. \n\nWhile Idahoans are genuinely proud of their potato-growing heritage, a litany of \"spud\" jokes and references tends to wear thin quickly.\n\nConflict between Mormons and non-Mormons is nothing new in Idaho and remains sensitive here, perhaps even more so than in Utah. While anything resembling open hostility on either side is exceptionally rare, the subject can make some people visibly uncomfortable.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\nIdaho is one of the few remaining US states with only one telephone area code statewide: 208. Although there has been talk of an area code split or overlay due to the state's continued growth, nothing is currently planned along those lines. Most localities support emergency 911 services.\n\nCell phone service is reliable in all of the major cities as well as most other parts of the state. The only places you're likely to encounter trouble are deep in the mountains. That said, large no service zones do exist; the further you travel into the back country, the less likely you'll be able to call someone if you get in trouble. In rural areas some carriers may have a noticeably better presence than others. \n\nAll Idaho ZIP postal codes begin with \"83-\". Only the larger cities use more than one ZIP code.\n\nPublic WiFi access is available at most larger hotels, as well as throughout the city of Ketchum in Blaine County.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Go next "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Washington (state)"],["Washington"]]}]}," - Across Idaho's northwestern border the state of Washington offers a less-traveled landscape that varies from mountainous to desert-like conditions."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Oregon"]]}]}," - The state's southwestern neighbor is known for lush forests and craggy mountains, but the portion of the state that immediately borders Idaho is sparsely-populated and features a near-desert landscape."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Nevada"]]}]}," - The Silver State borders Idaho to the southwest and is home to the adult playground of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Las Vegas"]]},"."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Utah"]]}]}," - The rugged mountains and excellent skiing of Utah are a short drive across Idaho's southern border."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Wyoming"]]}]}," - Located to Idaho's southeast, Wyoming is home to most of the landmass of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yellowstone National Park"]]}," and provides an excellent opportunity to experience America's cowboy heritage."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Montana"]]}]}," - Some of America's most rugged and remote country is shared along Idaho's eastern border with Montana."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["British Columbia"]]}]}," - Crossing the state's tiny northern border into Canada leads into the mountainous terrain of southeastern British Columbia."]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usableregion"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["45.0"],["-114.0"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Rocky Mountains (United States of America)"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Idaho"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North America\/United States\/Idaho\/"]]}]
