For this reason, many residents of Idaho Falls drive to ",{"type":"'''","value":["Salt Lake City International Airport"]}," (SLC).  ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Salt Lake City"]]}," is 213 miles to the south. Typically, this drive takes about 3 hours, but due to weather and Salt Lake City traffic it can easily take an additional hour. During the winter months the drive time can significantly lengthen due to poor visibility and road conditions. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nIdaho Falls can be easily reached by I-15 (North \/ South) or by Highway 20 (East \/ West). The ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Utah"]]}," border is about 120 miles south, the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Montana"]]}," border is about 75 miles north, the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wyoming"]]}," border is about 72 miles to the east, and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oregon"]]}," border is about 334 miles to the west.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nThere are several rental car companies and most have representatives at Idaho Falls Airport.\n\nIdaho Falls is small and the majority of the hotels are located centrally enough that a small walk will get you to most destinations. The distance to some locations would warrant a taxi service.  There is fair competition in the taxi business and service is very good for a town this size. You can generally get a ride anywhere in town and even Ammon, which borders Idaho Falls, for under $15 (Idaho Falls city limits, $10). It is more economical to rent a car if you have several destinations over the duration of a day. If you have less than 5-6 stops, taxis are excellent. SafeRide and Easy Way Taxi offer 24\/7 service.\n\nThere is currently no mass transit.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Museum of Idaho"],["url=http:\/\/www.museumofidaho.org\/"],["email="],["address=200 N Eastern Ave"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=take the Broadway exit (118) east across the river - it is just at Broadway and Yellowstone Highway"],["phone=+1 208 522-1400"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=M-Tu, 9am-8pm, W-Sa, 9am-5pm, closed Su"],["price=$6 max, many discounts available"],["content=Dedicated to the history of Idaho and receives many famous traveling exhibits."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Tautphaus Park Zoo"],["url=http:\/\/www.idahofallszoo.org"],["email=ifzoo@idahofallszoo.org"],["address=2725 Carnival Way"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 208 612-8552"],["tollfree="],["fax=+1 208 528-6256"],["hours=9AM-4PM, closed Nov-Mar"],["price=$5 for 13-61, $3.50 for 62+, $2.50 for 4-12, under 4 free"],["content=Home to a large population of animals from six continents."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Idaho Falls River Walk"],["alt=The Greenbelt"],["url=http:\/\/www.ci.idaho-falls.id.us\/main\/index2.asp?PageId=1175"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=Free"],["content=A six mile path situated next to the Snake River, one of the most beautiful sites in Idaho Falls."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Teton Spectrum Racing"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nDespite Idaho Falls' small town environment, there are numerous locations that serve outstanding cuisine, and since most of them are locally owned there is a great customer appreciation found at each of them. Restaurants close to the river include:\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["The Sandpiper"]},".  Serves anything from Rainbow Trout to Lobster (flown fresh into Idaho Falls) to steak.  Considered by many of the locals to be the best restaurant in town.  For the locals The Sandpiper can seem a little pricey, but for those visiting from out of town their menu will not seem outrageously priced.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Jakers"]},". The specialty is steak, but you should also try their seafood dishes.  \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Smitty's"]},". Probably the most popular restaurant in town for breakfast.  Nothing fancy is served, but you can count on the traditional breakfast dishes being prepared to perfection.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["The Collage"]},".  The most expensive restaurant in Idaho Falls, but the quality is excellent and cannot be beaten by any other restaurant in town.  The menu is very international, and the chef changes the menu approximately every three to six months. The Collage is nestled in downtown Idaho Falls, and provides a very quiet, elegant dinner for any who chose to dine there.\n\nSome more common restaurants that are close to the river area are Outback Steakhouse, Chilis, Applebees, Olive Garden, and Ruby's Steakhouse.  Even more restaurants are located across town near the Grand Teton Mall.
