Traces from the Gallo-Roman period still exist, such as the menhir of Pierre Longue (neolithic) near the villages of La Barre and Vau-Savelin..\n\nNormans devastated the district during the 10th century. A church was rebuilt in 1122 by a certain Jacob, at the place where it is now. In 1189, the church of Iffendic was given to Noirmoutier en Touraine Abbey which founded then a priory in the region. After the settlement of the Benedictines, the diocese of Saint-Malo kept sizable rights in the parish of Iffendic.\n\nThe parish was divided into 11 sections, in order to collect taxes: the town centre, Allansac, la Barre, Boutavent, Canlou, Couacurel, Pintillac, Tréez, Tréhieuc, Trévit, and Vaubeuzet. \n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Iffendic had many buildings in the area, like castles and manors. The castle of Boutavent (12th century) accommodated the Lords of Montfort when the castle of Montfort was destroyed. They stayed in Boutavent for nearly two centuries before settling back to their former castle, the one in Montfort. After that, the site seemed to be abandoned, there is no proof that it was uninhabited at that time.\n\nThe population of the town was in favour of the changes brought by the French Revolution, above all after the end of the Reign of Terror. The major revolutionary event is the one celebrating the execution of Louis XVI, accompanied by a hatred oath to royalty and anarchy. It has been celebrated since 1795.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get In"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nThe closest airport is in Rennes.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nRailway station of Montfort-sur-Meu, direct lines from Rennes.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nIllenoo Bus, line 2 : Breteil, Iffendic, La Nouaye, Montfort-sur-Meu, departing from the railway station of Rennes.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nTake RN24 (Rennes \/ Vannes-Lorient) and exit at Talensac-Montfort.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Saint Eloi church "]}," The Gothic style church Saint-Eloi has a stained glass window (1542).
