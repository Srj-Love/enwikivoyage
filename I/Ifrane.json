The current Moroccan king and his projects - like the university and huge new hotel - have had a large impact on the town.  However, it can not be considered a large town. The majority of the population are farmers, sheepherders, etc, and therefore live outside of the town borders.\n\nThe main language in Ifrane is Berber, but you can also hear a great deal of Arabic and French. It is home to Al-Akhawayn University, an American-style university taught in English, French, and Arabic. Nearly all university students will be able to converse fluently in English, but most of the native residents can not.\n\nThe climate is mostly cold with a beautiful clement summer, with a great deal of rain in the first few months of the year. The people are overall very friendly.\n\nOverall, there is very little reason to specifically visit Ifrane if you're limited on time in Morocco. Unless you're a student here or a member of the king's entourage when he visits, there's not a huge amount to visit here- a carved lion, some parks, funky roofs, lots of storks, outdoorsy things, and a Sunday souq pretty much summarize the town.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nMost of the busses comes from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fez"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Meknes"]]},", which are the two major neighboring cities, or pass through on their route from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Marrakesh"]]}," to Fez.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By grand taxi "]},"\nThe easiest way to get into Ifrane is by grand taxi from Fez or Meknes.
