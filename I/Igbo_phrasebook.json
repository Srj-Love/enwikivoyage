Igbo is made up of many different dialects which aren't mutually intelligible to other Igbo speakers at times. A standard for Igbo called 'Igbo izugbe' has been developed. Igbo is written in the Latin alphabet introduced by British colonialists and missionaries. Secret societies such as the Ekpe use nsibidi ideograms to write Igbo and other languages around its area of influence. Nsibidi is an ideographic writing system used for over 500 years.\n\nMajor cities where Igbo is most spoken include Onitsha, Enugu, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Owerri"]]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["oh-weh-reh"]},"), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Port Harcourt"]]},", and Asaba (in Igbo, ",{"type":"''","value":["ah-hah-bah"]},").\n\nThrough the transatlantic slave trade, the Igbo language has influenced many creole languages in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Americas"]]},", especially in the former British ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Caribbean"]]},", including islands such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jamaica"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Barbados"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dominica"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Trinidad and Tobago"]]},".

Accents are used to indicate the high and low tones; an acute accent such as 'ó' are used for high tones, and a grave accent such as 'è' is used for a low tone. There are further accents that indicate nasal tones. The lower dotted accent such as 'ọ' combined with a grave accent ('ọ̀') is used to indicate a low nasal tone, and an upper dotted accent such as 'ė' or a lower dotted accent with an acute accent ('ọ́') is used for a high nasal tone. The trema (¨) such as 'ö' or a simple dot underneath is used for a mid nasal tone. Other diacritics include the caron (ˇ) for rising tones, the circumflex (ˆ) for falling tones, and the macron (¯) for long vowels.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Vowels"]},"\nVowels in Igbo are very similar to those in English when there is little tone stress on them.

Nsibidi symbols were used to represent ideas and often times specific objects. British colonialism since the late 19th century till 1960 has wiped away nisbidi from general use and has led to the introduction of the Roman-script-based orthography known as ọ́nwụ́ which developed from several revisions of Roman orthographies in the 19th century and early 20th century. The first book written in Igbo was an Ibo-Isuama primer by Bishop Ajayi Crowther, a Sierra Leonean creole of Egba-Yoruba descent in the 19th century. As a tonal language, the Latin script has been modified to fit the different tones and sounds of the Igbo language.\n\nIgbo-language literary works have been few since colonialism introduced an alphabet. Literature in English by Igbo writers on Igbo society, however, have achieved international acclaim, the most popular of these books, Things Fall Apart, written by author Chinua Achebe, deals with the subject of colonialism and the destruction of Igbo society in the late 19th century.\n\nThe Igbo languages' tonality may be confusing at times homonyms are differentiated by the way that the tones are expressed. Diacritics are used to signal tones in written Igbo along with other special characters such as the dot over (˙) and underneath (.). \/akwa\/ is a notorious homonym in Igbo which can be interpreted in different tones as \/ákwà\/ ('cloth'), ",{"type":"''","value":["àkwá"]}," ('egg'), \/ákwá\/ ('cry, crying'), \/àkwà\/ ('bed'), \/àkwà\/ ('bridge').\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Written Igbo"]},"\nThere are hundreds of Igbo dialects and Igboid languages spoken by different clans and former nation-states.
