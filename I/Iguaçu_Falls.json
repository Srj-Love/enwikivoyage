US passport holders require a visa (USD130) to visit the Brazilian side of the falls which is NOT issued at the border. European Union passport holders do not need a visa to enter Brazil for tourism, however do remember to get off the bus on the border to get your passport stamped. Some bus drivers will not tell you when to do this, so it is best to check with them. The Brazilian side of the falls is \"a must\".\n\nBeware that there may be lines on either side of the border, depending on the time of the day and holidays.\n\nAlso check regarding immunization requirements. Australian residents, for example, require yellow fever shots if returning to Australia within 6 days following a visit to Brazil.  Brazil also requires yellow fever immunization prior to entering if your passport shows that you have visited some specific South American countries (Guyana, for example).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nBoth the Brazilian and Argentinian cities have nearby airports. From Puerto Iguazu airport there are several flights per day to Buenos Aires and other cities in Argentina.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Brazil"]},"\nFoz do Iguaçu International Airport (Brazil) is served by TAM Airlines, Gol Transportes Aéreos, Trip Airlines, Sol Linhas Aéreas and LAN with direct scheduled flights to and from Lima, Peru, São Paulo Guarulhos\/Congonhas, Rio de Janeiro, Curitiba, Recife, Salvador, Cascavel, Porto Alegre, Londrina, and some more. Pluna airlines from Uruguay has direct flights from Montevideo. The airport is located just off the main road between the city of Foz do Iguaçu and the entrance to the Iguaçu National Park. Taxis are readily available - go to the taxi desk at the entrance to the terminal building and tell them your destination (they speak English) and they will arrange for a car and give you a price. You can either pay by card at the desk or pay the driver in cash. Expect the fare to Foz do Iguaçu to be around BRL25-30. The fare to the park entrance in Brazil is closer and will be less. The airport is on the bus route between Foz do Iguaçu and the National Park entrance. The bus service runs every half hour and is cheap (BRL2.20), efficient and easy to use. The stop is right outside the terminal building - board the front of the bus and pay the person sat at the turnstile (change is given) before passing through. The bus passes many of the main hotels on the way into the city (stops are frequent) and ends up at the bus terminal on the far side of the city where there's a friendly tourist information office. In the other direction the bus will drop you off just outside the main visitor's centre at the entrance to the park.\n\nIf you arrive to Foz do Iguaçu airport and are staying at the Sheraton Iguazu (on the Argentinian side), or just staying in Puerto Iguazu city on the Argentinian side, it is recommended to rent a car at the airport instead (make reservations in advance), so that you can travel from the hotel to the nearby town (which you will want to do if you want to eat there and do some sightseeing) and also to give you the flexibility to go to the Brazilian side of the falls and visit Itaipu dam. Otherwise, a one-way taxi from Foz do Iguaçu airport to the Sheraton is BRL100 (does not include ARS60\/person entry fee for the park), and about ARS150 to go back to the airport from the hotel. A taxi from Foz do Iguazu International Airport (Brazil) to Puerto Iguazu (Argentina), will set you back USD40. You will have to arrange to go to the Brazilian side of the park for about ARS150 or so by taxi (be sure to negotiate down). To go to and from Puerto Iguazu, there is a bus that costs ARS5 and runs every half hour but the last one leaves at 8pm so if you are dining later than that, you will need to hire a taxi for about ARS70. You can also rent a car from the hotel (they will bring the car to you) but book in advance (and check the rates) as there can be a shortage of cars and is usually more expensive (ARS300-450 per day).\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Argentina"]},"\nIf you arrive at Iguazu International Airport, there is a taxi stand at the baggage claim where you can book transfer to either Pte. Iguaze (if you're staying in town) or the Sheraton if you're staying there. Consider renting a car (Hertz, Budget, ...) instead to give you more flexibility, esp. if you plan to spend a day in Brazil as well. It's about 15 minutes from the airport to the park\/ Sheraton and about 30-45 minutes to Pte Iguazu.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nBuses from all major cities in the country arrive in each of the three towns (see there for details).\n\nFrom ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Puerto Iguazu"]]}," there are buses to the entrance of their side of the falls every half hour (currently at :10 and :40 past the hour for ARS15 return).

The BRL2.20 flat fare makes the bus a very cheap way to visit the falls and it's also easy to use. If you're starting your journey at the bus terminal you pay your fare on entering the terminal and board the bus through the rear door (the bus is No. 120 to 'Parque Nacional' - the tourist information office at the terminal will point you in the right direction if you have any trouble finding it). When boarding the bus anywhere else you use the front door and pay at the turnstile onboard. The journey takes about 40 minutes.

It costs BRL4 or ARS8. The bus may or may not stop at the Brazilian border checkpoint but typically will stop at the Argentine border checkpoint, where your passport will be stamped. You can also exchange foreign currency at the Argentine border checkpoint, but be aware that the bus may leave without you if you take too long, leaving you to take a taxi (approx. ARS80) or wait for the next bus. This bus terminates at the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Puerto Iguazu"]]}," bus station where you can catch the bus to the National Park.\n\nFrom ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Puerto Iguazu"]]}," to the Brazilian Iguaçu Falls National Park: take a public bus from the terminal (AARS10). The bus waits while everyone gets off at the Argentine Immigration for your exit stamp. It then drives onto the Brasilian immigration where it *won't* wait for you. No worries, get your Brasil entry stamp and then walk 150m to the main road. Heading right at the roundabout there is a bus stop to the falls, 10 minutes BRL2.20\/ARS7. (The town is to the left, 15min by bus). Conveniently there are large lockers that fit backpacks at the falls entrance (buy token in the shop - BRL9). Which means you can see the falls and then take the bus back to town (or the airport) and get out. Too easy.\n\nIt is not uncommon for policemen to check passports in the Argentinian side of the falls, even during domestic journeys. It is advised to carry some documentation of citizenship. If you are coming from the Brazilian side, tell the bus driver you need to stop at the Brazilian border crossing to get your passport stamped. If you try to re-enter Brazil without having been stamped you may need to pay a substantial fine.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nThe main car rental companies have offices at the Brazilian Foz do Iguaçu airport. Make sure that you mention at the time of your reservation that you intend to cross into the Argentine side to visit the park. You need a special authorization from the rental car company for that. Insurance bought on the Brazilian rental car is not valid in Argentina. You need to buy a special \"carta verde\" while still on the Brazilian side. It is sold at lottery stands. A three-day pass costs BRL45.
