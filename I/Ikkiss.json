It's just over 2000m above sea level and has a population of about 600 people.

The roads however are very prone to damage due to flooding washing them away. Walking to Ikkiss from Imlil is a reasonable alternative. It's about 5 or 6 miles from Imlil over a mountain pass (about 4 hours walking none-stop)\n\nThe road\/track only goes to Imlil over the pass, and not down the main valley (towards Asni). However, footpaths go between all the villages in the valley.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nThere is a rough track that goes part way into the village, but it's mainly just a collection of paths. On foot is the only way.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nThe green, cultivated, terraced fields all over the valley are amazing, as are the mountains.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nHiking is the main activity.
