The island was discovered in 1502 by the Portuguese, and although settlement began shortly thereafter, the village of the island was officially founded only in 1806, with the name of ",{"type":"''","value":["Vila Bela da Princesa"]}," (\"Beautiful Village of the Princess\"). The municipality would finally be named \"Ilhabela\" in 1945.

The duration of the crossing is 15 min. Pedestrians can get into the boat for free. For cars, the fee is R$ 11 (R$ 16,40 on weekends), and half the price for motorbikes. On high season, a queue of up to 1 hour for vehicles is expected.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nSince construction in Ilhabela is mostly restricted to the West coast of the São Sebastião island, there is really just one avenue and getting around, by bus or by car, should be simple. The coast has many slopes, making cycling not a very attractive option.\n\nThere are also a couple of non-pavimented roads that give access to remote points of the island, like the Castelhanos beach in the East coast. A 4x4 vehicle or mountain bike, as well as a prepared driver or cyclist, are necessary for some of them.\n\nThe rest of Ilhabela can only be reached by boat or by trails in the rainforest.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Northwest beaches"]},"\nThe beaches of the Northwest coast are easily accessible using the main avenue and the non-pavimented road in the north.
