Ilkley civil parish includes the adjacent village of Ben Rhydding and is a ward within the metropolitan borough of Bradford. Approximately 12 miles (19 km) north of Bradford, the town lies mainly on the south bank of the River Wharfe in Wharfedale, one of the Yorkshire Dales.\n\nThe town is popular with tourists and is famous for Ilkley Moor. In the 19th century it gained it's reputation as a spa town with the construction of Ben Rhydding Hydro, a Hydropathic Establishment. Charles Darwin underwent hydropathic treatment at Wells House when his book On the Origin of Species was published on 24 November 1859, whilst staying with his family at the nearby North View House (now Hillside Court). Tourists flocked here to 'take the waters' and bathe in the cold water spring.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Leeds Bradford International Airport"]}," - airport serving West Yorkshire and surrounding areas, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.leedsbradfordairport.co.uk\/"]}," approx 11 miles from Ilkley, flights to various European and international destinations and domestic flights within the UK."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Ilkley Railway Station"]}," - train station in the town, trains to and from Leeds\/Bradford.
