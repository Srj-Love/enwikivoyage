The fjord is 500 meters deep, so the iceberg floats to Ilulissat where they hit a barrier, as the fjord is only 250 meters deep at the mouth to the Disko Bay.

The Fjord can only be reached by foot or boat (or by helicopter). It's a fairly easy walk from the city and after 1-2 kilometers' you'll see the icebergs - an impressive sight.
