However the scenery is only one of the elements responsible for the magic of the Inca Trail. Can there be any walk anywhere in the world with such a combination of natural beauty, history and sheer mystery and with such an awe-inspiring destination? The various ruins along the way serve to heighten the hiker's sense of anticipation as he or she approaches what would surely find a place in any new list of archaeological wonders of the world - Machu Picchu.\n\nWalking the Inca trail can be very rewarding and is possible for all ages as long as you are fit. Over the course of the Trail, you gain and lose 1000 meters several times, all of which is over 3000 meters where oxygen is noticeably thinner. Acclimation to the altitude is a must, and good physical condition advised. The journey winds through the valleys and hills of the surrounding area, taking you the through the scenic landscape, from high alpine to cloud forests. \n\nMany agencies operating from Cuzco offer organised hikes along the trail, providing most of the equipment (tents etc)and people to carry it. Also, don't forget that the trail ends at Machu Picchu. If you hiked the Trail, descend from the Sun Gate (Intipunko) at dawn and see Machu Picchu before the busloads of tourists show up around 10AM. \n\nThe trail is scattered with ancient monuments and Incan sites and is definitely worth the effort.\n\nSince 2001, the Peruvian government has instituted a quota system on how many travelers can be on the trail on any given day and the passes now sell out months in advance during the high season. Availability can be checked at the Instituto Nacional de Cultura Cusco website ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.inc-cusco.gob.pe\/"]}," You must book with a tour operator well in advance of when you wish to walk the trail, as it is not allowed to organize your own trip. Don't expect to pick up last-minute cancellations either, as tour organizers must register client passport numbers with the government, and they are strictly checked at control points on the trail.\n\nThe Inca Trail is part of the Machu Picchu Sanctuary, a protected area of 32,592 hectares, managed by the National Institute of Natural Resources, INRENA. Every visitor must obey park regulations prohibiting littering, cutting or damaging trees, removing or damaging stones of ruins and the Trail, removing plants, killing animals, lighting open fires or camping in the archeological sites (Only authorized campsites can be used).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" History "]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" When to go "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cuzco"]]}," has a temperate climate with year round temperatures fluctuating between 14-16Â°C, with warm days and cold nights.

When you are booking an Inca Trail ticket from home, the time of your train is probably a very low priority item. You are probably assuming that someone else made sure you have enough time to spend at Machu Picchu. But the reality is that trains get booked and your trail operator may buy you a train ticket out of Aguas Calientes at 1PM To make it to this train, you will have to be at the train station at 12:30, which means you have to leave Machu Picchu by no later than noon, which means that you will be there only briefly, and have to leave it when it is the most crowded. Machu Picchu is the best in the first half hour after opening and during the last two hours before closing. Most people are gone after 3PM, and the light till 5PM is gorgeous, the heat a little gentler, and you can sit on a patch of grass and soak in the place. You do not want to miss this. It will make Machu Picchu yours. At 10AM Machu Picchu is hot, crowded, loud, and bustling. You will be running around to not lose track of your tour group. At 4PM you can really see it at your own pace, and hang out with the resident chinchillas and llamas. But to do that, you have to take a later train.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Vistadome: there is no point in taking Vistadome after ~ 5PM because it's dark."]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Booking your Inca Trail "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" in 2012, for June, tickets had to be booked ~ 6-7 months in advance"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Preparing for your trip "]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" At its highest, the trail reaches 4200m above sea level, so you should spend at least 2 days in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cuzco"]]}," acclimatising before you start the trek.

You are allowed to pack only 6 kg for the porter to carry so choose carefully.
