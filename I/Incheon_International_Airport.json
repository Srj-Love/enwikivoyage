Two versions exist: Express services to the city (every half hour) takes 43 minutes and cost ₩8,000 (with WiFi available on board), while commuter services (every 6 minutes) take 53 minutes and cost ₩3,700.  \n\nIt is worth noting that with some airlines you can check into your Incheon flight in Seoul Station before you get on the AREX train. Immigration officers are also on hand to stamp your passport, which means you are processed and can quickly go through the Diplomatic Departures entrance in Incheon Airport.\n\nTravel time to Gimpo Airport is 28\/35 minutes, with both services charging ₩3,100, making this the fastest and cheap option for intra-airport transfer as well.  If you are heading to Incheon International from Seoul Station and using Korean, Asiana or Jeju Air, the express train may be your best option. You can check your bags and even pass through security and immigration, allowing you to skip the lines at the airport and to spend a little longer in the city, or helping you make a mad dash to the airport.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["KTX direct from the airport"],["A new high speed KTX station may open in Incheon airport in June 2014, allowing passengers to travel at high speed directly to destinations on the KTX network throughout South Korea.

If you're visiting for the first time, it's worth paying a bit extra for the limousine bus. For either bus type, consult the big maps or staff to figure out which route best suits your needs; you can then find the shuttles outside 1st floor arrivals (if possible get this information from your hotel before arriving).  Or simply, walk out and ask the many ticket sellers (they are wearing vests) which bus goes to your hotel because if it's a popular one or in a popular area, they'll surely know which you'll need. It's best to buy tickets at any of the ticket gates near the bus arrival area but you can also pay the fare using won or a T-Money card if you have one. The limousine bus drivers are extremely friendly but don't count on them knowing too much English. There are maps inside the buses letting passengers know which stops are upcoming and these are also announced in Korean and English. Pressing any of the red buttons inside signals to the driver you want off at the next stop. \n\nYou can purchase and recharge a T-Money card at the GS25 store which is located at the end of the arrivals area, next to \"International Arrivals F\" exit.\n\nIf you have a late flight and plan on getting into Seoul via bus, make sure you get out to the curb as soon as you can. The last buses run shortly after the last flights land. If you miss your bus, you'll be stuck paying for a taxi, as the trains will stop running too.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Taxi"]},"\nA taxi direct to Seoul will cost around ₩50,000\/70,000 regular\/deluxe. Black deluxe taxis (모범 택시) and almost all regular taxis accept credit cards, but a few regular taxis (일반 택시) may not. Ask the driver before you get on if you can pay by credit card. You are expected to pay any road tolls on top of the meter fare. Having your destination written down in Korean will be very helpful. Steer clear of taxi drivers trying to pick you up from inside the terminal and even the bus stop.
