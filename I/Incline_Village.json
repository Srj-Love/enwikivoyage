Along with picnic tables, barbecues and chaise lounges (provided at no charge by the friendly staff) you'll find a kids playground, sand volleyball courts, concession stand and a roped off swimming area.  \n\nSince all the beaches in Incline Village are private and accessible only to residents and lodging guests, you'll need to finagle a guest pass to use the beach.  If you don't have friends or relatives who own property in Incline Village that can give you a beach pass, stop by Lakeshore Realty and ask for Don Kanare.  He usually keeps an extra beach pass handy that you can borrow to enjoy a day on the beach.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Diamond Peak Ski Resort"],["url=http:\/\/www.diamondpeak.com"],["email="],["address=1210 Ski Way"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=from Country Club drive turn on to Ski way follow to end"],["phone = +1 775-832-1177"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=9AM-4PM"],["price="],["content=A family friendly ski resort with great views of Lake Tahoe.
