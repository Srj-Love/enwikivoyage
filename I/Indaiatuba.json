Therefore \"Indaiatuba\" means \"many indaiás\". The denomination attached itself on the environment's features as well as the place's vegetation, which today aren't the same as it used to be. Indaiatuba turned into a municipality in 1830, although it is told the city was born previously.\n\nThe remarkable existence of the \"indaiá\" type of palms, loaded with tiny coconuts, were the reason for Indaiatuba to receive, at the end XVIII Century and the beginning of the XIX Century, the name of \"Cocais\" (Portuguese for \"Coconuts\"). The people who lived at first in the municipality would have firstly received the name of \"Votura\", designation of the river whose mouth was close to the village.\n\nEver since the XIX Century, Indaiatuba received many immigrants from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Switzerland"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Germany"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Italy"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Spain"]]}," and, at the XX Century, Immigrants from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Japan"]]},". These men and women dedicated themselves on agriculture but also on the market, on the factories and manufacturers. Along with it's economy divided between germination of coffee and potato and also some small factories, the city expanded a very little in the first half of the XX Century. In 1950 there were 11.253 inhabitants in the municipality. In 1964 they were 22.928. Since then the expansion got faster, mainly because of the factorie's and service's growth. Based on the 1991's census there were 92.700 inhabitants, a number of which in 2000 surprisingly grew to 146.829, and keeps increasing.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["-23.0903"],["-47.2181"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Campinas Region"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Indaiatuba"]]}]
