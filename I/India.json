This is the period when the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Vedas"]},", the oldest and holiest books of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hinduism"]},", were compiled. The Vedic civilization influences India to this day. Present-day Hinduism traces its roots to the Vedas, but is also heavily influenced by literature that came afterwards, like the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Upanishads"]},", the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Puranas"]},", the great epics — ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ramayana"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mahabharata"]},", and the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bhagavad Gita"]},". By tradition, these books claim to only expand and distill the knowledge that is already present in the Vedas. Some rituals of Hinduism took shape during that period. Most North Indian languages come from Sanskrit, the language of the Vedas, and are classified as part of the Indo-European group of languages. In the 1st millennium BCE, various schools of thought in philosophy developed, enriching Hinduism greatly. Most of them claimed to derive from the Vedas. However, two of these schools – ",{"type":"'''","value":["Buddhism"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Jainism"]}," – questioned the authority of the Vedas and they are now recognized as separate religions.\n\nMany great empires were formed between 500 BCE and 500 CE. Notable among them were the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mauryas"]}," and the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Guptas"]},". This period saw major mathematical and astronomical advancements ahead of their times. This period also saw a gradual decline of Buddhism and Jainism. The practice of Buddhism, in particular, disappeared from India's heartland, though Buddha himself was incorporated into the Hindu pantheon. Jainism continues to be practiced by a significant number who are ambivalent about whether they consider themselves Hindus or not. Hinduism itself went through significant changes. The importance of Vedic deities like Indra and Agni reduced and  Puranic deities like Vishnu, Shiva, their various Avatars and family members gained prominence.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Jama Masjid, Delhi, morning view.jpg"],["thumb"],["Jama Masjid, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Delhi"]]}]]},"\n\nIslamic incursions started in the 8th century. Gradually the raiders started staying as rulers, and soon much of North India was ruled by Muslims.  The most important of the Muslim rulers were the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mughals"]},", who established an empire that at its peak covered almost the entire subcontinent (save the southern and eastern extremities), while the major Hindu force that survived in the North were the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Rajputs"]},".

Eventually, however, the Rajputs were subdued, and the Rajput-Mughal alliance remained strong till the end of the empire. This period of North India was the golden age for Indian art, architecture, and literature, producing the monumental gems of Rajasthan and the Taj Mahal. Hindi and Urdu also took root in medieval North India. During the Islamic period, some Hindus also converted to Islam. Today, some 13% of the Indian population follows Islam. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Sikhism"]},", another major religion, was established in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Punjab"]]}," during the Mughal period. Relations between Sikhism and the Mughals varied over time. The ",{"type":"'''","value":["Golden Temple"]}," at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amritsar"]]}," was built and recognised all over the world as Sikhs major pilgrimage center. By the time of its tenth Guru - ",{"type":"'''","value":["Guru Gobind Singh"]},", however, relations were hostile, primarily due to the antagonism of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Aurangzeb"]},", the most intolerant and bigoted of the Mughals. Conflict between the Sikhs and the Mughals was one of the causes for the eventual decline of the Mughal empire. The other cause was the challenge of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["'Marathas"]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Maharashtra"]]},", which was started by ",{"type":"'''","value":["Shivaji"]}," and carried on by the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Peshwas"]},". The Marathas established a short-lived confederacy that was almost as large as the Mughal empire. Marathas lost their command over India after the third battle of Panipat, which in turn paved a way for British Colonialism.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:ShoreTemple Approach2.JPG"],["thumb"],["Shore Temple (c. 700 CE), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mamallapuram"]]}]]},"\n\nSouth India followed a different trajectory, being less affected by Islamic rule. The period from 500 to 1600 CE is called the classical period dominated by great South Indian kingdoms. Prominent among them were the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Chalukyas"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["Rashtrakutas"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Vijayanagara"]}," empires who ruled from present day Karnataka and the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Pallavas"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cheras"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["Pandyas"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cholas"]}," who ruled from present day Tamil Nadu & Kerala. Among them, the Cholas are widely recognised to be the most powerful of the South Indian kingdoms, with their territory stretching as far north as Pataliputra and their influence spreading as far east as Sumatra, Western Borneo and Southern Vietnam at the height of their power. Some of the grandest Hindu and Jain monuments that exist in India were built during this time in South and East India.\n\nEuropean traders started visiting India beginning in the late 16th century. Prominent among these were the British, French and the Portuguese. The British East India Company made ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Calcutta"]]}," their headquarters in 1772. They also established subsidiary cities like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bombay"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chennai"],["Madras"]]},". Calcutta later went onto to become 'the second city of the empire after ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]},"'. By the 19th century, the British had, one way or the other assumed political control of virtually all of India, though the Portuguese and the French too had their enclaves along the coast.\n\nThere was an uprising by Indian rulers in 1857 which was suppressed, but which prompted the British government to take over from the Company and make India a part of the empire. Many Indians converted to Christianity during the period, for pretty much the same reasons as they converted to Islam, though forcible conversions ended in British India after 1859, and Queen Victoria's proclamation promised to respect the religious faiths of Indians.\n\nNon-violent resistance to British colonialism under ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi"]}," led to independence on 15 August 1947.  However, independence was simultaneously granted to the secular state of India and the smaller Islamic state of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pakistan"]]},", and the orgy of Hindu-Muslim bloodletting that followed ",{"type":"'''","value":["Partition"]}," led to the deaths of at least half a million and the migration of 12-14 million people.\n\nIndia achieved self-sufficiency in food grains by the 1970s, ensuring that the large-scale famines that had been common are now history.  However these policies also led to shortages, slow growth and large-scale corruption. After a balance-of-payments crisis in 1991, the country adopted free-market reforms which have continued at a meandering pace ever since, fueling strong growth. The ",{"type":"'''","value":["IT"]}," and the ",{"type":"'''","value":["business outsourcing"]}," industries have been the drivers for the growth, while ",{"type":"'''","value":["manufacturing"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["agriculture"]},", which have not experienced reforms, are lagging. About 60% of Indians live on agriculture and around 36% remain in poverty.\n\nRelations with Pakistan have been frosty. The two countries have fought four wars, three of them over the status of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kashmir"]]},". The third war between the two countries in 1971 resulted in East Pakistan becoming Bangladesh. India continues to experience occasional terrorist attacks that are widely believed to originate in Pakistan and ordered by its military-intelligence complex.\n\nChina and India went to war in 1962 over a border dispute. Though current relations are peaceful, there is still military rivalry and no land crossings are allowed between the two countries, though one border crossing between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sikkim"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tibet"]]}," was re-opened in 2006 for trade. Security concerns over Pakistan and China prompted India to test ",{"type":"'''","value":["nuclear weapons"]}," twice (including the 1974 tests described as \"peaceful explosions\"). India wants to be accepted as a legitimate nuclear power and is campaigning for a permanent ",{"type":"'''","value":["Security Council"]}," seat.\n\nIndia is proud of its democratic record. Constitutional government and democratic freedoms have been safeguarded for most of its 66 years as an independent country.\n\nCurrent concerns in India include the  corruption, poverty, over-population, environmental degradation, ongoing disputes with Pakistan and China, terrorism, and ethnic and religious strife. But the current obsession, at least among the educated elite, is over whether India will be able overtake China in economic growth.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Politics"]},"\nIndia is a Parliamentary Democracy modeled on the British Westminster system. The President, indirectly elected, is the Head of State, but his position, while not entirely ceremonial, has limited powers. The Prime Minister runs the government with a Cabinet of Ministers. The Parliament is bicameral. The Lok Sabha (House of People), the lower house, is directly elected by universal adult franchise, while the Rajya Sabha (Council of States), or the upper house, is indirectly elected. The Lok Sabha is the more powerful of the two, primarily because a majority in the Lok Sabha is required to form a government and pass budgets. India has a vast number of political parties, and currently the BJP party has a majority in the Lok Sabha. India has a strong and independent judiciary and a free press.\n\nIndia is also a Federal Republic, divided into states and union territories. Each of these have their own legislatures, with government run by a chief minister and a cabinet.\n\nStreet demonstrations and political agitations occur, as they do in any democracy.

The Southwest monsoon hits the west coast the most, as crossing the western ghats and reaching the rest of India is an uphill task for the winds.

While it is a mistake to assume that there is a single unified Indian culture, there certainly are unifying themes that link the various cultures. India's cultural heritage is expressed through its myriad of languages in which much great literature and poetry has been written. It can be seen in its music - both in its classical (Carnatic and Hindustani) forms and in modern Bollywood music. India also has a vast tradition of classical and folk dances. Art and theatre flourish amongst the bustling cities of the country, against the backdrop of the ever expanding western influences.\n\nIndians value their family system a lot. Typically, an Indian's family encompasses what would be called the extended family in the West. It is routine for Indians to live as part of the paternal family unit throughout their lives - i.e. sons live together with their parents all their lives, and daughters live with their parents till they get married. The relationship is mutually self-supporting. Parents may support their children for longer than is common in the West, brothers and sisters may support each other, and sons are expected to take care of their parents in their old age. \"Living with parents\" does not carry the same stigma as it does in the US. Naturally, the arrangements are not perfect and there are strains and breakups, especially by the time the third generation grows up. Also, it has now become common for children to move away from the parental house for education and employment. Nonetheless, it is fair to say that the joint family is still seen as the norm and an ideal to aspire to, and Indians continue to care about their family's honour, achievements and failures even while they are not living together.\n\nDespite the weakening of the caste system (which has officially been outlawed by the Indian government), India remains a fairly stratified society. Indians care more about a person's background and position in society than is the norm in the individualist West. This attitude, when combined with the legacy of colonial rule, results in some rather interesting, if unfortunate consequences. People with white skin are placed high on the societal totem pole, and they may find that Indians are obsequious towards them to the point of embarrassment. People with dark skin, however may find that they are discriminated against. If it is any  consolation, Indians display similar prejudices based on skin colour and ethnicity among themselves and not just towards foreigners.

However, in areas hardly or not at all visited by tourists, it is not at all uncommon for people who go out of their way to 'proactively' help you when you approach without expecting anything in return. During your travels in India, you will be deluged with touts trying to get you to buy something or patronize particular establishments.\n\nThere are a myriad of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["common scams"]]},", which range from telling you your hotel has gone out of business (of course, they'll know of one that's open with vacancies), to giving wrong directions to a government rail ticket booking office (the directions will be to their friend's tour office), to trying to get you to take diamonds back to your home country (the diamonds are worthless crystal), to 'poor students' giving you a sightseeing for hours and then with pity make you buy school books for them (tremendously overpriced from a bookstore with whom they are affiliated). There will also be more obvious touts who \"know a very good place for dinner\" or want to sell you a chess set on the street.\n\nFaced with such an assault, it's very easy to get into a siege mentality where all of India is against you and out to squeeze you dry. Needless to say, such a mentality may affect any true appreciation of the country. Dealing with touts is very simple: assume anyone offering surprising information (such as \"your hotel is shut down\") is a tout. Never be afraid to get a second or third answer to a question.

However booking for this service online or in person is an even more fraught experience.\n\nIt is sometimes difficult to book Tatkal tickets online because of excess amount of traffic on Indian railway website. Indian railway recently launched E-wallet facility which enables user to keep money on Indian railway website for faster booking of tickets. This facility reduces the time of ticket booking because users skips the payment gateway processing time. It is very fast to book tickets using E-wallet facility.

The Railways are concerned about the bad quality of pantry car meals and efforts are underway to improve things, but do not count on it as yet. If you are finicky, bring enough food and bottled water for the journey including delays: bananas, bread, and candy bars are good basics to have. At most larger stations hawkers selling tea, peanuts, and snack food and even complete meals will go up and down the train. Most important stations will have vendors selling all kinds of edible stuff, but the usual caveats about eating in India apply. Note that in the most luxurious 'Rajdhani' & 'Shatabdi' trains, meals are included in your ticket price and served at your seat during travel. There are no dining cars in Indian Railways except in select luxury trains.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\n\nIn central locations of big cities like airports or stations reliable pre-paid taxis are available and will save you money as well as the bargaining hassle. These pre-paid taxi booth are managed by local traffic police officials, prefer to use this facility where ever available to avoid inconvenience. However, beware of touts who would claim themselves to be running pre-paid taxis. Always collect the receipt from the counter first. The receipt has two parts - one part is for your reference and the other part you will need to handover to the taxi driver only after you reach your desired destination. The taxi driver will get his payment by submitting or producing this other part to the pre-paid taxi counter.  Be aware that the taxi driver may not know how to get to your destination, and will not tell you this beforehand.  This may result in the taxi stopping at various points during the journey as the driver gets out to ask for directions.  Insist on being taken to your original destination, and not a substitute offered by the driver (e.g. a different hotel).\n\nNormal taxis running by meter are usually more common.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Pathankot Bus.JPG"],["thumb"],["240px"],["Ordinary-class Himachal Road Transport Co bus, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dharamsala"]]}]]},"\n\nWhile you can't take a cross-country bus-ride across India, buses are the second most popular way of travelling across states and the only cheap way of reaching many places not on the rail network (e.g. Dharamsala).\n\nEvery state has its own public bus service, usually named \"",{"type":"''","value":["X"]}," Road Transport Corporation\" (or ",{"type":"''","value":["X"]},"RTC) or \"",{"type":"''","value":["X"]}," State Transport Corporation\" (or ",{"type":"''","value":["X"]},"STC) which primarily connects intrastate routes, but will also have services to neighbouring states.

The ",{"type":"'''","value":["ordinary"]}," buses (called differently in different states, e.g. \"service bus\") are extremely crowded with even standing room rarely available (unless you're among the first on board) as reservations are not possible and they tend to stop at too many places.

Some state transport corporations have even introduced \"Volvo\" brand buses on some routes which are extremely luxurious and comfortable. These better class \"express\" or \"luxury\" buses have assured seating (book in advance), and have limited stops, making them well worth the slight extra expense. But even these better-class buses rarely have toilets and make occasional snack and toilet breaks.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Private buses"]}," may or may not be available in the area you are travelling to, and even if they are, the quality could vary a lot.

Restrooms are available in large bus stations but are crowded. Unfortunately, the bus industry is ",{"type":"'''","value":["extremely fragmented"]}," and there are few operators who offer services in more than 2 or 3 neighbouring states.

Their services are good and they provide entertainment on board.\n\nRegardless of class of travel, all buses have to contend with the poor state of Indian highways and the havoc of Indian traffic which usually makes them slower, less comfortable and less safe than trains. Night buses are particularly hazardous, and for long-distance travel it's wise to opt for sleeper train services instead.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Driving on your own"]},"\n\nIn India driving is on the ",{"type":"'''","value":["left"]}," of the road — at least most of the time. You can drive in India if you have a local license or an International Driving Permit, but unless you are accustomed to driving on extremely chaotic streets, you probably will not want to.  The average city or village road is narrow, often potholed and badly marked. ",{"type":"'''","value":["National Highways"]}," are better, but they are still narrow, and Indian driving discipline is non-existent. In the past few years the Central government has embarked on an ambitious project to upgrade the highways. The ",{"type":"'''","value":["Golden Quadrilateral"]}," connecting the four largest cities of Chennai, Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata with four-laned highways has been completed and is of a reasonable standard. Some of it is of an international standard but that cannot be said for all of it. However, improving the quality of the roads does not improve the way in which people drive and it is very dangerous to drive on the roads in India as people drive as they like without regard to any rules (rules do exist but are almost never enforced).\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Hiring driver with car"]},"\n\nInstead, if you desire going by a car, opt for driver while renting the car. Rates are quoted in rupees per kilometer and you will have to pay for both ways even if you are going only one way. The driver's salary is  low (typically around ₹100-150 per day) that it adds little to the cost of renting the car. The driver will find his own accommodation and food wherever you are travelling, although it is customary to give him some money to buy some food when you stop somewhere to eat. A common rental vehicle is the legendary Hindustan Motors Ambassador, which is essentially an Indian-made copy of the 1956 Morris Oxford: it's large, boxy, with space for 5 passengers (including driver) and a decent-sized boot. However, the Tata Indica (a hatchback) and Tata Indigo (a small saloon) is now replacing the Ambassador as the cheap car of choice. Imported international models may be available at a premium. If the number of people travelling together is large, popular rental vehicles are Tata Sumo, Mahindra Xylo and Toyota Innova. The larger vehicles are suitable if you are travelling in larger groups or have excess luggage. Many vehicles come equipped with a roof carrier, so one may opt for a smaller vehicle for 2-3 passengers even with excess luggage. (Note: You may need to specifically ask for a vehicle with a roof carrier)\n\nThere are numerous advantages to having a car and driver.\n",{"type":"*","value":["A good local driver is the safest means of car travel."]},{"type":"*","value":["You can keep your bags and shopping goods with you securely wherever you go."]},{"type":"*","value":["The driver will often have some knowledge of local tourist destinations."]},{"type":"*","value":["A car is the quickest and most reliable means of going from point to point.

As a result, misunderstandings are common. Keep sentences short. Use the present tense. Use single words and hand gestures to convey meaning.\n\nMake sure you can trust your driver before you leave your goods with him. If he shows any suspicious motives or behavior make sure you keep your bags with you. Conversely, if your driver is very friendly and helpful, it is a nice gesture to buy him a little something to eat or drink when stopping for food. They will really appreciate this.\n\nYour driver may in some cases act as a tout, offering to take you to businesses from which he gets ",{"type":"''","value":["baksheesh"]}," (a sort of commission). This isn't necessarily a bad thing - he may help you find just what you're looking for, and add a little bit to his paltry income at the same time. On the other hand, you should always evaluate for yourself whether you are being sold on a higher-cost product than you want. Also, many times, these places that supply commissions to the driver (especially restaurants) may not always be the best or most sanitary, so use your judgement. Avoid touts on the road posing as guides that your driver may stop for because he gets a commission from them; supporting them only promotes this unpleasant practice. The driver might ",{"type":"''","value":["ask"]}," for a tip at the end of the trip. Pay him some amount (₹100\/day is generally sufficient) and don't let him guilt-trip you into paying too much.\n\nIf you rent a car for a trip to a remote destination, make sure before getting out that you will recognize the driver and write down the license plate number and his phone number (nearly all drivers have mobile phones).  Touts at tourist areas will may try to mislead you into getting into the wrong car when you leave; if you fall for this you will certainly be ripped off, and possibly much worse such as sexual assault if you are female traveller.\n\nBe wary of reckless driving when renting a car with a driver. Do not be afraid to tell the driver that you have time to see around and that you are not in a hurry. Indian highways can be ",{"type":"''","value":["extremely dangerous"]},". Make sure also that your driver gets enough rest time and time to eat. In general as you visit restaurants, the driver may eat at the same time (either separately at the same restaurant or at some other nearby place). He may be willing to work nonstop for you as you are the \"boss\", but your life depends on his ability to concentrate, so ensure that your driving demands are reasonable; for example, if you decide to carry your own food with you on the road, be sure to offer your driver time to get a lunch himself.\n\nAvoid travel at night.  Indian roads are dimly lit if at all, and there are even more hazards on the road after dark — even highway bandits if you get far enough off the beaten track.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By motorcycle"]},"\n\nSome people point out that ",{"type":"'''","value":["the best way to experience India is on a motorbike"]},". Riding a motorbike and travelling across India you get the closer look and feel of India with all the smells and sounds added. There are Companies which organise packaged tours or tailor made tours for Enthusiastic bikers and adventurous travellers for a safer motorbike experience of India. Blazing Trails tours, Wild Experience tours and Extreme Bike tours are the known names in the market.\n\nAnother choice, popular with people who like taking risks, is to ",{"type":"'''","value":["buy a motorcycle"]},". Not for the faint of heart or inexperienced rider. India boasts the highest motor vehicle accident rate in the world.\n\nThe Royal Enfield is a popular (some would say, the only) choice for its classic looks and macho mystique. This despite its high petrol consumption, 25 km\/litre to 30 km\/litre, supposed low reliability (it is \"classic\" 1940s engineering after all and requires regular service adjustment; you can find an Enfield mechanic who has worked on this bike for ten, twenty, thirty years in every town in India, who will perform miracles at about ₹100 an hour labour cost), and claimed difficulty to handle (actually the bike handles beautifully, but may be a wee heavy and seat high for some).\n\nOr, one can opt for the smaller yet quicker and more fuel efficient bikes. They can range from 100 cc to the newly launched 220 cc bikes. Three most popular bike manufacturers are Hero, Bajaj and Honda. The smaller variants (100-125 cc) can give you a mileage exceeding 50 km\/litre on the road, while giving less power if one is opting to drive with pillion on the highways. The bigger variants (150-220 cc) are more powerful and one can get a feel of the power especially on highways - the mileage is lesser for these bikes anywhere between 35 km\/litre to 45 km\/litre.\n\nPreferably tourists should go for second hand bikes rather than purchasing new ones. The smaller 100 cc variants can be purchased for anywhere between ₹15,000-25,000 depending on the year of make and condition of vehicle. The bigger ones can be brought from ₹30,000 onwards.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By hitch hiking"]},"\n\nHitch hiking in India is very easy due to the enormous number of cargo trucks on every highway and road. Most drivers do not speak English or any other international language; however, most have a very keen sense of where the cities and villages are located along the road. It is rare for any of them to expect payment.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By auto-rickshaw"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Havelock Autorickshaw.JPG"],["thumb"],["A typical Indian autorickshaw, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Andaman Islands"]]}]]},"\n\nThe auto-rickshaw, sometimes abbreviated as \"auto\" and sometimes as \"rickshaw\", is the most common means of hired transportation in India. Most residents usually refer to them as a ",{"type":"'''","value":["\"three wheeler\""]}," or ",{"type":"'''","value":["\"tuk-tuk\""]},".  They are very handy for short-distance travel in cities, especially since they can weave their way through small alleys to bypass larger cars stuck in travel jams, but are not very suitable for long distances.  Most are green and yellow, due to the new CNG gas laws, and some may be yellow and black in color, with one wheel in the front and two in the back, with a leather or soft plastic top.\n\nWhen getting an auto-rickshaw, you can either negotiate the fare or go by the meter. In almost all cases it is better to use the meter—a negotiated fare means that you are being charged a higher than normal rate. A metered fare starts around ₹13(different for different areas), and includes the first 1 to 2 kilometres of travel. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Never"]}," get in an auto-rickshaw without either the meter being turned on, or the fare negotiated in advance. In nearly all cases the driver will ask an exorbitant sum (for Indian standards) from you later. A normal fare would be ₹11-12 for the first km and ₹7-8 per km after that. In most of the cities, auto-rickshaw drivers are provided with a rate card that elaborately describes the fares on per kilometre basis. A careful tourist must verify the meter-reading against the rate-card before making a payment. Auto-rickshaws carry either digital or analog meters wherein the analog meters may have been tampered with. It may be a better option to go for a negotiated fare when the auto-rickshaw has an analogue meter.\n\nIdeally, you should talk with a local to find out what the fare for any estimated route will be. Higher rates may apply at night, and for special destinations such as airports. Finally, factor in that auto drivers may have to pay bribes to join the queue for customers at premium location such as expensive hotels. The bribe will be factored in the fare.\n\nMake sure that the driver knows where he is going.  Many autorickshaw drivers will claim to know the destination without really having any clue as to where it is. If you know something about the location, quiz them on it to screen out the liars.  If you do not know much about the location, make them tell you in no uncertain terms that they know where it is. This is because after they get lost and drive all over the place, they will often demand extra payment for their own mistake.  You can then tell them that they lied to you, and wasted your time, so they should be happy to get the agreed-upon fee.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Addresses"]},"\n\nIf you need to get anywhere, call in advance and ask for detailed directions. Bear in mind that street signs in India tend to be rare or nonexistent.  Postal addresses are often stated in terms of other landmarks, as in \"Opp. Prithvi theatre\" or \"Behind Maruti Showroom\". Unlike the western system of address, the Indian system uses municipal ward number, plot number, house number, landmark and the location instead of street name and block number. Finding a place will usually involve some searching, but you will always find someone out on the streets to guide you. Unlike many other countries, Indians usually do ask passers-by, nearby shopkeepers or cops for guidance on street addresses. It is usually safe to ask a cop or traffic-policeman for guidance. GPS enabled devices work well in major cities, but may not be always accurate, especially in rural areas.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Innerline permit"]},"\n\nInner Line Permit is an official travel document issued by the Government of India to allow inward travel of an Indian citizen into a protected\/restricted area for a limited period.

English is compulsory in all schools, and is widely spoken among affluent sectors of the population in major cities and around most tourist places, as well as in most police stations and government offices, and acts as the ",{"type":"''","value":["lingua franca"]}," among educated Indians. However, if possible, you are better off picking up as many words as you can of the local language of the place you are going to - people are proud of their state's (or region's) culture and language and will appreciate it if an outsider makes an attempt to communicate in it. Code-switching between English and the local language is common among the youth in urban areas, although most educated people would speak standard English when talking to foreigners.\n\nMany Indian languages lack a word for please, just like the Scandinavian languages. Instead, verbs have many forms denoting levels of politeness and formality. As there is no such distinction in English, Indians may also seem commanding to a westerner. You may here phrases like ",{"type":"''","value":["come here"]}," which may sound commanding to Anglophones from Western cultures, but this is not meant to be rude.\n\nThere are plenty of English language TV shows that air in India (without dubbing) on Zee Cafe, FX, Star World, BBC Entertainment, AXN, Warner Bros and BIG CBS Prime. However, with the exception of BIG CBS Prime, shows are usually a season behind. Nearly all shows are American (except for the ones on BBC Entertainment). There are many other TV channels in English; in fact, there are more English TV channels than in any other Indian language. English language films in cinemas are generally shown in their original language with subtitles in the local language.

There are regional variations too — the coastal regions make greater use of coconut and fish. In the State of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kerala"]]},", it is common to use grated coconut in everything and coconut oil for cooking, while someone from the interior could be surprised to learn that coconut oil can be used for cooking. The South also has some great breakfast dishes like ",{"type":"''","value":["idli"]}," (a steamed cake of lentils and rice), ",{"type":"''","value":["dosa"]},", a thin, crispy pancake often stuffed with spiced potatoes to make ",{"type":"''","value":["masala dosa"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["vada"]},", a savoury Indian donut, and ",{"type":"''","value":["uttapam"]},", a fried pancake made from a rice and lentil batter with onions and other vegetables mixed in.  All of these can be eaten with ",{"type":"''","value":["dahi"]},", plain yogurt, and ",{"type":"'''","value":["chutney"]},", a condiment that can be made from practically anything. Try the ever popular Masala Dosa, which originated from Udupi in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Karnataka"]]},", in one of the old restaurants of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bangalore"]]}," like CTR and Janatha in Malleswaram or Vidyarthi Bhavan in Basavangudi or at MTR near Lalbagh. South Indian cuisine is predominantly vegetarian, though there are exceptions: seafood is very popular in Kerala and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mangalore"]]},"an coast of Karnataka; and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tamil Nadu"],["Chettinad"]]}," and Hyderabad cuisines use meat heavily, and are a lot more spicier. Coffee tends to be the preferred drink to tea in South India.\n\nTo the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["West (India)"],["West"]]}]},", you will find some great cuisine groups. ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Gujarat"]]},"i"]}," cuisine is somewhat similar to Rajastani cooking with the heavy use of dairy products, but differs in that it is predominantly vegetarian, and often sweetened with jaggery or sugar. Gujaratis make some of the best snack items such as the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Dhokla"]}," and the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Muthia"]},". ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mumbai"]]}," is famous for its chaat, as well as the food of the small but visible Irani and Parsi communities concentrated in and around the city. The adjacent states of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Maharashtra"]]}," and Goa are renowned for their seafood, often simply grilled, fried or poached in coconut milk. A notable feature of Goan cooking is that pork and vinegar is used, a rare sight in the rest of India. Vindaloo originated in Goa, and is traditionally cooked with pork, and in spite of its apparent popularity in Indian restaurants abroad, it is not common in India itself.\n\nTo the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["East (India)"],["East"]]}]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["West Bengal"],["Bengali"]]}]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Odisha"]]},"n food makes heavy use of rice, and fish due to the vast river channels and ocean coastline in the region. Bengali cooking is known for its complexity of flavor and bittersweet balance. Mustard oil, derived from mustard seeds, is often used in cooking and adds a pungent, slightly sweet flavour and intense heat. Bengalis prefer freshwater fish, in particular the iconic ilish or hilsa: it can be smoked, fried, steamed, baked in young plantain leaves, cooked with curd, aubergine and cumin seeds. It is said that ilish can be prepared in more than 50 ways. Typical Bengali dishes include ",{"type":"''","value":["maccher jhal"]},", a brothy fish stew which literally means \"fish in sauce\", and ",{"type":"''","value":["shorshe ilish"]}," (cooked in a gravy made from mustard seed paste). Eastern India is also famous for its desserts and sweets: Rasgulla is a famous variant of the better-known gulab jamun, a spherical morsel made from cow's milk and soaked in a clear sugar syrup. It's excellent if consumed fresh or within a day after it is made.",{"type":"''","value":["Sondesh"]}," is another excellent milk-based sweet, best described as the dry equivalent of ras malai.\n\nA lot of food has also filtered in from other countries.  ",{"type":"'''","value":["Indian Chinese"]}," (or ",{"type":"''","value":["Chindian"]},") is far and away the most common adaptation: most Chinese would barely recognize the stuff, but dishes like ",{"type":"''","value":["veg manchurian"]}," (deep-fried vegetable balls in a chilli-soy-ginger sauce) and ",{"type":"''","value":["chilli chicken"]}," are very much a part of the Indian cultural landscape and worth a try. The British left fish and chips and some fusion dishes like mulligatawny soup, while ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tibet"]]},"an and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nepal"]]},"i food, especially ",{"type":"''","value":["momo"]}," dumplings, are not uncommon in north India. Pizza has entered India in a big way, and the chains such as Pizza hut and Domino's have Indianised the pizza and introduced adaptations like paneer-tikka pizza. There is an Indian chain called Smokin Joe's, based in Mumbai, which has  mixed Thai curry with Pizzas.\n\nIt is, of course, impossible to do full justice to the range and diversity of Indian food in this brief section. Not only does every region of India have a distinctive cuisine, but you will also find that even within a region, castes and ethnic communities have different styles of cooking and often have their signature recipes which you will probably not find in restaurants. The adventurous traveller is advised to wangle invitations to homes, try various bylanes of the city and look for food in unlikely places like temples in search of culinary nirvana.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Fruits"]},"\n\nWhile there are a wide variety of fruits native to India such as the ",{"type":"''","value":["chikoo"]}," and the ",{"type":"''","value":["jackfruit"]},", nothing is closer to an Indians' heart than a juicy ripe mango. Hundreds of varieties are found across most of its regions — in fact, India is the largest producer, growing more than half the world's output. Mangoes are in season at the hottest part of the year, usually between May and July, and range from small (as big as a fist) to some as big as a small cantaloupe. It can be consumed in its ripe, unripe as well a baby form (the last 2 predominantly in pickles). The best mango (The king of mangoes as Indians call it) to be had is the \"Alphonso\" or Haapoos (in Marathi) in season in April and May along the western coast of Maharashtra. Buy it from a good fruit shop in Mumbai or Mahatma Phule market (formerly Crawford market) in South Mumbai. Other fruits widely available (depending on the season) are bananas, oranges, guavas, lychees, apples, pineapple, pomegranate, apricot, melons, coconut, grapes, plums, peaches and berries.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Vegetarian"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["Know your vegetarians"],[{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Vegmark.PNG"],["noframe"],["150px"],["right"]]},"\nMost Indians who practise vegetarianism do so for religious or cultural reasons — though cultural taboos have their roots in ethical concerns. Indians' dietary restrictions come in all shapes and sizes and the two symbols (see right) do not capture the full range. The Green dot means Pure Vegetarian.

But major cities, such as Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore, do have budding vegan societies and items such as tofu, soy chunks (branded Nutrela) and soy milk are readily available in major cities, as well as some minor ones. Eggs are considered non-vegetarian by many, though you are very likely to find people who are otherwise vegetarian eating eggs. These people are often referred to as ",{"type":"'''","value":["eggetarians"]},". That said, there are a number of foods that are vegan by default in India, including standard restaurant dishes such as aloo gobi, channa masala, various types of dal, dosas, and the vast majority of Indo-Chinese dishes. Dishes made with dairy products are usually denoted as such (referencing their use of butter or ghee, in particular). Most restaurants will accommodate dietary restrictions and it is advisable to ask if a dish contains milk, butter, cream, yogurt or ghee.

Owing to a large number of strictly vegetarian Hindus and Jains, Indian cuisine has evolved an astonishingly rich menu that uses no meat or eggs. The Jains in particular practice a strict form of vegetarianism based on the principles of non-violence and peaceful co-operative co-existence: Jains usually do not consume root vegetables such as potatoes, garlic, onions, carrots, radishes, cassava, sweet potatoes and turnips, as the plant needs to be killed prior to its end of normal life cycle, in the process of accessing these . At least half the menus of most restaurants are devoted to vegetarian dishes, and by law all packaged food products in India are tagged with a green dot (vegetarian) or red dot (non-veg). Veganism however is not a well-understood concept in India, and vegans may face a tougher time: milk products like cheese (",{"type":"''","value":["paneer"]},"), yogurt (",{"type":"''","value":["dahi"]},") and clarified butter (",{"type":"''","value":["ghee"]},") are used extensively, and honey is also commonly used as a sweetener. Milk in India is generally ",{"type":"''","value":["not"]}," pasteurized, and must be boiled before consumption.\n\nEven non-vegetarians will soon note that due to the Hindu taboo, ",{"type":"'''","value":["beef"]}," is generally not served (except in the Muslim and Parsi communities, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Goa"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kerala"]]}," and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Northeast India"],["North-Eastern states"]]},"), and ",{"type":"'''","value":["pork"]}," is also uncommon due to the Muslim population. Chicken and mutton are thus by far the most common meats used, although \"buff\" (water buffalo) is occasionally served in backpacker establishments. Seafood is of course ubiquitous in the coastal regions of India, and a few regional cuisines do use duck, venison and other game meats in traditional dishes.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Etiquette"]},"\n\nIn India eating with your hand (instead of cutlery like forks and spoons) is very common. There's one basic rule of etiquette to observe, particularly in non-urban India: ",{"type":"'''","value":["Use only your right hand"]},". The left hand is reserved for unhygienic uses. Don't stick either hand into communal serving dishes: instead, use the spatula with your left hand to serve yourself and then dig in. Needless to say, it's wise to wash your hands well before and after eating.\n \nFor breads for all types, the basic technique is to hold down the item with your forefinger and use your middle-finger and thumb to tear off pieces. The pieces can then be dipped in sauce or used to pick up bits before you stuff them in your mouth. Rice is more challenging, but the basic idea is to use four fingers to mix the rice in curry and pack a little ball, before you pop it in your mouth by pushing it with your thumb.\n\nMost of the restaurants do provide cutlery and its pretty safe to use them instead of your hand.\n\nEating by hand is frowned on in some \"classier\" places. If you are provided with cutlery and nobody else around you seems to be doing it, then take the hint.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Restaurants"]},"\n\nIndian restaurants run the gamut from roadside shacks (",{"type":"''","value":["dhabas"]},") to classy five-star places where the experience is comparable to places anywhere in the world.

Their patrons are usually the truckers, who happen to be overwhelmingly Punjabi. The authentic dhaba serves up simple yet tasty seasonal dishes like roti and dhal with onions, and diners sit on cots instead of chairs. Hygiene can be an issue in many dhabas, so if one's not up to your standards try another.  In rural areas, dhabas are usually the only option.\n\nIn Southern India, \"Hotel\" means a local restaurant serving south Indian food, usually a ",{"type":"''","value":["thali"]},"—a full plate of food that usually includes a kind of bread and an assortment of meat or vegetarian dishes—and prepared meals.\n\nAlthough you may be handed an extensive menu, most dishes are served only during specific hours, if at all.\n\nTipping is unusual outside of fancier restaurants where up to 10% is appropriate.

Both cost about ₹30-50 for a 600 ml bottle.\n\nAs for bottled water, make sure that the cap's seal has not been broken, otherwise, it is a tell tale sign of tampering or that unscrupulous vendors reuse old bottles and fill them with tap water, which is generally unsafe for foreign tourists to drink without prior boiling.  Bottled water brands like ",{"type":"''","value":["Aquafina"]}," (by PepsiCo) and ",{"type":"''","value":["Kinley"]}," (by Coca-Cola) are widely available.  Local brands like ",{"type":"''","value":["Bisleri"]}," are also acceptable and perfectly safe.  Tastes may vary due to the individual brands' mineral contents.

It's made by brewing up tea leaves, milk, and sugar altogether in a pot and keeping it hot until it's all sold.  ",{"type":"''","value":["Masala chai"]}," will also have spices added to the mix, such as cardamom, ginger, cinnamon, and black pepper.

It's also occasionally sold as \"special lassi\", but is usually easily spotted by the ₹30-50 price tag (several times higher than the non-special kinds). An important point to bear in mind is that the effects of \"Bhang\" are slow and heighten when consumed with something sweet. Also, first time users may want to wait a while before consuming too much in an effort to judge their tolerance.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nChoices vary widely depending on your budget and location.

Typically the staff includes a pensioned-off soldier as night watchman and perhaps another as gardener; often the gardens are lovely. Sometimes there is a cook.

A first encounter with a typical Indian highway will no doubt feature a traffic mix of lumbering trucks, speeding maniacs, blithely wandering cows and suicidal pedestrians, all weaving across a narrow, potholed strip of tarmac. To minimise your risk of becoming a grim statistic, use trains instead of buses, use government bus services instead of private ones (which are more likely to force their drivers into inhuman shifts), use taxis instead of auto-rickshaws, avoid travelling at night, and don't hesitate to change taxis or cars if you feel your driver is unsafe.\n\nOf significant concern is that much of the road network is significantly underdeveloped. Most roads are very poorly built and they are full of rubble, large cracks and potholes. Most road signs are not very reliable in the country, and in most cases provide drivers very confusing or inaccurate information.

Major operators with India-wide networks include ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bharti Airtel"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["Vodafone"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["BSNL"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["MTNL"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["Reliance Mobile"]}," (both GSM and CDMA), ",{"type":"'''","value":["TATA DOCOMO"]}," (GSM), ",{"type":"'''","value":["TATA Indicom"]}," (CDMA), ",{"type":"'''","value":["Idea Cellular"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["Uninor"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["Aircel"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["MTS"]}," (CDMA), and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Videocon Mobile"]},". Not all operators have Pan-India operations but have tie-ups with other operators to provide pan-India coverage via roaming, though roaming charges are higher. ",{"type":"'''","value":["You will not be able to use your mobile in Jammu and Kashmir since the local government does not allow any roaming and restricts foreigners from buying SIM cards there."]}," Local calls could cost as little as ₹0.10 per minute (typically ₹0.50), although going to a different state within India is considered roaming and additional charges of ₹1-3\/min for both incoming and outgoing calls may apply.  International calls are comparatively cheap, with most destinations under ₹10\/min, the same as you'd pay at a PCO booth.\n\nFully loaded prepaid starter kits are available for around ₹500 or less, including several hundred rupees of call time. Plain SIM cards are sold for as little as ₹10-15 while they are given out for free in many cases. You will need identification and a passport size photo, although some shops will also insist on a local address in India; try the next one if they're not accommodating. Although the best option is always buying a SIM card from the phone company's own store, that way you can verify the SIM card is working and you have been allocated your credit before you leave. Buying from smaller vendors will often mean a delay of a few hours to a few days before they call to get the SIM working, and you risk your SIM being cancelled if they never send in your identification paperwork.\n\nBeware that ",{"type":"'''","value":["talk time"]}," (unexpired minutes of talk time)  and ",{"type":"'''","value":["validity"]}," (the date that the SIM card expires) are considered separate and you have to keep ",{"type":"''","value":["both"]}," topped up, or otherwise you may find the ₹500 you just recharged disappearing in a puff of smoke when the one-month validity expires. Usually, when you extend the validity, you will also get extra minutes but you can buy minutes for less without extending the validity. Alternatively, if you are in India for a reasonably long time, you can buy a prepaid SIM with lifetime validity and then topup with talktime as per your needs. Please note that in most such cases, you will need to topup at least once every six months to keep the SIM active. And the term lifetime is slightly misleading as it refers to the life of the license issued to the operator by the Government of India to provide mobile services. If the license is renewed, your services shall continue without any additional charges but if the license is not renewed, your lifetime SIM also becomes defunct. Licenses are awarded to operators for a period of 20 years.\n\nBeware that whilst large telecommunications companies, such as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Airtel"]}," are technically the same company throughout India, and your SIM card will work anywhere have reception or a partnership, their sales and support teams are often outsourced and franchised. Meaning a SIM bought in one state (even from an official store) does not only attract a roaming charge when used in other states, it will also mean that your support numbers will not work. For example, if you buy a SIM in Goa and something goes wrong whilst you are travelling in another state, local stores will not be able to help you, nor often will your support number that came with your SIM. They will simply tell you to go back to the state you bought it in for support, or give you other numbers to try and call back in your purchase state.\n\nThis also impacts ",{"type":"'''","value":["recharging when you're outside the state you bought your SIM card"]},". Due to local taxes and company pricing, recharge cards (or the amount people pay to get the same about of talk time) differs from state to state - even though your per minute call costs will be the same state to state. Take note of the recharge options and prices in the state that you originally bought your SIM, because as you move to other areas in India, the local recharge options vary and will not apply to you (they'll only apply to SIM's bought in that state). For example, if you bought your SIM in Goa and to get ₹100 talk time credited to your account, you actually paid ₹120 (₹100 talk time + ₹20 local taxes), but then travelled to another state where they had a promotion where ₹100 talk time only costs ₹100, you are not eligible. You still have to pay the rates of where you bought your SIM, even if local signage says differently. The important thing to remember is that you always recharge based on where your SIM card is from, so take a note of the recharge options when you buy your SIM, and use them (not the local rates) to recharge. As an added complication, many local vendors do not like to recharge out of state SIM's (which they can tell from your number). This is because the way they recharge phones is by crediting a certain amount of rupees to your account, and then your carrier recognises the amount and transforms it into a service. For example ₹120 rupees may mean your account is recharged with ₹100 talk time, whereas ₹121 may mean you get a cricket SMS updates pack. Consequently, because local recharge shops do not know the prices to recharge in the state your SIM is from, they may not want to risk giving you something you do not want. The way to get around this is to, as mentioned, make a note of your recharge options when you buy your SIM and politely insist to local recharge merchants that you know that amount works.\n2G and 3G Internet prices are usually the same from state to state, making this process slightly easier.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Internet"]},"\n\nInternet kiosks are everywhere nowadays and they charge as low as ₹10-20 per hour (the cost being a compromise for speed). Beware of using your credit cards online as many cases have come forward regarding credit cards thefts using ",{"type":"''","value":["keyloggers"]},". More reliable chains include ",{"type":"''","value":["Reliance World"]}," (formerly ",{"type":"''","value":["Reliance Web World"]},") and ",{"type":"''","value":["Sify iWay"]},".\n\nCalling overseas is also very cheap if you use the many booths that advertise ",{"type":"''","value":["Net2Phone"]}," service. The quality ranges from tolerable to excellent, and the price is very good, with calls to the USA ranging from ₹2-5 per minute.\n\nWifi hotspots in India are, for most part, limited. The major airports and stations do offer paid wifi at around ₹60-100 an hour. Delhi, Bangalore, Pune and Mumbai are the only cities with decent wifi coverage. At Mumbai airport, you get to use WiFi internet free, for an hour or so.\n\nMost internet users in India do not rely on wifi too much.  GPRS datacards\/USB modems are widely used, but these require signing contracts with operators and thus not a practical option for short-term visitors without a residential address in India. The better companies such as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Airtel"]}," (GSM) and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Tata indicom"]}," (CDMA) do not ",{"type":"''","value":["rent"]}," datacards, which means that you have to buy them outright. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Reliance"]}," charges ₹650 per month (1GB downloading free, ₹2\/mb) for a datacard\/USB modem. The cheap price also means a 256 kbit\/s connection, by the way. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Airtel"]}," are the cheapest 3G data (for phone or data card) providers, at 10GB (valid for a month) for Rs.1250, and also much lower quantities. They have one of the largest networks and free India wide data roaming, but the drawback is particularly poor customer support, that often manage to make the problem worse.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["related"],["Indian_National_Parks_and_Wildlife_Sanctuaries"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["related"],["Sacred_sites_of_the_Indian_sub-continent"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["hasDocent"],["ravikiran_r"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["21.53485"],["78.04688"],["zoom=5"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["South Asia"]]}," \n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usablecountry"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:India"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:India"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Asia\/India\/"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["la:India"]]}]
