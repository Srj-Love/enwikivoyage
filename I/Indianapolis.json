The population within city limits is approximately 830,000, making it the 13th largest city in the US; the metropolitan area has about 2 million (23rd in the US). Efforts to beautify and modernize the city have brought Indianapolis into the 21st century as a world-class destination for everything from business meetings and trade conventions to backpackers making their way across the States.\n\nIndianapolis is known as the \"Racing Capital of the World\" due to the proximity of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, home of the Indy 500 and Allstate 400 at the Brickyard as well as the \"Amateur Sports Capital of America\" for hosting the NCAA. The city has several attractions outside of sports including museums, a large zoo, over 100 ethnic restaurants, several arts and historic districts, and a revitalized downtown. Although Indy has been mocked with the epithet \"India-noplace\", Indianapolis has several attractions for visitors, with a mix of both a large metropolitan city and a simple Midwestern community.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Indianapolis-indiana-from-above.jpg"],["alt=An aerial photograph of downtown Indianapolis"],["thumb"],["Indianapolis' downtown is cut through by the non-navigable waters of the White River"]]},"\nThe founders of Indianapolis expected it to be the \"Great Inland Port\", but they neglected to consider the fact that the White River is impossible to navigate most of the year; other than during the spring, it is a melange of sandbars and temporary islands. However, this port desire left the city with a beautiful canal district, though the canal itself is used only for recreational paddleboats and kayaks.\n\nInstead, Indianapolis is called the \"Crossroads of America\" due to its centrality in America's Interstate Highway System. The city is warm in the summer, with average highs in the mid-80s F (30°C) in June, July, and August. Indianapolis has a typical mid-western winter. January is the coldest month, with an average high of 34°F (1.1°C). Every few years, the winter gets sharp with significant snowfall and once a generation or so there is an ice storm or otherwise impassible winter weather event. Indianapolis exists within a tornado region but has never been impacted by major twisters. Travelers really only need to beware the occasional nasty winter and sometimes overly hot summer. The city has had two droughts since 1980, neither of which was disastrous.\n\nIn general, travel in and through Indianapolis is safe, clean, and logical. Visitors can always find something to do without becoming overwhelmed at a sprawling metropolis. In a few minutes, you can go from a sleepy and peaceful cornfield to a vibrant downtown.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Imperial"],["janhigh =35.6"],["febhigh =40.2"],["marhigh =51.7"],["aprhigh =63.4"],["mayhigh =72.8"],["junhigh =81.9"],["julhigh =85"],["aughigh =84"],["sephigh =77.6"],["octhigh =65.3"],["novhigh =52.2"],["dechigh =38.9"],["janlow =20.5"],["feblow =23.9"],["marlow =32.8"],["aprlow =42.7"],["maylow =52.6"],["junlow =62.1"],["jullow =65.8"],["auglow =64.4"],["seplow =56.2"],["octlow =44.7"],["novlow =35.1"],["declow =24.4"],["janprecip =2.66"],["febprecip =2.32"],["marprecip =3.56"],["aprprecip =3.81"],["mayprecip =5.05"],["junprecip =4.25"],["julprecip =4.55"],["augprecip =3.13"],["sepprecip =3.12"],["octprecip =3.12"],["novprecip =3.7"],["decprecip =3.17"],["jansnow =8.6"],["febsnow =6.5"],["marsnow =2.6"],["aprsnow =0.2"],["maysnow =0.0"],["junsnow =0.0"],["julsnow =0.0"],["augsnow =0.0"],["sepsnow =0.0"],["octsnow =0.4"],["novsnow =0.7"],["decsnow =6.9"],["jansun =9.68"],["febsun =10.62"],["marsun =11.87"],["aprsun =13.2"],["maysun =14.33"],["junsun =14.92"],["julsun =14.65"],["augsun =13.68"],["sepsun =12.38"],["octsun =11.07"],["novsun =9.93"],["decsun =9.38"],["description = Data from 1980–2010, ",{"type":"{{","value":[["ForecastNOAA"],["Indianapolis"],["39.76833"],["-86.15806"]]}]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Visitor Information"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Indianapolis Visitor Center"],["alt=Artsgarden"],["url=http:\/\/visitindy.com\/indianapolis-attractions-indianapolis-artsgarden-visitor-center"],["email="],["address=100 W.

A handful of streets cut across the city north–south and 10th and 38th Streets go across east–west. Washington Street (formerly part of the Old National Road) is the main east–west through street, which bends to the south on the westside and Meridian runs north–south far past the boundaries of the city.

It travels throughout the city and suburbs. Single fares are $1.75, day passes are available for $4, and all buses are equipped with two bike racks. The bus system is a very nice way to travel with the one exception of frequency—outside of rush hour routes, you can find yourself with a 30+ minute wait. Almost all routes travel from a locality in the outskirts of the city to the centrally-located bus stops downtown and back out; there are also a handful of smaller circulators and loops.

This world-class bike and pedestrian path marks an interconnectivity that no other city of Indianapolis' size can achieve, connecting the city's seven Cultural Districts, neighborhoods, and entertainment amenities, and serving as the downtown hub for the entire central Indiana greenway system. Starting in 2008, Mayor Greg Ballard announced a plan to make Indianapolis a bike-friendly city for those venturing out on open, and often busy, roads. The plan includes constructing 200 miles (322 km) of additional bike lanes throughout the next 15 years, many of which are already constructed.\n\nNote that motorists in Indianapolis are not known for being aggressive but it is still novel for many of them to share major roads with cyclists. Bike lanes are clearly marked but some drivers may encroach upon them. Also, while the Monon is a beautiful and well-traveled path, it is frequently unsafe at night—particularly north of Downtown. Solo biking along the trail at night is best avoided.\n\nIndyGo buses include two bike racks in the front for storing your cycle but if they are full, then you'll be out of luck.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Indiana Pacers Bikeshare"],["alt="],["url=https:\/\/www.pacersbikeshare.org\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=$8\/24 hours"],["content=Bike sharing program with 25 stations located on or near the Cultural Trail in downtown Indianapolis."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Taxi"]},"\nCabs are available including ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ycindy.com\/ Yellow Cab Indy"]}]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.indyairporttaxi.net\/ Indy Airport Taxi"]}]}," and are readily available mainly downtown and in Broad Ripple Village.
