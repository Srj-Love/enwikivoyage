[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Mena-asia_default_banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Indochina"]}," refers to a region in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southeast Asia"]]},". In the strictest sense of the word, it refers to the former ",{"type":"[[","value":[["France"],["French"]]}," colonies of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vietnam"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cambodia"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Laos"]]},", which were collectively known as French Indochina during the colonial period. However, the term is usually expanded to include ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Thailand"]]},", which was never colonised, and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Myanmar"]]},", a former ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United Kingdom"],["British"]]}," colony, as well, both of which share many cultural similarities with the other three countries, which include the dominance of Buddhism as the main religion, as well as the relatively heavy use of fish sause in the local cuisine. (Peninsular ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Malaysia"]]}," is sometimes included, but this usage is rare as it does not share the same cultural similarities as the other five; a better term to include peninsular Malaysia would be ",{"type":"'''","value":["mainland Southeast Asia"]},".)\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Southeast Asia"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["extraregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Indochina"]]}]
