Since the 1992 riots, the crime rate has been dropping, and also alongside with it murders. Contrary to misconceptions, Inglewood, although has a higher murder rate than the US national average, is the least likely crime to happen, and this murder average is only just because of its size and population (which is small). Rape is only slightly higher than the national average, so don't expect rape. However, robbery and assault are extremely high, and are much more higher than the national average, which give it a higher crime rate than average. At day time, gang activity is low and police patrol the streets high. At night time, be careful of your surroundings and avoid anyone acting suspicious. Avoid large groups of people wearing gang colors, and also avoid those who are \"high\", or on drugs or drunk at night. Most crime happens in the central part of the city, and the outer suburbs have a lower crime rate. Be careful when in the central neighborhoods (such as the City Center or the intersection between Crenshaw and Manchester Boulevards), the areas surrounding Lennox Boulevard and Burl Avenue, 104th Street and Crenshaw Boulevard and the area between Van Ness Avenue and the Imperial Freeway.
