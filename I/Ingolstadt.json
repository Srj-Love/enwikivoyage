Since one has to go there first by suburban train (",{"type":"''","value":["S-bahn"]},") line S1, which takes approx. 50 min, and then change there to get on a train to Ingolstadt it is a lot quicker and more convenient to take the bus. But, if you are a party of up to 5 people and travel on a tight budget after 21:00 you may consider taking the train,as there exists a cheap ticket (",{"type":"''","value":["Bayernticket"]},") for €25 (+4€ for every extra person up to a party of 5), which is valid for the S-bahn, the train and also some buses. Be aware, though, that you can not take an ICE or IC train with that ticket!\n\nFrom Munich Airport there is a bus called \"Airport Express X109\". A one-way ticket is €19 and a return ticket €31.
