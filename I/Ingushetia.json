By 1991, the first Ingush president, Ruslan Aushev attempted to help the already weak economy, and when the first Chechen war started, this created a tremendous problem for the economy. It collapsed after Aushev's success. However, he was forced to leave office when the second Chechen war started. Aushev also founded the city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Magas"]]},". \n\nBy 2002, Murat Zyazikov came into office, and since then the political and economic situation has worsened, and Zyazikov received harsh criticism for his disregard for human rights, corruption, and social and political problems. This was because of  alleged abductions, illegal beatings, unlawful arrests and killings of suspects by the federal forces and local police and allied paramilitaries. By 2008, a new president, Yunus-bek Yevkurov succeeded the unpopular Zyazikov and began a campaign into improving the situation in the region. \n\nThe poor situation in the republic has made it a magnet for terrorism for Chechen and Ingush rebels, and has continued to make it more uneasy for travelers to visit. The region is desperately very poor, where only 5 in 10 are employed and a large part of the people live in severe poverty and live below $US2 a day. At present there is little prospect of this changing.\n\nAlthough the majority of Ingushetia's population lives in the larger northern towns, the Ingush consider their true heritage to be tied to the ancient auls (stone mountaintop villages) in the south of Ingushetia, especially along the Assy Gorge.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nPlanes from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]}," (Vnukovo or Domodedovo airport) to Ingushetia ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Magas"]]}," (airport near Ordzhonekidzovskaya).\nAlternative routes: Beslan airport in North Ossetia and Grozny airport in Chechnya.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nA couple of trains per week connect ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]},"'s Kazanskiy Station with Nazran (40 h).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nA daily bus leaved from Moscow (Paveletski or Kazanski railroad station) to Nazran (total trip time over 24 hours).\nA daily bus leaves from\/to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Grozny"]]},",",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nalchik"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Stavropol"]]},".\nRegular buses leaves from\/to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]}," .\nA small buses leaves from\/to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nalchik"]]}," and other north-caucasians,south-russians cities(i.e.,to Vladikavkaz).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nTaxi, buses\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russian phrasebook"],["Russian"]]}," is understood by all, as well as the official language, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ingush phrasebook"],["Ingush"]]},".

Like in the Soviet times both Ingushetia and Chechnya are considered foreign visitors' restricted areas. \nWhen you are in Ingushetia you have to register with the local branch of the Russian Federal Security Bureau (FSB) to avoid any trouble. If you are a foreigner your presence in Ingushetia is tightly monitored by the FSB. Your cell phone is tapped and location is detected at all times via GPS tracking. Due to mistrust to the local police force there are many Russian FSB agents and Russian troops from different parts of Russia in Ingushetia. The troops are there on the temporary basis that is why be prepared to pay them bribes, it is a common practice in Russia especially on the roads, at the police checkpoints to avoid detention which can substantially slow you down. It is better to have an Ingush local to negotiate, because you do not know the rates of the bribes in different situations. Do not show the large sums of money (more than $100) to the troops they might confiscate them and you will never recover them back. Foreign documents must not be shown in public either. If you are a male visitor do not grow a beard you might be taken for an Ingush rebel and accidentally detained at best. Do not speak foreign language, let the local do the talking. For most troops if you are a citizen of the West countries you are most likely suspected in spying, be aware of it and act respectively. Do not provoke the soldiers by making pictures near the checkpoints even if they are located in beautiful areas. Journalist who have the FSB permit to report in Ingushetia should always ask Russian troops' permission to make pictures near the checkpoints. Do not display American\/British\/Georgian flags or any other American\/British\/Georgian attributes to the Russian troops it will only provoke them. Most of the \"Assa\" hotel staff, and the local inhabitants are very well aware of the situation in the republic, and are likely to offer you a lot of help especially if you are a foreigner in need. It is unwise to take a stroll alone by yourself at night. Though no attack of the Ingush rebels on the foreign visitors were ever recorded the people do disappear after the FSB raids. Generally, most staff from hotels will accompany you to avoid any trouble. Remember, you are prohibited from going to the mountains in Ingushetia by the FSB. You need to have a permit even if you are a Russian citizen to go there. \n\nA tight security situation is present, and at all checkpoints, they are likely to pull you over if you drive in a vehicle with darkened windows. It is illegal to have darkened windows in Ingushetia due to the war zone situation.  The security will search your vehicle for suspicious items (large sums of money, large amounts of alcohol, drugs, weapons, explosives, etc.)\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\nDo not drink pipe water.

Ingushetia is somewhat a traditionally conservative region with Islamic customs. Even though the region is predominantly Islamic, there is no dress code in effect and most of the locals, even the women are highly westernized. However, some women prefer to wear a veil, but it doesn't really apply to female visitors. \nThe locals in general are interested in getting to know about foreigners, and are generally helpful to visitors around this volatile region. As said, Ingush locals treat visitors like guests, and don't throw this opportunity away. Likewise, always keep political opinions to yourself to avoid any danger.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Mobile"]},"\nIn Ingushetia there are three federal GSM operators (MTS, Beeline, Megafon) and they often have offers that give you a SIM card for free or at least very cheap. If you are planning to stay a while and to keep in touch with Ingushetian and other North-Caucasus people, then you should consider buying a local SIM card instead of going on roaming. To buy a SIM card from a shop you'll need your passport for identification. It only takes five minutes to do the paperwork and it will cost less than $10.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Ingushetia"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["43.2000"],["44.9667"],["scale=1000000"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["North Caucasus"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]}]
