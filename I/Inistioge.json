It has a continental feel to it. Despite the economic boom which Ireland experienced Inistioge's essential charm remains unblemished. Any new housing estates are tucked away down a side road. It's centre is a lovely cosy square. If you have seen the films \"Circle of Friends\" or \"Widow's Peak\", you have got a sneak preview of Inistioge for they were filmed here. From the square a street rises steeply bringing you towards the old Woodstock Estate. Inistioge is unusual in that both the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic church sit side by side opposite the square on your right hand side as you enter from Kilkenny. Indeed as you enter from the Kilkenny side there are lovely flower beds on the sweep of the bend before the village. Between Thomastown and Inistioge before you cross the river Nore there is a most magnificent panoramic view. For a spectacular view of Inistioge itself, stop just before the gates into the Woodstock Estate and look to your left. Fabulous. Another lovely view of Inistioge is to cross the river and look back from the other side. Postcard stuff.  The local post office is in the square. The nearest Garda station is in Thomastown which is five miles away. There is a supermarket opposite the church. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nInistioge is on the R700 between Kilkenny City and New Ross.
