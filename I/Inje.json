When spring comes, the thick ice of the valleys starts to melt. The Lenok, which is a type of salmon, starts to swim upstream to lay eggs. When you notice scarlet royal azaleas blossom along the stream and the water becomes cobalt blue, you can say summer has come. When fall comes in the valley, red and yellow leaves reflected on the surface of the stream seem to dye the water red and yellow.
