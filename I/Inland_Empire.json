The boundaries are often a subject of debate, however, it is generally agreed that the western boundary is the San Bernardino\/Los Angeles County line and the eastern limits are the most urbanized areas of San Bernardino and Riverside counties. The population of the Inland Empire is over 4 million residents. When taken as the Greater Los Angeles Area, which stretches from the western edge of Ventura County to the eastern boundary of the Inland Empire, this region has a combined population of 17 million. The Inland Empire has its roots in agriculture, primarily citrus and wine-making.

These cities all lie in San Bernardino or Riverside counties. The Palm Springs area, which also lies in Riverside County in \"the high desert\", is farther east and is considered part of Coachella Valley. The High Desert is generally not considered part of the I.E.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Inlandempire citrusgrove.jpg"],["thumb"],["Citrus groves used to dominate the landscape of the IE."]]}," Native Americans called the Inland Empire home for thousands of years before the arrival of European explorers in the 18th century. Residents would spend winters in the warmer valleys and move into the cooler mountains during summer months. \n\nThroughout much of the 19th and 20th century, agriculture was the dominant industry for the region. The post-World War II decades saw an explosion of residents and industry as developers turned to cheap land east of Los Angeles. Although the area is often criticized for its sprawling developments that are incredibly automobile-dependent, in recent years many cities have made an effort to encourage denser housing developments centered around commercial and office-park developments. Today, the region's growth continues as housing prices remain incredibly affordable and residents from Orange and Los Angeles counties swell the area's population.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nLike the rest of California and the nation, English is the main language spoken. But like many American regions that border Mexico, Spanish is widely spoken by some residents as well as some employees at restaurants, stores, and businesses. That being said, there are certainly many parts of the region where knowing some basic Spanish will go a long way in helping you receive better service at restaurants and businesses. Some residents, however, advocate the opposite, feeling that those who speak only Spanish can give and receive better service by learning some basic English.\n\nThe Inland Empire is highly populated, containing 4.2 million residents. However, the area isn't as totally self-sufficient in the regard that many residents still commute to their jobs in the adjacent Los Angeles metropolitan area of Los Angeles and Orange counties. Inland Empire residents also tend to travel to Los Angeles and its immediate environs for activities such as zoos, aquariums, theme parks, planetariums, higher-rated museums, and such. This isn't to say the Inland Empire is without its own attractions as its has some good theatres, nearby mountains, lakes, and enjoyable restaurants and malls. But it does show that the Inland Empire is not just a stand alone metropolitan area, but also an integrated part of the Greater Los Angeles area.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["LA\/Ontario International Airport (ONT)"]}," is the main airport for the Inland Empire.

Interstate 10, the main route, connects downtown Los Angeles with San Bernardino. Interstate 210 and State Route 210 connect Pasadena and the San Fernando Valley with San Bernardino and Redlands. State Route 60 connects downtown Los Angeles with downtown Riverside. \n\nIn addition, the almost always-congested State Route 91 freeway connects many Orange County Cities with Riverside. Two north-south freeways also traverse the region. Interstate 15 connects San Diego to Las Vegas via Corona and the western Inland Empire cities. Interstate 215 forms a loop through the eastern cities, from San Bernardino south to Riverside, Perris, and Murrieta.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Greyhound"]}," serves many Inland Empire Cities. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe Inland Empire is incredibly car-dependent. However, there are still ways to enjoy the region without having a car if you are willing to be flexible and patient.

Some lines, such as the Riverside Line, have no weekend service at all.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nMuch of the Inland Empire is laid out in a grid-like pattern, making navigation very easy. In addition, streets maintain their names as they cross city boundaries, which helps reduce confusion. \nBecause many Inland Empire residents commute towards Los Angeles and Orange counties for work, westbound traffic is heaviest in the morning (between 7 and 9AM) and eastbound is heaviest in the evening (between 4 and 7PM). Friday traffic can be a nightmare, especially on long weekends, as many Southern California residents flock to Las Vegas. However, some simple day-planning can help you avoid driving on freeways during rush hour and will make your experience more enjoyable.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bicycle"]},"\nAlthough mountains sit nearby, much of the Inland Empire is flat enough to encourage bicycle riding. Many major thoroughfares have marked bike lanes, and numerous projects are converting abandoned rail lines to paved bike trails. Although bike use is low compared to other urbanized areas, high gas prices are resulting in more and more cyclists using the bike lanes throughout the area.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Ontario Mills Mall"],["url=http:\/\/www.simon.com\/mall\/default.aspx?ID=1258"],["email="],["address=One Mills Circle, Ontario, CA 91764"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=SEC Miliken Ave\/4th St"],["phone = +1 909  484-8300"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=One of North America's largest indoor malls, Ontario Mills hosts numerous outlet stores and massive weekend crowds."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Victoria Gardens"],["url=http:\/\/www.victoriagardensie.com\/"],["email="],["address=12505 North Mainstreet, Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91739"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=NEC Foothill Blvd\/Day Creek Blvd"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=A large outdoor mall designed to resemble America's \"Main Street,\" Victoria Gardens contains many upscale stores and restaurants."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Route 66"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Historic Route 66 (\"Foothill Blvd\" or \"5th Street\") passes through many Inland Empire cities.
