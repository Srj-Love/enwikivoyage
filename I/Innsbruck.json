Many old buildings from the Middle Ages and modern times survived in the heart of old town.\n\nThe city is well known for its sporting opportunities, especially alpine sports, as it is in the Alps and surrounded by mountains. Several ski resorts are situated inside the city territory or within short distance. Innsbruck was one of the centers of snowboard boom in the 1990s and the derived distinct subculture endured until today. The population of skateboarders, snowboarders and people alike is therefore above average and nothing unusual to the people. This culture is also celebrated by a lot of events in and around Innsbruck especially in the winter season, attracting (predominantly young) people from all around the world.\n\nThere are two universities and several colleges in Innsbruck, with over 25,000 students altogether, (including a significant Italian population) making the city's nightlife very lively.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Climate"]},"\nInnsbruck's fair distance from the coast and altitude lead to a continental climate. \nWinters are cold and snowy; \nsummers are generally warm, with highly variable weather.

All buses and trams are modern low-floor vehicles. A major extension of the tram network is currently carried out (it ist the line to the technical university campus, first phase to be completed in autumns 2012)\n\nVisitors should be aware that there sometimes are bus lines that split up into different destinations (the bus line O, for example), and so it's important to pay attention to the destination displays (outside and inside) and the spoken announcements. Single-fare tickets are €2.00 in the city fare zone if paid by the driver or €1.80 if purchased at ticket machines. Regardless of the door you enter, go to the driver and pay, exact change not necessary. 24-hour tickets, weekly tickets and other sorts of tickets are only offered at multi-language ticket machines to be found at many stations. They can also be purchased at the identically looking machines for short-term parking tickets.

The line passes the uplands with vast forests and gives some spectacular prospects for travelers either on Innsbruck or on the lovely landscape between Aldrans and Igls. It provides stops immediately near Schloß Ambras and the bathing-lake Lansersee (ice skating in Winter is also possible there). The terminus Igls lies within the city fare zone, so no additional ticket is needed. From there it is just a fine 10 Minutes walk to the Patscherkofel Ropeway.\n\nTram line STB is 18 kilometers long and connects Innsbruck with several villages in the Stubaital valley. This tram provides also access to Bergisel (Tirol Panorama) at the station Sonneburgerhof. This station is also situated within die city fare zone. In Mutters, Nockhofweg access to an easy skiing area, the Mutteralm, is provided (10 Minutes walk). A beautiful hour's ride will take you at least the small town of Fulpmes. The new red liveried trams offer great scenic views on the journey.

Tip: The Innsbruck card is pretty expensive, €29\/€34\/€39 for 1\/2\/3 day cards. And daily or weekly public transport cards are cheap - the \"all inclusive\" sales pitch is alluring to disoriented travelers, but make sure the discounts are worth the initial price. If you are not seeing these major entrance-fee sites, remember that you may buy more than one daily card at a time, as the 24 hours only starts once validated.
