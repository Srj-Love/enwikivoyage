[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["TT Banner.jpg"],["notoc=true"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Internet access"]}," has become a basic need for many leisure travelers. You may be glad to be free of it for a while, but keeping in contact with family and friends can be cumbersome without it. It is essential for most business travelers, and there's no doubting the value of accessing Wikivoyage.org for information wherever you are in the world.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nTravellers have a wide variety of expectations and expertise regarding the Internet.  Some will carry a device with them, such as a laptop or a phone, and they are just looking for a means to connect it.  Some need to be online as much as possible, whereas others may be happy to check their email every week or so.\n\nThis article gives an overview of what options there are for travellers to connect to the Internet while travelling.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Access types"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Public-access computers"]},"\n\nThe simplest form of access for the broadest range of users are computers made available to the public, usually for a fee or included as a service for patrons of a hotel, restaurant, or cafe.

The newer ",{"type":"'''","value":["UMTS"]}," standard and its enhancements ",{"type":"'''","value":["HSDPA"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["HSPA+"]}," are also widely available. Yet another, even faster standard named ",{"type":"'''","value":["LTE"]}," has become widespread since 2013. While GPRS offers basic modem speeds suitable for email and some browsing (particularly text-heavy rather than graphics-heavy sites), the newer technologies offer speeds comparable to fixed-line broadband. Most modern GSM phones, even very cheap models, are GPRS enabled, and current smartphones are at least HSDPA enabled. Using mobile internet services may require activation with the provider.\n\nAdditionally, many smartphones can use wireless Internet (WiFi, see below).\n\nSmartphones and their apps may generate quite a lot of Internet traffic on their own, such as by checking status or downloading updates, or the web browser downloading content never actually shown. Thus, if you enable Internet access, you are not going to pay only for your concious Internet use. It may be worth checking how to minimize the \"extra\" Internet access. When using the phone as modem, this applies also to programs on your laptop.\n\nThere are two basic ways of using Internet with your phone:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Use mobile internet to download mail directly to your phone and surf the web. While this ",{"type":"''","value":["can"]}," be done on most any modern phone, you will want an iPhone\/Android\/Windows Phone-type device with a large screen to make this practical.

In ",{"type":"[[","value":[["European Union"],["EU"]]}," there are maximum prices, as long as you use an EU based SIM card and network (be careful in border regions and at sea).\n\nIn the USA and Canada, CDMA (the system used by Verizon and TELUS) is widespread, and arguably the most available service outside of metropolitan areas. CDMA phones can frequently be used as a computer modem with the purchase of an adapter cable, or increasingly they can provide Internet access to your laptop via their built-in Bluetooth. While not part of their basic cell phone service package, Verizon's \"Quick 2 Connect\" service provides 14.4 kbit\/s Internet access at no additional charge to their customers using the phone and cable combination, and their BroadbandAccess and NationalAccess packages with additional laptop tethering add-on can be used to provide Internet access through many of their current phones.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Prepaid mobile internet"]},"\nPrepaid internet plans on mobile devices are increasingly becoming more affordable and a local one may be far cheaper than roaming Internet access by your normal provider.  With two providers you will have two SIM cards, which means you need to change back and forth to be reachable by your normal phone number, unless you have two devices or a dual SIM phone.\n\nIf you have a laptop, you can buy a mobile broadband modem (\"connect card\", \"USB dongle\" or similar) for the 3G SIM and leave the phone alone.  Some smart phones may also be able to use such an external device for Internet connections.  Otherwise you might consider buying a cheap second phone to use for calls from people at home (or all calls).  In that case you want to find out how to transfer contact information between the phones (maybe by storing it on the SIM card).\n\nIf your phone is locked to your carrier back home, there are plenty of mobile phone shops that can unlock it for you at a reasonable price (the warranty may become void though).  Dongles you got with an Internet connection can probably be unlocked in a similar fashion.\n\nFor best results, purchase a prepaid 3G SIM card in the country you are visiting.  The prepaid internet plans come in the form of purchasing data bundles for a fixed price good for a certain number of days.  An example of a plan is 200 MB for 3 days available for $4.  You usually need to key-in something on your mobile phone (via the dialling keypad) or send an SMS.  The cost is immediately deducted from your prepaid credits and service becomes active instantly.  Check with the mobile provider if one day is equivalent to 24 hours or is good until midnight.  If the provider says one day is defined to last until midnight regardless of when activation happened, it's best to purchase the plan first thing in the morning.\n\nMost plans that feature more than 30 MB for at least one day is more than enough for mobile internet surfing, just make sure you go easy on the graphics.  If you however wish to use a mobile tablet computer like an iPad, you may want to go with a heavier data plan; getting a micro-SIM card (as opposed to the normally used \"mini\" size) is also required.\n\nOnce a plan is purchased, the only thing you will have to worry about is to ensure your device has sufficient battery life.  Some smart phones can run out of battery very quickly especially if 3G functionality is on.  Finding a place to charge your mobile device can be very difficult outside your hotel and most restaurants\/snack shops are not very open to the idea of patrons charging their device.  Coffeeshops like Starbucks are an exception and won't mind as long as you buy some food or a beverage from them.  If free Wifi is available and your device is capable of Wifi, you can save battery by switching-off the 3G capabilities of your phone and turning-on Wifi.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Wired Ethernet"]},"\n\nVirtually all laptops manufactured in the past decade have provisions for wired Ethernet.  Otherwise USB Ethernet sticks can be purchased from computer stores.  Pack an Ethernet cable.\n\nSome hotel rooms and some other locations will provide standard RJ-45 Ethernet jacks which you can plug your computer into.  Mostly a local server will tell your computer its IP address and other connection details, so that the connection is set up automatically.\n\nInternet cafés, libraries, etc. may not allow this kind of access, instead offering public access computers or Wi-Fi (see the next session).\n\nIronically however, high-class business hotels are more likely to charge for wired Internet and at really high rates.  Choose at least a 24-hour or one-day rate as hotels charge less than two to three times the hourly rate (e.g. the hotel may offer Internet of $15 good for 1 hour but also $25 good for 24 hours, in this case choose the latter).  Savings by buying access for several days at once are smaller, but may be cost-effective if you are going to use the connection every day.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Wi-Fi"]},"\n\nVirtually all laptops and PDAs manufactured since the mid-2000s, as well as most smart phones launched in the late 2000s have Wi-Fi (WLAN) provisions.  The downside of Wi-Fi is that even if it is wireless in nature, the coverage of a Wi-Fi access point or hotspot is limited compared to that of mobile internet.  Once you leave the building, you also lose the Wi-Fi signal provided to you.

Such commercial access points are growing increasingly common, especially in areas where travellers are 'trapped' (airports for example).

Check the cost as, paying per minute, your \"call\" can be quite expensive, especially if a long-distance or international call is required to access your ISP. Using hotel phone lines can be ludicrously expensive.\n\nMany countries use nonstandard connectors for telephone lines, and you may need to buy an adapter between the jack on your laptop (the shape of which is called RJ-11) and the jack used where you are staying.  Sometimes you can borrow the adapter used on the room telephone, and other times you must provide your own. Some hotels use their own private digital phone switches, which will not work with analog modems. The phones may be hard-wired, or the sockets impossible to get at.\n\nIf you are staying in private accommodation with phone access, or having an extended stay, it may be possible to get an account with a ",{"type":"'''","value":["local ISP"]},". Dialup accounts can be very cheap at around US$10 per month or less. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Pre-paid"]}," dialup is a good solution, as since you will not provide ongoing billing details there is definitely no risk of ongoing charges. Otherwise some flat-rate ISPs may be ",{"type":"'''","value":["no contract"]},", meaning you can cancel at any time; however you need to remember to cancel!\n\nIf you are traveling internationally, it is possible to set up a \"global roaming\" dialup account that has local access numbers in numerous countries.  Depending on the location, there is often a choice between local numbers and country-wide toll-free numbers, the toll-free numbers costing more per hour in Internet fees.  Before leaving, you will want to make sure the global roaming \"dialer\" software is loaded on to your computer, and that you can connect successfully from your home.  Doing so will also ensure the most recent list of local access numbers gets downloaded onto your laptop.\n\nA global roaming provider has contracts with a network of local Internet service providers in each country, rather than operating a worldwide network itself.  With any such provider, hourly rates vary by country and depend on whether you use a local or national access number. Before considering signing up for any type of global dialup roaming, ensure that the service provider offers service in the countries you intend to visit.\n\nSome places may not support \"touch tone\" dialing.  If after your modem dials, you continue to hear the dial tone (which could sound different where you are visiting) instead of getting a connection, change the settings on your computer to use \"pulse\" dialing.\n\nMany modems don't recognize the dial tone in other countries.  If your modem reports \"no dial tone\" you should disable dial tone detection on your modem, usually by adding ATX0 to the modem initialisation string.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Wireless modems "]},"\n\nWireless modems are also becoming widely available.  These modems are plugged to a desktop or laptop computer via a USB port and will receive a signal from a mobile phone provider, in the same way as if you were using your mobile phone as a modem.  A program to connect to the Internet usually starts-up automatically after plugging.  If not, printed instructions to install software are provided.  These modems should use standard USB protocols, though, and thus be usable with the operating system support alone.\n\nOftentimes modems are locked to a particular mobile provider and you must purchase the modem and a data SIM card (either prepaid or plan) as a bundle.  SIM cards and top-up\/recharge chards are usually available at convenience stores, from the provider's service centre or authorised dealer.  Mobile broadband plans on a PC are generally affordable and can come as either time-bound or data-bound plans or both.  For instance time-bound plans will last you for several hours or days while data-bound plans give you allowance of several hundred megabytes or a few gigabytes.  Once your time is up or you have consumed the allowed data of your plan, the service is terminated or you may be charged at the \"pay as you go rate\" which is much more expensive than the bundled rates.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Accessing email"]},"\n\nIn many countries it is easier to use ",{"type":"'''","value":["email"]}," to keep in touch with friends and family back home than it is to call home regularly. Email has advantages over phone calls: it doesn't require you to account for time zone differences before contacting your family, it doesn't cost any more to send e-mail around the world than down the street, and it's possible to contact many people with a single email.  Just make sure that the recipients check their email regularly or let them know you will be sending them email from time to time.  \n\nAnother advantage of email is that messages are easy to document.  This comes in handy when you need written proof of accommodations or other arrangements as you can just print it out from a shop or save it on your smart phone.  \n\nWebmail provides access to your email over a web interface, and is necessary if you are going to be accessing email from a variety of locations and equipment.  An increasing number of email providers such as ISPs are setting up webmail interfaces for their users so that they can check their mail on the road. But many people choose to use one of the dedicated webmail providers, many of whom provide a free service.\n\nSome web access points will restrict access to sites known to host webmail. Examples include some research libraries, universities and private businesses who wish to discourage users from checking their personal email during work hours. However, almost all Internet cafes and other access points aimed at the public will allow you to access your webmail: for many of their users, webmail is the reason they are there.\n\nUsing dedicated email software like Outlook, Lotus Notes or Thunderbird or the Mac's Mail.app may be restricted if your ISP or the access point blocks access or requires access through a proxy server.  \n\nWith prepaid mobile internet plans becoming increasingly affordable, you can buy a local SIM card and insert it into your phone.  There are plans that can be tailor-made to popular mobile email devices like a Blackberry.

However, many websites where this might be a concern — such as banks and corporate sites — make use of encryption to prevent eavesdropping and make it possible for you to notice connection hijacking. Use https for any sensitive web connections (look for the ending \"s\" in \"https:\" at the start of the address and the key icon in your web browser conveying to you that your connection is encrypted and the address of the site your connected to is certified as being the one it claims to be). The web browser does not know where you want to connect, however, so note the real address at home and look out for similar looking but different ones, such as banking.example.net instead of banking.example.com or any misspellings in the name. Take seriously any warnings your browser may give about insecure certificates.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Public computer security "]},"\n\nIf you are using a public computer, a common threat to a traveler's internet security is key loggers and other programs designed to monitor the user's activity for information that can be exploited, such as online banking passwords, credit card numbers, and other information that could be used for identity theft.  For this reason public internet terminals (such as those found at libraries, hotels, and internet cafes) should not be used to make online purchases, or access banking information.\n\nIf a traveler must use their online banking or send credit card information using a public terminal the following precautions should be taken:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Check for virus and spyware scanning software on the computer, and ensure it is enabled."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Talk to your bank ahead of time, many banks can enable limits on your online banking profile that, for example, restrict the ability to transfer money to third parties who have not been pre-approved."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Obtain a credit card with a provider that can issue you temporary, one-shot credit card numbers specifically for use in online purchases."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Always be certain you have logged out of your online banking, and shutdown\/restart the computer before walking away."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Circumventing censorship"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Types of censorship"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Content filters"]},"\n\nSome Internet cafes and Internet providers may restrict access to certain websites based on ",{"type":"'''","value":["content"]},". Common restricted content includes: sexual content, content unsuitable for children, commercial competitors and political content of certain types. The blocks can be wide-ranging, blocking for example, any site that includes the word \"breast\". With some misfortune any site might be blocked by mistake. They may also block access to certain types of traffic, for example web (HTTP or HTTPS), e-mail (POP or IMAP), remote shell (SSH).\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Political firewalls"]},"\n\nSeveral countries (for example ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China"]]},") have a policy of blocking access to different areas of the internet at a country level. The description below is based on ",{"type":"[[","value":[[":WikiPedia:Great_Firewall_of_China"],["China's"]]}," access policy, but applies to several other countries (such as Cuba, Myanmar, Syria, South Korea, North Korea, Iran, Thailand, Singapore, ...).\n\nTypically the following sites may be blocked: human-rights NGOs' sites; opposition sites; universities; news outlets (BBC, CNN, etc.); blogging or discussion forums; webmail; search engines; and proxy servers. Often they will duplicate the sites that have been blocked but (not so) subtly modify the content.  Pages or URLs containing certain banned keywords may also be blocked.\n\nNote that blocking may not be limited to stopping you from seeing certain pages: if you trespass on a blocked page in China, other sites may also be temporarily blocked for up to 30 minutes.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["IP geofiltering"]},"\n\nAn increasing number of services on the internet are restricted to IP address ranges corresponding to a certain country. If you try to access those services from outside that country, you will be blocked. Examples include video-on-demand (Movielink, BBC iplayer, Channel 4), web radio (Pandora), and News. Content providers want to make sure their service is only available to residents within its legislation, usually to avoid possible copyright breaches in other countries. IP geofiltering is a simple, if somewhat crude way of achieving this. For travellers this can be very frustrating, since the system discriminates based on where your computer is located, not on who you are and where you live. So even if you have legitimately signed up for a movie rental service in the US, you can no longer use it while you are spending a week in the UK.\n\nFortunately there are straightforward ways of getting around IP-geofiltering. Your best option is to re-route your internet traffic to an IP address in your country of origin. The service will then think that your computer is located there and allow access. One way of doing this is to sign up with a VPN provider. See below for details.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["VoIP blocking"]},"\n\nCertain internet providers and hotels around the world have started the practice of blocking all VoIP traffic from their networks. Though they usually justify this with esoteric explanations such as \"to preserve network integrity\", the real reason is normally much simpler: VoIP allows travellers to make free or very cheap phone calls over the internet, and the authority\/company in question wants to force the user to make expensive phone calls over its plain old telephone land line. In the worst case, VoIP traffic can be blocked in a whole country (this tends to happen in countries with a state telephone monopoly). Saudi Arabia is an example for this.\n\nThe best anti-VoIP-blocking measure currently available to an average traveller is a VPN provider (see below). Make sure that you choose a VPN provider with sufficient bandwidth, otherwise your phone calls may suffer from poor quality\/disconnects\/delay.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Getting access"]},"\n\nIn general, if using someone else's connection you will need to be careful about evading their filters. Doing so will almost certainly end your contract to use it if you're discovered evading a firewall through a connection you're paying for, and might upset someone even if you aren't. In some areas evading firewalls may be a criminal offence; this even applies in some Western countries when evading content filters aimed at blocking pornographic content.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Proxy servers"]},"\n\nThe most common (and straight-forward) way to avoid blocks on certain websites is to connect to a proxy server and have that proxy server connect to the blocked site for you. However, the organisations doing the blocking know this, and regularly block access to the proxy servers themselves. If you are likely to need access to sites which are commonly blocked at your destination, it is most likely that you will be able to get access through an unadvertised proxy server you set up yourself or have a friend set up for you. There is a risk if you search for too many 'naughty' keywords (like 'counter revolution') you'll get the proxy taken down or blocked. Proxies that use encrypted protocol (such as https or ssh) are immune to this however, but the protocols themselves are sometimes blocked.\n\nSome gateways (for example, that in China) are much more sophisticated than this: even when using a proxy server many sites are not accessible. One workaround is to use an ",{"type":"'''","value":["ssh tunnel"]}," to connect to a proxy server outside the country via an ssh server, from a local port (e.g. 4321), then to connect to the proxy server like that.\n\nIf you're interested in seeing what might be blocked from inside the firewalls before you leave, it is sometimes possible to surf through a proxy server in the country you're going to be going to.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Personal VPN providers"]},"\n\nPersonal VPN (virtual private network) providers are an excellent way of circumventing both political censorship and commercial IP-geofiltering. They are superior to web proxies for several reasons: They re-route all internet traffic, not only http. They normally offer higher bandwidth and better quality of service. They are encrypted and thus harder to spy on. They are less likely to be blocked than proxy servers.\n\nMost VPN providers work like this: You sign up with the provider who gives you an account name and password. Then you use a VPN program to logon to their server. This creates an encrypted tunnel that re-routes your internet traffic to that server. Prices range from €5-50 per month ($7-70), depending on bandwidth and quality. You might also have access to a VPN network of your workplace or university.\n\nLoging on to a VPN is very straight forward on Windows machines since they have a built-in VPN program. As long as you know your username, password, and server address, you are likely to be able to use VPN from most internet cafes. Since VPN is encrypted, there is no way for the connection provider to filter the sites you are accessing. However, VPN offers no protection against snooping software installed on the computer itself, so it's always a better idea to use it from your own laptop.\n\nVPNs are routinely used by millions of business travellers to connect securely to their office computers or to access company documents. Therefore they are tolerated in all but the most repressive dictatorships. It is unlikely that simply connecting to a VPN will attract attention in China for instance.  Since VPN providers are niche companies, it is also unlikely that their IP addresses are blocked. Warning: In a small number of autocratic regimes (Cuba, Iran) the mere usage of VPN is illegal and can land you in prison, no matter what you use it for.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Tor"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["https:\/\/torproject.org Tor"]}]}," is a worldwide network of encrypted, anonymizing web proxies. It is designed primarily for the purpose of making an internet user untraceable by the owner of the site he\/she visits. However, it can also be used for circumventing filters and firewalls. Unlike other methods explained in this section, Tor automatically rotates the servers used to access the internet, making it harder to discover your identity. However, there are only around 3000 Tor servers in the world, and their IP addresses are public knowledge, making it easy for governments and organizations to block them. Even so, new Tor servers join the network all the time, and if you wait patiently, you may connect to one that isn't blocked yet. Although the Tor Project introduced a function which allows for connection to unlisted bridges (no public database), preventing oppressive governments from easily blocking TOR.\n\nUsing Tor requires installation of software and usually also a plug-in for the browser.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["SSH access"]},"\n\nSSH (Secure Shell) is a good way of tunneling traffic other than http. However, you will normally need access to a server to use SSH. If not provided by your university, this can be expensive.

If much junk gets through with your current settings, you could change the threshold, such that only real mail gets through, and check the folder for possible junk only when you have a good connection. You might want to temporarily unsubscribe from some high volume email lists.\n\nWith more elaborate options, you can direct non-urgent mail (such as that of many mailing list) to separate folders, likewise to be checked at a later occasion. If you are downloading all of the message when reading it (mostly, unless using a web interface), you could filter away large attachments (keep an unfiltered copy in a separate folder for later viewing). There is software to convert most documents to plain text, you might be able to use them to convert instead of delete the attachments in your filtered version. Configure your best friends' e-mail software such that they do not send HTML in addition to the plaintext messages.\n\nIf you use a web server for reading mail, you might want to limit the bells and whistles of the web interface.

A proxy is needed to filter unwanted content of the file to be downloaded, such as inline junk. To use a proxy is easily configured in the browser, but to choose and configure a proxy to your needs is more work.\n\nThe extreme lighweight solution is to use text based access (SSH) to a computer with good connections (at home or wherever) running the e-mail and browser programs (e.g. alpine and elinks). This was the standard way to have Internet access in the old days of 14.4 kb\/s, and still works at least for e-mail (some configuring may be necessary if you have friends writing their e-mail with office suites – and images have to be explicitly downloaded before view).\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usabletopic"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["PartOfTopic"],["Communication"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Internet access"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["ja:海外でインターネットを使う"]]}]
