[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Welcome banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Inuktitut"]}," is the name for the varieties of Inuit spoken in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Canada"]]},". It is an Eskimo-Aleut language that known for being a language with lots of very long agglutinative words, owing to the fact that there are a very large number of infixes (parts of speech which modify the meaning of a word), but it does not have the same irregularities as Indo-European languages. There is also a rumour that the language has hundreds of different words for snow, in reality there are only four (these four are: spread-out snow - ",{"type":"'''","value":["aput"]},", snow like salt - ",{"type":"'''","value":["pokaktok"]},", newly-drifted snow - ",{"type":"'''","value":["akelrorak"]}," and soft snow - ",{"type":"'''","value":["mauyaôlertok"]},"). There are a few (not hundreds) of words ",{"type":"''","value":["relating"]}," to snow eg. snow block (auverk), igloo (iglu), snow knife (panar), snow on clothes, boots etc. (ayak).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Pronunciation Guide"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Vowels"]},"\n\n; A a : Like \"a\" in \"cat\".\n; E e : Like \"e\" in \"bet\".\n; I i : Like \"ee\" in \"feet\".\n; O o : Like \"o\" in \"hot\".\n; U u : Like \"u\" in \"put\".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Consonants"]},"\n\n; D d : Like \"d\" in \"dad\".\n; G g : Like \"g\" in \"get\".\n; J j : Like \"y\" in \"yet\".\n; K k : Like \"k\" in \"oak\".\n; L l : Like \"l\" in \"let\".\n; M m : Like \"m\" in \"man\".\n; N n : Like \"n\" in \"no\".\n; P p : Like \"p\" in \"pan\".\n; Q q : Like \"c\" in \"car\" but deeper in the throat.\n; R r : Like \"r\" in \"road\".\n; S s : Like \"sh\" in \"shot\".\n; T t : Like \"t\" in \"stop\".\n; W w : Like \"w\" in \"wet\".\n; Y y : Like \"y\" in \"yet\".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Common diphthongs"]},"\n\n; kr : Like \"k\" in \"king\" but pronounced deep in the throat.
