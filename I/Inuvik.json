It is one of the last places on earth that can feel very much untouched by humans, and the sense of being top of the world is impossible to avoid.\n\nThe local people are very friendly, and quite willing to show those curious enough to ask how they still, in the 21st century live off the land; in the some of the harshest conditions on the planet.\n\nOne can explore for thousands of miles in any direction, by snow mobile, boat of atv. Just be sure to have a guide go with you who is familiar with the land, as Inuvik is a very isolated town,and you want to make sure you get back. Also ensure you have sufficient supplies for your adventure, as there is nothing outside of the town to provide you with petrol, food (apart from hunting), or a warm dry bed.\n\nOr stay in town. The local people are trying very hard to preserve their culture, and tourists showing a genuine interest will help support their goals. From soap stone carvings, to stunning beadwork, even watercolour paintings by local artists will dazzle the senses and be sure to provide you with a unique experience.\n\nThe best time to get a sense of what the town can offer is during the Great Northern Arts festival, held each year in Inuvik. It's a summer occasion, so you will experience the 24 hours of sunshine as well as see artists who come from across the north, as far way as Newfoundland, Nunavut, the Yukon, Alaska and Northwest Territories. Everyone one with the northern spirit is welcome to have bannock and caribou stew and see the best of the best in Arctic art. Some artists are even creating their pieces on site, so you can see first hand how to turn a stone into a magnificent figure of polar bears, walrus or Inuit faces.\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Midnight Sun Recreation Complex"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Great swimming pool: lanes, \"lazy river,\" large water slide, volleyball net and basketball net.
