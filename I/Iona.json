This was the home of Celtic Christianity for six hundred years until King David suppressed Celtic Christianity in the twelfth century.  Iona remained a major pilgrimage site until the reformation when the island was sacked and the community scattered.  In the early twentieth century, the abbey was rebuilt and a new monastic community has begun here, providing much of the tourism for the island.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Ferry at Iona, Scotland, Sept. 2010 - Flickr - PhillipC.jpg"],["thumb"],["Ferry at the slipway"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["A ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.calmac.co.uk Caledonian Macbrayne"]}," ferry service operates from the town of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fionnphort"]]},", on the isle of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mull"]]},", and operates on an approximately hourly frequency between 7.30am and 6.30pm.
