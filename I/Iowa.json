True to form in the Midwest, settlers tended to gravitate toward rivers and established their communities there.  Today, many of the State's major cities are based on rivers including Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, Iowa City, Davenport, Dubuque, Sioux City and Council Bluffs.  For many years, agriculture was the primary industry of the state but recently, the State's population has tended to urbanize resulting in a diverse mixture of industries.  Agriculture, though significantly diminished as the economic driver of the state, is still a major economic component.\n\nThough Iowa has long been considered a rural state, it has a surprisingly rich cultural scene.  The University of Iowa in Iowa City is home to a number of major programs including the Iowa Writers Workshop, a program that has trained a number of America's great modern writers.  Iowa State University in Ames is also a major driver of culture in the central part of the State.

If you want to see the true face of the state, get off the interstate, ignore the fast-food signs, and find one of the small towns that make the Midwest so charming.  State maps are available free of charge at state \"Welcome Centers\" and rest areas.
