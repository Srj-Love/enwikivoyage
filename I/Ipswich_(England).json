[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"],["pgname=Ipswich"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Ipswich"]}," is the county town of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Suffolk"]]},". Mostly recognised for its football club, it has recently had new developments such as the Waterfront entertainment district, the University Campus Suffolk and new shopping developments are under construction.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nIpswich was one of the most prosperous cities in the UK since Saxon times. During its heyday it was a major trading port, being located on the estuary of the Orwell River on the East Coast. Ipswich fell into rapid decline after the opening of the new ports at Felixstowe and Harwich and stayed that way until the 1970s when much of London's financial services industry used Ipswich as a hub for their secondary offices with names such as Royal Bank of Scotland, Willis Group (pka Willis Faber & Dumas), Norwich Union and AXA opening shiny new skyscrapers in a new CBD development just north of the river. Most recently, the brand new University Campus Suffolk brought on rapid development along the waterfront area with lots of trendy new bars, restaurants and apartments lining the east bank of the river.\n\nAnyone expecting a typical, small provincial town will get a little culture shock when stepping out of the train station as 1960s tower blocks, Saxon half-timber cottages, Victorian townhouses and shiny new high-rise developments sit side-by-side.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By Air"]},"\nIpswich has good connections to both London Stansted and Norwich International airports.\nFrom Stansted, there is an express bus service (X5) which runs between Ipswich Old Cattle Market Bus Station and Stansted Airport Coach Station every 2 hours, 24 hours a day; taking approx. 90 minutes. Expect to pay around GBP75 for a prebooked minicab and over GBP100 for a metered taxi.\n\nNorwich Airport can be reached in approx. 1-1.5 hours. From the airport, take a local bus or a taxi to Norwich Railway Station and from there it's about 40 minutes by train to Ipswich. A taxi will be about GBP50-60.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By Train"]},"\nIpswich Station is located on the West Bank of the Orwell River on the intersection between Princes St, Burrell Rd and Ranelagh Rd, about 1 mile from the town centre. There are frequent services (every 20 minutes) to London Liverpool Street (1hr10mins journey time), Norwich (every 30 mins - 40min journey time), Cambridge (every hour - 1hr20min journey time), as well as services every two hours to Lowestoft and Peterborough, and an hourly service to Felixstowe. Tickets must be purchased from the vending machines (credit cards accepted) or at the ticket office in the entrance hall of the station. Taxis and local buses depart from the station's forecourt.\n\nThere is also a smaller station called Derby Rd. Ipswich, located on Derby Rd in the eastern suburb of Rose Hill. It is unstaffed and has an hourly service between Ipswich and Felixstowe. It's not recommended to take a train from here at night as there are no staff and very little lighting or CCTV.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By Bus and Coach"]},"\nOld Cattle Market bus station on Falcon Street serves all regional and long-distance bus services. Frequent regional buses run to Stowmarket, Sudbury, Woodbridge, Felixstowe, Colchester, Framlingham etc., while National Express services run to London (3 times per day), Liverpool (1 per day), and Stansted Airport (every 2 hours). Rural bus and minibus services run to surrounding villages, although some are very infrequent. There is no ticket office at the station, so tickets should be bought on board (change is usually available but drivers will be reluctant to change large bills), except for National Express services, which must be prebooked by phone or over the internet. Electronic signboards display the next 20 or so departures and which stand they will depart from. Schedules are displayed at each departure gate.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By Car"]},"\nIpswich is conveniently located on the intersections of the A12 (London - Great Yarmouth) and A14 (Felixstowe - Birmingham) highways with several exits along both routes. Driving into the city can be slow as traffic congestion is heavy. Also, a very confusing one-way system runs around the edge of the city centre, feeding drivers into the rabbit-warren of small streets. Maps and sat-navs are a bit useless once you're past the inner ring-road so allow plenty of time. Parking is very limited and expensive (in an underground or multi-storey city centre car park expect to pay about GBP9.00 for 3 hours) although some parking areas close to the inner ring-road will charge around GBP2.50 for one day, although they are not as secure. Alternatively, Park & Ride bus services run from 3 parking sites on the edge of the city close to the A14, costing GBP2.80 per day including free bus travel to the city centre. Look out for the blue Park & Ride signs (displaying a letter 'P' alongside a bus) when approaching Ipswich on the highway.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By Bus"]},"\nLocal urban bus services are provided by Ipswich Buses and First Eastern Counties and radiate from the Tower Ramparts Bus Station. The green and white Ipswich buses cover most urban routes and link to surrounding suburbs and retail parks. Most services run every 10–20 minutes during the day time and every 30–60 minutes in the early morning and late evening - most services start around 5:30am and finish around 11:00pm. There's a flat fare of GBP1.80 which is paid into the farebox next to the driver - if you don't have exact change you'll be issued with a voucher that can be used as part-payment on your next journey or can be refunded at the Ipswich Buses customer service office at Tower Ramparts bus station. Day passes, weekly and monthly tickets are available, as well as a rechargeable smart-card for regular travellers. First Eastern Counties services are less frequent except for #66 which runs every 15 minutes between Bourne Bridge and Martlesham and runs 24 hours a day. Fares on First buses are charged by distance and return tickets are available - change is also given but drivers are reluctant to change anything bigger than a GBP5.00 note. Tickets are not interchangeable between operators.\n\nA useful service for tourists is the #38 which loops the town centre and is free of charge - useful for getting to know your way around. An open-top sightseeing bus runs a circuit of nearby tourist attractions during the summer months.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By car"]},"\nDriving around Ipswich is not recommended - traffic is often heavy, the rabbit-warren of one-way streets is confusing and parking can be expensive. However, a car is more useful if you're staying in the suburbs or plan on travelling to some more remote attractions away from the town.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By taxi"]},"\nTaxis in Ipswich are cheap by British standards. Metered taxis can be found at taxi-stands outside the train station, the Old Cattle Market bus station and on a side-street beside Debenhams just off Crown Street - hailing a taxi in the street is not recommended as most taxi drivers will wait in a taxi rank rather than cruise for passengers. Phone-booked minicabs are cheaper and will take you to more inaccessible locations, but can be hard to book late on Friday and Saturday nights. Note that if you want to travel by taxi to a nearby town such as Felixstowe or Stowmarket, local minicabs in those towns will usually be cheaper than those in Ipswich.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["On Foot"]},"\nIpswich town centre is very compact and much of the town-centre is pedestrianised so walking is often the fastest and most pleasant way of getting around. However, walking at night is not so fun - walking beyond the town centre usually involves passing some unpleasant areas and walking through the public underpasses that cross the 'inner ring' or along by the river can sometimes be unsafe - take a taxi instead.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By bicycle"]},"\nIpswich Borough Council has gone to great lengths in recent years to make the town more cycle-friendly, and most major routes into the town centre have cycle or bus lanes, although they are often ignored by motorists, many of whom are not happy with sharing the road with cyclists, so it helps to have a good level of confidence in urban cycling. Alternatively, there are several signposted cycle routes taking in quiet residential streets, traffic free trails through the towns many parks and contraflow cycle lanes that allow cyclists to travel in both directions on a one way street. National Cycle Network routes 1 and 51 pass though Ipswich, and the borough council produces a free cycle map.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Christchurch Mansion and Park"]},"."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["The ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ancient House on Buttermarket"]},".

Other independent stores for men include Jonty's(Tacket Street) and the department store Coes on Norwich Road.\n\nA long pedestrianized street (Northgate Street, Tavern Street, Carr Street) runs right across the town centre and is lined with big-name stores such as H and M, Gap, Debenhams, Boots, Marks & Spencer etc. A few smaller pedestrian streets house some smaller retailers and is the best place to find small, independent retailers. There are 2 main indoor shopping malls (Buttermarket Centre and Tower Ramparts Shopping Centre) although neither are anything special, this is where you can find Topshop, Topman, laura Ashley and TK Maxx.\n\nThe south-eastern part of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Norwich Road"]}," is a good place to see Ipswich's vibrant ethnic community and the street is lined with shops and restaurants selling food, snacks and local products from the Middle East, Eastern Europe, India and elsewhere.\n\nMany locals now prefer shopping in out-of-town retail parks and superstores. Copdock Interchange retail park close to the intersection between the A12 and A14 highways in the southwest of Ipswich is one of the largest with a 24-hour Tesco Extra superstore, Toys R Us, PC World, Currys (electronics and appliances) and several fast-food chains including Burger King, McDonalds and Pizza Hut (take Bus 13 from Tower Ramparts and get off at the last stop - by car it's close to the A12\/A14 Copdock Interchange and at the end of the A1214 London Road from Ipswich town centre - free parking). Anglia Retail Park in the northwest of Ipswich close to the A14 highway is also popular and has an Asda superstore, B&Q home-improvement and the usual furniture and appliance stores, plus a McDonalds and a KFC (Bus 8 from Tower Ramparts - get off at the last stop - by car it's close to the Ipswich\/Bury Road exit of the A14, at the top end of Norwich Road from the town centre).\n\nThe main supermarket serving the town centre is Sainsbury on Upper Brook Street. There is a larger Sainsbury on Hadleigh Road close to the train station, and there's a small branch of Somerfield on Carr Street in the town centre. Most other supermarkets are located out of town in large retail parks - the two largest are listed above. Convenience stores such as Martins, Co-op, Spar, Tesco Express and Premier can be found everywhere - most are open from 6AM-11PM, although many petrol station convenience stores are 24-hour.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nSt Nicholas Street in Ipswich has several restaurants. You can eat Greek, Italian, French, Thai, Chinese, Indian and modern British cuisine. The best of these are Keo's and The Galley for British food, The Ghandi and Zaika for Indian Food, Trongs for Chinese, and Kwan Thai for Thai.\n\nAnother good area to eat in is the waterfront with an abundance of local choices, lots of good British cuisine and also a French restaurant. The best by far along here is The Salthouse Harbour Hotel which is rated very highly. Others worth a try are The Bistro on the Quay, Il Punto, The Waterfront, and Quayside.\n\nAway from the two main areas are plenty more options. The Arboretum, located near the Ipswich museum is fast becoming a town favourite with rave reviews. Award winning restaurant Aqua Eight serves unrivalled Chinese and south east Asian food.

Be careful of parking your car in quiet residential streets at night, or leaving your car in a privately run 'budget car park' such as the one at the waterfront, as car break-ins and car-thefts are common - use a town-centre car park operated by Ipswich Borough Council or NCP instead.\n\nThere's a strong rivalry between Ipswich Town FC and Norwich City FC - on match days avoid wearing football colours or saying things that may provoke a football-related confrontation.
