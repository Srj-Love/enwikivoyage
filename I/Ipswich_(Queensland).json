[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Australia-oceania default banner.jpg"],["pgname=Ipswich"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Ipswich"]}," is a city in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South East Queensland"]]},", 44 km west of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brisbane"]]},". When the Moreton Bay convict settlement was established by Britain, Ipswich was about as far as craft could venture up the Brisbane and Bremer Rivers, and as coal was found here, there was very early Europeon settlement. Because of the coal mines, Ipswich was seen as primarily an industrial centre, however these days Ipswich is more seen as a satellite of Brisbane. There are still the railway industries, Swanbank power station and RAAF Amberley, but the city has recently expanded substantially because of its part in the massive expansion of South East Queensland as a very desirable place to live. For the visitor on the way to Sydney on the Cunningham Highway or Toowoomba on the Warrego Highway, the by-pass is usually taken, however the inquiring visitor will find much of interest in this city of 155,000. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nIpswich can be reached from Brisbane via the Caboolture via Brisbane to Ipswich line.
