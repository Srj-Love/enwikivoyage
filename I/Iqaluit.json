Rogers Wireless has an exclusive roaming agreement with Ice Wireless, so Rogers customers can use the network for a fee, but it is voice-only (data roaming is not available).\n\nThe other wireless option is Bell, which operates a CDMA-only network (no GSM). Bell has announced plans to upgrade their network in Iqaluit to 4G by late 2014.  \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Internet"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Iqaluit Centennial Library"],["address=220 Sinaa Street"],["phone=+1 867-979-5400"],["hours=1–6pm Mon and Wed, 3–8pm Tue and Thu, 3–6pm Fri, 1–4pm Sat–Sun"],["content=A public library located in the same building as the visitor centre.
