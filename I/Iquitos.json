This is not to be confused with the Department Amazonas where Chachapoyas is located. Iquitos is the capital of the vast Department of Loreto, which covers most of the northern Amazon region of Peru.\n\nFor travelers, Iquitos offers a vast selection of activities not found elsewhere in Peru, such as Amazon boat rides and great wildlife viewing.  One way to see Peru is to visit the 3 areas - Coastal, Andes, and Amazon -- and Iquitos is the best way to see the Amazon.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nIquitos is hot and humid (90 percent), year round. The population is very diverse: there were many periods of big wealth in Iquitos (mainly two with rubber and oil) that brought people from around the world and made it the most important fluvial port in the Peruvian Amazon. The city still has a lot of houses which were built during that age. 'Iquiteños' (or 'Iquitinos') are usually very friendly and like to party.\n\nAs a city not accessible by road, motorcycles and motocarros dominate unlike anywhere else.  Imagine if an American style biker-gang had taken over a city.  This makes the city a bit more manic and loud.  Other results include remarkably fluid (if chaotic) traffic, a preponderance of motorcycle ads and repair shops, and a sub-industry of people who agree to guard your motorcycle while you shop (even placing cardboard on the seat to keep it cooler during the day).\n\nGeographic and Climatic Data for Iquitos Peru\n\nThis data for Iquitos Peru is from the NASA Langley Atmospheric Science Data Research Center.\n\nLatitude: Minus 3.75 degrees south of the equator.\n\nThe elevation above sea level is approximately 106 meters or 351 feet.\n\nThe Coordinated Universal Time of Peru is UTC-5, the same as Florida and New York, Eastern Standard Time.  Remember that Peru doesn't observe daylight savings time, so Iquitos will be the same time as Central Standard Time for about half of the year.\n\nThe time difference between the longest day and the shortest day is only 18 minutes.\n\nThe temperature measured by °F averaged from 22 years of data per month:\n\n(Jan. 82.09) (Feb. 81.86) (Mar. 82.60) (Apr. 82.06) (May 82.42) (June 82.20)\n\n(July 82.04) (Aug 83.55) (Sept. 85.78) (Oct. 86.59) (Nov. 84.88) (Dec. 82.87)\n\nThe average rainfall at the Iquitos Port is 103 inches per year. March and April have slightly more rain on a 10 year average, and July and August have slightly less than average, but contrary to popular belief there is very little difference in month to month precipitation in Iquitos. The water level of the river fluctuates by as much as 40 feet per year, triggered by rainfall and snow melt on the east slopes of the Andes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nIquitos is widely considered the largest continental city unreachable by road.  That leaves planes and boats as the primary means of entrance and egress for both people and supplies.\n\nDo not expect to see a city with all the trappings of the western world. This city is very basic as it has no road connection with the rest of the world. Vehicles are old and most vehicles on the meager roads are \"motor taxis\" or three wheeler motorbikes which can carry three at a pinch. The people are friendly once you get past the taxi drivers at the airport\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nThere are numerous flights to Iquitos from the capital ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lima"]]},".

Flights are from $55 USD to $200 USD, depending the season and promotions. Is suggested to check prices in all the airlines in advance to get cheap tickets.\n\nWhen arriving at the airport, consider stopping at the official iPeru, Tourist Information and Assistance Office of the Peruvian Tourist Board (PromPerú) before exiting the terminal.  You can get a free map and brochure (without ads!), a list of tour providers, recommendations about what to see and do and safety recommendations. They may help you in case of problems and complaints in all over Peru.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\nIquitos can be reached by boat from any navigable port on the Amazon River.

Therefore, you can choose the speedboats from Tuesday to Sunday, the trip takes 9 - 10 hours (USD 65.00).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe most common way to move around town is by ",{"type":"'''","value":["motocarro"]},", a motorcycle with a small, rickshaw-like passenger cabin in the back. Taxis are available too, but the heat and availability of the moto-taxis makes it advisable to take a motocarro. Sometimes the 1.5\/2 soles ride is worth the cost just for the breeze.  Most places you will want to go within the city cost about 1.5 soles, but places further away (for example, from the airport to Plaza de Armas) usually costs about 3 soles or more.  The drivers often make their money by kickbacks from the hotels they take you to.\n\nIt's hard to understate how available and prevalent the motocarros are in the city.  Near the city center, it's common for 2 or 3 empty motocarros to pass you on the street in any given minute.  The driver will make eye contact with you, hoping that you are interested in a ride.  Not all motocarros are identical in the quality of their ride; older ones will tend to transfer the vibration of the motorcycle to the passenger cabin, while newer and better maintained ones won't.  When taking a motocarro, it can be comfortable on longer rides to hail a newer-looking one.\n\nIf you're economically minded, it can be fun to learn about the economics of motocarros.  As of May 2010, it is typical for the drivers to rent their taxis for S\/.10.00 Soles\/hour or S\/.25 - 30 Soles\/day.\n\nMany motocarristas (those who drive the motocarros) make excellent city guides.  Motocarristas are extremely friendly and outgoing, in fact, they are too outgoing and even aggressive in their pursuit to gain a passenger.  So tourists can enjoy some peace in Iquitos, do not take a ride from a taxi driver who asks you for a ride when you are sitting and eating.\n\nWhen you exit the airport you will be approached very aggressively by the taxi drivers (this is a more acceptable place for taxi driver aggression.)  The drive from the airport to the city center is quite a distance, relative to the size of the Iquitos area, and prices are fixed at 8 soles, although it may be possible to negotiate as low as 6 soles.  Anyone offering a lower price will likely try to take you to a hotel or hostel that pays them; if you already have a hotel in mind, stay firm and they will take you there.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThe riverfront is just one block from the Plaza de Armas.  In the low water season it will retreat and thus not be terribly visible.  The waterfront walk also seems to be the place where local high schoolers go to canoodle, so if you stroll it be prepared to see lots of this. There is a somewhat big crafts market right below the walk, called Anaconda Center.\n\nThe Plaza de Armas is a mix of mostly modern and rubber boom styles. Cities like Iquitos turned into one long party during that age, where no expense was spared, nor eccentricity nor luxury lacking. As part of the legacy of this rubber boom age of abundance, Iquitos still bears traces of the extravagant taste of the rubber barons: mosaic tiles in Italian-style palaces, the bustling riverside walkway or the Iron House, a famous residence designed by Gustave Eiffel that was built from metal sheets. It was carried by hundreds of men through the jungle. There are a few street performers, a fountain, some statues, and one Catholic church. It is quite busy on a Saturday evening.\n\nToday, in the city of Iquitos, the modest local homes -not without a certain kitsch charm- exist alongside French mansions, today largely used as public offices. When rubber seeds were smuggled out of the country, the rubber industry moved to Malaysia, signifying the end of the rubber barons. The memory of this past filled with abundance, however, lives on in the eccentric buildings which testify to an exuberant and wild era.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Casa de Fierro"],["alt=The Iron House"],["url="],["email="],["address=On the corner of Próspero and Putumayo"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Main Square"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}," It houses crafts shops and a restaurant."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Ex Hotel Palace"],["alt=Former Hotel Palace"],["url="],["email="],["address=On the corner of Putumayo and Tarapacá"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=One block from Plaza de Armas"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}," overlooking the Itaya River."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Mercado Artesanal de San Juan"],["alt=San Juan handicraft market"],["url="],["email="],["address=Km. 4.5 Av.
