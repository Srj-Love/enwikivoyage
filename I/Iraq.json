A part of the Ottoman Empire from 1534, the Treaty of Sèvres brought the area under British control in 1918. Iraq gained independence in 1932. On 14 July 1958, the long-time Hashamite monarchy was overthrown in a coup led by Abdul Kassem that paved way to radical political reforms, including the legalisation of political parties such as the Ba'ath and the Communist Party, both key players in the coup (also called the 14 July Revolution). Following the Revolution, the Soviet Union gradually became its main arms and commercial supplier.\n\nIn February 1963, Kassem was overthrown and killed in a second coup that brought the Ba'ath Party into power. Internal divisions would follow for the next five years, until another coup on 17 July 1968 led by Ahmad Hassan al-Bakr (with Communist support) stabilised the party. Relations between the Communists and the Ba'athists ranged from mutual cooperation to violent mistrust, culminating in the purge of Communists from the army and the government by 1978, causing a temporary rift with the Soviet Union. On 16 July 1979, Bakr resigned and was succeeded by right-hand man Saddam Hussein, who carefully purged his enemies and became a dictator almost overnight.\n\nThe next twenty-five years took a grinding toll on the country. A long war with neighboring Iran in the 1980s cost hundreds of thousands of lives and billions of dollars. The invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and subsequent Gulf War caused further casualties, followed by civil war inside the country and a decade of international sanctions.\n\nIraq was invaded in 2003 by a U.S\/UK-led coalition of forces, who removed Saddam Hussein from power.

The north of the country is mostly composed of mountains; the highest point being at 3,611 m (11,847 ft) point, unnamed on the map opposite, but known locally as Cheekah Dar (black tent).

",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.flygryphon.com\/ Gryphon"]}," offers flights between the military side of BIAP and Kuwait City.\n\nAdditional Services to the city of Van, Turkey are offered by Turkish airlines from most western cities via Istanbul, from here a taxi will take you to the border for the equivalent of USD35-200 depending on your bargaining skills (Turkish drivers will only usually accept Lira, euros or pounds sterling)\n\nFor those working for Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) in Iraq, there are two charter airlines operating into BIAP.  Skylink and AirServ operate frequent flights.  Travel on either of these services requires sponsorship by your NGO to get you onto an approved traveller list maintained by each.  Schedules and services can be irregular, and change frequently.\n\nThe airport is under control of the Iraqi government.  Take-offs and landings at BIAP are controlled by the Iraqi Ministry of Transportation.  Several critical pieces of Air Traffic Control gear have not been turned on, and the result of this is that BIAP can only accommodate Visual Flight Rule (VFR) landings, not instrument landings.  Because of this, the frequent sandstorms that hit the area can obscure visibility and cause flights to be turned away. It is not unusual for commercial flights to make it all the way to BIAP, and then turn around and return to their origin due to limited visibility on the runway. To protect against the extreme danger of ground-based attacks, incoming civilian flights descend from cruising altitudes in a tight spiral within protected BIAP airspace.\n\nWhen departing at BIAP, be prepared for long, disorderly, and excessively slow lines wherever you go.  If you are not working in Iraq on a government contract, your entrance to the airport grounds about three or four miles from the airport terminal will require you and your vehicle to wait in line to be searched. These security checkpoints can take from two to three hours to process through. The best strategy is to find accommodations somewhere within the BIAP area of control on the day prior to your flight so that you aren't subjected to the long wait and end up missing your flight.  \n\nAll airlines operating services at BIAP have a 100% bag matching policy.  All bags, whether carry-ons or checked luggage, are lined up on the tarmac next to the aircraft. Each individual passenger must physically touch and claim their bags before a baggage handler and security personnel will match it and then load it into the hold. Any bags left on the tarmac after the boarding process is complete are not loaded and are taken away from the terminal area to a secure facility for disposal.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nAfter twenty years of non-service, a once-weekly passenger train had been put in service between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gaziantep"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southeastern Anatolia"],["southeastern Turkey"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mosul"]]},", crossing a short strip of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Syria"]]},"n territory.

It is possible to take a previously arranged taxi, the average cost of this taxi ride is $150 American dollars and most of the drivers only speak Kurdish or Arabic. You will often switch taxis in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Silopi"]]}," about five minutes from the Iraqi border, or you will change cars about 70km from the border and continue on from there. The taxi driver will then take care of all your paperwork at the border. This involves your driver running from building to building getting paperwork stamped and approved.  You must have a photocopy of your passport for the Turkish section of the border, which they require that you leave with them (the photocopy, not your passport).\n\nA much less expensive option is to take a bus from Diyarbakir directly to Silopi. This won't cost more than about 20 YTL. From the Silopi otogar (bus station), it's easy to get a taxi to Zakho. A good taxi driver can handle all of the photocopying and paperwork for the Turkish side. \n\nAt this point you will finish driving across the border crossing into Iraq. Your taxi driver will then take you to the Iraqi immigration and customs section.  All persons and vehicles entering Iraq must be searched for contraband by the customs officers, and their vehicles are registered and pay some sort of stamp tax, however, occasionally, searches are not conducted. Without this stamp tax, it is illegal for a non-Iraqi vehicle to purchase gas at any of the state-run gas stations all over the country.  After paying any import duties to customs and receiving the vehicle stamp, the immigration officers will check your passport and stamp it if you have a visa.  Additionally, at some land border crossings, your fingerprint and\/or photo will be taken.  As of July 2008, there was no visa fee at this border crossing.\n\nAt this point, you will be at the border taxi stand, a few kilometers outside of the city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zakho"]]},", and may need to hire another taxi to get to Zakho's city center (5,000-10,000 Dinars).

Tragically, this mosque is badly damaged, suffering explosions in sectarian violence in 2006, destroying the dome, minarets, and clock tower. Lastly, Al-Kadhimiya Mosque in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kadhimiya"]]}," is revered, as it is the burial place of the seventh and ninth Imams, Musa al-Kadhim and Muhammad at-Taqi. Also buried within this mosque are the famous historical scholars, Shaykh Mufid and Shaykh Nasir ad-Din Tusi.

Given the warfare, external and internal, and government atrocities committed against its own people over the past 40 years, one can only expect that the future will see widespread construction of memorials to those who suffered. But such developments may have to wait until the nation's turbulent present settles down. In the meantime, it is possible (albeit often dangerous) to visit the cities and sites of battles that have become household names throughout the world in the most recent conflict.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\nIraqi dinar is the official currency, however you will also be able to spend Euros (€) and US Dollars ($) almost everywhere. Be aware that most people do not like to make change for large bills.  Also note that any defects in the bills (creases, ink stamps from banks, tears, etc.) will raise suspicion that you are a counterfeiter.  Don't bring old bills with you, either.  Carry mostly small bills in the form of Iraqi dinars for daily spending cash.  Since the introduction of the new Iraqi dinar, its widespread acceptance and confidence has reduced the prominence of the USD, and many shopkeepers are now refusing to accept them.  However, most people will still pay large hotel bills or rent payments using USD or EUR due to the sheer volume of notes required to pay with dinars.  The conversion rate fluctuates from day to day and from town to town, but is around 1175 dinar to US$1. Inflation used to be relative high (65% a year since 2003) but in recent years it is much lower than before (11% in 2008), which makes the Iraqi dinar becomes an attractive target for investors, unlike the Vietnamese dong.\n\nLearn the security features of the new dinar and dollar notes; the former Iraqi government was known to be making passable $20, $10, and $5 U.S. notes, and these counterfeiters are apparently still in business.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=monir"],["alt=mardini"],["url="],["email="],["address=26023"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=3134432776"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=hummus"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"<","value":["b",["Masgouf"]]},"- Considered as the national dish of Iraq.

Sleeping outside and near flowing water is the most comfortable setting one can find outside of air conditioning.\n\nIn Iraqi Kurdistan, there are plenty of hotels and although they are hard to find in any travel guide, anyone on the street will direct you to a nearby place. There's no shortage in Zakho, Dohuk or Arbil. Rates run about 15 USD to 25 USD per night for a single room with bathroom.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Work"]},"\n\nWork in Iraq pays very well.  Typical foreign contractors can make up to $100k per year for security and admin work.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nAfter the war was declared officially over on December 2011, the political situation is very unstable. In May 2013, a series of deadly bombings and shootings happened. In December 2013, clashes in Anbar occurred. In January 2014, the control of Fallujah is divided between the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and Sunni anti-government tribal militias.\n\nIraq is beset with numerous problems that make travelling risky and difficult. The security situation is perilous in just about any area of the country, and continues to deteriorate under continuing terrorist attacks. Resistance to continuing military occupation, U.S. and UK forces, and Iraqi military, police or anyone associated with the Iraqi government, as well as increasing factional and sectarian conflict make street warfare, bombings, and other acts of armed violence daily occurrences.\n\nThe central third of the country is the most volatile; the southern ports are ",{"type":"''","value":["less"]}," dangerous, but only relatively so. However, northern Iraq, or Kurdistan is safe and has suffered from very little violence since 2003. Major cities, including Baghdad, are fertile grounds for political upheavals, kidnappings, and other underground activity, so tread lightly. The Kurdish peshmerga (military) is over 100,000 strong and every road, town, city and even village has checkpoints going in and out. All non-Kurds are searched thoroughly and occasionally followed by the internal secret police. However fear not, this is why there is almost no chance of terrorism in the North. The police are friendly and everyone is happy to meet foreigners, especially Americans.\n\nTraveling alone makes you an easy kidnapping target, and is best avoided – if possible travel with a translator\/guard. There are comprehensive private and state security services available for your personal protection - you are strongly advised to use the available options for your own safety. If employed in Iraq, consult your employer on how to handle your personal safety. Independent contractors will usually have security provided by their clients, if no security is provided you should seriously consider not traveling to Iraq, if you must go you should hire armed security and get proper training in appropriate protective gear, survival, and weapons.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\n\nIt is not safe for short term visitors to drink the water anywhere in Iraq. It is best to always drink bottled water, preferably made by a Western or Jordanian company.  It will usually be sold at vendors and large stores, and will be easy to find.  Most Iraqi water companies pump their water directly from the Tigris or Euphrates rivers, treat it with ozone, and then filter it into bottles.  The taste is often not very good, and those with sensitive systems should not drink it.  Many street vendors will offer drinks such as water with a lemon twist, which should be presumed unsafe for foreign visitors.\n\nThose with experience in Iraq should use their discretion and past experience when purchasing drinks.\n\nDrinking the local tea (chai) can be safe for some people since it is brought to a boil before serving, but when in doubt, insist that bottled water be used.  Many kinds of water-borne disease, pollution, and infectious agents are not affected by boiling of water, and are still present in the water after boiling.\n\nAs a walk past an Iraqi butcher shop will demonstrate, food preparation standards are not the same as in Western countries, and consumption of local food can make a visitor ill.  Try to bring your own.  As tap water is generally not potable, you should especially avoid uncooked foods.\n\nShould you find your body in the uncomfortable position of rejecting food and water due to something you shouldn't have drunk, immediately find someone who speaks Arabic and send them to a local pharmacist and request a product known locally as \"InterStop\" (similar to co-phenotrope\/Lomotil).  This works better than any well-known western brands.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Respect"]},"\n\nNever show the soles of your feet to others. This may be considered very disrespectful by most Iraqis, unless you are in the company of friends.
