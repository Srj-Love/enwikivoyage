With a minimal level of terrorist activity and massive economic development, Kurdistan is fast becoming a \"gateway to Iraq\" with high levels of foreign investment and development of infrastructure and tourism.\n\nBe careful when discussing nationalist issues which many Kurds feel strongly about. Also read up on the Al-Anfal campaign and chemical attack on the Kurds by Saddam Hussein to exterminate droves of Kurds in the late 80’s, an event which has coloured the last few decades of Kurdish history. There are several powerful reminders of it, such as the Amna Suraka prison in Suleymaniyah.\n\nAnd be careful about calling a Kurd Iraqi because they don't count themselves as Iraqi: even though they are Iraqi citizens by record, they say Kurds are from Kurdistan - the land of the Kurds - and not Iraq, and recently the president of Kurdistan was claiming to announce the Kurdish State, which is a serious debate in the region. Many Kurds also consider it unjust that there is no independent Kurdistan.\n\nIn Iraq there are considerable differences between the Kurds and Arabs. Languages, culture and life styles all differ from Kurdish to Arab regions. The Kurdish society consists of variety of religions and beliefs (such as Muslims, Christians, Jewish, Yazidis, Kakayis, Zoroastrians, Yarsanis, Hawaris, Ahli Haqs, etc.) all of which normally coexist peacefully.\n\nIn general, Kurdish people are very friendly and hospitable, you can make friends with anybody and start talking to anyone on the street, so be open to new experiences.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Orientation"]},"\n\nIraqi Kurdistan refers to the three northern Iraqi Provinces, which are autonomous of the central Iraqi government and ruled by the KRG. These provinces achieved de facto independence after an uprising in 1991 and their autonomy has now been enshrined into the Iraqi federal constitution. The three Kurdish Provinces are Duhok, Erbil, and Sulaymaniya. The KRG has applied for creating a fourth region around the city of Halabja.\nAlthough the city Kirkuk is largely inhabited and controlled by Kurdish armed forces, ",{"type":"''","value":["the Peshmenga"]},", it is still not under official administration of the KRG. Kirkuk and parts of the Ninaveh and Diyala provinces are disputed. The Kurds claim that these places are originally Kurdish, but were subjected to harsh Arabisation by the ousted Ba'ath Party. The Kurds want these areas returned to Kurdish autonomy. Something that has largely been realised during the ISIL rebellion in June 2014 after which the Kurdish armed forced took full control over the areas. \n",{"type":"{{","value":[["warningbox"],["It is not safe to travel in these disputed areas!"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\n\nThe major cities controlled by the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) are:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Choman"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Duhok"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Erbil"]]}," (Hawler) — the capital city of Kurdistan"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Halabja"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Kirkuk"]]}," (not safe)"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Koye"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Lalish"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Rawanduz"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Raniya"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Shaqlawa"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Sulaymaniyah"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Zakho"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Al-Kosh"]]}," – a tranquil, 2500 years old Christian village."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Amedi"]]}," – a 4000 year old town perched on the peak of a mountain, rumoured home of Biblical Magi, and confirmed home to Assyrian ruins."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Chemi Rezan"]]}," - the famous caves in which the earliest human ceremonial burial site."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Dukan Lake"]]}," - a large man-made lake lying at an altitude of 900m.

This involves many forms to fill out, around $30 USD in fees as well as a compulsory blood test to check for Hep C and HIV. Be prepared to wait for around 2-3 hours throughout this whole process.\nMost other nationalities must produce a valid \"Iraq - Kurdistan Region\" visa on arrival.\n\nBorder control at land borders is fairly strict. If you have a contact in Kurdistan, come armed with their name and address. If you don't, make sure you have a very good idea of what exactly you will be doing and where you will be staying.

No papers or photocopies are needed - all you need is your passport.

Larger cities will have a number of garages. Asking for e.g. \"Garage Sulaymaniyah\" will usually be enough. Minibuses do exist on routes between major cities, but are not as safe as taxis as they may make stops in Kirkuk or Mosul. Taxis are not that cheap - expect prices ranging between 7000 and 20000 dinar (6 to 18 USD) for a seat, but in most places they are the means of transportation. Minibuses cost about the half of taxis and take about 1½ hour for driving the distance a taxi can do in an hour.\n\nInside the big cities are bus services. While confusing timetables are available in shopping malls and major supermarkets - sometimes free of charge. Streets in Kurdistan is often designed in circles, and then named 10 Meter Street, 20m st, 30m st, etc. The bus lines drives fairly often during the day. There are no night buses.\n\nTaxis are everywhere and are either beige or white with a couple of orange squires. Taxis usually charge between 2000 and 6000 dinars for an intra-city trip. Agree on the price before getting in as there are no meters.

Whether it will be in the mountains or in the city parks locals love to spend their free time eating and conversing with friends and family. Invitations to join the fun are not unheard off.\n\nShopping: Erbil and Sulaymaniyah have seen a number of new, modern shopping malls spring up over the last decade. This is the face of the new Kurdistan and there is no reason not to join in - either for the shopping itself or the people-watching.\n\nHospitality: Kurdish culture is famous for hospitality and generosity. You can knock at anyone's door and they will welcome you in. The Kurdish people are very friendly people and they often invite you home for lunch, dinner and even sleep-overs. \n\nWeddings: Coming across a Kurdish wedding is not uncommon. Neither is being invited to participate in the festivity. Kurdish weddings are quite big, with a lot of attending guests. Expect plenty of food and dancing; though only few will offers will include alcohol.\n\nSports: Soccer is big. Plenty of town will have their own soccer field.

Be prepared to have a fairly grubby food experience. The shawarma shops are surprisingly tasty, with slices of meat served in very nice samoon breads - but they aren't exactly A* cuisine. Apart from that, there are a lot of kebab or roast chicken restaurants where you will get some bread, some rice, some soup and some meat.\n\nShould it all be too much is western style fast food available in the big malls. They have outfits like Churchus Chicken, King Burgers, Burger Queens, Pizza Huts, New York Fries, etc...\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nTea, tea and more tea. Everywhere small cafes and street stalls are providing the Kurds with their favourite drink. Start a conversation with a Kurd and it won't take many sentences before you will be offered the first cup.\n\nBottled water is available everywhere, 0.5 L. costs 250 dinars - 20 cents. Some locals do drink the tap water, but it is not recommended.\n\nFruit drinks of every kind are widely available from small shops. Juices, smoothies, blends and other drinks will provide the vitamin C that is rarely part of the local cuisine. \n\nThe majority of Kurdish people are Sunni Muslims, so alcohol is not sold or served just anywhere. Larger cities will have a Christian neighbourhood (like Erbil's Ainkawa) where bars are common and a number of smaller liquor stores - typically identifiable by large signs with the names of international beer brands like Efes, Heineken or Tuborg. Kurdish \"Arak\" a concoction of fermented dates and aniseed is a recommendable - while not necessarily a pleasant - experience, that according to local tradition can \"make the driest eye cry\".\nLocally produced wines make up for what they lack in sophistication with character. In other words: they're disgusting.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nWhile Iraqi Kurdistan is a reasonably safe place, the journey can become dangerous if you cross into contested areas or areas outside the KRG's control.
