[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Welcome banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Irish"]}," is one of the three Goidelic languages, the others being Scottish Gaelic and Manx. This Goidelic branch together with the Brythonic branch (Welsh, Cornish and Breton) form the Celtic language family.  These are spoken in parts of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ireland"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Britain"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["France"]]},".\n\nSome common features of the Celtic languages which strike learners as odd are:\n",{"type":"*","value":["'mutations': sounds change, often at the beginning of words, as part of the grammar, e.g. ",{"type":"''","value":["cat"]}," 'cat', but ",{"type":"''","value":["mo chat"]}," 'my cat'"]},{"type":"*","value":["the verb is usually at the beginning of the sentence"]},{"type":"*","value":["prepositional pronouns that are conjugated, e.g. ",{"type":"''","value":["agam"]}," 'at me', ",{"type":"''","value":["agat"]}," 'at you', etc."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Pronunciation guide"]},"\n\nThere are three major dialects in Irish, named for the three provinces in the north (Ulster, major cities Derry and Belfast), west (Connacht, major city Galway) and south (Munster, major cities Cork, Limerick, Waterford) of the island. The eastern province, (Leinster, major cities Dublin, Kilkenny), no longer has its own distinct dialect. The Caighdeán Oifigiúl (kaigh-DAWN iffig-OOL, official standard) has been in place since the mid-20th century after spelling was 'regularised' (to an extent). This is the official Irish that appears in phrasebooks and in Government publications. It is largely the same as the Munster dialect, with a very few exceptions. There are great differences in pronunciation between the dialects, with Munster differing the most from the other two. For example 'tá go maith', 'yes indeed' is pronunced 'TAY guh MAIGH' in Ulster but 'TAW guh MAH' in Connacht and Munster. There are also differences in the phrases used in everyday speech. In the phrasebook below, the Munster phrase has been used except where indicated. The conjugation of verbs, too, differs from dialect to dialect. Munster uses a contracted form in the past and present first person and in the third person of all three tenses. For example 'tá mé' ('TAW MAY', I am) is 'táim' ('TAW'm') in Munster, and 'bhí mé' (VEE MAY, I was) is 'bhíos' (VEE-us) in Munster. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Vowels"]},"\nThese are the pronunciations of the vowels when stressed (stress with word-initial). Unstressed short vowels (not marked with an accent) are generally pronounced like an 'uh' sound.\n\n; a : like 'o' in \"cod\"\n; á : like 'aw' in \"flaw\"\n; e : like 'e' in \"peg\"\n; é : like 'ay' in \"hay\"\n; i : like 'i' in \"tin\"\n; í : like 'ee' in \"heel\"\n; o : like 'u' in \"bud\"\n; ó : like 'o' in \"home\"\n; u : like 'u' in \"bud\"\n; ú : like 'oo' in \"cool\"\n\n;note: vowel combinations\/diphthongs in Irish (e.g. 'G",{"type":"'''","value":["aei"]},"lge, 's",{"type":"'''","value":["ea"]},"cht",{"type":"'''","value":["ai"]},"n) are slightly rounded and pronounced in the back of the mouth without using the lips at all. (e.g. 'Gaeilge' should not, strictly speaking, be pronounced with a w after the g.) Thus, correct pronunciation can be obtained only from imitating spoken Irish, but the pronunciation guide given here is an adequate enough approximation in that by using it, you will be perfectly understood by any Irish speaker.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Consonants"]},"\nConsonant combinations with ",{"type":"''","value":["h"]}," are sometimes written with a dot (séimhiú, shay-VOO) on the letter instead of the ",{"type":"''","value":["h"]}," and are sometimes silent.

For example, 'ai' in \"Corcaigh\" (the city and county of Cork) is pronounced like the 'i' in \"dig\" but the 'ai' in \"faic\" (nothing) is pronounced like the 'a' in \"hack\", and the 'ai' in \"haigh!\" (hi!, transliteration of a loan-word) is pronounced like the 'i' in \"high\".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Phrase list"]},"\n\nThere are differences in the phrases used in everyday speech in the different provinces.
