In 1920, Kolchak, the once-feared commander of the largest contingent of anti-Bolshevik forces, was executed there, effectively destroying the anti-Bolshevik resistance.\n\nToday, Irkutsk is one of the biggest cities in Siberia, with a growing population of more than 590,000 people.

Knowing at least how to read the signs on the buses and bus stops is helpful, and on the minibuses, one must call out to the driver to request a stop.  Oddly enough, the names of major bus stops are posted on kiosk roofs parallel to the road so that the names are not often visible from inside the bus.  Bus and minibus (\"marshrutka\") fare is usually 12 Rubles. Local etiquitte is to pay the driver when exiting the bus and trolley (therefore you can exit it only thru the front door).
