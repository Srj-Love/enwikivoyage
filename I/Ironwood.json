You can see it from most intersections downtown (the real downtown, not the freeway!). \n\nAnother claim to fame is the 'Copper Peak Ski Jump'. This ski jump is or was the largest freestanding ski jump in North America. When it was built it was the largest in the world. It hasn't been used for jumping since the late 80's. During the summer you can ride the lift up to the top, and get a great view of the forest, and out to Lake Superior. During the winter, they have a snowmobile climb competition on the jump's landing area. This is quite a bit of fun to watch as most snowmobile machines can't handle the slope and go end over end down the hill.\n\nPick up an Ironwood Daily Globe newspaper to check for events happening during the week.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nBuy an Original ",{"type":"'''","value":["Stormy Kromer Cap"]},".

'Little Girl's Point' and 'Black River Harbor' are the two most popular. Turn north off of US 2 on Lake Road to get to either. \n\nHiking: There are several waterfalls and hiking trails along the Black River. If you drive towards Black River Harbor, you will see carved wooden signs near parking lots where you can access these trails. Most trails have basic bathroom facilities available (Closed during winter?). \n\nCamping: You can camp at both Little Girl's Point and Black River Harbor for a fee. Though probably technically not allowed, almost anywhere in the woods along the Black River makes a great camp site. Start on a hiking trail, then head upstream till you find a secluded place.
