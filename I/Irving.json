Part of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, Irving has experienced exponential growth over the past fifty years, and is home to a multitude of attractions of all types, from modern art to major sporting events. Founded in 1902 out of the remnants of the small community of Kit, Irving is now a bustling city of approximately 197,000 residents.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nIrving is bordered on the northwest by ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Dallas\/Fort Worth Airport"],["Dallas\/Fort Worth International Airport"]]}]}," ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.dfwairport.com\/"]},", one of the largest and busiest in the world.

Johnson Freeway) on the north. Dallas' inner loop (Loop 12, or Walton Walker Blvd) borders the city on the east, and Irving is also the current southern terminus for the President George Bush Turnpike.\n\nAdditionally, Irving is traversed by Texas State Highway 183 which runs between Dallas and Ft. Worth.  It connects to both I-35E and I-35W that lead to other major interstates that lead all over the United States.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nIrving's streets are fairly easy to navigate, with most major thoroughfares laid out on a simple grid pattern. Major north-south streets are Belt Line Road, Story Road, MacArthur Blvd. and O'Connor Rd, and east-west include Walnut Hill Ln., Northgate Drive, Rochelle Rd., Irving Blvd. and Rock Island Road. During rush hour most of these streets (as well as the freeways serving the city) can become quite congested, so plan accordingly. For those who prefer to avoid traffic altogether, Irving is also well served by Dallas Area Rapid Transit, or ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.dart.org\/ DART"]},".\n\nIrving indeed has become a victim of any typical western Metropolis' urban sprawl, and a car is the best way to get around the city.  However, the city is serviced quite well by DART, the local mass transit system in the Dallas area.  Recently the Trinity Railway Express has begun operating a rail link between downtown ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dallas"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fort Worth"]]},".  The Trinity Railway Express makes two stops in Irving.  While the fares are surprisingly reasonable ($1.25 to Dallas) the stops are infrecuent, especially on Saturdays and there is no Sunday service.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["The Mustangs of Las Colinas"]},", 5215 N.
