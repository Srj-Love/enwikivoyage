Follow the \"S16\" motorway route until you reach a junction near to \"Pians\" and exit the motorway in the direction of \"Paznauntal - Ischgl\" The drive is just over an hour and is very direct, making the most of Austria's incredibly efficient road network.\n\nBy Train: Ischgl itself has no railway station and neither do any other villages or towns in the entire valley. However, trains from Innsbruck travel as far as Landeck, roughly 2 miles\/ 5 kilometres from the start of the valley Ischgl is located in, the \"Paznauntal.\" Regular bus services operated by \"OBB\", Austria's main public transport operator, run from the station in Landeck (Landeck-Zams),via the central town, to the Paznauntal frequently, making for a relatively simple journey.
