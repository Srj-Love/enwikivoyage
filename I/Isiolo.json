If you tell the touts the night before, they will wake you as soon as the lorries arrive. A ride on top of a goods lorry to Moyale will cost around 1500 Ksh, if you want to ride in the cabin (recommended) then you pay between 2000 to 3000 Ksh, although negotiations will start much higher. There are still certain dangers of being robbed on the road to Moyale, so be aware and keep your eyes open. The shifta (tribal robbers) on the other hand rarely attack foreigners, they are more into cattle theft. It makes sense not to flash expensive cameras and electronics while you are on the route.\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["0.3500"],["37.5833"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Eastern Kenya"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Isiolo"]]}]
