It is roughly ovular with large mountains jetting up in the center. A single road circumvents the island.

It can be done in one day if you move somewhat quickly (8-10 hours, est.). Along the way there are many scenic views, beautiful beaches, and other interesting sights, especially plants and animals. Also, if you have time, a hike up through the mountains will allow you to visit several beautiful lakes.\n\nThere was also quite a bit of damage done by the tsunami to the North Eastern part of the island. The ruins are quite interesting.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nHike. Beach.
