A private island resort community began development on it in 2010, and opened its first rooms in 2013.\n\nIsla Palenque is located off the western Pacific shore of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Panama"]]},", near the border of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Costa Rica"]]},".  Isla ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boca Brava"]]}," is just to the north, semi-attached to Isla Palenque by a sandy land bridge.   Isla Palenque is in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gulf of Chiriquí"]]}," (Golfo de Chiriquí), which is considered by savvy sport fishermen as one of the best kept secrets in big game fishing.\n\nA Palenque originally referred to a refuge for escaped slaves. During ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Central America"]]},"’s colonial period, indigenous Indians were indentured to work in the Spanish mines. Those who escaped sought sanctuary in places they fortified with palisades, or palenques. Isla Palenque has been called by that name for as long as maps can determine, and so may have been used to harbor escapees during the colonial period. \n\nOver the last several hundred years, Isla Palenque let the modern world pass by and has remained a secluded preserve for rare primary forest and hundreds of species of plants, flowers, animals and birds. \n\nAccording to archeologist Olga F. Linares in her book ",{"type":"''","value":["Adaptive Radiations in Prehistoric Panama"]},", Isla Palenque has been a prized location from the start of human settlement, and was the home of an ancient, pre-Columbian farming community some time during the years 500-1400AD. It may even have been occupied as long ago as 5,000BC. Due to the beauty and mystery of the island, it became a sacred site for the most holy of ceremonies, and tribes from all over the province came here to worship. Important tribal chiefs were known to negotiate and trade with each other, making this the province’s prime center of culture and commerce. By Colonial times this ancient community had vanished, leaving only enough clues about their lives to awaken curiosity and provide a sense of the island's ancient history.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nFrom ",{"type":"[[","value":[["David (Panama)"],["David"]]},"'s Enrique Malek International Airport: \nIsla Palenque can be accessed by boat from the small fishing village of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boca Chica"]]},", just 5 miles from Isla Palenque over water.
