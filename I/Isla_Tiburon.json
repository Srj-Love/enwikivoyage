The mexican marines who had bases on the island prevented the Seri indians from landing or hunting on the island despite the fact that the island had always been Seri territory. By the 70's this changed and the rights of the Seri were recognized. Today, the indians don't hunt on the islands instead permits are auctioned off to wealthy Americans and the proceeds are split. Half is allocated to the Seri, the remainder is used to finance conservation efforts. If you are interested in hunting save your pesos, permits typically sell for ~$75,000USD!!\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nOriginally populated by the Seri Indian tribe, they have since been relocated to the mainland.

The island is part of the Sonoran desert. Winter temperatures are nearly ideal, while summer can be deadly. Strong winter winds can be a concern in December and January. Late winter to early spring is probably the ideal time of year to visit.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Get in"]}," This is the hard part, you must first obtain a permit then arrange a boat across the straits of hell from mainland Sonora. The straits are aptly named and 10 foot waves and strong winds are not uncommon. Be sure to hire a sea worthy fishing boat for the crossing. The crossing takes about 5 hours in rough seas, considerably less when waters are calm.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\nPermits are required to visit the island.

In fact the most obvious sign of human activity you'll see during your visit are the shrimp vessels and small fishing pangas working the waters just off the island during the night and early morning.
