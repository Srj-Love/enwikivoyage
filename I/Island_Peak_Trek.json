It can be climbed as part of several different trekking itineraries.\n    \n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Island Peak"]}," was originally named by Eric Shipton in 1952 (some sources say 1951) and was so named because it sits in the middle of the upper Chhukhung valley, like an island in the middle of a sea of ice. It was officially renamed ",{"type":"'''","value":["Imja Tse"]}," in the early 1980s. ",{"type":"''","value":["Imja Tse"]}," simply means ",{"type":"''","value":["Island Peak"]}," in Nepali.\n\nMuch of the upper Khumbu Valley is within Sagarmatha National Park. The park was created in 1976 and was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1979. It was first climbed in 1953 as part of a training exercise by a British expedition that went on to summit Mt Everest. Sherpa Tenzing Norgay, who was one of the first two humans credited with climbing Mount Everest, was also one of the first to summit Island Peak.\n\nIt's considered to be a moderately easy peak by alpine standards and can be attempted by people with little or no alpine experience. Normally, trekking\/climbing organizations offer to teach the novice Alpinist what they need to know to attempt the peak.\n\nIsland Peak can be climbed during two seasons on either side of the monsoon, spring (mid-March to May) and autumn (mid-September to November). It's possible to climb the peak during the winter but cold temperatures will present additional difficulties.\n\nThe summit of Island Peak is at 6,189m so the rate of elevation gain and the consequent risk of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Altitude sickness"]]}," or specifically ",{"type":"'''","value":["Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS)"]}," is a very real concern. Your general fitness and your acclimatization process will both be very important.\n\nThe trek to Island Peak initially follows the main ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Everest Base Camp Trek"]]}," route, but separates near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dingboche"]]},". Most teams attempting the mountain will initially fly to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lukla"]]}," and hike from there. Although itineraries include an attempt to summit Island Peak, many people visit the area as trekkers. If you are trekking and not climbing, there are additional options for exploring the Khumbu region.\n\nBe aware that weather conditions around Lukla and Island Peak, as well as Kathmandu, may play havoc with flights and trekking\/climbing schedules. It's best to be flexible with your arrival and departure dates and even be prepared to have the expedition cancelled completely, almost without notice.\n\nIf you succeed in reaching the summit of Island Peak, you'll be rewarded with views of nearby mountains such as ",{"type":"{{","value":[["marker"],["type=view"],["name=Mount Everest"],["lat=27.98786"],["long=86.92480"]]},", Lhotse, Nuptse and others in the immediate vicinity.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Prepare"]},"\nAlthough many trekking\/climbing organizations do offer to teach novices everything they need to know to enable them to climb this peak, it hardly bears mentioning that any prospective climber will be far better off if they have at least some experience with climbing rope management, alpine equipment such as harnesses, ascenders, crampons, ice axes and so on. The better your general fitness and conditioning, the greater will be your chances of success and you will actually enjoy your climb more. Most big peaks involve a certain amount of suffering, so anything you can do in advance to reduce that suffering will be to your advantage.\n\nSome trekking organizations try to set up abbreviated itineraries (about 14 days) that allow participants the chance to hike to the peak and climb it as quickly as possible. Obviously, this is only really feasible if you are fit, somewhat acclimatized and have some alpine experience. If none of those conditions apply to you, then find (or arrange) a trek and climb that allows extra time for you acclimatize, develop reasonable fitness and learn how to use climbing equipment. Itineraries from some companies are around 19 days of trekking and climbing plus travel to and from Kathmandu.\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.nepalmountaineering.org\/ Nepal Mountaineering Association"]}]}," lists Imja Tse as a \"Group B\" climbing peak. If you intend to climb this peak, you must be accompanied by a Sirdar\/Guide who must be registered with the Nepal Mountaineering Association. The rules associated with climbing peaks in Nepal list a wide variety of duties of the Sirdar\/Guide. You should familiarize yourself with these duties.\n\nGroup B trekking peaks incur a permit fee of USD350 for a group of up to 4 climbers with an additional USD40 per person over that number. There will also be a USD250 deposit to ensure compliance with garbage regulations.\n\nTrekkers will also need a ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.timsnepal.com\/ TIMS card"]}]},". If you are a part of a guided group, you will need a \"blue\" TIMS card (NPR1,000). If you are an independent trekker, you will need a \"green\" TIMS card (NPR2,000). These cards must be registered at various checkpoints along the trail. You will NOT need a TIMS card if you have a climbing permit, which you will have if your primary objective is to climb Island Peak.\n\nIf you wish to have a trekking\/climbing company organize everything, an option which does offer certain advantages, you will need to find one with a good reputation. There are hundreds of such companies so finding one can be an interesting process. You could start by looking at companies registered with the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.taan.org.np\/ Trekking Agencies' Association of Nepal"]}]},". Possibly the best way to locate a suitable company is to rely on recommendations from people you know.\n\nArrange for rescue insurance.  Some insurance companies will cover you if you are hiking but NOT if you are mountaineering (ie: climbing a peak).  Make sure you know what you are getting.  If you are hiring a trekking company, you will almost certainly have to provide this information to the guide and the agency before you leave for the trek.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nIn the \"old days\" people visiting the Everest area would simply trek there from Kathmandu. You'd have lots of time over a couple of weeks to get fit and acclimatize. That's not usually what people do now. Most will now opt to fly from Kathmandu to Lukla and pay about USD161 to do so. Consequently, there are dozens of flights in and out of Lukla each day and if weather causes delays, things can get backed up very, very quickly.\n\nThe organized itineraries offered by trekking companies, which you will likely be using, all include a flight from Kathmandu to Lukla and back to Kathmandu the same way at the trek's end. It's always possible, however, to have trekking companies set up whatever custom options you want. With that in mind, there are four other possible places to start your trek into the Khumbu and end up at Island Peak if you have a few additional days:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["marker"],["type=silver"],["name=Shivalaya"],["lat=27.60810"],["long=86.30104"]]}," - about six days south-west of Lukla.

This option is a good way to avoid the crowds and is perhaps the only good reason to take it, other than as an excellent fitness exercise. This route isn't particularly impressive for scenery and because it crosses rather than follows river valleys, there is an inordinate amount of up and down. One estimate suggests that by the time you reach Lukla you will have accumulated nearly 9,000m of elevation gain, more than climbing Everest from sea level!

It takes about 6 days to hike from Barahbise (Bahrabise) to Shivalaya through part of Nepal that isn't much visited by trekkers. It would be important to have a guide for this route (or some ability in Nepali) as well as camping equipment because accommodation for trekkers is pretty sparse and even locals might not be able to explain the right direction to you. The route starts at 820m and rises to cross the Tingsang La (3,320m)  and then wanders through high meadows, pastures and forests and eventually to  Shivalaya.

It's best to get this entrance permit before you leave Kathmandu. Trekkers from SAARC countries must pay an entry fee of NPR1,500, other foreigners NPR3,000 and Nepalis NPR25.
