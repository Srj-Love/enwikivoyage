There are few, if any, permanent human inhabitants on these islands. Those that do inhabit this area of the world are often scientists and weather observers.  Access to these destinations generally requires mounting an expedition. You may need permission to visit these desinations as many are wildlife sanctuaries or have unique environments.  Special environmental conditions may be imposed.

Storms sweeping off Antarctica, unobstructed by any land, bring cold strong winds, rain or snow and rough seas to the region. This part of the world is the preserve of deep sea fishing ships (not boats), warships on fisheries patrols, oceanographic research ships, round-the-world yachts and the occasional icebreaker on its way to Antarctica.
