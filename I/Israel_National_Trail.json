Walking in the land where the Bible stories unfold and seeing the evidence and the archeological sites of many familiar tales from childhood make the trail a holy and spiritual experience for every human being. Crossing many villages and towns, the INT is full of choices and possibilities. \n\nOne can sleep near civilization or be one with the wilderness. One can choose to carry five days of food or re-supply almost everyday. It is up to each individual to decide what kind of INT experience is right for him\/her.\n\nThe INT gives one the chance to experience superb desert scenery in a relatively accessible way. When hiking the INT, one is never more than a one day's hike from a road or two days to a reliable water source. Magnificent desert colors, animals and flowers are some of the many wonderful highlights.\n\nIn Israel, the majority of people speak English as a second language and are more than willing to help. One will not recognize this picturesque Israel from the pictures seen on television news, which typically only depict the conflict which occurs in small sections of a largely conflict-free land. One who visits will have a better understanding of the place that is constantly in world headlines.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Route"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Israel National Trail.jpg"],["thumb"],["At the train near \"Meron\" stream"]]},"\nThe trail passes through the following localities (among others):\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Galilee"]]}]},"\nDan (Kibbutz), Tel Dan, Hasbani River, Ma'ayan Baruch (Kibbutz), Kfar Giladi (Kibbutz near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Metula"]]},"), Tel Hai (near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Qiryat Shemona"]]},"), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mount Meron"]]},", near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Safed"]]},", Hukok (Kibbutz), Mount Arbel, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sea of Galilee"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tiberias"]]},", Jordan River, Mount Tavor, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nazareth"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zippori"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Israeli North Coast"],["North Coast"]]}]},"\nYagur (Kibbutz), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Carmel Range"]]},", Nahal Me'arot Nature Reserve, near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zikhron Ya'akov"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Israeli Coastal Plain"],["Coastal Plain"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Caesarea"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hadera"]]},", Nahal Alexander, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Netanya"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Herzliya"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tel Aviv\/North"],["northern"]]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tel Aviv"]]},", Antipatris, Givat HaShlosha (Kibbutz near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Petah Tikva"]]},"), Mazor Mausoleum\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Shfela"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jerusalem"]]}," Mountains"]},"\nBen Shemen Forest, Ajalon, Latrun, Burma Road, Tzova (Kibbutz), near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jerusalem"]]}," (connecting to the Jerusalem Trail), Netiv HaLamed-Heh (Kibbutz), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beth Guvrin"]]},", Tel Lachish\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Negev"]]}]},"\nDvir (Kibbutz), Lahav (Kibbutz near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lehavim"]]},"), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Metar"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Arad (Israel)"],["Arad"]]},", HaMakhtesh HaKatan, Sde Boker (Kibbutz), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mitzpe Ramon"]]},", Arabah, Neot Semadar (Kibbutz), Timna Valley, Eilat Mountains, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Eilat"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["FAQ"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["style"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["When is the best time to hike the trail?"]},"\n\nThere are two good seasons: October to November & February to mid-May. \n\nDuring February to mid-May, the landscape is green and the flowers are blooming, more water is available in the creeks, and the rivers up north are much more impressive.\n\nWinter is also a good time to hike the INT. \n\nIn both seasons you can expect rain in the northern part of the trail.

One wouldn’t need to carry more than five day's worth of food. Every village, town and kibbutz usually has a grocery store. As may be expected, the bigger the community, the bigger and better-supplied the stores will be.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["How much water should one carry?"]},"\n\nUntil one gets to Arad traveling southward (assuming no abnormally hot conditions), five liters per person per day should be enough for drinking and cooking. More would be necessary for ¨bottled showers¨ or dish-washing. There is no place along this northern part that one would need to carry more than one day's water supply.\n\nFrom Arad to Eilat six to seven liters per day are needed. One would have a 2-3 days between water sources. You should cache water in the desert in designated places. On hot days (30c +) more water is needed. (See the water-drop question.)\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Where should one start?\/Which direction should one go?"]},"\nThe most common way is ",{"type":"'''","value":["North to South"]}," and doing it this way has certain benefits: \n\na. The northern part is easier and gives your body a better chance to get in shape, acclimatize and adjust to the trail life. The amount of water you need to carry is smaller and again it gives your body time to get stronger.\n\nb. During the Spring start in early March or late February in Eilat. You will each the north with all the green and flowers still at their peak.\n\nc. In Spring consider starting in Tel Aviv and go south. From Eilat take a bus to Dan and go to Tel Aviv. The finish in Tel Aviv is very rewarding.\n\nd. The finish line of Eilat is generally more rewarding than the region of Dan in the north. Eilat is a resort town filled with luxury hotels, which will likely be more relaxing and rewarding than Kibbutz Dan's, especially when contrasted to the desert that one is exiting.\n\ne. There are many more villages and kibbutzes on the northern part with more resupply possibilities. For most of the hikers it's the first long trail they have experienced and many mistakes are made with water, food and gear. These mistakes are much easier to ¨fix¨ on the northern part of the trail. By the time one gets to the desert, important lessons on water and food quantities and gear should have been learned. \n\nf. Expect however more rainy days in the north during March-April and consequently more delays.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["South to North"]},": \n\na. If one is hiking in the spring it makes more sense to hike the desert section before it gets too hot. Hiking in May in the desert is associated with more very hot days when one must stop the day's hike at about 10AM and continue hiking in the afternoon, when temperatures drop.\n\nb. There is a higher likelihood of experiencing desert floods after a heavy rain, which are beautiful. However, such rains and floods can also be dangerous. Floods are not frequent in the desert section of INT.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Where can I get more information?"]},"\n\nThere are currently some English resources on the Trail:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" English language guide book.

A long-time veteran and founder of SPNI, Ori Devir contemplated the idea, fell in love it, and began the long process of establishing the Trail. Devir and his team collected ideas and feedback from tour guides, park rangers, hikers and veteran nature lovers. After much investigation, bureaucracy and hard work, 15 years later ITC opened the Israel Trail with then President Ezer Weitzman conducting the ceremony on Passover 1995. \n\nMost of the actual Israel Trail was patched together from the network of thousands of kilometers of pre-existing trails across the country. The trail system stringently protects environmental concerns and each region's character. The Israel Trail was originally intended for hiking by foot only, but as a result of jeeps driving the trails, some sections of the trail are now accessible not only to jeeps, but to regular private cars. You can get to the trail by foot, car and even public transit. Along the trail, informational signs feature maps, background on the area and interesting sites, trail rules and emergency phone numbers. \n\nIn 1994, Yariv Ya'ari was the first person to hike the entire Israel Trail and he completed the trail in 21 days. More and more people began to hike the Israel Trail and today tens of thousands of people hike the Israel Trail every year! In October 2006, Avraham Tamir's young son Mickey Tamir hiked the Israel Trail to mark his father's 100th birthday and his own 60th birthday. Thousands of groups hike a section of the Israel Trail, hiking once a month or so, until they complete the entire trail within two years.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Support the Development of the Israel Trail"]}," \nITC envisions the Israel Trail approaching the utility of its mentor (the Appalachian Trail) in a few key respects. First, the lack of water stations is a critical problem on the Israel Trail, particularly in the southern sections. Secondly, the Israel Trail has no shelters at all.
