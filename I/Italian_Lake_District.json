Well-known gardens include those of the Isola Madre, Isola Bella and the Isole di Brissago, that of the Villa Taranto in Pallanza near Verbania, and the Alpinia botanical garden above Stresa.

It is about 2.5 km. in width on average, although twice as wide near Luino. The Borromean Bay between Stresa and Verbania, is blessed with three islands known as the Borromean Islands.  These islands are not to be missed on a visit to Lake Maggiore.  Isola Bella is known for its baroque palace and gardens, Isola Pescatori for it's fishing character with its typical lake boats and the scenic Isola Madre is known for its gardens. The lake’s jagged banks are surrounded by the Prealps of Piedmont and Lombardy. The western bank is in Piedmont (provinces of Novara and Province of Verbano-Cusio-Ossola) and the eastern in Lombardy (province of Varese), whereas the most northerly section extends thirteen kilometres into Switzerland, where it constitutes the lowest point above sea-level in that entire country.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Regions"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Lake Maggiore"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Lake Como"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Lake Garda"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Lake Lugano"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Lake Iseo"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Lake Orta"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Lake Varese"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Lake of Monate"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Lombardy"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\n\nThe main points of access to the regions are: ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Milan"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bergamo"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brescia"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Verona"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Switzerland Piedmont Lombardy"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ranzo"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gerra"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Nazzaro"]]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vira"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Magadino"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tenero"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Locarno"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[": Large Swiss town on the northern part of Lake Maggiore, with casino and ferry to other towns on the lake."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ascona"]]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ronco sopra Ascona"]]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brissago"]]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Minusio"]]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cannobio"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[": Small Italian town 10 minutes from the Swiss border on the West side of the Lake Maggiore, with a large campsite, a sport complex, a lakeside walkpath, a Sunday market, a renaissance church, and a few hotels.
