This peak is visible to the northwest of Resende when driving between São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro on the Via Dutra highway, which is the easiest route to get there.\n\nThe park attracts bird watchers from all over the world with its 250 species of birds. Other attractions include hiking and rock climbing.\n\nThe park is surrounded by the Mantiqueira Mountain Environmental Protection Area which provides an ecological buffer zone for the park.\n\nThe park is divided in two areas: high and low. The high area is accessible through an entrance about 35 km from the main entrance and gives access to the Pico das Agulhas Negras and Prateleiras complex. Josef Mengele lived in this area after World War II.\n\nThe low area of the park is much closer to the city of Itatiaia and has many waterfalls, such as Véu da Noiva with 45 meters.

Prateleiras is an easy climb but Agulhas Negras is a little tougher, and requires some effort, if not actual moutaineering skills. Due to an arson attack a few years ago, which resulted in a huge fire that destroyed most of the area's vegetation (it has since recovered), access is only possible with a registered guide or agency. These can be hired through the local pousadas (small hotels).
