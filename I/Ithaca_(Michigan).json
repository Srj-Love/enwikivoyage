Nestled in the center of Michiganâ€™s Lower Peninsula, Ithaca greets visitors from all corners of the state. Ithaca serves as the county seat of Gratiot County, and is mid-point of the US-127 university corridor of Central Michigan University, Alma College, and Michigan State University.  The Ithaca Downtown Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and is on Business US-127 along the former \"Old 27\" route.  Ithaca's best known landmark is the masterfully preserved Gratiot County Courthouse, which has in its front lawn the Gratiot All Wars Memorial Monument.  Just down the street you will find another beautiful landmark, the Ithaca Fire Hall, which once served as the original Village Hall.  In the summer months, visitors to Ithaca are greeted by beautiful flowers planted by area youth and community members, stretching along both sides of Business US-127 from the City Limits to downtown.  Woodland Park is filled with rolling hills, mature trees, and a volunteer-built playscape, as well as a large sledding hill for winter use.  Ithaca hosts several annual events, including the Ithaca Hometown Funfest (August), Dust Off Car Show (May), Gratiot Ag Society Fair (June), Old US 27 Motor Tour (August), as well as many other seasonal events.   \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nLocated on US-127 about 35 minutes north of Lansing, the city of Ithaca is easily accessible from all parts of the state of Michigan by car.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nThe Great Lakes Central Railroad bisects Ithaca, used predominately for freight service.
