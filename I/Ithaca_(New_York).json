Even Cornell University is a study in contrasts: it has the noble, refined air of the Ivy League school that it is, yet as the state's land-grant university, it excels in agricultural and veterinary research.\n\nIthaca has a humid continental climate, and is markedly cooler than New York City. Winter is cold, sometimes bitterly so, with temperatures reaching 0°F or lower several times a year. There is also significantly more snow and more cloudy days than along most of the coast. The best time of year to visit is summer, as it is the sunniest and driest season; days are pleasantly warm but rarely too hot, and nights are crisp.

It is generally best to avoid driving to campus at all. Bus service onto campus from downtown and other areas of Ithaca runs  frequently during the day. One hassle-free and relatively fast parking option for visiting campus during the day is to park at the Seneca and Tioga streets parking garage in downtown Ithaca and then ride the Route 10 bus to campus. Route 10 departs from a heated bus stop located inside the parking garage every 10 minutes (7:30AM-5:00PM on weekdays, less frequently later in the evening) and the ride to Cornell takes only a few minutes.  Check TCATbus ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.tcatbus.com"]}," for schedules and more information. \n\nIf you have to park on campus during the day, you will need to buy a visitor parking permit from one of the parking booths around campus, and then you can park in a spot labeled for visitor parking, which are few and far between. The parking booth attendant can give you a map showing visitor parking spots, but during a school day expect not to find anything. There are several small metered lots, including one behind Willard Straight Hall and one in the lower level of the parking garage by the football stadium, that are convenient to central campus but are often full. Larger (and rarely full) metered lots are located across from the Dairy Bar and next to Bartels Hall, but both are at least a 15 minute brisk walk to most places on central campus. After 5 PM, some of the various \"tiered\" parking lots are available for general parking, but be sure to read the signs, as many lots have restricted parking until 8PM or 10PM and others are restricted at all times. If you are arriving on campus by car during normal business hours, expect to spend at least 10 to 15 minutes looking for parking, and 10 to 15 minutes more walking from your parking spot to your destination, so plan to arrive on campus at least 30 minutes before you need to be somewhere. You can park for free or for cheaper off campus in Collegetown or in Cayuga Heights, but expect your walk to be 20-30 minutes to your destination if it is on central campus.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Ithaca College"]},"\nThe parking situation at ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ithaca College"]}," is also equally as poor, as over the past few years, there hasn't been enough parking for on-campus students, despite significant fee increases and discounted public transit passes. The only sanctioned visitor parking is a frequently full,  visitor lot located near the football stadium, and half a dozen spots near the main administrative building (Peggy R. Williams) for visitors to the office of admissions. Elsewhere parking is reserved based on a color coded permit system, which is strictly enforced during the week - park without a permit and your car will definitely be ticketed, and very possibly towed. On weekends, red (student) lots open up to visitor parking.\n\nIf you are visiting a specific person on campus (such as staying overnight with an on-campus student) you may be able to obtain a temporary permit from Public Safety. Availability is not guaranteed and if granted, you will be restricted to a specific lot, usually one intended for commuters. You will need your vehicle registration and proof of insurance to obtain the permit.\n\nThe following are official exceptions often made for special events:\n",{"type":"*","value":["During School of Music concerts, attendee parking is permitted in lot nearest the Towers and the Whalen parking bridge (J Lot West)"]},{"type":"*","value":["Patrons attending IC Theatre events may park in the lot directly behind Dillingham (Lot F)"]},{"type":"*","value":["For Bombers home games, fans may park in the large lot near Butterfield stadium (Lot L)"]},{"type":"*","value":["Participants at conferences or events held in the Emerson Suites may park in the Campus Center Lot (Lot U)"]},"\nMany off campus students either walk or take the bus to school.
