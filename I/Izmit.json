Multiple private coach (bus) companies schedule regular journeys from Istanbul's two major bus terminals (Harem Otogar on the Asian side, and Esenler Otogar on the European side).  Efe Tur and Izmit Tur (the two main coach companies operating in Izmit) run buses daily every 15–20 minutes from both bus terminals starting at 7:00 AM until 10:00 PM.  The fair is 10.00 TL from the Harem bus terminal, or 12.00 TL from the Esenler bus terminal.\n\nEfe Tur and Izmit Tur will generally drop off passengers arriving from Istanbul in Izmit's city center, rather than Izmit's main bus terminal.\n\nIzmit's bus terminal is located in the Yahyakaptan neighborhood, which is approx. 2 km away from the city center.  There are many mini-buses (dolmus) running from Izmit's main bus terminal to the city center.  In addition, the major bus liens (Efe Tur and Izmit Tur) offer free shuttle services to the main neighborhoods around Izmit.\n\nIt is also possible to travel to or from any major city in Turkey from Izmit's main bus terminal.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Clock Tower"],["alt=Saat Kulesi"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=at downtown"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=An elegant clock tower dating back to 1901.
