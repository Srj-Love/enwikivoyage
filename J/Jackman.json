[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/jackmanmaine.org Jackman"]}]}," is a town in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kennebec and Moose River Valleys"],["Moose River Valley"]]}," area of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Maine"]]},".  The area is called the \"Switzerland of Maine\" in local promotional literature as it's located in the western mountainous part of Maine.  It represents an outpost of humanity in the sea of forest that engulfs the northwestern half of the state.  \nThe economy of the Valley has historically been based in wood products and the railroad.  Over the last hundred years tourism and border traffic with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Canada"]]}," has become increasingly important, since the town is a way station for travelers headed to and from Canada, being the only regular crossing into and from Quebec on the Maine border with Canada.  As such, it has an interesting modern history.  Most of the town's population is of French extraction, and many locals are fluent in French (",{"type":"''","value":["On parle Francais, comme on dit."]},") It had an interesting Prohibition era experience--many of the town's oldest living inhabitants, as well as the parents and grandparents of most of the rest, were bootleggers. Since 9\/11 the population of the town has increased as dozens more \"homeland security\" personnel have been assigned there. Muhammad Atta and one of the other hijackers purportedly came through the Jackman crossing on their way to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Portland (Maine)"],["Portland"]]},", where they flew to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boston"]]}," to catch their final flight.   \n\nAll that luridness aside, the primary reason most travelers come to Jackman herself (other than those en route to Quebec) is to enjoy the many outdoor recreation opportunities in the Valley. \n\nWeather: ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.answers.com\/topic\/jackman-maine?cat=travel"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["The nearest large airport is in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bangor (Maine)"],["Bangor"]]},"."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Newton Field "]},", 369 Main St, +1 207 668-2111, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.airnav.com\/airport\/59B"]},".

Historically, the Native Americans and European Colonists travelled by water, however, given the impassibility of the woods.\n\nThe Kennebec\/Chaudière watersheds define the region. Jackman is set at the headwaters of the Kennebec River, which is the watershed that drains the center of the state.  The two mains lakes in the town's boundaries, ",{"type":"'''","value":["Attean Lake"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Big Wood Lake"]}," are both a part of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Moose River"]},", a tributary of the Kennebec.  The Moose flows east from Jackman into ",{"type":"'''","value":["Moosehead Lake"]}," (the largest in Maine, near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Greenville (Maine)"],["Greenville"]]},") and then into the Kennebec which flows out of Moosehead to the southeast back past a small town called The Forks (year round population about 30, base for the rafting industry in the area, located about a half hour south of Jackman on Route 201, where the Dead River & Kennebec converge.)  The Kennebec River then continues south to Skowhegan and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Waterville (Maine)"],["Waterville"]]},", past the state capital ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Augusta (Maine)"],["Augusta"]]},", to the sea.\n\nImmediately to the north is the Chaudière watershed, which flows into the St. Lawrence. There is a coalition of the Maine and Quebec Tourism offices which may be of interest, the Kennebec-Chaudière International Corridor ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.kennebec-chaudiere.com\/"]},".\n\nThe Native Americans would winter on the coast, and travel by canoe inland in the spring to the headwaters of the Kennebec to hunt and gather other resources.  Mount Kineo on Mooosehead (near Rockwood, 30 minutes to the east of Jackman) was a primary source for flint, for example.  Most of the Rivers (not to mention many other place names in Maine) are derived from Native American names that describe the place, as a sort of trip tik or description of the locale. The name \"Kennebec\" signifies \"where alewives are cured\" - in reference to a place on the river (probably near or on the coast) where  the Native Americans dried fish.  The many other names of Native American derivation in Maine have similar meanings.\n\nThe Post Colonial era just as fascinating.  In 1775, Benedict Arnold led an expedition of 750 men by boat up the Kennebec by Jackman, then onto the Chaudiere in a failed attack on Quebec City.  \n\nIn 1853, Henery David Thoreau took a train to Greenville, and then canoed from Greenville, by way of two mile long portages, to Bangor.  His guide was a Penobscot Indian named Joe Attean, his name being the same as that of Attean Lake, in Jackman (the derivation of the name is probably from the French name Etienne, or Steven, which shows how the three cultures, Native, French and English, melded). Note that Jackman is at the head of that same watershed, and that if you are willing to portage two separate one mile portages, you can canoe from Jackman (or Greenville, say) all the way to either Bangor (down the Penobscot watershed) or St. John, New Brunswick (\"up\" the Allagash onto the St. John watershed) to the sea.  \n\nThe above is only mentioned by way of describing what has been done by ancients and heroes. It is in no way an endorsement or suggestion.\nIt would take roughly two weeks & a bit of logistical support to canoe from Jackman to Bangor (say) - a radical trip.  Just know it can be done.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nIt's all about the beauty of nature, especially in autumn when the trees are painted and the air is crisp.  The winter is also sublime, with snow cloaking the spruce and fir, creating a winter wonderland to equal anything in Currier & Ives.  The summer is very pleasant, warm, and usually sunny, and rarely very hot or humid.  The spring, from April through early or mid June is perhaps the least interesting time of year, and historically has been black fly and mosquito spawning season.
