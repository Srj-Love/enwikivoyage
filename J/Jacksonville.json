Set amongst abundant beaches and an ideal subtropical climate, its crown jewel is the unique habitat and natural beauty of the St. Johns River. The River City, just one of Jacksonville's nicknames, is the largest city proper in Florida and largest city, by area, in the contiguous United States.\n\nWhile Jacksonville doesn't have the concentration of tourist amenities present in its southern-neighbors, like Orlando and Miami, there is no shortage of activities as you discover its rich history. Once holding the distinctions of Insurance Capital of the South and Winter Film Capital of the World, not to mention possessing a formidable financial industry, this underrated cultural center is a composite of northern aesthetics and southern charm. In combination with rich architectural diversity, influential African-American ancestry, and substantial musical contributions, Jacksonvillians have garnered international appeal for their relatively small piece of the world.\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nJacksonville is in the First Coast region of northeast Florida and is centered on the banks of the St. Johns River, about 25 miles (40 km) south of the Georgia state line and about 340 miles (547 km) north of Miami. The Jacksonville Beaches communities are along the adjacent Atlantic coast. The area was originally inhabited by the Timucua people, and in 1564 was the site of the French colony of Fort Caroline, one of the earliest European settlements in what is now the continental United States. Under British rule, settlement grew at the narrow point in the river where cattle crossed, known as Wacca Pilatka to the Seminole and Cowford to the British. A platted town was established there in 1822, a year after the United States acquired the colony of Florida from Spain; it was named after Andrew Jackson, the first military governor of the Florida Territory and seventh President of the United States.\n\nJacksonville is the largest city in the U.S. state of Florida based on population, and the largest city by area in Florida and the contiguous United States. It is the county seat of Duval County, with which the city government consolidated in 1968. Consolidation gave Jacksonville its great size and placed most of its metropolitan population within the city limits; with a population of 827,908, it is the most populous city in Florida, and the eleventh most populous in the United States. Jacksonville is the principal city in the Greater Jacksonville Metropolitan Area, with a population of 1,345,596 in 2010.\n\nHarbor improvements since the late 19th century have made Jacksonville a major military and civilian deep-water port. Its river line location facilitates two U.S. Navy bases and the Port of Jacksonville, Florida's third largest seaport. Significant factors in the local economy include services such as banking, insurance, healthcare and logistics. As with much of Florida, tourism is also important to the Jacksonville area, particularly tourism related to golf. In 2010, Jacksonville was listed as a \"High sufficiency\" world city in the World Cities Study Group’s inventory. It ranks alongside cities such as Salt Lake City and Las Vegas.\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.flyjacksonville.com\/ Jacksonville International Airport"]}]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["JAX"]]},") .
