Taxis can do the 3hr drive for Port-au-prince at a set upon rate.  Another (much less favorable) option would be to take a very crowded public bus, which should not be attempted for the fainthearted or those seeking comfort as they're always packed.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nJacmel is not a spread out city and everything can easily be seen on foot.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nThe city is very walkable and pleasant, and due to the fact it's facing the Caribbean Sea, the breeze in from the ocean make it quite enjoyable (much more so then most other inland cities in Haiti).  The city itself is great visually and photographically as well as having some of the friendliest people in the country.  Small local craft stores also abound and it's noted for one of the best places to buy Haitian handicrafts and souvenirs.\n\nThe buildings in the city are historic and date from the early nineteenth century; the city has been tentatively accepted as a World Heritage site and UNESCO reports that it has sustained damage in the January 2010 earthquake.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nJacmel is the sort of place that is wonderful to spend a laid-back day wandering the streets and enjoying a slow pace (which is a very rare trait in a country such as Haiti), and the ideal day would include a couple hours walking the city aimlessly taking in the old grand architecture, followed by a nice seafood or Creole meal and a leisurely swim at the beach located on the Hotel Cyvadier property grounds -- which is open to the public but very hard to find for those not in-the-know (ask a local or a cab driver to point the way).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\nExcellent craft\/souvenir shops are easy to spot while walking around the town.  Do bargain (playfully but firm in what you believe is a fair cost) as prices will be inflated for Westerners.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Hotel Kabic Beach Club"],["url=http:\/\/www.kabicbeachclub.com\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=509)  3780 6850"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=$90.00+"],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=12 room hotel right on the beach with views over the ocean from every room.
