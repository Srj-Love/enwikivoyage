[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Caribbean default banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Jaco Beach Costa Rica .jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Jaco Beach."]]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Jacó"]}," is one of the two largest tourist towns on the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Central Pacific"],["Central Pacific Coast"]]}," of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Costa Rica"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\nJacó is about 130km from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Jose (Costa Rica)"],["San Jose"]]},"'s airport, a beautiful drive of just over two hours.\n\nFrom Juan Santamaria International Airport, follow the signs toward San Ramon. After 10km, take the exit toward Atenas and at the stop sign, turn left. Follow the winding street until you get to San Mateo. At San Mateo, the road jogs right a block because of one way traffic (towards you). Just follow the road around and you will get back on the main drag. When approaching Orotonia, a sign directs you to the right. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Don't follow it!"]}," (you'll get lost in the business district). Stay straight until you see the sign on the right directing you to Jacó. Follow that road to Jacó. From here, it is just following signs to Jacó.\n\nThere are frequent buses going directly from the Coca Cola bus station in San José. Fares are about USD5 each way. \n\nIf you want to leave from SJO airport directly to Jaco you can use ",{"type":"'''","value":["Easy Ride Shuttle Services"]},". They run 3 times per day from 07:00 from SJO airport to Jaco. They also pick up at any hotel in San Jose downtown or Alajuela downtown.\n\nAlternatively, drive from San Jose past San Ramon toward ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Puntarenas (city)"],["Puntarenas"]]},", until you get to Hwy 27. Go south on 27 and follow the signs to Jaco. It's further, but much faster since it is not a mountain road. Another plus is that you can stop at the bridge over the Tarcoles River along the way, a prime spot to observe wild crocodiles. Note, it is illegal to feed the crocodiles as they are protected.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get around "]},"\nTransportation in and around Jaco is quite simple. The city is small enough, that walking from one end to the other is not an impossible feat. But when it's hot, or it's dark, there are always plenty of taxis to take you down the strip wherever you might want to go. The taxis in Jaco are red. Don't get in a taxi that does not look official. Often there are pirate taxis that are generally safe, but it's best to stick with the official companies. There's a taxi stand by the main grocery store, Mas por Menos, or you can always pick one up easily outside of Beatle Bar.  All official taxis have meters and are clearly displayed. CRC1,500 is a standard price to go just about anywhere in the town, or to Herradura, unless it's a short distance and then it's usually CRC750. Ask a local if you are unsure of how much you should pay.\n\nThere are local buses that circulate from Herradura to Jaco every hour. The bus does not go through all of Jaco, it does not travel to the most Northern side, but it you can get off at any spot in central Jaco, along the strip. The main bus stop to go to Herradura is located across the street and down the road a short distance from the grocery store, Mas o Menos. There is a bus stop there, and usually a congregation of people waiting for the bus to come. If you take the bus from Herradura to Jaco you can pick it up at Herradura beach, at the crossways of the Costanera in Herradura, or down the road at the Herradura gas station, otherwise known as La Bomba. The Herradura\/Jaco bus will take you to Central Jaco, and all the way to Herradura beach for less than it would cost to take a taxi. The price to ride the bus in 2004 was CRC85.\n\nAt the north end of Jaco, across from the Best Western hotel, is the official bus station. If you want to take the bus from Jaco or Herradura to San Jose, this is where you need to go to buy tickets. There is a ticket window where you can purchase tickets, and it's recommended that you do so. Seats are assigned, but the Costa Ricans have no qualms about over-selling the bus. The trip from Jaco to San Jose generally takes 3-4 hours, and without a seat, you're forced to stand the entire, perilous trip, until someone gets off and there's an empty seat. This rarely happens. At this bus terminal you can also purchase tickets to other destinations such as Puntarenas and Quepos. Bus fare is inexpensive, and bus travel is always sure to be an adventure. If returning to San Jose by bus from Jaco, there are many places throughout Jaco that you can catch the bus: the bus terminal, of course, the bus stop in front of Mas o Menos, or various other locations along the Jaco strip. It's also possible to pick up the San Jose bus on the west side of the road at the crosswalk in Herradura. There are set times when the buses come and go, and for the most part they are usually on time. Be there a little early so you don't miss it. As always, be cautious with your belonging on the bus. There is storage underneath the bus for heavier and larger items, but people have been known to take suitcases  and bags, from under the bus, that did not belong to them. Always keep an eye on your belonging inside the bus as well.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" See "]},"\nJaco is fairly small, and it's easy to see the entire town in one day. But you can also just as easily take your time and spend several days exploring, shopping, going to the beach, surfing, dining out, going to bars, and taking tours in the Jaco area. If you have a rental car, a drive along the Western Costa, along the Costanera is very beautiful, and offers many opportunities to stop, take pictures, or find private, secluded beaches. Manuel Antonio, one of Costa Rica's National Parks, is an hour drive from Jaco, and is nearly a straight shot South along the Costanera highway.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Mono Azul"],["alt=The Blue Monkey"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=S of Jaco on the road to Manual Antonio"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Sloth rescue project, sponsored by Kids Saving the Rainforest."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Do "]},"\nJaco is not very big, but there are plenty of things to do there.

There are lots of surf camps and surf schools in the area, make sure you choose one that is credible and especially certified to guarantee quality. There are also many shops along Jaco's main street that offer surfboard\/boogie board rentals. Lying out on the beach and swimming are nice. The beach is beautiful, however the black sand at midday is scorching hot. There are some fantastic restaurants in Jaco, including some excellent \"sodas\", the local traditional restaurant.
