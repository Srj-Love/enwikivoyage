Jalandhar is well connected by trains, including a Shatabdi train from Delhi to Amritsar via Jalandhar which runs twice a day with air-conditioned chair car coaches. Jammu Mail, among others, runs in the night from Delhi to Jalandhar.\n\nApart from trains, Jalandhar is easy accessible by buses plying from all over the North India. There are many interstate buses connecting Jalandhar to the major towns of Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana, Delhi and Rajasthan. \n\nJalandhar is well connected to all the major cities in Punjab by Public and Private buses. There are private buses connecting Jalandhar to the towns in other states but generally they don't have the legal permits and took much time as compared to state owned buses. However, these can be comfortable as compared to state buses depending upon the bus operator. There are air conditioned buses also which generally have valid permits. \n\nThere is no airport in Jalandhar but the nearest airport is in Amritsar at a distance of 100 km (90 mins). There are many airlines operating from Amritsar airport connecting it to Europe, North Ameica and Middle east. However the transport system connecting Airport to Jalandhar is poor, so it is advisable to book a taxi before you arrive.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Rickshaw (pedicab)"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Auto-rickshaw"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Bus"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["City cab(taxi)"]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Devi Talab Mandir"]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Wonderland"]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Nikku Park"]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Science City"]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Bowling"]}," - Prithvi's Planet"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Water rides"]}," - Wonderland"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Sports goods"]}," - Jalandhar is famous for its sports goods."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Traditional Clothes"]}," - salwar suits, sarees etc. at Sheikhan bazaar."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Punjabi Jutis"]}," (Slippers)"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Jewellery"]}," - For non-branded jewellery, there are lot of local jewellers at Phoolan Waala Chowk.
