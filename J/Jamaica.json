Columbus' probable landing point was Dry Harbour, now called Discovery Bay. St. Ann's Bay was the \"Saint Gloria\" of Columbus who first sighted Jamaica at this point. The Spanish were forcibly evicted by the British at Ocho Rios in St. Ann and in 1655 the British took over the last Spanish fort in Jamaica. The Spanish colonists fled leaving a large number of African slaves. Rather than be re-enslaved by the English, they escaped into the hilly, mountainous regions of the island, joining those who had previously escaped from the Spanish to live with the Taínos. These runaway slaves, who became known as the Jamaican Maroons, fought the British during the 18th century. During the long years of slavery Maroons established free communities in the mountainous interior of Jamaica, maintaining their freedom and independence for generations.\n\nDuring its first 200 years of British rule, Jamaica became one of the world's leading sugar-exporting, slave-dependent nations. After the abolition of the slave trade in 1807, the British imported Indian and Chinese workers as indentured servants to supplement the labour pool. Descendants of indentured servants of Indian and Chinese origin continue to reside in Jamaica today.\n\nBy the beginning of the 19th century, Jamaica's heavy reliance on slavery resulted in blacks (Africans) outnumbering whites (Europeans) by a ratio of almost 20 to 1. Even though England had outlawed the importation of slaves, some were still smuggled into the colonies.\n\nIn the 1800s, the British established a number of botanical gardens. These included the Castleton Garden, set up in 1862 to replace the Bath Garden (created in 1779) which was subject to flooding. Bath Garden was the site for planting breadfruit brought to Jamaica from the Pacific by Captain William Bligh. Other gardens were the Cinchona Plantation founded in 1868 and the Hope Garden founded in 1874. In 1872, Kingston became the island's capital.\n\nJamaica slowly gained increasing independence from the United Kingdom and in 1958, it became a province in the Federation of the West Indies before attaining full independence by leaving the federation in 1962. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["People"]},"\nThe majority of Jamaicans are descended at least partially from the many Africans who were enslaved and transported to the island. Jamaica also has sizeable numbers of Whites and Mulattoes, persons of Syrian\/Lebanese descent, and a large population of Chinese and East Indians, many of whom have intermixed throughout the generations. Mixed-race Jamaicans are the second largest racial group after Black Jamaicans. Christianity is the major religion in the island, and the Rasta community, which Jamaica is known for internationally, has also featured prominently in its history. As in other Caribbean areas, West African religion and folk beliefs derived therefrom (locally called Obeah among other terms) are sometimes practiced and taboo in some people's eyes. There is a small but quite longstanding Jewish community and communities of Muslims, Hindus, and others.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nThe climate in Jamaica is tropical, with hot and humid weather, although higher inland regions are more temperate.

When the Spanish came here in 1494, except for small agricultural clearings, the country was deeply forested, but the European settlers cut down the great timber trees for building purposes and cleared the plains, savannahs, and mountain slopes for cultivation. Many new plants were introduced including sugar cane, bananas, and citrus trees. \n\nIn the areas of heavy rainfall are stands of bamboo, ferns, ebony, mahogany, and rosewood. Cactus and similar dry-area plants are found along the south and southwest coastal area. Parts of the west and southwest consist of large grasslands, with scattered stands of trees.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Fauna"]},"\nJamaican animal life is diverse and includes many endemic species found nowhere else on earth. As with other islands, non-human land mammals are made up almost entirely of bats. The only non-bat native mammal extant in Jamaica is the Jamaican hutia, locally known as the coney. Introduced mammals such as wild boar and the small Asian mongoose are also common. Jamaica is also home to many reptiles, the largest of which is the American crocodile (although it is found only in the Black River and a few other areas). Lizards from the colourful ",{"type":"''","value":["Anolis"]}," genus, iguanas and snakes such as racers and the Jamaica boa (the largest snake on the island) are common. None of Jamaica's native snakes is dangerously venomous. Beautiful and exotic birds such as the Jamaican tody and the doctor bird (the national bird) can be found, among a large number of others. Insects and other invertebrates are abundant, including the world's largest centipede, the Amazonian giant centipede, and the homerus swallowtail, the Western Hemisphere's largest butterfly.\n\nJamaican waters contain considerable resources of fresh-and saltwater fish. The chief varieties of saltwater fish are kingfish, jack, mackerel, whiting, bonito, and tuna. Fish that occasionally enter freshwater include snook, jewfish, gray and black snapper, and mullet. Fish that spend the majority of their lives in Jamaica's fresh waters include many species of live-bearers, killifish, freshwater gobies, the mountain mullet, and the American eel.

Roads in and around major cities and towns are generally congested, and rural roads tend to be narrow and somewhat dangerous, especially in inclement weather. Alert and courteous driving is advised at all times. There are very few north-south routes as well, so travel from the north to the south can involve treks on mountain roads. These trips can induce nausea in the more weak of stomach, so it is advisable that if you suffer from motion sickness to bring Dramamine or similar medication.

For towns where traffic lights are not installed, roundabouts are used.\n\nRenting a car is easily done, and it is advised to go through an established major car rental company such as Island Car Rental, Hertz or Avis.

Check with the resort's office that is in charge of planning day trips for more information. Excursions by bus from Ocho Rios to Kingston and Blue mountain, can turn into a long bus ride without many stops. A visit to Kingston  might consist of a stop at a shopping centre for lunch, a visit to Bob Marley's home and a 2 minute stop in the Beverly Hills of Jamaica. The guided tour at the Blue Mountain coffee factory can be interesting and informative.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nLocal taxis (called \"route taxis\") are an interesting way to get around and far cheaper than tourist taxis.  For instance, it may cost JMD50 (less than a dollar) to travel 20 miles.  It will just look like a local's car, which is precisely what it is.  The licensed ones usually have the taxi signs spray painted on their front fenders, although there seems to be little enforcement of things like business licenses in Jamaica.  Seldom you will find one with a taxi sign on the top, because not many do this. The colour of the license plate will tell you. A red plate will tell you that it is for transportation, while a white plate will tell you it is a private vehicle. The yellow plate indicates a government vehicle (like a police car or ambulance) and the list continues. Although the route taxis generally run from the centre of one town to the centre of the next town, you can flag a taxi anywhere along the highway. Walk or stand on the side of the road and wave at passing cars and you'll be surprised how quickly you get one.  \n\nRoute taxis are often packed with people, but they are friendly folk and glad to have you with them.  Route taxis are the primary mode of transportation for Jamaicans and serve the purpose that a bus system would in a large metropolitan city.  This is how people get to work, kids get to school, etc.\n\nRoute taxis generally run between specific places, but if you're in the central taxi hub for a town you'll be able to find taxis going in any of the directions you need to go.  Route taxis don't run very far, so if you need to get half way across the island you'll need to take it in stages.  If worst comes to worst, just keep repeating your final destination to all the people who ask where you're going and they'll put you in the right car and send you on your way.  You may have to wait until the taxi has enough passengers to make the trip worthwhile for the driver, and many route taxis travel with far more people in them than a Westerner would ever guess was possible.  If you have luggage with you, you may have to pay an extra fare for your luggage since you're taking up space that would otherwise be sold to another passenger.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Jamaica Air Shuttle has several daily flights between Kingston Tinson Pen (closer to downtown than the main airport) and Montego Bay for around US$70.

You probably won't get a chance to try this food anywhere else, and if you really want to say that you did something uniquely Jamaican, then this is your chance. Freshly picked and prepared ackee is 100 times better than tinned ackee, but must be harvested only when the ackee fruits have ripened and their pods opened naturally on the large evergreen tree on which they grow: unripe ackee contains a potent toxin (hypoglycin A) which causes vomiting and hypoglycemia . Don't worry. locals are expert at preparing ackee and will know how to pick it safely. \n\nAnother local food is called ",{"type":"'''","value":["bammy"]},", which was actually invented by the Arawak (Taino) Indians. It is a flat floury cassava pancake normally eaten during breakfast hours that kind of tastes like corn bread. There is also hard-dough bread (locally called hard dough bread), which comes in both sliced and unsliced varieties. Try toasting it, for when it is toasted, it tastes better than most bread you'll ever eat. If you are looking for dishes with more meat in them, you can try the jerk flavoured foods. The most popular is ",{"type":"'''","value":["jerk chicken"]},", although jerk pork and jerk conch are also common. The ",{"type":"'''","value":["jerk seasoning"]}," is a spice that is spread on the meat on the grill like barbecue sauce.

The many mango varieties are a 'must have' if you are visiting during the summer months. If you have not tasted the fruit ripened on the tree, then you are missing out. Fruit picked green and exported to other countries does not compare. Try drinking 'coconut water' straight out of the coconut. This is not the same as coconut milk. Coconut water is clear and refreshing, not to mention the fact that it has numerous health benefits. Pawpaws, star apples, guineps, pineapples, jackfruit, oranges, tangerines, ugli fruit, ortaniques are just some of the wonderful varieties of fruit available here. \n\nLocally grown fruits and vegetables are inexpensive.  Visitors may well find that imported produce such as American apples, strawberries, plums etc. tend to be more expensive than in their home country.  Grapes in particular tend to be very expensive on the island.\n\nChinese food is available in many places from Chinese takeaway stores and has a distinct Jamaican taste.\n\nIt is recommended to sample the local fruit and vegetables.  If unfamiliar with a particular fruit it can pay to ask a local about which parts can be eaten.  Local and imported fruits are available from road-side vendors.

Since the turn of the century, the majority of soft drinks are bottled in plastic instead of glass. You can try the local lager called Red Stripe (which is exported to many countries in the west, so there is a good chance you have already tasted it) and Dragon Stout.

In an effort, as they say, to balance the budget [which the People National Party (P.N.P) has been trying to do some 16 years now] a prominent member of the party describe this as been the most massive transfer of resources from the poor to the rich that has ever occurred in this country since the abolishment of slavery. A whole lot of people who should be gainfully employed in the work force are not as a result of government policies. The garment industry for example has seen a sharp decline over the years due to soaring interest rates. so now banks make money, not by lending money to potential investors, but by buying government paper so the unemployment in the country is as a direct result of government policies.  Agriculture, manufacturing, and various other sectors are in a shambles causing many workers to find alternatives.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]}," \nJamaica has the ",{"type":"'''","value":["5th highest murder rate in the world"]},". As in any other country, should any emergency situation arise, after calling 119 for the police or 110 for the fire brigade or ambulance, you might want to contact your government's embassy or consulate. Governments usually advise travellers staying in Jamaica for an extended period of time to notify their embassy or consulate so they can be contacted in the case of emergency.\n\nIf you are approached by a Jamaican looking to sell you drugs or anything else that you are not interested in buying, the conversation will most likely go like this: \"Is this your first time on The Island?\" Respond: \"No, I've been here many times before\" (even if it is not true or as he will less likely  think you are gullible). Next, they will ask \"Where are you staying?\" Respond with a vague answer: for instance, if you are approached on Seven Mile Beach, respond by saying \"Down the street\". If asked \"Which resort?\", respond with another vague answer. They will see that you are not stupid nor ready to be taken advantage of. They will appear to be engaging in friendly conversation, but once you are marked a sucker (like \"It's my first time here\" \"I'm staying at Negril Gardens\"), you will be harassed. If you are further pushed to buy drugs or something else, calmly tell them: \"I've been to this island many times before: please don't waste your time trying to sell me something. I'm not interested.\" They should leave you alone, they may even say \"Respect,\" and pound your fist.\n\nThe cultural and legal abhorrence against ",{"type":"'''","value":["homosexuals"]}," (battymen) in Jamaica is far-reaching, and not only from a legal perspective, from which anal sex may be punished with up to 10 years. However, heterosexual anal sex is gaining in popularity, and while technically illegal, it has never been prosecuted by the state. It is advisable to avoid displaying affection to people of the same sex in public, especially between two men - Jamaica is a nation notorious for its persistent intolerance of homosexual behaviour, gay bashings are not uncommon (particularly in popular reggae and dancehall music in Jamaica) and victims would be met with indifference by the authorities. Lesbians are more widely accepted by younger Jamaicans, and it is not unusual to see lesbians openly enjoying the 'sights' from the front row at one of Kingston's strip clubs. Simply put, Jamaica is not a suitable destination for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["LGBT tourism"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Marijuana"]},", (locally known as ",{"type":"'''","value":["ganja"]},") although cheap, plentiful and powerful, ",{"type":"'''","value":["is illegal"]},"  on the island.

",{"type":"'''","value":["Jamaican prisons are very basic and places you would want to avoid at all costs."]},"\n\nIf in need of police, dial ",{"type":"'''","value":["119"]},", just don't expect them to show up on the spot.\n\nDrugs and alcohol are prevalent. Armed men may pose a threat to women in some areas. Inner-city parts of the island such as Spanish Town and some neighbourhoods in Kingston (Trench Town, etc.) should be avoided even during the day. However, those who are interested in visiting the Culture Yard in Trench Town should be safe if they go during daylight hours and with a hired local guide, which should not be terribly expensive. Be sure to ask for advice from locals before going, and avoid going there around elections, when violence flares up. \n\nSeptember, October, and November have a lower number of tourists due to being hurricane season. As a result, the police are encouraged to take their vacation during this time. This reduction in the police force can cause areas like Montego Bay's hip strip to be less safe than they normally are.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]}," \n",{"type":"'''","value":["Medical facilities"]}," on the island are not always up to par with European or American health care standards. Falling ill can sometimes result in major medical fees. Therefore, buy ",{"type":"'''","value":["travel insurance"]},", as this will ensure peace of mind in emergency situations.\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["tap water"]}," is generally good and safe to drink. All piped water in Jamaica is treated to international standards, and will be of the same quality you could expect to find in North America or Europe. Water service in rural areas can sometimes go out for several hours at a time. People in rural areas have their own water tanks, which catch water when it rains, so be ready to draw from a tank instead of turning a pipe. Water from these sources should be boiled before being consumed. Bottled water such as Wata (a local brand), Aquafina and Deer Park are widely available.\n\nBe cautious of the water quality at public swimming beaches, such as \"Walter Fletcher Beach\" in Montego Bay, which some locals call \"dump-up beach\", situated near the north gully.  Large amounts of solid and human waste flush down the gully during storm events.  The water flowing down Dunn's River Falls has also been said to contain high amounts of coliform bacteria, indicating faecal contamination.\n\nThe country's adult HIV\/AIDS prevalence is nearly at ",{"type":"'''","value":["1.6%"]},". This is ",{"type":"'''","value":[">2.5"]}," times higher than the USA and ",{"type":"'''","value":["16"]}," times higher than the UK. So while Jamaica has a relatively low infection rate compared to some other developing nations, you would be wise to abstain or practice safe sex and avoid risky intravenous drug use.\n\nA 2006 ",{"type":"[[","value":[["malaria"]]}," outbreak in Kingston was identified and controlled and Jamaica has now returned to the malaria free status it had for decades before this localised and isolated incident.\n\nAs in much of the Caribbean, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["dengue fever"]]}," is an increasing risk. This normally manifests as a flu-like illness with severe joint and muscle pain, vomiting and a rash which may be complicated by haemorrhagic shock. It's transmitted by ",{"type":"''","value":["Aedes"]}," mosquitoes, which bite in the daytime and love densely populated areas like Kingston, though they also inhabit rural environments. No vaccine or other prophylactics are available so use insect repellent if you can not stand to be covered head to toe in the tropical humid heat.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Respect"]}," \nMany Jamaican people are very generous and warm. Returning this warmth and friendliness is a great way to show them you appreciate their country.\n\nChances are, you will be approached at one point or another during your travels in Jamaica for money. Do not feel pressured into giving money.  A strong \"I'm alright\" and walking away is usually the best advice for instances such as this. This also applies in the infamous ",{"type":"'''","value":["straw markets"]},". The European method of just walking away does not work well. You will generally need to engage with someone in order to get away from them.\n\nThat being said, if you befriend or encounter one of the many wonderful Jamaican people and you wish to give a friendly gift, that is perfectly acceptable and welcome. Just exercise common sense when it comes to money. \n\nCultural respect is far more important. You are guests on their island. Please know also that when speaking to the elderly you should say, \"Yes ma'am.\" or \"Yes, sir\". \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Phone"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Internet"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Post"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Newspapers"]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Caribbean"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Geo"],["18.18"],["-77.32"],["zoom=9"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Jamaica"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Caribbean\/Jamaica\/"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecountry"]]}]
