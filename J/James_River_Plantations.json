An unparalleled collection of historic plantations still overlook the tidal portion of the river, below the falls in Richmond. Thirty-three of those plantations listed in the National Register of Historic Places are located along the James River and its tributaries. They are architectural treasures, ranging from diminutive Piney Grove, which began as a log corncrib c. 1790, to grand brick homes like Bacon's Castle, representative of Virginia plantation life in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Goochland County"]},"  \n",{"type":"*","value":["Tuckahoe    "]},{"type":"===","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Richmond (Virginia)"],["Richmond"]]}]},"    \n",{"type":"*","value":["Wilton      "]},{"type":"===","value":["Chesterfield County"]},"    \n",{"type":"*","value":["Castlewood    "]},{"type":"*","value":["Magnolia Grange    "]},{"type":"*","value":["Eppington      "]},{"type":"===","value":["Dinwiddie County"]},"    \n",{"type":"*","value":["Mayfield Cottage    "]},"    \n",{"type":"===","value":["Petersburg"]},"  \n",{"type":"*","value":["Battersea    "]},"    \n",{"type":"===","value":["Colonial Heights"]},"    \n",{"type":"*","value":["Violet Bank      "]},{"type":"===","value":["Hopewell"]},"   \n",{"type":"*","value":["Weston Manor    "]},{"type":"*","value":["Appomattox Manor "]},{"type":"===","value":["Charles City County"]},"   \n",{"type":"*","value":["Shirley    "]},{"type":"*","value":["Edgewood  "]},{"type":"*","value":["Berkeley    "]},{"type":"*","value":["Westover    "]},{"type":"*","value":["Belle Air    "]},{"type":"*","value":["North Bend"]},{"type":"*","value":["Upper Weyanoke  "]},{"type":"*","value":["Kittiewan"]},{"type":"*","value":["John Tyler House (Sherwood Forest)"]},{"type":"*","value":["iney Grove"]},{"type":"===","value":["James City County"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Powhatan"]},{"type":"*","value":["Kingsmill Plantation"]},{"type":"*","value":["Carter's Grove"]},{"type":"===","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Newport News"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Lee Hall"]},{"type":"*","value":["Richneck Plantation Site  "]},{"type":"*","value":["Denbigh Plantation Site (Mathews Manor)"]},{"type":"*","value":["Matthew Jones House"]},{"type":"===","value":["Isle of Wight County"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Four Square"]},{"type":"===","value":["Surry County"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Bacon's Castle"]},{"type":"*","value":["Chippokes Plantation"]},{"type":"*","value":["Warren House (Smith's Fort)"]},{"type":"===","value":["Prince George County  "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Brandon"]},{"type":"*","value":["Flowerdew Hundred Plantation"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Lodging"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Camping"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Backcountry"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinepark"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Virginia"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["no Wikipedia link"]]}]
