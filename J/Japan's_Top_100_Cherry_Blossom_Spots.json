The concept came from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China"]]}," where plum blossoms were the flower of choice. In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were hosted by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court. From the Heian Period, references to the blossoms and the hanami parties made their way into poetry and paintings, solidifying their position as an integral part of Japanese culture. They are often used as metaphors for life, as they are so beautiful when they bloom but fade and die away so quickly.\n\nToyotomi Hideyoshi was particularly fond of cherry blossoms and hanami parties. The parties he held at Daigo-ji in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kyoto\/South"],["Southern Kyoto"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yoshino"],["Mount Yoshino"]]}," are well-known to this day. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mount Yoshino"]}," is indisputably the best place in the nation for cherry-blossom viewing with over 30,000 trees. Most of those trees were planted during the Nara Period by priests as a part of religious ascetics associated with mountain worship. None of the trees are said to have existed here naturally. Toyotomi Hideyoshi made the mountain famous through his many grand hanami parties. It is said that he had over 5,000 guests at his Mount Yoshino party in 1594. At ",{"type":"'''","value":["Daigo-ji"]},", he did his own landscaping, specifically to add hundreds of cherry blossoms and the Sanbo-in Garden for the purpose of hosting one of his parties in 1598. It was a massive event, said to be the biggest flower-viewing event in history.\n\nWhile the official parties were still limited to the court, samurai later began hosting parties of their own. In time, ordinary citizens made trips in the spring to see the cherry trees. Actual parties among the masses however, did not truly become a part of Japanese culture until the Edo Period.\n\nSince then, cherry blossoms have become a symbol of the nation of Japan. They remain highly regarded with many websites dedicated to highlighting places to see them, festivals, and even making predictions of when they will bloom in each region, since the actual blooming days vary each year depending on the winter weather. Today, the cherry blossom-viewing tradition remains strong and has even spread to other countries where Japan has donated trees.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["The List"]},"\nAlthough the list itself acts as a ranking system, within the list, no hierarchy is given. The numbers simply mark the position of the location in Japan from Hokkaido (Sakura Namiki Street) in the north to Okinawa (Nago Castle Park) in the south.
