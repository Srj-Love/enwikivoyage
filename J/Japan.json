Japanese culture stretches back millennia, yet has also adopted (and created) the latest modern fashions and trends.\n\nJapan is a study in contrasts and contradictions. Many Japanese corporations dominate their industries, yet if you read the financial news it seems like Japan is practically bankrupt. Cities are as modern and high tech as anywhere else, but tumbledown wooden shacks can still be spotted next to glass fronted designer condominiums. On an average subway ride, you might see childishly cute character toys and incredibly violent pornography — sometimes enjoyed by the same passenger, at the same time! Japan has beautiful temples and gardens which are often surrounded by garish signs and ugly buildings. In the middle of a modern skyscraper you might discover a sliding wooden door which leads to a traditional chamber with tatami mats, calligraphy, and tea ceremony. These juxtapositions mean you may often be surprised and rarely bored by your travels in Japan.\n\nAlthough Japan has often been seen in the West as a land combining tradition and modernity, and juxtapositions definitely exist, part of this idea is obsolete, and is a product of Japan being the first major Asian power to modernize as well as Western patronization and heavy promotion by the travel industry. Keep in mind that continued demolition of some of Japan's historic landmarks goes on apace, as with the famed Kabuki-za Theater demolition. Still, with the proper planning, and with expectations held in check, a trip to Japan can be incredibly enjoyable and definitely worthwhile.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nJapan's location on islands at the outermost edge of Asia has had a profound influence on its history. Just close enough to mainland Asia, yet far enough to keep itself separate, much of Japanese history has seen alternating periods of closure and openness. Until recently, Japan has been able to turn on or off its connection to the rest of the world, accepting foreign cultural influences in fits and starts. It is comparable with the relationship between Britain and the rest of Europe, but with a much wider channel.\n\nRecorded Japanese history begins in the 5th century, although archaeological evidence of settlement stretches back 50,000 years and the mythical Emperor Jimmu is said to have founded the current Imperial line in the 7th century BC. Archeological evidence, however, has only managed to trace the Imperial line back to the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Kofun Period"]}," (古墳時代) during the 3rd to 7th centuries AD, which was also when the Japanese first had significant contact with China and Korea. Japan then gradually became a centralized state during the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Asuka Period"]}," (飛鳥時代), during which Japan extensively absorbed many aspects of Chinese culture, and saw the introduction of Mahayana Buddhism and Confucianism. The popular board game of Go is also believed to have been introduced to Japan during this period.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Kamakura Daibutsu JIM9943-vi.jpg"],["thumb"],["The Great Buddha of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kamakura"]]}]]},"\n\nThe first strong Japanese state was centered in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nara"]]},", which was built to model the then Chinese capital Chang'an.

Although the emperor continued to rule in name from the imperial capital in Kyoto, in practice absolute power was concentrated in the hands of the Tokugawa shogun. A strict caste system was imposed, with the Shogun and his ",{"type":"''","value":["samurai"]}," warriors at the top of the heap and no social mobility permitted.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:AtomicEffects-p42a.jpg"],["thumb"],["Nuclear devastation in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hiroshima"]]}," (1945)"]]},"\n\nDuring this period, dubbed the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Edo Period"]}," (江戸時代), Tokugawa rule kept the country stable but stagnant with a policy of almost total isolation (with the exception of Dutch and Chinese merchants in certain designated cities) while the world around them rushed ahead. US Commodore Matthew Perry's Black Ships arrived in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yokohama"]]}," in 1854, forcing the country to open up to trade with the West, resulting in the signing of unequal treaties and the collapse of the shogunate in the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Meiji Restoration"]}," (明治維新) of 1867, during which the imperial capital was relocated from Kyoto to Edo, now renamed Tokyo. After observing Western colonization in Southeast Asia and the division and weakening of China, which the Japanese had for so long considered to be the world's greatest superpower, Japan vowed not to be overtaken by the West, launching itself headlong into a drive to industrialize and modernize at frantic speed.  Adopting Western technology and culture wholesale, Japan's cities soon sprouted railways, brick buildings and factories, and even the disastrous Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923, which flattened large parts of Tokyo and killed over 100,000 people, was barely a bump in the road.\n\nFrom day one, resource-poor Japan had looked elsewhere for the supplies it needed, and this soon turned into a drive to ",{"type":"'''","value":["expand and colonize"]}," its neighbors.  The Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95 saw Japan take control of Taiwan, Korea and parts of Manchuria, and its victory against Russia in the 1904–5 Russo-Japanese war cemented its position of strength.  With an increasingly totalitarian government controlled by the military, Japan launched a full-scale invasion of China via Manchuria in 1931 and by 1941 had an empire stretching across much of Asia and the Pacific.  In 1941, Japan attacked ",{"type":"'''","value":["Pearl Harbor"]},", destroying a small portion of the U.S. Pacific fleet but drawing America into the war, whose tide soon started to turn against Japan.

The Emperor kept his throne but was turned into a constitutional monarch. Thus converted to pacifism and democracy, with the US taking care of defense, Japan now directed its prodigious energies into peaceful technology and reemerged from poverty to conquer the world's marketplaces with an endless stream of cars and consumer electronics to attain the second-largest gross national product in the world after the United States.\n\nBut frenzied growth could not last forever, and after the Nikkei stock index hit the giddy heights of 39,000 in 1989, the bubble well and truly burst, leading to Japan's ",{"type":"'''","value":["lost decade"]}," of the 1990s that saw the real estate bubbles deflate, the stock market fall by half and, adding insult to injury, the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Great Hanshin Earthquake"]}," of 1995 that leveled parts of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kobe"]]}," and killed over 6,000 people. The economy has yet to fully recover from its doldrums, with deflation driving down prices, an increasingly unsupportable burden of government debt (nearing 200% of GDP) and an increasing polarization of Japanese society into \"haves\" with permanent jobs and \"have-not\" ",{"type":"''","value":["freeters"]}," drifting between temporary jobs. National anxiety has also increased due to neighboring ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China"]]},"'s more assertive regional stance as well overtaking Japan to become the world's second largest economy.

Almost 99% of the population is of Japanese ethnicity. The largest minority are Koreans, around 1 million strong, many in their 3rd or 4th generations.

Many Japanese are thrilled to have visitors to their country and are incredibly helpful to lost and bewildered-looking foreigners. Younger Japanese people are often extremely interested in meeting and becoming friends with foreigners as well. Do not be surprised if a Japanese person (usually of the opposite gender) approaches you in a public place and tries to initiate a conversation with you in somewhat coherent English. On the other hand, many are not used to dealing with foreigners (外人 ",{"type":"''","value":["gaijin"]},", or the more politically correct 外国人 ",{"type":"''","value":["gaikokujin"]},") and are more reserved and reluctant to communicate. \n\nVisibly foreign visitors remain a rarity in many parts of Japan outside of major cities, and you will likely encounter moments when entering a shop causes the staff to seemingly panic and scurry off into the back. Don't take this as racism or other xenophobia: they're just afraid that you'll try to address them in English and they'll be embarrassed because they can't understand or reply. A smile and a ",{"type":"''","value":["Konnichiwa"]}," (\"Hello\") often helps.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Culture"]},"\n\nJapan has gone through periods of openness and isolation during its history, therefore its culture is if anything unique. Having been in the Chinese cultural sphere for much of its history, substantial Chinese influences can be seen in Japanese culture, and these have been seamlessly blended with native Japanese customs to give rise to a culture that is distinctly Japanese. \n\nDuring the Edo period, Japanese culture had been strongly influenced by Confucianism. The Tokugawa Shogunate instituted a rigid class system, with the Shogun at the apex, his retainers below him, and the other samurai below that, followed by a vast population of commoners at the bottom. Commoners were expected to pay respect to samurai (at the risk of being killed if they didn't), and women were expected to be subservient to men. Samurai were expected to a adopt a \"Death before dishonour\" attitude, and would typically commit suicide by self disembowlment (切腹 ",{"type":"''","value":["seppuku"]},") rather than live in shame. Although the Edo period ended with the Meiji Restoration in 1868, its legacy still lives on in Japanese society. Honour still remains an important concept in Japanese society, employees are still expected to be unquestioningly obedient to their bosses, and women continue to struggle for equal treatment.\n\nJapanese people are fiercely proud of their heritage and culture, and hold on to many ancient traditions that go back hundreds of years. At the same time, they also seem to be obsessed with the latest technology, and consumer technology in Japan is often several years ahead of the rest of the world. This paradox of being traditional, yet ultramodern often serves to intrigue visitors, and many keep returning to Japan to experience this after their first visit.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Holidays"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Tokyo matsuri geisha.jpg"],["thumb"],["A geisha at a festival procession in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tokyo"]]}]]},"\nThe most important holiday in Japan is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["New Year"]}," (お正月 ",{"type":"''","value":["Oshōgatsu"]},"), which pretty much shuts down the country from December 30 to January 3. Japanese head home to their families (which means massive transport congestion), eat festive foods and head out to the neighborhood temple at the stroke of midnight to wish in the New Year. Many Japanese often travel to other countries as well, and prices for airfares are very high.\n\nIn March or April, Japanese head out en masse for ",{"type":"''","value":["hanami"]}," (花見, lit. \"flower viewing\"), a festival of outdoors picnics and drunken revelry in parks, cleverly disguised as ",{"type":"'''","value":["cherry blossom"]}," (桜 ",{"type":"''","value":["sakura"]},") viewing. The exact timing of the famously fleeting blossoms varies from year to year and Japan's TV channels follow the progress of the cherry blossom front from south to north obsessively.\n\nJapan's longest holiday is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Golden Week"]}," (April 27 to May 6), when there are four public holidays within a week and people go on an extended vacation. Trains become crowded and flight and hotel prices are jacked up to multiples of normal prices, making this a bad time to travel in Japan, but the weeks immediately before or after Golden Week are excellent choices.\n\nSummer brings a spate of festivals designed to distract people from the intolerable heat and humidity (comparable to the US Midwest).

Keep in mind that most Japanese people take additional time off around New Year's, during Golden Week, and during Obon. The most important festival is New Year's Day, and many shops and restaurants close for at least 2 days during this period, so it might not be an ideal time to visit.

",{"type":"'''","value":["Christianity"]},", introduced by European missionaries, was widely persecuted during the feudal era but is now accepted, and a small percentage of Japanese are Christian.\n\nGenerally speaking, the Japanese are not a particularly religious people. While they regularly visit shrines and temples to offer coins and make silent prayers, religious faith and doctrine play a small role (if any) in the life of the average Japanese. Thus it would be impossible to try to represent what percentage of the population is Shinto versus Buddhist, or even Christian. According to a famous poll, Japan is 80% Shinto ",{"type":"''","value":["and"]}," 80% Buddhist, and another oft-quoted dictum states that Japanese are Shinto when they live, as weddings and festivals are typically Shinto, but Buddhist when they die, since funerals usually use Buddhist rites. Most Japanese accept a little bit of every religion. Christianity is evident almost exclusively in a commercial sense. In season, variations of Santa Claus, Christmas trees and other non-religious Christmas symbols are on display in malls and shopping centers throughout metropolitan areas.\n\nAt the same time, Shinto and Buddhism have had an enormous influence on the country's history and cultural life. The Shinto religion focuses on the spirit of the land, and is reflected in the country's exquisite gardens and peaceful shrines deep in ancient forests. When you visit a shrine (",{"type":"''","value":["jinja"]}," 神社) with its simple ",{"type":"''","value":["torii"]}," (鳥居) gate, you are seeing Shinto customs and styles. If you see an empty plot of land with some white paper suspended in a square, that's a Shinto ceremony to dedicate the land for a new building. Buddhism in Japan has branched out in numerous directions over the centuries. Nichiren (日蓮) is currently the largest branch of Buddhist belief. Westerners are probably most familiar with Zen (禅) Buddhism, which was introduced to Japan in the 14th and 15th centuries. Zen fit the aesthetic and moral sensibilities of medieval Japan, influencing arts such as flower-arranging (生け花 ",{"type":"''","value":["ikebana"]},"), tea ceremony (茶道 ",{"type":"''","value":["sadō"]},"), ceramics, painting, calligraphy, poetry, and the martial arts. Over the years, Shinto and Buddhism have intertwined considerably. You will find them side by side in cities, towns, and people's lives.

(Legally you can only trade the balls for prizes, but gamblers always opt for \"special prize\" tokens which they exchange for cash at a separate booth elsewhere in the building or in a nearby alley.

The rules in Japanese baseball are not much different than baseball in United States, although there are some minor variations.

Sumo has retained many traditions from its Shinto origins, and a single bout usually consists of many minutes of rituals and mental preparation, followed by just 10-30 seconds of wrestling. Sumo wrestlers live a regimented life in training stables, devoting themselves to nothing more than bulking up and competing. A few foreign wrestlers have been quite successful in the top ranks, although new rules have put a limit on how many foreign wrestlers each stable may train.\n\nThese days, TV animation, or ",{"type":"'''''","value":["anime"]},", is also popular in Japan especially with nerds known as ",{"type":"''","value":["otaku"]},".

But if you're travelling longer-distance and don't have a JR pass, or are just passing through and don't want a local smart card, then buying a ticket can get more complicated.\n\nAt major stations there will be an obvious travel section where you can buy your ticket from a human being (look for the little green sign of a figure relaxing in a chair or ask for the ",{"type":"''","value":["midori no madoguchi"]}," みどりの窓口, literally \"green window\").

Generally speaking you can make your desires known by means of hand waving and pointing at destinations if the staff are unable to speak English. Writing down information helps as most Japanese have a much easier time reading English than hearing it.  \n\nOn the other hand if you are at a local station (or a subway station) you will have more difficulty as you nearly always have to buy it using a machine whose instructions are in Japanese (although newer machines have an English mode). ",{"type":"'''","value":["Most of these machines do not take credit cards"]}," although many JR East long-distance ticket machines do. Fortunately this is exactly the place where looking utterly bewildered is liable to lead to some nice Japanese offering to help. If they do then you are in luck, if not then here are some hints. \n\nFirstly, there is usually a big map above all the machines that shows the current station in red, often marked with \"当駅\" (",{"type":"''","value":["tōeki"]},"). Around it will be all other stations you can get to with a price below them. The nearer stations have the smaller numbers (e.g. the closest stations will probably be about ¥140, more distant ones rising to perhaps ¥2,000.\n\nIf you recognize the characters of the station you want to get to, make a note of the amount you should pay and place that amount (or more) into the machine using coins or notes (most machines take ¥1,000 notes, some also take ¥5000 and ¥10000 notes) the price you want will show up as one of the buttons to press. Note that some machines have large black buttons with nothing written on them. These are for different fare levels. Press the buttons until your fare level shows up, insert the money, and take your ticket.\n\nIf you cannot figure out the price, buy a minimum fare ticket and pay when you arrive at your destination. You can either present your ticket to the staff at the gate, or pay the balance at the \"Fare Adjustment\" machine. Look for a small ticket vending kiosk near the exit, but still inside the gate. Insert your minimum fare ticket and pay the balance indicated on the screen.\n\nFor express trains that require a surcharge and seating reservation, you will usually be able to find a staffed window. However, some trains have their own specific machines to do this. First, buy a regular train ticket to your destination. On the touchscreen machines, there will usually be a button for express services. Choose the name of the service you wish to travel on, your destination, preferred departure time and seating preferences, and then insert the surcharge amount. You will be issued a reservation card showing the departure time and your seat number. You ",{"type":"''","value":["must"]}," also have either a travel ticket, pass or smartcard to get through the ticket gates: a surcharge on its own is not valid for travel.\n\nAt bigger stations, you will probably have the choice of more than one train line, or more than one company operating the lines. Therefore, always first find the line you want to use, and then get your ticket from the nearest machine, instead of jumping on the first ticket machine next to the station's entrance. Otherwise you might end up with a ticket for a different company and\/or line. While you can usually choose your platform after going through the gate, and thereby activating your ticket, at smaller stations this might not be the case. If you notice later that you need to get to another platform, you might not be able to get out anymore without invalidating your ticket. So always have a good look at the signposts at every station.\n\n",{"type":"=====","value":["Train types"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Shinkansen schedule display at Tokyo station crop.png"],["thumb"],["upright=1.8"],["An announcement board for Shinkansen trains, displayed in Japanese and English."]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Shinkansen C0892.jpg"],["right"],["thumb"],["A 700-series shinkansen train entering ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Himeji"]]}," station."]]},"\n\nJR pioneered the famous ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bullet Train"]},", known in Japanese as ",{"type":"''","value":["Shinkansen"]}," (新幹線), and with speeds nudging 300 kilometers per hour (360 km\/h in the near future), these remain the fastest way to travel around the country.

These days, however, with ageing train equipment and other modes of transportation becoming easier and sometimes cheaper (e.g. Shinkansen trains and overnight buses), overnight trains have slowly been discontinued.\n\nAs of 2014, only these regularly-scheduled overnight train services remain:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cassiopeia"]}," deluxe sleeper, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tokyo"]]}," - ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hakodate"]]}," - ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sapporo"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hokutosei"]},", Tokyo - Hakodate - Sapporo"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Sunrise Seto"]}," deluxe sleeper, Tokyo - ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Okayama"]]}," - ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Takamatsu"]]}," (during the high season, continuing to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Matsuyama"]]},")"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Sunrise Izumo"]}," deluxe sleeper, Tokyo - Okayama - ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kurashiki"]]}," - ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Izumo"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Twilight Express"]}," deluxe sleeper, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Osaka"]]}," - ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kyoto"]]}," - Sapporo"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hamanasu"]},", Aomori - Sapporo (Technically not a ",{"type":"''","value":["shindai"]}," train but operates overnight)"]},"\nFor most of these services, three separate fares will have to be paid: The basic fare and limited express fare, which are both based on distance, and the accommodation charge, which is fixed over the entire journey. Lodging ranges from carpet spaces - where you literally sleep on the floor - to bunk bed-type compartments, to private rooms with a shower and toilet. The Japan Rail Pass will cover only the basic fare: if you sleep in a bunk bed or a private room, then the limited express and room fares will have to be paid. A few trains have seats or carpet spaces that are fully covered by the Rail Pass. On some trips that run over non-JR tracks, the basic and limited express fares for that portion of the trip will also have to be paid.\n\nSome additional overnight services are added during periods of high demand, such as Golden Week, New Year's and the summer months. Among these is the very popular ",{"type":"'''","value":["Moonlight Nagara"]}," service between Tokyo and Ogaki (located between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nagoya"]]}," and Kyoto).

As such, these trains can be used with the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Seishun 18 Ticket"]]}]}," - and tend to get crowded when they run.\n\nThere are a few drawbacks to overnight train travel. In most cases you cannot book the train until you arrive in Japan, by which point the train might be sold out (unless a helpful Japanese resident purchases the tickets for you in advance of your arrival). Some overnight trains are also subject to cancellation on the day of departure if inclement weather is expected along the route. For example, trains running along the Sea of Japan, including the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Twilight Express"]},", are the most prone to cancellation if heavy snow or high winds are in the forecast.\n\nThe alternative to travelling overnight by train is to travel by bus (see below) - but if you have a Japan Rail Pass, there is another way that you can go about travelling by night - and it can be relatively easy. The key is to split up your journey, stopping at an intermediate station en route to your destination and resting at a nearby (and preferably cheap) hotel. In the morning, take another train toward your destination to complete the trip. The Rail Pass will cover your train journey: your only responsibility is paying for the hotel room. If you can find accommodations in a smaller city, the chances are good that you will pay less for it compared to lodging in bigger cities such as Tokyo... not to mention you will have your own bed, bathroom and toilet.

The card can be obtained from any JAL or ANA ticket counter with a passport-sized photo and a one-time fee of ¥1000\n\nIf you do wish to go on a domestic flight in Japan (e.g. Tokyo to Osaka), don't be surprised if a Boeing 747 jumbo is used for the short 50 minute flight that you are booked on.

Hovercrafts and jet ferries are fast but expensive, with prices varying between ¥2000-5000 for an hour-long trip. Slow cargo boats are more affordable, a rule of thumb being ¥1000 per hour in second class, but departures are infrequent. There are also some inexpensive and convenient short-distance intercity ferries such as the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Aomori"]]},"-",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hakodate"]]}," ferry.\n\nThese boats are typically divided into classes, where second class (２等 ",{"type":"''","value":["nitō"]},") is just a giant expanse of tatami mat, first class (１等 ",{"type":"''","value":["ittō"]},") gets you a comfy chair in large shared room and only special class (特等 ",{"type":"''","value":["tokutō"]},") gets you a private cabin.

Expect to pay around ¥10000 for such a seat on an overnight service between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tokyo"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kansai"]]},".\n\nLike their railroad counterparts, a few overnight buses can be used only by women (an example is the ",{"type":"''","value":["Ladies Dream Osaka"]}," bus service between Tokyo and Osaka).\n\n",{"type":"=====","value":["Japan Bus Pass"]},"\n\nBus operator Willer Express offers a ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/willerexpress.com\/x\/bus\/dynamic\/3\/en\/html\/pc\/buspass\/ Japan Bus Pass"]}]}," for travel on their network of highway buses. It is available to both Japanese and foreigners, but must be purchased outside of Japan. The cost of a Bus Pass is ¥10000 for 3 days or ¥15000 for 5 days. Travel days are non-consecutive but passes must be used up within two months. You are limited to a maximum of two bus trips per day and you cannot travel twice on one route in the same day. Passes are not transferrable and photo identification is required when boarding the buses.\n\nIf you have a lot of time on your hands, want to visit several major cities in a single trip, and do not mind the time spent on buses (including sleeping), then the Bus Pass is worth considering. The more trips you take, the more cost-effective the pass will be. You can potentially ride Willer Express buses for as little as ",{"type":"'''","value":["¥1400-1600"]}," per trip.\n\nThere are a couple of small drawbacks to using the Bus Pass: You are restricted to using buses that seat four to a row, as opposed to three (see above). You also cannot use the Bus Pass during Japan's major holidays (New Year's, Golden Week, Obon) and certain other weekends, unlike train passes (Japan Rail Pass), which have no blackout dates.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Local buses"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Kyoto City Bus 200 Ka 1519.jpg"],["300px"],["thumb"],["Local buses make up most of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kyoto"]]},"'s public transit system."]]},"\nYou won't need to use ",{"type":"'''","value":["local buses"]}," (路線バス ",{"type":"''","value":["rosen basu"]},") much in the major cities, but they're common in smaller towns and the idiosyncratic payment system is worth a mention. On most buses, you're expected to board from the back and grab a little numbered slip as you enter, often just a white piece of paper automatically stamped by the dispenser as you pull it. In the front of the bus, above the driver, is an electronic board displaying numbers and prices below, which march inexorably higher as the bus moves on. When it's time to get off, you press the stop button, match your numbered slip to the electronic board's current price, deposit the slip and corresponding payment in the fare machine next to the driver, then exit through the front door. Note that you must pay the exact fare: to facilitate this, the machine nearly always has bill exchanger built in, which will eat ¥1,000 bills and spew out ¥1,000 worth of coins in exchange. If you're short on change, it's best to exchange ",{"type":"''","value":["before"]}," it's time to get off.\n\nIncreasingly, buses accept smartcards such as PASMO and Suica - you will need to tap your card against a scanner by the entrance (usually above the ticket dispenser) and then again using the scanner next to the fare machine by the driver when you exit. If you fail to 'tap on' when boarding, you will be charged the maximum fare when alighting.\n\nThe electronic board almost always includes a display and recorded voice announcements of the next stop — usually only in Japanese, although some cities (like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kyoto"]]},") make a welcome exception. However, if asked most drivers will be glad to tell you when you've reached your destination.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\n\nYou will find taxis everywhere in Japan, not only in the city but also in the country. Taxis are clean and completely safe, though a bit expensive: starting fees are usually in the ¥640-710 range and the meter ticks up frantically after the first 2 km or so. But sometimes, they are the only way to get where you are going. Taxi meters are strictly regulated and clearly visible to the passenger. If you are not sure if you have enough money for the trip, your driver may be able to guess the approximate cost of a trip beforehand. Even if money is not a concern, if you get a cost estimate beforehand, some taxi drivers will stop the meter at the estimated price regardless of how much further the destination may be, which can save you money. Although it is quite nice when it happens, do not expect this treatment from every taxi driver. Taxi fares are also higher at night. Tipping is not customary and would most likely be refused.\n\nIn the city, you can hail a taxi just about anywhere, but outside train stations and other transfer points you should board at a taxi stand. (The taxi stand will usually either have a long line of patient passengers, or a long line of idle taxis.) If the destination is a well-known location, such as a hotel, train station, or public facility, the name alone should be enough. Note that even in the major cities, you are very unlikely to encounter a taxi driver who can speak English, so carrying a pamphlet or card of your hotel or destination with the address on it can be very helpful. Likewise, have staff at your hotel write down the names and addresses of places you want to visit in Japanese to show your taxi driver.\n\nAn interesting feature of Japanese taxis is that the driver controls the opening and closing of the rear left passenger door. Try to avoid the habit of closing your door when you board the taxi. Taxi drivers also have a reputation for speeding and aggressive driving, but there are very few accidents involving bad drivers.\n\nAll licensed taxis in Japan have green license plates. Unlicensed cabs will have standard white or yellow plates and should be avoided.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n",{"type":"<","value":["div",{"style":"float: right;"},[{"type":"<","value":["gallery",{"perrow":"3","heights":"50px","width":"275px","widths":"50px"},["\nFile:Japanese Road sign (Crossroads).svg|Crossroads\nFile:Japan road sign 213.svg|Road works\nFile:Japan road sign 312.svg|No Vehicle Crossing\nFile:Japan road sign 303.svg|No entry\nFile:Japan road sign 330.svg|Stop\nFile:Japan road sign 407-A.svg|Pedestrian crossing\nFile:Japan road sign 314.svg|No overtaking\nFile:Japanese National Route Sign 0171.svg|National Route Sign\nFile:Japan road sign 323 (80).svg|Speed limit\n<\/center>"]]}]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Bihoro Pass.JPG"],["thumb"],[{"type":"[[","value":[["Bihoro"]]}," Pass and Highway 243, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Akan National Park"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hokkaido"]]}]]},"\n\nRental cars and driving in Japan are rare in or around the major cities, as public transport is generally excellent and gets you almost everywhere. In addition, the roads of major cities like Tokyo are plagued with massive traffic jams and parking is expensive and difficult to find, so driving there is more of a hindrance than anything else. However, many rural areas can really be explored with only your own transport, so driving should certainly not be dismissed out of hand, especially on the vast, sparsely populated island of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hokkaido"]]},". Due to Hokkaido's cooler climate it is a very popular destination in summer, so if you are considering renting a car at this time be sure to do so well in advance of your planned travel date as they are often unavailable at this time.

There is no \"right turn on red\" (or left turn, rather) rule in Japan, however in rare cases a sign with a blue arrow on a white background will indicate where turning on red is legal (not to be confused with the white arrow on a blue background, which indicates one-way traffic). Drivers are required to make a complete stop at all at-grade railway crossings. Driving while drunk can result in fines of up to ¥500,000 and instant loss of licence, at above the official \"drunk driving\" blood-alcohol limit of 0.25 mg. It's also an offence to \"drive under the influence\" with no set minimum that can be fined up to ¥300,000, with a suspension of license. Using a cell phone while driving without a hands-free kit can result in fines of up to ¥50,000.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Kyoto-higashi interchange 001.jpg"],["thumb"],["Toll plaza for the Meishin Highway at Kyoto-Higashi Interchange, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kyoto"]]},", with the marked ETC lane for automatic toll collection."]]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Tolls"]}," for the expressways (高速道路 ",{"type":"''","value":["kōsoku-dōro"]},") are generally significantly higher than the cost of a train ride, even on the bullet train. So for one or two people it's not cost-effective for direct long distance travel between cities. In major cities such as Tokyo and Osaka, a flat rate toll is paid when entering the expressway system. On inter-city expressways, tolls are based on distance travelled, a ticket is issued when you enter the system and the toll is calculated when you exit. Avoid the purple ETC lanes at toll plazas (unless you have the ETC device fitted) as they are reserved for electronic toll collection, any other lane will accept either yen cash (exact change not required) or major credit cards. Inter-city expressways are well-serviced with clean and convenient parking areas at regular intervals, but be wary of travelling into large cities on Sunday evenings or at the end of a holiday period, as traffic jams at these times can reach up to 50 km long. Using local roads to travel between cities has the advantages of being toll-free and offering more opportunities for sightseeing along the way, but traffic jams and numerous traffic lights slow things down considerably. Covering 40 km in 1 hour is a good rule of thumb to follow when planning an itinerary on local roads, generally more on Hokkaido.\n\nBoth rental costs and fuel are more expensive than those in the USA, but fuel is generally cheaper than found in Europe. Most fuel stations are full service, to fill up the tank with regular fuel, say ",{"type":"''","value":["regulaa mantan"]}," to the attendant. Rental car companies generally offer smaller cars from ¥5,000 a day, and a full size sedan will cost around ¥10,000 a day. Most rental cars have some kind of satellite navigation (\"navi\") thus you can ask the rental car company to set your destination before your first trip. Some models (specifically newer Toyotas) have an English language mode, so it doesn't hurt to ask the staff to change it before you head out. However unless you read Japanese you may need to ask for assistance to make full use of the navigation computer. Japanese driving habits are generally as good as anywhere else, and usually better than other Asian countries. Japanese roads are generally of good quality, with smooth bitumen surfaces. Gravel roads are very limited, usually forest roads, and unlikely to be on the itinerary of too many tourists. Roadworks are frequent however, and can cause annoying delays. Certain mountain passes are shut over winter, those that are not usually require either snow chains or a combination of studless winter tires and 4-wheel drive. If you rent a car in mountainous\/northern areas they will generally come with this equipment already included. \n\nNavigating within cities can be confusing and parking in them costs ¥300-400\/hour. Larger hotels in the cities and regional hotels normally offer car parking, but it would be wise to check car parking however before you book. Validated parking is available at some car parks that are attached to major department stores in large cities, but don't count on getting more than 2–3 hours free. The best car to use in Tokyo is a taxi.\n\nJapan has horizontal traffic lights, with any arrows appearing beneath the main lights. The color-blind should note that the red (stop) is on the right and the green (go) is on the left. There are usually only one or two traffic lights per intersection pointing the same way, which can make it hard to see when the signals change. However some prefectures, such as Toyama and Niigata, have vertical lights (this is supposedly due to the amount of snow they get).\n\nJapanese signs follow a mixture of European and North American conventions, but most should not pose any difficulty in understanding. \"Stop\" is indicated by a downward-pointing red triangle, not to be confused with the similar looking Yield sign found in North America. On the highways and around major cities English signage is very good; however in more remote locales it may be spotty. Electronic signs are everywhere on expressways and major arterial roads, and provide helpful real-time information on road conditions, unfortunately they are displayed exclusively in Japanese. The following is a brief list of the most common messages and their translations:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" 通行止 — Road Closed"]},{"type":"*","value":[" 渋滞 — Traffic Jam (with length and\/or delay indicated)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" 事故 — Accident"]},{"type":"*","value":[" 注意 — Caution"]},{"type":"*","value":[" チェーン規制 — Chains Required"]},"\nWarning hazards for repair, breakdown and construction are always well illuminated at night and tend to also appear at least once before the main obstacle on higher speed roads such as expressways. Other road hazards to be aware of are taxis, who feel they have a god-given right to stop wherever and whenever they like, long-distance truckers (especially late at night) who may often be hepped up on pep pills and tend to ride the bumper of any slower car in front, and country farmers in their ubiquitous white mini-trucks, who never seem to go above a crawl and may pop out of rural side roads unexpectedly. \n\nRoad speed limits are marked in kilometres per hour. They are 40 km\/h in towns (with varying areas: some at 30, roads by schools usually at 20), 50 to 60 in the countryside (if unmarked, the limit is 60), and 100 on the expressways. There is usually a fair bit of leeway in terms of speeding - about 10 km\/h on normal roads, for example. If you go with the flow you should not have any problems, as the Japanese often pay speed limits no more attention than they have to.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bike"]},"\nJapan has many great opportunities for bikers. Bike rentals can be found throughout the country, especially near popular routes.

If you choose to do this, be aware that you need to have it registered. If your bike does not have the proper sticker, your bike can be confiscated. It is important that any bike that is not a rental bike is registered under the rider's name. If you are caught borrowing a bike registered under someone else's name, it is considered ",{"type":"''","value":["stolen"]}," in Japan, and you will likely be taken to the police station.

Most Japanese under 40 have studied English for at least 6 years, but the instruction tends to focus on formal grammar and writing rather than actual conversation. As a result, outside of major tourist attractions and establishments that cater specifically to foreigners, it is rare to find people who are conversant in English. Reading and writing tends to come much better though, and many younger Japanese are able to understand a great deal of written English despite not being able to speak it. If lost, it can be practical to write out a question on paper in simple words and give it to someone young, preferably high school or college students, who will likely be able to point you in the right direction.

While 7-Elevens are everywhere, having more options is always recommended, so try to get either a UnionPay or Discover debit card before arrival for increased convenience (for instance, at Narita Airport, there are the \"usual\" foreign-capable ATMs on the 1st floor of Terminal 2 that get crowded when the international arrivals start coming, whereas the Mitsubishi-UFJ ATMs on the 2nd floor are wide open during most hours).\n\nOne thing to beware: many Japanese ATMs are ",{"type":"'''","value":["closed at night and during the weekends"]},", so it's best to get your banking done during office hours! An exception is 7-Eleven, which is open 24 hours.\n\nOn top of these, there are cash dispensers (abbreviated to \"CD\" in Japan), intended for credit card cash advances. Some will work with foreign-issued ATM\/debit\/credit cards.\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["SMBC"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["UC Card"]},", and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mitsubishi UFJ Card"]}," machines will take Visa and MasterCard."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Orico"]}," machines will take MasterCard only."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["JCB"]}," machines will take Visa, MasterCard, American Express, JCB, Discover and UnionPay."]},"\nNote the difference between CDs and ATMs, even for the same financial institution. For example, for foreign-issued cards SMBC and MUFG bank ATMs take UnionPay (MUFG also takes Discover), while SMBC and Mitsubishi UFJ Credit cash dispensers take only Visa\/MasterCard. Also note that cash dispensers are much rarer than bank ATMs; Orico, for instance, has fewer than 10 nationwide.\n\nA note for those using SMBC\/MUFG\/Mizuho\/Aeon ATMs: on-site staff at most branches are still unaware that their ATMs now accept foreign cards at all. If you're having trouble, pick up the handset next to the machine to talk to the central ATM support staff.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Vending machines"]}," in Japan are known for their pervasiveness and the (notorious) variety of products they sell. Most will take ¥1,000 bills, and some types such as train ticket machines will take up to ¥10,000; none accept ¥1 or ¥5 coins, and only some accept ¥2,000 notes. And even the most high-tech vending machines do not take credit cards, save for certain ones in train stations (though there are limitations — for example, JR East and West ticket vending machines require a PIN of four digits or less; most credit card customers would be better off purchasing from a ticket window). Note that cigarette vending machines require a Taspo card (age verification), which are unfortunately off limits to non residents, but local smokers are usually happy to lend you theirs. \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Prepaid electronic cards"]}," are quite popular in Japan for small purchases. There are cards for train fares, convenience store purchases, and public telephones, though they aren't interchangeable. \n\nThere is an ",{"type":"'''","value":["8% consumption tax"]}," on all sales in Japan.  Tax is ",{"type":"''","value":["usually"]},", but not always, included in displayed prices, so pay attention.  The word ",{"type":"''","value":["zeinuki"]}," (税抜) means tax-excluded, ",{"type":"''","value":["zeikomi"]}," (税込) means tax-included. If you cannot find out any words in the price card, most of them are tax-included.\n\nAlways keep a sizable stack of reserve money in Japan, as if you run out for any reason (wallet stolen, credit card blocked, etc.), it can be difficult to have any wired to you.  Western Union has a very limited presence even in the larger metropolitan areas (their agreement with Suruga Bank ended in 2009, and they have just started a new agreement with Daikokuya as of April 2011), banks will not allow you to open accounts without local ID, and even international postal money orders require proof of a residential address in Japan.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Banking"]},"\n\nBanking in Japan is a notoriously cumbersome process, especially for foreigners. You will need an alien resident card (ARC) and proof of a Japanese address. This means that while foreigners in Japan on an extended period (i.e. those on student, dependent or work visas) may open an account, this option is not available to those on short trips for tourism or business. Many banks also require you to have a Japanese seal (印鑑 ",{"type":"''","value":["inkan"]},") to stamp your documents with and signatures are often not accepted as a substitute. Bank staff often do not speak English or any other foreign languages. Unlike most other countries in the world, Japanese bank branches will often only have ATM's available during office hours, though this is changing (for instance, some Mitsubishi-UFJ branches now keep their ATMs available until 11PM).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Tipping"]},"\nTipping effectively does not exist in Japan, and attempting to offer tips can actually be seen as an insult. The Japanese pride themselves on the service given to customers, and a further financial incentive is unnecessary. If you leave a tip in a restaurant, the staff will probably come running after you to return the money you 'forgot'. Even bellhops in high end hotels usually do not accept tips. Exceptions are high-end ryokan (see ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Ryokan"],["Sleep"]]},") and English-speaking tour guides.\n\nSome restaurants do add a 10% service charge, and family restaurants may add a 10% late-night charge after midnight.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Costs"]},"\nJapan has a reputation for being extremely expensive — and it can be. However, many things have become significantly cheaper in the last decade. Japan need not be outrageously expensive if you plan carefully and in fact, is probably cheaper than ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Australia"]]}," and most ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Europe"],["European Union"]]}," countries for basic expenses. Food in particular can be a bargain, and while still expensive by Asian standards, eating out in Japan is generally cheaper than eating out in Western countries, with a basic meal consisting of rice or noodles starting from about ¥300 per serve. Of course, on the other end of the spectrum, fine dining can be very expensive, with prices on the order of ¥30,000 per person not unheard of. For long-distance travel, in particular, the Japan Rail Pass, Japan Bus Pass, and Visit Japan flights (see ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Get around"],["Get around"]]},") can save you a bundle. \n\nAs rough guidelines, you will find it very difficult to travel on less than ¥5,000 per day (but if you plan carefully, it is certainly possible) and you can expect a degree of comfort only if you pay 10,000. Staying in posh hotels, eating fancy meals or just travelling long-distance will easily double this yet again. Typical prices for moderate budget travel would be ¥5,000 for hotel, ¥2,000 for meals, and ¥2,000 again for entry fees and local transport.\n\nHowever, if you find yourself a little short on cash, you can get your essential items in one of the many ¥100 shops (百円ショップ ",{"type":"''","value":["hyaku-en shoppu"]},") located in most cities. ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.daiso-sangyo.co.jp\/english\/index.html Daiso"]}]}," is the Japan's largest ¥100 shop chain, with 2,500 shops across Japan. Other large chains are ",{"type":"'''","value":["Can Do"]}," (キャンドゥ), ",{"type":"'''","value":["Seria"]}," (セリア), and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Silk"]}," (シルク). There are also convenience-store-like ¥100 shops such as ",{"type":"''","value":["SHOP99"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["Lawson Store 100"]}," where you can buy sandwiches, drinks, and vegetables in addition to selected ¥100 items.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Tips for budget shopping"]},"\nAs noted above, Japan ",{"type":"'''","value":["can be"]}," expensive. You might feel every item or meal comes with a high price tag in Japan. The main reason for this is that you have chosen an inner-city top-end shopping or eating district. If you wish to buy more reasonably priced items, consider carefully whether you are desperately looking for upmarket products, or just want daily commodities and groceries. The former should try intown premium department stores, boutiques and restaurants in the well-publicized shopping districts such as Isetan in Shinjuku and Matsuya in Ginza, the latter would be better off turning their sights toward suburban shopping malls or supermarkets such as Aeon or Ito-Yokado.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Shopping"]},"\nThe 8% consumption tax imposed is not refundable for purchases of consumable items such as food and beverages. However, for non-consumable items like clothing and electronics, the tax may be refunded for purchases of ¥10,000 or more before tax in a single receipt if you are not a resident and intend to bring the items out of Japan when you leave.\n\nAt many department stores like Isetan, Seibu and Matsuzakaya, you typically pay the full cost at the cashier and go to a tax refund (税金還付 ",{"type":"''","value":["zeikin kanpu"]}," or 税金戻し ",{"type":"''","value":["zeikin modoshi"]},") counter, usually located at one of the higher floors, and present your receipt and passport to the counter to get reimbursed.  In some other stores advertising \"duty free\" (免税 ",{"type":"''","value":["menzei"]},"), you just present your passport to the cashier when making payment and the tax is deducted on the spot.\n\nWhen making tax free purchases or tax refund claims, counter staff would staple a piece of paper in your passport, which you should keep with you until you leave Japan. This piece of paper is to be surrendered to the customs counter at your point of departure just before you pass through immigration and checks may be done to ensure that you are bringing the items out of Japan.\n\nDespite the saying that Japanese cities never sleep, retail hours are surprisingly limited. Opening hours of most shops are typically 10:00-20:00, though most shops are open on weekends and public holidays except New Year, and close on one day a week. Restaurants typically stay open until late at night, though smoking would usually be allowed after 20:00 so those who can't stand cigarette smoke should have your meals before then. \n\nHowever, you will always find something you could need to buy at any time of day. Japan is crawling with 24\/7 convenience stores (コンビニ ",{"type":"''","value":["konbini"]},"), such as 7-Eleven, Family Mart, Lawson, Circle K, and Sunkus. They often offer a much wider range of products than convenience stores in the US or Europe, sometimes have a small ATM and are often open all day all week! Many convenience stores also offer services such as fax, ",{"type":"''","value":["takkyubin"]}," luggage delivery, a limited range of postal services, payment services for bills (including topping up international phone cards such as Brastel) and some on-line retailers (e.g. Amazon.jp), and ticket sales for events, concerts and cinemas.\n\nOf course, establishments related to night life such as karaoke lounges and bars stay open well into the night: even in small towns it is easy to find an izakaya open until 05:00. Pachinko parlours are obliged to close at 23:00.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Anime and manga"]},"\nTo many Westerners, ",{"type":"''","value":["anime"]}," (animation) and ",{"type":"''","value":["manga"]}," (comics) are the most popular icons of modern Japan.

",{"type":"[[","value":[["Akihabara"]]}," is an \"otaku\" mecca. With everything from manga to electronics. You can also spend all day at the various arcades. Several of which are owned by SEGA and sport an amazing cast of games. Deep in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Akihabara"]]}," you can find Mandrake. Mandrake is a massive multi-level anime\/collectibles store. There are also stores filled with showcases; each one hosting a cast from an anime or manga. To buy toys from these show cases you need to find a slip of paper and write down the code of the toy you want, then take the paper to the counter and the attendant will retrieve the toy for you. It's easy and effective, although the stores can becomes quite busy at times. Besides these stores, all throughout ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Akihabara"]]}," you will find little shops selling figures from various animes and mangas. Truly a must-visit for any lover of anime and manga. Another option other than ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Akihabara"]]}," is Ikebukuro located nearer to Shinjuku. The original Animate store is located near Ikebukuro East exit, and nearby are cosplay stores and a Mandarake store.   A well known shopping spot to locals are the Book-Off chain stores. They specialise in selling second-hand books, manga, anime, video games and DVDs. The quality of the products can range from almost brand new (read once) to more well loved. Be sure to check out the ￥105 area where the quality of the books may be more well-loved, but there are many great finds. There is a small range of English translated manga but the majority are in Japanese.  They also sell anime in DVDs (regular and Blu-ray) but be aware that they will be set to region 2 (Japan). Also available are video games ranging from Playstation games to DS games. (Be aware for DS games, that DS games will work on any region DS (3DS) however 3DS games have been region locked. )\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Video and PC games"]},"\nVideo games are a huge business in Japan, but Japan's ",{"type":"'''","value":["NTSC-J"]}," video standard is incompatible with PAL and SECAM televisions used in much of the world.

(Some of the larger stores will provide you with an English manual (英語の説明書 ",{"type":"''","value":["eigo no setsumeisho"]},") on request.) There are no great deals to be found pricewise, but the selection is unparalleled. However, if you are buying other electronics to take home, it's best to shop at stores that specialize in \"overseas\" configurations, many of which can be found in Tokyo's ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tokyo\/Akihabara"],["Akihabara"]]},". You can get PAL\/NTSC region-free DVD players, for example. Also, keep in mind that Japanese AC runs at 100 volts, so using \"native\" Japanese electronics outside Japan without a step-down transformer can be dangerous. Even the US standard 120V voltage is too much for some devices. Conversely, some are being built as 100-120V devices to account for this possibility. Always check before buying. Probably the best deal is not electronics per se, but blank media. In particular, Blu-ray optical media for video and data is much, much cheaper than anywhere else.\n\nPrices are lowest and shopping is the easiest at giant discount stores like Bic Camera, Yodobashi Camera, Sofmap and Yamada Denki. They usually have English-speaking staff on duty and accept foreign credit cards. For common products the prices at any are virtually identical, so don't waste time comparison shopping. Bargaining is possible in smaller shops, and even the larger chains will usually match their competitors' prices.\n\nMost of the big chains have a \"point card\" that gets you points that can be used as a discount on your next purchase, even just a few minutes later. Purchases tend to earn points between 5% and even 20% of the purchase price, and 1 point is worth ¥1. Some stores (the biggest being Yodobashi Camera)) require you to wait overnight before being able to redeem points. The cards are handed out on the spot and no local address is needed. However, some stores may not allow you to earn points and receive a tax refund on the same purchase.\n\nAlso, major stores tend to deduct 2% from points earned if paid using a credit card (if using a UnionPay credit card, Bic and Yodobashi will disallow you from earning points entirely, though you get an instant 5% discount as compensation). With the consumption tax now raised to 8%, whether you choose to get the tax waived or to earn points will depend on how you pay and whether you plan on returning; if you plan on paying with cash or e-money and plan on returning, it may still be worth it to earn points. If paying by credit card, it becomes a wash with 8% advantage either way, and the tax refund may be more useful.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Fashion"]},"\nWhile you may be better off heading for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["France"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Italy"]]}," for high end fashion, when it comes to casual fashion, Japan is hard to beat.

The main problem is that Japanese shops cater to Japanese-sized customers, and finding larger or curvier sizes can be real challenge.\n\nJapan is also famous for its beauty products such as facial cream and masks, including many for men.  While these are available in almost every supermarket, the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tokyo\/Ginza"],["Ginza"]]}," district of Tokyo is where many of the most expensive brands have their own shops.\n\nJapan's main contribution to jewelry is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["cultured pearl"]},", invented by Mikimoto Kōkichi in 1893.  The main pearl growing operation to this day is in the small town of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Toba"]]}," near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ise"]]},", but the pearls themselves are widely available — although there is little if any price difference to buying them outside Japan. For those who insist on getting their hands on the \"authentic\" stuff, Mikimoto's flagship store is in the Ginza district of Tokyo.\n\nThen of course there is ",{"type":"''","value":["kimono"]},", the classic Japanese garment.

Japan has few domestic brands:  Seven Stars and Mild Seven are the most common local brands. American brands such as Marlboro, Camel and Lucky Strike are extremely popular although the Japanese-produced versions have a much lighter taste than their western counterparts.

You shouldn't \"whittle\" your chopsticks after breaking them apart. Many restaurants give you a hot towel (",{"type":"''","value":["o-shibori"]},") to wipe your hands with as soon as you sit down; use it for your hands, and not your face.\n\nMany Japanese dishes come with different sauces and garnishes. Japanese never put soy sauce on their rice; they eat bowls of rice plain, or sometimes with ",{"type":"''","value":["furikake"]},", a blend of crumbled seaweed, fish, and spices. Soy sauce is used for dipping sushi in before eating, and they pour it on grilled fish and tofu as well.

For cultural and practical reasons, Japanese almost never invite guests to their homes, so socializing nearly always involves eating out. As a result, eating out is generally cheaper than in Western countries (though still expensive by Asian standards) if you stick to a basic rice or noodles meal at a local joint, though at the other end of the spectrum, fine dining can be very expensive indeed.\n\nAccording to the Michelin Guide, which rates restaurants in major cities around the world, Tokyo is the most \"delicious\" city in the world with over 150 restaurants that received at least one star (out of three). In comparison, Paris and London received a total of 148 between them.\n\nMost Japanese-style restaurants have lunchtime ",{"type":"''","value":["teishoku"]}," (定食), or ",{"type":"'''","value":["fixed set"]}," meals. These typically consist of a meat or fish dish, with a bowl of ",{"type":"''","value":["miso"]}," soup, pickles, and rice (often with free extra helpings). These can be as inexpensive as ¥600 yet ample enough even for large appetites. Menus will, for most establishments, be in Japanese only; however, many restaurants have models (many in exquisite detail) of their meals in their front window, and if you can't read the menu it may be better to take the waiter or waitress outside and point at what you would like. You might also find these types of set meals at dinner.

When it's getting late, a server will usually come to your table to tell you it's time for the \"last order.\" When it's really time to go, Japanese restaurants have a universal signal — they start to play \"Auld Lang Syne\". (This is true across the country, except at the most expensive places.) That means \"pay up and move out.\"\n\nMany cheap chain eateries have ",{"type":"'''","value":["vending machines"]}," where you buy a ticket and give it to the server. At most of these restaurants, you'll have to be able to read Japanese to use them, though. At some of these restaurants, there will be plastic displays or photographs of the food with varying prices in front of them. It is often possible to match the price, along with some of the kana (characters) to the choices at the machine. If you're open-minded and flexible, you might get ",{"type":"''","value":["shōyu"]}," (soy sauce) ramen instead of ",{"type":"''","value":["miso"]}," (fermented soy bean) ramen or you might get ",{"type":"''","value":["katsu"]}," (pork cutlet) curry instead of beef curry.

Some supermarkets are even open 24 hours a day.\n\nOne Japanese institution worth checking out is the ",{"type":"''","value":["depachika"]}," (デパ地下) or department store basement food court, featuring dozens of tiny specialist stalls dishing up local specialties ranging from exquisitely packed tea ceremony candies to fresh sushi and Chinese takeaway.  They're often a little upmarket pricewise, but almost all offer free samples and there are always a few reasonably priced ones in the mix.  In the evenings, many slash prices on unsold food, so look for stickers like ",{"type":"''","value":["hangaku"]}," (半額, \"half price\") or ",{"type":"''","value":["san-wari biki"]}," (3割引, \"30% off\") to get a bargain. 割 means \"1\/10\" and 引 means \"off\".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Dietary restrictions"]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["Eating vegetarian"]},"\nDespite its image as light and healthy cuisine, everyday Japanese food can be quite heavy in salt and fat, with deep-fried meat or seafood being prominent.

(There is a kelp variant called ",{"type":"''","value":["kombudashi"]},", but it's fairly uncommon.) ",{"type":"''","value":["Soba"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["udon"]}," noodle soups, in particular, virtually always use bonito-based ",{"type":"''","value":["katsuodashi"]},", and typically the only vegetarian-safe item on the menu in a noodle shop is ",{"type":"''","value":["zarusoba"]},", or plain cold noodles — but even for this the dipping sauce typically contains ",{"type":"''","value":["dashi"]},".\n\nAn excellent option is the ",{"type":"''","value":["kaiten"]}," (conveyor belt) sushi shop.

These types of sushi tend to be less popular than the sushi using marine animal products, so you may not see them revolving in front of your eyes on the conveyor belt. Just shout out the name of the type of sushi you want and the sushi chef will prepare it for you right away. When you are ready to leave, call the waitress over and she'll count your plates. The vegetarian sushi options are always inexpensive.\n\nFor anyone living in big cities, especially Tokyo, an excellent option is organic or macrobiotic food, known as ",{"type":"''","value":["shizenshoku"]}," (自然食). While \"vegetarian food\" may sound boring or even unappetizing to Japanese ears, ",{"type":"''","value":["shizenshoku"]}," is quite in vogue as of late, although meals may cost about ¥3000 and menus may still contain seafood items.  While considerably harder to find, it's worth looking out for a restaurant (often run by temples) that offers ",{"type":"''","value":["shōjin ryori"]}," (精進料理), the purely vegetarian cuisine developed by Buddhist monks. This cuisine is highly regarded and thus often very expensive, but is often available at reasonable prices if you stay at temples.\n\nFortunately, traditional Japanese cuisine contains an ample amount of protein through its great variety of soy products: tofu, ",{"type":"''","value":["miso"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["nattō"]},", and ",{"type":"''","value":["edamame"]}," (tender green soy beans in their pods), for example.

Awareness of severe allergies is low and restaurant staff are rarely aware of trace ingredients in their menu items.  Japanese law requires that seven allergens be listed on product packaging: eggs (卵 ",{"type":"''","value":["tamago"]},"), milk (乳 ",{"type":"''","value":["nyū"]},"), wheat (小麦 ",{"type":"''","value":["komugi"]},"), buckwheat (そば or 蕎麦 ",{"type":"''","value":["soba"]},"), peanuts (落花生 ",{"type":"''","value":["rakkasei"]}," or ピーナッツ ",{"type":"''","value":["pīnattsu"]},"), shrimp (えび ",{"type":"''","value":["ebi"]},") and crab (かに ",{"type":"''","value":["kani"]},").  Sometimes these are listed in a handy table, but more often you'll need to read the tiny print in Japanese only.  Packaging is also often less than helpful for anything outside these seven, with ingredients like \"starch\" (でんぷん ",{"type":"''","value":["denpun"]},") or \"salad oil\" (サラダ油 ",{"type":"''","value":["sarada-abura"]},") that can contain basically anything.\n\nA serious ",{"type":"'''","value":["soy"]}," (大豆 ",{"type":"''","value":["daizu"]},") allergy is basically incompatible with Japanese food.  The bean is used everywhere, not just the obvious soy sauce and tofu, but also things like soybean powder in crackers and soybean oil for cooking.\n\nKeeping a ",{"type":"''","value":["strict"]}," ",{"type":"'''","value":["gluten-free"]}," diet while eating out is also close to impossible.  Most common brands of soy sauce and mirin contain wheat, while miso is often made with barley or wheat.  While sushi is traditionally made with 100% rice vinegar and pure wasabi root, commercially prepared sushi vinegar and wasabi may both contain gluten.  If you have some tolerance, though, Japan and its vast variety of rice dishes is quite navigable.

Butter (バター ",{"type":"''","value":["bataa"]},") does make an occasional appearance, but is usually mentioned by name.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Peanuts"]}," or other tree nuts are basically not used in Japanese cooking, with the exception of a few snacks and desserts, where their presence should be obvious (and marked in the ingredients).

This is notably higher than most of Europe and the Americas (excepting the United States).  However, ID verification is almost never requested at restaurants, bars, convenience stores or other purveyors of liquor, so long as the purchaser does not appear obviously underage. The main exception is in the large clubs in Shibuya, Tokyo, which are popular with young Tokyoites and during busy times will ID everyone entering the club. However, most clubs will accept any form of ID. They will normally ask for a passport, but if you show them a driver's license (legitimate or non-legitimate), they will accept it. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Where to drink"]},"\nIf you're looking for an evening of food and drink in a relaxed traditional atmosphere, go to an ",{"type":"'''''","value":["izakaya"]}," (居酒屋, Japanese-style pub), easily identified by red lanterns with the character \"酒\" (",{"type":"''","value":["alcohol"]},") hanging out front.

Very convenient, an ",{"type":"''","value":["izakaya"]}," will usually have a lively, convivial atmosphere, as it often acts as a living room of sorts for office workers, students and seniors. Food is invariably good and reasonably priced, and in all, they are an experience not to be missed.\n\nWhile Western-style bars can also be found here and there, typically charging ¥500-1,000 for drinks, a more common Japanese institution is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["snack"]}," (スナック ",{"type":"''","value":["sunakku"]},"). These are slightly dodgy operations where paid hostesses pour drinks, sing karaoke, massage egos (and sometimes a bit more) and charge upwards of ¥3,000\/hour for the service. Tourists will probably feel out of place and many do not even admit non-Japanese patrons.\n\nDedicated gay bars are comparatively rare in Japan, but the districts of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tokyo\/Shinjuku"],["Shinjuku ni-chome"]]}," in Tokyo and Doyama-cho in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Osaka"]]}," have busy gay scenes. Most gay\/lesbian bars serve a small niche (muscular men, etc.) and will not permit those who do not fit the mold, including the opposite sex, to enter. While a few are Japanese only, foreigners are welcome at most bars.\n\nNote that izakaya, bars and snacks typically have cover charges (カバーチャージ ",{"type":"''","value":["kabā chāji"]},"), usually around ¥500 but on rare occasions more, so ask if the place looks really swish. In izakayas this often takes the form of being served some little nibble (お通し ",{"type":"''","value":["otōshi"]},") as you sit down, and no, you can't refuse it and not pay. Some bars also charge a cover charge ",{"type":"''","value":["and"]}," an additional fee for any peanuts you're served with your beer.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Vending machines"]}," (自動販売機 ",{"type":"''","value":["jidōhanbaiki"]},") are omnipresent in Japan and serve up drinks 24 hours a day at the price of ¥120-150 a can\/bottle, although some places with captive customers, including the top of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mount Fuji"]]},", will charge more. In addition to cans of soft drinks, tea and coffee, you can find vending machines that sell beer, sake and even hard liquor. In winter, some machines will also dispense hot drinks — look for a red label with the writing あたたかい (",{"type":"''","value":["atatakai"]},") instead of the usual blue つめたい (",{"type":"''","value":["tsumetai"]},"). Vending machines that sell alcoholic beverages are usually switched off at 23:00. Also, more and more of these machines, especially those near a school, require the use of a special \"Sake Pass\" obtainable at the city hall of the city the machine is located in. The pass is available to anyone of 20 years of age or over. Many vending machines at stations in the Tokyo metropolitan area accept payment using the JR Suica or PASMO cards.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Sake\/nihonshu"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Sake.jpg"],["thumb"],["Flat ",{"type":"''","value":["sakazuki"]}," tray, a small ",{"type":"''","value":["choko"]}," cup and a wooden ",{"type":"''","value":["masu"]}," box"]]},"\n\nSake is a fermented alcoholic beverage brewed from rice. Though often called rice wine, in fact the sake making process is completely different from wine or beer making. The fermentation process uses both a mold to break down the starches and yeast to create the alcohol. The Japanese word ",{"type":"''","value":["sake"]}," (酒) can in fact mean any kind of alcoholic drink, and in Japan the word ",{"type":"''","value":["nihonshu"]}," (日本酒) is used to refer to what Westerners call \"sake\".\n\nSake is around 15% alcohol, and can be served at a range of temperatures from hot (熱燗 ",{"type":"''","value":["atsukan"]},"), to room temperature (常温",{"type":"''","value":["jo-on"]},"), down to chilled (冷や ",{"type":"''","value":["hiya"]},"). Contrary to popular belief most sake is not served hot, but often chilled. Each sake is brewed for a preferred serving temperature, but defaulting to room temperature is in most cases safe. If you are inclined to have one hot or chilled in a restaurant, asking your waiter or bartender for a recommendation would be a good idea. In restaurants, one serving can start around ¥500, and go up from there.\n\nSake has its own measures and utensils. The little ceramic cups are called ",{"type":"''","value":["choko"]}," (ちょこ) and the small ceramic jug used to pour it is a ",{"type":"''","value":["tokkuri"]}," (徳利). Sometimes sake will be poured into a small glass set in a wooden box to collect the overflow as the server pours all the way to the top and keeps pouring. Just drink from the glass, then pour the extra out of the box and back into your glass as you go. Occasionally, particularly when drinking it cold, you can sip your sake from the corner of a cedar box called a ",{"type":"''","value":["masu"]}," (枡), sometimes with a dab of salt on the edge. Sake is typically measured in ",{"type":"''","value":["gō"]}," (合, 180 mL), roughly the size of a ",{"type":"''","value":["tokkuri"]},", ten of which make up the standard 1.8 L ",{"type":"''","value":["isshōbin"]}," (一升瓶) bottle.\n\nThe fine art of sake tasting is at least as complex as wine, but the one indicator worth looking out for is ",{"type":"''","value":["nihonshudo"]}," (日本酒度), a number often printed on bottles and menus. Simply put, this \"sake level\" measures the sweetness of the brew, with positive values indicating drier sake and negative values being sweeter, the average being around +2.\n\nSake is brewed in several grades and styles that depend upon how much the rice is milled to prevent off flavors, if any water is added, or if additional alcohol is added. ",{"type":"''","value":["Ginjō"]}," (吟醸) and ",{"type":"''","value":["daiginjō"]}," (大吟醸) are measures of how much the rice has been milled, with the daiginjo more highly milled and correspondingly more expensive. These two may have alcohol added primarily to improve the flavor and aroma. ",{"type":"''","value":["Honjōzō"]}," (本醸造) is less milled, with alcohol added, and may be less expensive; think of it as an everyday kind of sake. ",{"type":"''","value":["Junmai"]}," (純米), meaning pure rice, is an additional term that specifies that only rice was used. When making a purchase, price is often a fair indicator of quality.\n\nA few special brews may be worth a try if you feel like experimenting. ",{"type":"''","value":["Nigorizake"]}," (濁り酒) is lightly filtered and looks cloudy, with white sediment at the bottom of the bottle. Turn the bottle gently once or twice to mix this sediment back into the drink. Though most sake ages badly, some brewers are able to create aged sake with a much stronger flavor and deep colors. These aged sake or ",{"type":"''","value":["koshu"]}," (古酒) may be an acquired taste, but worthwhile for the adventurous after a meal.\n\nWorth a special mention is ",{"type":"''","value":["amazake"]}," (甘酒), similar to the lumpy homebrewed ",{"type":"''","value":["doburoku"]}," (どぶろく) version of sake, drunk hot in the winter (often given away free at shrines on New Year's Eve). ",{"type":"''","value":["Amazake"]}," has very little alcohol and it tastes pretty much like fermented rice glop (better than it sounds), but at least it is cheap. As its name implies, it is sweet. \n\nIf you are curious about sake, the Japan Sake Brewers Association has an online version of its ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.japansake.or.jp\/sake\/english\/index.html English brochure"]},".

Larger bottles give you the opportunity to engage in the custom of constantly refilling your companions' glasses (and having yours topped off as well).

In many establishments, a ",{"type":"''","value":["dai-jokki"]}," (\"big mug\") holds a full liter of brew.\n\nSome Japanese bartenders have an annoying habit of filling half of your mug with head so that you only have half a glass of actual beer. Though the Japanese like their draft beer poured that way, you may find it irritating, especially when you pay ￥600 for a glass of beer as in many restaurants and bars. If you have the gumption to ask for less head, say ",{"type":"''","value":["awa wa sukoshi dake ni shite kudasai"]}," (\"please, just a little foam\").

Onsen baths can be either in standalone buildings available for anybody (外湯 ",{"type":"''","value":["sotoyu"]},"), or private guest-only baths inside your lodgings (内湯 ",{"type":"''","value":["uchiyu"]},").\n\nWhile most onsen are run commercially and charge fees for entry (¥500-1000 is typical), especially in remote areas there are free publicly maintained baths that offer minimal facilities but, more often than not, stunning views to make up for it. Many of these are mixed (混浴 ",{"type":"''","value":["kon'yoku"]},"), but while men still happily traipse into these naked, if holding a towel in front of their dangly bits, it's a rare woman who'll enter one without a bathing suit these days. Commercial operations with ",{"type":"''","value":["kon'yoku"]}," baths tend to enforce bathing suits for both sexes.\n\nTo find those really off the beaten track hot spring inns, check out the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.hitou.or.jp\/en\/index.html Japanese Association to Protect Hidden Hot Springs"]}]}," (日本秘湯を守る会 ",{"type":"''","value":["Nihon hitō wo mamoru kai"]},"), which consists of 185 independent lodges throughout the country.\n\nMany onsen prohibit the entry of visitors with ",{"type":"'''","value":["tattoos"]},". Intended to keep out ",{"type":"''","value":["yakuza"]}," gangsters (who often sport full-back tattoos), the rule is usually applied with a modicum of common sense, but heavily tattooed visitors will, at the very least, receive curious looks and may be asked to leave.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[{"type":"''","value":["Sentō"]}," and spas"]},"\n\n",{"type":"''","value":["Sentō"]}," (銭湯) are ",{"type":"'''","value":["public bath houses"]}," found in any large city.

Some, however, have gone upmarket and turned into ",{"type":"'''","value":["spas"]}," (スパ ",{"type":"''","value":["supa"]},"), which, in Japan, does not mean Balinese huts offering Ayurvedic massage while getting sprinkled with orchids, but public baths for stressed-out salarymen, often with a capsule hotel (see ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Sleep"],["Sleep"]]},") bolted on the side. As you might expect, these come in varying degrees of legitimacy — in particular, beware any place advertising \"esthe\", \"health\", or \"soap\" — but most are surprisingly decent.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Etiquette"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:SentoLayout.C73.English.jpg"],["thumb"],["The layout of a typical ",{"type":"''","value":["sento"]}]]},"\n\nJapanese are understanding of the funny ways of foreigners, but there's one rule where no exceptions are made: ",{"type":"'''","value":["you have to wash yourself and rinse off all foam ",{"type":"''","value":["before"]}," entering the bath"]},". The water in the tub will be reused by the next person, and the Japanese consider it disgusting to soak in someone else's dirt! Basically, wash up as well as you hope the guy next to you has done.\n\nBe it a fancy ",{"type":"''","value":["onsen"]}," or a barebones ",{"type":"''","value":["sentō"]},", the choreography of an entire visit goes roughly as follows:\n\nShared bathing areas are usually sex-segregated, so look for the characters \"man\" (男) and \"woman\" (女) to pick the correct entrance. Men's baths also typically have blue curtains, while women's are red. Enter the changing room, leaving shoes or slippers at the doorway; at public baths there may be keyed lockers.\n\nAt public baths (",{"type":"''","value":["sentō"]},"), you either pay the attendant directly (often through the changing room entrance, and it's almost always a woman), or use a vending machine in the entrance to buy tickets for entry and extra items such as towels or soap, which you then give to the attendant. On vending machines, look near the top for the Japanese words for \"adult\" (大人 ",{"type":"''","value":["otona"]},") and \"child\" (子供 ",{"type":"''","value":["kodomo"]},"). (If the vending machine is too difficult to figure out, you can probably walk in and say ",{"type":"''","value":["sumimasen"]}," (\"excuse me\") to the attendant and accomplish the rest by gesturing.)\n\nInside the changing room, there will be rows of clothes lockers or baskets. Pick a locker and ",{"type":"'''","value":["undress completely"]},", placing all your garments in the basket. Be sure to place your valuables in lockers, if there are any, and take the key with you into the bath.\n\nYou'll be given a teeny-weeny washcloth for free, or sometimes a token fee. It's not particularly good for covering your privates (it's too small) and it's not much use for drying off, either. Larger towels are available, again sometimes for a fee; men should leave these in the changing room and take only their washcloth, but women can use these to wrap up with. If you'd like one, ask the attendant for a ",{"type":"''","value":["taoru"]},".\n\nAfter removing your clothes and entering the bathing area, take a little stool and a bucket, sit down at a faucet, and clean yourself really, really well. Shampoo your hair, soap your entire body, repeat. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Rinse all foam off once clean."]}," Try not to leave the water running, or get water on other people.\n\nOnly now can you enter the bath tub. Do so slowly, as the water can often be very hot indeed; if it's unbearable, try another tub. If you do manage to get in, don't let your washcloth touch the water, as it's considered mildly bad form; you may wish to fold it atop your head, or just lay it aside. When sufficiently cooked, you may wash yourself once again if you're so inclined and repeat the process in reverse; it's fine to save washing your hair for after the bath, too, if you prefer. (At natural hot springs, though, you shouldn't rinse off the bath water, which is full of minerals that the Japanese consider healthy folk medicine.)\n\nNote that the bath is for soaking and light conversation; don't roughhouse, submerge your head, or make a lot of noise. Japanese people may be a bit wary of foreigners in the bath, mostly because they're afraid you'll try to talk to them in English and they'll be embarrassed that they can't communicate with you. Just give them a token nod\/bow, say ",{"type":"''","value":["ohayo gozaimasu"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["konnichiwa"]},", or ",{"type":"''","value":["konbanwa"]}," depending on the time of day, and wait to see if they're interested in talking to you.\n\nAfter your bath is finished, you can nearly always find a relaxation lounge (休憩室 ",{"type":"''","value":["kyūkeishitsu"]},"), inevitably equipped with a beer vending machine nearby. Feel free to sprawl out in your ",{"type":"''","value":["yukata"]},", sip beer, talk with friends, take a nap.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Toilets"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:WirelessToiletControlPanel.jpg"],["thumb"],["A typical washlet control panel."]]},"\n\nSome features of Japan's toilets are worth mentioning. As elsewhere in Asia, you will find both Western-style porcelain thrones for sitting and floor-level units for squatting. (If you're unfamiliar with these, it's simple: pull your pants down to your knees, and squat facing the curved hood of the toilet. Get closer to the hood than it looks like you need to, or else you might miss.)\n\nIn private homes and home-style accommodations, you will often find ",{"type":"'''","value":["toilet slippers"]},", which are to be worn inside the toilet and ",{"type":"''","value":["only"]}," inside the toilet.\n\nHowever, most visitors come away impressed by the undeniable fact that Japan is the world's leader in ",{"type":"'''","value":["toilet technology"]},". Over half of Japan's homes are equipped with high-tech devices known as ",{"type":"'''","value":["washlets"]}," (ウォシュレット), which incorporate all sorts of handy features like seat warmers, hot air dryers and ",{"type":"'''","value":["tiny robotic arms that squirt water"]},". The device is operated via a control panel and may incorporate over 30 buttons (all labeled in Japanese) at first glance bearing more resemblance to a Space Shuttle navigation panel than your average WC.\n\nDon't panic — help is at hand. The first key to solving the puzzle is that the actual flush mechanism is usually ",{"type":"'''","value":["not"]}," operated by the control panel: instead, there is a standard, familiar, Western-style lever, switch or knob somewhere and it is thus entirely possible to take care of your business without ever using the washlet features.  (In rare cases, mostly with very high-end gear, flushing is integrated; if lifting your bottom off the seat doesn't do the trick, look for buttons labeled 大 or 小, meaning a big or small flush respectively, on a wireless control panel on the wall.)  The second key to exploration is that there is always a big red button labeled 止 on the panel — pressing this will instantly ",{"type":"'''","value":["stop everything"]},". Older models simply have a lever nearby that controls the flow of a sprayer.\n\nArmed with this knowledge you can now begin to dig deeper. Typical controls include the following:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"''","value":["Oshiri"]}," (おしり) - \"buttocks\", for spraying your rear - typically shown in blue with a stylized butt icon; this action can be unnerving, but travellers should not be afraid - by the second or third attempt it will seem normal"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"''","value":["Bidet"]}," (ビデ) - for spraying your front - typically shown in pink with a female icon"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"''","value":["Kansō"]}," (乾燥) - \"dry\", for drying off when finished - typically yellow with a wavy air icon"]},"\nOther, smaller buttons can be used to adjust the exact pressure, angle, location and pulsation of the jet of water. Sometimes the seat of the toilet is heated, and this can also be regulated. One explanation is that since houses are not usually centrally heated, the toilet business can be made a little more convenient by heating the seat. To be polite and save energy, you should leave the cover down on heated toilet seats.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Ku-Nel-Asob.JPG"],["thumb"],["Room with a view, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oboke and Koboke"]]}]]},"\n\nIn addition to the usual youth hostels and business hotels, you can find several kinds of uniquely Japanese accommodation, ranging from rarefied ",{"type":"'''''","value":["ryokan"]}," inns to strictly functional ",{"type":"'''","value":["capsule hotels"]}," and utterly over-the-top ",{"type":"'''","value":["love hotels"]},".\n\nWhen reserving any Japanese accommodations, bear in mind that many smaller operations may hesitate to accept foreigners, fearing language difficulties or other cultural misunderstandings. This is to some extent institutionalized: large travel agency databases note the few hotels are prepared to handle foreigners, and they may tell you that all lodgings are booked if only these are full.\nInstead of calling up in English, you may find it better to get a Japanese acquaintance or local tourist office to make the booking for you. Alternatively, for cheap Internet rates, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/travel.rakuten.co.jp\/en\/ Rakuten's English search tool"]}," is a valuable utility. Note that prices are almost always given ",{"type":"'''","value":["per person"]},", not per room. Otherwise, you may have a rather unpleasant shock when your party of five tries to check out.\n\nWhen checking in to any type of accommodation, the hotel is required by law to make a copy of your passport unless you are a resident of Japan. It is a good idea, especially if you are travelling in groups, to present the clerk a ",{"type":"'''","value":["photo copy of your passport"]}," to speed up check-in. Aside from this, remember that Japan is mostly a ",{"type":"''","value":["cash only"]}," country, and credit cards are usually not accepted in smaller forms of accommodation, including, but not limited to, small business hotels. Bring enough cash to be able to pay in advance.\n\nOne thing to beware in wintertime: traditional Japanese houses are designed to be cool in summer, which all too often means that they are ",{"type":"'''","value":["freezing cold inside"]}," in winter. Bulk up on clothing and make good use of the bathing facilities to stay warm; fortunately, ",{"type":"''","value":["futon"]}," bedding is usually quite warm and getting a good night's sleep is rarely a problem.\n\nWhile accommodation in Japan is expensive, you may find that you can comfortably use a lower standard of hotel than you would in other countries. Shared baths will usually be spotless, and theft is very unusual in Japan. Just don't expect to sleep in late: check-out time is invariably ",{"type":"'''","value":["10:00"]},", and any extensions to this will have to be paid for.\n\nYou may have difficulty finding rooms at the busiest holiday times, such as \"Golden Week\" at the beginning of May;  and prices are commonly higher on Saturday nights.   But ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.toyoko-inn.com\/eng\/ Toyoko Inn"]}]}," business hotels in towns not listed in your guidebook often have vacancies, and their website is excellent.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Hotels"]},"\nWestern-branded hotels are rare outside Tokyo and Osaka; elsewhere, it's Japanese brands like ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.jalhotels.com JAL\/Nikko"]}]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.rihga.com\/ Rihga Royal"]}]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.princehotels.com Prince"]}]}," that rule the roost. Full-service five-star hotels can turn pampering into an artform, but tend to be rather bland and generic in appearance, despite steep prices starting from ¥20,000 ",{"type":"''","value":["per person"]}," (not per room). However, there are several types of uniquely Japanese and far more affordable hotels:\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Capsule hotels"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Susukino CapsuleHotel.JPG"],["thumb"],["Space-efficient sleeping in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sapporo"]]}]]},"\n\nCapsule hotels are the ultimate in space-efficient sleeping: for a small fee (normally between ¥3000 and ¥4000), the guest rents himself a ",{"type":"'''","value":["capsule"]},", sized about 2 x 1 x 1m  and stacked in two rows inside a hall containing tens if not hundreds of capsules. Capsule hotels are segregated by sex, and only a few cater to women.\n\nOn entry to a capsule hotel, take off your shoes, place them in a locker and put on a pair of slippers. You will often have to surrender your locker key at check-in to insure that you do not slip out without paying! On checking in you will be given a second locker for placing your belongings, as there is no space for them in the capsule and little security as most capsules have simply a curtain, not a door. Beware though if there is a curtain, since probing hands may enter it.\n\nMany if not most capsule hotels are attached to a spa of varying degrees of luxury and\/or legitimacy, often so that entry to the spa costs perhaps ¥2000 but the capsule is only an additional ¥1000. The cheapest capsule hotels will require feeding in ¥100 coins even to get the shower to work. This being Japan, there are always vending machines on hand to dispense toothpaste, underwear and sundries.\n\nOnce you retire into your capsule, you will usually find a simple control panel for operating the lights, the alarm clock and the inevitable built-in TV. If you oversleep, you may be hit with another day's charge.\n\nIn Tokyo's Shinjuku and Shibuya districts the capsule hotels run at least ¥3500, but have excellent free massage chairs, saunas, public baths, disposable razors and shampoo, magazines, and coffee in the morning. Despite all that, keep in mind that your capsule \"door\" is just a curtain that keeps light out. You will likely hear a steady stream of drunk and sleepy business men crawling into their capsules above and across from you before falling into a mild snore.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Love hotels"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Love hotel"]}," is a bit of a euphemism; a more accurate term would be ",{"type":"'''","value":["sex hotel"]},". They can be found in and near red light districts, but most are not in those areas. Many of them are often clustered around highway interchanges or main train stations out of the city and back to the suburbs. The entrance is usually quite discreet, and the exit is separated from the entrance (to avoid running into someone one might know). Basically, you rent a room by the night (listed as \"Stay\" or 宿泊 ",{"type":"''","value":["shukuhaku"]}," on the rate card, usually ¥6000-10,000), a couple of hours (\"Rest\" or 休憩 ",{"type":"''","value":["kyūkei"]},", around ¥3000), or off hours (\"No Time Service\"), which are usually weekday afternoons. Beware of service charges, peak hour surcharges and taxes, which can push your bill up by 25%.  Some will accept single guests, but most will not allow same-sex couples or obviously underaged guests. \n\nThey are generally clean, safe, and very private. Some have exotic themes: aquatics, sports, or Hello Kitty. As a traveller, rather than a typical client, you (usually) cannot check in, drop your bags, and go out exploring. Once you leave, that is it, so they are not as convenient as proper hotels. \"Stay\" rates also tend to start only after 10 PM, and overstaying may incur hefty additional \"Rest\" charges. Many rooms have simple food and drinks in a refrigerator, and often have somewhat high charges. Before entering a love hotel, it would be wise to take some food and drinks with you. The rooms often feature amenities such as jacuzzis, wild theme decoration, costumes, karaoke machines, vibrating beds, sex toy vending machines, and in some cases, video games. Most often, all toiletries (including condoms) are included. Sometimes the rooms have a book that acts as a log, where people record their tales and adventures for posterity. Popular love hotels may be entirely booked up in the cities on weekends.\n\nWhy are they everywhere? Consider the housing shortage that plagued post-war Japan for years, and the way people still live in extended families. If you are 28 years old and still live at home, do you really want to bring your mate back to your folks' house? If you are a married couple in a 40m² (400 ft²) apartment with two grade school children, do you really want to get down to it at home? Thus, there is the love hotel. They can be seedy, but mainly they are just practical and fulfil a social need.\n\nOne word of caution: there has been an increase in hidden cameras being planted in public and private spaces, including love hotels, either by other guests or even occasionally the hotel management. Videos of these supposed ",{"type":"''","value":["tousatsu"]}," (hidden camera) are popular in adult video stores, although many such videos are actually staged.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Business hotels"]},"\nThey are usually around ¥10,000 per night and have a convenient location (often near major train stations) as their major selling point, but rooms are usually unbelievably cramped. On the upside, you'll get a (tiny) en suite bathroom and, quite often, free Internet. Some major chains of cheaper business hotels include ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.tokyuhotels.co.jp\/en Tokyu Inn"]}]},", known for its generously sized rooms, and ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.toyoko-inn.com\/eng\/ Toyoko Inn"]}]},". The latter have a club card, which at ¥1500, can pay for itself on a single Sunday night.\n\nLocal, unadvertised business hotels, farther from major stations, can be significantly cheaper (double room from ¥5000\/night) and can be found in the phone book (which also tells prices), but you will need a Japanese-speaking assistant to help, or better yet, pre-book online. For two or more, the price can often compete with youth hostels if you share a twin or double room. Note that full payment is often expected on check-in, and check-out times are early (usually 10 AM) and non-negotiable unless you are willing to pay extra. At the very bottom end are dirt-cheap hotels in the labourers' districts of the major cities, such as Kamagasaki in Osaka, or Senju in Tokyo, where prices start from as little as ¥1500 for a tiny three-mat room that literally has only enough room to sleep. Walls and futons can be thin as well.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Inns"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[{"type":"''","value":["Ryokan"]}]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Togetsuan Entrance.JPG"],["thumb"],["A traditional ",{"type":"''","value":["ryokan"]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wakura Onsen"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ishikawa"]]}]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Togetsuan Room.JPG"],["thumb"],["A typical guest room in a ",{"type":"''","value":["ryokan"]}]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Kappatengoku Futon Large.JPG"],["thumb"],[{"type":"''","value":["Tatami"]}," mats and ",{"type":"''","value":["futon"]}," bedding"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:AzumaRyokan Breakfast 2.JPG"],["thumb"],[{"type":"''","value":["Ryokan"]}," breakfast.

There are two types: the small traditional-style one with wooden buildings, long verandahs, and gardens, and the more modern high-rise sort that are like luxury hotels with fancy public baths. \n\nSince some knowledge of Japanese mores and etiquette is required to visit one, many will hesitate to take non-Japanese guests (especially those who do not speak Japanese), but some cater specially to this group; sites like ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.japaneseguesthouses.com\/ Japanese Guest Houses"]}," list such ryokan and will help you book. A night at a ryokan ",{"type":"''","value":["for one"]}," with two meals starts at about ¥8000 and goes up into the stratosphere. ¥50,000 a night ",{"type":"''","value":["per person"]}," is not uncommon for some of the posher ones, such as the famous Kagaya ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wakura Onsen"]]}," near Kanazawa.\n\nRyokan usually operate on a fairly strict schedule and you will be expected to arrive by 5PM. On entry, take off your shoes and put on the slippers you will wear inside the house. After checking in you will be led to your room, simply but elegantly decorated and covered in ",{"type":"''","value":["tatami"]}," matting. Be sure to take off your slippers before stepping on tatami.\n\nBefore dinner you will be encouraged to take a bath — see ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Bathe"],["Bathe"]]}," for the full scoop. You will probably wish to change into your ",{"type":"''","value":["yukata"]}," bathrobe before bathing and it's a simple enough garment: just place the left lapel atop the right when closing it. (The other way, right-over-left, is a faux pas, as yukata are closed that way only for burial!) If the yukata provided are not big enough, simply ask the maid or the reception for ",{"type":"''","value":["tokudai"]}," (特大 \"outsize\"). Many ryokan also have colour-coded yukata depending on sex: pinkish tones for women and blue for men, for example.\n\nOnce you have bathed, dinner will be served in your room. In most ryokan dinner is very elaborately prepared and presented from carefully chosen seasonal ingredients; by all means ask if you are not sure how to eat a given item. The food in a good ryokan is a substantial part of the experience (and the bill), and is an excellent way to try some high-class Japanese cuisine. \n\nAfter you have finished you are free to head out into town; in hot spring towns it is perfectly normal to head out dressed only in ",{"type":"''","value":["yukata"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["geta"]}," clogs, although doing so as a foreigner may attract even more attention than usual. (Hint: wear underwear underneath.) Many ryokan have curfews, so make sure that you get back on time.\n\nWhen you return you will find that ",{"type":"''","value":["futon"]}," bedding has been rolled out for you on the tatami (a real Japanese futon is simply a mattress, not the low, flat bed often sold under the name in the West). While slightly harder than a Western bed, most people find sleeping on a futon very pleasant. Pillows may be remarkably hard, filled with buckwheat chaff.\n\nBreakfast in the morning is usually served communally in a dining hall at a fixed time, though the high-class places will again serve it in your room after the maid tidies away the bedding.  It's invariably Japanese style, meaning rice, miso soup and cold fish, although staff may agree to cook your raw egg on request.\n\nHigh-end ryokan are one of the few places in Japan that accept tips, but the ",{"type":"''","value":["kokorozuke"]}," system is the reverse of the usual: around ¥3000 is placed in an envelope and handed to the maid bringing you to your room at the very beginning of your stay, not the end.  While never expected (you'll get great service anyway), the money serves both as a token of appreciation and an apology of sorts for any difficulty caused by special requests (e.g. food allergies) or your inability to speak Japanese.\n\nA last word of warning: some establishments with the word \"ryokan\" in their name are not the luxurious variety at all but just ",{"type":"''","value":["minshuku"]}," (see below) in disguise. The price will tell you the type of lodging it is.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[{"type":"''","value":["Minshuku"]}]},"\n",{"type":"''","value":["Minshuku"]}," (民宿) are the ",{"type":"'''","value":["budget version of ryokan"]},": the overall experience is much the same but the food is simpler, dining is communal, bathrooms are shared, and guests are expected to lay out their own futon (although an exception is often made for foreigners). Consequently minshuku rates are lower, hovering around ¥5000 with two meals (一泊二食 ",{"type":"''","value":["ippaku-nishoku"]},"). Cheaper yet is a stay with no meals (素泊まり ",{"type":"''","value":["sudomari"]},"), which can go as low as ¥3000.\n\nMinshuku are more often found in the countryside, where virtually every hamlet or island, no matter how small or obscure, will have one.  The hardest part is often finding them, as they rarely advertise or show up in online booking engines, so asking the local tourist office is often the best way.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[{"type":"''","value":["Kokuminshukusha"]}]},"\n",{"type":"''","value":["Kokuminshukusha"]}," (国民宿舎), a mouthful that translates quite literally into \"people's lodges\", are ",{"type":"'''","value":["government-run guest houses"]},". They primarily provide subsidized holidays for government employees in remote scenic spots, but they are usually happy to accept paying guests. Both facilities and prices are usually more comparable to ryokan than minshuku standards; however, they are almost invariably large in size and can be rather impersonal. Popular ones need to be booked well in advance for peak seasons: sometimes almost a year in advance for New Year's and the like. \n\n",{"type":"====","value":[{"type":"''","value":["Shukubō"]}]},"\n: ",{"type":"''","value":["See also:"]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Meditation in Japan"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"''","value":["Shukubō"]}," (宿坊) are ",{"type":"'''","value":["lodgings for pilgrims"]},", usually (but not always) located within a Buddhist temple or Shinto shrine.

Hostels can be found throughout the country, so they are popular among budget travellers, especially students. Hostels typically range in price from ¥2,000 to ¥4,000. It can become more expensive if you opt for dinner and breakfast and are not a Hostelling International (HI) member, in which case the price for a single night may be over ¥5000. For HI members, a simple stay can cost as little as ¥1500 depending on location and season. As elsewhere, some are concrete cell blocks run like reform schools, while others are wonderful cottages in scenic spots. There are even a number of temples that run hostels as a sideline. Do some groundwork before choosing where to go, the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.jyh.or.jp\/english\/ Japan Youth Hostel"]}," page is a good place to start.

These establishments cater specifically towards foreigners and offer at least minimally furnished and usually shared apartments at reasonable prices, and without the hefty deposits and commissions of apartments (often up to 8 months rent) paid before moving in. It will almost certainly be cheaper than staying in a hotel for a month, and for those coming to Japan for the first time they are also great for networking and getting to know a few locals. The downside is that facilities are often shared and the transient population can mean poor maintenance and dodgy neighbors.\n\nGaijin houses are concentrated in Tokyo, but any other big city will have a few.

If the train is not likely to get crowded, you may even consider stretching out on the bench: remember to take off your shoes though. \n\nOf course, you have to obey the orders of the train staff, who tend to gently wake up people at the terminus, especially if the train is not going back.

To work in Japan, a foreigner who is not already a permanent resident must receive a job offer from a guarantor in Japan, and then apply for a working visa at an immigration office (if already in Japan) or an embassy or consulate (if abroad). It is illegal for foreigners to work in Japan on a tourist visa. Working visas are valid for a period of one to three years, and may be used to secure employment at any employer within the scope of activities designated on the visa (including employers other than the guarantor). Alternatively, if you have substantial funds, you may apply for an ",{"type":"'''","value":["investor visa"]},". This requires you to either invest a large sum of money in a local business, or start your own business in Japan by contributing a large amount of start-up capital and allows you to work for that particular company in a management capacity.

Pay is fairly good for young adults, but rather poor compared to a qualified educator already at work in most Western countries. Working conditions can also be quite strict compared to Western standards, and some companies have very bad reputations. An undergraduate degree or ESL accreditation is essential for most desirable positions. Interviews for English schools belonging to one of the larger chains would usually be held in the applicant's home country. Learning English is no longer quite as fashionable as it once was and the boom years are long since over. North American accents tend to be preferred. Recently there has been greater emphasis on children's education. Besides English, other foreign languages that are popular include Portuguese, French, Korean, Mandarin and Cantonese.\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.jetprogramme.org\/ JET Programme"]}]}," (Japan Exchange and Teaching) offers young university graduates a chance to teach in Japan. The program is run by the Japanese government but your employer would typically be a local Board of Education who assigns you to one or more public schools, often deep in the countryside. No Japanese skills or formal teaching qualifications are required and your airfare is provided. Pay is slightly better than the language schools and, unlike at such a school, if you have a serious problem with your employer you can appeal to the JET program people for help. The JET program also has a small number of positions for international relations or sports coordinators, although these require some Japanese ability. \n\nForeigners with postgraduate education may be able to find jobs teaching English (or even other subjects) at Japanese universities, which offer better pay and working conditions than the eikaiwa industry.\n\nQuite a few young women choose to work in the ",{"type":"'''","value":["hostess"]}," industry, where they entertain Japanese men over drinks in tiny bars known as ",{"type":"''","value":["sunakku"]}," (スナック) and are paid for their time. While pay can be good, visas for this line of work are difficult if not impossible to obtain and most work illegally. The nature of the work also carries its own risks, notably poor career prospects, alcoholism, smoking, potential problems from clients such as groping and lewd questions, and even harassment or worse, exemplified by the abduction and murder of hostess Lucie Blackman in 2000.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\n\nJapan is a country ",{"type":"'''","value":["obsessed with cleanliness"]}," and health hazards are few and far between.

Do as the Japanese do and use the tissue packets handed out free by advertisers at major train stations.\n\nThough it may be \"common sense\" for people who have lived in urban areas, many newcomers to Tokyo or Osaka are unfamiliar with life in an extremely congested metropolis, where almost everything they touch has been touched by hundreds of other people that same day. When newcomers to large Japanese cities take no precautions, they may be more susceptible to ordinary illnesses like the common cold. As in any other urban area, when in a large Japanese city like Tokyo or Osaka, wash your hands with soap and water as often as possible, especially after travelling on public transportation and before meals.\n\nBe sure to bring a small umbrella for the frequent rainy days. Don't rely too much on the weather forecasts, especially from a day or two ago. Then again, if you forget, you can always go into the nearest convenience store and pick one up for ¥500.\n\nJapan has its share of dirty areas. In cities, because of the sheer magnitude of traffic, the streets and curbs are just as dirty as anywhere. The obsession with cleanliness and removing shoes before entering someone's home makes sense because of the conditions of the outside world.\n\nIf you do become ill with a cold or other sickness, purchase a mouth covering, cloth surgical mask. You will find that people frequently wear these out on trains and on the job. This filters your sneezing and coughing so you do not transmit to others.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Passive smoking"]}," is a major health hazard in nearly all Japanese restaurants and public areas; this includes Multi-national food chains as well as local eateries. Non-smoking areas are not often provided and are sometimes substandard if they are.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Healthcare"]},"\n\nMedical facilities in Japan are on par with the West, and the better known hospitals are usually equipped with the most cutting edge medical technology. For Japanese citizens and residents, the cost of medical treatment is made affordable by the government's national health insurance system. However, for those not covered by it, the cost of medical treatment is expensive. While foreigners in Japan for an extended period (eg. those on Work or Student visas) are allowed access to the national health insurance system, it is not available to tourists on short visits, so be sure to have your travel insurance in order before your trip.\n\nMost Japanese doctors and nurses are unable to communicate in English.

Standard police procedure is to detain everybody first and to sort out things later. If anybody accuses you of anything even on the flimsiest grounds, you may be looking at an unpleasant extension to your vacation.\n\nJapan is exotic and mysterious; what seems strange and even appealing to you during daytime, can get obnoxious and annoying to you at night, especially with some booze running through your veins, so control your temper and alcohol level.

Women travelling alone should take care as they would in their home countries and never hitchhike alone.\n\nPickpocketing does sometimes happen: if you take your usual precautions in crowded places such as trains and at Narita Airport, you should be fine. Women and men on crowded rush-hour trains should be aware of the existence of male ",{"type":"''","value":["chikan"]}," (痴漢) and female ",{"type":"''","value":["chijo"]}," (痴女) or molesters. Be careful in these trains too, as you could be blamed for such occurrences, and possibly arrested. A lot of heavy drinking goes on in the evenings and occasionally drunks may be a nuisance, although alcohol-related violence is extremely rare. \n\nThe infamous ",{"type":"''","value":["yakuza"]}," (ヤクザ) (Japanese gangsters) may have earned a partly undeserved reputation of being a bunch of violent, psychopathic criminals due to their portrayal in various films. However, in reality, they almost never target people not already involved in organized crime. Don't bother them and they will not bother you.\n\nRed-light districts in large cities can be seedy although are rarely dangerous for visitors, but some smaller backstreet bars have been known to lay down exorbitant cover charges or drink prices. In some extreme cases, foreigners have reported being drugged at such establishments and then charged for as much as ¥700,000, or close to $7,000 for drinks that they do not remember ordering (notably in the Roppongi and Kabuki-cho districts of Tokyo). Never go into a place that is suggested by someone that you just met.\n\nNote that drug laws in Japan are stricter than those in many Western countries. The Japanese do not distinguish between hard and soft drugs, so possession of even personal-use quantities of soft drugs can land you a prison sentence of several years. Do not assume that just because you have a prescription from your home country that you can take it to Japan. If you have prescription drugs, check with the Japanese Embassy prior to your departure to find out whether or not your medicine is allowed in Japan. If it is illegal, they should also be able to give you information regarding what medicines you can buy in Japan to use in place of your prescription while you are there.\n\nPolice boxes (交番 ",{"type":"''","value":["kōban"]},") can be found on every other street corner. The police are generally helpful (although they rarely speak English), so ask if you get lost or have any trouble. They usually have a detailed map of the area around showing not only the difficult-to-understand numbering system but also the names of office or public buildings or other places that help to find your way.\n\nAlso, if you carry travel insurance, report any thefts or lost items at the ",{"type":"''","value":["kōban"]},".

To call for an ambulance or fire truck, dial 119 (a reversal of the US 911).

However, enforcement is lax, and the law specifically defines prostitution as \"sex in exchange for money\". In other words, if you pay for some other \"service\" and proceed to have sex by \"private agreement,\" the law does not recognize it as prostitution.

Such places are rare, however, and many Japanese claim that the prohibitions are due to perceived social incompatibility (for example, foreigners may not understand proper bathhouse etiquette) and not racism.\n\nBanks are often reluctant or unwilling to give cash advances to foreigners, stemming mainly from stereotypes of untrustworthiness.

Athletic shoes are acceptable, but keep them tied loosely so you can slip them off and on. Quality walking sandals (not flip-flops) and dress shoes are acceptable as well. Japanese culture sees shoes as being dirty, and before entering someone's house, certain restaurants, dressing rooms, and temples (to name a few), you ",{"type":"''","value":["must"]}," remove your shoes. The older generation of Japanese tend to group steps into two types: wooden (\"clean\") and concrete or stone (\"dirty\"). If you are going to be stepping on to wood, take your shoes off and place them to the side; there might even be a cubby hole for you to put your shoes in.\n\nAnd ",{"type":"'''","value":["don't forget socks,"]}," as it's generally more common to wear socks when in temples and houses, if you don't have slippers available. Japanese people are known for their love of socks, and sock stores selling high quality and colorful socks are found in most cities. Many of the socks sold in Japan are made in Japan. So, bring a pair of socks in your bag while you're sightseeing, if you aren't wearing them. Tights are acceptable for women. Footsies and under the ankle socks are handy, especially if you're going for the \"no socks\" look. \n\nShorts are uncommon, and generally only worn by children and teens. Though a common item in tourist summer apparel, instead try stylish jeans or slacks. In the summer, women wear sun dresses from trendy stores and breathable slacks made of fabrics like linen. Keep it stylish and comfortable. \n\nIn business situations, suits are standard; companies will let you know if you can or should wear casual dress. Suits are worn out for after work drinks and entertainment. \n\nFor clubbing and nights out, dress casual cool. Japanese women generally do not wear skin tight, super short dresses and cleavage is rarely shown, unless at the beach. Women dressed in tight short dresses and very sexy looks are often stereotyped as sex workers or escorts. When visiting Tokyo, for example, you will see young women and men dressed in subculture styles, such as Harajuku, Lolita, and punk. Japanese avoid making a scene of those who dress like a scene, but, casual glances are often enough for you feel like you're being checked out. \n\nIf you plan on visiting a hot spring or public bath, they're almost always used nude (except for rare mixed-gender baths). Although you may get some questioning looks, a bathing suit works. For men, speedos, trunks, or boardshorts. For women, a modest swimsuit is better than a skimpy bikini if you're visiting a hot spring or bath; for the beach, bikinis are okay. At public or private pools, you may have to wear a swimming cap; they may be provided for you, or you can bring your own.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Accessories"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Japan in the summer can be extremely warm and humid."]}," Japanese don't like visible sweat, and will frequently wipe sweat from their face with a colorful ",{"type":"'''","value":["handkerchief"]},", use a ",{"type":"'''","value":["fan"]}," (folding or flat) to keep themselves cool, or (for women) use ",{"type":"'''","value":["umbrellas"]}," to shade themselves during sunny weather.

In historic and tourism areas you will find shops selling beautiful fans and umbrellas. Both are affordable investments, though they can be pricey if you wish to have a real work of art. However, most Japanese utilize cheap but beautiful fans – many made in China – in their every day life, only to replace it when the fan becomes hard to close or worn. Cheap flat paper fans are often distributed for free at festivals and events. \n\nTraditional umbrellas can be bought at gift shops, and stylish umbrellas for rain and shine can be purchased at women's accessory and clothing stores throughout the country. Handkerchiefs are popular for both men or women. Some look like traditional cotton handkerchiefs you'd use to blow your nose, others are small towels. Japan's fabulous ",{"type":"''","value":["depāto"]}," (department stores) carry all colors, makes and models of these necessities.

Keep them in your purse or pocket, and wipe your brow when necessary.\n\nFunctional umbrellas – for keeping you dry, and nothing else – are often cheap plastic, and available at every convenience store for about ¥500.

Manga coffee shops (漫画喫茶 ",{"type":"''","value":["manga-kissa"]},") usually have Internet PCs as well. When you get tired of browsing the web, you can browse comic books, watch TV or a variety of movies-on-demand, or play video games. The cost is typically around ¥400\/hour, with free (non-alcoholic) drinks, and possibly more. Often they have special night fares: around ¥1,500 for the 4-5 hour period when no trains are running. Internet cafés can be a safe and inexpensive place to spend the night if you miss the last train.\n\nSome larger train stations and airports also have rental PCs to surf and send e-mail, usually about ¥100 (coin) for 10 minutes.\n\nA number of business hotels have Internet access available if you have your own computer, sometimes for free. In most cases, access is usually provided by a VDSL modem connected to the hotel telephone system. Some of the hotels that offer free Internet access do not include the rental for the modem in the \"free\" part of the service, so check before you use. Setting up your network interface for DHCP is usually all that is required to gain access to the Internet in such situations. Many also tend to have rental or free PC's available for hotel guests.\n\nWhen using public access PC's, the Alt-Shift keys pressed together typically switch between Japanese and Roman input methods. If you accidentally switch the input method or if the last person left the computer this way and you are looking to type in English, you can use this key combination to switch back to the Roman alphabet. There may also be a language-switch key at the top left of the keyboard - above the Tab key and to the right of the space bar. If you hit one by accident, just hit it again to switch back. For email, note that the @ key is usually on the right side of the keyboard, next to the 'P'.\n\nIt is also possible to find Wi-Fi \"hot spots\" around many large cities in Japan, especially near tech-related businesses and large corporate buildings with unsecured wireless networks (the Apple store in Ginza, Tokyo has a fast, open 802.11n connection).\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["3G Wireless Data"]}," is available, and if you have international data roaming, you should roam with no problem.
