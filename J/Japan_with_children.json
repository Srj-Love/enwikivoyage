Here are some tips for making your visit a bit easier.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nJapan has always been a hierarchical society where everything and everyone has its place, and traditionally, the place for young children to be is at home with their mother.  It's still common to keep babies at home for several months after birth, and strollers are a comparatively rare sight on the streets of Japan's cities.  If parents do take the kids out, they're expected to keep them in check: running around yelling in trains or restaurants is ",{"type":"''","value":["not"]}," acceptable and will earn you cold stares.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nIf you're flying to Japan with young children, it's worth paying a little extra for Japan's own airlines, Japan Airlines (JAL) ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.jal.co.jp\/en\/baby\/"]}," or All Nippon Airways (ANA), which are both extraordinarily kid-friendly.  For example, in addition to the usual slew of services (bassinets, infant meals etc), JAL offers a child seat rental service ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.jal.co.jp\/en\/baby\/child-seat.html"]},": just buy a seat for your child, and they'll install a plush deluxe child seat in it absolutely free, pre-adjusted to your child's size to boot.  Both airlines offer a special family check-in counter at Tokyo's ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Narita Airport"]]},", let you gate-check strollers, and will usually let you cut in the security line as well.  And regardless of which airline you fly, Narita has excellent kids' play areas, the one in Terminal 2 being particularly good.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nIn a nutshell, ",{"type":"''","value":["leave your giant stroller at home"]},", as they can be a nightmare to deal with.  City sidewalks are busy, temple and shrine paths are nearly invariably gravel, trains are crowded (impossibly so in rush hour), and while elevators are slowly being retrofitted everywhere, there are still many stations where you'll need to use the stairs or take *long* detours to use the one elevator available.  You can check ahead of time with Rakuraku Odekake's English service ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ecomo-rakuraku.jp\/rakuraku\/index?nextpage=TerminalSelectE.html"]},", and if you unexpectedly get stuck, station staff or passersby are happy to help if you ask.\n\nInstead, the Japanese prefer ",{"type":"'''","value":["baby carriers"]},", often for children as old as two, and lightweight collapsible ",{"type":"'''","value":["umbrella strollers"]}," that fit through normal ticket gates and can be carried up or down a flight of stairs one-handed in a pinch.  You may not even need to lug a stroller at all, since quite a few major attractions like Ueno Zoo and Tokyo Disneyland even rent out strollers for free or a nominal fee.\n\nOn trains and buses, children under 6 travel for free, although technically they're not supposed to sit in their own seat if adults are standing. (This rule is widely ignored.)  Children under 12 are half price, and you can get a special children's version of JR's Suica smart card (こども用Suica ",{"type":"''","value":["kodomo-yō suika"]},") that can be used pretty much anywhere and automatically deducts the children's fare at gates.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By local train"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:ChibamonoUF0.jpg"],["thumb"],["Is it a bird?

It still takes a combination of bad luck and bad timing to end up squished into one of those infamous trains where people are literally pushed on board, and you can usually see them coming: if the station is a whirling maelstrom of humanity even before the turnstiles, you might want to come back in an hour.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By long-distance train"]},"\nShinkansen bullet trains are generally well-equipped for babies, with breastfeeding booths and change tables in newer models.  The high-speed vibration can make some babies queasy, so feed them lightly or opt for newer models like the N700 on Tokyo-Osaka services if your kids are the type who get carsick easily.\n\nYou can only make seat reservations with a paid ticket, so if you have kids under 6, just use the unreserved cars.

Large centers, such as the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Round One"]}," chain ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.round1.co.jp\/"]},", often have additional activities such as karaoke, bowling, mini-bikes, mini-basketball, and other more space-consuming activities.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Purikura"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["image:Misaki Purikura Machine.jpg"],["thumb"],["A typical ",{"type":"''","value":["purikura"]}," machine"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Purikura"]}," (プリクラ, short for \"print club\" in English) is a Japanese-style photo booth where, once you have taken your photos, you can alter or decorate them on a digital screen with handwritten messages and wide variety of effects such as adding mustaches, accessories, sparkles, or backgrounds, before printing them out as stickers or photos or emailing them to yourself in digital form. This somewhat goofy form of entertainment is wildly popular with teenagers, who are known to decorate their cell phones and everything else with stickers and even keep books full of them, but they are quite popular and enjoyable for younger children and adults as well, and silly Japanese-style photos of you and your children can make great inexpensive souvenirs.

If your baby already expects food to have some taste, you'll probably have better luck bringing or making your own, or sharing suitable adult foods like rice porridge (お粥 ",{"type":"''","value":["okayu"]},", available in ready-to-eat packs).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Foodsample2.jpg"],["thumb"],["A typical ",{"type":"''","value":["okosama lunch"]}," with tomato rice, hamburger steak, deep-fried shrimp and omelette"]]},"\n\nMost Japanese restaurants do not cater to babies, with highchairs being virtually unknown, and the average Tokyo hole-in-the-wall won't even have the space to park a stroller.  The main exception is ",{"type":"'''","value":["family restaurants"]}," (ファミレス ",{"type":"''","value":["famiresu"]},") like Jonathan's ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.skylark.co.jp\/jonathan\/"]},", Royal Host ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.royalhost.jp"]}," and Denny's ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.dennys.jp\/dny\/index.html"]},", which can often be found near train stations and all of which offer a wide range of Japanese and Western food for both kids and adults at reasonable prices, with baby food on the menu, highchairs, etc.\n\nOnce your children reach an age where they can sit unrestrained and not make too much of a mess, things get a little easier.  Larger restaurants and most all chain outlets will often have \"child seats\" (こども椅子 ",{"type":"''","value":["kodomo-isu"]},"), which are like a cross between a highchair and a booster seat, and kids' menus (お子様ランチ ",{"type":"''","value":["okosama lunch"]},") featuring Japanese family favorites like fried rice wrapped in a thin omelette (オムライス ",{"type":"''","value":["omuraisu"]},"), hamburger steaks, deep-fried croquettes or mild Japanese curry, more often than not decorated with a cartoon character or arranged in a cute way.  Among the Japanese fast food chains, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.sukiya.jp\/ Sukiya"]}," makes a point of being family-friendly, complete with Happy Meal-style \"Suki Suki Sets\" with a box of juice and a toy.\n\nLarger Japanese restaurants may have private rooms (個室 ",{"type":"''","value":["koshitsu"]},"), often Japanese style (座敷 ",{"type":"''","value":["zashiki"]},") with tatami mats and low tables.  These are great with young kids, since they can romp around a bit without disturbing other guests, and they're usually free and available even to a single family, especially during early evening off peak hours.  Just make sure to request a non-smoking room (禁煙 ",{"type":"''","value":["kin'en"]},").\n\nThe fourth option is to do takeaway (持ち帰り ",{"type":"''","value":["mochikaeri"]},"), which is offered by a surprisingly wide range of restaurants, even at the high end of the gourmet spectrum: it's not uncommon for a Japanese salaryman to enjoy an expensive banquet on the company dime and bring back a sampling for the family.  There are also plenty of shops dedicated to cheap and tasty ",{"type":"''","value":["bentō"]}," (弁当) take-away meals, although opening hours are often limited (in the inner city, often weekday morning to lunchtime only).\n\nLast but not least, Japan's ubiquitous convenience stores are always handy in a pinch, offering ",{"type":"''","value":["onigiri"]}," rice balls, prepacked ",{"type":"''","value":["bentō"]}," meals, triangle sandwiches and other bakery goods, etc.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nAccommodation in Japan is usually charged per person, and once past the age of 12, children are considered adults when it comes to pricing.  Younger children are often free as long as they sleep in the same bed, but if you ask for an extra bed, you'll be charged for it.  Cribs for babies are usually free, although the age limit may be as low as 1.\n\nFinding rooms that can sleep four or more, much less with four separate beds, can be a real challenge, and most large families end up having to book two rooms.  Don't try to sneak in more people, as maximum occupancy rules are a part of the fire code and usually strictly enforced.\n\nIn traditional Japanese inns (",{"type":"''","value":["ryokan"]},"), beds aren't a problem since you're all sleeping on the ",{"type":"''","value":["tatami"]}," matting anyway.  However, since food is a big part of the ryokan experience, even small children will get charged extra for meals.  Not all ryokan accept young children as guests—and of those that do, not many are genuinely child-friendly. It pays to do your research.  On the upside, since meals are usually served in your room, they can be less stressful than eating out — just try not to spill the soy sauce all over the tatami!\n\nShort-stay serviced apartments are rare in Japan (bookings of one month plus are usually required), and apartments with more than one bedroom even more so.  A welcome exception is the Tokyu Stay ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.tokyustay.co.jp\/e\/"]}," chain, which rents out for as little as two days, has \"twin\" apartments that fit three, and come with basic cooking facilities and laundry\/dryer.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:ベビーチェアーの例.jpg"],["thumb"],["A typical \"baby chair\", pull it out to open"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Public toilets"]}," in Japan are free and ubiquitous, and larger train stations and tourist attractions nearly always have a large toilet equipped with a change table.
