The language has a large number of loanwords from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chinese phrasebook"],["Chinese"]]}," though the two are unrelated; Japanese may be distantly related to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Korean phrasebook"],["Korean"]]},", although the written form uses a combination of Katakana, Hiragana and Kanji characters which were all derived from Chinese characters. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Pronunciation guide"]},"\nJapanese is not a tonal language like Chinese or Thai, and is comparatively easy to pronounce. The vowels are pronounced virtually identical to the \"Italian way\" and there are very few consonants that do not exist in English. All syllables are to be pronounced equal in length. Long vowels take the length of two syllables. Combinations like ",{"type":"''","value":["kya"]}," are treated like one syllable and are the only occurrence of sliding vowels, all other syllables are to be pronounced rather separately.\n\nAlso avoid placing too much emphasis on particular words or syllables. Although Japanese does have a form of stress and intonation, it is significantly flatter than English. Word stress is much more subtle and neglecting it at this point should not interfere with meaning. Trying to keep your intonation flat will make your attempts to speak Japanese more comprehensible to local listeners. When asking questions, you can raise the tone at the end, as in English.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Vowels"]},"\nJapanese has only five basic vowels, but the distinction between short and long vowels is often important.  The sounds below are first given in romanized Japanese, then hiragana and finally katakana.\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["short vowels"]}," are:\n; a, あ, ア : like 'a' in \"p",{"type":"'''","value":["a"]},"lm\"\n; i, い, イ : like 'i' in \"mar",{"type":"'''","value":["i"]},"ne\"\n; u, う, ウ : like 'oo' in \"h",{"type":"'''","value":["oo"]},"p\", but short (best described as the sound said without rounded lips)\n; e, え, エ : like 'e' in \"s",{"type":"'''","value":["e"]},"t\"\n; o, お, オ : like 'o' in \"r",{"type":"'''","value":["o"]},"pe\", but less round\n\nNote that \"u\" is often weak at the end of syllables.  In particular, the common endings ",{"type":"''","value":["desu"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["masu"]}," are usually pronounced as ",{"type":"''","value":["des"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["mas"]}," respectively. Also, the kana \"do\" and \"to\" are sometimes pronounced with a weak \"o\".\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["long vowels"]}," are generally the same sound as the short vowels, only held approximate 60% longer. The long vowels, marked with a macron in this phrasebook, are:\n; ā, ああ, アー : like 'a' in \"f",{"type":"'''","value":["a"]},"ther\"\n; ii, いい, イー : like 'ee' in \"ch",{"type":"'''","value":["ee"]},"se\"\n; u, うう, ウー : like 'oo' in \"h",{"type":"'''","value":["oo"]},"p\"\n; ei, えい, エー : like the 'ay' in \"p",{"type":"'''","value":["ay"]},"\"\n; ō, おう, オー : stretch out the 'o' in \"s",{"type":"'''","value":["o"]},"ap\"\n\nAll descriptions above are approximations, it's best to practice with a native speaker.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Consonants"]},"\n\nWith the solitary exception of \"n\" (ん・ン), consonants in Japanese are always followed by a vowel to form a syllable. Consonants and vowels are not freely combinable as in English, see table on the right for all possible syllables and note irregularities like し ",{"type":"''","value":["shi"]}," or ふ ",{"type":"''","value":["fu"]},". Certain syllables can be marked with diacritics, which alters the pronunciation of the consonant part. The list below first gives the consonant part of the syllable in romanized Japanese, then the Japanese syllables that the sound occurs in first in Hiragana, then Katakana.\n\n; k in かきくけこ・カキクケコ : like 'k' in \"king\"\n; g in がぎぐげご・ガギグゲゴ : like 'g' in \"go\"\n; s in さすせそ・サスセソ : like 's' in \"sit\"\n; z in ざずぜぞ・ザズゼゾ : like 'z' in \"haze\"\n; t in たてと・タテト : like 't' in \"top\"\n; d in だでど・ダデド : like 'd' in \"dog\"\n; n in なにぬねの・ナニヌネノ : like 'n' in \"nice\"\n; h in はひへほ・ハヒヘホ : like 'h' in \"help\"\n; p in ぱぴぷぺぽ・パピプペポ : like 'p' in \"pig\"\n; b in ばびぶべぼ・バビブベボ : like 'b' in \"bed\"\n; m in まみむめも・マミムメモ : like 'm' in \"mother\"\n; y in やゆよ・ヤユヨ : like 'y' in \"yard\"\n; r in らりるれろ・ラリルレロ : no equivalent in English, a sound between 'l', 'r' and 'd', but close to a very soft 'r'\n; w in わ・ワ : like 'w' in \"wall\"\n\n; sh in し・シ : like 'sh' in \"sheep\"\n; j in じ・ジ : like 'j' in \"jar\"\n; ch in ち・チ : like 'ch' in \"touch\"\n; ts in つ・ツ : like 'ts' in \"hot soup\"\n; f in ふ・フ : no equivalent in English, somewhere between 'h' and 'f', but you will be understood if you pronouce it either way\n\n; n, ん, ン : short 'n', slides towards 'm' in some cases\n\n; っ・ッ (small ",{"type":"''","value":["tsu"]},") : glottal stop; the following consonant is prepared, held and stopped for the duration of one syllable.  For example, にっぽん ",{"type":"''","value":["nippon"]}," is pronounced \"nip-(pause)-pon\".  (Note that the double consonants ",{"type":"''","value":["nn, mm"]},", which are not written with っ, do not have this pause.)\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Examples"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"''","value":["kon'nichiwa"]}," → ",{"type":"''","value":["kon-nee-chee-wa"]}," (",{"type":"'''","value":["not"]}," ",{"type":"''","value":["kounneeCHEEua"]},")"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"''","value":["sumimasen"]}," → ",{"type":"''","value":["soo-mee-mah-sen"]}," (",{"type":"'''","value":["not"]}," ",{"type":"''","value":["sue my maysen"]},")"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"''","value":["onegai shimasu"]}," → ",{"type":"''","value":["oh-neh-gigh shee-mahss"]}," (",{"type":"'''","value":["not"]}," ",{"type":"''","value":["ouneeGAY SHYmessu"]},")"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Katakana"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Kana & Romaji Chart.svg"],["thumb"],["400px"],[{"type":"''","value":["Katakana"]}," chart"]]},"\n\nKatakana are used to write foreign and loanwords (except for those from Chinese, which are written in kanji) and are hence a good choice for travellers to learn. The katakana set of characters encompasses exactly the same sounds as hiragana; they only look different. The table on the left only reproduces the basic character set and diacritics (カ → ガ). Combinations (キャ) apply just as for hiragana. One additional sound though is ヴ ",{"type":"''","value":["vu"]}," and combinations like ヴェ ",{"type":"''","value":["ve"]}," based on it, accommodating additional foreign sounds.  Every once in a while you may spot additional ingenious combinations or use of diacritics.\n\nSince Japanese doesn't very well accommodate rapid successions of consonants, the katakana transcription can often only approximate the actual pronunciation of a foreign word. While some words like café (カフェ ",{"type":"''","value":["kafe"]},") can be represented quite gracefully, other words like beer (ビール ",{"type":"''","value":["bīru"]},") or rent-a-car (レンタカー ",{"type":"''","value":["rentakā"]},") seem slightly strange to the native English speaker. Nonetheless, many English expressions and concepts are used in everyday life, as are a number of German, French, Dutch and Portuguese loanwords. Oftentimes the exact meaning of a word has changed in Japanese (de: Arbeit → アルバイト ",{"type":"''","value":["arubaito"]}," is used only for part-time work) or a completely new meaning was invented (ワンマンカー ",{"type":"''","value":["wanmankā"]}," → \"one-man car\", trains and buses without an inspector, only ",{"type":"''","value":["one"]}," driver), but you can usually at least guess at the meaning.\n\nTo identify a katakana word, it's usually helpful to repeat it out loud a few times and to leave out superfluous vocals, especially the 'u' in ス ",{"type":"''","value":["su"]}," and 'o' in ト ",{"type":"''","value":["to"]},". That way ライス ",{"type":"''","value":["raisu"]}," quickly becomes \"rice\" and チケット ",{"type":"''","value":["chiketto"]}," becomes \"ticket\". Don't try too hard though, as sometimes original Japanese words are written in katakana as well, similar to the use of uppercase or italic letters in English. In addition, some words were not derived from English but from other languages such as German, French or Dutch.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Grammar"]},"\n\nJapanese sentence structure is very similar to that of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Korean phrasebook"],["Korean"]]},", so speakers of Korean will find many aspects of Japanese grammar familiar, and vice versa.\n\nAt its core, Japanese grammar is pretty simple, though sentence structures differ greatly from English. For instance, Japanese uses postpositions instead of prepositions (",{"type":"''","value":["Japan in"]}," and not ",{"type":"''","value":["in Japan"]},"). It has no gender, declensions or plurals. Nouns never conjugate while adjectives follow a generally standardised conjugation pattern. However, verbs have extensive conjugation patterns and much of Japanese lessons for foreign language learners is about getting these conjugations right. Verbs and adjectives also conjugate by politeness level though, and in a rather peculiar way.\n\nJapanese is a so called agglutinative language, meaning several morphemes which have purely grammatical functions are glued to the end of a word stem to express the grammatical function. The more the intended meaning differs from the basic form of the word, the more morphemes are glued together.\n\n",{"type":"{|","value":[["cellpadding=\"8\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"background-color: #EEE\""],["! colspan=5 | Japanese verb and adjective conjugation"],["|-"],["| rowspan=3 style=\"vertical-align: top; background-color: #CCC;\" | ",{"type":"'''","value":["stem"]},{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"見 ",{"type":"''","value":["mi"]}],["| ",{"type":"'''","value":["basic form"]},{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"見る ",{"type":"''","value":["miru"]},", \"to see\""],["| ",{"type":"'''","value":["polite basic form"]},{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"見ます ",{"type":"''","value":["mimasu"]},", \"to see\" (pol.)"],["| ",{"type":"'''","value":["negative form"]},{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"見ない ",{"type":"''","value":["minai"]},", \"to not see\""],["| ",{"type":"'''","value":["pol. neg. form"]},{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"見ません ",{"type":"''","value":["mimasen"]},", \"to not see\" (pol.)"],["|-"],["| ",{"type":"'''","value":["past tense"]},{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"見た ",{"type":"''","value":["mita"]},", \"seen\""],["| ",{"type":"'''","value":["pol. past tense"]},{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"見ました ",{"type":"''","value":["mimashita"]},", \"seen\" (pol.)"],["| ",{"type":"'''","value":["neg. past tense"]},{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"見なかった ",{"type":"''","value":["minakatta"]},", \"not seen\""],["| ",{"type":"'''","value":["pol. neg. past tense"]},{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"見ませんでした ",{"type":"''","value":["mimasendeshita"]},", \"not seen\" (pol.)"],["|-"],["| ",{"type":"'''","value":["possibility"]},{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"見える ",{"type":"''","value":["mieru"]},", \"can see\""],["| ",{"type":"'''","value":["pol. possibility"]},{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"見えます ",{"type":"''","value":["miemasu"]},", \"can see\" (pol.)"],["| ",{"type":"'''","value":["neg. possibility"]},{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"見えない ",{"type":"''","value":["mienai"]},", \"can not see\""],["|-"],["| style=\"vertical-align: top; background-color: #CCC;\" | ",{"type":"'''","value":["stem"]},{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"赤 ",{"type":"''","value":["aka"]}],["| ",{"type":"'''","value":["adjective"]},{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"赤い ",{"type":"''","value":["akai"]},", \"red\""],["| ",{"type":"'''","value":["negative form"]},{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"赤くない ",{"type":"''","value":["akakunai"]},", \"not red\""],["| ",{"type":"'''","value":["neg. past tense"]},{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"赤くなかった ",{"type":"''","value":["akakunakatta"]},", \"was not red\""]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Forming sentences"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["Particle pronunciation"],["The hiragana syllables '",{"type":"''","value":["は "]},"ha",{"type":"'''''","value":[", '",{"type":"''","value":["へ "]},"he"]}," and '",{"type":"''","value":["を "]},"wo",{"type":"'''''","value":[" are pronounced as "]},"wa",{"type":"'''''","value":[", "]},"e",{"type":"'''''","value":[" and "]},"o''''' respectively when used as a particle."]]},"\n\nJapanese grammar generally employs a subject-object-verb order, but is very modular and flexible since the grammatical meaning of a word is expressed by the morphemes glued to its end and special marker particles.

Even though kanji have since evolved dramatically and many have long since jettisoned any connection to the original concept, the meaning of some simple kanji can still be easily guessed at (see below).\n\nOne difficulty in reading Japanese lies often in the fact that a kanji can have several different pronunciations. The kanji 人 for example has the meaning of a person, and by itself it may be pronounced ",{"type":"''","value":["hito"]},". The kanji 大 means big (imagine a person with outstretched arms) and can be pronounced as ",{"type":"''","value":["dai"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["ō"]},". Together they form the word 大人 ",{"type":"''","value":["otona"]},", \"adult\" (lit. ",{"type":"''","value":["big person"]},"). In the word ",{"type":"{{","value":[["Lang"],["ja"],["外国人"]]}," ",{"type":"''","value":["gaikokujin"]}," (\"foreigner\", lit. ",{"type":"''","value":["outside country person"]},") the same kanji 人 is pronounced ",{"type":"''","value":["jin"]},". These pronunciations exist because a single kanji may be used to write one or more different words, or parts of words. These \"readings\" are normally categorized as either Sino-Japanese (",{"type":"{{","value":[["Lang"],["ja"],["音読み"]]}," ",{"type":"''","value":["onyomi"]},"); a Japanese approximation of the Chinese pronunciation of the character at the time it was introduced to Japanese, or native Japanese (",{"type":"{{","value":[["Lang"],["ja"],["訓読み"]]}," ",{"type":"''","value":["kunyomi"]},"); based on the pronunciation of a native Japanese word. Generally, ",{"type":"''","value":["kanji"]}," are read with their native Japanese reading when on their own (eg. ",{"type":"{{","value":[["Lang"],["ja"],["話"]]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["hanashi"]},") and with Sino-Japanese readings when part of compound words (eg. ",{"type":"{{","value":[["Lang"],["ja"],["電話"]]},", den",{"type":"'''","value":["wa"]},"), though there are many exceptions.\n\nWhile knowing Chinese will give one a huge advantage in tackling kanji, and someone who knows Chinese would generally be able to guess the meanings of new kanji with about 70% accuracy, one should still be careful. While most characters have similar meanings in both Japanese and Chinese, there are a few which have drastically different meanings.  For example, the word ",{"type":"{{","value":[["Lang"],["ja"],["手紙"]]}," \"hand paper\" means \"toilet paper\" (",{"type":"''","value":["shouzhi"]},") in China, but \"letter\" (",{"type":"''","value":["tegami"]},") in Japan.\n\nKanji are mixed with hiragana and katakana in everyday writing for historical reasons. Japan adopted the Chinese ",{"type":"''","value":["hanzi"]}," system, but found it difficult to impossible to express sound-based Japanese grammatical inflections with the meaning-based Chinese characters. Hence the sound-based hiragana characters have been invented and tacked onto the end of hanzi\/kanji characters. The katakana system was invented to express foreign and loan words. There are also several competing systems for rendering Japanese in the Latin alphabet, although the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hepburn_romanization Hepburn romanization"]}," system is the most common and is used on Wikivoyage as well.  Do not be surprised if you see these words romanized differently elsewhere.\n\nAlso note that there are many homophones in Japanese, i.e. words with different meanings that have the same prononciation (like \"there\", \"they're\" and \"their\"). This can be confusing even to native speakers, to the extent that words have to be explained with an alternative reading or need to be drawn. These words may also employ a pitch-accent system to distinguish them, which speakers of non-tonal languages may have difficulty learning to understand.\n\n",{"type":"{|","value":[["cellpadding=\"8\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"background-color: #EEE\""],["|-"],["| style=\"vertical-align: top; background-color: #CCC;\" | ",{"type":"'''''","value":["hashi"]}],["| 橋 \"bridge\""],["| 端 \"edge\""],["| 箸 \"chopsticks\""],["|-"],["| style=\"vertical-align: top; background-color: #CCC;\" | ",{"type":"'''''","value":["noboru"]}],["| 登る \"to climb\""],["| 昇る \"to ascend\""],["| 上る \"to go up\""]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Phrase list"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["Common signs"],["; 営業中 : Open\n; 準備中 : Closed\n; 入口 : Entrance\n; 出口 : Exit\n; 大・中・小 : Big \/ Middle \/ Small\n; 押 : Push\n; 引 : Pull\n; お手洗い, トイレ, 化粧室 : Toilet\n; 男 : Men\n; 女 : Women\n; 禁止 : Forbidden\n; 円 : Yen (ja: ",{"type":"''","value":["en"]},")"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Basics"]},"\n; Good afternoon. : こんにちは。 ",{"type":"''","value":["Konnichiwa."]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["kon-nee-chee-wah"]},")\n; How are you? : お元気ですか?
