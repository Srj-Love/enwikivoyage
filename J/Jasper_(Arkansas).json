[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"],["pgname=Jasper"]]},"\nScenic and quaint are two words that well describe Jasper. Located in Newton County, the small town is surrounded by the natural beauty where the nation's first national river, the Buffalo, begins to flow. More than one third of the county is owned by some government entity (National Park Service, U.S.D.A. Forest Service, State of Arkansas and county government). The area is packed with outdoor opportunities like hiking, canoeing, caving, rock climbing, fishing, hunting, mountain biking and horseback riding. A herd of about 450 elk roam the Buffalo River corridor at Boxley Valley, Steel Creek, Kyle's Landing, Erbie, Ozark, Pruitt, and even on private lands, and Newton County is known as the Elk Capital of Arkansas.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.arkansaselkcenter.com Hilary Jones Wildlife Museum & Elk Information Center"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/ozarkcafe.com Ozark Cafe"]}," is the most popular restaurant in Jasper and a must visit.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["36.008611"],["-93.185556"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Ozarks (Arkansas)"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Jasper, Arkansas"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North_America\/United_States\/Arkansas\/Localities\/J\/Jasper\/"]]}]
