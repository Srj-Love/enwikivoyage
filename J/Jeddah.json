Taxis are very inexpensive, with most 10 minute rides costing about SR10-20. There are two types of taxis: one is yellow and will have a sign that says, simply, TAXI. They are usually cheaper, but a little \"rougher\" on the inside and out and usually are not air conditioned. But they are very rare in Jeddah now. Also, most of them are now air-conditioned new cars. If you're looking for better quality, opt for the white \"Limousine\" taxis which are of better quality. There is a rule in KSA that a Limousine must not be older than 5 years. So, you find all the new cars in Limousines. Limousine taxis are about $1–3 more expensive. There are also \"unlicensed\" taxis, which are normal cars (usually a Toyota Camry) without the \"TAXI\" sign. Those taxis are cheaper than \"Limousines\" but are not legal. Police take strict actions against such taxis, so to avoid them. Normally they honk or flash lights when they see you standing in street (you can't recognize them as they're normal cars).\n\nIt can be cheaper to negotiate a fixed price than to use the meter. This requires some experience with Jeddah and its streets. Sometimes, a taxi driver will pretend to be \"lost\" as a pretext to turn on the meter or make you pay extra in exchange for his \"lost time\". Whatever the situation, never consent to pay more than the price you agreed on before the beginning of the ride. Also, some Saudi drivers ask for a higher price and don't treat clients very well, so look for Indian or Pakistani drivers.\n\nMany rental agencies like Avis or Budget will rent you a 2008 mid-size car for the price of SR100-140 per day. You'll also find a bargain when it comes to fuel, as Saudi Arabia has some of the cheapest petrol prices in the world. The streets are wide and signs are written in both Arabic and English.
