All of the locals know each other by first and last name because of the fact that there really aren't that many people here. Everybody is very friendly though. Any of the locals will strike up a conversation with you and help you with anything you need. It's a very relaxing town and it's a good place to get away from the city buzz.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By Plane"]},"\n\nThe two largest and nearest airports are the Portland International Jetport which are located in Portland, Maine. If you're flying from overseas, this is the place that you would land. Portland is about an hour and a half away from Jefferson. If you're flying from a more local place, or choose to take a smaller plane then you would fly into the Augusta State Airport. This is located in Augusta, Maine, which is only about a half hour away from Jefferson.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By Car"]},"\n\nThe best way to get into Jefferson is by car. If you fly in by plane, then you would either be flying into Augusta or Portland as was said above. If you're coming from Augusta, get on to Rt. 17 and follow that right until you get into Jefferson and hit the intersection of Rt. 17 and Rt. 32. Take Rt. 32 and if you follow that it will bring you to the center of the town. If you’re coming from Portland you would get on highway  295 North and follow that all the way up to Gardiner. You would then take that exit and get on to Rt. 32 which will take you right into Jefferson. \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By Boat"]},"\n\nMost of Jefferson is on Damariscotta Lake, so if you are coming from a surrounding town then by boat is the perfect way to get there. There are many different boat docks along the shores of Jefferson.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By Train"]},"\n\nThe Amtrak goes to both Portland and to Augusta, which means that you can get to these places from anywhere in the United States. Once you get in by train you would transfer to a car and drive into Jefferson.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nThe best way to get around Jefferson is by car. Everywhere you would want to go in Jefferson, you can do by car.\n\nThe only other means of travel that would get you around parts of Jefferson is by boat. Since it is on a lake, there are places you can go by shooting across the lake, but you can also get there by car.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nSince Jefferson is such a small town there really isn't much to see. The only thing worth while to \"see\" is just the scenery. Since it is located right on the lake it makes for some really nice sunrises and sunsets over the water. Also, since most of the town consists of woods, there are plenty of trees, flowers and ponds to explore if you are an outdoors person.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Damariscotta Lake State Beach"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=There is a state park beach located right in the middle of the town.

This beach also has quite a few seagulls which can be annoying at times.
