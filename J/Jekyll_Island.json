For over four decades in the late 1800s, the Island belonged exclusively to the renowned Jekyll Island Club - the winter retreat for some of the most elite families in America. The Morgans, Rockefellers, Vanderbilts, Pulitzers and several other families, reputed to hold over one-sixth of the world's wealth, established the Jekyll Island Club and built a group of large cottages along Jekyll Creek. Jekyll Island was sold to the state in 1947, five years after The Club closed.\n\nIt is now one of the largest ongoing restoration projects in the southeastern United States, and with over five miles of beaches and an unlimited number of outdoor activities, one of Georgia's most popular vacation destinations.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nThe only route on or off of Jekyll Island by automobile is by the Downing Musgrove Causeway (GA State Route 520). The Causeway can be accessed from Brunswick via US Highway 17 South and from I-95 by Exit 29 and travelling North on US Highway 17. Note: A fee is charged for each entry to Jekyll Island (currently $3.00 US) and annual passes are available.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Golf"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.jekyllisland.com\/what\/golf.html"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=The island offers many different courses with many different challenges for players of all abilities."]]},"  "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Fishing"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.georgiafishing.net"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Jekyll Island has an amplitude of fishing activities available to guests, from freshwater lake fishing, surf fishing off of the beach, or charter offshore trips.
