They are regarded as Australia's most outstanding caves and are amongst the best in the world.  Also the cave system has been dated to 340 million years, making them the oldest known caves on Earth.\n\nJenolan's main attractions are the ten spectacular caves that are open to the public, filled with astonishing limestone formations. The caves are open all year. They are very popular, receiving 250,000 visitors per year. In 2008 and 2009, Jenolan Caves won awards for their array of tours, activities and facilities.  Visitors can spend a couple of hours and see only 1 cave or stay for a week and have a thorough escape at Jenolan Caves.  During school holidays and on long weekends you may find Jenolan Caves crowded (and may have to park in the upper car park), but there will be many more cave tours as well, to cater                                for all the visitors.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By car "]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By car"]}," it will take you about 3 hours from Canberra and 2 hours and 40 minutes from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sydney"]]},". If you are arriving from the direction of Sydney, Katoomba and Lithgow, the last section of the road into the Jenolan Valley is very windy and narrow. Therefore, it is one way into Jenolan, 11:45AM-1:15PM everyday, to allow coaches to enter safely on the narrow road. Visitors can still leave Jenolan during these times - via the Oberon Road.\n\nCampervans are fine, but the road is unsuitable for caravans and trailers.  There are caravan parks in Lithgow and Oberon, where you can leave your trailer.\n\nNormally there is plenty of free parking.  However, on long weekends, such as Easter, allow extra travel time and book ahead.

It arrives at Jenolan in time to do an 11:30 cave tour, and you can also do one other tour in the afternoon before returning to Katoomba by 5.00pm.
