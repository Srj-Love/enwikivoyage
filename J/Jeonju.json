",{"type":"'''","value":["Bibimbap"]}," is one of the most famous Korean dishes native to this region.  \"Bibim\" means mixing and \"bap\" means rice. Served in the traditional brassware, it consists of rice with seasonal stir fried vegetables (carrot, bean sprout, radish, spinach, zucchini, bracken), seaweed (gim), and hot pepper paste (gochujang). It is also available in a hot stone bowl (dol sot), which slowly cooks the egg as you stir the ingredients together. The characteristic thing about Jeonju bibimbap is that it comes with Korean beef tartar (Yukhoe), Hwang Po Mook (a yellow jelly made from mung beans) and raw egg yolk (most of other regions in Korea serve with fried egg). The price for a serving of bibimbap is about ₩10,000.  Along with bibimbap, kongnamul gukbap (bean sprout soup with rice) is one of the most popular food in Jeonju.
