It is sometimes misleadingly referred to as the \"",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pompeii"]]}," of the Middle East\", referring to its size, extent of excavation and level of preservation (though Jerash was never buried by a volcano).\n\nJerash became an urban center during the 3rd century BC and a member of the federation of Greek cities known as the Decapolis (\"ten cities\" in Greek).  Jerash prospered during the 1st century BC as a result of its position on the incense and spice trade route from the Arabian Peninsula to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Syria"]]}," and the Mediterranean region.  Jerash was a favorite city of the Roman emporer, Hadrian, and reached its zenith in AD 130, flourishing economically and socially.  The city began to decline in the 3rd century, later becoming a Christian city under the rule of the Byzantine empire.  The Muslims took over in AD 635, but the final blow to the city was dealt by Baldwin II of Jerusalem in AD 1112 during the Crusades.\n\nModern Jerash sprawls to the east of the ruins, sharing the same city wall but little else.
