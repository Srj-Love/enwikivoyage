Jeri, as it is affectionately known, is the kind of idyllic place where many travelers end up deciding to stay for longer than they had originally planned.\n\nJericoacoara is a place removed from the hurried modern world of screeching sirens, maniac deadlines, traffic jams and endless lineups. A place where streets are paved with sand, where beaches stretch as far as the eye can see and where warm water marries with palm swaying breezes. Until about 20 years ago, Jericoacoara was still a secluded and simple fishing village. There were no roads, no electricity, no phones, no TV's, no newspapers, and money was rarely used.\n\nSince 1984, the area around Jericoacoara was declared Environmental Protection Area (APA) and became a National Park in 2002. This brought many building restrictions and tourism controls what help to preserve the area. Electricity arrived in the village and today, hot showers and air conditioning are no longer luxury articles. However, illumination of the streets is forbidden by local law.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By road"]},"\nMost visitors arrive from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fortaleza"]]},", changing vehicles in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jijoca"]]},", the nearest town to Jeri with paved roads.

They will take you to the fresh water lagoons for about R$ 30 per person.\n\nInnumerable fresh water pools, or lagoons, are located throughout the expanses of dunes that surround Jeri. Near the village there are only small pools mostly frequented by cows and horses. However, if you venture into the dunes, you will soon find lagoons and small rivers running as far as the eye can see in the \"valleys\" that lie between the dunes.  The bottom of these pools is sandy, which makes them excellent for swimming, wading, and water sports. Near constant winds make the lagoons a favorite spot for wind surfing. Because the sand constantly changes shape and alters the landscape, the locations of the pools change as well. To discover a favorite swimming spot in one of these lagoons is to carve out a unique and ephemeral natural experience that is only more beautiful for the fact that it can't be repeated next year.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Day-long buggy tours are offered to the village of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tatajuba"]]},", which had to be moved to escape invading sand dunes!
