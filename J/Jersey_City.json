Once a railroad hub, the rail lines of the country's great railroads, including the famed Pennsylvania Railroad, criss-crossed the city, bringing new immigrants into the American hinterland. Today, Jersey City is neither of these things. Decades of government mismanagement and disappointments had a profound effect on this once booming town. A fear of urban areas caused significant \"white flight\" to the suburbs in the middle of the 20th century; once affluent areas became centers of poverty and crime. Jersey City was a mirror of what was happening in New York City itself, although perhaps to a more significant and depressing degree.\n\nDuring the 1970s, immigrants began moving to Jersey City in droves, attracted by cheap real estate and a chance at experiencing the storied American dream. Today, these immigrants have helped to shape the city into a melting pot of the world's cultures and ethnicities. Nowhere in the state is there a city as diverse and as interesting as Jersey City in this respect.\n\nLater, the growing popularity of New York City in the 1990s had a significant impact on Jersey City, too. Old railyards along the waterfront became the sites of gleaming new office towers and high-rise condominiums. Brownstones further inland were fixed up by people moving back into the city. Jersey City's renaissance quickly began.\n\nThe city has gone through significant transformations over the course of its lifetime. And it's not over yet. High-rises continue to sprout up along the waterfront like weeds, attracting Manhattanites priced out of the real estate market there, while offering quick commutes to jobs in Downtown Manhattan and Midtown. Office towers continue to fill up with new tenants, including the backoffice functions of many New York City-based companies, earning it the moniker \"Wall Street West.\" (In fact, Jersey City has more Class \"A\" office space than downtown Pittsburgh or Atlanta.) New stores catering to Jersey City's new gentry continue to pop up almost weekly. It's a city in transition, and it's both exciting and frightening at the same time.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\n\nJersey City is about a 10-minute ride from ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Newark Liberty International Airport"]]}]}," (EWR), which is a major hub for United Airlines, and is one of the three airports serving the New York metropolitan area. A taxi to Jersey City from EWR will set you back about $40. If you don't have a lot of bags, consider taking the train. Catch AirTrain from your terminal to the Newark Airport train station. Take a New York-bound New Jersey Transit train one stop to Newark Penn Station, then cross the platform to catch the PATH to Jersey City. The AirTrain\/NJ Transit train is $7.75; PATH is $1.75.

If you park in a permit zone, your car may be booted by the Parking Authority, especially if you have out-of-state plates.)\n\nSince Jersey City is located at the western end of the Holland Tunnel, your best bet is to take any highway that leads directly to it. On the New Jersey side, this includes Interstate 78 (the Hudson County Extension of the New Jersey Turnpike), US 1-9, and Interstate 280. On the New York side, take the West Side Highway or Canal Street.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:PATH daytime.png"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Map of PATH system"]]},"\n\nThe PATH ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.panynj.gov\/CommutingTravel\/path\/html\/"]}," runs to Journal Square, Grove Street, Exchange Place, and Pavonia\/Newport in Jersey City with connections to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Newark (New Jersey)"],["Newark"]]},", Lower ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Manhattan"]]},", Midtown Manhattan, and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hoboken"]]},".

Also, they run to-and-fro between NYC and Journal Square, the fare being $2.50, which is much cheaper. These vans don't travel on a fixed schedule, but operate relatively frequently during the day (they come by every five minutes or so).  To get on board, flag the driver down.  To get off the bus, say \"next stop\" to the driver about a block or so before your desired stop.  Pay the driver as you leave the bus."]]},"\nThe best way to navigate within Jersey City, as a tourist, is likely by PATH or light rail. Most of the major sections of town are serviced by these forms of transport. The bus system is arcane, and even locals have difficulty understanding where buses go or how often they run.\n\nUnlike in Manhattan, taxis can be difficult to come by in Jersey City. You often have to call ahead to have one pick you up, although taxis are stationed at the Exchange Place, Grove Street and Journal Square PATH stations. Taxis in Jersey City can run either metered or unmetered (flat rate); the price is generally the same either way. If you are going unmetered, ask the price before getting into the taxi (or ask the dispatcher when you call ahead). Taxis are not cheap; a cab from Grove Street to Journal Square is about $10.\n\nZipcar is available in Jersey City.  Most locations are downtown, although there is also one location each for Liberty State Park and Journal Square.  Cars are within walking distance of all PATH stations in Jersey City as well as light rail stops between Newport and Liberty State Park.  Zipcar locations can also be found in neighboring Hoboken.  Generally, cars are readily available on weekdays.  Availability is not as certain on weekends, although some cars should be available if one is flexible and only needs the car for a few hours.\n\nMany streets have bike lanes.
