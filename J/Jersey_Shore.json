New Jersey continued to grow over the next couple hundred years while being fought over by the Dutch, Swedes, and English.  It was not until the 1900s that the New Jersey shore became prosperous and popular. In 1916, there was a deadly heat wave that hit the New Jersey area.  Thousands of people flocked to the shore for a break from the heat.  Unfortunately, between July 1 and July 12, 1916 there were a series of Shark Attacks along the coast, killing 4 people and injuring 1.  Although these attacks scared off some tourists, the New Jersey shore was already a favorite among many others.  During the Great Depression, the shore became an ideal vacation spot for both the rich and the poor.  While the poor usually traveled for day trips, the rich could relax in some of the shores most luxurious hotels.        \nIn more recent history, the New Jersey shore has become a popular destination for families and young adults looking for a great time during spring break.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["The 'Down The Shore' Myth"]},"\n\nSome Northern New Jerseyans and Philadelphians talk about going \"down the shore.\" The locals simply say they're going \"to the beach.\" \n\nThe natives tend to be extremely wary of the out-of-towners, or ",{"type":"''","value":["Bennies"]},", who invade their beaches, make too much noise, litter, destroy property, trample dunes, and otherwise damage the natural environment.
