A curiosity is that Jervis Bay Village, and the nearby beach area of Murrays Beach and parts of the surrounding bay are actually not in New South Wales at all. They are actually in a Commonwealth administered territory known as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jervis Bay Territory"]]}," - originally planned as a grand Pacific City and the port of the nation's capital. This vision was never realised, and most of the territory is designated as a national park. This anomaly may be noticed from the separate entrance fees that apply to the parks, and the fact that New South Wales parks passes aren't valid in Jervis Bay Territory.\n\nThe area is one of the most beautiful parts of the South Coast and is an extremely popular summer destination, making it very busy in peak periods.  Accommodation may be fully booked out months in advance of the Christmas\/New Year period. Opportunities exist to scuba dive, fish and engage in many other water sports, beach activities, walking, and hiking as well as appreciate the diverse flora and fauna. \n\nThe area has significant cultural and historic interest to both the Commonwealth and Aboriginal people of Australia. In 1995 parts of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Jervis Bay National Park"]}," were granted to the Aboriginal peoples and this land was redesignated ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Booderee National Park"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Booderee National Park"],["Booderee Botanic Gardens"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Booderee National Park"],["Booderee National Park and Booderee Botanic Gardens"]]}," occupy 403 hectares of the southern headland which forms the bay. The botanic gardens are a relatively small area within the park and were formerly known as the ",{"type":"''","value":["Jervis Bay Botanical Gardens"]},".\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Jervis Bay National Park"]}," occupies 4,857 hectares in a number of distinct areas to the west of the shoreline, notably around ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Huskisson"]]}," and the northern headland. Some include Jervis Bay shoreline. The Park has visitor facilities, areas of access for the disabled and picnic grounds with gas BBQ sites but no accommodation and camping is not permitted.\n:*",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au\/parks.nsf\/parkContent\/N0090 NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Jervis Bay Marine Park"]}," covers 100km of coast and adjacent waters, from Kinghorn Point in the north to Sussex Inlet in the south which encompasses Jervis Bay, Crookhaven Bight to the north and Wreck Bay to the south.
