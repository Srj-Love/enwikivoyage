According to locals the best time to experience Chiquitania nature is December - then the vegetation is lush and green. For arguably the best church experience consider visiting them during international baroque music festival (live worldwide baroque music and songs inside the churches).\n\nIf visiting the missions on public transport be aware that departure times can change and travel times are to be taken as rough estimates only as they depend on all kind of factors (road conditions, weather, mood of the driver,...). Guidebooks cannot be trusted for bus timetables and you don't want to be stuck for a day or two just waiting for the bus. Better check locally with bus companies and tourist information offices in Santa Cruz or San Ignacio for updated schedules.\n\nOn private transport all you need is a reasonably fine map.\n\nAccommodation is available in all of the mission settlements. The better hotels are found in Concepción and San Ignacio. Out of festival season finding a hotel room should not be a problem. If arriving late at night in a town you might want to book ahead though as some of the night guards could be reluctant to open in the middle of the night.\n\nThough the missions are interesting in themselves it could be worthwhile to do some research before your trip in order to time your visit with one of the many festivals in the towns.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe towns are situated in a remote part in eastern Bolivia. The main access point to the mission settlements is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Santa Cruz (city, Bolivia)"],["Santa Cruz"]]}," which is well connected by national and international flights and bus routes.\n\nAlternatively San José can be reached from Quijarro \/ ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Corumbá"]]}," (Brazil) on the \"death train\". \n\nA third option is to take a Santa Cruz bound bus from Trinidad and change in San Ramon for transport to San Javier. \n\nThere might be the odd bus running between San Ignacio and Cáceres in the northern ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pantanal"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go"]},"\nThe missions lie on a loop east of Santa Cruz and are connected by roads (about half paved and half rough) and a rail line between Santa Cruz and San José. \n\nThe following assumes Santa Cruz as a starting point.

Most of the daytime buses continue to Concepción, with at least one going on to San Ignacio (arrival after midnight). In addition there are various night buses from Santa Cruz to San Ignacio passing San Javier on the way. However with an arrival around midnight, these might not be interesting for travelers heading to San Javier.\n\nIt takes around 3 or 4 hours for 225 kilometers on a good paved road to San Javier. The church is just 50 meters off the main road.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["San Javier to Concepción"]},"\nMany buses from Santa Cruz pass San Javier around noon on their way to Concepción. In a bus it takes around 1.5 hours for 80 kilometers on a paved but winding road. Night buses heading east to Concepción pass San Javier around midnight. The church of Concepción is a few blocks from the bus drop off.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Concepción to San Ignacio"]},"\nSan Ignacio de Velasco is the main commercial center and transport hub in the region. It is a good base for a visit to the missions San Rafael, San Miguel and Santa Ana. \n\nMany night buses heading for San Ignacio pass Concepción around 2am. There is at least one bus leaving Concepción in the late afternoon.\n\nIt is 170 kilometers on a red sand track to San Ignacio. Count on 4 to 6 bumpy hours for this.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["To San Miguel, San Rafael, Santa Ana"]},"\nThese three missions are reasonably close to San Ignacio to be visited as a day trip or several day trips from there. Doing so you could take advantage of comparatively better facilities (hotels, transport, internet,...) in the capital of the province. Alternatively you might want to spend the night in a small town like Santa Ana to experience what life was like in times past.\n\nWhatever you do, unless you have your own car, you will have to solve the problem of getting there as public transport is rare beyond San Ignacio. In fact to see all three missions in one day on public transport from San Ignacio is probably impossible.\n\nThe three towns lie on a loop south of San Ignacio. In clock-wise direction you can go San Ignacio -> Santa Ana -> San Rafael -> San Miguel -> San Ignacio. The distance between neighbouring  towns is circa 40 kilometers or around 1 hour on bus.\n\nOption 1: To see the missions in a short time you could get a taxi in San Ignacio. A day trip to all three mission churches including waiting time can be had for around Bs400 and will take 5 or 6 hours.\n\nOption 2: On public transport you will likely spend the night in one or more of the three towns. From San Ignacio there are two bus connections a day to San Miguel. One leaves in the early morning and the other in the early afternoon. The morning bus continues to San Rafael. There might be occasional micros connecting the three towns to San Ignacio.\n\nOption 3: Combine buses with hitchhiking, but read \"Stay safe\" below first. There are no regular taxis in any of the three towns. So if you miss a bus, you might have to spend the night in whichever village you are in or hitchhike.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["San Ignacio to San José"]},"\nThere are one or two buses daily from San Ignacio to San José. These pass San Miguel and San Rafael on the way, so you could get on in any of these towns. (But check locally, as it could as well take the road via Santa Ana in which case it would not pass San Miguel!) It should take 5 hours or so for the 230 km trip on a sand track.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["San José to Santa Cruz"]},"\nFrom San José you can return to Santa Cruz by night bus in the dry season or train at any time of the year. There are at least two departures each day, both in the middle of the night taking 6 or 8 hours respectively.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nThe department of Santa Cruz in which the missions are located is one of the most prosperous areas of Bolivia. With the current political situation in Bolivia you should avoid large demonstrations in Santa Cruz. The towns on the mission circuit should be generally safe. Take the usual precautions against petty theft. With Brazil being very close there is some amount of contraband trade going on. Apart from the occasional shortage of gasoline, travelers should not be influenced by this. The tourist information in San Ignacio discourages hitchhiking on trucks for safety reasons.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]}," \nA trip to the Jesuit Missions of the Chiquitos can be combined with a visit to some of the best wildlife and nature destinations in South America.
