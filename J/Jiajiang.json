Additionally, from the nearest bus station to the actual Buddhas is about a ten or fifteen minute walk, although it's a pleasant enough walk.  The distance from the bus station is too long for a pedicab, so it's probably best to take a taxi to get there.  However, it's unlikely there'll be a taxi near the cliffs, so consider renting a taxi for an hour or two, it'll probably cost less than fifty kuai depending how well you bargain.\n\nReally while the cliffs are nice enough, there are certainly more impressive sights in the Sichuan area, and the inconvenience in getting there means it's probably worth skipping these cliffs altogether.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Jiajiang Museum of Handmade Paper"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Adjacent to the Thousand Buddha Cliff"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=Free in winter"],["content=Explaining and displaying the ancient local rice paper industry."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Thousand Buddha Cliff"],["alt=qiān fó yán"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Served by Bus 1"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=¥7"],["content=At least 163 ancient carvings of buddha carved into the riverside cliff along with temples and a hillside path through the woods.
