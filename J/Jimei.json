Jimei has the same bus system as Xiamen, so there are mostly modern buses that run often. However, there is almost no English signage, so it can be hard to get around if you can't read Chinese. \n\nIt can be harder to find a taxi in Jimei then on Xiamen Island, but they still exist. Few taxi drivers speak English, so if you don't speak mandarin it is a good idea to let your hotel\/hostel staff write down your destination in Chinese characters.\n\nMotorcycle taxis are common, and can be found waiting for customers at large bus stops and other important meeting places. They provide an exotic and cheap way of travelling through Jimei.
