It is located in the North-West of the province. In the South the city is flanked by the hills of The ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tai'an"]]}," massif, while the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Along the Yellow river"],["Yellow River"]]}," passes North of the city.\n\nJinan carries the nickname ",{"type":"'''","value":["City of Springs"]}," (泉城 ",{"type":"''","value":["quánchéng"]},") because of the many artesian wells that bubble up within the city limits. The water from these springs flows North towards the main landmark, Daming Lake (大明湖 ",{"type":"''","value":["dàmíng hú"]},"), and onwards to the Yellow River.\n\nWhile it doesn't always make the short list of tourists visiting China, there is certainly enough to be done in Jinan to warrant a couple days stay. It is also a perfect base for exploring the region, notably ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Qufu"]]},", the hometown of Confucius, and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mount Tai"]]},", the foremost of the sacred ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Five Great Mountains"]]}," known in Taoism.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nThe Yellow River basin was China's cultural centre during the Neolithic period, and so it comes as no surprise that the area around present day Jinan has been inhabited for over 4,000 years. The oldest finds in the region are from the Longshan culture, a Late Neolithic culture noted for its advanced black 'egg-shell pottery', sometimes as thin as a millimetre.\n\nFast forward past the Shang and Zhou dynasty. After the fall of the Zhou dynasty many independent states arose during a time known as the Spring and Autumn period. Eventually only a handful remained, striving for power during the Warring States period. During this era Jinan lay on the border of the state of Qi and the state of Lu. The great wall of Qi, to the East of Jinan, is a remnant of this age. It is the oldest Great Wall in China, and portions are accessible as open air museum. Lu (鲁） on the other hand was the home state of Confucius, and the character is still used as abbreviation for Shandong.\n\nIt was during the Han dynasty that Jinan became an important economic and cultural hub, and its role only became more prominent during the following dynasties. Some well known poets, painters and even a Han dynasty ruler all called Jinan their home.\n\nTwo events which both connected Jinan to the outside world in a new way spurred development and brought Jinan firmly into the modern age. The first was a natural evolution. In 1852 the Yellow River shifted it course, moving to the bedding of the Ji river from which Jinan derives its name. The Yellow River, being connected to the Grand Canal, now connected Jinan both to the Imperial capital in the North, and to agricultural areas in the South.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century the Germany Empire had established a concession in Qingdao on the Shandong coast, and a similar German area was built in what is now the area around the train station. The Germans built a railway connecting Jinan and Qingdao, this however was met with strong local resistance, which eventually led to the anti-foreign Boxer Rebellion. Despite all this the railway was opened for traffic in 1904, opening up Jinan to foreign trade.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nJinan is in basin region. The heat can be crushing in the summer when the breeze doesn't get down in the basin. Infamously hot in summer as it is one of the five furnaces of China.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nJinan is the hub of traffic for the region and province so you'll likely end up here if heading elsewhere in Shandong, notably ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Qingdao"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yantai"]]},". Most people will arrive by bus or train.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nYou can fly to Jinan, but the airport is located 40 km northeast of downtown.  A taxi will take an hour and cost about ¥100 (foreigners might be asked to pay a higher fixed price or be taken a detour).   There is a shuttle bus between the airport and downtown that runs hourly from 6 am to 5 pm. It takes just as long and costs ¥20. A subroute of bus 16 also goes to the airport.\n\nYou can find flights from most major cities with Shandong Airlines ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.shandongair.com\/"]}," being the major carrier.  (Shandong Airlines code-shares with Air China, so your ticket and check-in may well say Air China.)\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nFor the train, you may arrive at the main train station, north of town. Getting a taxi is chaotic and navigating the terminal is difficult so if you can get someone to meet you, it's advisable. The new Jinan West station is about 45 minutes by taxi from downtown. Several trains stop there and not at the main station.\n\nJinan is on the major line from Shanghai to Beijing so you can take the train. It's about 2.5 hours by fast train from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beijing"]]}," and 3.5 from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai"]]},".  There's a few overnight slower trains from Jinan to Shanghai.\n\nThere's plenty of transport outside the station: bus 83 stops nearby to take you downtown to more options, K51 takes you to Quancheng Square and Thousand Buddha Mountain.\n\nYou can now also take the new China High Speed Rail train that runs from Beijing to Shanghai and stops in Jinan. The trip from Beijing to Jinan takes approx. 1.5 hours and the trip from Shanghai to Jinan takes approx. 3.5 hours. The CRH train stops at the new Jinan West train station all the way on the western outskirts of the city. A taxi ride from there to center of city will take you over 30 minutes and there are also various bus routes which will take longer.\n\nSeveral travel agencies around the city sell train tickets for an additional ¥5.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nIt is very easy to get to Jinan with lots of buses running all day and some at night. Be sure to ask which station the bus will arrive in as there are two main ones, the long distance bus station (长途汽车站) and the train station bus station (客运汽车站).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nSeveral expressways connect to Jinan.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nFirst thing you have to consider is, do you really need to take the Bus? Taxis are the easiest options.  Other options are various motorcycles, and other vehicles that are either unsigned or a bit flimsy-looking.  These are hard to use as you have to negotiate not only the destination, but also the fare.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nBuses are often overcrowded.  Still, if you are interested in traveling as the locals do, hop on.\n\nBuses are ¥1, or ¥2 for air-conditioned.  Buses that begin with K are supposedly air-conditioned and even if the a\/c is off or not working, you are likely to get a seat on these buses as they are much less crowded than the ¥1 (no a\/c) buses. It should be noted though, that a line either is a K-line or not, same lines don't have K buses and non K buses operating on them, so mostly it is not possible to prefer either type without some walking being involved.\n\nMost busses with two digits serve the central city (which is tiny).  Three digit ones are either coming from or going to the suburbs (may be very far).  Bus stops are easily identifiable and bus numbers are written in the Western numbers both on the busses and at the bus stops.  The lists of stops for a given route are posted at every bus stop, but in Chinese only, although the beginning and end stations are written in pinyin.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nTaxis drivers do not speak English, and they will often not be able to read maps or your destination in pinyin.  So to be certain to reach your destination, make sure you have it written out in Chinese.  Price for shorter trips from ¥7.50.  It can be difficult to get a taxi between 7am-8am and 6pm-7pm. Many taxi drivers will try to cheat out-of-towners, foreigners and Chinese alike.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Hero Mountain (Yingxiongshan)"],["url="],["email="],["address=SE of downtown, at the curve of Ma'anshan Rd, near intersection of Jingshi Yi Rd"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=bus 32, 42, 75"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=free"],["content=Good for a climb and a stroll.

However, finding what you might like can be quite a challenge, as many restaurants don't have menus with pictures, and next to none have English menus. Some of the smaller places have a part of their menu printed into a large poster on the wall, with photos, and provides an easy way to get something you want.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Quanjude"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Down Heping Lu near Shan Da Lu"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=A good roast duck restaurant"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Dingy-looking restaurant street [Foshan Lu\/佛山路]"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Just off of Quancheng Lu"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Twists and turns for about 2 blocks.
