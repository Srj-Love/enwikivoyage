[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Mena-asia_default_banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Jincheng"]}," (晋城; ",{"type":"''","value":["Jìnchéng"]},") is a small city in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanxi"]]}," Province in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China"]]},". It is not a common tourist destination, but there are a few noteworthy destinations within Jincheng prefecture, outside the city. Like most Chinese cities its size English is not commonly spoken, even in places the traveler might expect such as large hotels and restaurants. In addition, most locals speak a local dialect or speak Chinese with a strong local accent. Travelers who speak standard Chinese will discover occasional difficulties, but should generally be able to communicate with locals most of the time. Jincheng is similar to other small cities in China. Expect stares, pointing, and shouts of \"hello\" and \"laowai\" if you do not appear to be Chinese.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nJincheng does not have a commercial airport although flights are available from nearby ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Changzhi"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zhengzhou"]]},". There is a train station, but travel by train to Jincheng is generally slower and less convenient than intercity bus.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" by taxi: Taxis in Jincheng usually run the meter so no negotiation is necessary with drivers. The meter starts at  ¥5. Do not expect the taxi drivers to speak either English or standard Chinese."]},{"type":"*","value":[" by bus: The city has many buses. Most are ¥1, except for special longer-distance buses which travel to and from the suburbs and neighboring towns and villages. These longer-distance city buses often cost ¥2."]},{"type":"*","value":[" by bicycle: There are still many bikes in Jincheng although they seem to be increasingly replaced with electric bicycles and scooters. The city is relatively flat so cycling is easy. On large streets bicycles ride in a separated one-way road parallel to the main road. On some streets the bicycles have been pushed into smaller bike lanes paved into the sidewalk. If you ride on such bike lanes note that the sidewalks are used for parking and there are often cars coming and going on the bike lane. Bicycles do not have the right of way. It is also common to see motorcycles driving the wrong way down the bike path, sometimes at great speed."]},{"type":"*","value":[" on foot: The city is small enough that those who enjoy a long walk should be able to travel across the city on foot in a reasonable amount of time. Be aware of the many hazards to pedestrians. Green pedestrian signals are not a guarantee that it is safe to cross. Cars turning right rarely slow down. Cars parked on the sidewalk and other obstacles will often force pedestrians onto the street. Drivers are accustomed to this, but do not expect to have the right of way as a pedestrian. Like many cities in China, manhole covers are often missing, so watch carefully where you step."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Lingchuan Red Maple"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Manghe Nature Reserve"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Yuhuang Temple"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Yibin Grand Hotel"],["alt=晋城颐宾大酒店"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Sunshine Hotel"],["alt=晋城阳光大酒店"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Lanhua Hotel"],["alt=山西兰花大酒店"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Jinnian Hotel"],["alt=晋城金辇大酒店"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Jincheng Grand Hotel"],["alt=晋城大酒店"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Pacific Hotel"],["alt=晋城太平洋大厦"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Shanxi"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Jincheng"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["35.49056"],["112.8483"]]}]
