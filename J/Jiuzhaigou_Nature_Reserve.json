Jiuzhaigou is at the northeastern end of this scenic area in the Min Shan mountains. It is part of the Aba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture. The main scenic area stretches 80 km (50 mi) long in the form of a letter Y comprising of three main valleys - Shuzheng, Rize  and Zechawa covering 720 km² (278 mi²) and offering stunning views of lakes, waterfalls, and mountains.  The name means \"Valley of Nine Villages\", derived from the 9 ancient Tibetan villages that call it home.  Its highest point is 4,700 m (15,420 ft) above sea level, with the main sightseeing areas between 1,980 m and 3,100 m (6,500-10,170 ft).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nThe remote region was inhabited by various Tibetan and Qiang peoples for centuries, but was not officially discovered by the government until 1972. Extensive logging took place until 1979, when the Chinese government banned such activities. The area was made into a national park in 1982. An Administration Bureau was established and the site officially opened to tourism in 1984. Layout of facilities and regulations were completed in 1987. The site was inscribed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1992 and a World Biosphere Reserve in 1997.\n\nIn 2007, over 2.5 million people visited Jiuzhaigou. The site averages 7,000 visits per day, with a publicly reported cap of 12,000 (however this is never enforced).  The desire to balance environmental protection and mass tourism has become an increasingly acute challenge for park management. Exploitation of natural resources for financial gain in the form of mass tourism is the utmost priority.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape, geology and hydrology"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Jiuzhaigou Pearl Waterfall 2005-08-21.jpeg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Pearl Waterfall"]]},"\n\nJiuzhaigou's landscape is made up of high-altitude karsts shaped by glacial, hydrological and tectonic activity. It lies on major fault lines on the diverging belt between the Tibetan Plateau and the Yangtze Plate, and earthquakes have also shaped the landscape. The rock strata is mostly made up of carbonate rocks such dolomite and tufa, as well as some sandstone and shales.\n\nThe valley includes the catchment area of three gullies (which due to their large size are often called valleys themselves), and is one of the sources of the Jialing River, part of the Yangtze River system. The area covering 720 km² (278 mi²) of the Minshan mountains provides the catchment for the water system of Jiuzhaigou. \n\nJiuzhaigou's best-known feature is its dozens of blue, green and turquoise-colored lakes.  Originating in glacial activity, they were dammed by rockfalls and other natural phenomena, then solidified by processes of carbonate deposition (travertine). Jiuzhaigou's water has a high concentration of calcium carbonate, making it so clear that the bottom is often visible even at high depths. The lakes vary in color and aspect according to their depths, residues, and surroundings.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\nThe park is the natural habitat for two of China’s most treasured endangered species – the Giant Panda and the Sichuan Golden Snub-Nosed Monkey (金丝猴). However, due to the park's size and the number of tourists, the chances of seeing them are slim. About 20 pandas reportedly live within the boundaries of the park. There is probably higher chance of seeing them in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zaru Valley"]]},", the valley dedicated to eco-tourism as of July 2009. In the main valleys you are more likely to see other creatures including birds (140 species have been recorded here), insects and fish.\n\nDespite all the lakes in the park, Jiuzhaigou is amazingly free of mosquitoes.\n\nNearly 300 km² (115 mi²) of the core scenic area is covered by virgin mixed forests. The flora changes greatly with altitude.  In the lower regions of the valley, grasses and reeds abound.  These are quickly replaced by bamboo forests which in turn give way to deciduous trees and conifers at the upper end of the valley. Beyond them the rocky slopes and snow-capped peaks of the Min Shan range dominate the view.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nThe scenic area of the park is at a height of between 2,000 and 3,000 m (6,562-9,843 ft).  In summer the winds blow predominantly from the south and in the winter from the north.  The summer months are most pleasant time to visit the park.

Although Jiuzhaigou is only around 350km from Mianyang, and 460km from Chengdu (as the crow flies), the journey takes between 8 and 11 hours due to the winding mountain roads through some spectacular scenery along the valleys of the Fu or Min rivers.  Many tour companies break the journey into two components with overnight stops either at Mianyang or Maoxian.\n\nImportant note: following the Sichuan earthquake of 12 May 2008, the road to Juizhaigou via Wenchuan and Maoxian is not recommended. The road between Chengdu and Wenchuan is excellent but Mao Xian - Chuan Zhu Si is undergoing landslide prevention and road widening works. As of September 2009, the bus from Chengdu to Jiuzhaigou can take up to 17 hours (!) although this is the exception rather than the norm. The regular time is 7-11 hours now that some of this work has been completed. During National Week 2009 the Chinese government was not allowing foreigners to travel to jiuzhaigou by road in any form. These restrictions were lifted again as of 10 October 2009.\n\nIf the area has experienced heavy rain, the mountain road to Jiuzhaigou may be closed. This can mean that there may be a delay as traffic backs up to wait for the road to reopen.

As of July 2013 direct flights are also available from Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai, Xi'an and Hangzhou on various airlines. Jiuhuang airport is about a 1.5-hour drive from the park entrance. This can be done by taxi or mini-bus. Taxi costs 200 RMB. The airport shuttle bus costs 45 RMB per person, the counter is right after the baggage reclaim. Min. number of pax for the bus is 10, but if there are at least 4 pax turning up at the same time, they might pool all of them into a single taxi for the price of the shuttle bus.\n\nMost visitors access Juizhaigou by road.\n\nFrom Mianyang an early morning start gets you to Jiuzhaigou township in time for dinner and the Tibetan cultural show (¥120-320). The route initially follows the deep valley of the Fu river then over Longmen shan (Dragon gate mountain) to Qingchuan and Wenxian before reaching Jiuzhaigou County Town nestled in the valley of the Baishui river. The mountain and river views make even the journey a worth while tourist experience.\n\nPublic Bus services are available from the Xinnanmen and Chadianzi bus stations in Chengdu to Jiuzhaigou with 2 or 3 departures from each station daily depending on demand.

There are also mini-buses (they really are minivans) to the most popular tourist destinations in the Jiuzhaigou region.  Car Rentals are also available and range from ¥500-900per day.   \n\nPerhaps the easiest way to get around without a tour guide is using one of the \"self service travel websites\" that are really popular with young Chinese tourists who are not looking to travel with a tour group.  Unfortunately for people who cannot search the web using Chinese characters (pin yin does not work very well) these sites are near impossible to find.  On these sites you can buy tickets to local cultural events, arrange for pick up service, rent cars, arrange for tour guides, and finding Tibetan local host families for a cultural experience.  However, they are extremely hard to find with names that are usually just strings of letters and numbers like cq966.com.  The mentioned website is actually ran by locals attached to Chang Qing （长青）hotel - one of the two hotels (other is the Sheraton) with the most credibility among tour guides within Jiuzhaigou proper.  You can email these websites in English or contact them through MSN and they will be able to respond.

However, with a bus pass you can take a bus to all of the sites within the park. Your pass gives you access to an efficient  hop-on  hop-off  bus transport system.  Every few minutes a bus will come to a site to pick up passengers. The buses are frequent and sometimes crowded during the peak season,  running from early morning until the park closes. Don’t miss the last bus or you must walk out!  When entering the park you will be herded effectively and politely into one of the many queues waiting for  transport. Once in the system you are a free to move within the park and see whatever you want. An effective way to use the system is to take the bus to the head of Rize valley and walk back towards the entrance and Administration building. Walking is a great option in the park, as wooden-plank trails wind through the lakes and forests. It is best to combine walking with taking the bus as the park is quite large and you won't be able to cover enough ground on foot.

The altitude changes within the valley to create continual variations of flora, which give each lake and waterfall a unique quality.\n\nAlthough Jiuzhaigou is a great place to visit at any time of the year Spring and autumn are best. Winter provides many magnificent sights with frozen lakes and waterfalls, but the day temperatures are very low and accessibility by road is neither easy nor guarantee-able. Summers can be slightly crowded with beautiful sunshine in the early parts and it often rains in July and August. The fresh air and lack of humidity make it a great break from the city. Autumn is, in many opinions, the pick of the seasons. In late September through October to early November  the colour contrasts of red and gold leaves set against the greys of the Bamboo forest and the dark greens of the conifers provide the perfect backdrop to the blue, cyan and vivid greens lakes.\n\nJiuzhaigou has some 114 Lakes and waterfalls.
