[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["S-amer africa default banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Joal-Fadiouth"]}," is a city in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cap Vert-Thies"]]}," region on the western coast of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Senegal"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nJoal-Fadiout rests on the Petite Cote 35km south of Mbour. The largest artisanal fishing port in West Africa resides here and provides a spectacular sight for the way fishing was done before modern machinery. While the city is usually referred to as just Joal, Fadiout is a unique and special part of the city. It is an island made primarily of sea shells and is home to most of the local Sereer’s and Catholic’s. Lastly, Joal-Fadiout is home to Senegal’s first president, Leopold Senghor in whom the city takes much pride.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nThe tourist season starts in November and goes until around April as the weather during that time is dry and pleasant. From May to October, the weather is typically hotter and once the rains start in July, very humid. Because Joal is located on the coast, there is usually a pleasant breeze all the time which makes Joal cooler than most places in Senegal.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Respect"]},"\nThe Senegalese are a very friendly and hospitable group of people. In order to continue receiving their hospital, please follow the actions listed below.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Always greet and ask how their day is going."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Never use your left hand to shake hands or give something to someone. By doing so, you would be showing a lack of respect towards the locals. "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Never tell a Senegalese that he\/she is lying even if they are."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Always ask for permission before taking pictures of the locals."]},"\nAs a tourist, you will be asked by many people to give out money, and even if you want to, ",{"type":"'''","value":["PLEASE DO NOT GIVE OUT MONEY!!!"]}," By giving the locals money, you would be making the locals dependent on foreign aid instead of them working for themselves for their own livelihood. The reason the locals in Senegal always ask tourists for money is because the tourists had done so in the past. In order to break the cycle, tourists should stop giving out money.\n\nIf you really want to donate something to the community, please go to the local schools and give school supplies to the principal who will then distribute the supplies appropriately.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nWhen departing from Dakar with your own vehicle, taking the route national from Dakar to Mbour, then from Mbour to Joal is very straight forward and on good roads.\n\nUsing public transport, from Dakar, the best way is taking a sept place in garage pompiere for 2,100 CFA straight to Joal. If leaving from Mbour, the sept place ride will cost 750 CFA. Luggage is not included with the price and will need to be haggled for. Usually large and heavy bags will cost 500-750 CFA each from Dakar to Joal.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nJoal is a long town that hugs the coast. Walking the width of the town takes no more than 10-15 minutes while walking from end to end would take around an hour. The main road in Joal is where everything can be found and taxi's called \"klando's\" can be flagged down on the road and taken anywhere along that road for 100 CFA. The klando route is the fishing port to Fadiout on the main road. If one would like to go to a special destination, most klando drivers are more than happy to negotiate a price to go there.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nIn Joal there are a couple very interesting things to see. First, upon entering Joal, there is the artisanal fishing port which is a magnificent sight during the mornings and evenings when most boats bring in their catches. The organized chaos makes for an interesting visit along with the ability to purchase different types of fresh fish. The best hours to visit are around 9 am and 6 pm when fishermen are coming back.\n\nAnother sight is the house where Leopold Senghor grew up in. As Senghor is revered for being the first president who set a tone for stability, it is a great visit to make. The house contains a bit of history as to what Joal was like during the colonial times and a family history of the Senghor family.\n\nFadiout is the main attraction in Joal where tour operators in Senegal stop on their circuits. It is recommended to take a tour as the guides are professional, but it can be done alone. First off it has a large, well built bridge leading to the city and another to their cemetery. The island itself is build primarily on sea shells from years and years of harvesting. The cemetery also is covered in sea shells and is a unique visit as both Muslims and Christians are buried near each other which is a rare occurrence in the world. Fadiout also has some granaries that are kept between the cemetery and the city that is now unused, but is now a World Heritage site.\n\nLastly, just outside of Joal, towards Palmarin, is the grand baobab that is rumored to be the biggest in Senegal. It's quite large and can even be crawled inside though watch out for the bats.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat and Drink"]},"\nThere are many places to eat in Joal from street sandwiches and rice shacks to hotel restaurants.
