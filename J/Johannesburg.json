The majority of the population is formed by South Africa's black residents who mostly live in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Johannesburg\/Soweto"],["Soweto"]]},", while white residents amount to 500,000 (although the number is likely to be higher). There are also around 300,000 residents of other descent. Unlike other South African cities, no language group dominates, although English is the established lingua franca.\n\nThe city is the economic hub of South Africa, and increasingly for the rest of Africa. Although estimates vary, about 10% of sub-Saharan Africa's GDP is generated in Johannesburg. Yet the city's wealth is unequally distributed among its inhabitants causing the city to have, within its own borders, living conditions varying from first world standards to third world conditions. The contrast between rich and poor has led to one of the highest crime rates in the world. The more affluent tend to live in houses with a high level of security by western standards, whilst the less affluent live in less desirable housing conditions. Don't avoid Johannesburg because of its crime however, since it is perfectly possible to have a safe and enjoyable stay if precautions are taken. Many South Africans choose to live here over other, safer parts of the country.\n\nThere are many things that are unique to Johannesburg. It features a distinct street entrepreneurship, and motorists can buy things from vendors selling goods at traffic lights, as in many other developing-world cities. This includes food, umbrellas, soccer balls, cellular phone accessories and many other goods. Barber shops consisting of nothing but a chair and an enthusiastic barber can be found on the sides of roads, although they tend to specialize in African rather than Caucasian hair. Mine dumps can also be seen throughout the city and are a reminder of the city's legacy of gold mining. These dumps are fast disappearing as new gold extraction techniques have made it profitable for mining companies to reprocess these dumps.\n\nWith around 6 million trees, Johannesburg is most likely the world's largest man-made urban forest. The city is certainly one of the greenest in the world, considering that the natural landscape is savannah.\n\nThe weather is generally regarded as excellent; temperatures reach the mid-30s Celsius (95°F) in the summer months (Dec-Feb) with little to no wind and with occasional, spectacular afternoon thunderstorms. Temperatures in winter can drop into single digits but snow is extremely rare.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Orientation"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:South Africa-Johannesburg Towers01.png"],["thumb"],["175px"],["Johannesburg towers"]]},"\n\nBy far the easiest way to find your bearings in Johannesburg is by finding the two telecommunication towers on the horizon.

When flying out some international flights may have their check-in in Terminal B, but will still leave from Terminal A. The two terminals are adjacent to each other and a 5 minute indoor walk between the two.\n\nThe airport is located to the east of Johannesburg, 24 km (15 mi) from the city center.  There is a highspeed train to Sandton and Pretoria (see below) from the airport. If you are taking a taxi, keep walking straight until you exit the building and then turn left until you see a long line of taxis (mainly Mercedes) with yellow TAXI signs on their roof. These are licensed taxis with meters (tell the driver the address and insist on using the meter before you get in the car). Do NOT go with anyone who approaches you offering a taxi while you are inside the airport building, these are unlicensed touts, and you'll end up paying more. If you are staying in a hotel, try to get the hotel to send a shuttle to pick you up (though it may cost).\n\nFor getting money try to avoid the many banks and money changers on the left of the arrivals door: They display the exchange rates but don't indicate their excessive \"commissions\" that can reduce what you actually get by 10% or more - this is the case at all banks and bureaux de change in South Africa.

The Gautrain (a speed train not part of the metro system) is a good, clean and safe way to jump fast between the airport, Malboro, Midrand, Rosebank, Pretoria and Centurion. There are buses and minicabs on the streets, but there tends to be no designated stops, so buses may be flagged down on main roads such as Oxford street and Jan Smuts. They can be unsafe, but larger double decker metro bus are easy to use all along Oxford, starting in Ghandi Square, going through Killarney, Rosebank, Illovo, Sandton, Rivonia and Sunninghill (bus no. 5C and 5D). The other bus alternatives, are orange putco buses, coming more regularly than the metro buses and its slightly more expensive. Lastly there are the Gautrain feeder buses connected to the Gautrain, these have quite extensive routes from each station - these can be found easily on the gautrain website or mobi site. The problem is that buses are quite problematic on weekends and public holidays, Gautrain buses do not run, Metro buses have two route runs, and putco buses are at a complete halt. This is when the train would be a good alternative, or rent a car.\n\nYou enter where you want (make sure you know where the taxi is going, and generally locals use specific handsignals to ensure the correctly destined taxi stops) and it stops where you want along the fixed route. Generally, it is ill advised to make use of minibus taxi's unless accompanied by locals. Minibus taxi drivers often say whatever they need to secure a fare. Renting a car will give you the best flexibility and opportunity to tour the city, however driving is fast paced, but by no means difficult as long as you stay alert. Heavy traffic into Sandton in the morning (6:30 to 9:00) from all directions leading towards Sandton and in the afternoon all routes leading out of Sandton (15:30 to 18:30) in all directions could delay your journey by up to 2 h, so plan accordingly.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Car rental"]},"\nRenting a car is your best option if you are a confident driver as the city's public transport is very, very limited. It is worth buying a good road map of Johannesburg, using a GPS (available when you rent a car) and planning your trips carefully before setting out. The city large and somewhat poorly signposted. Make sure to be exceptionally clear with your rental agency what types of things are covered by their insurance plans. The phrase ``Full coverage'' doesn't necessarily mean full coverage. Traffic can be aggressive, and minibus taxis in particular often defy the rules of the road.\n\nLike any big city, there are some areas of Johannesburg that you don't want to stray into if you look like a tourist or don't have enough fuel to get out of. Ask advice. If in doubt, stop at a police station and ask them for directions.\n\nFrom the airport: Stay on the freeway between the airport and Sandton, and don't divert through the townships and Alexandra on London Road. A GPS following the fastest route will usually divert around the townships, but it pays to know where you are going. (If you are coming from the airport and you are afraid of getting this wrong, carry on past Marlboro Drive with the N3 (which becomes the N1) until you reach Rivonia road. Then turn left\/south and this will take you straight into Sandton, bypassing any townships.)\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Europcar Car Hire"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.europcar.co.za"],["email=info@europcar.co.za"],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=(011) 883-4352"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Car rentals in Johannesburg and Johannesburg Airport."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Pace Car Rental"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.pacecarrental.co.za"],["email=info@pacecarrental.co.za.co.za"],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=(011) 262 5500"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Long-term car rental in Johannesburg and Sandton, Cars, Bakkies and Minibuses."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Rent a Wreck"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/rentawreck.co.za"],["email=info@rentawreck.co.za"],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=011-402-5150\/1\/2"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Very cheap car rental.

Like many other cities with a crime problem, some places are quite safe while others can be quite dangerous, and, in some places, crime may depend on whether it is day or night. Armed security guards (not necessarily the police) are a common sight in the city. Ask local people (hotel staff, police) what to do.\n\nJohannesburg earned its lawless reputation during the 1980s when the apartheid regime was collapsing. Things really went downhill in the early 1990s - and many (white) South Africans have traumatic memories of this period – memories which flavour their security advice for the city even today.  However things have improved enormously since those days, although the advice you may receive from some Johannesburg residents may not match today’s reality.  Nevertheless you should keep security in mind and tourists must remain alert at all times when in unfamiliar surroundings.\n\nWhen on the street (this doesn’t apply to shopping malls and other secure environments) best general advice is to try your best to look like a local and to avoid displaying any form of wealth. Keep your cellphone hidden, leave your jewellery at the hotel and avoid carrying backpacks, daypacks, cameras or purses. Use a cheap plastic bag, keep your values at the hotel and take only the amount of money that you really need. Never use a purse, but put loose coins or notes in your pockets.\n\nIf you fall victim to robbery, it is best to cooperate with your assailants, hand over your valuables, do not attempt to negotiate, do not look them in the eye, and do not fight back. Then report the robbery to the police.\n\nAbove all, use your common sense! If someone insists that you follow them to get somewhere \/ do something, approach with extreme caution. Don't pay someone for something unless you have the goods in hand. When approached by beggars, it is generally a good idea to politely but firmly deny them.\n\nFinally, keep things in perspective, Johannesburg has a partly-deserved bad reputation for crime, but most victims are local residents living in the townships. The overwhelming majority of visitors have a trouble-free stay.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Shopping malls"]},"\nShopping malls in Johannesburg are as safe as shopping malls anywhere else in the world, with pick pocketing being the only risk, though a small one.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Central Business District"]},"\n\nThe central business district is busy during the day, and parts of it are pretty scruffy, but there are lots of police and private security around.  The area is largely deserted at night, during weekends, and on holidays. There are many interesting things to do in the CBD, just plan where you are going to park and what you are going to visit beforehand, and never wander around aimlessly.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Northern suburbs"]},"\n\nPedestrians are rare, but you should be fine walking from your guesthouse to a local restaurant or shopping mall; however, distances can be large, which makes driving or taking a taxi better options.

If you must walk at night, make sure to remain in populated, well-lit areas, and walk confidently and with a purpose so that you at least pretend that you know where you are going. Avoid giving the impression that you are lost, and ask directions only from shops and not random people on the streets.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Driving"]},"\n\nIt is best to use a GPS when driving so that you do not get lost. Also be aware that more South Africans die from road accidents than from violence. There is a great deal of aggression on the roads, and many accidents are fuelled by alcohol.\n\nDo not leave any valuables on the seats as it is possible that your window could be smashed and your belongings grabbed. At night, do not stop at red traffic lights if you see people lingering there, as they may be up to no good. Slow down and go through the red traffic lights, even if you have to pay a fine (very small chance). At all times, be vigilant and watch for vehicles following you or road blocks (stones, wood) on the roads. If you have parked in a quiet area, be particularly careful when you go to and from your car as thieves can wait for victims to exit\/enter their vehicle. If you are faced with a suspicious or dangerous encounter, drive to the nearest police station or well-lit populated area.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Public transport"]},"\n\nThe Gautrain is totally safe.
