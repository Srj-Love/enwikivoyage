A bustling city and a significant regional transport and manufacturing hub, it has little of interest for the casual tourist.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nDeclared a city only in 1994, Johor Bahru is growing fast. Latest census figures indicate that it is Malaysia's second largest city proper (1.4 mn) and metropolitan area (2 mn). Given its relatively large land space, the city is not as dense as many other Malaysian cities.\n\nDue to its proximity to Singapore, it unavoidably suffers from comparison with its neighbour. Clean-up initiatives like greening the city and covering the open sewers that until a few years ago ran through the centre of the city have made it a more pleasant place to live. However, even up to now, there has been little effort in maintaining buildings and public facilities and even the city centre may seem run-down to some. Though appreciably less organised and much more messy compared to the glitz of Singapore, shopping and eating in the city can be a real adventure, with many shopping complexes and a wide variety of food establishments offering budget to fine dining.\n\nJohor Bahru is probably more well known as an industrial city than as a tourist-friendly town. Many of the world's top electronics manufacturers have at least one plant in Johor Bahru and its harbour is one of the busiest in the region.\n\nThe Sultan Iskandar Customs, Immigration and Quarantine Complex was opened in December of 2008 and an almost straight, 600 m long flyover now links this gigantic complex with the Causeway, making travelling more convenient.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Orientation"]},"\nJohor Bahru's metropolitan area can be easily divided into four parts - North, South, East and West.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["South"]}," - The main city centre is located on the southern part of the city which has a link to Singapore via the causeway.

The percentage price difference becomes greater the further you go into Singapore.

After clearing Malaysian immigration, walk about 50 meters past the tourist office and go down the escalator. The buses are all waiting at the departure bus bays (part of the CIQ) downstairs. These bus bays are also accessible by walking along the slip road that links the CIQ with Jalan Lingkaran Dalam. Fares from Johor Bahru CIQ to Larkin: CW1, CW2 and CWL 1.20 RM, SBS 170 1.50 RM (payable by EZ-link card - S$1.11), Singapore-Johore Express 1.00 RM. These fares are payable only under the following circumstances - a. You fail to board the SBS 170 bus within 45 minutes of alighting from the SBS 160, SBS 170 or SMRT 950 bus. b. You did not buy a valid, through ticket to Larkin while in Singapore. c. You had travelled on a bus of a different bus company from Singapore to Johor Bahru CIQ (e.g. Woodland Checkpoint to JB CIQ by CW1 or CW2, then JB CIQ to Larkin by Singapore-Johore Express or SBS 170, or vice versa. The trip should take about 8-10 min in the absence of heavy traffic. Note: CWL only plies between Johor CIQ and Larkin bus terminal.\n\nHowever, you can consider taking the Maju bus or Transit Link's orange-red 'City Bus' (all of these do not have bus numbers - they have the word 'Larkin' displayed on the front of the bus; the one-way bus fare is RM1.70) to Larkin bus terminal from either JB Sentral's bus bays (facing Jalan Jim Quee) or from the bus stop opposite City Square at Jalan Wong Ah Fook. City Square is less than 5 min walk from the JB passport control booths - turn left just before the tourist office and walk along the passageway until you reach the lobby of the CIQ. You then cross two overhead bridges - one linking the CIQ to JB Sentral and the other linking JB Sentral to City Square. Note that you are not allowed to walk to the CIQ departure bus bays from City Square or JB Sentral -  there is a sign forbidding entry to the passageway from the lobby.\n\nIn the other direction, upon entering the Johor Bahru CIQ, follow the signs for \"Woodlands\" to get to the immigration booths and then to the Singapore-bound buses one floor below.\n\nThe restriction of Malaysian operated buses not stopping anywhere within Singapore and conversely, Singapore ones in Johor Bahru could be used to your advantage. The exception is SJE where the only boarding\/ alighting point in Singapore is at Queen Street, even though it's a Singapore-registered bus. 30 min could easily be shaved off the journey time within Singapore alone by boarding express buses CW2,CW5 or SJE when leaving Singapore from the Queen Street terminal or Newton Food Centre's car park. A little more time could be saved on the Johor Bahru side by hopping on to a Singapore-registered non-express bus (e.g. SBS 160\/170, SMRT 950) once you clear Malaysian customs and immigration at the Johor Bahru CIQ, but you will have to pay a new fare as you did not start your journey in Singapore on a Singapore-registered non-express bus.\n\nIf you intend to go to Singapore from West Malaysia for a short trip, you can consider putting up for the night in a JB hotel and take a bus to and from Singapore. The hotels in JB are much cheaper than those in Singapore.\n\nFor the SBS and SMRT buses, you have to pay the exact fare if you do not have the EZ-Link card; you will not get any change back from the driver.\n\nHowever, for the Singapore-Johore Express bus and the CW2 bus departing from Queen Street Terminal, and for the CW5 bus departing from the Newton Food Centre car park, purchase the ticket from the ticket counter. Any change will be given by the ticket seller. Purchase the tickets for the Singapore-Johore Express bus departing from the Larkin bus terminal or Queen Street Terminal from the ticket counter and any change will be given. If you board the CW1, CW2 and CW5 bus elsewhere in Singapore or anywhere in Johor Bahru, you have to purchase the ticket from the driver and no change will be given.

If you get into a taxi not fitted with a meter, it might be best to get out again immediately to avoid being ripped off or later becoming engaged in arguments about the fare. Drivers will often claim there is no meter fitted to a taxi, but they have just hidden it, often with a rudimentary device such as a piece of cloth or cardboard in front of the faceplate of the meter. Travellers need to be vigilant when dealing with such taxi drivers, especially if the driver blatantly refuses to use his meter and negotiates a fare with you. A local person or someone more familiar with these tricks will not be fooled by this, as the driver is seeking to deceive the unwary with dishonesty and deception. Look for another taxi or insist that the driver use the meter and stop playing games. Taxi drivers will also often attempt to raise their fares after agreeing with the passengers on the amount to be paid during the initial negotiation. They will tend to get belligerent and aggressive and may even threaten passengers when passengers try to reason with them. Ride at your own risk. Some drivers demand extra money as a 'bonus' or for some fictitious 'extra' charge on top of the metered fare.

This could partly be due to the high profile that the Singaporean press gives to crime committed in Johor Bahru against its citizens. Even Johor Bahru citizens took to the streets in September 2007, asking for the city to take action against crime. Although the crime rate in Johor Bahru is still higher than in Singapore and elsewhere in Malaysia, things have become better since the Johor Bahru administration took action to increase the police presence and initiate several anti-crime measures - including the creation of a hotline for tourists to call should they require urgent police assistance.
