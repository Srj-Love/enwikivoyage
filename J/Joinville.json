It is principally an industrial city and many of its 500,000 inhabitants are of German descent.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nJoinville, in its first year known as Colônia Dona Francisca, was founded in 1851 by German, Swiss and Norwegian immigrants. Even though it is considered a German-Brazilian city, its name is French (Joinville was named after François d'Orléans, prince of Joinville, son of King Louis-Philippe of France, who married Princess Francisca of Brazil, in 1843). \n\nThe land where Joinville is located was part of the French and Brazilian Royal Family wedding gift, even though the Prince of Joinville and his Brazilian bride had never been to the land. However, a Royal Palace was built in their honor around 1870. In 1851, the French prince, after a financial crisis, sold almost all his lands in Southern Brazil to the German Senator Mathias Schröder.\nSenator Schröder was a member of the Colonization Society of Hamburg, which attracted immigrants to be sent to Brazil and thereby establish commercial ties between Germany and the German communities in Brazil. In 1851, the first 118 German and Swiss immigrants arrived, followed by 74 Norwegian immigrants. From 1850 to 1888, Joinville received 17,000 German immigrants, most of them Lutherans, poor peasants coming to occupy this part of Brazil. Later waves of immigration brought large numbers of Italian families to the area as well.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nNumerous cities around Brazil have flights to and from Joinville Airport, with the most regular (multiple daily flights) being ",{"type":"[[","value":[["São Paulo"]]}," (Congonhas Airport) and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rio de Janeiro"]]}," (Guarulhos Airport). \n\n\nGetting from Joinville airport to the city center, visitors have two options:\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Taxi"]}," (recommended): The drive takes on average about 25 minutes and the fare is between 33 and 35 BRL (20-22 USD) in 2011"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Public Transportation"]}," (recommended for locals only): There are no direct buses from the airport to the city center or the bus terminal (rodoviária).

Should you wish to venture out into the suburbs, Joinville has a reliable bus network which is used heavily by locals. Tickets can be purchased from any one of the numerous bus terminals around the city, or on the buses themselves. Be warned, however: both buses painted completely blue and those with a blue stripe on each side are direct buses, they generally go from one bus station to another without stopping.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Rua das Palmeiras, Joinville.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["right"],["Rua das Palmeiras in front of the National Museum of Immigration and Colonization."]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Bolshoi Ballet School"],["alt=Escola de Teatro Bolshoi"],["url=http:\/\/www.escolabolshoi.com.br\/bolshoi\/Portugues\/detIdioma.php?codidioma=1&codinstitucional=50"],["email="],["address=Avenida Beira Rio, 315"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=(47) 3422 4070"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Fri 10AM-4PM"],["price=R$3"],["content=Well worth a visit if you're in the area.
