Jomtien, like Pattaya, is popular with tourists, but has a significant population of permanent expat retirees and some workers, making it a more sedate alternative.\n\nAs with most Thai place and street names written using Latin characters, Jomtien is spelled in a number of ways with road signs usually reading Chom Tien or Chom Thian while shops and businesses use Jomtien.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Pattaya Park Tower view over Jomtien.jpg"],["thumb"],["350px"],["Pattaya Park Tower view over Jomtien"]]},"\n \n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nMost buses from Bangkok serve the main Pattaya bus terminal on North Pattaya Rd. Taxis are the easiest option for the onward trip to Jomtien. Songthaews (aka \"baht buses\", converted pick up trucks with two longitudinal benches in the back) also depart from the bus station and will drop travellers throughout Pattaya and Jomtien for between 20-150 baht depending on the distance travelled. If taking a baht bus it's advisable to know roughly where your intended stop is, as passengers have to push the buzzer to signal the driver to stop.\n\nThere were originally two bus terminals in Jomtien. The Soi Chaiyapruek terminal has closed, but the ticket office is still there. \n\nThe current terminal in Jomtien (near Beach Rd) is the car-park of a small shopping precinct, and a Foodmart Supermarket, opposite Pan-Pan Restaurant. It is a busy junction, arrivals going to Pattaya travel north, and Jomtien to the south.\n\nThere are also buses direct from Suvarnabhumi (BKK) airport (126 baht) to the Jomtien terminal. The fare is approximately 110 baht. In high season it is a good idea to book your ticket early on the day you are returning to the airport.\n\nIf you have very little or no luggage (and don't mind risking your life) motorcycle taxis are plentiful and should cost between 20-100 baht to any destination within Pattaya or Jomtien.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThere is no shortage of baht buses, they are helpful, and you simply indicate your destination. You will share with others, and should expect to pay about 20-50 baht per head.
