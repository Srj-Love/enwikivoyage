The Jordanian dialect of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Arabic phrasebook"],["Arabic"]]}," is similar to that spoken in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and by Arabs in the Palestinian territories and Israel.  As with all dialects of Arabic, the variations are in the spoken form of the language only; the written language always conforms to standard (or classical) Arabic.\n\n\nThe spoken Arabic language provides many difficulties for English speakers.  Aside from the various dialects, one must also deal with the differences in addressing males, females, and groups; plurals and verb conjugations are highly irregular and difficult to determine from their root letters; and there are several letters in the Arab alphabet that are difficult for an English speaker to pronounce.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Sub-dialects of Jordanian Arabic "]},"\nAlthough there is a common Jordanian dialect mutually understood by most Jordanians, there are regional distinct variations in various parts of the country with at times unique pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary.\n\nJordanian Arabic falls into three groups:\n",{"type":"*","value":["Rural Jordanian"]},{"type":"*","value":["Bedouin Jordanian"]},{"type":"*","value":["Urban Jordanian."]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Rural Jordanian "]},"\nIs spoken by Jordanian villagers and many of the small-city or village-born city dwellers.

This dialect is much truer to the Arabic language and is not widely used in the urban and rural regions and is considered sometimes hard to understand by most residents there.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Urban Jordanian "]},"\nThis variety was born after the designation of Amman as capital of the Jordanian kingdom early in the 20th century. It is the result of the merger of the language of populations who moved from Hauran (northern Jordan), Moab (southern Jordan) and Nablus into the new founded city. For this reason, it mixes features of the Arabic varieties spoken by these populations. The emergence of the language occurred under the strong influence of the Rural Jordanian ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hauran Arabic"]},".\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Pronunciation guide"]},"\n\nThere are some letters of the Arabic alphabet that transliterate into English; others are completely foreign to English speakers, making them difficult to pronounce.  The pronunciation guide shown below is case- sensitive; for example, 'th' is a different sound from 'Th' and 'TH'.  \n\nThere are only two glides, or diphthongs, in Arabic.  The first glides from 'a' to 'i' and gives an 'ay' sound as in the English word for ",{"type":"''","value":["bait"]},"; the second glides from 'a' to 'u' and gives the 'aw' sound as in the Arabic word ",{"type":"''","value":["mawt"]}," meaning 'death'. \n\nOne syllable of every Arabic word has more stress than the other syllables of that word.  Much meaning is communicated in Arabic by the location of the stress.  This is much truer than in most Western languages.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Vowels"]},"\nAlthough some dialects have an 'e' and an 'o', there are only three phonemic vowels that are common to Arabic:\n\n; a : like 'a' in \"apple\"\n; i : like 'ee' in \"cheese\"\n; o : like 'oo' in \"too\"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Consonants"]},"\nCharacters marked by an asterisk (*) are ones that may prove more difficult for English speakers than the others.\n\n; a (ا) : like 'aa' in \"back\"\n; b (ب) : like 'b' in \"bed\"\n; t (ت) : like 't' in \"top\"\n; th (ث) : like 'th' in \"think\"\n; j (ج) : like 'j' in \"jump\"\n; H (ح) * : like 'h' in \"hot\" (this sound is created by tightly constricting the throat muscles as you force air through; commonly referred to as \"heavy h\")\n; kh (خ) : like like 'ch' in Scottish \"loch\" or German \"nach\" (this sound is similar to a gargled exasperation, as if someone were clearing his throat)\n; d (د) : like 'd' in \"dog\" \n; Th (ذ) : like 'th' in \"that\"\n; r (ر) : like 'r' in \"row\"\n; z (ز) : like 'z' in \"haze\"\n; s (س) : like 's' in \"sing\"\n; sh (ش) : like 'sh' in \"sheep\"\n; S (ص) * : like 's' in \"sorry\" or \"saw\" (this sound has more force than an English 's'; commonly referred to as \"heavy s\")\n; D (ض) * : like 'd' in \"dot\" (this sound has more force than an English 'd'; commonly referred to as \"heavy d\")\n; T (ط) * : like 't' in \"taught\" (this sound has more force than an English 't'; commonly referred to as \"heavy t\")\n; TH (ظ) * : like 'th' in \"other\"\n; 9 (ع) * : like 'ei' in German \"nein\" (while there are different methods of transliterating this difficult character, this phrasebook sometimes uses the number ",{"type":"''","value":["9"]},", as the sound of the character mimics the sound of the stressed 'i' in \"nine\".)\n; g (غ) * : like French 'r' (this sound is a more gutteral—or gargled—version of the English 'g')\n; f (ف) : like 'f' in \"fox\"\n; q (ق) : like 'c' in \"cough\" \n; k (ك) : like 'k' in \"kitten\"\n; l (ل) : like 'l' in \"lamb\"\n; m (م) : like 'm' in \"mother\"\n; n (ن) : like 'n' in \"noon\"\n; h (ھ) : like 'h' in \"help\"\n; w (و) : like 'w' in \"wow\"\n; y (ي) : like 'y' in \"yes\"\n; ' (ء) : a glottal stop\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Phrase list"]},"\nAlternate versions of each word—used when addressing men, women, or groups—have been listed where applicable.
