The widely spoken language is Hausa although almost everyone speaks English.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nJos is served by many bus lines, chiefly Cross Country that runs air-conditioned mini-van services from Lagos and Abuja. The state government owned Plateau Line runs station wagon services, but these are mostly uncomfortably crowded trips. Many other state governments operate transport serices with terminuses in various Jos motor-parks from surrounding state capitals: Gombe, Lafia, Kaduna, Damaturu and even Yola. Other mini-bus or car services are private arrangements where you sit and wait for the vehicle to fill up, but are best avoided because the drivers tend to have dubious driving skills.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nArik air runs a once a day domestic flight from Lagos to Jos and back.

Some mini-bus routes are also defined but these are difficult to understand. The taxis and buses almost always tend to be rickety. Motorcycle taxis, commonly known as 'achaba' are also a choice but these can be very dangerous as the road network is filled with a lot of potholes and there is a general lack of safe practices. The achaba rides also tend to be more expensive that the taxi or bus rides but are very flexible.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThe old tin mines are all on the outskirts of Jos.
