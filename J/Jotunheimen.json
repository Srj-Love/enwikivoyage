This mountain range includes the highest summits in Norway (and Northern Europe) and some of the wildest alpine areas in Norway. While a few summits are only accessible by climbers, most of the area can easily be hiked by most visitors with proper boots and fitness. Glaciers can only be traversed with a guide and proper equipment. The name \"Jotunheimen\" has its roots in Norse mythology, and literally means \"The home of the giants\" (the mountain range was previously referred to as \"Giant Mountains\"). Jotunheimen is part of a long, virtually continuous line of mountains separating ",{"type":"[[","value":[["East Norway"]]}," from coastal and fjord districts of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Middle Norway"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["West Norway"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hardangervidda"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dovrefjell"]]}," are other important parts of this great barrier. The western most part of Jotunheimen sits at the intersection with the great ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sognefjord"]]}," and the fjord's adjacent valleys. The eastern part of Jotunheimen rises gradually above the mountain plateau west of road 51. Road 55 marks the northern limit of Jotunheimen, while roads E16 and 53 marks the southern limit.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nSeveral English and German noblemen used to visit Jotunheimen in late 1800s and early 1900s to explore the mountain area, and climb the mountains.  The Norwegian poet Vinje named many of the peaks in the western part of the park and is justly celebrated with a monument near Fondsbu DNT Hut.  The Norwegian national playwright Ibsen set one of the most famous scenes in his classic Peer Gynt on the dramatic Besseggen Ridge in the eastern part of the park. The Besseggen Ridge has become one of the most visited natural attractions in Norway with 1-2 people passing any given point every 2-3 minutes in high summer -- not a place for solitude!  The eccentric Englishman HC Slingsby popularised the area through his trip reports published in the Scottish Mountaineering Journal in the 1880s and 1890s.  He also published a classic book-length account entitled ",{"type":"''","value":["Norway: the northern playground"]},".
