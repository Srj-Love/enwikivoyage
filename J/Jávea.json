[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["style"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Jávea"]}," \/ ",{"type":"'''","value":["Xàbia"]}," is in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Costa Blanca"]]}," region in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alicante"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Spain"]]},". The town has three main areas namely Jávea old town, Jávea port, & the beach area. The old town has not changed much and is a maze of narrow winding streets with homes that have wrought iron balconies and windows in gothic style. There are many ancient churchs and other structures. The harbor and fishing port has numerous restaurants and bars overlooking the sea. The Arenal beach area is the main commercial and recreation centre of the town.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nJávea is also known by its Valencian name ",{"type":"''","value":["Xàbia"]},".\n\nValencia airport is 100 km to the north.\n\nAlicante is found 100 km to the south, and Murcia a bit further\n\nSeveral companies offer transportation from both nearby international airports, there is a train station connecting to Valencia and Benidorm in nearby Gata de Gorgos\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nFor most locations in Jávea a car is essential. If arriving at Valencia or Alicante airport there are several car rental companies readily available. If booking a car rental locally in Jávea it is generally advised to do so in advance of your journey as they tend to sell out during the busy summer season. Rent a car and walking\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nGrenadella cove is attached to Jávea but hidden away behind the buzz of the main Arenal beach. A spot well worth visiting for its natural beauty, tranquil atmosphere and historic castle ruins.\n\nMontgó's prehistoric cave dwellers and hunters dating from at least 30,000 years ago, and its paintings in Migdia cave are well-enough known. Its slopes have certainly yielded evidence of the ancient past to many local residents whether collecting Stone-Age handaxes and flints, Roman pottery or Muslim ceramics. If you are among those who gather the wild herbs still struggling to survive amid ever-increasing construction, just think of the Moorish Caliph Abd ur Rahman the Third who, 1000 years ago, at the beginning of the 10th century, made a special journey from Cordoba to collect over a hundred medicinal herbs from the slopes of our Montgó.\n\nThe slopes of Montgó, the tops of surrounding hills and the valley itself, all tell of the earliest known Neolithic settlements in the Western Mediterrean, where men developed agriculture and domesticated animals from around 3000 BC and into the Valencian Bronze Age between 1900 and 500 BC. In our Museum you can see Iberian beads, sherds of decorated pottery, stone axes and pestle and mortars found all around us, including from a fox's burrow dig into the hill crowned by the Santa Lucia Ermita, and which revealed a Bronze Age and Roman Village.\n\nVisigoths were here too. In the 6th century AD. Christian Visigoth monks whoses ancestors had accompanied the troops sent to battle in North Africa, came across to Javeda and founded the monastery of San Martin, now disappeared but which probably gave its name to the Cabo San Martin. Here Hermangildo, son of the Visigoth king Leogevild of Toledo, sought refuge in the Monastery after angering his father by marrying a Christian girl. When his father's troops arrived to arrest him all but one ancient monk fled to Portichol - but Hermengild and the old monk were killed. You'll find a number of Javiense with Visigoth names even today.\n\nA dilapidated village house in the angle of Santa Marta, leading off the Church Square, was pulled down and in the brief period given the archaeologists to examine the site, they made an astonishing discovery- The foundations of the 17th - 18th century house had been built right on top of a 3000 year old Bronze Age farming site, thus preserving the remains of two cabins and several silos.  And in San Bartholome. the next street, facing the church, another house has been demolished to reveal relicsof a 14th. century dwelling with a cistern, well and various ceramics and coins.\n\nCome to that, do you remember when the police station, then part of the Ayuntamiento was moved to its purpose-built location opposite the car park, in 1994(?) The intention was to open a tourist office in the old premises, part of the Ayuntamiento, and renovations included relaying the floor. But what did they find? Fourteenth century graves- some with several skeletons added later, all of the first Christians to repopulate Jávea after the long Muslim occupation- The cemetery was in use for another two hundred years and archaeologists found the remains of what appeared to have been a high, fortified tower and the later, smaller, 17th century chapel of the Desamparados. Making use of some of this material the original Ayuntamiento was built over them in 1774.  Fortunately several of the rock-cut graves - without their skeleton inmates which have been removed to the nearby Museum - have been preserved and can be seen under the glass floor as you enter what is one of the Ayuntamiento's offices.\n\nA datable lead weight used by Roman fishing boats, put back Roman occupation of Jávea to the 2nd century BC, making ours the oldest known Roman site on the coast with a commercial port for fish and minerals. And of course you know about the important Roman fish factory under the Parador, and the nearby cemetery, probably the largest in the province, part of which lies under the recently built \"Alkazaba holiday apartments.\n\nThe late Solar Blasco, that fine artist who painted the triptich (now divided) over the Ermita de Popol's altar, and who was also our Alcalde, greatly concerned about Jávea's past, showed me many Roman and Iberian sites already lost or being covered by apartments along the coast. He pointed out the remnants of a Roman theatre, now disappeared, on the slopes of Montgó overlooking the main Valencia road, and a temple site by the Arenal's Canal de la Fontana, among many other relics of Jávea's ancient past.\n\nThere is little left of the Moors but some inscribed gravestones and ceramics, although they were here from about 714AD until the last were expelled from Jávea and Dénia in 1609. Most were farmers, cultivating and terracing the land but undoubtedly there are remains hidden beneath many buildings and wooded areas.\n\nWell, walk where you will in the valley, town or hills, you can be sure of one thing, you are walking on history.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Visit Mercadillos - weekly open air markets for all kinds of goods."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Go visit the Fuentes del Algar Waterfalls in the Mountains"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Go visit the caves near Benidoleig or Canalobre"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Go swim, sun and surf at the Arenal Beach"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Rent a sailboat, sailboard or jet ski"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Take the ferry boats to Dénia or Altea"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Take a hike to the top of Montgo"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Go parasailing"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Go skin or scuba diving in the sea"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Watch the commercial fishing boats come in at the port"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Visit the Dénia castle and museum"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Take a walk at the arenal"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Go visit one of the Safari Parks - Aitana or Vergel"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Visit all the view spots of Miradors"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Go to the Rastro - Antique markets - in Jalon on Saturday"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Take a ride up to the castle in Guadelest"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Go visit Alicante"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Take a ride on the Lemon Express"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Have a coffee and brandy on the seafront in the Port"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Pick some books up at the used bookstore - Pollys"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Go to the waterpark in Benidorm"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Topless sunbathing at the beach"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Take a walk down the tree lined street in Dénia"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Visit the Solar Blasco museum in the Town"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Go to a Bodega and find an old bottle of wine - 64 Rioja!"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Visit the fishermans church in Jávea Port"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nFlowers at the Jávea port from funky florist Cream and Browns Florist, or visit there site at http:\/\/www.creamandbrowns.com\/\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Corral del Pato"]}," - One of our favourites outside of Gata on Lliber-Jalon road.
