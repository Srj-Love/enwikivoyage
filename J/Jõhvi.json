The most important architectural monument in Jõhvi is a mighty Gothic fortress built in the 13th century. In the Middle Ages, it was surrounded by a rampart and a ditch. Now, a museum for Jõhvi's fortress church is located in the vaulted cellars.\n\nAs a typical merchant center, Jõhvi town grew around a market place, which was surrounded by a tavern, post office, shops, an inn, banks and, since 1895, a Russian Orthodox church. All the roads leading to the town met at the market place, right in front of the post office. Today, a symbolic direction sign which shows distances to places from Rome to Moscow, and to all of Jõhvi's friendship towns, marks this place.\n\nIn 1917, in the midst of a revolutionary period, Jõhvi was recognised as a borough, and in 1938 it was recognised as a town. At the same time, with the development of the oil shale industry, the town grew into a metropolitan centre. \n\nDuring World War II, the historic centre of Jõhvi was badly damaged.\n\nDue to its convenient location, Jõhvi became the county centre as early as 1949. Now, besides the county government offices, most of the central institutions for the region have moved to the town, and the regional offices of many large companies are also found here. Jõhvi has become the business and financial centre of Ida-Viru county. Rapid development has given the town a youthful life style . The heart of cultural life in today's Jõhvi is the concert hall and culture and hobby centre, which are to be opened in October 2005.\n\nToday 70,000 people in total live within a couple of dozen kilometres of the city.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nA railway and a highway connecting ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tallinn"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saint Petersburg"]]}," pass through the town, and it is also crossed by the Jõhvi - Tartu - Riga highway. In Ida-Virumaa, all roads lead to Jõhvi, as this is the only way to cross the county from one side to the other.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Tourist Information Centre"],["alt="],["url="],["email=johvi@visitestonia.com"],["address=Rakvere 13a"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+372 337 05 68"],["tollfree="],["fax=+372 337 05 68"],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Jõhvi`s Concert Hall"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.concert.ee"],["email=johvi@concert.ee"],["address=Pargi 40"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+372 334 2000, +372 334 2001"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Jõhvi is the home of Estonia's newest concert hall, offering the best opportunities.

They are suitable for classical and rock concerts, theatre performances and exhibitions, receptions and balls, seminars and international conferences. The chamber hall has the newest cinema equipment. In addition, the house has four seminar rooms of different sizes for training, seminars and meetings. There is no limit to the usage options of the concert hall, except for the organiser's imagination. During the season, from autumn to spring, on average one or two concerts a week take place in the Jõhvi Concert Hall. During the summer season we also organise several concerts at other beautiful locations throughout Ida-Viru County.
