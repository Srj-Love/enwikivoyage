At the time when first settlers arrived in Iceland, the edge of Breiðamerkurjökull, an outlet glacier of the great glacier Vatnajökull, is thought to have been 20km further north than it is now. The climate began to cool in about the year 1200, the cold spell reaching a peak in the period 1600-1900, which is sometimes known as the \"Little Ice Age\". As a result the glacier advanced until about 1890, reaching a point only about 1km from the coast at Jökulsá river. The eastern part of the glacier eroded the sediments of Breiðamerkursandur to a depth of up to 300m below sea level, the sediment being carried forward by the river Jökulsá. Without the river the glacier could not have eroded such a deep basin, because it is the river that carries the sediment to the sea.\n\nThe warm period from 1920 to 1965 caused great changes in Breiðamerkurjökull glacier. It retreated very quickly, leaving a lagoon up to 190m deep where the glacier snout had been, and several kilometers of glacial moraines were exposed on both sides of the lagoon. The lagoon grew from 8km² in 1975 to 15km² in 1998. Large blocks of ice break off the edge of the glacier, which is about 30m high, keeping the lagoon stocked with icebergs.\n\nThe lagoon, when frozen, was used in the 2002 ",{"type":"'''","value":["James Bond"]}," film, ",{"type":"''","value":["Die Another Day"]},", for a BMW chase scene.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\nThe white cap of Breiðamerkurjökull glacier dominates the lagoon and its icebergs. Jökulsárlón is separated from the sea by only a short distance, and the combined action of the glacier, the river that empties from the lake, and the ocean may eventually transform it into an inlet of the sea. There are plans to prevent this from happening, since the only road in the area passes over the narrow isthmus.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nThe weather is fairly temperate year round around Jökulsárlón but one should bring a waterproof winter coat and wear waterproof shoes.  During the winter it may be cold, windy, and rainy so winter weather clothing is advisable.  During summer, a lightly insulated jacket may make an extended time viewing the lagoon more enjoyable. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Fauna"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Relaxing seals.jpg"],["250px"],["thumbnail"],["Relaxing seals"]]},"\nSeals can frequently be observed swimming in the lagoon or resting on the shores or icebergs. Shoals, herring and capelan are brought into the lagoon by tidal currents and become pray to the birds. In the summertime skuas, big seagulls, nest on around the lake.

Because Jokulsarlon lies along the major ring road it is easily accessed. The two best ways are (1) rent a car from Reykjavik or (2) rely on the highly efficient, very punctual public bus that will happily drop you off for as long as you like. Because car rentals in Iceland tend to be very expensive (well in excess of $150 per day for a compact Suzuki SUV) their public national transit system is outstanding. Buses can be taken virtually anywhere; take one to Jokulsarlon, stay for a few hours, then catch another headed in either direction along the ring road.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Glacial ice just east of the Jökulsá.jpg"],["250px"],["thumbnail"],["Don't miss the beach"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Jokulsarlon Lagoon - The lagoon is easily accessible from the large parking area on the east side of the lagoon.
