It is the perfect place to escape the package tourist groups, and a great place on the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mediterranean Turkey"],["Turkish Mediterranean"]]}," to have a truly laid-back experience.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Kabak beach.jpg"],["thumb"],["350px"],["Kabak beach, as seen from Kabak village"]]},"\n\nAs it doesn't have sufficient population to be designated as a \"village\", Kabak is officially a neighbourhood of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Faralya"],["Uzunyurt"]]},", and as such, is usually omitted from maps, even quite detailed ones. \n\nKabak consists of two physically separate sections: the settlement proper, a small agglomeration of two-story buildings along the road, clinging on a mountainside way above the coastline (though with a view of beautiful Mediterranean), and the cluster of guesthouses below, between the coast and the canyon known as ",{"type":"''","value":["Kabak Koyu"]},", which, with its pine groves, waterfalls, and coastline, is quite similar to much more famous Butterfly Valley of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Faralya"]]},"; however physical access to Kabak Koyu is a little easier than Butterfly Valley, although the relative remoteness of Kabak offsets that.\n\nThe state of development in Kabak is in major flux. There are still backpacker\/family oriented places that are truly interested in keeping Kabak beautiful and are invested for the long-term (Full Moon, Reflections, Sultan, Kabak Valley Camping, and a few more), but they are being pushed out of the way by developers who just want to make a buck quickly (Lonely Planet authors got free accommodation\/food here in exchange for a certain place being highlighted) and have no interest in the long-term outcome of Kabak besides profit. Someone who remembered it from 2005 would find it different now. For example, to build a resort on the property closest to the beach, they cut down the forest next to the beach. They also want to pave the road to the beach so package tourists can come. If you want to stay at a place that is helping Kabak stay beautiful, choose wisely.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThere are ",{"type":"'''","value":["minibuses"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["dolmuş"]},") from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fethiye"]]}," passing ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ovacik"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ölüdeniz"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Faralya"]]}," on the way. The trip from Fethiye takes a little more than an hour. Busses are relatively frequent, they leave from Fethiye every hour from 7:00 to 18:00 (except 8:00 & 12:00). Busses from Kabak return hourly from 8:30 to 19:30 (except 9:30 & 13:30) on the same route. 4 TL for a trip from Ölüdeniz, 6.5 TL from Fethiye further away.\n\nA heavily winding road connects Kabak with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ölüdeniz"]]},", passing through ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Faralya"]]}," on the way. Road condition is good until the upper village of Kabak. Descending into the valley, it's a rough dirt road. Total distance from Ölüdeniz is around 25 km.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lycian Way"]]},", a waymarked hiking trail passes through the village, providing a tiresome but peaceful connection with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ölüdeniz"],["Ovacık"]]},", a suburb of Ölüdeniz. It takes a de-tour through the mountains, with many impressive vistas and through hamlets no one—except hikers—has ever been, and gradually loses height for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Faralya"]]},", once more to go up to mountains and descending this time to Kabak. Most hikers break this 22-km section into two days, with an overnight stay in one of Faralya's guesthouses.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nYou can follow the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lycian Way"]]},", indicated by ",{"type":"'''","value":["red and white painted stones"]}," that lead all the way down to the beach, about 20 minutes downhill on a dirt path, and beyond. It will pass by many places to stay, most with restaurants if you want to eat. Another branch of the Lycian Way passes around the upper part of the valley.\n\nThere is a dirt road (branching from the main road from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Faralya"]]}," about 2 km away from the village) leading into the canyon and the coast, however if you have any smallest bit of love for your car, avoid driving through that road (think of a rocky downslope where the soft topsoil has all but bulldozed). Instead, you may park your car in the upper village and take a ",{"type":"''","value":["dolmuş"]}," down there—they don't have fixed hours (i.e., ready to go as soon as you pay; but you may have to wait for one returning from the coast first) and, regardless of the number of passengers, do have the fixed price of 35 TL, which, if lucky, you may share with fellow travellers waiting for one when you get there. Ask at the grocery store at the upper village for these ",{"type":"''","value":["dolmuş"]},"es.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See and Do"]},"\nYou can see the ",{"type":"'''","value":["canyon"]}," itself and a number ",{"type":"'''","value":["waterfalls"]}," along the canyon's sides (you have to hike a bit out of the village), ",{"type":"'''","value":["swim"]}," in the Mediterranean, and perhaps take a cheesy ",{"type":"'''","value":["yoga"]}," course offered by many of the guesthouses on the coast.

From the left side of the beach (looking toward the sea), continue following the red and white stones 20-25 minutes. You will see a big sign (put up by the Full Moon owner, Mustafa) that shows the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lycian Way"]]}," to the right and waterfalls to the left. You will be able to follow the pipeline and old river until the waterfall. Beware: This is not a real hiking path and requires some climbing that may be dangerous. There are six or seven pools successively higher. From the waterfall, you can either return the way you came, or you can follow the red painted stones until that path rejoins the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lycian Way"]]}," with red and white stones.
