Matava wil cost you about the same as a five star hotel. Your level of comfort will be similar to the middle ages. You will experience the absence of many basic services and necessities as part of the eco experience. Many basic comforts such as fan in your room, insect proofing bures, night lights, electricity after 5 p.m.are missing at this resort. You are expected to be happy with cold showers, mud beaches and spiders in your room. After staying at Matava, I have developed a fear of the term \"eco\". It means poor service and having to put up with third world standards while paying exorbitant prices. If you ask for basic needs and comforts to be accommodated, you will probably be told that \"NO, we are an eco resort! We do not provide that.\" (e.g powerpoints in your room, cold water to drink, proper coffee etc) Alternatively, the management will simply ignore your request, as they did for us.\nThe diving here is good. However, the locals live off the reefs and hunt them regularly. The large fish have been speared and the remaining fish are wary of divers. I expected much better. \nOn a positive note, the food is very good, the Fijian staff are excellent, the views are great, the diving operation is well run.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nSafety while on the island is totally provided by the resorts.
