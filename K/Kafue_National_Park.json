It's geography varies considerably from flood plains in the north to desert regions in the south.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nA huge Baobob tree is at \"Treetops\" Conservation School Camp not far from the Busanga Flood Plains. The school accepts small numbers of children in the dry season for short stays to help educate them about the Park's wildlife. It became very rundown but was renovated by a group of schools from Lusaka because educating the next generation of Zambians about the country's remaining widlife is vital for future conservation of the Park.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\nKafue is extremely rich in animal life. Hippo abound in the rivers with good sightings of huge crocodiles. Many species of birds, large and small are abundant. Elephant too are on the come-back after extensive poaching and are frequently seen along the river banks and even venture into the camps and lodges. Hoofed animals are also thriving in the park especially Puku, Kudu, Red Lechwe, Impala, Waterbuck, Bushbuck, Oribi, Blue Duiker, Burchells Zebra and many others. Also to be seen are Warthogs, Mongooses, Nile Monitor Lizards, Porcupine, Cerval, Civet, Terrapin, Vervet Monkeys and Bush Babies as well as Cape Buffalo, Blue Wildebeest, Lion and Leopard. These are the main animals which live in the park but of course there are many more. The two animals of the \"big five\" which are missing from the northern areas are the Rhino and Giraffe. The Rhino was poached out and is the subject of debate as to whether to re-introduce it.\n\nBaobob, Mahogan, Sausage, Sycamore Fig, Ilala Palm, Wild Date and Acacia are just a minute few of the varied trees and bushes that grow profusely in Kafue, many to a huge size in the northern areas because of the high rainfall.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nThe northern area receives more rain than the south so it is best visited in the winter months from July to October when the rainy season is over as many areas are impassable and flooded during the summer. The lodges only open in the winter months as the plains are totally awash and many roads are under water. The rivers too, rise to high levels, the evidence of which can still be seen after they've gone down, by the water-weed hanging high from the branches of the trees and by the damage to the road surfaces and small bridges, many of which need urgent repair before the area can be accessed again.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nGetting there and getting around, the traveller has three choices. Firstly, you can fly in and stay at one of the better lodges where the staff will walk, drive or boat you around that area of the park. Secondly, you can drive yourself into and around the park. Thirdly, arrangements can be made with an outside agency or company to drive you into and around the park.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" International: $40 per person per day (park entry fee plus bed night fee)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" SADC: $30 per person per day (park entry fee plus bed night fee)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Citizens: K40,320 per person per day (park entry fee plus bed night fee)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Residents: K158,400 per person per day (park entry fee plus bed night fee)"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nThe jewel in Kafue's crown is the Zambezian flooded grasslands ecoregion in the north, including the Busanga Swamp and plains.

The area is also noted for its birdlife.\n\nGo on a walking safari with Phil Jeffery of Jeffery and McKeith Safaris.
