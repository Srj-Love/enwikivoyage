It is famed for its marine mammals (whales, dolphins, seals) and other sea-life, all of which you can see, some of which you can swim with, and some you can eat. In Maori, kai means \"eat\" and koura is \"crayfish' (rock lobster). So Kaikoura is a place to eat crayfish!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nKaikoura lies on a narrow coastal plain between high mountains and the Pacific Ocean.  In places along this coast the mountains drop almost straight into the sea, with barely enough flat land for a single railway line, two lane road and rocky beach, and even then some short tunnels are needed on corners. The steepness of the mountains reflects the underwater geography as well. The deep-water Hikurangi Trench and the continental shelf edge lies just offshore here. This causes the ocean around Kaikoura to be rich in sea life and attracts seals, whales (and humans) to the area to partake in the bounty of the sea.\n\nThe town itself has a similar charm to an east coast USA beach town, with a hodgepodge of signs trying to grab tourists' attention.  At the edges of the town, the more relaxed and nature-oriented activities again take precedence.\n\nKaikoura is the perfect place to enjoy both the wonders of the magnificent Pacific Ocean and the tall, majestic mountains. A great place to stay, it is also an ideal rest stop on a section of State Highway 1 (SH1) that passes through isolated country both north and south of the town.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nThe Maori settled in Kaikoura long before European colonisation of New Zealand and cultivated the coastal plain, planting kumara, a form of sweet potato. Maori legend has it that Maui placed his foot on the Kaikoura Peninsula to steady himself as he 'fished-up' the North Island.\n\nIn 1770, Captain Cook discovered the Kaikoura Peninsula, believing it to be an island at first. Early European settlers used Kaikoura as a whaling station from 1842 and the remains of pots used to render the whale blubber can be seen on the town foreshore.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nA number of bus or shuttle services run between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Picton (New Zealand)"],["Picton"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Christchurch"]]},".

The train journey is fantastic, with the mountains on one side and the ocean on the other. The track follows the coast for the last part of the journey into Kaikoura and you can often see fur seals lazing on the rocks. The station is on Whaleway Station Road (presumably named because Whale Watch Kaikoura operate out of the station).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Kaikoura Airport"]}," is one of New Zealand's smaller airports.
