In ancient times, the area was considered the premier place to live due to the excellent weather and good water.  Many kings made their homes here. Later, missionaries built churches and residences turning the tiny fishing village into a small seaport. It was the home of King Kamehameha I who united the Hawaiian Islands.   Now Kona has become known for sport fishing, snorkeling, sunsets and coffee, which is cultivated on the slopes of Mount Hualalai. Because the mountains block the northeasterly trade winds, Kona gets very little rain and enjoys more than 300 days of sunshine a year.
