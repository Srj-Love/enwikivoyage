For many visitors, Kajaani is a stop on their way to the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vuokatti"]]}," skiing centre, located 40 kilometres east of the city. As Kajaani is the largest city (36 000 inhabitants) in Kainuu, there are more shopping opportunities than in Vuokatti.

Since the Kainuu region borders ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russia"]]},", that language holds an important position as residents from both countries visit the other for business and pleasure. Some residents can also speak German and French.\n\nThe locally strong Finnish accent adds extra vowels to words. Even if you're capable of speaking and understanding Finnish at a basic level, you may find it hard to understand some elderly people.

Roads are well maintained and taken good care of overall.\n\nIn the Kainuu region (and Finland generally) driving is a very practical way to get around and that's not only because of the long distances (and the weaker public transport). Landscapes are magnificent and it's so relaxing to drive around in almost empty roads.
