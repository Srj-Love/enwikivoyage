It is located about an hour from Siliguri and four hours from Darjeeling in India. Most people will want to leave it as soon as they get there.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nIt is possible to get through tickets from travel agents in Kathmandu or Darjeeling between Kathmandu and Darjeeling. Usually this trip is very expensive compared to doing it yourself and there is no reason it to do it as it is easy to arrange everything yourself. You also can take whatever bus you want, rather than being restricting to take what is arranged for you. Usually from Kakarbhitta they arrange a night bus to Kathmandu, and therefore and you can not take the day bus and see the views on the way.\n\nOften people are ripped off by these combined bus trips and are told they are going on a first-class luxury bus and then going on inferior services.\n\nAir The closest airport is at Bhadrapur, 25km southwest of Kakarbhitta. On Gorkha Airlines (023 20549) and Cosmic Air there are daily flight to Kathmandu ($99). You can also get a flight to Kathmandu from Biratnagar, 3 hours away, which has a more reliable schedule.\n\nBus When you cross the border from India, the bus station is on the right before the village. Buses depart to Kathmandu (16 hr, Rs 350) usually in the early morning and between 3 and 6 pm. It is best to reserve a bus seat a few hours early in order to get a good seat (in the front). You can reserve a night bus to Kathmandu at the booking office in front of the bus station. Direct night buses to Kathmandu and Pokhara can be painful, not only is the trip long, but you also miss the fantastic views along the way. The views between Itahari and Janakpur are particularly good, passing over the large Sapta Kosi.\n\nThere is a night bus from the border directly to Pokhara. You can also get a bus to the interesting town of Janakpur (6 hr, depart 6 to 9 am, Rs 165) and break your journey in this pleasant town.\n\nThere are buses to Biratnagar (3½ hr, Rs 75) and one night bus to Birganj (12 hr, Rs 225).\nBuses to Kakarbhitta depart from the Kathmandu Bus Terminal between 4 and 6 pm. It is best to book them a day in advance.\n\nTo\/From India The Indian border is half a kilometre east of town, and is marked by the Mechi River. Nepali immigration is open 24 hours, but you may have to look for the officials after dark. It will make it easier to get a Nepali visa if you have the correct amount in US cash dollars. If you do not have dollars you will have to go to the bank and change your money, and if it is closed you will have to wait. The immigration office here can also issue trekking permits for eastern Nepal including for the Everest area.\n\nWhen you cross the border you can get one of the shared jeeps to Siliguri for Rs 35 per person. It is a 10-minute walk from Kakarbhitta to the Indian border town of Raniganj. A rickshaw is Indian Rs 6 (Rs 10 Nepali). From Raniganj there is a minibus (Rs 35 Indian per person) to Siliguri (1 hr, 35 km, Rs 6 Indian). From Siliguri you can take the toy-train or bus (3½ hr, Rs 50 Indian) to Darjeeling (79km), or a bus to Gangtok or Kalimpong. You could also take a taxi to Siliguri (Rs 60 Indian) or Darjeeling (Rs 140 Indian). From New Jalpaiguri (NJP), you can get a broad-gauge train to Calcutta and other places. The nearby airport in Bagdogra has flights to Calcutta and Delhi.\n\nThe overnight buses from Kathmandu usually arrive before 10 am\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=kakarbhitta"],["url="],["email="],["address=kakarbhitta"],["lat="],["long=12"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nThe Tourist Office (20208) is on the main road, a little past the custom office on the right hand side (Sunday to Thursday 10 am to 5 pm, Friday 10 am to 2 pm).\n\nYou can change money at the Nepal Rastra Bank, on the pink building (sign only in Nepali) on the left side of the road as you enter town from India.
