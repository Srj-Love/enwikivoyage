The park's mission is to provide a well-maintained community ensuring the present patient residents of the Kalaupapa Settlement may live out their lives there. The park also supports the education of present and future generations concerning Hansen's disease or leprosy, a disease shrouded in fear and ignorance for centuries.  \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThe primary story being told at Kalaupapa National Historical Park is the forced isolation from 1866 until 1969 of people from Hawai'i afflicted with Hansen's disease (leprosy) to the remote northern Kalaupapa peninsula on the island of Molokai.   \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["Hawaii's Forgotten County"],["Not many people realize that the Kalaupapa settlement is its own county (Kalawao County), separate from the rest of the island of Molokai, which is part of Maui County. By land area, Kalawao County is the smallest county in the United States and, with a population of only 90 at the 2010 census, has the second-smallest population. It's the only county in the United States that is under the exclusive jurisdiction of health authorities, who still  maintain control over access."]]}," \n\nFew places in the world better illustrate the human capacity for endurance or for charity than the remote Kalaupapa Peninsula on the island of Moloka’i. The area achieved notoriety in 1865 when the Kingdom of Hawai`i instituted a century-long policy of forced segregation of persons afflicted with Hansen's disease, also known as leprosy. The Legislative Assembly had passed, and King Kamehameha V approved, ",{"type":"''","value":["An Act to Prevent the Spread of Leprosy"]}," to set apart land to seclude people believed capable of spreading the disease.\n\nOnce the decision was made, and the law passed, the government proceeded to purchase lands and move the Hawaiian residents to other homes. The village of Kalawao on the isolated Kalaupapa Peninsula thus became home to thousands of leprosy victims subsequently moved here from throughout the Hawaiian Islands.\n\nHawai`i’s actions brought attention to the mysterious and dreaded disease that reached epidemic proportions in the islands in the late 1800s. With new cases threatening to eradicate the native population and no knowledge of what caused the disease, officials were desperate. At the time, there was no effective treatment and no cure. To government officials, isolation seemed the only answer.\n\nThe first group of Hansen's disease patients were sent to Kalawao on the eastern, or windward side of the Kalaupapa peninsula on 6 Jan 1866. The churches of Siloama, established in 1866 and St. Philomena, begun in 1872 and associated with the work of Father Damien (Joseph DeVeuster) are located at Kalawao. Father Damien's life and death among his people focused the attention of the world on the problem of this disease and the plight of its victims. After Damien's death in 1889, the people of England established a fund and a commission for the scientific investigation of the disease. \n\nEventually, the treatment of Hansen's disease progressed to the point where it could be controlled by antibiotics and rendered non-contagious. However, even after the quarantine was lifted in 1969, many residents chose to remain at the settlement. The state Department of Health provided that no new patients would be admitted, and those remaining can stay for the rest of their lives.  \n\nSituated on the leeward side of the peninsula, ",{"type":"'''","value":["Kalaupapa Settlement"]}," is still home for several surviving Hansen's disease patients whose memories and experiences are cherished values. Once a community in isolation, Kalaupapa now serves as a place for education and contemplation. The site became a national park in 1980 dedicated to preserving the memories and lessons of the past.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nKalaupapa is a warm, humid place.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nKalaupapa cannot be reached by automobile.

The trail links topside Moloka'i to the Kalaupapa Settlement and has a 1700 foot elevation change, is three miles long and has twenty-six switchbacks.

Well, basically the same way you got in. If you came down the Kalaupapa Trail on a mule . . you went out the same way, over all those switch-backs (26 in all) and the only other way, besides by sea, would have been to fly in and out on a charter.  Before the trip began, the guides gave us some instructions which included a day pass, issued by the State of Hawai’i, to enter the colony and to leave the colony.  We were told that pictures of anything may be taken with one exception.  We would not be allowed to photograph a  resident. The fine for doing so is $500. You better believe that got everyone’s attention. Also, each mule has a name and you would be  required to commit the mule’s name to memory. You may start to get apprehensive at this instruction as many of the mules had long Hawaiian names . . . You may luck out! You'll probably be told, and this makes good sense too, that it is easier for the guide to call out the mule’s name than to try to remember your name. If you think mules are just overgrown donkeys, you may be in for a surprise. They're big - real big!\n\nOnce you're all mounted and preparing to depart for the trail, you'll be given final instructions: “The mules know exactly where they are going, just sit down and relax. Stay straight saddle and enjoy the views.”\nThis is the way to go in and out. Be sure you make a reservation!\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usablepark"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Molokai"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Kalawao County, Hawaii"]]}]
