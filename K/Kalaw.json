The countryside surrounding the town is dotted with ethnic minority villages and agricultural lands growing ginger, oranges, tea, cauliflower and other produce.  Limited wild, uncultivated areas exist in the area surrounding the catchment for Kalaw's water reservoir.  Treks to Inle lake are particularly popular, with 3-day, 2-night and 2-day 1-night (including a taxi ride part way) options commonly available.  Loop treks around the Kalaw area of varying lengths are also possible. If you only have 3 days, it is a good idea to go trekking one day around Kalaw and do the 1-night, 2-day trek to Inle Lake as it will give a wider variety of experiences, and you can enjoy the nice mountain views from the hills around Kalaw.\n\nA large number of trekking companies compete for business in the town.  Many are associated with a guesthouse and will happily visit you at yours to explain possible options.  Better companies will create flexible itineraries, tailoring your trip based on the level of difficulty you can handle, and the types of sights you'd like to see.  Some guides are even able to make modifactions to your route during the trek depending on conditions.\n\nGuided treks in the Kalaw area are excellent value.  Expect to pay around 30000Kyat\/day for a group of two, 36000 for a group of three or 40000 for a group of four including all meals, accommodation and unlimited tea with meals (though not including treated water, which is available for purchase in many villages along the routes.)  As most visitors to Kalaw plan to trek, it is usually not difficult to meet others to form a group with and thus reduce the per-person price.\n\nForwarding luggage to a guesthouse in the Inle lake area should cost around 3000 Kyat per bag.\n\nThe following trekking companies (amongst many others) provide good treks through multiple areas with enthusiastic English speaking guides local  are\n\nName   =Ko Min (trekking guide)\nEmail    =kalawcountryside@gmail.com\n                571min@gmail.com\nPh No.  =(95)0936090073\nAddress=Merchant street,Quarter(5)\n                 Kalaw Myanmar\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Jungle King Trekking Company"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions= Easiest to reach via Golden Lily guesthouse"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content= Very good trekking company offering fair prices.

Most paths are not too though to carry a backpack on (they are usually used by locals to haul large amounts of agricultural produce on foot!)  If you can have a GPS, you can download\/follow the trekking maps on www.openstreetmap.org uploaded by other trekkers.
