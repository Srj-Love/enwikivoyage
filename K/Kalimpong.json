There are a number of religious sites to see, including the Catholic church and Zong Dhog Palri Fo Brang monastery which, after a pleasant 2km walk from town commands wonderful views of Kalimpong and the mountains.\n\nOne can roam around the town, or take a tour or go trekking. There are some really interesting places to visit such as Gauripur House (home of the great Bengali poet Ravindra Nath Tagore), Mangal Dham a temple, Deolo the highest point in Kalimpong offering a guest house with spectacular vistas. Biking is possible as the traffic is not intense and its really enjoyable to view the beautiful scenery, and the kindhearted people living in the outskirts.\n\nThe climate of Kalimpong is ideal for the cultivations of horticultural plants. There are various nurseries here which house varieties of exquisite orchids, gladioli, marigolds, amaryllis and many other flowers. Some nurseries here are -\n\n'.'Pine View Nursery '.Sri Ganesh Mani Pradhan Nursery' '.Sri L.B. Pradhan Nursery' '.B.N.

Don't hesitate to bargain -- you can haggle quite a bit if you want to. Or if you are adventurous, just walk a bit more to the wholesale market (just around the corner from the main street). Its fixed price, but you won't get a better deal anywhere else in town.  To buy clothes all you have to do is to visit R.C, Mintri road full of marwadis, and you just can't stop yourself from purchasing for yourself something that is made for you.

This is a fixed price shop with extremely reasonable prices. You can get paintings, statues, wall hanging, knives, porcelain, crystal, thankhas, dragons, items made from bone, masks, souvenirs, etc. It's the wholesale supplier\/importer\/exporter for the northern region. Prices here are usually 2-3 times cheaper than anywhere else in the region.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nThe best place for Chinese food, is China Garden, tucked in near the bus stop. They make great Mei Foon and their Chicken Drumsticks are worth the inevitable queue during tourist season. A tip, though. Hit the place before 8PM as this town shuts down early. \nFor Indian Food and Drinks head to The Soods Garden Retreat,open till 10PM\n\nFor the best momo, it's Gompu's - you can also get a very decent lunch or dinner at this place. The place stays open until 9PM. You can also try other Tibetan \/Chinese dishes like Thukpa (noodles) at A.B.C Restaurant, R.C. Mintri Road. For veg momos you should visit Sagar, Evergreen(on the Main Road), Unique, Shikhar, Mohan Daju and all the hawkers (thela walas).\n\nYou'd miss something if you didn't spare time for a quiet, very British afternoon cuppa at Himalayan Hotel.\n\nA good place for an English style breakfast and snacks is Cafe Refuel in the outskirts of the town.\n\nA good place for affordable drinks and food is King Thai.\n\nKalimpong produces the only aged cheese made in India.
