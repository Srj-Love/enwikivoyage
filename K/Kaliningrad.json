Known by its German name of Koenigsberg then, the city was the capital of Prussia.\n\nKaliningrad was a hub for science and culture whizzes from Germany, Poland and Lithuania. It was home to renowned philosopher Immanuel Kant and prominent German writer Ernst Theodor Amadeus Hoffmann. Kant had such pride in his hometown that he barely left the place in his lifetime, declaring that he did not need to venture abroad because ships came to tell him stories.\n\nDestroyed in World War II and annexed to the USSR in 1946, the region was stripped of its German identity and was named after Mikhail Kalinin, a Russian communist leader. A highly militarised zone during the Soviet era, the area only opened to visitors about 20 years ago.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh =   0.4"],["febhigh =   1.2"],["marhigh =   5.4"],["aprhigh =   11.4"],["mayhigh =   17.6"],["junhigh =   20.5"],["julhigh =   22.1"],["aughigh =   22.0"],["sephigh =   17.0"],["octhigh =   11.8"],["novhigh =   5.4"],["dechigh =   2.1"],["janlow =   -4.3"],["feblow =   -3.9"],["marlow =   -1.3"],["aprlow =   2.6"],["maylow =   7.0"],["junlow =   10.8"],["jullow =   13.0"],["auglow =   12.6"],["seplow =   9.0"],["octlow =   5.1"],["novlow =   0.9"],["declow =   -2.4"],["janprecip =  62"],["febprecip =  46"],["marprecip =  45"],["aprprecip =  40"],["mayprecip =  51"],["junprecip =  78"],["julprecip =  74"],["augprecip =  84"],["sepprecip =  83"],["octprecip =  85"],["novprecip =  78"],["decprecip =  78"],["description = Average of Kaliningrad"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nThe best time to visit is in summer between June and August, when the temperature is around 20 to 25 deg C.
