The southern part is roughly the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Warmia-Masuria"]]}," region of Poland. Since 1945, it has been part of Russia. In 1525 the Duchy of Prussia was founded by the last High Master of the Teutonic Knights Albrecht of Brandenburg-Ansbach who became the first duke of Prussia. From 1618 in personal union with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brandenburg"]]},", the duchy was elevated to a kingdom in 1701.\n\nThough the united Kingdom of Prussia (with the capital ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Berlin"]]},") was a member state of the Holy Roman Empire and later the German Confederation, Prussia proper was not a part of Germany (or any other state) but an independent country until in 1871 when the German national state was established under Prussian leadership.  Prussia was thereby incorporated into Germany as its dominant and most powerful state.\n\nAfter ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Germany"]]},"'s defeat in WWII, East Prussia's native German-speaking population was forcibly expelled and the area was divided among three countries. The northern part with the capital ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kaliningrad"],["Königsberg"]]}," became the area of Kaliningrad Oblast, while the southern part was incorporated into ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Poland"]]},". A third fraction, the district north of the river Memel (",{"type":"''","value":["Memelland"]},") with the main city ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Klaipeda"]]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["Memel"]},"),  had previously been split from Prussia and incorporated into ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lithuania"]]}," after WWI, and this was done again after WWII. In the aftermath of WWII, all three areas were ethnically cleansed of the their native German speaking populations. \n\nBecause the German speaking inhabitants were forced out and all their property was confiscated, the population of Kaliningrad Oblast consists now mostly of Russian speaking people, but there are still a lot of traces of old German culture (for example, every city in the oblast has an authentic name in German) which, along with the presence of modern Russian culture, makes it an interesting destination for travelers.\n\nKaliningrad Oblast produces 90% of the world's amber.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nThe Russian language is spoken by more than 95% of Kaliningrad Oblast population.
