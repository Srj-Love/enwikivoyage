An added benefit is that you get to board a train which is passing through thane like Kalyan (Ky), Dombivali (Di), Ambarnath (A), Badlapur (Bl),Karjat(S), Kasara(N), Khopoli(Kh), thus avoiding the change over at Dadar.\n\nOther option if you are coming from the airport is, take an auto-rickshaw to Andheri station which is served by the Western Railway and buy a ticket to Thane. You need to take a southbound train towards Churchgate, get off at Dadar (which is the interchange point) if possible avoid peak hour journey if you are new in Mumbai specially between 8 and 11 am or between 6 and 8 pm, get on the Central Railway Line and then take a northbound train to Kalwa.
