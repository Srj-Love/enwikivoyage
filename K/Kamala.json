Although the southern end of the beach can get busy in the high season, the northern end is peaceful all year round. \"Rim Haad\" (",{"type":"''","value":["Beach Road"]},"), at the southern end, has a number of small 20-30 room hotels for the low\/medium budget traveller. Friendly service and village feel and a diversity of restaurants and small bars can be found on this small road. Cheaper food options\/market stalls can be found on the main Kamala Rd.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\nBy taxi, 500-600 baht from the airport.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get around "]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" See "]},"\nThe only two tourist attractions Kamala has to offer (besides the beach) are the Fantasea show and the Buddhist temple at the south end of the beach.\n\nAt the middle of the beach, there is a small park with a tsunami monument.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Do "]},"\nIf you are looking to spend most of the time on the beach enjoying the sea, this is a very good place to be. Beach is quite nice and is not too crowded. Sea floor is nice and sandy. In the afternoons the water spectacularly recedes leaving a blanket of rocks at the left end of the beach for local fishing and a beautiful swimming area at the right end of the beach.\n\nOn the beach, you won't be able to get around a Thai massage. These are offered at small stalls along the beach, and the rate seems fixed (300 baht\/hour). Even if you're not comfortable with a full body massage, don't miss out on a heavenly foot massage. Get one daily and help support the local economy while enjoying a pampering.\n\nThe Kamala wat is located at the south end of the beach and is almost unnoticeable. The temple and its grounds have been restored since the Boxing Day tsunami and the Buddhist locals and resident monks welcome curious foreigners. It was the Australian television program Backyard Blitz that helped restore the gardens of the wat after the tsunami. A memorial tree is placed in the garden with a dedication plaque and the walls of the main temple are a beautifully decorated story of Buddha. Visiting this wat can be an enlightening cultural experience. Pictures and events of the tsunami are displayed on a board for foreigners to see and the monks allow photos of the grounds as long as you're in the company of a local.\n\nThe extremely popular Phuket FantaSea is located in Kamala. Phuket FantaSea is an exuberant show\/cultural theme park that combines the rich heritage of Thailand with unique 4D effects and animals. The park is 140 acres and presents a 4000-seat restaurant offering a grand buffet of Thai and international cuisine and a shopping street offering local products. The park operates daily except Thursdays and opens at 20:30. ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.phuket-fantasea.com\/"]},"\n\nIf more entertainment is desired you can take a taxi to Patong; however taxis are unreasonably expensive ~500 baht one-way (but less if you bargain). Tuk-tuks are a simple and (sometimes) cheaper way to leave Kamala. Tuk-tuks to the more popular Patong cost around 300 baht. Some of the hotels provide an affordable shuttle to Patong.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Kamala Dive Center"]}," has half-day trips to dive sites around Kamala, like Kamala Rock, a boulder site with plenty of fish, Ko Weo- a small reef island, Tin Lizzy - a wreck of a dredger, and Tai Pau, a shallow sand bottom site.

Upon delivery, you should check all the seams.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Eat "]},"\nThere are quite a few restaurants directly on the beach. Usually they show some fresh fish and seafood on ice, where you can choose exactly what to eat. One of them offers a weekly barbecue, all you can eat. You should make a reservation in time to get a table, but actually, it's not worth it. In the village you also find an abundance of restaurants, also with the seafood in the front on ice.
