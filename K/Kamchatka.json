As such, the peninsula is vastly uninhabited wilderness where one can climb volcanoes, sport hunt for bears, visit geysers, spend hours in natural hot springs, or go fishing in wild rivers or off the coast.

In the 16th century, spurred by tales of a land of fire that was rich in fish and furs, Kamchatka was claimed by Muscovite Russia. Two settlements were built by Cossacks in 1697 as fur trading posts.\n\nThe peninsula was mapped during Vitus Bering's expedition to explore the Russian Far East and reach North America. In 1740 Bering reached Avacha Bay and laid the cornerstone for the settlement of Petropavlovsk, named after his two ships St. Peter and St. Paul.

Unfortunately, the Russians realized the city was a liability and when more invaders came a year later the city was abandoned and burnt to the ground. With the sale of the Kuril Islands to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Japan"]]}," and Alaska to the US, the peninsula waned in importance. Following World War II Kamchatka was deemed a military zone and was placed off limits to Russians (excluding residents) until 1989 and to foreigners until 1991.\n\nThe peninsula hosts the largest Russian nuclear submarine pen and submarine construction yard. A major event during the Cold War in the early 1980s was the intentional shooting down by the Soviet Union of an Korean Air (Flight 007) civilian airliner that inadvertently drifted off course when flying over an extremely sensitive military area in Kamchatka.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Kamchatka map.png"],["thumb"],["300px"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nThere are no roads connecting Kamchatka with other parts of Russia.
