A friendly proprietor who speaks Portuguese, but not much English or Japanese, runs this self-service place with a couple rice cookers containing Brazilian home cooking, including rice and feijoada that are absolutely delicious. The patrons will help you translate your requests from Japanese into Portuguese, but it's good to be able to at least say \"thank you\" for the meal â€” \"obrigado\" in Portuguese. A large plate of rice and feijoada, some other meat side dish, salad, and a bottle of water run only 830 yen. Head north-east from the station, down under the bridge, and walk for a couple hundred meters.
