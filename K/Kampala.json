You won't be in Kampala long before being propositioned by a boda driver. If you're not interested, a simple 'no' will get them to leave you alone. You can get most anywhere on the back of one for UGX3000-5000, but make sure to agree on the fare before the ride begins. Men usually ride facing forward while women are expected to ride side saddle; very risky. Females can get away with riding facing the front, but may be accused of riding \"like a man,\" though the locals are fairly understanding of female tourists doing this.\n\nBoda-bodas are extremely dangerous as their riders will do whatever it takes to get you to your destination quickly. Expect to dart in front of and against traffic and even though crowds of pedestrians when necessary. Boda-boda accidents account for most of the hospital visits and traffic fatalities in Kampala; you have been warned!\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Boda-Boda-Uganda.jpg"],["thumb"],["Boda Bodas"]]},"Boda-bodas got their name from the bicycle taxis that operated at some of the busy border crossing points. Buses had to discharge their passengers at the exit border control, who then had to walk to the entry border control. The distance across no man's land at some borders can be considerable. Hence the bicycle taxis would cry \"boda-boda\" (a corruption of the English \"border to border\") to the weary travellers. These bicycle taxis can still be found in most smaller Ugandan towns, however, in Kampala they have been replaced by motorcycles. Boda-bodas charge UGX3000-5000 for trips within Kampala (foreigner price; correct at July 2011). It is almost impossible to get anywhere for under UGX2000, and longer trips may run you up to UGX7000.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By matatu"]},"\nMatatus are a series of minibuses that follow relatively pre-set routes all over the city and many other parts of the country. Confusingly, they are known as taxis in Uganda. It might be a bit confusing in the beginning how to use the matatus to efficiently get where you want to go, but it's really not so difficult. \n\nTheir routes usually go between the city centre and some suburb. The majority of matatus to\/from the suburbs leave\/finish inside or around the\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name= old taxi park"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat= 0.31201"],["long= 32.57698"],["zoom= 16"]]},"\nSome, e.g. those going along Ggaba road to Kabalagala, Kansanga, Bbunga, Ggaba and Munyonyo, leave inside the \n",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Cooper Complex"],["lat=0.31057"],["long=32.57621"]]},"\nThis can be hard to find since that's basically inside a shopping mall.

Matatus that leave the area around the park are hence full, which makes it difficult to hop on a matatu at other places in the city centre. Unless you're very lucky, you'll have to go to where the matatus start in order to leave the city centre.\n\nEach matatu has a driver and a conductor. Don't be frightened if you can't understand what they're saying. Ask one of them for your destination and you'll be told yes or no. When you get in, expect to be squeezed. Each vehicle is licensed to carry 14 people, but they will pack in as many will fit (and their belongings). If you don't like this it's a good idea to sit in the back of the vehicle, since usually the squeezing is limited to the first 2 rows. Once the matatu starts moving people can get off at any time. When you reach your destination, tell your conductor \"Stage\" and they will stop the van. \n\nWhenever a matatu has empty space the driver will go slowly and honk repeatedly. If you want to get on, just make some gesture and it will slow further down and shout out the destination, just shout your destination as response and they will pick you up if it's along the way. There are often also a number of further staging points along the way where the driver will again stop and wait until they can fill the vehicle. This can take a few seconds or several minutes; just be patient. In some cases drivers won't take you if you only go relatively short distances, since that will mean they'll risk losing money if they can't fill your place quickly once you're dropped. You pay the conductor when you exit, although some people give the conductor money while the vehicle is moving so that he can make change ahead of time. The normal fare is UGX1000-1500 per person when driving into the city (Mar 2014).\n\nGoing with a matatu is generally cheap, safe, slow and nice. Ugandans are often happy to start up a conversation or help you out, and if the conductor tries to overcharge you or make you take an inefficient route, passengers are likely to point that out to you and scold him. People also complain if a driver takes too long to wait for passengers or drives recklessly and will even collectively quit the van in protest if a driver drives too bad.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By special hire"]},"\nIf you aren't up for the thrill of the bodas and don't have time for a matatu, taxis, also called special hires, are readily available at most central locations.

If you do decide to use them regularly consider buying a helmet (they are not provided by the driver).  Although it defies logic at first glance, you might want to consider taking a boda-boda in which the driver does not have a helmet.  Drivers without helmets tend to drive slower, and as they never have helmets for the passengers, this means that you are a bit safer.\n\nDon't plan on using your credit card.  If it is accepted, there is a good chance of fraud. Safer is withdrawing money from ATM's using your VISA-card.  Many ATMs take VISA.  Stanbic is the only bank that takes MasterCard branded cards.\n\nTo stay safe, also be aware of the large number of prostitutes in Rock Garden at Speke Hotel.

A few may still also leave from the old taxi park. There are many companies (almost 100) that run larger tour buses that leave from numerous bus terminals\/stations surrounding the new taxi park, or for buses going east into Kenya at De Winton Road.

As of March 2014, the following bus companies are not operating anymore:  Scandinavia Express, Gagaa coaches, Kampala Coach, Akamba Bus Services...  (Please update this list!). If you want to go somewhere it is best to try to find a phone number where you can confirm departures or just ask around where buses going there and there leave, and go there early in the morning. Keep in mind that some companies will consistently employ bad drivers, and accidents do happen, so it is worth using a company that has a good reputation (some of which should be listed below). Also, while the minibuses (matatus) are relatively safe when traveling in Kampala's crowded and slow moving traffic, they are generally considered relatively unsafe on the fast roads in the countryside populated by heavy trucks and buses. Bigger buses are safer, especially since at least some of them are run by larger companies that care about their reputation and are better regulated\/monitored by the government.
