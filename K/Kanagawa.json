There is also a \"famous\" foot Onsen in Yugawara along with some shrines and temples. Another easy day hike is Mount Oyama, which can be accessed from Isehara Station on the Odakyu-Odawara Line. A bus runs from Isehara Station to the bottom of a cable car station next to the Oyama-dera Shrine. At the top of the cable car, the trail to the peak of the mountain starts, and takes approximately an hour and a half for the average hiker. At the summit, one can get a view of the coastal towns and ocean, the other Tanzawa Mountains, and Mt. Fuji on a good day. The Oyamaafuri Shrine is also located at the top.\n\nIf you like beaches, Enoshima is the most popular one, and gets very crowded in the summer time. Windsurfing is a popular activity there, as the waves are rarely big enough for regular surfing due to the surrounding landmass. Enoshima itself is the island right next to the beach connected by a 600 meter bridge. There is a tower at the top of the island, where you can get a view of Mt. Fuji, the ocean, Oshima, and the Shonan Coast (the stretch of beaches in Kanagawa). To the west of Enoshima, across the Katase River, is Chigasaki Beach, which is also very famous. It is a small, but relaxing beach. There is a big symbol \"C\" for Chigasaki, which is a popular picture taking spot. In August, they have a Fireworks Festival.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"''","value":["Shirasu"]}," (baby sardine) pizza（シラスピザ） at Enoshima Aquarium（えのすい）."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Benten Pizza"]},", 2-5-17 Enoshima, on the road to the cave. - The cafe has beautiful views and a relaxing atmosphere.
