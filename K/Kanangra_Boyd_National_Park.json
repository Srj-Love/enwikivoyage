It was intended to be part of the Oberon stock route, where, in the advent of Australia being invaded by the Japanese cattle, sheep and possibly pigs would be driven, via Burragorang valley to Oberon - crossing the Kanangra Plateau. The battle of Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands where the Japanese suffered their first defeat (1942) stopped the Japanese thrust and the Oberon stock route was not needed. \n\nYou can still drive the stock route in a 2WD vehicle towards Yerranderie, and old ghost town is now privately owned and run for tourism. It isn't a through route though.\n\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Kanangra winter wonderland.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["Kanangra Boynd under snow"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nThe only road is an unpaved dirt road which is very bumpy at times, but nonetheless accessible by 2WD.
