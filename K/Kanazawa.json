Kyoto's offerings of temples and shrines are all very well, but Japanese history and culture is not just about them. The samurai, the merchants, the geisha, and the lords have all left their mark on Kanazawa in a compact, easily navigable central area. Kanazawa is part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a City of Crafts and Folk Art.

For those using Kanazawa as a base to explore the Hokuriku and Hida regions, renting a car would be a good idea as public transport between some of the more far-flung areas is far and few between. \n\nRemember that a valid Japanese or Geneva Convention International Driver's License must be carried at all times, and that driving while drunk results in at best some extremely stiff fines: up to ¥300,000 and instant loss of license.
