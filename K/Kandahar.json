Kandahār is a border province connecting the southern region to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pakistan"],["Pakistan's"]]}," Balouchistan province through Chaman and used to be the capital of Afghanistan until the late 17th century. It is considered to be an economic and political hub of Afghanistan and has always played a major role in the history of Afghanistan. \n\nMost of its inhabitants are Pashtuns (Pashto: پښتون Paṣ̌tun, Pax̌tun). Many Afghan rulers such as; Ahmad Shah Durrani, Mirwais Khan Hotak, King Amanullah Khan, King Nadar Khan, and King Zahir Shah have originated from Kandahar.\n\nKandahar is surrounded by mountains. The capital is Kandahār, located in the south of the country at about 1,005 m (3,297 feet) above sea level. The Arghandab River runs along the west of the city. The Ring of Rivers lies alongside the city and lush green gardens enhance the natural beauty of the city. \n\nThe majority of Kandahār people are engaged in agricultural endeavour. The province has a population of nearly 913,000, with over 800,000 living in its capital city.\n\nKandahār is a major trading center for sheep, wool, cotton, silk, felt, food grains, dried fruit, fresh fruit including pomegranates and grapes, and tobacco. The city has canning plants and facilities for drying, and packing fruit. \n\nThere is an international airport in Kandahār and roads provide links to Tareen Kot in the north, Quetta in Pakistan in the south.
