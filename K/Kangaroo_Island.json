The island is 160 kilometers across, and has an abundance of wildlife, natural scenery, wineries and beaches.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nKangaroo Island was separated from the mainland around 10,000 years ago.  It was first explored by Matthew Flinders in 1802 whilst en route from UK to Sydney.  He named the island in honour of the feast of Kangaroo he and his crew enjoyed on the island. More extensive mapping (especially of the south coast) was done by the French explorer Nicolas Baudin  which is why a number of geographical features have French names.\n\nWhile there is evidence of Aboriginal people living on the island as long as 16,000 years ago, the island has not been inhabited by Aboriginal people for at least 2,000 years.  From 1803 the island was visited by sealers and whalers, exploiting the natural resources of the island.  In addition, a number of \"independent\" settlers arrived - thought to be mainly escaped convicts and those looking for a lifestyle unencumbered by regulation - took up residence between 1803 and the start of official settlement in 1836.\n\nIn 1836 Kingscote became the first settlement in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South Australia"]]}," and significant parts of the island were opened up for farming. Sealing had just about finished by this time, with seals on many of the islands beaches completely wiped out.\n\nFrom the late 1800s parts of the island were being actively preserved.  Flinders Chase National Park was proclaimed in 1912. During the 1920s the island was seen as an opportunity to preserve species that were threatened on mainland Australia, with attempts at introducing several, including koalas.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Geography"]},"\n\nThe island is 160km wide (east to west) and around 50km from top to bottom at its widest.  The north of the island has more protected seas, with the south generally having larger waves, higher cliffs and stronger currents.  There are still some white sandy beaches and inlets on the south, though, such as Pennington Bay, d'Estrees Bay, Bales Bay and Hanson Bay.\n\nThe main settlements are within an hour of each other on the east, with more remote areas in the west.\n\nThe cliffs and bays can be spectacular, and there are interesting geological formations along the south, the most popular to visit being Admirals Arch and the Remarkable Rocks.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and Fauna"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Admiral's Arch.jpg"],["right"],["Admiral's Arch"],["thumb"]]},"\nKI has abundant wildlife and large sections of untouched forest. Many species for which Australia is famous for can be found here like kangaroos, wallabies, koalas, and penguins.  There are plenty of opportunities to see these animals close up in their natural habitat.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Visitor Information"]},"\n\nThe Gateway Visitor Information Centre is located in Penneshaw. The centre can provide maps, brochures, tour times, costs and can help to make bookings.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Towns"]},"\nThere are four significant settlements on Kangaroo Island:\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Kingscote"]}," is the biggest town on the island, around 60km or just under an hours drive from Penneshaw.

The sole airport on the island is also at Kingscote.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Penneshaw"]}," is at the east of the island. This is the place where the ferries arrive.  Again, there is a supermarket, pub with food and a view, a pizza place, and a couple of other food choices.  It has a more attractive cliff-side setting than Kingscote. Fuel is available and banking can be done at the Post Office.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Parndana"]}," is in the centre of the island and serving the farming community.

Ferries carry cars and passengers.  They have a small cafe and bar on board, selling snacks and small meals during the trip.  There is also a cafe at the Cape Jervis end, selling a similar range, which is open for departures but not necessarily for late arrivals.\n\nStandby travel is often not available for cars, especially on the popular afternoon evening services.  You really need to book ahead even in the off-season.\n\nFor a short trip, it can get quite rough.  The route goes from peninsula to peninsula, and doesn't spend any time in a protected area.

As always, consider the risk and insurance, against the cost and convenience.\n\nBook ahead if you are renting a car on the island.  The consequences of them being sold out when you arrive are that you don't go anywhere.\n\nIt is important to clarify insurance arrangements when hiring a car as both Hertz and Budget have more complicated systems on the island than on the mainland. This is due to a high number of collisions with animals, in particular during the late afternoon, evening, and early morning.  Again, consider travel insurance to overcome the limitations of the rental car policy.

Slow down (less than 80 km\/h is advised) specifically around dusk and dawn but also during the night since wildlife is most active at this time. None of the car rental services cover damage caused by collision with animals at night so be extremely careful. Road conditions are good - most roads are sealed - though some tourist locations can only be reached on unsealed roads which are usually well graded. Unsealed roads are often made with an ironstone top which can making cars skid when turning or stopping at speed. Drivers inexperienced on unsealed roads should be extremely careful during wet conditions as traction in a standard two wheel drive vehicle is very poor. The island itself is approx 150km x 50km; allow plenty of time to travel to your destination.\n\nPeninsula tiger snakes are common in parts.  Particular in areas around Cape Willoughby - where some grassy areas are even closed to the public.
