The metropolitan area has a population of 2 million. The center of the city is in Kansas City, Missouri, often called \"KCMO\" locally, which is the largest city in Missouri with a population around 450,000. Across the state border is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kansas City (Kansas)"],["Kansas City, Kansas"]]},", often called \"KCK\" by locals, which has a population of 150,000. There are also a number of suburbs on both sides of the border.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Districts"]},"\nKansas City, Missouri, is covered by this main article. There is another article:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kansas City (Kansas)"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nKansas City is a city that tends to hide itself from tourists. Having reportedly more boulevards than ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Paris"]]}," and more fountains than any other city in the world except for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rome"]]},", it can be a beautiful city, too. It is also unique, in that it is split down the middle by the state line of Kansas and Missouri.\n\nThe suburbs are largely south of the central city, though the area north of the Missouri River (known locally as the Northland) is beginning to experience growth similar to the south. Numbering of east\/west streets begins at the Missouri River with the east\/west division occurring at Main Street. Westport is around 40th St., the Plaza at 47th St., Brookside at 55th, and Waldo beginning around Gregory (71st St.).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nDue to the lack of any large body of water nearby, KC experiences a continental climate with large swings and extremes of temperature. Winters vary from mild to very cold, with significant snow at times, and temperatures occasionally dipping to single digits and below 0°F (-18°C). Snow accumulation occurs 3-5 times per year, on average, sometimes exceeding a foot (31 cm). KC enjoys very pleasant spring and autumn weather, but suffers hot, humid summers. It is not uncommon for the temperature to stay above 90°F (32°C) for weeks at a time, during July and August. Because of the heat, almost all buildings in KC are equipped with air conditioning. While KC has relatively high humidity, the most common weather is clear with almost completely blue skies. The majority of the rain falls in Apr-Jun, but even in these wettest months, rain is light, compared to other cities in the region.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Downtown"]},"\n\nDowntown Kansas City is generally defined as the areas including the River Market, the central business district (the \"Loop\"), the Crossroads Arts District, Crown Center and Union Station.\n\nAfter years of neglect and decay in the 1980s and 1990s, downtown is making a comeback. Many once-abandoned buildings in downtown have been (or are being) rebuilt into high-dollar condominiums and loft apartments. The demand for residences downtown is quite high. In October of 2007, the Sprint Center sports arena was completed, bringing a modern sports and entertainment venue to the downtown core. The Power and Light District was constructed and opened in 2008. The \"P&L\" District comprises 5 high rise residential and office towers, with many clubs, bars, restaurants, and shops on the lower floors. A new performing arts center south of the convention center area opened in 2011.\n\nThe ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.downtownkc.org Downtown Council"]}," operates security and cleaning\/maintenance crews, who keep downtown's streets clean and serve as a security presence. Downtown is one of the safest areas of the city, both day and night.\n\nTraveling north to south, the ",{"type":"'''","value":["River Market"]}," is the first neighborhood one encounters, south of the banks of the Missouri River. A burgeoning urban neighborhood, it houses many shops, restaurants, bars, and a very active farmers' market that convenes every Saturday, even in winter.\n\nThe expressways form a loop around the ",{"type":"'''","value":["central business district"]}," (CBD). Crossing the north segment of the loop takes you from the River Market to the CBD. This is where Kansas City's famed skyline reaches its greatest heights, further accentuated by its position on top of a sizable hill. The CBD has the principal concentration of white-collar employment in the metro area. The world headquarters for H&R Block is located here, within the P and L District.\n\nFrom here, crossing the south segment of the loop will bring a visitor into the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Crossroads Arts District"]},", which is a regional center for art, culture, and nightlife.\n\nWhen crossing Pershing, ",{"type":"'''","value":["Union Station"]}," and Crown Center are seen, which houses shops, restaurants, and offices, including the world headquarters of Hallmark.
