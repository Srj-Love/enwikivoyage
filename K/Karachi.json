The largest city, and unarguably the most important, Karachi was the original capital of the nation. The sprawling huge metropolis has grown into the commercial, transport and political hub of the country, and operates the largest and busiest ports in the country. The growth rate of the city propels it forward onto the global stage and Karachi is on its way to becoming a massively influential player.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Karachi sky line.jpg"],["thumb"],["350px"],["Karachi skyline"]]},"\nKarachi offers a remarkable variety of attractions and activities – from sunny, sandy beaches and scurf-infested old colonial buildings, still preserved and in some cases inhabited, to traditional bazaars and modern shopping malls. Upscale luxury hotels overlook modish restaurants with flavors from all over the nation and much of the world. These and so much more make the city a hot­spot for both local and tourist activity.\n\nThe remarkable skyline is but one of the wonderful attractions of the city, and this grand South Asian city holds many surprises for anyone who decides to seek them out. Karachi is home to over 23 million inhabitants, from all over the country and even abroad, and is a vibrant melting pot of cultures and ideas. Visitors will be met with a new and exciting experience around each corner, and on every visit. The city is known as the \"City of the Quaid\", due to the fact that it is the city where the founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, lived and died. Alternatively, due to the liveliness, at all hours, of the city, Karachi is now more popularly and affectionately referred to as the \"City of Lights\".\n\nThe most diverse and cosmopolitan city of Pakistan, Karachi lives and breathes with a style of its own. The most advanced city of the nation, it often blazes forward as an example of the Pakistan to come, and because of its diverse make­up, is sometimes described as a mini-Pakistan, where you can find representatives of every Pakistani culture. Karachi is the third most populous city in the world, and the largest among the Muslim world. Due to this and its melting pot nature, the pace of life is faster and the social attitudes more liberal than elsewhere in the nation, and growth rate of the city makes it an evolving hub where people from different backgrounds meet and shape the future of both the city and Pakistan itself.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Understand "]},"\n:",{"type":"''","value":["\"You will yet be the glory of the East; would that I could come again, Karachi, to see you in your grandeur\""]}," ",{"type":"<","value":["small",["— Charles James Napier, Commissioners of Sind (1843–1847)"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["Who're Muhajir?"],["Muhajir is a term used in Pakistan to describe the Muslim immigrants originally from India who migrated to Pakistan and chose to settle in different parts of the country but mostly in Sindh and particularly Karachi following the independence in 1947.

Pakistan's wealthiest city is surprisingly the cheapest and most inexpensive city in the world as well according to some estimates. Karachi is notable for its architecture, music scene, media links, financial and commercial output, social impact, and transport connections. Today it is ranked as a beta world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. As one of the most rapidly growing cities in the world, Karachi faces challenges that are central to many developing metropolises, including traffic congestion, pollution, poverty and street crime.

The public transport system was quite good and a number of urban tramway systems used to operate throughout the city as well a local train service, the \"Karachi Circular Railway\", was started in 1969 with the aim of providing better transportation facilities to the people of Karachi. The Karachi-Mumbai Ferry Service was also in operational until 1965, and the Karachi airport was served by many major airlines and was ranked among the busiest airports in the world at the time. The city was the country's most liberal and secular and had more than five hundred cinemas, over three dozen bustling night clubs, and numerous bars and liquor shops scattered throughout the city. It became the entertainment capital in its golden days and, although drugs were easily available and alcohol and gambling were legal, there was comparatively less crime as compared to today. The crime rate was very low and gun crime was nonexistent as well there was no political and ethnical violence. Surprisingly, women used to wear western clothes in an Islamic country, and even walking alone late at night was not uncommon. By the late 1960s, tourism as an industry in the city was flourishing and it become a hotspot for international tourists with many young western travellers and \"Hippy\" types used to venture down to the city. In brief, Karachi was used to be reflecting an image of an truly international city of the world and a very different city to what it became many years later and for what it is known today."]]},"\nThe earliest history of the area where Karachi is today stands was known as \"Krokola\" and \"Ramya\" to the ancient Greeks. In the Ancient period of 327–325 BC, Alexander the Great used the city to camp and prepare a fleet for Babylonia after completing his campaign in the Indus Valley. Karachi was later known to the Arabs as \"Debal\", the place where Muhammad bin Qasim led his conquering force into South Asia in 712 AD. During the Tarkhan Dynasty (1554 to 1591 AD) and under the rule of the Mughal administrator of Sindh, Mirza Ghazi Beg, the city was well fortified against Portuguese colonial incursions in Sindh. In 1568 the city was attacked by the Portuguese Admiral Fernão Mendes Pinto in an attempt to capture or destroy the Ottoman vessels anchored in the city.\n\nThe modern-day history of Karachi begins during the reign of the Kalhora Dynasty (1701–1782), when an old Sindhi Balochi fisher-woman, Mai Kolachi, took up residence in the city to start a family and the city started as a fishing settlement and became a trading centre. The city was then called \"Kolachi-jo-Goth\" (translated as \"The Village of Kolachi\" in Sindhi language) in 1729. The name Karachee appears for the first time in a 1742 document of the Dutch East India Company, when a ship, the Ridderkerk, was shipwrecked along the coast nearby. In 1795, the city passed from the control of the Khan of Kalat to the Talpur rulers of Sindh. During the Talpur Period (1795–1839), the city was an integral part of the Talpur dynasty.\nIn the late 18th century, Karachi gained importance when it started to trade with Persian Gulf and a small fort was constructed for its protection which had two main gateways: one facing the sea, known as Khaara Darwaaza (Brackish Gate) and the other facing the adjoining Lyari river, known as the Meetha Darwaaza (Sweet Gate). The location of these gates corresponds to the present-day city localities of Khaara-dar (Khaara Darwaaza) and Meetha-dar (Meetha Darwaaza) respectively.\n\nThe city was developed into an important port when it had caught the attention of the British East India Company who, after sending a couple of exploratory missions to the area, conquered the Sindh on 3 Feb 1839 and gained control of the region. During the early Company Rule, Karachi was known as Khurachee Scinde (i.e. Karachi, Sindh) and the population of the city was 15,000 in 1838. The city became part of British India in 1843, after which it was made the capital of Sindh in the late 1840s. The British realised the importance of the city as a military cantonment and rapidly developed its harbour for shipping, and started to develop the city. The foundations of a city municipal government were laid down in 1852 and infrastructure development was undertaken. New businesses started opening up and the population of the town began rising rapidly. British colonialists embarked on a number of public works of sanitation and transportation and Karachi quickly turned into a city, making true the famous quote by Napier who is known to have said on his departure in 1847: ",{"type":"''","value":["Would that I could come again to see you in your grandeur!"]},"\nDuring the British Raj, the city was the largest urban centre in present-day Pakistan and was connected to the rest of British India by rail link and Karachi was then enjoying an economic boom: the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 meant the city was 200 nautical miles closer to Europe for shipping than Bombay (now called Mumbai). The constant developments in the city resulted in a large influx of economic migrants. The population of the city was about 105,000 by the end of the 19th century, with a cosmopolitan mix of different nationalities. However, before the year 1880, the majority of the population in Karachi consisted of the indigenous Sindhis and Balochis (who spoke Sindhi as their mother tongue). In 1876, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, was born in the city.\n\nFollowing the bloody partition of the British Raj and the independence of Pakistan, rapid growth occurred in the city and it had became the focus for settlement by Muslim migrants from India, and hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees from India sought refuge and the population has exploded from about 450,000 to an estimated 23.5 million today. Their settlement in Karachi gave the city its northern Indian atmosphere, as well expanded the city's population and transformed its demographics and economy. There were 50% Hindu population in the city before the partition in 1947 which later decreased to only 2% within 10 year period in 1951 whereas Muslim population exceeds to 95% in 1951 which was previously only 40% before the partition of sub-continenet.\n\nKarachi was chosen as the capital of Pakistan from 1947–1958 and became a bustling metropolis, with beautiful classical and colonial European styled buildings lining the city’s thoroughfares. Over the next several decades it was one of the fastest growing cities in the world. In 1958, the capital was moved from Karachi to Rawalpindi and then later moved to the newly built Islamabad in 1960. A huge crowd of illegal refugees from around the world continued to flock into the city which made the city’s population continue to grow and exceed the capacity of its creaking infrastructure. During the 1960s, Pakistan was seen as an economic role model around the world and that was the golden age of Karachi. Many countries sought to emulate Pakistan's economic planning strategy; one of them, South Korea, copied the country's second \"Five-Year Plan\", and the World Financial Centre in Seoul is designed and modelled after Karachi. \n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, the city saw an influx of illegal Afghan refugees from the Soviet war in Afghanistan moving into Karachi and as of 2010, the number of illegal aliens in Karachi was estimated to be between 1.6 and 2 million people along with thousands of nationals from many other countries who are living illegally in Karachi without proper documentation. Political tensions and ethnic violence between the Muhajir and local groups such as ethnic Sindhis and Punjabis erupted across the city and the city was wracked with political violence. As a result, the Pakistani army was deployed to restore peace in the city. The period from 1992 to 1994 is regarded as the bloodiest period in the history of the city, when the Army commenced its \"Operation Clean-up\" against the Mohajir Qaumi Movement. The city has been badly hit by militancy since the mid 1980s, first by ethnic militia MQM and then by fundamentalists since 1995, and militancy has damaged the city enormously. Many Karachiities believe the violence and tension in their city as part of a conspiracy. However, Karachi continues to be an important financial and industrial centre and handles most of the overseas trade of Pakistan, and it accounts for a lion's share of the GDP of the country.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Climate "]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh =   25.6"],["febhigh =   26.4"],["marhigh =   28.8"],["aprhigh =   30.6"],["mayhigh =   32.3"],["junhigh =   33.3"],["julhigh =   32.2"],["aughigh =   30.8"],["sephigh =   30.7"],["octhigh =   31.6"],["novhigh =   30.5"],["dechigh =   27.3"],["janlow =   14.1"],["feblow =   15.9"],["marlow =   20.3"],["aprlow =   23.7"],["maylow =   26.1"],["junlow =   27.9"],["jullow =   27.4"],["auglow =   26.2"],["seplow =   25.3"],["octlow =   23.5"],["novlow =   20.0"],["declow =   15.7"],["description = Check ",{"type":"'''","value":["Karachi's weather forecast"]}," at ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/weather\/1174872 BBC Weather"]}]]},"\n\nKarachi has a relatively mild and an arid climate — albeit a moderate version of this climate — pretty much throughout the year because the city rests on the coast. Karachi has two main seasons; summer and winter, while spring and autumn are very short. The city enjoys a tropical climate encompassing warm and humid summers while the mild and dry winters; the proximity to the sea maintains humidity levels at a near-constant high and cool sea breezes relieve the heat of the summer months however summer season persists for longest period during the year. Due to the high temperatures during the summer (ranging from 30-44°C from April to October), the winter season that last from November to March, are the best times to visit Karachi. Most rainfall occurs during the rainy season of monsoon occurs in Summer from July to August, occasionally featuring lengthy spells of continuous rain. The highest ever recorded temperature in Karachi is 47.8°C while the lowest is 0°C.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Politics"]},"\nThe demographics of Karachi are important as most politics in Karachi is driven and influenced by ethnic affiliations. Karachi has been a traditional stronghold and birthplace of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, generally known as MQM. MQM is a secular political party mainly representing Muhajirs. Originally started as a ethnic-based student organisation under the name of All Pakistan Muhajir Student Organization (APMSO) in 1978 by Altaf Hussain in the city's well known university Karachi University where he was a student. Later it renamed Muhajir Qaumi Movement in 1984 and started working as a proper political party to represent the Muhajir community and to protect them who see themselves as the victims of discrimination and inequity. In 1997, MQM replaced the term \"Muhajir\" in its name with Muttahida (Urdu for \"United\") thus welcoming all ethnic groups of Pakistan into its folds. \n\nMQM in the past and even today often accused for causing terrorism and creating widespread political violence in the city and various crackdown has been launched against the party officials  amongst the major ones are Operation Clean-up from 1992 to 1994 during the government of Nawaz Sharif, which is regarded as the bloodiest period in Karachi's history. Since 1992, the leader of MQM left the country as a arrest warrant was issued for him and self-imposed exile in London. The party is often labelled as anti-Pakistan and fascist by critics.\n\nOver the years, MQM keep switching forming alliances with ruling parties in federal government of Islamabad in order to remain in power and to establish provincial government in Sindh. Today, MQM is currently the fourth largest political party in Pakistan and holds the most number of seats from Karachi in terms of both provincial and federal level due to which it holds strong mobilizing potential in Karachi as well in some parts of Sindh, having traditionally been the dominant political force in the city. The party have a larger mandate in urban Sindh including Karachi in comparison to Pakistan's second largest party PPP, who to some extent, consider MQM a rival and whose centre of gravity always lies in Sindh as Sindh is considered home province to the party but the stronghold of the party has been significantly reduced in urban areas of Sindh after the emergence and continued popularity of MQM and now majority of PPP's support come from rural areas of Sindh only where it has maintained a large vote bank. PPP has always managed to succeed in gaining power in provincial government of Sindh while on the national front, has remained into power in the federal government for five times since its foundation in 1967 by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto who remained the 4th President of Pakistan and later the 9th Prime Minister of Pakistan.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Culture "]},"\nOn the fringe of the Indian Ocean, the city is unarguably Pakistan's diverse melting pot, a mingling of old and new, east and west — a confluence of people from various parts of Pakistan as well from all over the world. With a regular influx of immigrants from rest of Pakistan, the residents who're called \"Karachiites\" have shown remarkable tolerance towards other cultures, making it a true cultural melting pot and therefore, everyday lifestyle of Karachi differs substantially from that of other cities in Pakistan. Karachi's culture is characterized by the blending of Middle Eastern, Central Asian, South Asian and Western influences, as well as the city's status as a major international business centre. As a whole, there is considerable diversity in culture, and this diversity has produced a unique cultural amalgam of its own type. The city has a cosmopolitan population composed of many ethnolinguistic groups and hosts the largest middle class stratum of the country. The city credits its growth to the mixed populations of economic and political migrants along with refugees from different national, provincial, linguistic and religious origins, who come to the city to settle permanently. Large numbers of non-Muslims live in Karachi compared to other Pakistan cities.\n\nThe entrepreneurial spirit and pulsing pace of life is a sharp contrast to much of Pakistan. Stunned by Karachi's diverse demographics, the American political scientist and South Asia expert Stephen P. Cohen once stated that if Karachi's ethnic groups \"got along well, it would be an amazingly complex city, a lot like New York.\" It can be comparable to Asia's other largest city, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mumbai"]]},", with whom the city shares many similarities due to fact both having been British colonies in the past. Karachi was built in successive waves of migrations with more than a million new inhabitants pouring in each year, it's not surprising that the stretch marks are showing in one of the largest and most rapidly growing cities in the world. The neighborhoods acquired their character from the communities that settled there first. These neighborhoods are too numerous to list and there is no commonly accepted way to group these neighborhoods into larger districts. But roughly, the city developed from the south to the north.\n\nKarachi also boasts one of the biggest underground music scenes in the country, where traditional musical influences blend with modern, Western style to create a unique brand of fusion music. This style of music has been very popular all across Pakistan and is utilised by most of the nation's up-and-coming musical artists. Many of the nation's emerging musicians have based themselves in Karachi because of excellent employment opportunities in the burgeoning entertainment industry of Karachi. In-fact Karachi has also produced many renowned artists. Many of the nation's fresh musical acts can be found in cafes, restaurants and concerts across Karachi.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By plane "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Jinnah International Airport.jpg"],["thumb"],["Bird's-eye view of Airport"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Karachi Jinnah Airport.jpg"],["thumb"],["Karachi airport building"]]},"\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.karachiairport.com.pk\/ ",{"type":"'''","value":["Jinnah International Airport"]}]},", (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["KHI"]]},"), is Pakistan's busiest and largest international and domestic airport.

The two satellite concourses also supplement the departure lounges of the terminal building. The lower level of the terminal is for arriving passengers, where a dedicated lane of taxis is situated just outside the terminal building for arriving passengers whilst the upper level of the terminal is for passengers departing.\n\nFacilities in the airport include food kiosks such as McDonald's and Butlers Chocolate Cafe. There are also a number of Bank kiosks, ATMs, Money Exchange counters, Wi-Fi, Free Internet kiosk (in Departures), mosques, coffee shops and many gift, a medical store, convenience stores, sweet shops, mobile recharging points, and snack counters. There is a big duty-free shop selling rugs, carpets, sports goods, medical instruments, onyx, gems and many more at cheap prices but it doesn't sell alcohol. Left-luggage facilities are also available within the terminal for those wishing to store baggage. Free trolleys and Dedicated Porter Services are available at Rs100 for domestic flight passengers and Rs 200 for international flight passengers. Assistance for the disabled is available on request from the airline prior to departure. Wheelchairs and wheelchair assistance can be found from desks in the arrival and departure areas of the terminal. Airport's CIP Lounge can be used for free by all first\/business class passengers and credit card holders including their guests on all outbound flights while Barclays and UBL have separate lounges for their credit card customers. There is also PIA Business Class Lounge next to CIP Lounge. The facilities at Airport's CIP Lounge includes a comfortable sitting area to relax in, access to leading TV Channels, free wifi, a wide range of snacks and beverages for free, newspapers, magazines, shower, fax, telephone and mobile charging facilities. There is an on-site McDonalds restaurant outside the main terminal building as well.\n\nImmigration and customs procedures are often a lengthy process at Karachi airport with Immigration always hectic with long lanes especially at the Pakistani passport counters, during peak hours which are usually at early morning time, and can take a notoriously long time (more than 45 minutes). In the immigration hall there are supposed to be separate queues for foreign travellers; passengers with children and unaccompanied children; business travellers. However, usually rules are bluntly ignored to fasten the immigration process and those lines are occupied by everyone indiscriminately – which makes for foreign travellers and business travellers a exhausting experience.\n\nAs you arrive at the baggage carousel you will find free trolleys as well as a host of porters vying for your attention to carry your luggage. It is best to settle the tip before you engage one, however. Normally Rs 100 will satisfy most of them. If you're departing, be prepared for long delays through security.

Located near Dr Daud Pota Rd in Saddar, the station building has been declared as ‘Protected Heritage’ by the Government of Sindh which makes it an attraction in itself. The railway station has all the facilities expected of a large station: a large car parking lot, ATM machines, food and drink stalls and book shop kiosks on the platforms.

You meet new people and get to see unexpected things. It's not very hard to find a mode of transportation and if you know what you are doing, it is very easy to get around. Getting around Karachi is not difficult and transportation is not expensive as compared to other mega cities of the world and you only have to follow proper directions to save your valuable time and money. Most of Karachi's inhabitants rely on public transport to and from their workplace and do ride in a taxi and auto-rickshaw at least once in the city. If you are not used to Pakistani roads, an auto-rickshaw ride can be a heart-stopping, death-defying, laws-of-physics-bending. Feel real adventure in a vehicle that feels like it might fall apart at a speed over 30 km\/h with a driver who thinks he's Schumacher.\n\nTravelling inside the city at peak times (08:00-10:00 and 17:30-19:00) takes a lot of time, with frequent road blocks and traffic congestion but still there are side roads and crossroads which can be useful to avoid traffic blocks.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By foot "]},"\nWalking is not only the most environmentally friendly way to see a place, it is also undoubtedly the best way, as it allows one to experience its rich ambiance and charms first hand, but much of Karachi is quite pedestrian-hostile with rarely marked crosswalks in the city and road signs are not good either. But, if you really want to walk around, always ensure you walk on the footpath, or if one isn't available, as far to the side of the road as possible and on the right facing on-coming traffic. City is big and distances are long which makes places of interest scattered far and wide all over the city but sometimes, walking in the city may actually be the fastest way to get from point A to point B particularly in the densely packed downtown areas of the city and the narrow streets of the city where walking is actually a favoured way to get around. The road is not that dangerous a place in Karachi, but many pedestrians are often injured by careless drivers – especially when the roads are narrow. Those who are squeamish about pollution or have asthma may need to wear a mask; the air pollution from passing trucks and buses, combined with the searing heat and humidity can be overwhelming at times. And don't expect driver will give you way even if you will have right of passage on pedestrian crossings. Crossing the road can be very dangerous too and it is important to stay alert for erratic driving.\n\nIn particular, Saddar area is fairly spread out, but are enjoyable to explore by foot and getting lost in Saddar can make for a thoroughly enjoyable afternoon. It is a chaotic tumble of goods, people, and vehicles and can be navigated quickly on foot and are worth taking some time to wander around.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By rickshaw "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:RickshawPak.jpg"],["thumb"],["A Pakistani auto rickshaw in Karachi"]]},"\nRickshaws are a popular method of travelling in Karachi, they're cheap, flexible and are everywhere in the city at any time of day. If you need to travel shorter distances, go by rickshaw. They're small three-wheeled vehicle powered by a two-stroke or four-stroke engine, partially enclosed contraptions (no doors), run on CNG and can seat three people in the back. You can find them everywhere. Set prices beforehand since most are not equipped with meters and if you're overquoted, don't be afraid to walk away. It's usually easy to find another one soon, usually with a driver who won't rip you off. They don't usually follow traffic guidelines, so some might think it's dangerous, but they're perfectly safe and a cheap way to get around, at-least much cheaper than taxis. Pregnant ladies are most strongly advised not to travel by auto-rickshaws since the combination of rash driving, poor suspensions, and horrible road conditions have quite often led to serious complications. The auto-rickshaw is a slow and uncomfortable vehicle and not recommended for very long distances. The rickshaw drivers are generally helpful and If a rickshaw driver offers to show\/drive you to some great places to shop, firmly refuse.\n\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.callarik.com\/ Call-a-Rik"]}," is an operator of rickshaws which are newest addition to Karachi streets.

Fare start at Rs 10\/ km and charge a minimum of Rs 100 per trip.

Outsiders might be put off by the cramped conditions in the buses, and might prefer travelling in taxis or rickshaw, but the most common method of travelling in Karachi is by bus as they're very cheaper, and less than Rs 50 should be enough to take you from one end of the city to the other. For lack of space, people often sit on the roof, or hang from bars, and are jam-packed inside the bus. They are often operated by reckless drivers who do not follow the rules of the road, endangering many. Women have reserved a separate sitting area in the front of the buses near driver. Apart from the main bus stops, buses are usually hailed from street-level. Buses are seldom marked with destination, instead conductor shout out their destinations. Travellers unfamiliar with Karachi can ask conductor or passengers to let them know where there stop is. Simply politely blurt out the name of your destination to the bus conductor or a friendly looking passenger and they will take care of you. Buses will stop anywhere along the route for you and all have conductors, ask either the conductor of tap on the bus door to signal that you wish to stop.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By taxi "]},"\nThere are plenty of black and white taxis in Karachi. They are convenient, comfortable, and safer than auto rickshaws but cheap by Western standards. If you are alone or going to an unknown destination, this is a good option, even though the rates will be double that of rickshaws. Unlike in most countries, most Black and Yellow taxis in Karachi are not usually marked with \"taxi\" signs on the top, and do not have even meters inside the cab as well, so you should first fix the charge and the location with the driver before getting in. The official rate per kilometre is less than Rs 10 but expect to pay around double. But taxis are cheap and plentiful (Rs 1,000-1,500 should be enough to take you from one end of the city to the other). Most taxis in Karachi are small-medium sized cars (non air-conditioned), run by their own owners, painted black-and-yellow or only black or only yellow. You can hail a cab off the streets. However, please note old modelled taxis are quite rickety and dirty so prefer to get one which looks fine from exterior. The cab drivers are possibly reliable and will take passengers to any destination required. Seat belts are not mandatory for taxi passengers and most standard black and yellow taxis will not even have them installed, though expect them in the branded ones.\n\nIf you have extra pieces of luggage, the boot (i.e. trunk) of the taxi will not provide sufficient space – one large suitcase is all that will fit there. Hiring a taxi with a top carrier will be better. Top carriers can accommodate up to three large suitcases. Before starting the journey, ensure that the luggage is securely fastened to the carrier.\n\nGenerally, the only way to call for the standard taxi is to hail one on the street. This will not be a problem if you are inside city limits but If you are in the suburbs, it will be difficult to find a taxi as they have been out-competed by the cheaper auto-rickshaws. The maximum number of passengers allowed for a trip officially is four — three in the back seat and one in the front.\n\nIf you want a more comfortable and air-conditioned ride, it's best to travel by branded cab services (such as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Karachi Cab"]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/metrocab.com.pk\/ ",{"type":"'''","value":["Metro Radio Cab"]}]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.skycab.pk\/ ",{"type":"'''","value":["Sky Cab"]}]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["White Cab"]}," and many others) that operate with government-approved tariffs so no need to negotiate prices, as they follow fixed rates. These services operate modern fleets with well trained drivers. There are two type of taxi services, regular and call taxis. Regular taxis are normally available at designated taxi stands, at the airport, and at train station  while call taxis can be called anywhere in the city and they're available with 30-60 minutes notice. Mostly cars are white Toyota Corolla, they're clean; air-conditioned; equipped with digital, tamper-proof meters; punctual; honest and GPS-equipped and monitored (which makes them far more secure at any time).

Driving is on the right side and the speed limit is 40 km\/h in residential areas and usually 80 km\/h on arterial roads, but this is only sporadically and capriciously enforced. Driving in Karachi can be a bit difficult and very stressful because of poor driver discipline such as lane discipline is practically non-existent, excessive honking, high vehicle density, lack of regard for traffic law, combined with razor thin passing margins are common, One ride in a taxi will most likely convince you that driving yourself is not worth the risk, so if you do want to arrive by car, you will probably want to hire a car with a driver. which will be better.\n\nMany local and a few international car rental companies (most notably Avis, Europcar, Hertz, and Sixt) operate in the city. Renters will need to provide a valid credit card, a passport or Pakistan national identity card, a cash deposit and their driving licence. But please note most of the car rental is not so popular among visitors and many car rental companies refuse to provide self-drive cars to visitors unless it chauffeur driven.\n\nRenting a self driven cars is expensive as well on the Pakistani standard and cars are mostly compact car with Toyota Corolla most popular and rental cost for a day with fuel can be less than Rs 10,000.

The All Pakistan Music Conference, linked to the 45-year old similar institution in Lahore, has been holding its Annual Music Festival since its inception in 2004. The Festival is now a well-established feature of the city life of Karachi that is eagerly awaited and attended by more than 3,000 citizens of Karachi as well as people from other cities.\n\nThe National Arts Council (Koocha-e-Saqafat) also has musical performances and Mushaira (poetry recitations). Karachi has a few museums including the Mohatta Palace Museum and National Museum of Pakistan that regularly have exhibitions related to performance arts. Karachi is also home to the annual Kara Film Festival, which is one of the biggest film festivals in Pakistan and showcases independent Pakistani and international films and documentaries.\n\nKarachi hosts plenty of cultural events on regular basis, from art exhibitions to concerts, theatre plays and local newspapers often have listings of forthcoming culture event in the city. The city has a fine collection of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Anglo-Indian architecture"]},", a legacy of the British Raj, which will keep history buffs engaged. Culture vultures will find a city with many ",{"type":"'''","value":["art galleries"]},", displaying a broad spectrum of works from Asia, and some New Age works from aspiring Pakistani artists. It is not wrong to mention that some of the most famous art galleries in Pakistan are found here.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Buy "]},"\nKarachi is the shopping capital of the country and Karachiites are avid shoppers and, as such, Karachi boasts an incredible diversity in terms of shopping, accommodating anyone's preferences and budget. Products that shoppers can buy in Karachi come from a vast variety of sources, from one of the many local cottage industries to authentic brand wear by renowned international designers. Whether it is simple trinkets, a nice handicraft or high fashion boutiques that turn you on, Karachi is a shopper's paradise and anything can be found in Karachi if you just ask. A huge range of very affordable products are offered to the point where shopping can overwhelm a visit if you allow it to! Western-style malls and shopping emporiums are popping up across the city but don't expect a traditional or uniquely Pakistani shopping experience in the malls. The city has many modern, high-end shopping malls such as Park Towers, The Forum and Dolmen Mall, in addition to local traditional bazaars and a gamut of streetside vendors. You can ",{"type":"'''","value":["shop"]}," to your heart's content, in the massive range of markets and bazaars that dot the city, or you can shop and enjoy one of the many modern shopping malls that are found across the city's more affluent sectors, namely Defence and Clifton. And don't worry too much about your budget; a recent survey found Karachi to be the cheapest city in the world for expatriates.\n\nThere are a great number of shopping places in Karachi, ranging from the traditional bazaar to the modern shopping malls. A first-time visitor should try and visit the bazaars, The bazaars usually consist of many small vendors selling a variety of products from accessories to clothes to food and drink. In addition, there are larger stores which are more specific in their products. Also one would find that the bazaars are a more culturally enriching experience. One problem is that when shopkeepers find out you're from out of town, they will charge you double\/triple prices. Try to go with someone local if you can to get a good price.\n\nThe shopping experience in the city is a study in contrasts. At the lower end of the spectrum are street vendors. Existing at the borderline of legality, entire streets have been given over to these hawkers and in many places it is impossible to walk on the footpaths, because they have blocked the way. On the other hand, these vendors often give you a great bargain though you will have to haggle a lot and be careful about what to buy. There's nothing like taking a local along to shop for you.\n\nKarachi is probably worth visiting just for its street markets, the hustle of vendors, and the madness of the crowds. Good places are anywhere in Saddar. If you came to Karachi and didn't give visit to this highly dense and crowded area, it means you didn't meet the real Karachi.\nHawkers and street shoppers don't ask for any legal permission and then set their stalls at the places where they see maximum footfall. From electronics items to fresh food, you can get everything anywhere.\n\nMost vendors in Karachi are open to bargaining, which is a common sight at most bazaars and among hawkers. As a result, prices of products vary immensely among every vendor, with the exception of upscale high-end shopping malls, which usually have fixed prices. In Karachi, it is also general knowledge to be cautious when bargaining with vendors, especially in bazaars and with hawkers, as they often sell substandard goods at high prices to unaware shoppers. Apparent foreigners, in particular, are often ripped off.\n\nShopping reaches its peak during the Eid season, as not only established businesses but vendors from all over the country come to the city to sell their goods to the city's large population, a majority of which is middle class and relatively well-off compared to most other parts of the country.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["haggle"],["Haggling"]]}," is very common in most Karachi bazaars – so don't hesitate to negotiate prices. On the whole, shopping in Karachi is an interesting, exhilarating but often tiring experience.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Places to shop "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Karachi - Pakistan-market.jpg"],["thumb"],["Shopping at a Karachi Sunday bazaar"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["buy"],["name=Saddar"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=is the largest shopping district of the city and home to Pakistan's big jewellery market, electronics market, mostly consumer electronics as well everything from A to Z.

Don’t carry too many items like money \/ jewellery \/ watches on you when visit this huge shopping area. Keep it to bare essentials and keep an eye on your belongings.

Several countries started to order their citizens to register with their consulate to receive contact details during extreme situations. Check with your consulate before you travel, if you are required to register, too. \n\nStreet crime in Karachi is about what you'd expect in a huge city. Use common sense and avoid dangerous areas such as slums and suburbs with bad reputation such as Lyari, Orangi town, Malir, New Karachi, and North Karachi where rising gun crime is getting common, however, there should be no serious danger in the affluent parts of the city.

They tend to welcome any foreigner very warmly, but regardless of how nice someone seems you should remain aware and alert at all times.\n\nWomen are usually stared at in certain parts of the city, so they should bring along a male relative or friend, to be safe.  Women should never ever take lifts from strangers and should be careful not to go out alone at night.\n\nIn general, in Karachi, if you are ever worried about your safety, make a loud scene. It is an extremely crowded city, and somebody is always around and willing to help. Keep your money and credit cards safe at all times. Always carry some cash as many places won't take cards.

Avoid any sort of large gatherings, even positive ones, as there's a good chance you'll become the centre of attention and you probably don't want that from a group of raucous chanters.\n\nTry not to drive in Karachi if you are new to the city since drivers are aggressive and undisciplined and traffic is chaotic.
