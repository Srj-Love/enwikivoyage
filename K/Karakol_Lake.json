At an altitude of 3600m (though a height of nearer 3,900 m has been quoted), it is the highest lake of the Pamir plateau, near the junction of the Pamir, Tian Shan and Kunlun mountain ranges. Surrounded by mountains which remain snow-covered throughout the year, the three highest peaks visible from the lake are Muztagh Ata (7546m), Kongur Tagh (7649m) and Kongur Tiube (7530m). The lake is popular among travelers for its unreal scenery and the clarity of its reflection in the water, whose color ranges from a dark green to azure and light blue. There are two Kirgiz settlements along the shore of Karakul lake, a small number of yurts about 1km east of the bus drop-off point and a village with stone houses located on the western shores.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nFall can be quite cold and windy, and a same day return to Kashgar should be considered if you're not well prepared.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nA permit is required for visitors who wish to stay the night. This permit is checked sometimes by the local police in the lake area. This can be very difficult to arrange on your own, but all travel agencies in Kashgar are familiar with the process. However, ignore all agents who tell you that daytrip require a permit.\n\nA daily bus (¥35) heading for Tashkurgan which passes the lake leaves from the long distance bus station in Kashgar at 11.30am Beijing Time (please note that the bus station operates on Xinjiang Time which is -2.00hrs BT; thus the departure time on the ticket is 9.30am). It arrives at the lake after about 4-5 hours. ( April 2011 )\n\nA more reliable means of travelling there is a bus that leaves from TaXian BanShiChu 塔县办事处 (It is best to take a taxi to this is at the edge of Kashgar town). Tickets are ¥51 per person and buses leave at daily 9:30AM daily. It is also possible to hitch a ride with trucks from here. As always, bargain hard!\n\nAnother way to get to Karakul Lake is to book a tour through a travel agency. A reasonable price is ¥200 per person round trip for a day trip with about 2-3 hours at the lake, although such a low price must be bargained hard.  There are tourists who are willing to pay ¥4,000 for a two day trip to the lake, and the travel agencies would like to charge that much if possible.  ¥200 is on the very low side, actually, but is possible depending on the season.\n\nAlternatively, a taxi can be booked from most hotels in Kashgar for a set price of ¥500 per car, per day (i.e. it can be done as a day trip). The plus is that a shared taxi will take about 2-3 hours to get there.\n\nMany people visit the lake either as a stop off when travelling the Karakorum Highway between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pakistan"]]}," and Kashgar, Xinjiang in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\nA permit is now required for all non-PRC citizens traveling on the Karokoram Highway.

Alternatively, there is hotel accommodation in nearby Tashkurgan.\n\nPrices do vary, and the Chinese hotel will try to rip you off. Staying with the Kyrgiz families is a much better experience. They are very honest and hospitable people and the young men who act as travel guides are great hosts. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Lodging"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Camping"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Backcountry"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nGiven the high altitude, rough terrain, and proximity to international borders, one should be careful to not wander too far without previous preparation.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nThe daily bus from Tashkurgan, heading back to Kashgar, arrives at the drop-off point near the Chinese hotel at around 12pm Beijing Time.

Alternatively it may be possible to hitch a ride, although some form of payment will be expected (possibly around ¥50).\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinepark"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Tarim (China)"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Karakul_Lake"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["38.433333333333"],["75.05"]]}]
