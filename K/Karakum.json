The ground beneath the drilling rig collapsed, leaving a large hole with a diameter of more than 70 m (230 ft) and they decided the best solution was to flare the gas. They hoped the fire would use all the fuel in a matter of days, but the gas is still burning today, more than 42 years later!\n\nYou might want to arrive during the daytime, when the crater is impressive but not stunning, and then wait as night falls, when the Door to Hell erupts into a spectacular show. Camping just beyond the pit on the nearby dunes is highly recommended.\n\nThere's two other craters to see, and stopping in some of the desert villages can be fun, but these aren't worth the trek on their own, and virtually every tourist who ventures here comes for the Derweze crater.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:DarvazaMay2011.JPG"],["thumb"],["The Derweze gas crater at night"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nVirtually everyone in the Karakum will speak nothing but Russian and Turkmen, making having a guide through the region all the more essential, particularly if you run into a health or safety issue.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nGetting into the Karakum desert itself isn't particularly difficult–just follow the only highway North out of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ashgabat"]]}," or South out of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Konye Urgench"]]},". However, most people wishing to visit the Karakum intend to visit the gas crater, which involves somewhat more preparation.\n\nTo visit the crater requires driving off-road on the loose sand for significant but not excessive distance. However, as such, ",{"type":"'''","value":["the drive should ",{"type":"''","value":["not"]}," be undertaken by those without off-road experience"]},", and doing so in a rental car (if you can get one) will almost certainly violate your contract.
