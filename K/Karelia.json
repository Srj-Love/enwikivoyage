The second-largest lake of Europe, Lake Onega, is located in Karelia. The largest lake of Europe, Lake Ladoga is partly located in Karelia (together with Leningrad Oblast). Wherever there is land, there are dense forests covering the ground.\n\nKarelia has strong cultural connection with Finland and the Karelians, after whom the republic is named, are a Finno-Ugric group very closely related to the Finns. Karelia is a relatively recent Russian\/Soviet conquest from Finland, and a bit of a sore spot for the Finns.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nEverybody understands and speaks ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russian phrasebook"],["Russian"]]},", although many are bilingual in Karelian, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Finnish phrasebook"],["Finnish"]]},", and, on smaller scale, Veps. A traveler could get by with only knowledge of Finnish, as many native ethnic Russians understand a good deal of the language.\n\nBasic English is widely understood by young people. Swedish is relatively popular foreign language too.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nAs of February 2014, there only flights to Karelia from outside are from Moscow(Domodedovo) 5 times a week and from Saint-Petersburg 2 times a week to Petrozavodsk(Besovetc). The timetable changes often though (every 2-3 months lately).\n\nThere are several trains to Petrozavodsk from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saint Petersburg"]]}," (7 hours; both overnight and day-time) and from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]}," (16 hours, overnight). Trains, that go through main Karelian transport corridor: Svir' - Petrozavodsk - ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Medvegjyegorsk"]]}," - ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Belomorsk"]]},", are almost always bound to Petrozavodsk or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Murmansk"]]},". Most popular, long-known and comfortable trains are 15\/16 Moscow - Saint-Petersburg - Murmansk \"Arktika\", 17\/18 Moscow - Petrozavodsk \"Kareliya\" (bypassing Saint-Petersburg), 5\/6 Saint-Petersburg - Petrozavodsk (evening trains that runs 5 hours to Petrozavodsk without stops), 657\/658 Saint-Petersburg - Petrozavodsk (overnight), 21\/22 Saint-Petersburg - Murmansk (arriving to Petrozavodsk from Saint-Petersburg just after midnight and leaving back very early in the morning). There are several more trains from both capitals, some often seasonal or extra services. Seasonal and extra services trains, as usual, are more close to traditional Russian less comfortable style.\n\nOther trains to Kareliya run only several times a week and ofter are seasonal, or going on and off. As of January 2014, following routes are operational: Minsk - Murmansk (pass Petrozavodsk south Tu,Sa, north Tu,Th). Saint-Petersburg - Sortavala - Kostomuksha (leaves Saint-Petersburg We,Fr, arrives to Saint-Petersburg Th,Su), Murmansk - Vologda (starts from Murmansk Fr,Su, from Vologda We,Fr). \n\nPetrozavodsk is connected by buses with Joensuu(Finland) (from Joensuu bus leaves at 16:00 Th-Su, from Petrozavodsk at 6:00 Th-Su, transfer tickets to Finland buses are available), Saint-Petersburg (4-5 times a day), Cherepovets through Tikhvin (from Cherepovets at 7:30 on Fr), Vologda through Voznesenje ferry (from Vologda at 8:10 Mo,Sa), daily from Vytegra through Pudog, and on Tu,Fr,Sa from Vytegra through Voznesenje. There are also buses from Saint-Petersburg to Pudog, Pitkyaranta and Sortavala. Complete (and subject to change) timetables are on ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/avokzal.karelia.ru\/avtovokzal\/regular\/interurban.html ",{"type":"'''","value":["Petrozavodsk bus station"]}," site"]},".\n\nBy car there are 2 main routes to Kareliya: through M-18 from Saint-Petersburg (from Moscow you can get to M-18 bypassing Saint-Petersburg through A114 Zuevo - Volkhov - Novaya Ladoga), and by M-8 and R-5 from Moscow via Vologda. An alternate route is via R-37 Lodeinoe Pole - Vytegra and then on to R-5 (this route is informally called ",{"type":"''","value":["Arhangelsk trakt"]},"), but this route contains enough unpaved stretches. If you will choose any route except M-18, do note that most Karelian roads are in bad state, rather bumpy (this includes Karelian part of R-5, though not Vologda region part), and often include unpaved stretches .\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nMost public transport in Karelia runs along part of bus and train routes from Saint-Petersburg to Murmansk: on M18 from Olonets, and by rail from station Svir' near Podporogye further north through Petrozavodsk, Kondopoga, Medveg'yegorsk, Segezha, Belomorsk and Kem'. M18 runs to the west of most of those towns, with distance of 3 to 20km from them.\n\nOther relatively popular bus routes are to Sortavala (through Olonets, or via more direct route through A121), Suoyarvi and Spasskaya Guba. There are quite a number of suburb buses, starting from Petrozavodsk.\n\nApart from these routes transport (including buses to Kostomuksha and Pudozh among others) is quite scarce, and number of local buses is small. \n\nTo get to Valaam you'll have to get on public or private boat from Sortavala. To get to Kizhi in navigation period, you can get on boat or hydrofoil from Petrozavodsk or Velikaya Guba village. In winter there may be occasional connection to Kizhi via cushioncraft or helicopter from airport \"Peski\" in Petrozavodsk. Sometimes there may be a helicopter to Pudozh, or in summer a boat to the opposite shore of Onega not far from Pudozh.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Ruskeala1.JPG"],["thumb"],["350 px"],["An abandoned Finnish dam at a waterfall near Ruskeala, Karelia"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Valamo Monastery"]}," - the monastery of the Finnish Orthodox Church. Originally Valamo was placed on an island of lake Ladoga in Karelia but was evacuated whilst in war with the Russians in the 1940s.

The monastery is visited by many Finns, orthodox or not, and is featured in most tourist guides as well. Pilgrims come to see the ancient icons from the old Valamo monastery.

It's also possible to travel here by helicopter from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Petrozavodsk"]]},". The trip by boat from Sortavala costs 750 rubles one way. The journey takes 40 minutes. A boat leaves at 9.00 am. You get an excursion for 1500 rubles (boat leaves at 9.30 am), which includes visits to other sketes. There is a marshrutka on Valaam, which charges 70 rubles for the 6 km between the Monastirskaja landing and Nikolovskaja landing. Walks on Valaam, visiting the sketes and crossing the bridges to some islets are pleasant. There is a small fjord north of the Nikolovskaja landing.
