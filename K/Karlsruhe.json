It is located in the north of the Black Forest, close to the French border. Karlsruhe is famous in Germany for both hosting two federal courts and being a major hub for science and technology. Populated by about 300,000 people, Karlsruhe is the largest city within 60 km. And it is not usually visited for touristic reasons by anyone coming from farther away while being a relaxed and pleasant city to work and study in.\n\nCurrently the city centre is plagued by considerable construction sites for a tram subway (\"Kombilösung\") that is to be completed in 2017.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nThe city was founded in 1715 by margrave Karl Wilhelm von Baden. The city was laid out on the drawing board. It consists of a central circle, containing the castle, and streets running towards the castle as radial \"spokes\". This pattern is still visible today. Due to the fan-like layout, Karlsruhe is known as the \"fan city\" (Fächerstadt).\n\nThe Rhine valley, where Karlsruhe is located, is the warmest part of Germany because it is only about 115 m above sea level and there are mountains in the east (black forest) and west (vogesen). Therefore, Karlsruhe has more sunny days than many other parts of Germany.\n\nThere isn't a lot of tourist traffic to Karlsruhe. Tourists generally tend to gravitate towards the cities of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Heidelberg"]]}," (50 km to the north) and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Freiburg"]]}," (100 km to the south), with their well-preserved old towns.  It's a shame though, as Karlsruhe's radial layout is one of the best early examples of New Urbanism, and is really a joy to explore.  Maybe that's a benefit to travelers who do venture there as the number of visitors is low enough to be sort of a novelty for the locals.\n\nKarlsruhe is home to the two highest federal courts of Germany, the ",{"type":"''","value":["Bundesverfassungsgericht"]}," (Federal constitutional court) and the ",{"type":"''","value":["Bundesgerichtshof"]}," (Supreme federal court). Because of this and other administrative facilities, Karlsruhe has a reputation as a city of civil servants.\n\nKarlsruhe has a large and renowned technical university (KIT) as well as several other colleges.  The presence of the technical university has promoted the city somewhat in the world of Free and Open Source Software: Karlsruhe was the home of LinuxTag ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/linuxtag.org"]}," until 2005.
