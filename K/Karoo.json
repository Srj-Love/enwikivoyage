The Karoo’s clear night sky is densely studded with countless stars and huge, bright planets; even other galaxies are visible with the naked eye, offering some of the best star- gazing in the world. Fossils of some of the earliest forms of one-celled life have been discovered in the Karoo, indicating that life has existed in this region for more than three billion years. The richness of predinosaur fossils in this region is world-renowned. To experience the magic of this area, you must venture off the N1 national road where you will discover eccentric little hamlets, sprawling farmsteads and historical towns populated by warm and welcoming people that love to share their stories and legends.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Tourism information offices"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.aberdeenec.com Aberdeen Publicity & Tourism Office"]}]},", +27 (0)49 846-0067  "]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.somerseteasttousism.co.za Blue Crane Route Tourism Office"]}]},", +27 (0)42 243-6448 , bcrm.tourism@lgnet.org.za.
