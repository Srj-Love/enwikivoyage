Especially mopeds are frequently used by local youths and can go to many places that cars cannot go - for example the twisted narrow streets of karpathos city. An additional advantage is that they are cheap to rent - 10 to 15 Euros a day is the usual price.\n\nIf you start a day-trip with a moped, make you sure you do so on a full tank, as gas stations are sometimes hard to find. An extra stop at a gas station can save a lot of nerves. When renting a moped, check if the profile of the tyres is ok and if the brakes work properly. If it is the last vehicle in store, be suspicious - it could be the one that needs a repair badly. Though helmets are not required on the streets, it might be a good idea to ask your rent-a-bike for one, especially if you intend to drive on streets with more traffic.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["The villages: Avlona, Menetes, Olymbos, Aperi and Pyles.
