Significant and picturesque, the fort is now a popular tourist destination located by the Kali river bridge, which has been built at the confluence of the river and the Arabian Sea. Konkani is spoken as a local language. \nThe fort was built on an old fortified site on the north bank of Kali River where it meets the sea. It had about 8 meters high ramparts which were about 2 metres wide at the top. There were towers and openings for guns. The citadel was at the highest point. An outwork was on the west, near the sea at the base of the cliff and was appropriately called Pani Killa. There was another outwork on the eastern slope. The citadel had single arched gateway.\nSamvargad was a very small fort, about 60 metres by 20 metres on top of a hillock east of Sadashivgad. It was a satellite fort guarding the former on its east & north east. Very few ruins remain.\nThe fort was named Sadashivgad by Basavlingraj after his father Sadashivlingraj in 1715. They were chieftains of Sonda who assumed the title of 'Raja' after incorporating Chittakula, Simveshwar (Angadi), Kadra, Kadwad, Ankola and some other parts of Canara. The old Karwar fort was pulled down and its material used to build Sadashivgad.\nThe fort is in ruins as most of it was pulled down by East India Company General Matthews in 1783. A road now runs between it and its satellite fort Samvargad.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Arabian sea from Sadashivgarh fort.JPG"],["thumb"],["Panoramic view of Arabian sea from  Sadashivgarh fort, Karwar"]]},"\n\nMidway on the Sadashivagad hill is the many centuries old Shantadurga Temple, known for its serenity. From the peak of the hill, the view of the sun setting in the Arabian sea, is an experience in itself. The 17th century Dargah also attracts a lot of Muslim pilgrims.\nAt a distance of approximately 2 km northwards a village lies by name Shiveshvar which got Fortress Kot Shiveshvar (mentioned in the Mangalore treaty between Tipu Sultan and the East India Company, as well as in earlier historical accounts) built exclusively for guarding the northern borders of Canara. It was built by the Bijapur Sultanate and subsequently, its fortunes were connected to the Sadashivgad Fort. This fort is in a shambles but the eastern gate, a Muslim graveyard, well and tunnel can still be seen.\nAnother important village is Kadwad situated on the banks of tributary of the Kali River, from which the name 'Karwar' has been derived. At this location the British used to have a factory and it was an important trade port in earlier days. It also had a large Muslim population and a larger mosque which was frequented by traders from Arabia and Africa.\nThe National Highway NH-17 continues on a bridge built over Kali River and the road splits the Sadashivgad granite hill to connect Karnataka to Goa.\nSadashivgad used to be a popular word for native konkani speaking people travelling from Mumbai to Karwar before the advent of Konkan Railway. Maharashtra State Transport Corporation buses plying on this route carried the Bus Route Name as Bombay Central - Sadashivgad.\nJayshree Gadkar a noted Marathi movie actress and a star of Marathi cinema in the 1960s was born in a Marathi speaking family at Kanasgiri village very close to Sadashivgad.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nBeaches, Islands and mangrove up on the Kali river\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Heading_for_a_new_journey_at_Tagore_Beach.JPG"],["thumb"],["Tagore Beach"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=abrar karwar"],["alt=abrar"],["url=http:\/\/abrarkarwar.net"],["email="],["address=abrar a shaikh sadashivgad karwar"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=karwar info"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=this is a karwar web site provided for karwar people and other to karwar info"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nBeautiful beaches, snorkling, banana boating\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["buy"],["name="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=there are small pan stalls, chat stalls, etc."]]}]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nSea Food and some local restaurants, \"Gadbad\" Icecream.\n\nSome of the famous local restaurants include:\n\nPooornima Restaurant, Main Road, Karwar.
