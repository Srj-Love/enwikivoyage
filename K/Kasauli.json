The place where the lord actually kept his feet is believed to be at a hillock which is 300 m high.\n\nHistorically, Kasauli is one of those hill stations that was developed by the British Empire during its peak period in India.

Still, you will be accompanied on your walk by the sweet and soothing voices of the birds along with the gentle rustling of leaves.\n\nFor those who are quite the opposite and look for fun and adventure at every step, Kasauli will be a disappointment as there is hardly anything to do.

The remaining staff is comprised of civilians. The history of this club dates back to the British era when, Kasauli was founded as an accessible summer retreat. Typical of hill architecture, the club was constructed mostly of seasoned wood. Some years ago, tragedy stuck when a malfunctioning electric component started a fire which razed the club. A new and much-improved wood structure has since replaced the old one. The interior finish and decor are lavish. Facilities include lodging (4–5 rooms), a squash court that has been redone recently, two tennis courts, bridge\/card rooms, billiards, and an outdoor garden.

Unlike Kasauli, Jagjit Nagar is much more serene and has dense forests. Accessiblity from Chandigarh, improvement in local infrastructure, proximity to Kasauli, and friendly locals are some of the reasons why real estate is booming here.

In 2006, Jagjit Nagar was brought under the jurisdiction of the local Town and Country Planning Authority (TC). As of 2007, to prevent degradation of its surroundings by construction-related activities, the local government has disallowed any construction above 2 500 000 rupees.
