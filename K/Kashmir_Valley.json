Torn by war, terrorism and violence since 1948, this beautiful valley has long been considered a dangerous place to go to, but tourism is slowly coming back to the valley as militancy, which began in the early 90s (as a means of protest against what some describe as forceful Indian occupation) has come down.\nThe most famous places to visit in Kashmir are ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Srinagar"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pahalgam"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gulmarg"]]},".

Although work on the garden started a couple of years back, nevertheless, with each season it is expanding rapidly and is fast becoming a major tourist attraction in Spring.\nAngling in the many fresh water streams is an attraction in spring as well or if you missed out on Skiing in winter, you could go skiing in Gulmarg which offers excellent opportunities till late March.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Summer"]}," brings a lot of tourists to the valley, especially those from the Indian plains which experience unbearably hot temperatures during the summers.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Gulmarg"]}," being a perennial favourite can be visited. Gulmarg means 'the meadow of flowers' and is located 56 kilometers south-west of the city centre, Srinagar. The slopes of the Apharwat hills (of the Himalayas) at Gulmarg are one of the highest ski slopes in Asia. Due to its' unique geographical location, Gulmarg gets some of the heaviest snowfall in the Himalayan region.

Sonamarg literally means \"Meadow Of Gold\".\nThe skiing season in Gulmarg, the world famous ski resort in Kashmir, lasts for about four months, but with the Thajiwas Glacier and the upper reaches of the Sonamarg valley covered with snow practically all through the year, skiers can thrill themselves for a longer period.\nSonamarg has a certain \"raw\" unspoiled beauty about it.

",{"type":"''","value":["Shahtoos"]}," or Ringshawl as it was known was exclusively made by hand in Kashmir and was worn by celebrities and high profile dignitaries. This shawl is so soft that it can pass through a ring! However, it has been banned by the Government after animal rights campaigners objected because it involves killing a baby antelope in the high regions of Ladakh and making the shawl from its hide. \n\nAlthough the Shahtoos shawl has been rightly banned it shouldn't stop you from buying the famed Kashmiri Pashmina. \n\nPashmina is exclusively Kashmiri and a good quality Pashmina shawl (including one that is hand embroidered by Kashmiri artisans) can cost upwards of $ 450.\n\nThe intricacies of hand made Kashmiri carpets are well known. Most take months, some even a couple of years to make. The history of the Kashmiri carpet dates back to the period of Hazrat Mir Syed Ali  Hamdani (1341-1385 A.D) - the famous sufi saint of Persia who came to enlighten Kashmir with his spiritual guidance and brought along with him highly skilled artisans through the silk trade route.\n\nKashmir witnessed a phenomenal rise and growth in all things artistic in the golden reign of Sultan Zain ul Abideen ,popularly known as Budshah (Great King ) in the 15th century. Emperor Akbar in the 16th Century is said to have encouraged the art of carpet weaving by bringing in more skilled artisans to the Kashmir valley.\n\nAn original Kashmir carpet can be very expensive but the right one can be as prized or treasured as any work of art.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nRich and redolent with the flavour of cinnamon, cardamom, cloves and saffron, Kashmiri food is suitable for all palates.

It's a preparation of a number of spicy meat dishes served with traditional rice by professional chefs called \"Wazas\".Kashmiri wazwaan has its origin in Persia and is almost always served in Kashmiri marriage parties. It also has some interesting vegetarian options like dum-aloo , haak ,palak and 'chaman' (cooked cheese). Among the popular non-vegetarian delicacies are curd based Gushtaba, chilli-flavoured Rista and Roganjosh.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nKashmiris celebrate the first snowfall of the season by socialising over a barbecue.

If you plan to travel in the Kashmir Valley, it is important that you get yourself registered with the Foreignersâ€™ Registration unit of the Tourism Department. The registration counters are at Tourist Reception centers at Srinagar Airport, Srinagar City, Gulmarg, Sonmarg, Phalgam and some other places. At Srinagar Airport there is a very kind lady tourist officer who can give you some helpful and safe tour advice.\n\nIn case of an emergency you can contact the nearest tourist police office or police station. The ",{"type":"'''","value":["emergency number"]}," of the Police Control Room is ",{"type":"'''","value":["100"]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Personal safety"]},"\nKashmiris are considered very hospitable people. The Amarnath Yatra in which Hindus annually visit a cave situated deep in high altitude mountains in Pahalgam (supposedly the abode of Lord Shiva) has been going on peacefully for more than a hundred years and Kashmiris have been known to provide all help to the yatris, sometimes even braving harsh mountain weather (which is not that rare considering it's a high altitude pilgrimage.) \n\nThat said, Kashmir is an area of conflict, and the danger of being killed or kidnapped by combatants, though lower than in some years past, is not to be taken lightly. During the peak of militancy in 1995, a Norwegian tourist, Hans Christian OstrÃ¸, and five other western tourists were kidnapped by a hitherto unknown terrorist group, Alfaran. John Childs, an American, managed to escape. However OstrÃ¸ was tragically beheaded.  The other tourists have never been found since and are presumed dead. Mainstream separatists denounced this act and terrorist organisations based in Pakistan denied any hand in the executions. In 2006 a campaign of grenade attacks in Srinagar claimed the lives of six tourists and wounded forty on July 11. The targets included a tourist bus and the Tourist Reception Centre. A similar attack on May 31 against a tourist bus wounded 21. An explosion in a tourist bus in Shalimar Gardens on July 29th, 2007 claimed six lives and wounded 21. In the summer of 2008 a controversy arose in which Kashmiris resisted the transfer of land to the Amarnath Shrine Board created by the Government of India, fearing dilution of the Muslim majority demography of the state. During this time a grenade attack in Gulmarg killed one tourist and injured five. \n\nViolence is down considerably so far in 2013, but there is always a potential of renewed conflict between the armies of India and Pakistan across the Line of Control, a renewed upsurge of conflict between Kashmiri separatists and Indian security forces, terrorist attacks on civilians, or violent demonstrations. So check for current conditions before you go.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["34.5000"],["76.0000"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Jammu and Kashmir"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Kashmir"]]}]
