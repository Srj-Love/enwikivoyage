While this may seem to be the easiest way, it is often not. For even modestly long journeys, it may be difficult to carry the requisite amount of food. It is often impractical to refrigerate perishables (although food can be kept frozen in an airplane, as long as the plane is not delayed on the ground for too long), and while non-perishable food items will travel more easily, you will need extra space to pack them.

You will need to contact the synagogue or outreach center directly to find out about what is available, how to purchase, and how to obtain the food. This can be especially helpful in cities or countries where a Jewish community presence is limited. If visiting around a major Jewish holiday or on the Sabbath, you may also be able to partake in a full meal at the synagogue or outreach center, usually at no charge (though a donation to the center may be requested).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["By country"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Israel"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Israel"]]}," is one of the most welcoming countries in the world for kosher travelers.
