The centrepiece is a huge underground tank with dozens of pillars. It has been called the \"temple\", and serves as a setting for TV commercials. A 90-minute group tour is offered each Tuesday-Friday, at 10AM, 1PM, and 3PM. It is free, but you must reserve (in Japanese) by phone or over the internet 1-28 days in advance. The tour is in Japanese, and someone in each party must be able to translate safety instructions for non-speakers. About 10 minutes of the tour is actually spent in the \"temple\".
