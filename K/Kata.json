Kata retains a village feel at its northern and southern ends and is perhaps more family-oriented, its one-kilometre long beach more peaceful than Patong.\n\nThe main road runs from Kata at the end near Karon Beach all the way to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kata Noi Beach"]]},". In Kata centre you can find many shops that sell tourist gifts. These shops can be grouped into gift, tailor, music, and massage. Restaurants are well-priced and food is good.  Bars start further on down the road towards Kata Beach. \n\nKata Beach has safe swimming and does not have any drop offs.  It is safe for children and non-swimmers. Always take notice of the flags that fly, they will let you know if it is not safe to swim. There is a coral reef on the right hand side of the beach that goes out to Ko Pu (Crab Island). Sitting on the beach and looking right you may see local fishermen on the rocks trying to catch their supper.\n\nOne kilometre south of Kata Yai is Kata Noi, a smaller beach with fewer hotels and less development. The beach is superb. Many fish inhabit the rocks and corals along the shoreline stretching south.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["From the airport, you can take a minibus to Kata Beach for about 180 baht.

At one end of the market near the main road to Chalong you might just see an old man shelling coconuts with a very old, and dangerous looking machine.\n\nTry to find the sauna in the jungle. It has an old copper water boiler that looks like a kettle, there is a cafe there and a plunge pool. They put tree bark in the water to make the steam smell like menthol. The sauna can be found on the right, about 10 min walk at the south end of Kata along the road that takes you to Chalong Bay.\n\nThere is a small shopping area called KT Plaza (next to Black Canyon Coffee); selling souvenirs and apparel.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Diving and Snorkelling"]}," There is a great shallow snorkelling and diving location on the north side of the bay.
