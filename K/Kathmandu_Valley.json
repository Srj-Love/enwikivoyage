In the larger centers such as Kathmandu, there is increasing interest in western cuisine. As a consequence, the traveller can find nearly any kind of food while wandering around Nepal. Dishes are more traditional in smaller communities.\n\nIn places like Kathmandu, it is possible to find almost anything your taste buds crave. One exception would seem to be the large, North American fast-food chains which don't seem to have arrived in Nepal yet. \n\nBeef dishes are almost non-existent in Nepal, given proscriptions against killing cows. Meat dishes tend to use chicken, pork, mutton or water buffalo (yak at higher elevations).\n\nOne traditional dish is thukpa. Look for it in your travels.\n\nNepalis eat many vegetarian dishes (not necessarily vegan....). The most common examples would be dal bhat, pulao (a fried rice dish) and a variety of potato dishes.\n\nMost meals tend to be rather bland but the Nepalese make use of green chili sauce, a variety of pickles and curries.\n\nA popular snack is a kind of dumpling called momos, prepared either steamed or fried, and filled with either chicken, water buffalo meat (referred to as \"buff\") or vegetables.\n\nThere are a few points of etiquette that the visitor should be aware of.  Since the left hand is considered \"unclean\", pass food with the right, eat with the right hand, avoid touching other people's food and stay out of the kitchen, especially if you are a non-Hindu in a Hindu home.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nEven in the most crowded parts of Kathmandu, crime is infrequent. Take the normal precautions and avoid flashing money around and keep your valuables secure as you would anywhere. Generally, even though foreigners are rather obvious, you will be left alone, other than the frequent approaches by tiger balm salesmen, taxi drivers, rickshaw drivers and other independent entrepreneurs.\n\nYour health does depend on being careful about drinking water. As a general rule, don't drink any water that hasn't been either treated (filtered or UV sterilized) or boiled.\n\nBe careful about eating food from street vendors. It's always a bit of a chance as to whether such food will upset your digestive system. Established restaurants can generally be considered safe. Vegetables and salad greens can be a problem because they may have been washed with unsafe water. Some restaurants make a point of mentioning that they wash salad greens with lightly iodized water. Anything cooked at a high temperature should be safe. Keep in mind that western digestive systems will not be accustomed to the eastern micro-flora and problems can be expected, especially if you are not careful.\n\nAlthough antibiotics are readily available without prescription in Nepal, you might be advised to bring something specifically recommended by your doctor to combat severe digestive upset. Have a discussion with your doctor and get advice on how to deal with such problems.\n\nElevations in the Kathmandu Valley are low so there will be no concerns with any of the risks of higher altitudes. If you do \"head for the hills\", make sure you read about mountain sickness and how to avoid problems.\n\nRabies is endemic in the dog population but you should have few problems if you leave the animals alone. Generally, unless you are in an area for awhile and are actively working with animals, you probably do not need a rabies vaccine.  \n\nA series of vaccinations for two strains of Hepatitis is recommended before you leave home.\n\nYou should not have to be concerned about ",{"type":"[[","value":[["malaria"]]}," unless you go to the more southern parts of Nepal, closer to the Indian border.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pokhara"]]}," - Popular lakeside tourist town 200km west of Kathmandu.
