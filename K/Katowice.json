In the 18th century numerous work colonies sprang up here and around 1769-70 the Duke of Pless established an underground coal mine. The next industrial sites were the Hohenlohe steelworks in the village of Wełnowiec, founded in 1805, the Baildon steelworks in 1828  (named after their founder, a Scotsman), and the Wilhelmina zinc works in 1834.\n\nIn 1873 Katowice achieved the status of county town. In 1897 Katowice was formed into a separate urban district, which also included the suburban municipalities of Bogucice - Zawodzie, Dąb, Wełnowiec and Załęże.\n\nIn 1889 one of the largest companies in Upper Silesia, the Kattowitzer Aktien-Gesellschaft, was set up with its headquarters in Katowice. As a result, major insurance companies and large-cap banks were attracted to the city. During the First World War, the steel industry continued to develop at a frenetic pace. Rail connections were also developed.\n\nAfter Third Silesian Uprising Polish Government had decided to give Silesia considerable Autonomy with Katowice as a capital and home of the Silesian Parliament. It was the time of city most intense growth (1922-1939).\n\nIn 1975 the neighbouring municipalities of ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.piotrowice.katowice.pl Piotrowice"]},", Ochojec, Panewniki, ",{"type":"''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/kostuchna.boo.pl Kostuchna"]}]},", Wełnowiec, Szopienice, Giszowiec, Dąbrówka Mała and Murcki were merged with Katowice. Construction works were still continuing in the city centre. The main communications artery (al. W. Korfantego) was widened, old industrial buildings to the west of this road were demolished. To the east the historic Tiele-Winckler Palace was also demolished. On the market place, old buildings were replaced by modern shops: \"Zenit\" and \"Skarbek\", and also the \"Dom Prasy\".\n\nThe construction of the Roundabout and the \"Flying Saucer\" (",{"type":"''","value":["Spodek"]},") Sports Hall (1962–71) had a significant impact. The Millennium Housing Estate on the border of Katowice and Chorzów, the Paderewski Estate to the east of the city, the Południe Estate covering the suburbs of Kostuchna, Piotrowice, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ligota.info Ligota"]},", and the Roździeński Housing Estate should also be mentioned.\n\nIn first decades of 21st century Katowice is going through another development phase.
