The region attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors each year, mostly during the Spring to Autumn months, who come to cottages and resorts in the area, or to some of the many hotels, motels, inns and excellent campgrounds.  There is year round activity, though, including fishing, hunting, hiking, camping, golf, festivals, museums, cultural and historic attractions, shopping and more.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Regions"]},"\nTownship of North Kawartha\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Peterborough (Ontario)"],["Peterborough"]]}," - the region's major business, education, cultural, and health care centre"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kawartha Lakes"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bobcaygeon"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Apsley"]]}," - cottage community & popular seasonal vacation destination"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe city of Peterborough is reachable by Greyhound intercity bus services from Toronto (8 times a day) and Ottawa (approx. 2X a day).

No photos are allowed however the experience is breathtaking.  The art work and mindset of the original inhabitants of the landscape is recorded in stone and one cannot help but wonder and understand what lay in the minds of these first peoples.  An absolute wonder and possibly the greatest cultural site in Ontario.  Hiking trails and some lakes are also in the park as well as plentiful wildlife.
