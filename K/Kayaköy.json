According to that treaty, all Greek Orthodox inhabitants of Turkey were to be exiled to Greece, while all Muslim inhabitants of Greece were to be exiled to Turkey in return. When the Greek inhabitants of Kayaköy left for Greece, Muslims from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Macedonia (Greece)"],["Greek Macedonia"]]}," were settled in their place. However, the Macedonians who were used to large and fertile fields in their former land found this hilly and rocky area with little arable land unfit to live, and abandoned the place in favour of other regions. Decades of neglect in addition to the big earthquake of 1957 that shook the region hard has left Kayaköy what it is today.\n\nIn its heyday, Kayaköy was populated enough to support a local newspaper and several schools and stores, but today there is only a handful of natives living there, mostly in the neighbourhoods of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Keçiler"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Kınalı"]},", about 2 km north and 2 km west of the \"ghost town\" of Kayaköy respectively.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fethiye"]]}," is the major hub of the region, and as such, is the point of entry for most, if not all, travellers to Kayaköy.

There is also a hiking path which somewhat shortcuts the gravel road. The trail begins out of Kınalı, at where the road starts windings and descents towards the coast. Just off shore of Gemile is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["St Nicholas Island"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["Gemiler Adası"]}," in Turkish) with some ruins of a Byzantine chapel which dates back to 5th century.\n\nPerhaps a more rewarding sight in the same direction is the monastery at ",{"type":"'''","value":["Afkule"]}," (also spelled ",{"type":"'''","value":["Af Kule"]},"), clinging at the high cliffs over the sea, and which affords really impressive views over the Gulf of Fethiye, as far away as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rhodes"]]}," if the air is clear. Other than its roof, this Greek Orthodox monastery is as sound as it was when abandoned in 1920s. To get there, you will need a short (about 3 km) but pretty demanding hike up and down along a trail, part of it, though, fortunately, through a pine forest. In total it takes around an hour on foot to get there from the ghost town. West of Kayaköy, leave the gravel road to Gemile at where the trail (a dirt track) to Afkule branches off, which is properly marked by yellow signs. At about midway through the trail to Afkule (about 1 km away from where you started), you'll notice a branching track to right—this is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["wrong"]}," path, keep to the trail to left instead. The trail ends in an open space—carpark for those taking their vehicles along the track. From here, take the wide track to right, which is waymarked with the yellow&red marks usual in the area, and which will slowly ascent to the top of the cliff, which is about 1 km away from the carpark. Then the trail will descend down to the monastery, but be extremely careful in this section as it is very easy to slip down since the path is covered with loose gravel. Perhaps not for the fainthearted, you can further explore the lower stories of the complex (the church and residences of the monks) once you are in the monastery, though that will require a very steep climb down with the full view of high cliffs down to the coast (a whopping 400 mt just below your feet), so those with afraid of heights—do beware.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Horseback riding"]}," is a popular activity in Kayaköy."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Kayaköy Art Camp"],["alt=Kayaköy Sanat Kampı"],["url=http:\/\/www.sanatkampi.com\/"],["email=kayakoy@sanatkampi.com"],["address=Kayaköy"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+90-533-763-62-73 (mobile)"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=€320\/two weeks (if you bring your own tent), €390\/two weeks (guesthouse rooms shared by two–three persons)"],["content=Offers two-week workshops on photography, pottery, painting, traditional carpet weaving, woodwork and the like in the ghost town setting; with the afternoons set aside for trips to nearby sites.

While it is not much more than a cove with a quite short of stretch of pebble beach really, it is the nearest access to the sea from Kayaköy. The restaurant with wild boar stew on the menu just behind the beach may also worth the trip there.\n\nThe waymarks on this route are red dots. There are no signs but the dots are placed once every few metres, so it's upsettingly impossible to get lost.\n\nThe route starts from in front of the lower church and ascents towards the hilltop. To avoid the fee of 8 TL to access the area around the church, either start very early before the office opens, or take a long detour around the part of the town that was declared museum (you can start by taking the path on the side of the old fountain). Take the small chapel on the very top hill as a bearing — you should be walking towards (but not straight to) it. Once you are clear off the house ruins, near the hilltop, there are two trails: One leading to the chapel, other descending towards the (now visible) sea. Both trails are signed with the same red dots so be careful. At this point, the trail begins descending on volcanic-looking somewhat slippery surface between again volcanic-looking huge brown rocks. After passing a short level ground with some shrubs here and there, it again starts descending towards the sea, which the trail soon meets.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" There is only one ",{"type":"'''","value":["grocery store"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["market"]},") in Kayaköy, on the side of the road past the church, and they don't accept credit cards.
