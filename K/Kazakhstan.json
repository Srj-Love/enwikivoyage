The area was conquered by Russia in the 18th century, and Kazakhstan became a Soviet Republic in 1936.\n\nDuring the launching of the 1950s and 1960s agricultural \"Virgin Lands\" program, Soviet citizens were encouraged to help cultivate Kazakhstan's northern pastures. This influx of immigrants (mostly Russians, but also some other deported nationalities, including the Volga Germans) skewed the ethnic mixture and enabled non-Kazakhs to outnumber natives. Independence has caused many of these newcomers to emigrate.\n\nModern Kazakhstan is a neo-patrimonial state characterized by considerable nepotism and dominance over political and economic affairs by President Nursultan Nazarbayev. However, it is not a severely authoritarian government as compared to bordering Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and China and opposition is not usually sacked or imprisoned. Since independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, the Kazakh government has allowed foreign investment to flow into the capital to develop. The development of significant oil and gas reserves, particularly in the north and west, have subsequently brought a large amount of wealth to the country, though the money falls into the hands of just a few people. Nevertheless, Kazakhstan is now labelled a middle-income country, and is already classified with a high human development index. Corruption in Kazakhstan is ubiquitous compared to China, but it is not as widespread compared to other countries in the region.\n\nCurrent issues include: Developing a cohesive national identity; expanding the development of the country's vast energy resources and exporting them to world markets (an oil pipeline to China has been built; the gas pipeline is under construction); achieving a sustainable economic growth outside the oil, gas, and mining sectors, and strengthening relations with surrounding states and other foreign powers.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Regions"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Regionlist"],["regionmap=Kazakhstan regions map.png"],["regionmapsize=500px"],["region1name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Almaty Province"]]}],["region1color=#a7c8ad"],["region1description=the ex-capital, treks into Tian Shan, historic towns, ancient petroglyphs"],["region2name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kazakhstani North"]]}],["region2color=#d6b9e4"],["region2description=cold steppes home to the national capital, the country's Russian minority, and industrial cities"],["region3name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kazakh Desert"]]}],["region3color=#e7c9a8"],["region3description=ancient desert cities dotting the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Silk Road"]]}],["region4name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Altai (Kazakhstan)"],["Altai"]]}],["region4color=#a5bad4"],["region4description=remote and beautiful alpine scenery"],["region5name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Caspian Basin"]]}],["region5color=#dbaeb3"],["region5description=Caspian beaches and oil industry, and where local tribal affiliations still run strong"],["region6name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Central Highlands (Kazakhstan)"],["Central Highlands"]]}],["region6color=#e1e4b7"],["region6description=endless and sparsely populated steppes"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Astana"]]}," (previously, ",{"type":"''","value":["Aqmola"]},") — second largest city, and capital since December 1998.

In one off case people are caught by immigration police for not having full address in the border entry card, resulting into seizing the passports causing inconvenience to the visitors. The passports needs to be collected at the immigration police office later next day after due formality.\n\nIf you have a one-entry tourist visa for 30 days, no registration is needed.

It some cheaper and even faster than hitch-hike waiting.\n\nA note of warning, getting to the Almaty airport can be expensive. Taxis to the airport vary greatly in price. Any foreigner will be quoted a very expensive rate but usually drivers will come down once they see they aren't going to be able to get that much. USD50 is outlandish.

A better option are the minibuses and buses that go to the airport. The word \"airport\" is very similar in Russian and English.\n\nA common way to get around is by unofficial taxis. Any time of day, just wave your hand and someone will stop.  Locals do this all the time.  Negotiate the price and destination before you agree to go. About USD2-4 is fair for a ride within the centre of Almaty. If your Russian is poor or non-existent, you will be charged a lot more than locals; to avoid this, try to use public buses as much as you can and don't hesitate to tell the driver how much you are ready to pay (do this before he tells you how much he wants). To be safe though, do not get in a car if more than one person is driving. Also, do not take these kind of taxis for long distances or anywhere that goes through remote areas, as there are frequent robberies, especially of foreigners.\n\nAlways try to have exact amount of money in cash (the price which you negotiated with a taxi driver), since usually they will not give you change.

For instance, it will take you almost 24 hours to get from Almaty to Astana. However, going by train is a very fun way of travelling, since the trains are a great way to meet people. A lot has been written about the pitfalls of being included in a vodka drinking party on a train, but for the most part fellow travellers are friendly, and keen to find out about you (\"why aren't you married?\" and, if you are, \"why don't you have children?\", and if you do, \"why don't they have children?\"!). Most travellers take food for the journey, as restaurant car provision is sporadic (and they expect you to share yours too!). If you don't have enough to last the distance, the trains generally stop for 15–20 minutes at each station and there are always people on the platform selling food and drink, at any time of day or night.\n\nThere is also a train called the Talgo, which is able to cover distance between Almaty and Astana in 9 hours.

You will be amazed with the taste and availability of fresh organic veggies at low price! For a treat in Almaty, try Govinda's, a delicious vegetarian Hare Krishna restaurant. Malls have food courts with some vegetarian options too.  Even some small Kazakh eateries will prepare vegetarian meals for you if you make it very clear to them (e.g. \"byez myasa\" (without meat), \"ya vegeterianetz\" (I [male] am a vegetarian), \"ya vegetarianka\" (I [female] am a vegetarian) in Russian).

You wouldn't find the cheapest ones on the web; the only way to book them is to call directly, but in that case you'll have to speak Russian at the least.\n\nThere are almost no camping sites except in Burabay\/Borovoe in Kazakhstan. You can, however, camp almost anywhere due to the huge uninhabited spots. The scenery is beautiful but because of the very hot weather: don't forget to take plenty of water with you as you can very easily spend many of days without seeing anybody. If you camp near a nomadic tribe, ask for the permission to stay near; it will not be refused.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Work"]},"\nUnlike certain European countries still recovering from recession, Kazakhstan abounds in employment or business opportunities. Skilled professionals may be able to find a job in the energy or educational sector. Salaries tend to decrease as the country is working towards ensuring equal pay for locals and expatriate staff. Expatriate candidates must obtain a work permit. In recent years, it is becoming increasingly difficult to get a work permit.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nKazakhstan is a country where the population has a long history of balanced, harmonious, multi-ethnic social interaction, where both guests and locals are treated with respect during everyday life, with certain exceptions (described below in more detail). Visitors will experience hospitality and warmth in this lovely country. However, your personal safety may vary from very safe to relatively unsafe depending on the location, time of the day, circumstances, and your personal behaviour. Unlike other former Soviet Union countries, black, South Asian and Middle Eastern people should feel comfortable.\n\nGenerally, Kazakh cities are safe during the day, but certain parts of major cities should be avoided at night to reduce risk (e.g. (i) all parts of Almaty below Tashkentskaya street and all microdistrict areas within these zones, certain other remote microdistricts, and areas with high concentration of shabby private houses (such as Shanyrak); (ii) in smaller towns, e.g. Taraz, Balkhash, Shymkent, Taldykorgan, Uralsk, Semey and Ust-Kamenogorsk, going out at night should not present a significant risk, though infrequent muggings do occur; and (iii) all smaller towns such as Shar, Stepnogorsk, and Temirtau may present a higher risk of mugging and violent crime).\n\nAlthough illegal, unfortunately ",{"type":"'''","value":["prostitution"]}," became widespread in many big cities lately. Usually prostitutes work in hotels, night clubs or saunas. Also, local classified newspapers typically have a whole section dedicated to escort services. Many sex workers in Kazakhstan are in fact from neighbouring less economically developed states such as Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.\n\nKeep your passport (or a certified copy of your passport and visa) with you at all times. While the situation improved lately, police might still try and extort money from foreigners, especially on trains and long-distance buses. Unless the officers involved are drunk, it is possible to avoid paying them by pretending not to understand, or by claiming poverty.\n\nThe risk of ",{"type":"'''","value":["violent crime"]}," is comparable with the Eastern European countries, and rougher parts of major USA cities. An ordinary tourist should not experience any violent crime and is unlikely to be a target of minor crimes, if their behaviour stays within generally accepted norms in public places.\n\nExcessive consumption of ",{"type":"'''","value":["alcohol"]}," and visiting a nightclub will always present a higher risk, especially if a person goes out alone. It is advisable to go out as a group, or even better, with locals. Late at night, people speaking foreign languages may receive extra attention from local police, who have been known to falsely accuse a person with petty crimes, make an arrest, and attempt to obtain a KZT1,000-5,000 cash payment \"fine\".  Mobile phones work in most places and should be used to call a local-language speaking friend.\n\nA foreign man soliciting a local woman on the streets or in a nightclub may draw unwanted attention from locals, or might result in arguments. Normal western attention and respect for women and children, including a smile or kind greeting, can be taken by a local husband or father as threatening or offensive.\n\nCarrying expensive phones, watches and jewellery; or otherwise demonstrating wealth in public may result in closer attention from ",{"type":"'''","value":["pickpockets"]}," and potential criminals. Outside Almaty and Astana, this should be avoided.\n\nThere is zero tolerance for any drugs, and trace amounts may result in criminal investigation, prosecution and a prison sentence. Prisons are known to be dangerous and often inhumane.\n\nCareless and ",{"type":"'''","value":["drunk driving"]}," is a problem. It is always advisable to obey traffic rules and wear seat belts. In most cities, using local taxis may present a higher risk than official public transportation due to many taxis operating unlicensed with incompetent drivers. Situations of unlicensed taxi drivers demanding additional fees before releasing luggage from their boot, or driving off and stealing luggage are more common than would be expected in western cities with a well-regulated taxi industry. It's advisable to keep your valuables and passport in your pockets and your most valuable bag on your lap.  Public transportation and taxis are much less expensive than in western cities.\n\nKazakh people have more pride than most westerners would expect. Therefore, insulting or negative comments about Kazakhstan or local Kazakhstani people will often result in arguments and possible threats of physical violence. It is not recommended to get into an argument with locals, as Kazakhstan is a nation where physical power is part of the local culture, and occasionally can lead to a fatal last argument. Do ",{"type":"'''","value":["not"]}," at all costs associate the country of Kazakhstan with the character Borat. There have been cases of violence against foreign workers in West Kazakhstan. A housing camp of Turkish workers was destroyed, with many workers assaulted, due to anger about foreigners taking local jobs and an alleged rape involving a local woman.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Embassies"]},"\nKazakhstan has most major foreign consulates and official representatives for visa needs.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["China"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=China"],["url=http:\/\/kz.china-embassy.org\/rus\/"],["email="],["address=37 Kabanbay Batyr, Astana"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+7 7172 79-35-61, +7 7172 79-35-94, +7 7172 79-35-64"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["Finland"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Finland"],["url=http:\/\/www.finland.org.kz"],["email="],["address=12 Samal Microdistrict, Astana Tower, 17 floor, Astana"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+7 7172 44-21-21"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=sanomat.AST@formin.fi"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["Greece"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Greece"],["url="],["email=gremb.ast[at]mfa.gr"],["address=109 microdistrict KARAOTKEL 2010000, Astana"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+7 7172 563714, +7 701 188 7406 (Emergencies)"],["tollfree="],["fax=+77172 563826"],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["United Kingdom"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=United Kingdom"],["url=http:\/\/ukinkz.fco.gov.uk\/en\/"],["email="],["address=British Embassy, Astana 62, Kosmonavtov St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+7 (7172) 556200"],["tollfree="],["fax=+852 2901 3066"],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["United States"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=United States of America"],["url=http:\/\/kazakhstan.usembassy.gov\/"],["email=info@usembassy.kz"],["address=Ak Bulak 4, Str. 23-22, building #3, Astana 010010"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+7 (7172) 70-21-00"],["tollfree="],["fax=+7 (7172) 54-09-14"],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["48.5"],["65.5"],["zoom=5"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Central_Asia"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecountry"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Kazakhstan"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Kazakhstan"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Asia\/Kazakhstan\/"]]}]
