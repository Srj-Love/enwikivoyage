Additionally, visitors may take a train to Pulawy (approximately 8 km away) and take either a taxi (50 złoty) or a bus\/minibus (3-4)to Kazimierz.  \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nIt is easy to walk around the town itself, as it is relatively small and compact.  There is a taxi stand operating on the main square (rynek).  For a little more excitement, there are 4x4 jeeps offering tours of the surrounding woods, limestone quarry, and ravines during the summer for approximately 50 złoty p\/person.  A short walk from the square to the river leads to a place where one can rent bicycles and scooters for an hour or a day.  \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nOn the main square is a rather large church.  Walking further up the hill leads to the ruins of a castle and guard tower, where for a few zł one can enjoy a panoramic view of the town and the Wisła.  Further up on the hill and to the right are the \"Three Crosses,\" a memorial for when a plague decimated the town's population.  \n\nWalking approximately 2.5 km down the path along the Wisła will bring you to a very large limestone quarry and boats that cross the river to take tourists to Janowiec.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nSometime during the week and on Sundays there is a morning market in the main square.  \n\nDuring the summer Kazimierz holds many known festivals in Poland including: one of the larger Folk Festivals (June); Klezmr Music Festival (mid-July); and a large, international-flavored film festival in early-to-mid-August.  \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\nKazimierz is known as an artists' town, and accordingly there are a number of galleries showcasing and selling local art.  Additionally, on market days there are many hand-made baskets and other trinkets that can be bought.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nThere are a number of restaurants in Kazimierz, ranging from the low-end to expensive.\n\nUphill from the Rynek is a 7-15 zł Kebab restaurant, while on the Rynek, Pub Mars serves basic spaghetti's and pizza's.\n\nApproximately 200 meters from the square off of Lubelska Street (heading towards the Wisła) is a traditional Jewish restaurant called 'U Fryzjera' (The Barbershop), which has live Klezmer music every Saturday night.\n\nOn Lubelska between the Rynek and the river is Zielona Tawerna (Green Tavern), where the Presidents of Poland and the Czech Republic ate in summer 2007.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nThe majority of bars are concentrated in the main square and include Rynkowa, Galeria, U Radka, Rozmaitosci, and Pub Mars.  Rynkowa shows Polish national soccer matches on a large pull-down screen, while Mars serves food, and U Radka houses a number of original works of art and always plays Rolling Stone's-style music.  Prices are almost exactly the same throughout the city, as a sort of price-fixing agreement appears to be in place.  Half liter beers are generally 7 zł, although expect to pay more in restaurants.\n\nThere are no night clubs in the town, the closest one being in Król Kazimierz a few kilometers away.  Otherwise, one must go about 9 km to Puławy for dancing\/nightlife.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Lubelskie"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Geo"],["51.316667"],["21.95"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Kazimierz Dolny"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Kazimierz Dolny"]]}]
