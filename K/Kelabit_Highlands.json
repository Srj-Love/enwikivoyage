Note that with a couple of day hike exceptions you cannot follow these trails on your own.  The trails that you follow tend to connect different local villages, and there are many branches and tracks crossing, none of which are marked.

And the Belgian guy who at one of the branches took the wrong fork (the bigger path) and was found three days later suffering from dehydration.  He had to be airlifted to hospital in Miri.  Get a guide!\n\nThere's a guide licensing system in Bario - the guides are licensed by the Sarawak Government as wildlife guides.  The licensed ones we had dealings with seemed great and to know the surroundings very well.  They also have insurance should anything untoward happen.  \n\nThe price for a guide (as of September 2010) is 80RN per guide per day for day treks, overnight camping will cost 100RN per night.  A 10RN per day tip is appropriate if you feel the guide has done a good job.  If you'd like them to provide food & cook for you, it's 25RN per person per day.  This is highly recommended as well as bringing provisions they will collect food from the jungle for you to eat in the evenings (mushrooms, sago palm hearts, etc).  Note that these are fixed prices set by the guides' association.  Attempts to bargain will not be appreciated! Expeditions to Gunung Murud and Butu Lawi require two guides for security reasons.\n\nA recommended guide is Irwan. He is very knowledgable about the jungle, has a good knowledge of English and is a very entertaining person.

The trek passes through a long stretch of primary forest but includes dirt tracks as well.
