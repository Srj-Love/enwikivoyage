Gunung Mas runs 12-seater \"Travel Bus\" from Ruteng to Kelimutu (continuing to Maumere) at 7AM and 1.30~2.PM.  It takes 10 hr from Ruteng to Kelimutu (6 hours from Bajawa) and they will pick up from hotels by prior arrangement.\n\nFrom Ende there are more options. Public cars (2 hr, Rp 40,000), Toyota Kijang are the normally the most comfortable option. Bemos (Rp 20,000) and buses (Rp 30,000) also ply the route in 2.5 hr.

It's best to walk back since it's a nice walk, and there's nothing worse than having an eager ojek driver pulling at you to leave the beautiful lakes just as the light is getting perfect for that moment.\n\nYou can rent a motorbike at many places around town for 100 000 for the day.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Mount Kelimutu"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=The main attraction.
