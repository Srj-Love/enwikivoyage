An abbey town, and since the demise of neighbouring Roxburgh, a market town, Kelso has a unique combination in the borders of Flemish inspired architecture and large French style market square. There is a plethora of historic sites in the surrounding area and its setting at the junction of the famed Salmon rivers the Tweed and the Teviot makes it a popular destination for leisure fishing. Agriculture still plays an important role in the economy of Kelso and its environs though leisure, electronics and engineering industries are now a major source of employment. Springwood Park show ground hosts a number of notable events annually bringing tourists to the town and helping to support local small business.\n\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nThe nearest major airport to Kelso is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Edinburgh"]]}," International Airport ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.edinburghairport.com"]}," which is 50 miles\/81 km away.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nKelso is probably best accessed by taking the A688 or A689 off the main north-south road in the Borders region, the A68.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nKelso is 25 miles from the nearest station at Berwick Upon Tweed on the East Coast Mainline.
