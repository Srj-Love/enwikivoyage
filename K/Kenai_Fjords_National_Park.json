Comprising an edge of the Kenai Peninsula in south central Alaska near the town of Seward, the park is home to the Harding Icefield, one of the four major ice caps in the United States. The Icefield, which covers more than half of the 700,000+ acre national park, has carved long, steep-sided water valleys, called \"fjords,\" forming the perfect habitat and aquatic environment for a wide array of marine wildlife. These plankton-rich waters are natural feeding grounds for whales on their long migrations north and south. Above sea level, the chiseled fjords reach toward the sky, home to millions of migratory birds.\n\nAlthough the Harding Icefield and other topographic relics found in the park date back to the last ice age, the Kenai Fjords area is one of constant change and activity. The rugged coastline is constantly changed by the collision of the Pacific and North American tectonic plates. These forces deepen the fjords, lower the Kenai Mountain Range, and create spectacular landscapes.\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nOvercast and cool days are frequent in this maritime climate of abundant rain. Summer daytime temperatures range from the mid-40s to low 70s (F). The wet, stormy fall begins in September. Wool or synthetic clothing and sturdy rain gear - pants, coat and hat - are essential.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Lodging"]},"\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.kenaifjordsglacierlodge.com Kenai Fjords Glacier Lodge"]},": The only lodge within Kenai Fjords National Park.
