A fair is held during Makara Sankranti (mid January). It is located on the bank of the Ajay River.  \n\nAccording to legend, Joydeb could not take bath in the river Ganges during Makar Sankranti and became very sad and disappointed. He dreamt that Goddess Ganges would change her course and flow by the side of his residence. He would find a lotus in the high tide and that would signify the flow of river Ganges. Next day, Joydeb saw a lotus floating on the river on the nearest ghat (the bathing place). Since then Kenduli became a popular place for annual fair, named after the poet. \n\nCertain places in the neighbouring state of Odisha also lay claim as the birth place of the poet Joydeb. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The nearest railway stations are at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Durgapur"]]}," (on the Howrah-Delhi track) and Dubrajpur on the Andal-Sainthia line."]},{"type":"*","value":[" It is located 7km off the Dubrajpur-Ilambazar Road.
