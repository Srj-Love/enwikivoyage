It provides information free of charge, much of which is based upon the suggestions of the local chamber of commerce.\n\nInformation about upcoming events will often be made available at the local libraries: The Kennebunk Free Library ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.kennebunkfreelibrary.org"]}," and The Louis T.

Many boats are stored on land during the winter months.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get around "]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By foot "]},"\n\nThe center of Kennebunkport is designed to accommodate the pedestrian. Sidewalks are spacious, crosswalks are common, and window-shopping is encouraged.\n\nThere is little opportunity to move between nearby towns via foot. Sidewalks end just outside the city centers. Roads can be poorly lit at night. In the wintertime, snow can limit the space on the side of the roads to the point where one must walk in traffic.  \n\nPedestrians found walking along the wrong side of the road (the right-hand side, with traffic) may be stopped and corrected by police. They will not be ticketed.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By bicycle "]},"\n\nThere are no dedicated bicycle paths in the area. Bicycles are expected to share the road with cars. Bicycles are expected to share the bridal paths with pedestrians (and sometimes horses).\n\nThe speed limits in the area are rarely over 25 miles per hour. Car drivers tend to be conscientious about road-sharing, especially off-season.\n\nWinter snow storms may make bicycle riding difficult from December to March. Ice storms make bicycle riding incredibly dangerous, but such storms are rare.\n\nThere is a helmet law in the state of Maine for bicyclists. Those who violate it may be ticketed.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By car "]},"\n\nDuring the primary tourist season (June through August), congestion in Kennebunkport can be severe. It may take ten minutes to go from one side of downtown Kennebunkport to the other - a length of approximately three hundred meters. Off-season, this trip will take about fifteen seconds.\n\nOutside of the Dock Square area, traffic is negligible at any time of year.\n\nTo park alongside one of the local beaches requires a permit. These can be purchased at the Kennebunk or Kennebunkport town halls or police stations. Their numbers are limited. As of 2010, they cost $10 for a day pass.\n\nThere are many places to park within a short walking distance of the beach, sometimes directly across the street, such that a permit is not required. Oftentimes these 'spaces' are at the edge of the road. They are of dubious legality, but are tolerated.\n\nPermits are not required between September 15th and June 15th.\n\nCars are not allowed on the beach between 11PM and 6AM, year round.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By motorcycle "]},"\n\nMaine is known to be friendly to motorcyclists.
