For the sensation of exposed rugged bedrock and a wonderful view of the town and the lake saddle up and ride to the top of the Little Amik Trail. The trail takes a small loop and is moderately challenging if only approximately one kilometre long. A good warm up.\n\nFrom the parking lot you can choose to go a little more hardcore to the North or take a scenic ride to the beaches to the South and West. Taking a turn to the left and past the Paper Mill will bring you to Scramble Ave. Go to the end of the street and you will find an advanced level trail which leads to Garrow Park on Rabbit Lake.

Big hills, big swamps and some endurance oriented excursion grinding will give you hours of sweat and enjoyment.
