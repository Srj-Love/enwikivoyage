Thus, its culinary insitutions are quite diverse.  While the city has the usual chain restaurants, including Applebees, Chili's, Red Robin, Culvers, it also has a number of very good local restaurants.  Kenosha also has a large number of bars, many serve food far above the usual bar-pizza food.\n\nKenoshans also love breakfast, and that is reflected in a number of unique breakfast places.  Most famous is Frank's Diner ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.franksdiner.com"]}," 508 - 58th Street.  Located in an historic 1920's \"diner car\" it has been featured on the Food Network's \"Diners, Drive Ins and Dives.\"  This has become a very popular place so waits can be long, especially on the weekends.  However, all of the food is home made, so the wait is worth it.  Expect big portions at reasonable prices.\n\nAnother popular breakfast option is The Coffee Pot, 4914 7th Avenue.  Like Frank's this is only open for breakfast and lunch and you may have to wait during the weekend.  \n\nWhile Frank's and The Coffee Pot are the most unique breakfast spots, there are a number of other very good (and very popular) spots, including Marina Gardens, 5001 7th Avenue and Home Run 7839 Sheridan Road.  Both are open for dinner.  Kenosha has a smoking ordinance which prohibits smoking in restaurants (unless they have a completely segregated smoking room with separate ventilation).  Both of these restaurants have these rooms.\n\ngoto the house of garhard restaurant they are known for there amazing prime rib and there authentic German food.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Best Western Executive Inn"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/book.bestwestern.com\/bestwestern\/productInfo.do?propertyCode=50118"],["email="],["address=7220 122nd Avenue"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone =+1 262 857-7699"],["tollfree=+1-800-438-3932"],["fax=+1 262 857-2698"],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Best Western Harborside Inn & Kenosha Conference Center"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/book.bestwestern.com\/bestwestern\/productInfo.do?propertyCode=50130"],["email="],["address=5125 6th Avenue"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone =+1 262 658-3281"],["tollfree="],["fax=+1 262 658-3420"],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=I-94.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["image1a=US 41.svg"],["imagesize1a=22"],["image1b="],["imagesize1b="],["directionl1=W\/N"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Milwaukee"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Racine"]]}],["directionr1=E\/S"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chicago"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gurnee"]]}],["image2=WIS 50.svg"],["imagesize2=22"],["directionl2=W"],["majorl2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Delavan"]]}],["minorl2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lake Geneva (Wisconsin)"],["Lake Geneva"]]}],["directionr2=E"],["majorr2=END"],["minorr2="]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["42.582222"],["-87.845556"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Southeast Wisconsin"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Kenosha, Wisconsin"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North_America\/United_States\/Wisconsin\/Localities\/K\/Kenosha\/"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Kenosha, Wisconsin"]]}]
