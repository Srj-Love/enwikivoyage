First, the mayor banned Santa Claus from the neighborhood in late 2001, citing the separation of Church and State. How on earth can this be possible, you ask? The mayor responded to a complaint that only a Christmas tree was displayed on the grounds of the Town Hall, to the exclusion of other religious symbols. The town government responded by removing the tree.

Inspired by the 1893 World Fair in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chicago\/Hyde Park"],["Chicago"]]},", the Seminary owner decided to build ten buildings of styles around the world. A Greek theater, a Japanese pagoda, a Dutch windmill, and many others. Following the Great Depression and WWII, the Seminary could barely make ends meet, and the entire property was commandeered by the U.S. Army's Walter Reed Medical Hospital in 1942, a hospital best known today for mistreating wounded veterans. The military went out of their way to offend local communities by demolishing historic property and generally neglecting the beautiful exotic and Victorian buildings. Gaining official historic status saved many of the buildings from demolition, but the neglect continued, allowing the elements and vandals to take their toll. In the 1980s, the \"Save Our Seminary\" group formed to protect what was left, and did an admirable job.\n\nToday, the Army has returned the historic Seminary properties to private hands, and the area looks set to have a real renaissance.
