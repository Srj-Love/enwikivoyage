The townsite of Aggassiz around Pioneer Park is on a 19th century walkable scale; park your car on Pioneer Ave and take a stroll.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Agassiz Harrison Museum and Visitor Information Centre"],["url=http:\/\/www.agassizharrisonmuseum.org"],["email=agassizharrisonmuseum@shawbiz.ca"],["address=7011 Pioneer Ave., Agassiz"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Look for the caboose at the west end of Pioneer Park"],["phone=+1 604-796-3545"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Mo–Sa 10am–4pm, Sun 1pm–4pm"],["price=By donation"],["content=The 1893 Canadian Pacific Railroad (CPR) stationhouse has been transformed into a museum of Agassiz and of CPR history.
