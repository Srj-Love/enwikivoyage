It is said that Claiborne liked being on Kent Island so much that he decided to make it his permanent home, and he started what would become the oldest English settlment in Maryland.  Ever since then Kent Island has thrived as the crossroads of the Chesapeake.  Several people, from founding fathers en route between Annapolis and Philadelphia, to vacationers on their way to Ocean City, have visited the island.

The Cross Island Trail, as its name implies, goes across the island from Terrapin Park to Kent Narrows, and the Kent Island South Trail goes from Matapeake Park to Romancoke Pier.  The trails unfortunately do not connect with each other, but there are plans to fix that in the future along with another trail south of Route 50, connecting Kent Narrows with Chester.
