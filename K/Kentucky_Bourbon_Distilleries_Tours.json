This is attributed to an abundance of corn (the primary source of grain in bourbon), limestone in the ground producing pleasant spring water, and alternating hot summers and cold winters, which help the bourbon seep in and out of the barrels to age quickly.\n\nThe Kentucky Distillers' Association (KDA) promotes tours of bourbon distilleries on an official ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/kybourbontrail.com\/ Kentucky Bourbon Trail"]}]},". Distilleries on the trail offer tours, most lasting about an hour, where they teach you about how they make their bourbon. The process is nearly the same at each one; it's subtle differences that give each its distinctive flavor. The tour guides will explain the basics of bourbon, but they also love answering detailed questions, especially if it gives him a chance to explain why they think their bourbon is better than everyone else's!\n\nAnd, of course, all of the distilleries offer you a taste of their products at the end of the tour.
