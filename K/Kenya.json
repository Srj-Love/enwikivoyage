There is also a fine selection of stores selling craft goods in Mombasa, where the atmosphere is somewhat more relaxed. However, the best prices can be found by buying direct from the artisans in their villages in the countryside.\n\nApart from the typical souvenirs such as wood carvings, it may be a good idea to buy one of the large books with photos of wildlife, nature, or culture.\n\nDo listen to and buy some local Kenyan music. Reggae is also quite a frequent feature of matatu journeys.\n\nThe currency is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Kenyan Shilling (KES)"]},", which can be divided into 100 cents. As of June 2014, USD1 = KES87, €1 =  KES119, and GBP1 = KES149\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nNairobi has some of the finest eating establishments in Africa. Many different cuisines and types of restaurants are available, from fast food to fancy. Many five-star hotels have attached fine restaurants, which are expensive but worth it if you are looking to not get a true Kenyan cuisine. Restaurants are called \"hotels\" and there are many in Nairobi, if you stop by make sure you try Pilau-a chicken and rice dish, cabbage and rice; and the staple food in Kenya-Ugali, made from maize flour. Street food is also definitely worth a try and usually safe to eat, Mandazi are sweet bread-like treats that are often sold on the street, maize grilled with a side of chilli to add on is a wonderful snack and very cheap,  samosas are awesome and don't be hesitant to try all the other yummy stuff they're selling! Also, fruit stand are everywhere-the mangoes and avocados are to die for and can be bought for about 10-20bob. Many restaurants can be found downtown and in the areas of Westlands and Hurlingham but these areas are filled with tourists and \"mzungu\"(singular) \"wazungu\" (plural) which is the kiSwaihili word for \"white\/foreign people\" and places like Ayani, Olympic, Kibera, and other places have more authentic food. Among the many cuisines available are Indian, Brazilian, Chinese, Thai, Japanese, German and French restaurants. Fast food restaurants, mostly by South African chains (Steers, Nandos), are common in the larger urban areas. There is also a restaurant called \"The Carnivore\" in Nairobi which serves a plethora of \"all you can eat\" exotic meats from the usual beef to zebra, crocodile and ostrich. While expensive, there is a lot of food to be eaten and it is worth venturing in to for the experience if nothing else!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nKenyan beer is excellent,having won various awards internationally, the local favourite being Tusker, a brand from the East African Breweries Company. Imported beers are available but aren't that much popular due to the high retail prices brought on by import duty and local loyalty to their own manufactured products.\nIn recent years brew pubs, such as the Brew Bistro and Sierra in Nairobi, have taken upon themselves to indulge Kenyans in their own productions which has attracted both expatriate and tourist attention due to their smoothness of their creations.\n\nImported and local wines and spirits are widely available, and it is advisable to avoid local brews such as \"changaa\" and \"busaa,\" which are illegal, un-hygienically brewed and whose consumption has led to deaths on many occasions. It may be helpful to remember that \"changaa\" literally means \"kill me quick\" before deciding whether or not to drink a proffered glass of the beverage.\n\nThere is an excellent selection of soft drinks especially from the Coca Cola stable, but try the Stoney \"Tangawizi\" Ginger ale locally produced.\n\nIt is also worth noting, as is the way in many African countries, that when you return an empty glass bottle of a drink to certain shop keepers, they will refund you part of the price you paid known as deposit that covers the cost of lost bottles.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nNairobi has a wide variety of tourist ",{"type":"'''","value":["hotels"]},", from backpackers' camp sites (Upper Hill camp site off Hospital Road) to five-star establishments such as the Norfolk Hotel. There are a number of other guesthouses that offer private rooms both with shared bathrooms and self-contained rooms for between 1,000\/- and 4,000\/- per night. As long as you don't mind basic accommodations, there is no need to spend more than US$100 per night on a hotel or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["hostel"]]},". In less touristy areas, lodging can be found for as cheap as US$5 per night. Be wary of bed bugs, though - it may be advisable to purchase insect spray and bring along your own sheet if you plan to travel very cheaply. In addition, the international Intercontinental and Hilton chains are also represented as well as a number of very highly regarded local chains (Serena and Sarova Hotels). Small boarding and lodging establishments are ubiquitous in central urban areas for low cost, although these are rarely safe as they are located in high crime areas.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Homestays"]}," are increasingly gaining popularity. Part of the reason is that one can experience Kenyan culture in a deeper and more meaningful way. Most homes charge about $20 per night inclusive of meals. Some may include laundry on that price.\n\nPeople staying ",{"type":"'''","value":["longer-term"]}," may rent accommodation; prices range from estate-agent 'international style' rentals at $150+ pw, to privately arranged furnished apartments, from $50–$100 pw, to 'local' style accommodation, usually unfurnished, in a price range from ksh5-7000 per month with windows, water, electricity, down to ksh500 per month with no windows, no electricity, loud neighbours, mosquitoes, and shared access to a tap. To arrange privately rented accommodation, you'll need to ask around - cab drivers, shopkeepers, market traders, could all save you the estate agents' fees.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Learn"]},"\nThere are a large number of colleges offering secretarial and computer courses in the CBD's of Nairobi and Mombasa.\nThere are also a large number of universities, both public and private, and some do participate in student exchange programs with international universities.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Work"]},"\nA high unemployment rate means work permits are required. These can be difficult to obtain unless you have specialized skills that are lacking in the workforce. You are best off being appointed abroad, as local employment opportunities are low-paying and few.\n\nThere are many international expatriates who work for non-profit agencies such as the UN and other affiliated agencies. Their pay is very high in relation to local living standards, and as a result their employees can afford to live in luxury.\n\nThere are numerous opportunities for volunteering in Kenya, whatever skills you have. Websites such as Idealist carry details of many of these placements, which could be centred on education, conservation, community development, or a number of similar areas. Kenya's English-speaking history and relative stability (despite recent events following the disputed 2007 elections) make it extremely well suited for this kind of work. In most cases, volunteering can be undertaken with a standard tourist visa, although it is worth checking with your host organization before travelling as the authorities may not always take this view.\n\nIf you have specialised skills, there are a number of more focused volunteering programs available. These range from opportunities for medical and engineering placements (for example, with MSF or VSO), to short sabbaticals for people with generic business experience, spent mentoring local businesses, with Skills Venture.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nKenya had an uncharacteristic bout of post-election violence in January 2008 after a disputed presidential election result.  Things have now quieted down and the country is safe for travellers.\n\nStay alert when walking or driving through ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nairobi"]]},". You should always be careful to be aware of your surroundings and, if possible, ensure that you have a guide with you.  Even daylight muggings on crowded streets are not uncommon. Infrequently, violent and sometimes fatal criminal attacks, including armed carjackings and home invasions\/burglaries can occur at any time and in any location, particularly in Nairobi. Particularly avoid walking after dark. Take a taxi if you can afford it, or a bus if you can not, but care should be taken as most buses, even modern ones, tend to be overcrowded and can pose dangers from pickpocketing.\n\nAvoid ostentatious displays of wealth and property, particularly tempting objects such as cameras, mobile phones, laptops, MP3 players, etc. The bus from the airport to downtown Nairobi is a notorious target for pickpockets.\n\nIf you are unlucky and get mugged, a good tactic is to wave your arms and start screaming at the would-be mugger. Confrontations with armed robbers, however, should be avoided – in this instance, remember that your possessions are far less important than your life. Most criminals in Nairobi are more interested in a quick grab and dash than they are in a prolonged encounter. Since robbery is frequently punished by lengthy prison terms or even death, most muggers can be dissuaded by a good show of force. Like in any other city, it is perfectly possible to see, and enjoy, much of Nairobi without incident if you take sensible precautions.\n\nThe north of the country has a reputation for lawlessness, becoming more dangerous the closer you get to the South Sudanese, Ethiopian and Somali borders. Armed robberies and abductions by ",{"type":"''","value":["shiftas"]}," (bandits) on the roads in these areas are frequent. Avoid travelling to this part of the country if possible, and take special precautions if travelling by road. Armed convoys are normal for this part of the country. Visitors to Lake Turkana (indicated on the map as Lake Rudolf) in the northwest and Lamu in the northern end of the coast should travel there by air. Lodwar, Lokichokio ('Loki') and Moyale are towns best avoided by the casual traveller, unless you have business with the humanitarian organizations based there.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\nProtect yourself from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["mosquitoes"]]},", as they carry numerous diseases such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["dengue fever"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["malaria"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["yellow fever"]]},". Get expert advice on malaria preventatives. Guard against mosquito bites. Wear long sleeves and long trousers and apply an effective insect repellent, for example, one containing DEET. If travelling to other East African countries, you should have a yellow fever vaccination so as to prevent complications and paying of bribes at the border. These can be administered at an affordable price at most reliable Nairobi clinics and hospitals.\n\nMalaria prophylactics, taken as pills during the trip, can be highly effective. Consult your physician. The prophylactics most commonly used in this region are doxycycline (an antibiotic) and malarone (a combination of atovaquone and proguanil, also sold locally as malanil). (Chloroquine is not as useful because of the high incidence of resistance. Mefloquine, also known as lariam, mefliam, and mephaquin, is associated with various side effects, including a high incidence of mood disturbances and a lower risk of severe neurological disturbance.)\n\nIf you get flu-like symptoms, including fever, joint aches and vomiting, consult a doctor immediately. If no doctor is available, take a treatment dose of an appropriate anti-malarial and go immediately to a hospital. While the public hospitals are slightly cheaper, long waits and poor conditions and care at these facilities may make it worthwhile to go to a private clinic. Costs will vary, but a typical trip to the hospital for malaria testing, doctor's consultation, and medication will cost USD12-30 depending on the clinic. As malaria can become serious, a trip to the hospital is recommended at the first symptoms of malaria.\n\nIf you get such symptoms within twelve months of returning home, seek a doctor's advice very quickly and immediately tell him where you have been in the last year. Delayed treatment, even by just a few hours, can lead to permanent brain and liver damage or death.\n\nDo not have unprotected sex as ",{"type":"'''","value":["HIV\/AIDS"]}," and other sexually transmitted diseases are a risk. The country's Adult HIV Prevalence rate (15th in the world) is over ",{"type":"'''","value":["6%"]}," or ",{"type":"'''","value":["1 in 16"]}," adults. Voluntary Testing and Counselling (VCT) clinics offer free testing and counselling for HIV\/AIDS.\n\nCholera is another danger. When in affected areas, see a doctor immediately and drink plenty of water.\n\nAll water should be treated, either by boiling or through purifying tablets or filters. This includes Nairobi as well as rural areas. Typhoid fever is a risk and, like malaria prophylactics, the vaccination is not 100% effective. It is advisable to buy bottled water for drinking. It is available countrywide. All fruits and vegetables should be thoroughly washed. While eating from the roadside kiosks is part of the cultural experience that one should not miss, note that such places do not always have the highest sanitary conditions and stomach illnesses can result.\n\nIt is advisable to have travel and accident insurance.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Respect"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["ramadandates"]]},"\nAlthough Kenya is predominantly Christian and somewhat liberal, there are areas with major Muslim influence, such at the Coastal regions, where it is considered indecent to wear short dresses.  This is true in rural Christian areas as well. The locals, however, are extremely friendly.\n\nBeachwear is acceptable on the beach but not while strolling around town. Even though some hotels allow topless or nude sunbathing, these are in restricted areas and not in public areas.\n\nKissing or heavy petting is frowned upon in public, even though Kenyan youth engage in both, liberally in night clubs.\n\nHomosexuality is against the law but is practised secretly. Any overt displays of homosexuality (especially male to male relationships) may, at times, result in open hostility. Although violent reactions are quite uncommon, It is best to be discreet if engaging in any such activities with travel mates or locals. However, it is customary to hold a same sex person's hand while engaged in conversation.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Internet"]},"\nInternet cafés are common throughout Kenya and usually offer decent link quality.
