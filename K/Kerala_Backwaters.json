Traditionally used as one of the main transportation alleys, today backwaters offer a rejuvenating experience for tourists visiting Kerala. \n\nThe backwaters can be explored by hiring a boat for one or several days.

Meandering through the coastal areas of Kerala is a 900 kilometers (560 miles) long intricate network of lagoons, lakes, canals, estuaries and deltas of several rivers that flow into the Arabian Sea. This is a natural phenomenon, as major rivers and streams that flows within Kerala drain themselves into backwaters regions, resulting in creation of several small land strips, lagoons, islands etc, which opens to sea at few areas. Thus backwaters are one of the largest fresh-water sources and rich in marine habitat as well as adds to natural beauty. Kerala has 3 backwater regions.\n\nThe most beautiful and accessible part of the back waters is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Vembanad backwater"]}," stretch located in  districts of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cochin"],["Ernakulam"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alapuzha"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kottayam"]]}," area. Vembanadu lake is the longest lake in South Asia and listed as prestigious Ramsar sites, with rich bio-diversity. The north Vembanadu lake opens to sea at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cochin"]]}," harbour. The Cochin coast is dotted with numerous islands interconnected by ferries and bridges, adorning the Queen of the Arabian Sea like a necklace of pearls. The islands break the waves from the sea, thus ensuring that the back waters are calm and navigable. Among the islands, Wellingdon Island deserves special mention as it houses the Port of Cochin and the largest Naval presence in India: the Southern Naval Command. \n\nThe southern Vembanadu lake is world-renowned for its natural beauty and large expanse of water, sandwiched between district of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alapuzha"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kottayam"]]},".

Kettuvallom loosely translated means: ‘roofed boat’. They can be as long as 70 foot, with a 30 ton capacity, made with wooden planks joined and tied together with coconut ropes and painted with cashew nut oil outside. Nowadays many kettuvalloms have been converted to House Boats by enterprising boat owners with amenities like beds, kitchens, bars & toilets. The entire houseboats are constructed with natural eco-friendly materials like bamboo, coir, palm leaves and wood. Normally house-boats have 2 or 3 bed rooms with large lobby area, a kitchen and crew rooms. Some larger house-boats are even two storied with open terrace and observation deck connected with bamboo stair case. A few house-boats are floating conference halls to conduct meetings and DJ parties.\n\nThey are available on hire for fixed rates (varies according to the season). The package usually includes tour along the backwater with stops at various place with historical or cultural importance. The menu usually includes the fresh water catch along with the seasonal sea food and Kerala vegetarian dishes. Guests who require special menus as well as vegetarian foods in certain specific styles, must inform the crew or operator office, atleast one day before the cruise. Packages include cost of food and all regular amenities. Guests can swim in the backwaters, only in the areas, authorized by houseboat crew.  Most of the house-boat operates on 22 hour cruise, starting from 12:00 Noon to 10:00 AM next day. The houseboats will be anchored from evening 8:00 pm onwards and morning 06:00 am next day, as government laws prohibit night movements due to tidal waves and remoteness of areas. Now a days, house-boats are available for 8 hour cruise package for larger crowds, who do not prefer staying over-night.\n\nThe backwaters flow through almost all the districts of Kerala -- ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alappuzha"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Thiruvananthapuram"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ernakulam"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kottayam"]]},", etc. Almost all the stretches have breathtaking views.

That's exactly happens when you are in a house-boat.\n\nThe Kerala tourism, while aggressively promoting backwater tourism made a policy to provide an avenue or opportunity for tourists to remain idle for a day, wind off stress and relax to rewind back to life. The house-boats are equipped with all comfortable facilities to relax, however most of them do not provide televisions and radio-sets as a general policy. The only thing to do, thus is to appreciate the natural beauty and rewind to past memories of life.\n\nRecently many houseboat operators started innovative programs to engage guests, by providing them fishing at the backwaters and allowing guests to make a catch and eat it according their style of cooking\n\nLikewise, many house-boats now-a-days anchor at local vegetable markets and allow guests to choose their vegetables, to cook food as per their choice. Likewise in evenings, the houseboats are anchored near local toddy shops where guests can treat themselves with traditional Kerala palm toddies and shop special snacks.\n\nAnother innovative thing, is to do shopping at Floating supermarkets operated by Triveni Co-op. With more than 2000 groceries items and other essentials, this is a native retail innovation, to cater people living islands. The supermarkets are built inside large motorized boats and on-request the houseboat crew brings it closer to supermarket, allowing the guests to enter. A pretty good-idea to have mid-water shopping!\n\n:*",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.tourindiakerala.com Tourindia"]}]},": Pioneers in backwater tourism, who introduced the first Kettuvallam Houseboat into the backwaters of Kerala years back in 1991, having a fleet of Houseboats, who are the finalits WTTC (World Travel & Tourism Council) award for the Community Benefit in Bejing 2010, provides special made holidays all over India, Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka,  mail:tourindia@vsnl.com, Tel.: +914712328070, 2331507, 2330437 00919895605243.
