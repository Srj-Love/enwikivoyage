The South Limburg area was commonly disputed between different duchies and nations around it, and Herzogenrath changed hands repeatedly. It was ruled over time by the Duchy of Brabant, by Spain and later by the French. When the Kingdom of the Netherlands was formed after the French revolutionairy and Napoleonic wars, the area's ownership was determined at the Vienna Congress. There, the border was drawn right through the middle of historic Herzogenrath, creating the two adjoining towns of Kerkrade in the Netherlands and modern day ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Herzogenrath"]]}," in Germany. When the Belgians declared their independence, they claimed the Kerkrade area as their own, but Dutch ownership was eventually restored in 1839.\n\nIn 1104, a abbey was founded in former Herzogenrath, by an Angustian priest named Ailbertus. After his death, his bones were buried in the abbey's crypt. The monks of Rolduc started coal mining activities in the area in the 18th century and received the sole right to exploit the coal mines on Kerkrade's soil in 1723. They thus laid the foundations for what would become the main economic activity in the town and the whole region.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the first state mines were opened. Coal mining became the beating heart of the region's economy and the main source of income for many of its people. When all the mines were closed in the 60's, Kerkrade partly impoverished. Still considered one of the underdeveloped parts of the region by some, Kerkrade is not a main travelers destination. However, as renovations and facilities development take place, the town is gaining tourist popularity rapidly.\n\nTravelers who do take the effort to visit Kerkrade will find a good number of interesting sights as well a good attractions in and directly around town.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nThere is a train station in Kerkrade, which is served by regional trains and connects the town to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Landgraaf"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Heerlen"]]},".
