According to legend, Padmasambhava was reincarnated into a lotus blossom as an eight year old child, and from very young he possessed great wisdom and insight. Furthermore, he had mastery of the elements and so like a potter shaping clay into pots, he transformed harmful action and substances into something positive and beneficial. \n\nGuru Rinpoche is credited with introducing Tantric Buddhism into Tibet and is specifically associated with the Nyingma tradition, the form of Buddhism that the Sherpas brought with them when they migrated over the Himalayas into Nepal in 16th century.

While many of the routes through the mountains are arduous, there are ample places to rest and enjoy a meal along the way. Furthermore, don't worry about getting lost: just ask a local the way to the next village on your route, and they will direct you. Most Sherpas under the age of fifty can at least understand basic English, and many speak it fluently. \n\nWhile trekking is possible in this area the whole year round, the best times to visit are from the beginning of March to mid May and from the beginning of September to end of November. The winters are very cold and snow may make it difficult to travel higher than Tengboche, and also lodges may be closed above this altitude. Summers, on the other hand, are wet, and the spectacular peaks often lost in the clouds. April and early May is a good time to see the hedgerows and trees bursting into bloom, with Rhododendrons, in particular, adding a spectacular splash of colour to the landscape. However, dust from the plains of India during the spring routinely provide less than ideal conditions for clear mountain views. The views are much better after the summer monsoons have cleared the atmosphere of dust, but the days are shorter and cooler.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["TIMS"]}," (Trekking Information Management System) permits are required to venture fout for any trek, also for the Khumbu region, they are easy to obtain in Kathmandu at Nepal Tourism Board against US$20, a recent passport s√≠ze photo and filling in the required form before you embark to your trek. If you are with an organized trekking party your tour operator will do this for you.\n\nAlso a National Park Entry Fee is required and can be obtained either in Kathmandu or while entering the Park.\n\nLodges and restaurants in Khumbu only accept Nepalese rupees. Budget can vary hugley between 1500-2000 rs per person per day for food and accommodation - prices rise with the altitude, though you may spend more in Namche because there is more on offer.

However, as the majority of goods are carried over from Tibet, which is much nearer to Khumbu than Kathmandu, you might find a few bargains and some unique items. Also, check out the clothing made from yak wool. This is often made locally, and so the prices may be lower than in Kathmandu.

Tea, instant coffee and a drink made from lemon concentrate are the cheapest beverages in the region, and are available in every lodge or tea shop for between 25 to 50rs a cup.

Use iodine tablets as a purifier or purchase boiled water. Exceptions: Namche and Phortse have clean water supplies that the locals drink directly from the tap.

Furthermore, boiled water can be purchased at all lodges, so bringing a personal container avoids the need to purchase bottled water - which anyway is very expensive. Wood for fires should be used sparingly, and not at all when possible.
