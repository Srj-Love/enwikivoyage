The bus leaves from a 'bus station' 100m east of the entrance to the lake, on rd '15', just after it splits from Gadisar Rd. You'll know you're in the right place if there is a small shrine at the base of a sloping tree. Buses leave from that side of the road on a rough schedule, so you'll have to ask. Warning - The ticket sellers on this route are particularly fond of overcharging (up to Rs150 each way per person), by making up a fictitious 'luggage charge' and 'convenience charge'. The price is currently Rs35 each way (June 2012), so be sure to not overpay. Make sure to ask the price of the trip from other bus riders to make it easier, otherwise taking a photo of the offending conductor will often do the trick."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Camel Safari"]},", To near by sand dunes.
