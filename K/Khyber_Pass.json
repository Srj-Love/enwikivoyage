Today, with the region in the center of an ongoing armed confict, it is clearly ",{"type":"'''","value":["far too dangerous for most travellers"]},".\n\nThe area is inhabited by Pathans or Pushtuns, rather fierce Pushtu-speaking hill tribes. On the map, it was a border region of the British Raj and is now part of Pakistan, but neither the British nor the Pakistani government have ever really controlled it; Pathan tribal chiefs run everything. Pathan territory spans the border. 60% of them live in Pakistan, 40% in Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, they are the largest ethnic group at 40-odd% of the population and have often dominated government and business.\n\nThe Pathans have twice defeated the greatest armies of their day. When Alexander the Great wanted to cross the pass, he could not manage it until he bribed some Pathans to assist him against others. At the height of British power in Queen Victoria's reign, the Khyber was the border of the Raj; Britain fought several wars in the area and never completely subdued it. In the first Afghan war (1840s), a force of 16,000 (4500 soldiers plus grooms, cooks, etc.) went in and ",{"type":"''","value":["one man came out alive"]},".

That movement originated in Pakistan and only later — with help from the CIA and Pakistani Intelligence, who saw it as a counter to Mujahadeen warlord power — took over Afghanistan. Among its strongest influences are the traditional Pathan code of ethics, ",{"type":"''","value":["Pashtunwali"]},", and the Deobandi branch of Islam. Deobandi is a fundamentalist Sunni movement emphasizing Shari'a Law which arose in India in the 19th century and is now common among Pathans. At one time it was heavily funded by Saudi Arabia because it resembles their own Wahabi style of Islam and was seen as a counter to the influence of Shi'a Iran, especially in Afghanistan.\n\nSince 1980, Pathans have been fighting Russians, various other Afghans, American and allied forces, the Pakistani army, and sometimes each other. Many — both pro and anti-Taliban, and on both sides of the border — are still (2013) fiercely resisting various efforts by US and allied forces and\/or the Afghan and Pakistani governments to control their area.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nThe local language is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pashto"]]},", but many people also speak Pakistan's ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Urdu"]]}," or Afghanistan's ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dari"]]},".
