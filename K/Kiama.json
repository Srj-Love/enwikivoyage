With the area established with farming, it has been a tourist destination for day trips and weekends from Sydney for over a century.\n\nJust over 90 minutes south of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sydney"]]}," by car, or just over 2 hours by rail, it's famous for its spectacular coastline and surrounding rural scenery. With a population of more than 20,000, the local government area covers 256 sq km; the main urban centres are Kiama, Gerringong, Jamberoo, Gerroa, and Kiama Downs \/ Minnamurra.\n\nKiama has a rich heritage based on dairy farming and quarrying. Today's economy remains strongly supported by rural activities as well as a burgeoning tourism industry. The area has a vibrant arts sector and a strong sense of community.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Mapframe"],["-34.67"],["150.85"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nKiama is around 30 minutes past ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wollongong"]]}," and just over 90 minutes from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sydney"]]},".

Trains run every hour or so, but it's worth checking the timetable before your trip. Kiama is part of the suburban network, and no reservations are possible or necessary. It's an easy walk from the train station to the beach, the blowhole, and the shopping centre.\n\nOff-peak (weekends, and after 9am) return tickets are $10.80 for adults and $5.40 for children. It's worth considering as a Sunday Funday destination, when a family can travel for $2.50 per person.\n\nA stopover on the way is to get off at the station before Kiama—Bombo Beach—the only railway station on a beach in the whole of Australia.  You can walk from Bombo to Kiama over the headland in about half an hour.  The train tunnels straight through the headland to do the trip in a couple of minutes.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bicycle"]},"\n\nA bicycle route stretches from Bulli in all the way down the coast to Kiama, with only a short stretch on the main road.  The route from Dunmore station down to Kiama is all off-road or quiet road.  There are a few steep hills going over the headlands as you come into Kiama, with the final one probably the steepest.  The cycleway follows the rail line for large parts of the final section.  The rail route includes tunnels through the headland, leaving the cyclist to ride over it.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Little_Blowhole,_Kiama_1_.jpg"],["thumb"],["The Little Blowhole"]]},"\nKiama is located on some of the most picturesque and beautiful coastline on the South Coast of New South Wales.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Kiama Blowhole and Lighthouse"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat=-34.67185"],["long=150.86317"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=Free"],["content=In the right tide and surf conditions, especially with a south-easterly wind, the blowhole sprays water high into the air.
