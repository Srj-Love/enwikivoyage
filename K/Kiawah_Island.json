So, no matter where you rent - see interior photos of the villa that you are renting - no one wants \"surprises\" on arrival.\n# Be sure to read on-line comments provided by guests that have stayed at Kiawah.  \n\nKiawah Island has a newly constructed hotel called the Sanctuary. Rooms at the Sanctuary can be expensive, particularly if you want one with an ocean view. They can be as high as $600-$800 per night. If you're going during the off season, you may be better off renting a private home or villa. You'll usually get a really good deal on one, particularly booking at the last minute. These homes and villas are privately owned and the owners will usually rent through one of several rental agencies on the island. However, when renting through a rental agency other than Kiawah Island Golf and Tennis resort, access to some of the amenities may be limited.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=KiawahExclusives"],["alt=Kiawah Island Vacation Rentals"],["url=http:\/\/www.kiawahislandescapes.com"],["email="],["address=4343 Betsy Kerrison Parkway, Johns Island,SC 29455"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone ="],["tollfree=+1-800-845-6966"],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin=4:00"],["checkout=10:30"],["content=Offering Kiawah Island Vacation Rental Homes and Villas."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Kiawah Island Golf Resort"],["url=http:\/\/www.kiawahislandescapes.com"],["email="],["address=One Sanctuary Beach Dr."],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone ="],["tollfree=+1-800-654-2924"],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=The official resort of Kiawah Island."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Charleston (South Carolina)"],["Charleston"]]}]},": Charleston is a beautiful and historic port city located just 27 miles inland from Kiawah Island.
