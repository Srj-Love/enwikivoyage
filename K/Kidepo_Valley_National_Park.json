Roads are poor - many routes may have sand, mud, washboards, stream crossings and deep ruts that require vehicles with 4-wheel drive and or significant ground clearance.

Localized heavy tsetse infestations make closed vehicles with sealable windows preferable.\n\nDriving off-track is prohibited and hazardous. Driving anywhere North of the reintroduction boma, including into the Kidepo valley, requires a ranger escort.\n\nThe presence of dangerous game dictates that most travel within the park is by vehicle.
