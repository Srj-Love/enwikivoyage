Kiev is one of the oldest cities in Eastern Europe, dating back to the 5th century, although settlements at this location existed much earlier. By the late 9th century, Kiev was at the centre of an emerging Eastern Slavic state. Between the 10th and early 13th centuries, the city reached its golden age as the capital of the first Ukrainian state known today as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Kievan Rus"]},", (",{"type":"''","value":["Kyivan Ruthenia, or Rus-Ukraine"]},"). It was this state that shaped the religious and cultural foundations of the modern Slavic eastern European states.\nIn the middle of the 13th century, Kievan Rus was overrun by the Mongols. Later that century, Kiev became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1569 the city was absorbed into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1654 the Cossack, Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky, \"liberated\" Kiev from that Commonwealth but then promptly folded it into Russian hegemony in an action that continues to be a sore point for Ukrainian nationalists.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Kiev Opera.jpg"],["thumb"],["National Opera House"]]},"\n\nFull Russian annexation came in 1775 and the city remained under Russian rule, with brief independence between 1918 and 1920 during the chaos that followed the Russian revolution. Over these two centuries, Kiev experienced growing Russification and Russian immigration. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, it became the capital of independent Ukraine and is now discovering its place as a large European capital.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Maidan Nezalezhnosti.jpg"],["thumb"],["Maidan Nezalezhnosti"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nAverage temperatures are maximum 26°C (79°F) \/ minimum 15°C (59°F) in summer and maximum -2°C (28°F) \/ minimum -8°C (17°F) in winter. Spring and autumn (fall) can be very brief. Heat waves featuring temperatures as high as 38°C (100°F) are rare but not unheard of in the summer months and brief but potent cold spells with temperatures as low as -20°C (-4°F) are not uncommon in winter.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nIn general the people in Kiev are hospitable and will be eager to help you.

Most maps and signposts are translated into English. Additionally, every stations has got its unique three-digit number, with the first digit showing the number of line (M1 for red, M2 for blue, and M3 for green). Once on board, every station is announced by loud speakers and TV screens. These screens show a lot of weird ads between the stations, but flag an impending station before arrival. Upon departure, they then show the next station.\n\nMetro stations where you can interchange have two different names - one for each line. If you are changing lines, the other station can be reached by an overpass in the centre or near one of the ends of the platform.\n\nTrains run every 30 to 150 seconds during business hours, every 5 minutes after 20:00, and every 10–15 minutes after 22.30. Last trains depart from the terminal stations around midnight, so your last chance to catch a train in the city centre is between 00.15 and 00.25 (check the timetable of late departures, which is signposted on each station). Trains are often very crowded. Be prepared to push, as this may be the only way you get on the train during peak hours.\n\nIt's interesting to note that the Kiev metro has some of the deepest stations in the world. The Arsenalna station (Ukrainian: Арсенальна) station is the deepest metro station in the world, at 107m deep, and the Universytet station (Ukrainian: Університет) has one of the longest escalators (87m long). Many stations have two long and intimidating escalators in a row.\n\nIf you enable \"Cell Info Display\" on your GSM phone, it will show you the name of the station (in transliterated Latin characters (for UMC and Kyivstar subscribers) just like your map) when you are underground in the vicinity of a station. Your mobile\/cell\/handy should work on most of the network, including between stations.\n\nSpend some time looking at the stations.

Tickets cost UAH1.50 and are normally available from a conductor on board (oddly enough, they first sell you as many tickets as you want, then asks you to validate one).

There the fate was solved for many princes pretending to the Kyivan throne on the one hand, and fate of Kyiv itself, on the other hand. Numerous invaders carried out from here their multiple attacks on Kyiv, and Kyivan princes conducted bloody battles with them. Such a strategic importance of this location became one of the reasons for foundation of a monumental church-fortress. In 1139 Vsevolod Olhovych, Prince of Chernigiv approached Dorogozhychi, an important strategic point, on the Kyiv’s north-western outskirts, gained possession of the area and simultaneously obtained a convenient bridgehead at the approaches to Kyiv. In 1140–1146 Vsevolod Olhovych erects St. Cyril’s Church at Dorogozhychi. Construction of a church-fortress is a logical step of Vsevolod as a prince-worrier, and prince-strategist, for the sake of fortifying outskirts of the “capital city” so desired by many. St. Cyril’s monastery is an example of a unique functional combination, because it is a sacred center, patrimonial palace church, and at the same time it is a monumental church-fortress. The church was named after Cyril, the holy hierarch Cyril of Alexandria — Christian patron of the church’s founder, prince Vsevolod Olhovych. - The most precious treasure of the St. Cyril’s Church is its unique ",{"type":"'''","value":["mural painting"]},". - In the 12th century walls of the St. Cyril’s Church were painted in fresco technique according to the Christian iconographic canons of that time. In the 17th century the fresco painting of the Church was partially renewed by means of tempera. In the 1800's, during repair of the Church its walls instead of painting were just plastered and whitewashed. - In the 1880s restoration works were carried out in the Church under the guidance of the professor of St. Petersburg University, A. Prakhov. At that time from under centuries-old layers of plaster and whitewash a unique Old Russian mural painting was discovered. However, soon after, in order to provide the mural painting for “grandeur” the frescoes were refreshed with oil paints. In the 1970s a large-scale restoration works on frescoes’ discovery from under layer of oil paint of the 19th century were carried out. - FRESCO painting: Monumental figures of twelve Apostles are located in window piers of the dome’s drum. Four Evangelists are portrayed on sails (architectural spherical triangles serving for transition from the drum’s cycle to the under-dome square). The representation of the EvangelisMark on the south-estern sail has preserved the best of all.- Central arches supporting the dome’s drum are decorated with images of theSeban Martyrs placedewithin medallions literally interconnected by means of loops and hoops. These representations form as if “alive holy chain” protecting the celestial sphere. In the central apse there is a figure of the Holy Mother, Orans with her hands raised in prayer. Oil painting of the 19th century represents the major part of the composition; of the ancient fresco representation only an edge of the Holy Mother’s blue chiton and a podium on which she is standing have survived. Beneath the Orans the Eucharist fresco composition is located featuring the scene of the Apostles’ holy communion, in which the Christ is depicted twice: at the left He serves the body of Christ (bread) to the group of Apostles headed by the St. Peter, and at the right He serves the blood of Christ (cup of wine) to the group of Apostles headed by St. Paul. Similar plot depicting two figures of Christ is already known in miniature of Rossan Code in Asia Minor dated with the 6th century. According to the canon which can be recognized already in the Church of San-Vitale in Ravenna, in the St. Cyril’s Church the center of the composition represents a double dome on pillars over the throne onwhich a cross, a paten with seven round flat breads, a cup of wine and an asterisk are placed. - ",{"type":"'''","value":["Belfry"]},": Of the monastic buildings Ivan Hryhorovych-Barskyi constructed within the monastery, his most important construction was a free standing belfry, built in 1760. The belfry combined the idea of a tall campanile with a gate on the ground level and a chapel on the belfry's second tier. The two lower levels of the belfry had some elements of a Ukrainian tripartite church, consisting with the belltower placed over the central part of the nave. This architectural combination in a belfry with two apse-like lower elements on each side. The original roof above the belfry's chapel was a stepped-hipped roof, which was popular at the time. After the fire of 1849, the roof's over the chapel and the cupola were modified from the original. After the Ukrainian SSR's decision on the demolition of the belfry in 1936, the belfry was destroyed a year later, to be used as bricks in construction projects."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Podil Raion"]},"\nThis is a historic neighbourhood and an administrative raion (district) in Kiev.

From small cafés that are only frequented by locals (they look dirty at first sight) to expensive places. Locals often buy drinks (beer) at a stall in the street and drink it in a park, leaving their bottles for the homeless to collect and cash in. However, since 2011, drinking beer in the street is prohibited and whilst you will see locals drinking in the street, you will make yourself an easy target for the police to stop and try for a bribe if you do. Locals often buy some chips or other salted things to go with their drinks.\n\nThe prices are quite reasonable by European standards.

Their main advantage is free WiFi, while on the downside are the prices that are rather high on Kiev standards.

Kiev is a generally open and friendly city and stays lively until at least 11PM in most districts.\n\nAvoid drinking the water from the tap — bottled water is cheap and available everywhere (Morshinska\/Моршинська, Mirgorodska\/Міргородська is good).\n\nIf you are female, and especially if you are traveling alone, try to take a taxi instead of public transit after 9PM These are prime drinking hours and the metro and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ukraine#Marshrutka"],["marshrutky"]]}," may be crowded with drunken men. This is particularly true on the weekends. Ask a local English-speaker to call the taxi for you and get the amount of the fare in advance; drivers may greatly inflate the fare once hearing your accent.\n\nRobberies and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["common scams"],["scams"]]}," on tourists are fairly common in Kiev. The best approach is to be extremely selfish and ignore anyone who approaches you. Avoid eye contact with suspicious looking people. If you do get caught up in a scam (such as the infamous wallet scam or the \"Look, I've just found money\" scam or even if you are stopped by someone claiming to be a policeman), simply ignore the person and walk away, indicate that you want to call your embassy or go to the next police station to get the problem sorted. That will usually shake the person off.\n\nIf you are leaving your baggage in the station, it is better to leave it with the guys in person rather than use a locker. Stories have been heard of people 'assisting' with the locker and overseeing the code, then walking off with the bag afterwards.\n\nOn the metro, ",{"type":"''","value":["always"]}," keep your belongings securely zipped as close to your skin as possible. Pickpockets are highly organised and often in gangs that know what they are doing.\n\nThere are occasional (rare) reports of visitors being shaken down by corrupt officials, often customs officials.  Naturally, the best protection is to make sure that you stay on the correct side of the law and, if there is any question, to keep your cool and not become argumentative. It seems that the cost of an error is surrendering the object in question and paying a \"fine.\"  The officials are skilled at ensuring that people who argue miss their flights.  Making, or giving the impression of making a phone call to your country's embassy has been known to clear up \"problems\" quicker than actually paying the \"fine\" --- or pretend to have a very late flight.\n\nWalking around in the tourist areas (e.g. Maydan) at night you will no doubt find yourself stopped by groups of police who will stop you and go through an overly theatrical display of asking to see your passport and other documents, and sometimes even search you for drugs or other prohibited items. To deal with this, firstly always carry your passport, not doing so will give them an easy excuse to extract a bribe. Secondly, making it clear that you speak absolutely no Russian may help. Lastly, don't given them any excuses whatsoever to threaten you with arrest - just because the locals drink in the street doesn't mean you should. Don't cross the road except at authorised points. Try and follow the rules.\n\nSome thieves like to abuse new tourists, for example, by playing plainclothes cop. They are rarely aggressive. They will go to you only if you're walking alone and don't look too familiar with the town. A bit of resisting usually shakes them off (but not too much since you never know).\n\nThere is still some corruption in Ukraine; some services might openly ask you to bribe them to process your request, and denying it might make them refuse to help you.\n\nThe people are very tolerant and it is only reasonable to assume that they expect the same in return.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Post Offices"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Main Post Office (Holovposhtamt)"],["alt=Головпоштамт, No.1 поштове відділення"],["url=http:\/\/www.kievcity.ukrposhta.com"],["email=ukrposhta@ukrposhta.com"],["address="],["lat=50.44973"],["long=30.52308"],["directions=M: Maidan Nezhalovsti"],["phone=+380 44 3232020"],["tollfree="],["fax=+380 44 2787969"],["hours=M-F 08.00-21.00, Sa 08.00-21.00, Su 09.00-19.00"],["price="],["content=Internet service with printing UAH8 per hour, UAH1 per A4.
