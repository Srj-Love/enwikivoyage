Kikinda has one of the two remaining such mills in Europe (the other being in Hungary). There were many mills like this in the town, the largest recorded number being 51 in 1847. The only remaining mill was built in 1899 and was operational until 1945.\n\nIt is located in the western part of town, on the corner of Nemanjina and Moravska streets. The plot of land is 728 square metres (7,840 sq ft). Suvača is a mill for grinding grain that uses the work of horses as its driving force. The mill uses one to five pairs of horses. One pair of horses was able to grind up to 100 kilograms (220 lb) of grain per hour. According to tradition, the taste of bread from wheat ground in Suvača was excellent and high quality. In addition to cereals, the mill at Suvača would process pepper and cinnamon.\n\nIn 1951 Suvača was placed under state protection, and in 1990 it was proclaimed an Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance and it is a \"must see unique historical attraction\".\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Churches"]},"\n\nLocated in the center of the square is Serbian Orthodox church built in 1769.

Ask for \"domestic coffee\" (often called also as \"Turkish coffee\" or \"Serbian coffee\").\n\nGo to open public market and buy (and try) some domestic agricultural products: watermelon, melon, apples, pears, tomatoes, peppers,strawberries... and many, many more. All is fresh, mostly organic and very tasty!\n\nFor recreation you can go to sport center \"Jezero\" (lake) where you can find several pools, tennis court, park suitable for jogging, or you can play football or basketball.\n\nIf you come in mid-October you are invited to visit The Pumpkin Days (Дани лудаје\/Dani ludaje in Serbian) - an annual manifestation. Every year people from all over the region gather in Kikinda to take part in a competition of who has the largest pumpkin and longest gourd. The term ludaja is specific to the Kikinda region, while the common Serbian word for pumpkin is bundeva. Kikinda has a special relationship with this plant because throughout its history, the locals used to say that one can stand on a pumpkin while working in the fields and get a clear view of the whole town. This exaggeration was supposed to depict the flatness of the town's territory. A local standing on a pumpkin, dressed in traditional attire, and with his hand blocking the sun so that he can see into the distance, thus became the symbol for the region. A group of local enthusiasts started the Pumpkin Days manifestation in 1986 and it quickly attracted pumpkin and gourd lovers from all over the country. The three-day event also includes lectures and seminars on the advancement of pumpkin and gourd cultivation, a culinary competition in preparing meals from pumpkins and gourds, children's competitions in creating masks and sculptures, and various concerts and exhibitions. Over the past few years this event has gained prominence and has drawn visitors from Hungary, Romania and the former Yugoslav republics. The largest pumpkin measured at the event to date weighed 247 kilograms, while the longest gourd was 213 centimeters in length. In 2006 the event celebrated its 20th anniversary and had the largest number of visitors so far, as well as a richer program. A tamburitza festival was included in the event, contributing to the authentic Banat experience.\n\nEvery year, since 1982, 6 to 8 world renowned sculptors are invited to Kikinda at the premises of an old production plant of the Toza Marković brick factory for an international symposium of sculpture \"Terra\".] The symposium lasts throughout the month of July. Over the years, \"Terra\" has hosted sculptors from all corners of the world who are drawn by the unique and peaceful ambience of the studio. All sculptures are done in terracotta and some have appeared at the Venice Biennale. Over 300 sculptors have so far participated in the symposium and have together produced more than 500 sculptures. Plans for the construction of a \"Terra\" museum are underway in which all the sculptures will be exhibited in a modern setting adjacent to the old studio. Sculptures made at \"Terra\" can be seen at town square also during whole year.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nAs a must, fast food is mandatory to try. Start with \"burek\" for breakfast (1€). Try first with cheese (that is a must), then try other.\n\nFor late afternoon or evening go for \"pljeskavica\" (burger, meat mixed with onion). Ask for the one filled with cheese - \"punjena pljeskavica\" (filled burger, less than 2€) or just try classic one (1.5€). Don't get surprised about size if you get used to eat burgers at world wide well known burger shops.\n\nFor full lunch or dinner experience go to one of local restaurants where you can ask for many local dishes. Banat is well know by rich and sometimes \"heavy\" meals, some of them are authentic, some came from neighboring countries. Domestic cabbage rolls (\"sarma\") are excellent. Baked beans (\"kuvani pasulj\") with sausages (\"kobasica\") and with briskets (\"rebarca\") are also recommended. Goulash (\"gulaš\") is Hungarian dish, but it is also well prepared here. There is also a really wide variety of other dishes.\n\nBut none of these does not give a full experience until you spend a day at one of farmers houses to taste really basic domestic food, wine and schnaps.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nAs a rule, at stores and restaurants it is hard to find quality drink. Only selected home made wine and schnaps are worth - and that is what really worth.
