Kilkenny. It's the smallest city in terms of population in the Republic of Ireland and the River Nore flows through the city splitting it in two with most sights of interest on the western side of this river.\n\nAs Ireland's Mediaeval Capital, it offers the traveller a mixture of an exciting vibrant night-life, beautiful street-scapes, great shopping opportunities and a rich cultural heritage.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nKilkenny (Irish: ",{"type":"''","value":["Cill Chainnigh"]},") is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Ireland as well as a weekend getaway for many Irish. Well regarded for its vibrant nightlife, it has become increasingly popular in recent years. The city is also famous for its many mediaeval buildings and is referred to as the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Marble City"]}," after the black polished limestone ['marble'] that was quarried around the city.\n\nDespite its small population, it holds ancient city status due to having a cathedral and an old royal charter dating from 1609. The locals do not take kindly to the city being referred to as a \"town\". In the mid 1960s various arts and craft enterprises were set up in what was the stables for Kilkenny Castle. These still exist in various forms and in the county - particularly in Thomastown.\n\nThe city plays host to three festivals which bring large crowds from all over Ireland. In May the Rhythm and Roots music festival take place in pubs and other venues around the city. On the June bank holiday weekend the Cat Laughs comedy festival take place. In August the Kilkenny Arts Festival, second only to its Galway equivalent, takes place. Venues for this last festival include the Castle and St Canice's Cathedral. The city centre is bookended by its two primary tourist attractions. St Canice's Cathedral to the north in Irishtown and Kilkenny Castle at the opposite end located on the Parade. The city has the greatest concentration of medieval churches in the country. Indeed on the occasion of the State purchasing St Mary's Hall Ireland's paper of record, The Irish Times, stated that \"St Mary's Hall in located halfway along the trail of the most significant medieval urban landscape in Ireland\". All year round the coaches which line the Parade underline the popularity of Kilkenny as a tourist destination.\n\nThe lower end of the Parade, from the Castle to the traffic lights at the beginning of High Street has recently been redesigned. It has created a pleasant pedestrian zone and also permits a nice vista of the Castle from High Street. It is currently the location of the only public toilets in the city. This new crude structure has had its appearance softened somewhat by the placing of tourist information boards across the front. These are well worth reading and will aid your enjoyment of our historic city. The tourist office, open all year round, is in Shee Alms House, on Rose Inn Street. This is five minutes walk from the Castle.\n\nAs a rule Kilkenny is a white collar city with one notable exception. Smithwicks which is still brewed at St Francis Brewery on Parliament Street. Glanbia formerly Avonmore, a giant in food production, has its administration headquarters on the edge of the city having being founded twelve miles away in Ballyraggett, Co. Kilkenny. The main venue for performing arts is the art deco Watergate Theatre located between Parliament Street and Irishtown. The predominant sport in Kilkenny is hurling. Hurling is one of two codes in the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA). Hurling is played with a wooden stick called a hurley. Using the hurley you hit a cork ball called a sliotar. Kilkenny as a county is the most successful team in terms of All-Ireland titles in the country. The local GAA stadium is Nowlan Park located ten minutes walk from the train station. The nickname for the team is the Cats. If Kilkenny are playing in the All-Ireland Final on the first Sunday of September, the city and county is decked out in the team colours of black and amber. It will be the talk of the town if they reach the Final. The Final is played in Croke Park, Dublin.\n\nAs a matter of curiosity, Kilkenny maybe the only place in Ireland with a street called The Parade. Only in Kilkenny and Dublin is there a Parliament Street.\n\nSightseeing, partying or a spot of shopping in Kilkenny's array of excellent shops, this city is certain to have it all for everyone.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Kilkenny Map.jpg"],["thumb"],["Kilkenny"]]},"\nKilkenny has a long and interesting history. The city's origins pre-date the medieval landmarks existing today. Saint Canice founded a monastic settlement in Kilkenny in the sixth century, unfortunately the sole remaining landmark from this settlement is the round tower positioned alongside the cathedral. Strongbow, the famous Norman Conqueror, then built a fortress in the City, ",{"type":"'''","value":["Kilkenny Castle"]},", and soon the construction of the walled city began.\n\nHowever, it wasn't until the seventeenth century that Kilkenny really entered its golden age. The parliament known as the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Confederation of Kilkenny"]}," was founded in 1641. This, also known as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Confederate Ireland"]},", refers to the period of Irish self-government between the Rebellion of 1641 and the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland in 1649. One of the parliament's main objectives was to unite resistance against English persecution of Irish Catholics. With the emergence of this parliament, Kilkenny entered a period of unparalleled success. Over time, however, the influence of the Confederation of Kilkenny diminished. Oliver Cromwell's arrival in Kilkenny heralded the dissolution of the parliament, and the city never quite regained the prosperity it had previously been celebrated for.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Plane"]},"\nThe only way to fly to Kilkenny is if you fly yourself and land on ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.kilkennyflying-glidingclub.com Kilkenny airfield"]},".

It is narrow lane connecting High Street with the parallel Kieran Street. In previous centuries butter used to be traded here. Continue along High Street until you come to the last slipway on your right. Turn down that lane and you will reach Kieran Street. In front of you will be Kyteler's Inn.

It is called Rothe House. It comprises three houses in the one complex. The restores gardens are accessed via the lane running alongside. Continuing along Parliament Street we reach St Francis Brewery where Smithwicks is produced. As the street slopes down we pass the Watergate theatre on your right. It is Kilkenny's stab at Art Deco. Further on you will see the ruins of St Francis Abbey on your right in the grounds of the brewery. Crossing the Bregagh river brings you into Irishtown. Irishtown was historically the poor end of town. However if you look up you will see the magnificent St Canice's Cathedral (CoI)with its round tower. It is accessed by climbing the steps just after the pedestrian crossing. There is a great view of the city from the tower. There is a roadway which runs parallel to the steps. If you come back down that path you will reach Dean Street. Take a right. Up ahead is the nice RC church of St Canice. Take a left before it and cross backover the Bregagh. Shortly on your left handside you will see Black Freren Gate, the only remaining gate of the city walls. On your right is the 12th century Black Abbey. The stain glass window in particular is magnificent. Leave the Abbey and take a right and then left onto Blackmill Street. Climb up the hill to reach St Mary's Cathedral (RC).

At the traffic lights continue straight ahead onto Rose Inn Street. You will reach Shee Alms House on your left handside. It has the tourist office symbol hanging outside. It is well worth a look inside. Return to the street and continue downhill over John's Bridge and take an immediate left. Walk along the quay and you will reach the main city Library house in a quaint stone structure from the turn of the last century. Return up the quay and halfway over the bridge stop and admire the best view of Kilkenny Castle. At the end of the bridge take a left into Canal Square. Note the lovely gate lodge on the left.
