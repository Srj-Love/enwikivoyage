However, rates into Killeen's airport are often higher than rates into Austin's Bergstrom International Airport, which is only an hour and a half to the south of Killeen.  Check both rates before booking a flight.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nIn recent years, Killeen has become increasingly easy to get around without a car, thanks to the municipal bus service provided by \"The HOP.\"  HOP stops are located throughout the city, some of which are only a few blocks apart.  To find out the HOP schedule from a particular stop, call (254) 616-6800.  The buses usually stop running before it gets dark.  With a car, Killeen can be difficult to navigate, due to the irregular street pattern that exists outside of downtown.  A map of the city (which can be purchased at Wal-Mart or at local convenience stores) can be very helpful.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Fort Hood"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Unfortunately, Killeen is somewhat lacking in tourist attractions.  However, there are a few things to see and do around town, if for some reason you should find yourself here visiting family or for whatever other reason.  Fort Hood, the largest military base in the world, borders the northern and western edges of town.  If you can get on base (you must be with or related to a military personnel or civil service worker), there is a good Cavalry Museum to see, and you can drive down Battalion Avenue, which is lined with barracks and Army buildings, to get a glipse of life on a military reservation.  Since most of Killeen dates from the 1940's or later, there are not many historic buildings.  There is, however, a nice little chapel dating from 1882 (Bethel Primitive Baptist Church), that offers scheduled tours, and there are a number of turn-of-the-century buildings and small shops lining North 2nd Street in the downtown area."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nWith not mcuh else to do, Killeen does offer plenty of shopping.  The Killeen Mall has over 100 stores but has become somewhat run-down in recent years.  The Market Heights shopping area, in Harker Heights (a suburb bordering Killeeen on the east) is the area's newest and most upscale shopping venue, boasting a Barnes & Noble's Bookstore, Target, a large Cineplex movie theater, high-end spirits shop, a few clothing stores, and a number of restaurants.
