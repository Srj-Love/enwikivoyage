Bus 125 runs from Valley Forge National Historical Park and the King of Prussia directly into the Center City Philadelphia. You can catch it along Gulph Road and at the King of Prussia Mall transit center. You will arrive near the train station at 30th St and Market St; from there, you walk a few feet to the station itself and get on the eastbound subway towards the Old City and other attractions.

The buses run every 20 min during peak hours and every hour off-peak, during the weekdays, and the trip takes around 40 min. While taking a bus may seem inconvenient, you will save time and hassle by not driving into Philadelphia yourself. Relax and let the bus driver fight the traffic. You will save even more time and money since you don't have to find a place to park your car in the city. In the reverse direction, the last bus leaves Philly (again at 30th and Market) at about 10PM, on weekdays. The 124 and 125 buses also run on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nThere are several bus routes that connect King of Prussia with nearby suburbs. Bus 92 connects the King of Prussia Mall with West Chester and Exton in Chester County Monday through Saturday.

Few places evoke the spirit of patriotism and independence, represent individual and collective sacrifice, or demonstrate the resolve, tenacity and determination of the people of the United States to be free as does Valley Forge. The historic landscapes, structures, objects, and archeological and natural resources at Valley Forge are tangible links to one of the most defining events in our nation's history.

It was here that General George Washington forged his Continental Army into a fighting force, during the difficult winter encampment of 1777-78. Of all places associated with America's War for Independence, none conveys the suffering, sacrifice and ultimate triumph more than Valley Forge. No battles were fought, no bayonet charges or artillery bombardments took place. Nonetheless, some 2,000 soldiers died - more Americans than were killed at the battles of Brandywine and Germantown combined. Valley Forge is the story of an army's epic struggle to survive against terrible odds, hunger, disease and the unrelenting forces of nature. Today, the park is a lush, 3,600-acre expanse of rolling hillsides dotted with flowering dogwood trees. Washington's original stone headquarters has been restored and furnished; log huts have been reconstructed; and statues and monuments throughout the park remind visitors of our national heritage. Among them are statues of General \"Mad Anthony\" Wayne and Baron Friedrich von Steuben; and the Monument to Patriots of African Descent. Stop at the Visitors Center at the junction of Rt 23 and N.
