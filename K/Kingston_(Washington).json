He moved in along with 10 oxen and 10 men. They slowly logged the hills around Appletree Cove. Mr. King built many small buildings and shacks along the shore for his men and animals. In 1882, the trees were gone and King moved on. The shacks and bunkhouses were left behind and lived in by drifters, squatters and old loggers. People living in the area often referred to this as ",{"type":"'''","value":["King's Town"]},", probably as a joke. The name slowly evolved in to Kingston and stuck.\n\nThe Kingston townsite was platted on April 24, 1890 by C.C. Calkins and Samuel B. Brierly. Calkins dreamed of Kingston as a resort town for vacationers from Seattle. Calkins called it The Monterey of Washington. Calkins had drawings and designs for a giant hotel on the waterfront, with a boat launch, a church on the hill, along with a college. After Calkins and Brierly platted the town, a lower than expected number of people showed up to settle there. Calkins then gave up and left. The town slowly grew, but not at the pace that Calkins had dreamed and it eventually became the quaint harbor town we know today.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nFrom ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Port Angeles"]]},", Olympic Peninsula Points: Drive EAST on U.S. 101 to State Route (SR) 104, crossing the Hood Canal Floating Bridge.
