They are symbolically important, and arguably strategically as well, and were often actively fought over from 1949 into the 1970s. The \"Artillery Battle of 823\" was one of the key battles that kept the PRC from invading Taiwan. It involved artillery bombardment of Kinmen and Matsu, beginning on August 23 (8-23) 1958.\n\nIn recent decades relations between the two governments have improved greatly; there is extensive Taiwan investment in China and travel in either direction is much easier than it used to be. However, Kinmen and Matsu remain sensitive areas and both the PRC and the ROC maintain substantial military forces in the area.
