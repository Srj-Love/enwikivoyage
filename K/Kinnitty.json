The village is situated in a picturesque setting at the foot of the Slieve Bloom Mountains. Like any typical Irish village it has two pubs (Slieve Bloom Bar & Clendennen's), two churches, a post office and some shops. However unlike any Irish village it has a pyramid which was built by the Bernard family who resided in Kinnitty Castle, which they built on the site of St. Finnians monastery, the high cross of which is still situated on the site. The pyramid can be seen by entering the grounds of the Church of Ireland, and following the walkway in the back.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nFrom ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tullamore"]]}," or from the Slieve Bloom Mountains\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nWalk or Cycle\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Kinnity Castle"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Kinnitty Castle is a castle in Kinnitty, County Offaly, Ireland.
