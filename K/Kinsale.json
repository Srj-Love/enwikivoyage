The battle was in 1601 and was fought when an Irish army had travelled from the north of Ireland to relieve an English siege on the town that was held by the Spanish. Against the odds the Irish lost the battle, and this defeat marked the end of the ancient Gaelic aristocracy in Ireland.\nIn addition to its visual charms, the town has become a home of good food, especially seafood, and holds an annual festival to celebrate.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nIf you have not already rented a car for your trip, the easiest way to get to Kinsale is via taxi, or by bus.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nTaxis await in a line (\"queue\") just outside the front entrance to the terminal at Cork Airport, and are always present.
