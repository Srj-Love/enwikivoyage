They have improved things and it is quite manageable. Just follow everyone else and try not to look like a tourist! A yellow fever vaccination certificate is essential. Watch out for being mobbed by volunteer 'helpers' once you are outside the airport, who will want to carry your bags in return for tips. Keep in mind that when returning to the airport to leave you can not drive your car or take a cab onto the airport property without paying for parking \/ access $5 or $10.\n\nA taxi into town will probably cost you $30-$50 (usually without air conditioning!). It is an hour's drive into the centre of Kinshasa.

There are speed boats that go quickly for a limited number of people, or you can take the barge with local merchants if you have time.  Ask to go to \"the Beach\", which is the ferry terminal.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nOfficially there is a city bus and it has been bolstered recently by some older buses from Belgium being gifted to Kinshasa to improve the routes.  This system pales in comparison to the \"taxi\" system that has risen organically to serve the needs of the people of Kinshasa.\n\nEssentially, these taxis are small buses.  They run set routes between embarkation points that are the \"stops\".  The cost between these various points is usually around 350 Francs.  If one's destination is through multiple points, different taxis will need to be boarded to complete the route, making the system take a good deal of time during busy traffic hours.\n\nPeople waiting at the stops will move their hands in a variety of gestures to signal which direction they are going.  A taxi will then stop and pick up someone if they are going in the same direction and have space in the taxi.\n\nThis system works well for the locals.  For visitors and foreigners, it can be quite difficult as one needs to know the hand signs, have knowledge of the routes, be ready to sit in cramped, hot vehicles with many other people, and deal with the potential dangers of these vehicles as many are barely road-worthy.  Traveling through this manner absolutely requires local help for those unfamiliar with the system.  One will also have to speak French or Lingala as the drivers do not speak English.\n\nThere are also traditional taxis for hire.  They are available for single runs or can be hired by the day.  This can be a tricky business and should be handled with care (especially at the airport) as there are those will take people to remote locations and rob them.  Again, help from a local is best or using drivers that others in the area have past experience with and trust.  Rates for these taxis vary widely and if one does not appear to be of African descent, there will also be an automatic premium added.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Lr new best bonobo pics20.jpg"],["thumb"],["Lola ya Bonobo (\"Paradise for Bonobos\") is the world's only sanctuary for orphaned bonobos."]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=National Museum of Kinshasa"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat=-4.321146"],["long=15.293437"],["directions="],["phone=+243 12 61494"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Founded in 1970, hosts a large selection of ethnographic objects."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Lola ya Bonobo"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.lolayabonobo.org"],["email="],["address="],["lat=-4.489766"],["long=15.268443"],["directions="],["phone=+243 818 141492"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=the world's only sanctuary for orphaned bonobos.

Bottled water seems to be cheap enough but sometimes hard to find for a good price. The best way is if you are staying in an upscale hotel that provides it with the room just tip the housekeeping staff to get extra bottles put in your room (usually if you tell them while giving them the money that works the best, and after the first 2 days of asking for the water you usually don't have to worry about telling them anymore, just give them the $5 a day).\n\nMake sure you have all required vaccinations -  i.e. yellow fever, typhoid, etc.\n\nMosquitoes can be a problem in the entire city. Malaria medication should be taken.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nIt is highly recommended that you have someone with you at all times that is a local (besides while being in your hotel). Cab drivers will usually stay with you too when going to local shops and making quick stops and will serve as your translator if you get a good one. Be careful with any equipment you have with you such as digital cameras and video equipment. Be careful also of what you take pictures of. Even if they say no photos only at the airport and of government buildings, a lot of times the police and UN people will get upset if you are taking videos at other places where technically it is supposed to be ok to do. Just be sure to have plenty of locals with you that know what they are doing and can provide security and a way out if you get stuck or in trouble. Follow their advice and pay attention when out and about. When in doubt about taking a photo of something don't until you get very clear instructions that it is ok. Don't keep cameras in open view unless you've been cleared to take a photo (which is just like taking a photo to them it seems). Also be equally prepared for hostility and positive reactions when taking photos.\n\nWhen traveling by car, always lock all the doors before you set off, as it is not uncommon for opportunist thieves to try to open them and snatch belongings. For the same reason, keep bags and valuables out of reach and out of sight. \n\nIf you are approached by people claiming to be police, be wary. If they are not in uniform, they are probably not police but are most likely hoping to relieve you of your money and valuables. A common tactic is for a group of men in a car to show a fake police identity card and ask you to go with them to the police station. Do not get in the car; just walk away. Be prepared to run. Never lose your temper, but keep negotiating in a friendly way; in the end, they will give up.\n\nRecent road scams have included a group of fake police officers in an unmarked 4x4 vehicle that will pull over unsuspecting people driving alone in cars, then forcibly take them in to their vehicle, drive them out to the country, rob them of everything and leave them stranded.  While the main targets have been UN staff in obvious white UN vehicles, all foreigners driving should be wary of this group or others operating like them. For general safety, people should never drive alone in vehicles, especially after dark.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n\nBBC World Service radio broadcast in English, French and Swahili in Kinshasa on 92.6MHz.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\nIf departing from Kinshasa's N'djili International Airport, a fee of $50.00 (USD) must be paid (a receipt is issued) before entering the terminal.

Be advised that announcements are not always made in a timely manner about flight departures or arrivals.  In previous years visitors to the upstairs lounge could stand overlooking the tarmac but security concerns have increased the distance between the open air viewing and the lounge itself.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usablecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["-4.325000"],["15.322222"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Western DRC"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Kinshasa"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Kinshasa"]]}]
