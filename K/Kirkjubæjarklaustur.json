With a population of around 160, it is the closest thing to an urban area within a vast municipality called Skaftárhreppur, and it's the only proper service centre on the almost 300km stretch of the ring road between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vík"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Höfn"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nKirkjubæjarklaustur is named after an convent which stood there in Catholic times. Many of the local toponyms are related to nuns, usually referring to sisters, or to the convent itself (klaustur, in Icelandic). In recent centuries, the region has been shaped by catastrophic geological events, including the eruption in nearby Lakagígar (also known as Laki) in 1783-1784 which killed around 25% of the Icelandic population. In more recent years, eruptions under Vatnajökull glacier and the resulting floods have also played a role. However, all this activity also means that the landscape is stunning and often extreme in its beauty and the immediate vicinity of the village is a prosperous agricultural area. \n\nOrienting yourself in Kirkjubæjarklaustur is very simple. Klausturvegur is the road that runs through most of the village, with smaller streets branching out from it.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nMost visitors to Kirkjubæjarklaustur will arrive via the ring road.

The local church is interesting for its modern architecture and to learn about the history of the 18th century priest Jón Steingrímsson who, according to legend, saved the area from devestation in the massive Skaftáreldar eruption of 1783. The graceful waterfall Systrafoss (",{"type":"''","value":["Sister falls"]},") overlooks the village, flowing from a lake on top of the small mountain.
