It is an industrial and cultural center of Kirovohrad Oblast. Kirovohrad is located on the Dnieper Upland, on the banks of river Inhul. It is a motorway junction. There is a train station (Znamyanka - Pomoshnaya line) and a civilian airport.  Kirovohrad is not famous for its places of interest, but the downtown still bears the remnants of old architecture. Some of the old buildings are renovated and some are still in the process of renovation. A lot of things still remind of country's Soviet past - many streets still are named after Soviet activists; Lenin busts and statues are a common sight. In recent years the city administration is doing a good job of making Kirovohrad a better place both for locals and tourists.
