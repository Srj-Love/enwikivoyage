Kirzhach does not fall into the list of the basic attractions of the region. Still, the town has its own charm and deserves a short stroll if you pass by.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Geography"]},"\nThe town is located on the banks of the river Kirzhach, the left tributary of the Klyazma. Kirzhach is mainly surrounded by forests with few fields and hills. The town stands on the circular railway line that runs around ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]}," (Big ring of Moscow railway). The respective circular road A108 is found 10 km to the west, while the radial road from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]}," passes through the town and heads east towards ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kol'chugino"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yuryev-Polsky"]]},". The population of Kirzhach is 32 thousand (2006).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nKirzhach is known since 14th century. Several documents by the Moscow prince Ivan Kalita mention a village on the Kirzhach river and date the town back to around 1330. Yet a more definite identification refers to the foundation date of the Kirzhach monastery (later, a convent). The monastery was established by the spiritual leader Sergius of Radonezh at 1354–1358. Initally, the monastery was a skete (an isolated side settlement) of the Trinity lavra of St. Sergius in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sergiev Posad"]]},", while the settlement was considered as a village-at-the-monastery (not a town). The advantageous location on the ",{"type":"''","value":["Stromyn way"]}," (Стромынский тракт), the road between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]}," and the towns around ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vladimir"]]}," (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Suzdal"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yuryev-Polsky"]]},"), led to the rapid growth of the settlement. Since 1781, Kirzhach was considered a town. The old Stromyn road gradually diminished, but the new connection, the circular railway line around Moscow, appeared as early as 1900. The presence of the railroad caused the development of industry in Kirzhach. Originally, textile production prevalied, but in 20th century other industry appeared (production of engineering tools, car lights, etc.) Still, most of the factories are located in the suburbs, and Kirzhach does not look like a heavy industrialized town.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Orientation"]},"\nThe Kirzhach river flows from north to south and divides the town into two parts. The historical center and the convent are located in the eastern part, close to the river. The western part of the town looks more like a village. Still, the church of St. Nicholas (one of the main sights of Kirzhach), the train station, and the bus station are located in the western part, away from the town center. The railway runs along the western boundary of Kirzhach. The road to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]}," leaves the town in the western direction, the road to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alexandrov"]]}," goes north, the roads to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vladimir"]]}," run towards the M7 highway, both south and east. Main streets in the historical center are parallel, ",{"type":"'''","value":["улица Гагарина"]}," (ulitsa Gagarina) and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ленинградская улица"]}," (Leningradskaya ulitsa). The former street leads to the bridge over the river and is continued by ",{"type":"'''","value":["Большая Московская улица"]}," (Bol'shaya Moskovskaya ulitsa), while the latter one heads east and turns into the road to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kol'chugino"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yuryev-Polsky"]]},". On the eastern bank, the town extends to the south, far beyond the historical center. These districts are mainly industrial and are of little interest for the traveller.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nThe train station is located on the western boundary of the town, in the very end of ",{"type":"''","value":["Большая Московская улица"]},". The station is pretty small and serves local trains only. These trains typically run 6–8 times per day between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alexandrov"]]}," (the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]}," – ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yaroslavl"]]}," railroad) and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Orehovo-Zuevo"]]}," (the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]}," – ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vladimir"]]}," railroad).
