The city is found at the furthest navigable point on the Congo River upstream of Kinshasa\/Brazzaville at the end of the Boyoma Falls, a series of cataracts along a 100 km stretch of the river. The city's name comes from Swahili for \"the city on the island\" due to the number of tributaries in the area that almost completely separate Kisangani into a collection of islets.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Fishing at the falls - Julien Harneis - February 28, 2007 - 1.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Fishing with conical 'nets' at Boyoma Falls."]]},"\n\nThe city was founded in 1883 as a colonial outpost and trading centre by Henry Morton Stanley. It was named Stanley Falls Station (or Stanleyville) and was located at the furthest navigable point up the Congo River from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kinshasa"]]}," (then ",{"type":"''","value":["Leopoldville"]},"). It was initially successful, but East African slavers soon arrived (erroneously called \"Arabs\", but actually from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zanzibar"]]},") and after minor conflict, the city was abandoned in 1887. After negotiations with the 'Arabs', the Belgians were given limited control of the Eastern Congo under authority of the notorious Zanzibar slaver\/ruler Tippu Tip. By the late 1890s, the region was once again firmly under the control of the Belgians and Stanleyville was the capital of the prosperous Eastern Province of Belgian Congo.\n\nIn 1958, the city was a stronghold of Patrice Lumumba's independence movement. After his assassination in 1961, Antoine Gizenga set up a government in Kisangani to compete with the national government in Leopoldville. Stanleyville served as the capital of the independent, secessionist state \"Republic of Congo\" set up by the Simba rebels. When the rebels began to feel their movement was destined to defeat, they began taking hostage all white persons in the region they controlled. Over 1800 Europeans & Americans were held hostage at the Victoria Hotel in Stanleyville for 111 days. Belgian, U.S., and Congolese paratroopers landed at the airport one night, stormed the hotel (with only 60 hostages killed), secured the airfield for evacuation flights to land, and managed to airlift 1800 hostages & 400 Congolese to safety over the course of two days. The airlift coincided with the arrival of pro-Leopoldville mercenary fighters who soon managed to quash the Simba rebellion. The city would also see two unsuccessful mutinies in 1966 & 1967 where gendarmes loyal to ousted politician Tshombe (exiled to Spain) rioted and mutinied against Congolese troops, amid rumours that Tshombe was plotting a return to power in the Congo.\n\nIn 1998, the city became a forward base for rebel leader Laurent Kabila and his foreign mercenaries (over 30,000 Ugandan, Rwandan, & Burundian soldiers) on their march to Kinshasa to overthrow Mobutu. However, fighting between Hutu & Tutsi mercenaries spread to the local population (opposed to the presence of foreign mercenaries), resulting in some bloodshed. In 1999, the city saw the first open fighting between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Uganda"]]},"n and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rwanda"]]},"n soldiers in the Second Congo War, resulting in 3000 civilian deaths in the city. Soon after, a prolonged battle between Ugandan and Rwandan forces resulted in the destruction of about one quarter of the city, resulting in thousands of deaths. Yet another fight, in June 2000, left thousands more dead in the city. When the Second Congo War ended, Kisangani was under the control of Rwanda-backed Rally for Congolese Democracy - Goma.\n\nToday the city is a quiet commercial centre in the middle of the jungle. Despite a population of 1.2 million, Kisangani's isolation results in limited opportunities for economic growth and for a city its size, there's not much to see or do. The city is exceptionally diverse with over 250 cultures represented and no one, single ethnicity or place of origin dominating the city's cultural identity.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh =   31"],["febhigh =   31"],["marhigh =   31"],["aprhigh =   31"],["mayhigh =   31"],["junhigh =   30"],["julhigh =   29"],["aughigh =   28"],["sephigh =   29"],["octhigh =   30"],["novhigh =   29"],["dechigh =   30"],["janlow =   21"],["feblow =   21"],["marlow =   21"],["aprlow =   21"],["maylow =   21"],["junlow =   21"],["jullow =   19"],["auglow =   20"],["seplow =   20"],["octlow =   20"],["novlow =   20"],["declow =   20"],["janprecip = 53"],["febprecip = 84"],["marprecip = 178"],["aprprecip = 158"],["mayprecip = 137"],["junprecip = 114"],["julprecip = 132"],["augprecip = 165"],["sepprecip = 183"],["octprecip = 218"],["novprecip = 198"],["decprecip = 84"]]}," \n\nBeing very near the equator and in the middle of the jungle, you might suspect the city has a wet, tropical climate...and it does!

There are irregular ferry services running between Kisangani and Kinshasa which take about 2-3 weeks. Most of these are old barges tied together and crowded with people riding atop cargo, although a few steamer vessels run this route too. Overcrowded ferries are common and there have been a few instances of them capsizing, so choose carefully. If you are lucky, you can negotiate with the captain for a private room (literally) or a bedroom. Many of these ferries are supplied with food from people who bring boats from shore full of goods to trade\/barter. A unique and classic trip, it's only for the hearty, experienced traveller (although still preferable to travelling overland).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Overland"]},"\nKisangani is difficult to reach by road. The only relatively \"easy\" route into the city is the newly rehabilitated National Route 4 which runs to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bukavu"]]}," and the Rwandan border. Much of the road is sealed, but slow-moving trucks and pedestrians & people on bikes keep the speed of vehicles down. You should expect to encounter a handful of military\/police checkpoints where you will likely be harassed for a bribe. The route isn't terribly safe, with frequent reports of bandits setting up roadblocks and robbing motorists. Additionally, safety in North\/South Kivu is still shaky. You are best off traveling with a trucker or other local vehicle. If traveling in your own vehicle (especially a non-DRC vehicle), try to travel with a local or convoy for safety and to avoid excessive harassment at checkpoints.\n\nOther roads in\/out of the city are mostly muddy tracks only suitable for large 4x4 or 6x6 trucks. However, road repairs are a high priority in the region and many roads are being groomed or repaired. Ask for advice from locals about the condition of roads in the region.

If you need to travel across the town (or to the airport), you should make arrangements for vehicle hire a day or two in advance! For rides to the airport, expect to pay USD20-40.
