Both the beach and the village share a feeling that development remains on a human scale and in harmony with nature. It is a pattern and character of development that the Town's people, both year-round and seasonal, are quite comfortable with and want to retain.\n\nWhen Orville Wright stepped ashore in Kitty Hawk Village in the fall of 1900, he probably already knew that he and his brother were destined to make history as discoverers of flight. After all, they had chosen this remote fishing village on the Outer Banks partly for privacy from prying eyes.\n\nThree years later, they would indeed break the bonds of earth for the first time in their heavier than air flying machine. From that moment forward, Kitty Hawk would forever be associated with the Wright Brothers as the birthplace of aviation -although the actual flight took place four miles south from the base of Kill Devil Hill. \n\nToday, the once-tiny soundside village is one of the largest townships on the Outer Banks. On the oceanside, thousands of rental homes, restaurants and shops are part of the development that has characterized the northern Outer Banks from Nags Head to Corolla. \n\nBut along the Albemarle Sound, the village remains a treat for those who to choose to take a drive off the beaten path. Shaded lanes wind along the marshes. Quaint clapboard cottages and fishing boats line a series of canals that lead to the open waters of the Sound. And life takes on a more leisurely pace that is reminiscent of the way Outer Bankers used to live.\n\nIn 1903, Orville Wright telegraphed home the triumphant news of the first powered flight. The telegraph was dispatched from Kitty Hawk. This, along with the isolation of the area and the unusual names themselves, led to the subsequent confusion as to where the first flight actually occurred.\n\nWright Brothers National Memorial and Visitor Center and the Memorial Pylon are nearby reminders of the days when Orville and Wilbur Wright made this area their headquarters.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nThe Norfolk International Airport is only 1 hour and 30 minutes away.
