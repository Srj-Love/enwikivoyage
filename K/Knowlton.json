The Auberge, located at the corner of Lakeside and Knowlton Roads, in the heart of the community, advertises that the building has been an inn for 150 years. Present owners, Michel Gabereau and Signy Stephenson have done a great job of sympathetically renovating the heritage structure. Itâ€™s such a pleasure to stay in a room that has windows that actually open! Their on-site Restaurant-Bistro, Le Relais, specializes in local cuisine. Patrons rarely stop at one basket of warm crusty baguette with creamy Eastern Townships butter and their soups are excellent.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Eastern Townships"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Brome Lake, Quebec"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["45.2167"],["-72.5167"]]}]
