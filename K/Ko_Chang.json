With about 5,000 permanent residents the island is not heavily populated, but tourism (and development) has increased dramatically over the past few years.\n\nKo Chang is one of Thailand's most beautiful islands with long white sandy beaches, most half-deserted. The island is also home to a wide range of wildlife, including a good selection of birds, snakes, deer, and a number of elephants. The island and its vicinity are great places for snorkelling, diving, and jungle hiking. The \"discovery\" of the island as a tourist destination since 2000 has brought on a large amount of rapid development, and while still far quieter than places like Phuket or Ko Samui, it's probably better to go now than later. Regarding services and activities specifically aimed at tourists prices have reached such a level that the islanders are pricing themselves out of the market when compared to the other islands.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nPrior to World War II, Ko Chang was little known by anyone. During this period, the few families there made a living growing coconuts and fruit on the mainland. In January 1941, during the Japanese occupation, the Thai Navy fought the French in a battle in the waters to the southeast of Ko Chang.\n\nNothing else happened to Ko Chang until the first backpacker foreigners started arriving on the back of local fishing boats in the mid-1970s. In 1982, Ko Chang along with surrounding area became part of the protected Mu Ko Chang National Marine Park. Only very recently, in less than ten years, Ko Chang has turned itself into a major tourist destination, both for foreigners and local Thais.\n\nThis sudden tourism boom however, has been fraught with controversy concerning land encroachment.  The government is trying to \"develop\" it from a backpackers' paradise to a top-level destination, and construction work is going on throughout the island, with basic huts torn down to make way for fancy resorts.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Geography"]},"\nKo Chang is the largest island in the Ko Chang Archipelago. The name means ",{"type":"'''","value":["Elephant Island"]},", named for the elephant shape of its headland, although elephants are not indigenous to the island.\n\nKo Chang has an area of approximately 429 square kilometres. The topography contains high mountains and complex stone cliffs. The highest peak is Khao Salak Phet which is 744 m high, rich in fertile evergreen forest which is the main water source. Therefore, there are many waterfalls, beaches, and splendid reefs in the west of the island.\n\nMost accommodation is on the west side of the island, where the sandy beaches are. On the east side there are no sandy beaches and it is far less touristy. There are some nice waterfalls though.\n\n70 per cent of this undisturbed island is rain forest, steep hills, cliffs, waterfalls, and wildlife, fine beaches, coral reefs and an abundance of marine life. The island also offers tall mountains and rock cliffs.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Climate "]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh =  31"],["febhigh =  32"],["marhigh =  33"],["aprhigh =  35"],["mayhigh =  33"],["junhigh =  32"],["julhigh =  32"],["aughigh =  32"],["sephigh =  31"],["octhigh =  30"],["novhigh =  30"],["dechigh =  30"],["janlow =  20"],["feblow =  22"],["marlow =  24"],["aprlow =  25"],["maylow =  25"],["junlow =  24"],["jullow =  24"],["auglow =  24"],["seplow =  24"],["octlow =  24"],["novlow =  22"],["declow =  25"],["janprecip = 39"],["febprecip = 43"],["marprecip = 99"],["aprprecip = 112"],["mayprecip = 365"],["junprecip = 418"],["julprecip = 439"],["augprecip = 490"],["sepprecip = 502"],["octprecip = 274"],["novprecip = 54"],["decprecip = 2"],["jansun ="],["febsun ="],["marsun ="],["aprsun ="],["maysun ="],["junsun ="],["julsun ="],["augsun ="],["sepsun ="],["octsun ="],["novsun ="],["decsun ="],["janh2o ="],["febh2o ="],["marh2o ="],["aprh2o ="],["mayh2o ="],["junh2o ="],["julh2o ="],["augh2o ="],["seph2o ="],["octh2o ="],["novh2o ="],["dech2o ="],["description ="]]},"\n\nKo Chang has the same seasons as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bangkok"]]},".

The rates are generally much higher than in other places, but the vehicles are almost new and in excellent condition. Starting from 17:00, many of them start to ask \"taxi\" price, telling you that they operate as a public transport only until that time, and may quote prices as high as say 500 baht from Lonely Beach to the Dan Kao pier (bargain if you choose to hire, do not support silly prices!). However, if you have some time and patience, you still can try and have a \"shared\" ride with some drivers, maybe for a higher rate if they expect little or no other passengers.\n\nThese taxis are also waiting at the Dan Kao Pier (50 baht\/person to White Sand Beach, 100 baht to Lonely Beach). At the Dan Kao Ferry-Pier there may be no taxis available. If you arrive without a vehicle you may have to walk the 400 m to Dan Kao Pier.\n\nSmall motorcycles can be hired for 150-250 baht per day. The main road is sealed and almost circles the island and there are plans to complete the circuit in the near future. Cars are also available for rent, most hotels can help with it. 4 x 4 recommended, since some roads might be in bad condition, especially near Lonely Beach.\n\nIf there are 2 or more persons going with you, hiring a songthaew may cost the same price, or even be cheaper than paying per each person in a \"shared\" songthaew (there is no difference, an empty songthaew can easily be hired). Just do not forget to bargain if their price sounds quite silly when compared, say, to Bangkok taxi-meter (on Ko Chang it can be difficult if not impossible to get the same price, but at least it should not cost double or even more). Most folk however, just stay put on the beach of their choice and walk to wherever they want to go.\n\nHitching on Ko Chang is also an alternative if you choose not to pay the often exorbitant fees of the songthaew. Many islanders are more than willing to pick up a hitchhiker who happens to be going the same way they are. A Coke or cold bottle of green tea for the driver are always appreciated at the end of your journey.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" See "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Mu Ko Chang National Park"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=National Marine Park including parts of Ko Chang and 46 other islands."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=War Memorial Monument"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=In the very S of the island"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Beaches"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Kai Bae Beach"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat=12.0289"],["long=102.2901"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Khlong Prao Beach"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat=12.0548"],["long=102.2899"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Lonely Beach"],["alt=Hat Tha Nam, Ao Bai Lan"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat=12.0037"],["long=102.2942"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=White Sand Beach"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat=12.1075"],["long=102.2708"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Waterfalls"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Khiri Petch"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=About 3 km from Salak Petch village"],["phone="],["fax="],["hours="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["price="],["content=Medium sized waterfall."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Klong Nonsi"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat=12.08471"],["long=102.34897"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Waterfall on the east side of the island.
