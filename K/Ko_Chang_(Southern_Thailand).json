Compared with the better known islands of Thailand, (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Phuket"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ko Samui"]]},"), this one is very quiet and special due to its beautiful dark sandy beaches, interesting nature (birds), and rocks. The water is not clear and the sand is not white, but the place is so special that it does not matter. There are some quiet resorts on the island, most of them basic.
