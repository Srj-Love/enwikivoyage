Shady trees hang over the sand. About 100 m from shore on Long Beach and about 50 m at Banana Beach there are vast staghorn coral reefs. \n\nVisibility is excellent most days. The afternoons are particularly good. There are buoyed areas to keep the boats from the swimmers so it is very safe, no injuries in over 25 years of visitors. Caution is advised for those swimming and snorkelling in the waters further from shore. There is heavy boat traffic all day. \n\nCoral Island Club provides daily trips to Banana Beach and overnight camping. Activities include swimming, snorkeling, power snorkelling, diving, parasailing, banana boats, kayaking, fish feeding, hornbill feeding, BBQs, and camping.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Coral Island Resort"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.coralislandresort.com"],["email=resv@coralislandresort.com"],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Take a speedboat from Chalong Bay"],["phone=+66 76 281060-2"],["tollfree="],["fax=+66 76 381957"],["checkin=14:00"],["checkout=12:00"],["price=Low season, 1,800-3,000 baht; high season, 2,800-3,600 baht; peak season, 3,700-4,900 baht"],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Southeast Coast (Phuket)"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["no Wikipedia link"]]}]
