[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Mena-asia_default_banner.jpg"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Ko Kret"]}," (also ",{"type":"''","value":["Koh Kred"]},") is an island in the Chao Phraya River, 20 km north of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bangkok"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Thailand"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Understand "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Village1 House.JPG"],["thumb"],["400px"],["A simple house in Village 1"]]},"\nThe island dates only to 1722, when a canal was constructed as a shortcut to bypass a bend in the Om Kret branch of the Chao Phraya river. As the canal was widened several times, the section cut off eventually became a separate island. The island continues to serve as a refuge to the Mon tribes who dominated central Thailand between the 6th and 10th centuries and have retained a distinct identity in their flavour of Buddhism and, particularly at Ko Kret, their pottery.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\n\nThe easiest way to reach Ko Kret is to take the once-weekly Chao Phraya Express, which leaves the Central Pier (BTS Saphan Taksin) every Sunday at 09:00 and visits a number of attractions before returning at 15:30. The cost of the cruise and guided tour is 300 baht (no lunch). Many other companies also offer similar tours, often just as a stop on a longer upriver trip to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ayutthaya"]]},".\n\nIndependent travel to Ko Kret is a little more challenging. The easiest option is to take public bus 166 from Victory Monument (at the footbridge's end) or bus 505 from Central World to the end of the line in the Pak Kret market. From there, you have to walk about 500 m (or take a motorbike taxi\/samlor) towards the river to the ferry pier, which is located behind Wat Sanam Neua.\n\nMore fun, though, is to arrive by boat. If you're willing to get up at the crack of dawn, the Chao Phraya \"green flag\" express boat offers a direct service from BTS Saphan Taksin to Pak Kret (Pier N33), but during peak hours only. Boats run every 15-20 min in both directions from 06:15-08:00, and again from 15:30-18:00, with no service on Sundays.  The trip costs 20 baht and takes just over an hour.\n\nOutside peak hours, the closest you can get is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nonthaburi"]]}," pier, the last stop (Pier N30) of the normal Chao Phraya Express Boat. From here, the options are:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Take the air-con van service (just 10 baht) or public bus 32 to Pak Kret, then head to the ferry pier serving the island.

Just tell the cabbie \"Ko Kret\". He will understand."]},"\nGetting back is more interesting still, the easy way out again being the river taxi, plenty of which lounge about near the pier. If not, take the ferry back to Wat Sanam Neua, then take a moto or ",{"type":"''","value":["samlor"]}," out of the soi (5 baht) to the main street.

The most popular option is your ",{"type":"'''","value":["feet"]},". The island is roughly square in shape, each side measuring about 2 km, and a path runs around the entire island. The e walk at a pleasant pace takes about 1.5– 2 hours. Other options are renting a bicycle from the company located in Moo 6; from the 2 baht ferry crossing make your way counter-clockwise around the island about 200 m. At about the same point, which is near the end of the tourist area, motorcycle taxis wait to take people around. If you walk and get tired, you can proceed down one of the paths leading out to piers by the river. From these local piers, you can flag down a small water-taxi. These miniature versions of the famous Thai longtailed boats will zip you around the island and back to the Pak Kret pier on the mainland if you like. Prices are reasonable, maybe 20 baht per person for a group of 4 and the ride warrants a Disneyland \"E\" ticket, but better know how to swim as life vests are not included. Also do not expect to use English with the boatman.\n\nYou can also rent a bicycle at couple of places (for example in Village #1), yet do not expect to find one with a seat for small children.\n\nSightseeing boats that do a loop of the island (see itinerary below) leave the pier every hour from 09:00-17:00, costing 50 baht\/person. There is also the possibility of renting a boat at the price of 500-4,000 baht depending on the distance and the size of the boat. It will take around 1.5 hr for the whole trip.
