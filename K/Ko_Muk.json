The driver of the boat and minivan is the same guy. If you take the latter option it's recommended to arrange accommodation and a pick-up from the Ko Muk pier, otherwise you'll have a 3 km walk or 50 baht motorbike taxi ride to get anywhere on arrival.\n\nThe return trip is easier and cheaper, with the same ferry departing at 07:40. With no booking fees or middleman it is possible to get the ferry for 50 baht and a minivan to Trang for 100 baht. Possible, but not easy. 200 baht is the more likely combined fare.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Farang Beach"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=The more popular of the two beaches."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Tham Morakot"],["alt=Emerald Cave"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Accessible from Farang Beach by boat or kayak.
