Mountainous and covered by tropical forest, much of the coastline is indented with rocky headlands, while the eastern part has some beautiful sand beaches, and in the south coconut plantations and more beautiful smaller beaches. The island has a white beach and clear water and is surrounded by magnificent corals.\n\nDon't be surprised to see crab-eating monkeys and monitor lizards coming down from the mountains. In the uninhabited western and northern parts of the island, bird watchers should have a field day looking out for migrating birds. Snorkelling is easy along the western and southern coast, where some reefs can be accessed directly from the beach.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Ko Ngai or Ko Hai (เกาะไหง)"]}," is an island that is administratively in Amphoe Ko Lanta of Krabi, but easier to access from Trang (from Pak Meng pier, located 15 km away on the mainland opposite, in Trang Province). Standard ferries take about one hour. A boat can be rented for 1,500 baht (10 people) or 6,000-10,000 baht (for 20-40 people). A faster speedboat connection from Pak Meng Pier is also available, departing around the same time. It takes just 20 minutes. \n\nFrom Ko Lanta there is no scheduled ferry service to Ko Ngai although it is possible to rent a private longtail from Saladan (Ko Lanta) during high season (Nov-Apr). Another possibility is to buy an snorkelling trip from Ko Lanta and leave the boat at Ko Ngai.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThere are no roads on the island, so getting around from one beach to another is done on foot, or longtail boats that can be hired at the resorts.\n\nThere is a foot path (jungle trek) from the main beach in the east to two beaches in the south, the westernmost of which has the Ko Ngai Paradise Resort. From there, you can follow a path that goes to national park headquarters area and then to a hill with a two viewpoints.\n\nAn accurate map of the island can be found at OpenStreetMap.
