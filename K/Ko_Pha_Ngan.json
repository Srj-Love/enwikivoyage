Both stations are on the southbound Hay Yai line, but arrival times in Chumphon (when using night trains) are annoyingly early in the morning. For example, the (recommended) express train number #85 arrives around 04:00 after which you'll have to wait about 3 hours for the ferry. On the other hand, if you continue down to Surat Thani you can sleep an extra 3–4 hours plus you will arrive in daylight.

In reality, the Thai authorities are lax in returning emails and\/or will give the runaround, or flat-out refuse to reserve seats for non-Thais during peak travel periods (Dec-Jan and the Songkran holiday in Apr).

These are asking prices before bargaining and any discount. If you rent motorbike for longer, you can get bigger discount. For example, for 3 days rental at 150 baht\/day you can bargain it to 120 baht\/day or from 100 baht\/day to 90 baht\/day. For 2 weeks the price drops even more, from 100 baht\/day to 75 baht\/day. There is good rental shop, Sak, with low prices just next to Nira's bakery in Thong Sala, a short walk from the pier with a couple of other rental shops with similar prices. Rentals are for 24 hours, so if you rent motorbike at 16:00, you have to return it before 16:00 the next day if you don't want to pay a surcharge. Motorbikes are rented without fuel, so you have to go first to petrol station (figure on about 40 baht per litre of 91 octane gasoline at big petrol stations), more in remoter places like jungle road to Thong Nai Pan 50 baht\/1 l). Foreigners are asked to leave their passport as a deposit, or a copy of their passport and a large cash deposit (1,000-10,000 baht). You are strongly advised not to leave your passport. Renting through the place you stay might be a better option, but does not guarantee that you will avoid the bike repair scam.\n\nSome rental shops overcharge for every scratch or dent. They don't fix, but rather replace the whole part - so note damages to the bike on the rental contract. Be aware that your passport will be held until you pay the extortionate repair cost. You can negotiate the costs down from exorbitant to high, but keep your cool, don't yell and stay polite. This practice is very common all over the region. It's not unheard of that you are asked to pay for damage you haven't done. In most cases, it's the combination of very bad & dangerous roads and inexperienced or intoxicated driving that causes accidents. Some good advice is to take pictures of your bike as you rent it, but if the guy has your passport, this won't do any good.

Do not accept the price at the pier and walk rather 300 m to the roundabout in Thong Sala where there is a taxi station with normal prices. From Thong Sala to Baan Tai\/Khai or Chalok Lam should be priced around 100 baht\/person, Haad Rin 150 baht\/person, Haad Yao\/Salad 150 baht\/person, Thong Nai Pan or Had Sadet 250 baht.\n\nIt is important to note that ALL taxi service on Ko Pha Ngan is provided by songthaew (pick-up truck).

Please check to make sure you are booking through a TAT registered travel agent.\n\nIn both Thong Sala and Haad Rin vendors sell pretty much anything you can think of, and probably some things you don't need at all. You can try to bargain, but realistically, the prices are set. You may get a deal every now and again, but it's the exception to the rule. Remember that you're in a tourist area and that prices usually are above the level of Bangkok. The further you go from the ferry piers, the better your chance of haggling gets.\n\nMain purchases you will find on Ko Pha Ngan include hammocks (check out \"Hammock Home Gallery\" in Thong Sala) as well as some of the local artist's works. Most of the clothing is of the variety that you will find in Bangkok, but generally it is a bit more expensive, as it has been imported to the island for sale.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Art Galleries"]}," are considered to be a rising business on Ko Pha Ngan.

For a slightly more authentic experience (and cheaper than the well-decorated cafe\/restaurants by Haad Rin beach), patronise the more modest street carts where you might see some Thais eating.\n\nThe best area for cheap eats is definitely the food carts in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Thong Sala"]]},", the main town on the island. In the evening you can eat at the night market (from 40 baht\/meal (usually curried meat with rice or fried rice or pad Thai), soups from 30 baht, pancakes from 20-30 baht, meat on sticks 10-30 baht\/stick.) Free Wi-Fi in a roofed hall. Across the road from 7-Eleven in Chalok Lam are also some Thai street stalls where you will find locals eating. In front of Tesco you can buy sticks with fried meatballs for 5 baht\/stick and at the junction next to entrance to Tesco parking lot you can buy in the morning (07:00-09:00) sticky rice with pork\/chicken\/livers packed in banana leaves for 10 baht for a small portion. There are also a few street stalls. There is also a small market next to 7-Eleven in Thong Sala in the direction of Haad Rin (after Walking St traffic lights) with Thai meals for 30-50 baht.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Drink "]},"\n:",{"type":"''","value":["Individual listings can be found in Ko Pha Ngan's ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ko Pha Ngan#Orientation"],["places"]]}," articles"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Sleep "]},"\n:",{"type":"''","value":["Individual listings can be found in Ko Pha Ngan's ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ko Pha Ngan#Orientation"],["places"]]}," articles"]},"\n\nAs a general guide: As further you walk along the beach to the last resort, the better and quieter the accommodation.\n\nYou can usually find accommodation at the pier when you arrive, many of resorts offers taxi service from pier for free. However, during the full moon period it is worth booking ahead unless you want to sleep on the beach or spend the night in one of the more expensive lodgings. If you are thinking of booking accommodation on-line before you arrive, make sure you book direct with the resort or a trustworthy booking site as there are numerous fake sites for several well-known Ko Pha Ngan resorts appearing on the Internet.\n\nThere is more to Ko Pha Ngan than the Full Moon Party and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Haad Rin"]]},", so don't be afraid to venture out to other beaches. You can still get to the party from just about everywhere.\n\nThe decent rooms tend to run out a few days before the Full Moon Party, and throughout the peak season (Dec-Feb). If you have a short vacation or like to have a soft landing, you might want to book a room in advance. This can be quite hard on the less accessible beaches, such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Haad Tien"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Haad Yuan"]]},".\n\nIf you decide to test your luck, try to arrive as early in the day as possible (09:00 seems to be a good time) to have the most time and options for accommodations.\n\nIf you come in relatively low-season in Jul and Aug, it is a good idea to book a room in advance just for the first night and rent a motorbike to look around. Beaches differ a lot (some of them are good for diving\/snorkelling, some are good for swimming), so do villages (some are really quiet, some are packed with bars). Motorbike trip by the seaside to Chalok Lam and all the places on the way, and to Haad Rin on the other end of the island. Should not be a problem even for less experienced riders and will help you to choose the perfect place which suits your preferences. More remote places are harder to get by motorbike, so if you are thinking about staying in Thong Nai Pan or Bottle Beach, you have to rely on reviews.\n\nFor a cheap bungalow, literally moments from white beaches (but no surf whatsoever), turn left from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Thong Sala"]]}," and you will pass strings of quiet bays, each with one or more resorts, featuring a bar, a restaurant, rooms and bungalows, and a few dozen laid back tourists for company. Try ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Haad Yao"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Haad Son"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Haad Salad"]]}," or any of the others along the same strip.\n\nFor the north of the island, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chalok Lam"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ko Ma"]]},"\/",{"type":"[[","value":[["Haad Mae Haad"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Haad Khom"]]}," & ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bottle Beach"]]}," are popular.\n\nFor long-term stay, you can rent whole house (1 bedroom, small kitchen, bath, Wi-Fi, electricity\/water included) for 5-6,000 baht\/month, not on the beach. Bigger houses with 2 bedrooms from 10-12,000 baht\/month. For a 2 week booking, don't expect half of the monthly price. Two weeks in a 2 bedroom house costs a minimum of 7-9,000 baht, 1 bedroom 3-4,000 baht.\n\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Emergency contacts"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Fire"]},": dial 199"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Police"]},": dial 191 (077 377 114)"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Tourist Police"]},": dial 1155 (this supersedes the old \"1699\" number)"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Phangan Rescue Centre"]},": dial 077 377 118"]},"\nYes, the Full Moon Party (as well as others) is full of drugs, but these days it's also full of plain clothed policemen out to bust you. Be very careful if you intend to consume illicit drugs. Roadblocks are common, particularly in the week before the FMP between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Thong Sala"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Haad Rin"]]},".

Be aware that you may not be able to bail yourself out of trouble, especially if you get transferred to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Surat Thani"]]}," - and that bribing Thai police will at least cut a deep hole into your travel budget, if it is possible at all. Do not keep drugs on you, in your room, or in your vehicle.\n\nIf you plan to drink at a party, make sure you have reliable transportation set up beforehand. The roads here are nothing to mess with, and too many people try to drive home because they don't have a taxi waiting. If nothing else, find a safe corner and sleep it off before you head home.\n\nIt's not a good idea to accept drinks or food from strangers; there are reported incidents of spiked drinks (from both locals and \"fellow\" travellers). There have been reports of LSD buckets foisted upon unsuspecting partyers in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Haad Rin"]]},". Drugged drinks are often and unfortunately followed up by robbery, sexual harassment, or even (gang) rapes. The best idea is to take your own drinks and stay with your friends.\n\nOn closer inspection of the buckets sold, most liquor bottles are unsealed, so there is uncertainty about the true contents of every bottle. This may be why so many people get sick.\n\nHowever a local club owner states \"we use the small bottles for the buckets and it is cheaper and easier for us to re-use the small bottles. The local stockists always run out of small bottles so we often replace the contents with that from a larger bottle of the same liquor (some clubs use cheaper liquor. Ask politely at the bar for original liquor and be prepared to pay more for original liquor).\n\nHangovers come from dehydration. Most kids drink buckets all night, then party in the morning sun on alcohol. Best advice is to drink water regularly, even at night as its hot and sweaty.\n\nBefore buying a bucket, check the seal of the bottle and politely ask what's in it if you are worried. Apart from that, remember the fact that buckets can be very strong and unpredictable. If you intend to drink a lot, try to have solid food beforehand, or you might \"lose it\" very fast.\n\nIt's advisable to leave all valuables in a safety deposit box or in your guest house owner's hands instead of taking them to the party.\n\nWear shoes or sandals to avoid injury from broken bottles or burning cigarettes.\n\nIf you're averse to getting knocked on the head with flaming batons, then don't venture too close to the fire poi swingers on the beach, as skillful as they may be, the fire sometimes gets out of hand and hits nearby tourists. \"Fire Skipping Rope \/ Jump through Fire Hoop\" are dangerous games provided by a few of the beach bars. Take care when participating in these games, especially if you are drunk.\n\nIf you plan to leave the island the day after the Full Moon Party, be aware that the boats are usually packed with other tourists who have the same idea. Make sure you're not getting on an overloaded boat. The same applies to taxi-boats before and after the FMP. Thais frequently overload their longtail boats and lost luggage is at your own expense. Better to get off, reclaim your money and wait for the next one.\n\nThere are many good places to stay in Ko Pha Ngan. If you want to stay close to the action, but not TOO close, you may choose the resorts on the \"sunset side\" of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Haad Rin"]]},". You can stay just about anywhere on the island and still get to the Full Moon Party, so don't be afraid to venture away from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Haad Rin"]]},", which is the most developed and least Thai beach of them all. There are over 30 coves and beaches on the island, each with its own distinct qualities. Check out local information to find which beach suits you.\n\nWalk away from every potential conflict with locals. You will stand no chance and it's a surefire way to get hospitalized. Do not get inappropriately rowdy or swear at the beach bar staff. In April 2007 an Israeli tourist got stabbed to death right on the dance floor in one of the bars on ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Haad Rin"]]}," beach. Violence is frequent. Locals will not help you in a fight and will in fact gang up on you whether you are right or wrong, and \"fellow\" travellers will do their best to stay out of it. If you find yourself targeted, LEAVE THE PLACE IMMEDIATELY and don't come back the same night.\n\nCompared to most of Thailand (and especially the north), citizens of Ko Pha Ngan are generally aggressive, rude, and unfriendly after decades of particularly rowdy tourism. Don't expect to be treated as much more than a human ATM. However, it is worth bearing in mind how you would feel if you had to tolerate some of the appalling and disrespectful behaviour from foreigners that you will see here in your home community. Beware also of other travellers who can also be pretty aggressive when drunk, male or female.\n\nIf you walk on some of the smaller backroads of the island, dogs can be a real danger. Many of the dogs you encounter will be highly territorial and unfriendly (barking, baring their teeth, getting very close), especially if it is a group of dogs. Getting bitten means an urgent flight to Bangkok to get rabies treatment, so this is important to avoid. Do not stare directly at the dogs (but do look at them every once in a while as it seems to deter them somewhat), and do not run. Try talking to them continuously in a calm and friendly voice (\"what a good dog\", etc.) and move slowly but surely, either away from the dog, or, if it's critical for you to pass, then as far away as possible from the dog's \"home territory\" (e.g., if it ran out of a house on the left side of the road, move along the right side). In an emergency, remember that they're probably as scared of you as you are of them, so any violent motion (like throwing something) will likely send them running back, but only temporarily. Do this only as a last resort.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Internet cafes"]}," are plentiful and typically also offer international calls, fax services, and flight confirmation. The connection and speed is generally good. Expect to pay 60 baht\/hr (1 baht\/min) for Internet in central locations. One baht per minute is typical for predominantly tourist-oriented shops, many of which also offer lower rates for pre-paid blocks of time. In travel agency Tan Tour (50 m to west of 7-Eleven next to the pier) the friendly owner Tomas is famous for not taking charging customers very seriously, so if you stay only a short time you can usually use the Internet for free, or for a longer time you will usually end up paying only 20 baht instead of 40-60 baht.\n\nNext door to the 7-Eleven in Thong Sala at the pier there is free (open) Wi-Fi for everyone in Sweet Cafe, so if you don't mind sitting in the sun you can use it for free. Also in the food court in the Thong Sala night market (actually open all day) there is free Wi-Fi for everyone. It's not difficult to find well-equipped, quiet, air-con Internet cafés that charge 60 baht\/hr. Shops that can accommodate users who want to hook up their own laptops can easily be found. Printing (black\/white) is usually 10 baht\/page (30 baht\/page for colour).\n\nWhen you venture away from the more developed beaches, expect to pay up to 3 baht a minute. It can be cheaper just for staying in touch (Skype\/Facebook) to buy a SIM card with a 1GB data package for 1 month for 214 baht (AIS\/DTAC), which is enough for mobile Internet, but be aware some beaches do not have a 3G signal (Haad Yuan\/Haad Tien, for example).\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Mobile phone\/SIM cards"]}," can be bought and topped-up all around island in many 7-Elevens. Mobile signal strength for DTAC (Happy) or AIS (1-2-Call) is good all around the island.

Most advertise a rate of 15 baht\/minute (or 25 baht\/minute to mobile phones).
