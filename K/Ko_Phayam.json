Ko Phayam has no roads suitable for automobiles, thus motorbikes are the chief means of transport. Tourists hire motorbikes at the pier and ride along the road to the resorts. There two major beaches\/bays, Ao Yai and Ao Kao Kwai (Buffalo Bay). For those who want to get away from it all, Ko Phayam is reminiscent of what Ko Samui was like 30 years ago, before the airport and hotel developments.\n\nAo Yai is the largest bay on the west coast, about 3 km long and 300 m wide, with a grey sand beach.\n\nKo Phayam is widely thought to be one of the most beautiful Thai islands.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nFlight service from Bangkok (BKK) to Ranong Airport (UNN) and back daily via ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.happyair.co.th Happy Air"]}," and from Bangkok Don Mueang (DMK) to Ranong and back daily via ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.nokair.com Nok Air"]},".\n\nKo Phayam is just over 30km from Ranong, about 2 hours from the mainland's ",{"type":"'''","value":["Phayam Pier"]}," by slow boat, 30-40 minutes by speed boat.

Motorbikes and scooters can be rented at Phayam Cottage Internet Shop near the main arrival ferry pier as well as many other places. The price is roughly 150-200 baht per day unless heavily booked. Gasoline costs 40-50 baht per litre. If you rent a motorbike don't drive it on the beach. There are rumours that you can get fined 5,000 baht because of fine print on the rental agreement. More importantly, it's environmentally stupid.\n\nMotorbike taxi drivers will be waiting for you as you step off the pier and can be found around the island, differentiated by their blue or red vests. Maps of the island near the pier are colour coded, showing you what the fixed price is to get to certain areas. 70 baht from the pier to Ao Yai.
