[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Ko Phrathong"]}," (เกาะพระทอง) is an island in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Northern Andaman Coast"]]},", part of Phang Nga Province in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Thailand"]]},". It lies approximately 10 km off the port town of Khuraburi, with an area of 88 square km.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nKo Phrathong is the middle link in a chain of three islands. To the north is Ko Ra. It is long, mountainous and covered in ancient rainforest. It is uninhabited and home to many rare animal species. To the south is Ko Kho Khao which has physical features similar to Ko Phratong. The islands are part of the Mu Ko Ra - Ko Phrathong National Park, established in 2001.\n\nKo Phrathong is virtually flat and has over 9 km of deserted beach on the Andaman Sea and over 7 km of beach on the bay facing Khuraburi. It is also only 60 km from the Surin Islands, Richelieu Rock, and only slightly further to the Similan Islands, all renowned diving locations.\n\nThe island's natural landscape is chiefly savannah—flat grassland—similar to the savannahs of Africa, and a rich and impenetrable mangrove forest along the east side extending around 60% of the island, with extensive sea grass vegetation hosting rare animal species like the dugong, or sea-cow.\n\nMany other animals inhabit the island ecosystem, including the leopard cat, the sambar deer, snakes such as king cobras and pythons, and birds like sea eagles, bhramini kites, and wild chickens.\n\nOn the east side there is a small fisherman’s village, Thapayoi, and on the southeast end is another small village, Thung Dap. These villages total fewer than 300 Moken inhabitants, a rare tribe of sea gypsies, and Thais. The larger village, Thapayoi, has a school and a staffed community health centre. At the northern tip there is the third and most modern village of the island, Baan Lion. Funded by Lions Club to help the local people recover from the 2004 tsunami, it features some 20 concrete elevated houses and a school, and it was built further ashore than the former village that had been razed by the waves. Nowadays the village is almost deserted, with only 6 families permanently living in it, yet there two institutions that keep it alive: the primary school which is open and also serves as a rescue point for the locals from future tsunamis, and the office of the Naucrates Project, an international NGO whose objective is to monitor and help protect the local environment and fauna.\n\nTourism on the island is at it's very early start, due to the lack of regular transport facilities and of 24-hour electricity, thus making it a great destination for those looking for a rich natural and almost unspoiled environment. As of 2014, all the 7 resorts on the island are grouped nearby on the sandy west coast near Phrathong Bay.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nLongtail boat from Khuraburi pier, 1 hr, 1,400 baht one-way to the northern tip of the island. Other island destinations can be negotiated. Boats can accommodate up to 8 passengers. Last departure from Khuraburi is 16:30.\n\nLongtail boat, Ko Phrathong to Khuraburi: last boat 15:00.\n\nTransit by speedboat (~20 min) at a time of your choosing can be arranged for about 6,000 baht one-way.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Golden Buddha Beach Resort"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.kohphrathong.com\/golden_buddha_resort.html"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["price=3,000-33,000 baht"],["content=26 accommodations near the beach.
