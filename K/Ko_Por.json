The majority of the 500 residents of the island are Muslims who support themselves through agriculture and fishing.

You can discover the local flora, fauna and Thai rural culture.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nIn Ko Por there is enough to do for 3-4 days but not for a long stay. Some villagers can show you how to cut a rubber tree, take you fishing, or for a trip on a longtail boat. Hiking on the island is also very nice. It's also fun to be on the beach in the evening, when there may be hundreds of little crabs scurrying out of the water and across the sand.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\nThere are no shops on the island, so if you need something, get it on Ko Lanta.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nLocal food, composed mostly of seafood and local fruit.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nThere are some home stays where you can live with a Thai family.

It would also be respectful to refrain from drinking among Muslims, for whom alcohol is haram (forbidden).\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Krabi Province"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["no Wikipedia link"]]}]
