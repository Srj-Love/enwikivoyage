Racha Yai lies about 8 km due south of the Laem Prom Thep. Racha Noi is about 5 km SSW of Racha Yai.

A hilltop viewpoint on the bay's south offers a magnificent view of the whole island. \n\nKo Racha Noi, 10 km from Raya Yai, is the result of coral reef build up, and there are more rocks than beaches. In a small bay on the west is a boat anchorage. The waters at Raya Noi are emerald green, and the fishing there is famous, but swimming is not recommended.  \n\nRacha Yai is a travel and tour option year round. When the seas and winds are too strong, boats will cancel their trips for safety reasons. During the summer season this only occurs a few times.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nOnce at Racha Yai your feet become your carriage. The island has a small network of dirt paths that link all of the beaches and resorts. You can easily walk from Bungalow Bay to Siam Beach and back again.

Motorbikes can be rented also, but distances are short.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nLooking back towards Phuket from Siam Beach is one of the best things to do.

The sun lounge chairs for rent are spaced a good distance apart from each other and there is only one row unlike the crowded beaches of Phuket and Coral Island where the chairs are sometimes 5-6 deep.\n\nChairs are also available at Lah Bay on the other side of the island, with a restaurant only a few metres from the water.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Rustling Palms on Raya Coral Island"],["alt=Thailand Travel Plan"],["url=http:\/\/www.thailandtravelplan.co.uk\/ko-raya-island.htm"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Ko Raya is the perfect destination if you're looking to escape the more popular (and busier) Phuket.

Perhaps due to the distance from Phuket or the island's less familiar or attractive name means that there are fewer visitors to this island than almost every other island around Phuket. The physical layout of Racha Yai offers places to snorkel no matter what time of year it is. Even on days when there are large waves, there will be a protected cove to snorkel in. \n\nWater clarity and visibility is some of the best in Phuket. The water has a turquoise colour and a lot of marine life. The depths range from a few meters to deeper. Most snorkelling is done from speedboats or from the shore in Batok Bay and Raya Bay.
