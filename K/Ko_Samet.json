Some parts are concrete and some parts are only a dirt trail which get quite bumpy. There are two ways to get round the island. The first is by songthaew (usually a rather well-worn pickup truck with two benches in the back and no roof), which costs 200 baht for a private trip, or between 20 and 60 baht per person when full, depending on which beach you are going to. This is a rather expensive method to get around the island, and the dusty roads can make it an uncomfortable trip. The second way is by renting a motorcycle for 300 baht\/hr 500 baht\/day or ATV (4 wheeled motorbikes) for 500 baht\/1 hr or 1,200 baht\/day. You will usually be able to rent it from your hotel. Leaving your passport or a deposit is not necessary or advisable.\n \nMotor Bike Hire -The island has more motorbike hire shops than any other shops so they are not hard to locate and prices are standard ranging from 300-400 baht per day for manual or automatic bikes. Before hiring a bike you should be aware that once you enter the main national park entrance the roads are in very poor condition and only people with some experience would be advised to tackle them.\n\nGold Shop: This motorbike hire shop is just up from the national park entrance and 7-Eleven (opposite Chilli Restaurant). This family takes very good care of their motorbikes and ATVs. The owner, Jep, is a very friendly guy and always willing to help. His son also rents their vehicles from next to the 7-Eleven by the park entrance and Bow is also very helpful and if you rent for a few days will often offer good discounts.\n\nMountain Bike Rental - Mountain bikes can be rented from Village Cafe (Internet Cafe) opposite the school in the main village.

Tourist seasons on Ko Samet are generally from Nov-Feb and from Jun-Aug, at which time finding vacant accommodation can be a challenge. Also, beware of weekends and public holidays as the islands will be very busy.\n\nThe northernmost beaches of Hat Sai Keaw and Ao Hin Kok have many bungalow operations with typical Thai concrete bunker-style rooms. If your room doesn't have air-conditioning it can get a little hot during the day. At the very northern end are a few upscale resorts. At beaches further south you'll find the bungalows ranging from dismal shacks to four-star, air-conditioned mini suites. Unless you've made the mistake of booking your room with the touts back at the dock you'll find a place by strolling down the beach. As this island becomes more and more popular it's getting harder to find rock-bottom prices. On some beaches you can expect to pay 600 baht for the basics. Most of the accommodation is first-come, first-served and the cheaper bungalows tend to go fastest. High-end establishments usually take reservations by phone, fax and via the web, whilst the cheaper ones do not.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Budget "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Chilis"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Just outside the national park boundaries, about 10–15 min walk from the main ferry terminal"],["phone="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=A nice hotel\/ restaurant.
