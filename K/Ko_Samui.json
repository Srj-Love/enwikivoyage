The palm-fringed shoreline and coconut and fruit cultivation of the coastal lowlands rise to a central granite massif, the slopes of which are cloaked in virgin rainforest.\n\nAt 247 km², Samui is the second largest island in Thailand and the largest island in an archipelago of over 80 (mostly uninhabited) islands which form the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ang Thong National Marine Park"]]},", a kayaking and snorkelling paradise. At 25 km long and 21 km wide, Samui is big enough for serious exploration by the adventurous and fit, but can be circumnavigated in just a couple of hours by motorbike or car.\n\nThe island was probably first inhabited about 15 centuries ago, settled by fishermen from the Malay Peninsula and south China. It appears on Chinese maps dating back to 1687, under the name Pulo Cornam. The name Samui is mysterious in itself. Perhaps it is an extension of the name of one of the native trees, mui, or it is a corruption of the Chinese word Saboey, meaning \"safe haven\".\n\nUntil the late 20th century, Samui was an isolated self-sufficient community, having little connection with the mainland of Thailand. The island was even without roads until the early 1970s, and the 15 km journey from one side of the island to the other involved a whole-day trek through the mountainous central jungles.\n\nIn the early 1970s the first backpackers travelling on the back of a coconut boat arrived on Ko Samui. For years after that the island just had a few bungalows and a trickle of travelers. Things started to change in the early 1990s when tourists started arriving in full boats and since then the place has grown substantially. Samui is now the second most popular island destination in Thailand (Phuket is first). Ko Samui may not be the country’s most beautiful island but it is still an oasis of natural beauty with its white sandy beaches, dazzling coral, luscious lagoons, picturesque waterfalls, swaying coconut trees, and crystal clear water. The water at Bophut Beach, though, is often murky, especially around December.\n\nUnfortunately, development on Ko Samui is starting to take its toll and the beaches of Chaweng and Lamai are overcrowded in the high season.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh =   29"],["febhigh =   30"],["marhigh =   31"],["aprhigh =   32"],["mayhigh =   33"],["junhigh =   32"],["julhigh =   32"],["aughigh =   32"],["sephigh =   32"],["octhigh =   31"],["novhigh =   30"],["dechigh =   33"],["janlow =   24"],["feblow =   25"],["marlow =   26"],["aprlow =   26"],["maylow =   26"],["junlow =   26"],["jullow =   25"],["auglow =   25"],["seplow =   25"],["octlow =   24"],["novlow =   24"],["declow =   24"],["janprecip =  138"],["febprecip =  58"],["marprecip =  78"],["aprprecip =  77"],["mayprecip =  147"],["junprecip =  113"],["julprecip =  123"],["augprecip =  119"],["sepprecip =  117"],["octprecip =  290"],["novprecip =  490"],["decprecip =  209"],["description = Check ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ko Samui's 7 day forecast"]}," at ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.tmd.go.th\/en\/province.php?id=72 TMD.go.th"]}]]},"\nSamui's weather patterns are a little different from the rest of Thailand.

Some entail a 60 minute bus ride to Don Sak pier followed by a 90 minute ferry crossing, others a 30 minute bus ride with a longer ferry crossing. Tickets are sold by numerous agents who meet each train and airplane. Should cost certainly less than 300 baht even if bought this way (return combo boat + bus ticket on a more comfortable Seatran Ferry bought on the Nathon Pier on Samui officially costs 230 baht).\n\nFrom Don Sak Pier, there are 2 ferry companies (each line has a departure every 60 min.) and a smaller passenger boat.

There is a small on board shop on the lower desk but the prices are grossly inflated (instant noodles cup, which costs 15 baht in a 7-Eleven, is sold for 50 baht there), so if you still choose this boat, better to bring your own snacks. The people aboard Songserm ferry are mostly, if not all, foreigners.\n\nRaja and Seatran ferries are much bigger, have several decks (entrance to most of the those, including air conditioned areas, is free), much less packed just because of size (still can be at peak times of high season), equipped with numerous TV's (Thai channels), have big cafeterias (with much friendlier prices, such as 20 baht for the same cup of noodles), and the passengers are mostly Thai, as well as some expats and tourists.

It includes a free air conditioned deck and several comfortable seats. This ferry also transports cars, so can be used should you decide to come with your own transport.

They drive fixed routes at fixed prices per person until 18:00, ranging from 20-80 baht depending on distance. After 18:00, songthaews serve as normal taxis and prices must be negotiated first. Even if you pay for a trip, however, the songthaew may stop and pick-up more passengers on the way. Metered taxi service is operated by private taxi companies. The drivers, however, are very reluctant to use their meters, and, especially on popular beaches or entry points to the island, tend to ask foreigners much more than normal fare. Some, say, on Nathon pier, will even show you official-looking papers with \"fixed\" prices like 600-800 baht for a 25–30 km trip to Chaweng or Lamai Beach. This is not true, and once they know you're aware of that, it's usually possible to bargain (for this distance, you should bargain to at least 400 baht, or even better 300 baht (outdated bargain prices, in 2013 more likely prices around 500 to 600 baht from Nathon to Chaweng or Lamai), which is still higher than the Bangkok metered taxi price). On the popular beaches it may be impossible at all to get a reasonable fare sometimes.

It is recommended though, to hire only from a reputable company as there have been reports of scams. Some places have been known to steal bikes that they have rented out. Also rental motorbikes are not insured. If they tell you they have insurance, it's not true. If something happens, you can't claim for it. Read the rental agreement extra carefully, as too many (it's ",{"type":"''","value":["not"]}," typical for other parts of Thailand e.g. Chiang Mai) will state that you may not replace any broken\/damaged parts yourself. This is a scam, as instead they will replace it for you for a price several times higher (sometimes also stated in the agreement) than it actually costs. They ",{"type":"''","value":["will"]}," check any old scratches and\/or serial numbers, if noted in the agreement, and demand that price even if you have already replaced that part yourself! For the same reason, inspect the motorbike carefully and be sure any existing scratches\/damages are written in the agreement before you have taken the motorbike. Take photographs of the bike.\nMotorbike shops will likely want you to leave your passport as collateral. This is a common practice in Thailand, and, by itself, shouldn't raise much concern, however most government travel advisory services advise against leaving your passport anywhere as a deposit for obvious reasons. Combined with the scams and bad practices mentioned above, however, it may lead to a situation where your passport is held as a hostage until you pay what they want. For this reason, it's unwise to return your motorbike just before your departure. Leave at least several hours, or perhaps a day, to settle any problems if they arise. If the shop's demands are clearly illegitimate (the agreement you have signed does not contain any silly conditions and prices, the price they ask for damages is unreasonable, or the damage was clearly done before you rented the motorbike) - call Tourist Police. They 'will' help your cause, although shop owners will try to convince you otherwise.\n\nIf hiring a motorbike doesn't appeal to you, then there are motorbike-taxis willing to take you around for a (negotiable in advance, as foreigners are commonly asked an exorbitant price) fee, as well as other modes of transportation.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Bicycles"]},"\nBicycles can be hired very cheaply on Ko Samui.

You can pick up and drop off at the airport or some other locations.  Driving is easy on the island as long as you are not in a hurry and having a car gives you easy access to almost all areas of the island.

Even though the best time year of the year to dive in the Ko Samui is between Jun-Aug, it is still perfectly possible to dive virtually all year round. As Thailand is considered one of the safest destinations for diving and snorkelling in the world, it is perfect for novices.\nUnder sea visibility in some places around Ko Samui is very good (distances of up to 10–30 m).

Favourite dishes from the south include Indian-style Muslim curry (massaman), rice noodles in fish curry sauce (khanom jeen) and chicken birayani. Popular local foods are salted eggs and rambutan.\n\nDual pricing is common: some restaurants have two menus, one for tourists and the other for Thai people, at about a quarter of the tourist prices. Main courses in a standard, low-key Thai restaurant should be under 100 baht (except some seafood dishes), so if prices seem unreasonably steep, head elsewhere.
