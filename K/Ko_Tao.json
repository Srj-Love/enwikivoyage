The island is geared towards diving tourists more than backpackers on a budget. You won't find cheap food stalls here. Ko Tao is a great place to learn how to dive. There are hardly any currents and a wide selection of dive sites and dive shops, schools, and resorts. Activity options are growing outside of diving and the food and nightlife options are some of the best in the Gulf of Thailand.\n\nKo Tao is a small island of approximately 21 km² and receives over a 100,000 visitors per year. To minimize your impact on the eco-system, notice that there are no garbage disposal facilities, so everything that can't be burned has to be taken away. Try to avoid plastic bags that are given out for every purchase you make. There is also no sanitation department to clean the roads or other public areas, so don't dump your waste thoughtlessly. Water is scarce and electricity expensive, so don't waste them.\n\nPeak seasons in Ko Tao are from Dec-Mar and Jul-Aug. It is a quite popular destination among Thais also, so it can be nearly fully booked on Thai holidays.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Ko Tao map.png"],["thumb"],["400px"],["Map of Ko Tao"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By plane "]},"\n\nThe nearest airports are in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ko Samui"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Surat Thani (province)"],["Surat Thani"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chumphon"]]},". Ko Samui and Surat Thani are fairly well connected to major cities in the region such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bangkok"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Penang"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Singapore"]]}," whereas Chumphon is only connected to Bangkok. Thai Airways and Bangkok Airways operate almost all flights from the private airport in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ko Samui"]]}," and both charge artificially high rates. Bangkok Airways runs many more daily flights to and from Ko Samui than Thai Airways. Firefly operates flights from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kuala Lumpur"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Penang"]]},". When flying out of Ko Samui keep in mind that there is a 300 baht departure tax, the highest in Thailand.\n\nSeveral airlines, including Thai AirAsia, China Southern Airlines, TransAsia Airways, Nok Air, and Thai Airways, operate from the Surat Thani Airport at lower prices. Solar Air and Nok Air fly from Don Muang Airport (BKK) to Chumphon.\n\nOnce you fly in, you'll have to take a ferry to Ko Tao.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By boat "]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" From Surat Thani "]},"\n\nIf you're coming from the south, you can take a ferry from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Surat Thani"]]}," on the mainland with a travel time of around 3 hr for the morning ferry, or from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ko Samui"]]},", 1.5 hr, or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ko Pha Ngan"]]}," 1 hr. If you're taking a boat from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Surat Thani (province)"],["Surat Thani"]]},", one possibility might be an overnight ferry. These depart around 23:00 and arrive in the morning, about 06:00 (subject to changes). It's advisable to arrive early to grab a mattress. As most of the boats are formerly cargo boats the passenger facilities are basic.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" From Bangkok\/Chumphon "]},"\n\nThe northern terminal for the island ferry service is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chumphon"]]},". Numerous agents sell tickets for a variety of boats of varying size and speed travelling in from the north. The fastest takes about 90 min, the slowest almost 5 hr. The Lomprayah Company has a pickup service from your hotel to the pier which will cost 100 baht. The ticket itself is 600 baht wherever you book it.\n\nThese ferries only depart Chumphon at 07:00, 13:30, 23:00 and 24:00. The ferries at 07:00 and 13:30 are the normal passenger ferries offered by ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.lomprayah.com Lomprayah"]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.seatrandiscovery.com Seatran"]},", and ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.songserm-expressboat.com\/en.php Songserm"]},"\n\nThe late night ferries are normally vehicle or cargo ferries, making for a slower (5-6 hr trip, arriving at 05:00) and are less comfortable. If you are arriving via bus or train, be sure to arrive well before the ferry times, as the ferry terminal is around 1 hr travel time from the train station, and a missed connection either results in a late night trip on the vehicle\/cargo ferry or an overnight stay and a 05:30 start to catch the bus to the ferry terminal for the first ferry the next day.\n\nSangserm offer VIP combined coach and boat tickets from Bangkok, claiming to take 6 hr by bus and 1.5 hr by boat. In fact, it takes closer to 9 hr by bus and 3 hr by boat, neither of which are particularly comfortable. Also, Songserm does not go when there are high waves and they do not inform their customers about it upon arrival. Furthermore, they deny refunds and are extremely rude about it. This agency should be avoided.\n\nA good solution if coming from Bangkok is to book ",{"type":"''","value":["Sleeper Train #85"]},"; leaving Bangkok around 17:30 and arriving in Chumphon at 03:57 and then have a ticket booked for the 07:00 ferry. Most ferry operators can pick you up from the station where you can while away the 3 hr connection gap. You can also buy your ferry ticket at the station when you get off the train at 04:00. Lomprayah have a ticket office and a ticket on a waiting comfortable large bus is included in the price.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" From the other islands "]},"\nYou can also day trip on diving charters from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ko Samui"]]},".

Some roads lead over the spine of small mountains that run along the middle of the island and are all dirt, can become impassable after rain, and can be challenging even to a skilled driver. If you are looking for an adventure, the dirt roads are a good place to find it. Also be aware that distances can be quite deceiving due to the quality and elevation changes of the trail. There are usually plenty of taxis available in both Sairee Village and Mae Haad, however they tend to be expensive given the actual distance you travel. The best way to travel is by renting a small scooter or motorcycle. This gives you the freedom to explore all of the treasures of the island without paying the large taxi costs.\n\nYou can rent bicycles and motorcycles at a few places on Sairee Beach, Mae Haad, and Chalok. Be careful if you rent a motorbike as the dirt roads can get dangerous. ATVs (all terrain vehicles) are dangerous (ask any medical clinic) and expensive (500+ baht\/day) and should be avoided in favour of Honda Dreams (150-200 baht\/day) or Clicks (200-250 baht\/day).\n\nIt is normal practice for motorcycle rental places to ask for a passport as deposit. This is due to the fear of drunken tourists crashing their bike and not returning it. You should be wary of handing over your passport unless you are positive of the legitimacy of the operation.\n\nAn increasing number of rental shops are charging large amounts of money for non-existent scratches on bikes when returning them, notably the shop next to 7-Eleven in Sairee Village (Save Way Travel) and Owen Bikes opposite the petrol station in Sairee Beach. Make sure you note and photograph all scratches and dents when you take delivery of a rental bike. Your best bet is to hire a bike at your accommodation.\n\nLongtail boats offer rides to and from hard-to-get-to beaches on the island. They are a more comfortable way of getting to isolated beaches than attempting to ride over the mountains, however they are noisy.  A round-island longtail can be as much as 2,000 baht, whereas some short trips will only be 100-200 baht.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" See "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Koh Tao Sunset view from Mae Haad.jpg"],["thumb"],["400px"],["Sunset view from Mae Haad"]]},"\n\nTake a bike around the island. Shark Bay is a good place to go snorkelling for the day (don't worry too much about sharks, they are only small black-tip reef sharks). Ko Nang Yuan, Freedom Beach, Laem Thian, Mango Bay, Hin Wong Bay and Tanote Bay are good day excursions, accessible by road or boat. If you rent a scooter, be prepared to turn around or continue by foot since some roads (e.g., to Mango Bay) may be in such condition that you need a dirt bike or a car to travel them. While there are no private beaches in Thailand, some are relatively inaccessible by land, making a longtail boat a necessity.\n\nHowever, to see the best places, go by foot or longtail as some places are inaccessible to motorists. There are a number of good viewpoints around the island such as John Suwan mountain viewpoint in the south of the island, Two View in the centre and Fraggle Rock in the north.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Do "]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Freediving"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Freedive training and education"]}," worldwide is generally done through ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.aidainternational.org AIDA"]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.divessi.com\/freediving SSI"]}," and ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.apnea-academy.com\/ Apnea Academy"]}," freediving courses.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Apnea Total"],["url=http:\/\/www.apnea-total.com\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=on Sairee Beach"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Ko Tao's first and longest established freediving school.

Diving in Ko Tao is easy, fun, and you can see turtles, stingrays, barracudas, lots of small fish, and reef sharks. There is a small chance you'll see a whale shark.\n\nAt Chumphon Pinnacle you are likely to see juvenile bull sharks which have, until recently, been misidentified as grey reef sharks. Be careful as the bulls are curious and very aggressive, though for many years thousands of people have dived this site without a single shark-related incident.\n\nNearly any time of the year except Nov is good diving weather in Ko Tao and visibility can exceed 40 m. Average visibility is around 15-20 m. In Nov visibility is reduced to 5 m and the seas are choppy.\n\nIt is possible and perfectly comfortable to swim and dive without a wetsuit year-round. However, as with most diving, a wetsuit is recommended to help reduce the risk of cuts or injury. Avoid contact with coral reefs.\n\nVarious dive locations around Ko Tao are:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Chumphon Pinnacles"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Southwest Pinnacles"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Green Rock"]},{"type":"*","value":[" White Rock"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Red Rock"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Japanese Gardens"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Twin Pinnacles"]},{"type":"*","value":[" HTMS Sattakut (wreck)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Hin Pee Wee"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Mango Bay"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Ao Leuk"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Shark Island"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Hin Wong"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Lighthouse Bay"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Laem Thien"]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Scuba diving#Learn"],["Dive training"]]}]},"\nThere are a huge number of dive operators on the island, many offering budget accommodation (sometimes described as \"free accommodation\", but this is not really true as you will usually get a discount if you stay elsewhere). The price for PADI open water certification including the new PADI training manual, professional instruction, rental equipment, boat dives, and certification is around 9,800 baht. For SSI open water certification including professional instruction, rental equipment, boat dives, and certification is around 9,000 baht. Insurance and basic accommodation may also be included. Shop around as not all shops teach the course in the same way. Look for experienced dive instructors rather than a low price.\n\nA common method for teaching new divers is to train in a pool first to be taught about 20 basic skills before being taken out into the open water. Others will instead take you to a secluded beach so you will see fish and coral from the start and you might be able to squeeze in a short extra dive in this way, depending on your group and instructor. Some shops have a private pier, some shops depart with a longtail from the beach, and some use the public pier, where you will have to climb across some other boats. Ask, if this matters to you. Most important: find out the maximum number of dive students in a group. Make sure you get an instructor who speaks your language if you are not absolutely sure about your English. These are the little things that will make the difference between an OK course and a great one.\n\nFor those interested in becoming divemasters or instructors, here is a link to a videoguide about the island life ",{"type":"[","value":["https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Ekfdf9Un2Ws&feature=youtu.be ",{"type":"'''","value":["Koh Tao: Thailand's Divestyle Island"]}]},".\n\n",{"type":"=====","value":["PADI dive centres and resorts "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Alvaro Diving & Taraporn Bungalows"],["url=http:\/\/www.divingcourseskohtao.com\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=At a small quiet outer beach of Chalok Ban Kao south of Ko Tao"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Small family-run dive and freedive shop with new equipment, recently established, flexible boat schedules and friendly multilingual staff.

Motorbike accidents are very common, especially when driven under the influence, on the wrong side of the road, in the dark. All terrain vehicles (ATV) are becoming numerous on the island. They are considered a menace by many as they are expensive, slow, noisy and more people injure themselves on them under the mistaken belief that they are safer. They are not. Walk or hire a smaller motorbike instead. Be aware that vehicle hire shops are cheap but can become very expensive if you so much scratch the vehicle, try to hire an older bike than a brand new one.\n\nBe careful when renting bikes. Avoid Owen Bike which has several locations on Ko Tao such as the one on Sairee Beach, just as you enter the main road on the left hand side in the same building as the supermarket, about 2 blocks before the 7-Eleven and a small intersection. You must give them the passport as a deposit, and even though you may take photos and return the bike in perfect condition, the lady will find small \"scratches\" and demand an exorbitant amount. If you do get in such trouble, at least in Ko Tao the police is on our side. There's a friendly police officer named Chet who speaks very good English who might encourage you to file a report, saying that this happens several times a day on Ko Tao. Even if you don't file a report, the police can help you negotiate a lesser amount. If you do file a report, contact your embassy and eventually the company will have to release your passport, because it doesn't belong to you but your country's government.\n\nAdditionally, when renting bikes, insist on a receipt when you have paid the rental fee, or for every subsequent payment per rental day. Do not trust the shops to write accurate information in their own books. If you do not want to provide your passport as a deposit, some shops will ask for 2,000-8,000 baht as a one-off deposit instead.  Again, take many detailed photos of the bike.  Be careful about renting from CJ Guesthouse & Supermarket (13\/1 Moo 1, Sairee Beach), on the same street as New Way Divers.  They will not issue receipts if you do not ask, and later demand that you have not paid the cumulative rental fee when you return the bike. Without a receipt, it will be frustrating and difficult to argue your case. Do not trust CJ Guesthouse and be very careful on this matter even with other shops. Most bike shops on the island rent bikes for 200-250 baht per day.\n\nShould you be unfortunate enough to need minor medical attention there are numerous clinics on the island.  These are only clinics. There are no formal medical facilities on the island. The closest hospitals are in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ko Samui"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chumphon"]]},". Any medical condition not treatable locally will require a minimum of two hours ferry travel to reach a hospital. If the weather is bad the physical rigours of such a trip can complicate medical treatment significantly.\n\nThe island of Ko Tao has no sewage processing and water contamination far exceeds Western standards at nearly all times. This includes both ocean waters and tap waters. Sewer water drains across the beach and even the roads in several areas, and are easily encountered by unwitting tourists. Beware of wet spots on the roads that persist during dry weather and avoid the mist that arises from vehicles passing over them.\n\nSmall scratches or mosquito bites can become seriously infected if swimming, and ear\/eye infections are extremely common among divers, more than many equivalent resort locations. Susceptible individuals and especially parents of young children should be aware of these dangers and exercise great caution.\n\nTap water quality supplied by shallow well pumps should be held suspect even during showering. Low-lying areas in Sairee and especially in Ban Chalok are the most polluted. The eastern areas far from the population centres are the cleanest.\n\nBe also aware of the safety of your hotel room. There are many reports of stolen money, especially at the resorts on Sairee Beach. Normally the thieves (sometimes even hotel staff) sneak into the room while you are out diving and take your cash from your wallet or from your bags.\n\nAs always, watch out for the sun. It seems to be particularly strong on the island due to the bright sand and surroundings, especially when slightly clouded.\n\nWatch out for the gas stations, they like to let the meter start at more than zero. The red gas station on the road that goes up to the turtle is known for this.\n\nWatch out for dive instructors teaching you the nitrox-course without telling you that they charge for it when you check out. Ban´s is known for this.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Go next "]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ko Nang Yuan"]]}," makes a lovely day trip from Ko Tao"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Move on to the nearby islands of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ko Samui"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ko Pha Ngan"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" Visit more than 40 beautiful islands in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ang Thong National Marine Park"]]}," close to Ko Tao"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Central Gulf Coast"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["10.09250"],["99.83568"],["zoom=14"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["guidecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Ko Tao"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Ko Tao"]]}]
