There are two main islands, ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ko Yao Noi"]}," (\"small long island\") and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ko Yao Yai"]},",  (\"big long island\") with Noi being the more developed of the two.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nKo Yao Noi remains a beautiful island, where most people believe that the island should be preserved from human despoilation. It is often described as one of the last islands in the region to not be over-developed. \n\nKo Yao Yai is also a natural beauty, the less developed of the two islands. Ko Yao Yai is significantly larger than Ko Yao Noi.\n\nSea Gypsies (Moken people) inhabited the area before anybody else, except maybe other nomadic people like forest hunters and collectors (Sakai, Negritos). The 3,500 or so inhabitants of Ko Yao Noi are thought to be recent migrants from the Malay Peninsula (Satun, Trang). \n\nThe Mon population, linguistically and culturally belonging to the Khmer ethnolinguistic group, settled in peninsular Thailand ruling over maritime states like Ligor (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nakhon Si Thammarat"]]},"). They melded with southern migrants from Malaysia and with northerners (Thai), over centuries of commercial exchange and political conflict. Most probably the Mon stock remains prevalent for most of the people living in southern Thailand today, including the people of Ko Yao.\n\nNumerous cave paintings hidden in the many islands of the bay, extending from 2000 years ago to last century, attest to the influence of distinct communities in the emergence of a mixed origin population, living now in the provinces of Phang Nga, Phuket, Krabi, and Satun.\n\nThe most recent migrations (17th-18th century) from Satun and Trang to Ko Yao Yai and Ko Yao Noi is corroborated by the particular dialect spoken on the island. It bears obvious Malaysian lexical traces, particularly regarding toponyms and vernacular names of the flora.\n\nThe main industries on the island are fishing and rubber planting. A little rice farming and some fruit, palm, and coconut plantations are present. Boat building and farming techniques here have been passed from generation to generation and, while some of the youngsters leave Ko Yao to seek the bright lights of Phuket, most return to their tight-knit community.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nArrive at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Phuket"]]}," either by:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" By long-distance bus from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bangkok"]]}," or one of the cities north of Phuket."]},{"type":"*","value":[" By air to ",{"type":"'''","value":["Phuket International Airport"]},".

There is no accommodation available within walking distance of Manok Pier. There will generally be between ten and twenty tuk-tuks waiting to take you to accommodation for a fare of about 85 baht. \n\nKo Yao Noi has approximately 18 km of concrete and dirt road around it. The main road is a two-lane concrete road that rings the entire perimeter of the island, excluding the northernmost parts, where there are only dirt roads. There are several interior roads that are a combination of either sand\/dirt or concrete. \n\nThe most efficient way to get around the island is to hire a motorbike, and cost 200-300 baht per day. No licence is required and helmets are provided. Enquire at your hotel.\n\nTuk-tuks are available to give you lifts across the island. Simply flag one of these vehicles down as they drive past. Failing that, if you simply wait most locals will be happy to give you a lift. That may mean squishing onto a motorbike that already has three Thai adults and a baby on it.\n\nBicycles are also an excellent mode of transport and the main perimeter road around the island only has one large hill that must be navigated. The flat terrain makes it perfect for leisurely rides. Bicycles can be hired from Sabai Corner Bungalows or most accommodations.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Ko Yao Yai"]},"\nAs with Ko Yao Noi, the must efficient way to get from the Chonglad Pier to any accommodation is to make use of the tuk-tuks that will be awaiting your arrival. As Ko Yao Yai is larger than Ko Yao Noi, there is no exact fare, but anything over 150 baht is usually too much. \n\nOnce at your accommodation, most larger resorts will have motorcycles or bicycles for rent. Due to the terrain on Ko Yao Yai it may be wise to hire a automatic motorbike for travelling longer distances (>10 km) and using bicycles when travelling shorter distances. \n\nYou can also walk along the roads and either flag down a taxi or try to get a lift from the locals. Ko Yao Yai, like Ko Yao Noi is a very safe island and vehicles rarely travel above 15 km\/h, so hitch-hiking is not exactly a dangerous pursuit here.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nKo Yao Noi is mountainous in the centre and has beaches to either side. The east side has beaches suitable for swimming and snorkelling and the west is a picturesque blend of rice flats and mangrove trees. The island is a sanctuary for at least 4 species of hornbills, very commonly seen around.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=DragonHeart"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.dragonheartthailand.com"],["email=info@dragonheartthailand.com"],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+66 87 6265366"],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Indonesian Pinisi sailing boat with day cruises to surrounding islands, includes a full Thai-style buffet meal prepared on-board, fresh fish and Thai curries, music, lots of pillows, plenty of breeze and friendly crew."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Ko Yao International Diving School"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Ko Yao Noi"],["phone="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Diving at Lam Sai Village Hotel in Ban Laem Sai."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Koh Kayak Expeditions"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.kayakthailand.com"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=This small operation is fun and friendly and they help you design your own adventure away from the crowds."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nThere are some restaurant and food stalls on Ko Yao Noi and some more opened just recently, including really good seafood restaurants near the beach.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Cha's Noodle Shop"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Ban Prunai"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}," "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Coconut Island"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Along the main road between accommodations and the town"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Delicious seafood suited to budget travellers."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Good View Restaurant"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Daily, 10:00-22:00"],["price="],["content=Really good seafood."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Je t'aime Restaurant"],["url="],["email="],["address=21\/1 Moo 1"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=At the market just opposite the 7-Eleven"],["phone=+66 76-597495"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=09:00-22:00"],["price="],["content=French- and Danish-owned restaurant.
