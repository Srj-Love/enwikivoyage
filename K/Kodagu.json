Be prepared for a rough, winding and inexpensive ride. If you are coming from Bangalore\/Mysore, it is better to rent a cab from either city. This is recommended as public transport is not very effective in coorg district and the tourist attractions are spread across the district.

The fort offers a beautiful view of Madikeri. This fort is one of the most beautiful places to visit during the trip to Coorg. Initially this fort was built by mud and later on mud was replaced by the concrete stone, by the great king Tipu Sultan.\n\nAccording to an official explanation board at the site, Mercara, the headquarters of Coorg or Kodagu district, was founded by Prince Mudduraja of the Haleri Dynasty in 1681 CE, and was named after him as Muddurajanakeri -- which became \"Muddukayray\" and Madikeri over time. The British termed the place Mercara.\n\nMudduraja built a mud fort and a palace inside the fort, in the last quarter of the 17th century. This fort was later rebuilt of granite masonry, after it was captured by the \"Tiger of Mysore\" Tipu Sultan. Tipu named it Jaffarabad. In 1790, Doddaveer Rajendra took possession of the fort, and in April 1834, the British took control of it.\n\nBuilt on an elevated area, the fort has been described as an \"irregular hexagon\" on plan, almost confirming to the shape of the hilltop. There are six circular bastions at the angles, the entrance on the east is intricate and circuitious and guarded by three successive gates.\n\nMajestically looking over the area are two life-sized elephants made of mortar in the north-east corner of the entrance. A small but imposing church at the south-east corner was built in 1855 and is presently home to an archaeological museum (photography prohibited inside). The palace, renovated by Lingarajendra Wodeyar II in 1812-1814, presently accommodates government offices.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Raja's Seat"]},"\n\nAccording to legend, the kings of Kodagu spent their evenings here.

However, if you miss the sunset, an alternative is to visit the place early morning around 7AM. No tourist crowd or blaring speakers(which play during the evening). There is a toy train next to the park which offers a small ride for ten rupees. Park has an entry fee of 5 rupees. Try the chur-muri(bhelpuri) from one of the stalls near the park.

The famous Sri Bhagandeswara temple is located on the bank of the river over here. Pilgrims visiting Bhagamandala bathe (or sprinkle water on your head) in the Triveni Sangama, confluence of rivers and worship at the temple complex. Watch out for the wooden carvings in the temple. The subrahmanya idol in the temple is a swayambu and the temple was established by a rishi named Bhagamandala. The temple serves free lunch - you get rice, sambar and buttermilk.

It is about 48 km from Madikeri.\n\nThere is a shrine near the kundike and a big tank in front of it where devotees baths before offering prayers. There are 2 temples, a Shiva temple and with a rare and ancient Shiva Linga, and another temple dedicated to Lord Ganesha. This temple has a holy Ashwantha tree where, according to legend, the Trimurtis - Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh gave darshan to sage Agastya.\n\nLegends also has it that every year on Tulasankramana day (approximately on 17 October) Goddess Parvati appears in the Kundike as the sacred teerthodbhava. This occasion is marked by the sudden unsurge of water in the kundike and is considered very auspicious\n\nFrom Talakaveri, 365 steps lead up to the nearby Brahmagri peak, where the 7 great sages called the Sapta Maharishis had performed a special yagna.

Afterwards the mahout obliges eager tourists for elephant rides (Rs 100 per head, about five minutes, free for children below seven years) within the camp. In the mornings, all the elephants are offered a special treat of ladoos made of ragi and jaggery, each no smaller than a cannon ball!
