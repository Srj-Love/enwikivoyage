Though geographically close to Accra (25km), Kokrobite Beach feels as if it is a world away from the hustle and bustle of the big city.  It's an ideal place to spend a few days relaxing while soaking in the view of this tropical beach. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nAs with any beach, do not leave items unattended.  Valuables and electronics should preferably not be brought onto the beach.  Use your best judgement.

You may have to ask around in order to find your way to the tro-tros leaving direct to Kokrobite, as they depart from a back corner of the station.  As of December 2011, the one way fare was one cedi per person.  Kaneshie is roughly 25km from Accra, and the drive will likely take over an hour (possibly much more depending on traffic).  Most travelers to Kokrobite will want to disembark at the very last stop.  If in doubt, ask the tro-tro mate for \"Big Milly's.\"  \n\nAfter leaving the tro-tro, the most popular beachfront hotels are just a short walk down dirt roads.

Directly on the beach.  A good menu with international cuisine and breakfasts (7 - 15 cedis), a bar, and a cocktail & juice bar.  A range of rooms are available at various prices.

This hotel includes a large suite with bedroom, large bathroom, living room, and a balcony overlooking the beach.  Ocean views directly from the room's living room area (~50 cedis).  Korkor Inn is a good value for a beachfront view and seems to be a popular place for Ghanaians to eat and drink on busy days.  The kitchen can prepare jolof rice and fried rice (~10 cedis).\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Kokrobite Garden -"]}," "]},"Double rooms here were only 25 cedis and seemed like a very good value.  A very nice garden area with hammocks, tire swing, and gazebo.  The garden area is kept meticulously clean, and the rooms likely are as well.  The guesthouses are owned by a friendly Spanish couple who have young children.  Even if you decide not to stay here, it's still worth coming by for a meal.  They serve excellent Italian pastas and pizzas in the 12 - 20 cedi range.  Kokrobite Garden is a peaceful place to relax, and while not directly on the beach, it's an extremely short walk to the water.  http:\/\/www.kokrobitegarden.com\/\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nTro-tros to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Accra"]]}," leave from the paved road.
