The boundaries include part of the island of Flores, where there are actually even more dragons than on Komodo itself. As well as being home to the Komodo Dragon, also known as the Komodo Monitor, or Ora (to Indonesians), the park provides refuge for many other notable terrestrial species. Moreover, the Park includes one of the richest marine environments.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nKomodo National Park was established in 1980 and was declared a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["UNESCO World Heritage List"],["UNESCO World Heritage Site"]]}," and a Man and Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 1986, both indications of the Park's biological importance.\n\nThe park was initially established to conserve the unique Komodo Dragon and its habitat, first known to people outside the region in 1910 when Lieutenant Van Steyn van Hensbroek of the Dutch Infantry visited as a result of hearing tantalising rumours of their heroic size. Since then, conservation goals have expanded to protecting its entire biodiversity, both marine and terrestrial.\n\nThe majority of the people in and around the Park are fishermen originally from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bima"]]}," on the island of Sumbawa, and from Manggarai, South Flores, and South Sulawesi. Those from South Sulawesi were originally nomadic and moved from place to place in the region of Sulawesi to make their livelihoods.\n\nDescendants of the original people of Komodo still live in Komodo, but their culture and language is slowly being integrated with that of recent migrants. \n\nLittle is known of the early history of the Komodo islanders. They were subjects of the Sultanate of Bima, although the island’s remoteness from Bima meant its affairs were probably little troubled by the Sultanate other than by occasional demand for tribute.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Komodo Dragon 2.jpg"],["thumb"],["350px"]]},"\n\nThe number of terrestrial animal species found in the Park is not high, but the area is important from a conservation perspective as some species are endemic. Many of the mammals are Asiatic in origin. Several of the reptiles and birds are Australian in origin. These include the orange-footed scrubfowl, the lesser sulphur-crested cockatoo and the nosy friarbird. \n\nThe most famous of Komodo National Park's animals is the Komodo Dragon (",{"type":"''","value":["Varanus komodoensis"]},"). It is the world's largest living lizard and can reach 3m or more in length and weigh over 70kg. \n\nOther animals include the Timor deer, the main prey of the Komodo dragon, wild horses (kuda liar), water buffalo, wild boar (babi liar), long-tailed macaques, palm civets, the endemic Rinca rat (",{"type":"''","value":["Tikus besar rinca"]},"), and fruit bats. \n\nAlso beware of the snakes inhabiting the island, including the cobra and Russel’s pit viper, both of which are extremely dangerous.\n\nAs far as the marine fauna is concerned, Komodo National Park includes one of the world's richest marine environments.  It consists of over 260 species of reef building coral, 70 different species of sponges, crustaceans, cartilaginous (incl. manta ray and sharks) and over a 1,000 different species of bony fishes (over 1,000 species), as well as marine reptiles (including sea turtles), and marine mammals (dolphins, whales, and dugongs).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nTropical all year round, and both extremely hot and dry (> 40 degrees Celsius) during August and September.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Komodo_National_Park.jpg"],["thumb"],["350px"],["Typically remote and rugged landscape"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe ferry service (to and from the cities of Sape, on the eastern tip of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sumbawa"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Labuanbajo"]]},", on ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Flores (Indonesia)"],["Flores"]]},") drops off passengers on Komodo once or twice every week.

Beware of getting too close, and if you are visiting via the park's office (which you should), ask for a guide and stick close to him. Do not wander off or do anything without his consent. Komodos may approach the guest rest area during daily feeding time, but in this time, find a building (which are usually elevated) and stay clear from the railings. Komodos can and will jump to obtain food if necessary. Park rangers are usually present at these events and will deflect any Komodos trying to get in (which they can do).\n\nYou may be given a large pole with a split on the end, forming a \"Y\" shape. This can be used as a walking pole or for moving things on your path - however, if wild animals threaten, it can be used as a last form of defence (despite being hardly useful against Komodos). Overall, try keeping a watchful eye and steer clear of any wildlife.\n\nKomodos are extremely dangerous if close enough. They can run faster than humans (and accelerate very quickly), so best not approach if necessary. Jumping into water (as Komodos are often found near the beach too) doesn't help either, as they can swim faster than humans, can dive, and can also swim against strong currents (in fact, sometimes Komodos are found on neighbouring islands, suspected of swimming there). \n\nZoologists formerly believed that the main problem was the dragon's septic bite from the rampant bacteria residing in their mouth. More recently theories have been put forward that the Komodo Dragon is actually venomous, and that the biggest problem when bitten is shock and massive blood loss due to the ferocity of the bite. In either case, getting bitten is not a good thing. \n\nThe absence of crocodiles on Komodo Island (due in part to a lack of suitable habitat) leave the Komodo dragons with no natural predators. \n\nYounger Komodos may live in trees. While not as dangerous as their parents, they can still jump off suddenly and cause panic. Snakes, monitor lizards, and other animals are also present and may cause minor problems.\n\nSaltwater crocodiles are not present on Komodo Island but they may be present on the surrounding islands and in the ocean. So take extra caution in any area with estuaries and river mouths because the islands are within the natural range of that species of crocodile. It was once believed by Indonesian natives that monitor lizards (including the Komodo dragon) were capable of warning humans of a crocodile's presence, but don't count on this for your safety.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Bali"]]}," - the Island of the Gods is two hour's flying time away and is a popular combination trip with Komodo.
