Kongsberg was founded in 1624, after silver was discovered in the hills. The Danish-Norwegian king recruited German miners to the mines. As result Kongsberg in the 17th century was a \"German\" town. Which was the second largest in Norway, only rivaled by ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bergen"]]},". The mining ceased in 1957. Kongsberg today is a centre for high-tech industry. Kongsberg also host the Norwegian mint, and all Norwegian coins since 1686 are produced in Kongsberg. Kongsberg was from its foundation a key town in Norway, thanks to the rich silver sources in the hills. Today merely a small town, but it's rich past is seen for instance in Konsberg church, still Norway's largest church by number of seats. Kongsberg and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Røros"]]}," Churchs are the two monumental churches of the 1700s. Unlike most other Norwegian towns, Kongsberg is not a part but resides in the valley next to the mines. The silver mines is a web of some 1000 km tunnels and 300 shafts dug out during some 300 years of production, and is a key historical monument in this district. The mines cover an area of 30 square kilometers, which also includes about 80 dams supplying water to the faciliteis. Unlike most mines, in the Kongsberg mines large chunks of pure silver was often found deep in the hard rock. More than 1 million kilograms of pure silver were extracted from these hills. The deepest shafts went 1000 meters under ground. At its peak the mines employed some 4000 people and was Norway's largest enterprise before the industrial era. A small train brings visitors a few kilometers into the mines (May 18 to August 31).\n\nKongsberg is the gate to the great Numedal valley. There is also a nice winter sport resort in the hills of Kongsberg.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Oslo"]]}," Airport Gardermoen"]}," ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.osl.no"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["OSL"]]},")Driving distance: about two hour.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Sandefjord"]]}," Airport Torp"]}," ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.torp.no\/"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["TRF"]]},")\n",{"type":"===","value":["By rail"]},"\nTrains between Oslo and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kristiansand"]]}," passes Kongsberg.
