Konstanz was an important trade centre and a spiritual centre. At the council of Konstanz in 1414-1418, a papal election was held, ending the papal schism. Konstanz attempted to join the Swiss Confederacy in about 1460, but was voted down. Due to its proximity to Switzerland, Konstanz was not bombed during world war II and its historic old town remains intact. It is a historic city with a charming old town, and could be called the jewel of the region.\n\nThe tourist information centre is located in the train station.

Zurich Main Station has excellent connections to the rest of Switzerland as well as Italy, Austria and France.\n\nThe other Konstanz train stations are located in the city districts of Petershausen, Fürstenburg and Wollmatingen. \n\nMost places around Lake Constance can be reached by train: Romanshorn, St. Gallen, Stein am Rhein and Schaffhausen can all be reached with a change in Kreuzlingen (which is the \"Swiss suburb\" of Konstanz, just across the border), whereas Friedrichshafen, Lindau and other German places around the lake require a change in Radolfzell and take a long time - the boat can often be quicker. Bregenz in Austria is best reached via Switzerland - change in Rorschach and St Margrethen.\n\nTo reach Konstanz from the rest of Germany is time-consuming.
