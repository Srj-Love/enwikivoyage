The poet and Sufi thinker ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rumi Rumi"]}]}," also settled in the city during this period.\n\nDespite rapid growth in recent years, and the arrival of many students from out of town in the Selçuk University (Selçuk Üniversitesi), founded in 1975, Konya still retains the air of an Anatolian provincial town. Even though the influx of tourists from the west has increased considerably visitors are still left in peace, and do not have to suffer the hassles they get in Istanbul. On the downside perhaps is the fact that fewer people speak English (or any other foreign language), but the natural hospitality of the people of Konya usually makes up for that. Be careful with taxi drivers, who sometimes have no scruples about ripping off visitors to their city.\n\nKonya is also one of the most conservative cities in Turkey with more women covering their heads with headscarves. Dress modestly if you want to fit in with the local population, although not many people will bat an eye lid if you choose not to.\n\nThe city lies on a totally flat ground, with the sole exception of a small hill called ",{"type":"''","value":["Alaattin Tepesi"]}," in the very centre of the city—which is actually a man-made hill, erected during the Seljuk period so noble residents could easily watch the city below from their palace. Almost nothing remained of the palace and the hill now serves as the central park, which is a quite pleasant and shady one.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nTurkish Airlines ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.turkishairlines.com\/"]},", Anadolu Jet ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.anadolujet.com\/aj-EN\/index.aspx"]}," and Pegasus Airlines ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.flypgs.com\/"]}," offer flights from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Istanbul"]]}," to ",{"type":"'''","value":["Konya Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["KYA"]]},"), located about 18 km north of city, off the highway to Ankara.

On the way to the centre, Havaş buses also stop at the bus station (",{"type":"''","value":["otogar"]},"), which may be useful to hop on a tram to the hotels in the northwest of the city, around the university campus and the highway to Istanbul.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:KonyaTrainStation.jpg"],["thumb"],["Old train in front of train station"]]},"\n\nUntil recently trains constituted a slower alternative to travelling by bus or car.

Although not offering the charm of travelling while enjoying the landscapes slowly changing on the other side of the window, these new trains makes it much more practical to reach Konya. As of now there are fours trains every day, however more depatures will be added in the near future.\n\nFrom ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Istanbul"]]},", there are still two nightly sleeper services (via ",{"type":"[[","value":[["İzmit"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Eskişehir"]]},"-Enveriye station, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kütahya"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Afyon"]]},"), the ",{"type":"''","value":["Meram Express"]}," departing at 7:40PM from Haydarpaşa station and arriving in Konya just before 9AM the following day.

Fares starts at 35 TL for second class, 77 TL for first class sleepers.\n\nThe Konya railway station is located in the suburb of Meram, some distance from the centre; it is easy enough to take a taxi from the station to the centre, but surprisingly some of the taxi drivers are not familiar with the locations of the main hotels. Alternatively it is about 30–40 minutes' walk to the city centre, given you don't have heavy backpacks.\n\nAs all the rail works is not finished yet, expect (temporary) cancellations of many inter-city train services.

A number of minibuses depart from outside the bus station, of which some stop in or near Alaaddin Tepesi: these take about 30 minutes and should cost less than 2 YTL.
