Exploration by river and lake, and commerce facilitated by the large sternwheelers that plied the many large lakes emphasize this point. Virtually untouched until the gold and silver rushes of the mid-1800s, a few settlers who fell in love with the area remained after the fortunes faded, and provided the roots for the communities as they exist today.\n\nIn the early days of British Columbia the Kootenays were geographically isolated from the rest of the province. The ",{"type":"'''","value":["Canadian Pacific Railway"]}," built the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Kettle Valley Railway"]}," to link the area to Vancouver, and also to waylay any plans of US annexation, an area the Kootenays had stronger physical ties to at the time. The ",{"type":"'''","value":["Crowsnest Highway"]}," which bisects the region was completed in 1949, further solidifying the link to the rest of the province. \n\nThe Kootenays are comprised of several roughly north-south mountain ranges and the valleys between. From east to west there are the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Rocky Mountains"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["Purcell Mountains"]},", and the ",{"type":"''","value":["Selkirk"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["Monashee"]}," ranges of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Columbia Mountains"]},". There are also several very large lakes in this area, the largest of which were formed by hydroelectric dams. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Lake Koocanusa"]},", which gets its clever name for the fact it stretches across the international border, was formed by the Libby Dam in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Idaho"]]},". ",{"type":"'''","value":["Kootenay Lake"]}," which is about 100km long with a 35km western extension to the town of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nelson (British Columbia)"],["Nelson"]]}," is a natural lake, though the southern floodplains were diked to reclaim agricultural land. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Arrow Lake"]},", (which is divided into north and south portions at the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Needles"]]},"-",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fauquier"]]}," ferry) is almost 200km long, stretching from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Revelstoke"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Castlegar"]]},". It was formed by the Keenlyside Dam.  \n\nToday, this area is comprised of many small towns, and as with most of British Columbia, this area favors travellers looking for natural beauty and outdoor adventure, rather than cosmopolitan cities. It is particularly renowned for alpine skiing, due to the large amounts of snow the area receives, with several large lift-accessed resorts and a booming cat skiing industry.\n\nThe climate is generally warm and sunny in the summer, and cold and snowy in the winter. Winter driving conditions can be treacherous at times, so do take caution.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nThe ",{"type":"''","value":["de facto"]}," language in this area is English.
