Another way is to take a train on the Howrah-Chennai route, get down at Vizianagaram (50 km before Visakhapatnam from Kolkata side) and catch share taxis to Koraput which takes 3 hours and costs around 250 Rupees per person.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By road"]},"\nKoraput on the hills can be reached from most places in either Odisha or Andhra Pradesh by travelling up a heavily forested winding road (also called a ghat road), with many sharp hair-pin bends. The road trip from either state is quite scenic. It is the most travelled and well maintained. If travelling in the early morning or late evening, you definitely will spot wildlife feeding along the road, or even spot the odd carnivore. There are forests of sandalwod trees all the way.\n\nThere are 2 ways to get to Koraput from Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram:-\n\n1.   The route from Visakhapatnam traverses along Pendurthi, Kottavalsa, Srugaravarapu Kota (S.Kota), Araku, Araku Valley and Koraput. This route is a bit long and is well paved till at least the Andhra Pradesh-Odisha border. As ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Araku Valley"]]}," is a hill station and major tourist attraction in the northern parts of Andhra Pradesh one can get decent accommodation in one of the 3 Andhra Pradesh Tourism Department operated resorts or private hotels at Araku Valley. And from there one can travel to Koraput after a refreshing night in the laps of nature. The road from S.Kota to Araku Valley is a ghat section or a winding mountain road which has 9 hair pin binds on route 1.\n\n2.    The other route to Koraput from Visakhapatnam goes via Vizianagaram, Gajapathinagaram, Rambhdhrapuram, Salur, Pottangi, Simliguda, Sunabeda (HAL) and Koraput. From Vizianagaram the trip to Koraput is around 150 km and the journey time is usually around 4 to 6 hrs depending on the road conditions, traffic conditions and the weather. The road till the Andhra Pradesh and Odisha border is well maintained on the Andhra Pradesh side.\n\nThe journey to Koraput is scenic and as mentioned above and one will definitely see wolves, foxes, and if one is lucky enough hyenas and bears on the roads. Coming to the scenic part, it is a very scenic to watch but really dangerous for the inexperienced driver who never drove earlier on winding ghat roads (mountain roads), especially trying to avoid ditches, potholes and all other obstacles and the very rude and ignorant bus drivers of the Odisha State Transport Corporation.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThere is a Government of Odisha Tourist Office at Koraput Club, Telephone: +91 6852-250318.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Area landmarks"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=HAL Engine Plant"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address=Sunabeda"],["lat=18.739"],["long=82.829"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=NALCO Alumina Refinery"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address=Damanjodi"],["lat=18.773"],["long=82.9165"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=National Aluminium Company Limited (NALCO) is Asia's largest integrated aluminium complex, it draws its raw material, bauxite, from Panchapatmali mines nearby, NALCO has a smelter at Angul."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Jeypore"],["alt=Marked on the map"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Town with feudal heritage and presently a commercial nerve centre near Koraput"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name= Sabara Srikhetra Jagannath Temple"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat=18.8108"],["long=82.7091"],["directions=Mid of Town"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Tribal Museum"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Behind the Jagannath Temple"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=It educates tourists about the culture and heritage of the tribals."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Duduma Waterfalls"],["alt=Matsya Tirtha"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat=18.5128"],["long=82.4409"],["directions=88 km from Koraput"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=The Machkunda River forms the 175 m high waterfalls, with facilities for generation of hydroelectricity at Machkunda Power Station.
