Later the unified country fixed its borders approximately where the present North Korean border lies against China and Russia.\n\nThe Korean nation was occupied and annexed by Japan from 1910 until the end of the second world war in 1945. Shortly thereafter it was divided by the allied forces and a devastating civil war began in 1950 that ended three years later. Since then it has remained divided into the Communist North with a hereditary dictatorship and (since the 1980's) a Democratic South with a free market economy.\n\nThe two countries have been in a state of 'cease fire' for the past 60 years, however the relationship has always been strained and risk of another devastating war is always a possibility.\n\nThe people of Korea are known as Koreans, and are ethnically homogeneous throughout the peninsula. There are no other ethnic groups historically associated with living here, although more recent times have seen immigration into South Korea from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South East Asia"]]},". Ethnic Korean communities can also be found in neighbouring China, whose border area with North Korea is home to the largest Korean population outside Korea.\n\nAlthough culturally both countries share the same heritage, the different paths both have taken in the past 50 years means that you have to refer to the Wikivoyage pages for South Korea and North Korea to gain a relevant understanding.\n\nThere are not many practical examples of the Korean nation as a concept. The two Koreas occasionally team up together at the Olympics under a unified flag, and there is a joint industrial zone in the North Korean city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kaesong"]]},". South Korea regards all citizens of North Korea as Korean citizens with a right to live in South Korea.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Unification flag of Korea.svg"],["thumb"],["Unified Korean flag used for the Olympics"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nThe language of Korea is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Korean"]]},". Since the division of the country into two very different states after the Korean war, differences in language have increased with South Korea importing many English words into its vocabulary. In addition, it's rare that people from the North and South have the opportunity to interact. Nevertheless, the language is still very much mutually intelligible between Korean speakers.\n\nSouth Korea has been a strong ally of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United States"]]}," since the Korean war, and the US variety of English as a second language is highly promoted and a key requirement for everyone in the education system. Japanese and Mandarin are also spoken by many in the tourism industry.\n\nNorth Korea will, unfortunately, present you with few chances to speak to North Koreans. Typically your guides will be English speakers, although most of the general population may have learned either Russian or Mandarin Chinese.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nEntering North Korea is relatively difficult, and as a rule can only be done via a state sanctioned tour group from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beijing"]]},". Typically flying from Beijing to the capital ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pyongyang"]]}," is the most common method, although potentially road or rail crossings across the border are possible.\n\nEntering South Korea is relatively easy for most nationalities and can be done most commonly by air globally, or by sea from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Japan"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russia"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China"]]},".\n\nIt is worth noting that there are ",{"type":"'''","value":["no practical options"]}," for directly travelling between the two Koreas.

There you are not allowed to exit the room through the \"wrong\" door to the other side. \n\nNorth Korea has extremely heavy restrictions on personal and group travel. Expect only to travel as part of a state-sanctioned tour with a highly prescribed itinerary.\n\nSouth Korea has many options for travelling around the country, with an extensive air, train and road network.
