[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Mena-asia_default_banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Korigad"]}," (also called Koraigad, Koarigad or Kumwarigad) is a fort located about 20 km away from Lonavla in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pune (district)"],["Pune district"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Maharashtra"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["India"]]},". Its date of construction is not known but likely predates 1500. It is about 929 m above sea level[1]. The closest village is Peth Shahpur.\n\nThis fort was incorporated into his kingdom by Shivaji along with the forts of Lohagad, Visapur, Tung and Tikona in 1657. On March 11, 1818, Col. Prother tried to take over this fort but even after a prolonged siege could not make any headway. Finally on 14 March, by igniting the stored ammunition by means of a loose cannon ball he succeeded and this fort went to the British[2].\n\nNow because of the Mulshi dam, a lake has formed close to the base of the hill on which Korigad stands[3]. There are two lakes on the top of the fort[3]. A temple to its patron goddess Koraidevi[4] also exists along with several smaller temples to dedicated to Vishnu and Shiva. The former has been recently renovated and has a 3 foot high Deepmala(tower of lamps)[2].The interesting part of the fort is that its wall is completely intact and one can walk along its entire perimeter(about 2 km)[2]. Its massive gate is also intact. Several ruins of older structures within the fort still exist. It has six cannons - the largest of which called the Laxmi Toph is located near the Korai devi temple[2][4].\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Western Maharashtra"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Korigad"]]}]
