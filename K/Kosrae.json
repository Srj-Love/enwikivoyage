It is a requirement of all government staff to be able to speak and write English, and the staff at hotels, restaurants and rental car companies speak English. As a legacy of WW2, some of the older residents speak Japanese.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nContinental Micronesia (now United Airlines) has been flying to the islands of the western and central Pacific since 1986. Numerous East and West bound flights make Kosrae easily accessible even for short visits.\n\nThe Kosrae International Airport, in Tafunsak Village is located at the north-western corner of Kosrae. The air terminal features handicraft shops, food service, and car rental agencies.\n\nKosrae's airport currently handles direct 737 flights that leave Honolulu on Monday and Friday mornings around 5:30AM, and after crossing the international dateline, and traveling a total of around 8 hours, you arrive the next day, Kosrae local time at around 11:10AM. During this trip you will have two 45-minute stops, one in Kwajalein and the other in Majuro. Kosrae also receives flights from Guam on Monday and Friday that leave around 9:30AM. There are two 45-minute stops, one in Chuuk and one in Pohnpei along the way, and the flight arrives in Kosrae around 3:55PM local time.\n\nIf you are traveling to Kosrae from Europe, the common flight paths are via Manila (Philippines), Seoul (Korea), or Tokyo (Narita Inl, Japan), and then connecting through Guam.\n\nFrom Australia the most common way is to take a Continental flight from Cairns to Guam, which then has a short connection time onto Kosrae.\n\nFrom the U.S. mainland, the common flight path is via Honolulu, but you can also take a direct flight to Tokyo from many U.S. cities, and then travel via Guam.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nTaxis are available on Kosrae. They are very cheap ($2 to $5\/person), but you get what you pay for, and they are rather unreliable. They're OK if you don't mind long waits, or walking if they don't arrive. Rental cars are relatively modern and normally in good condition. Most are US standard auto, left hand drive, and cost around US$50 per day, or right hand drive automatics can be arranged for around $40\/day. Most hotels can pre-arrange them.\nMost of the roads are flat and run around the edge of the island near the ocean.
