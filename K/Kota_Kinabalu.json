Recent economic growth has resulted in urbanisation of the city reaching adjacent districts of Penampang and Putatan with a total population of almost 800,000. Recent growth and importance is due to being the administrative capital, a major transportation hub, growing port, manufacturing hub, growing tourism as well as being the major gateway into Sabah and East Malaysia. Kota Kinabalu was granted city status in 2000 becoming the sixth city and also currently the sixth largest urban\/metropolitan area in Malaysia.\n\nKota Kinabalu was previously known as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Jesselton"]}," while under ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United Kingdom"],["British"]]}," colonial rule from the late 1800s until 1963 when the British left and after Sabah became part of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Malaysia"]]},". Most of the town was destroyed due to bombings during World War II hence there are not much pre-war historical sites around the city. Before the British arrived, the area was also known by a number of other names such as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Deasoka"]}," (below the coconut tree), ",{"type":"'''","value":["Singgah Mata"]}," (pleasing to the eye), ",{"type":"'''","value":["Api-Api"]}," (fire!) and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Gaya Bay"]},".\n\nThe people of KK consists of Chinese, Kadazandusun, Bajau, Brunei Malays, as well as significant migrant population from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Indonesia"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Philippines"]]},", many of which are naturalised citizens.

This is where most hotels, travel agents, transportation bases and most of the action are found. Most of the city centre lies on reclaimed land due to shortage of land in the area as it is blocked by Signal Hill (Bukit Bendera). Areas which lie within the city centre includes Kampung Air, Api-Api, Segama, Sinsuran, Bandaran Berjaya, Gaya Street, KK Port and towards south are Karamunsing, Sembulan, Tanjung Aru and Sutera Harbour.\n\nDue to lack of land in the city centre, other important commercial areas have sprouted outside CBD. Some of these areas have been long in existence as small townships (pekan) such as Luyang, Inanam and Menggatal and in adjacent districts of Penampang  (Donggongon) and Putatan while some are recently developed residential-commercial areas such as Alam Mesra, Kingfisher and 1Borneo near Menggatal; Lintas, Penampang Baru and Bundusan.\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["climate"]}," in KK is characterised by uniform year-round temperature of 32°C (avg. high) and 22°C (avg. low).

Almost all locals are able to understand and speak at least basic English. There is an emerging community of educated locals who are able to converse in fluent English and, in fact, speak English as their first language. As almost 50% of Kota Kinabalu's residents are of Chinese descent, visitors who speak Chinese will not encounter any language problems. The main dialect spoken by Kota Kinabalu's Chinese community is Hakka, but Mandarin and Cantonese are also widely understood and spoken. Unlike many other Malaysian cities with substantial Chinese communities such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kuala Lumpur"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Penang"]]},", the Hokkien dialect is not in common use among Kota Kinabalu's Chinese residents. In addition to English and Chinese dialects, Bahasa Malaysia (Malay) is also widely spoken, albeit with a distinct Sabahan flavour. Some residents also speak the languages of native Sabahan races such as Kadazandusun and Bajau, but these are not commonly used in daily conversation.
