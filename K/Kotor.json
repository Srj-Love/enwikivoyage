[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Kotor banner.jpg"],["unesco=yes"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.opstinakotor.com\/ Kotor"]}]}," is a coastal town in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Montenegro"]]}," with a population of 23,500. It is well known for its stunning architecture and amazing natural setting.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Kotor, Montenegro.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["320px"],["Kotor Bay"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nKotor is situated in a most secluded part of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boka Kotorska"]]}," bay, in the northern part of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Montenegro"]]}," coast. It has developed around ",{"type":"'''","value":["Stari Grad"]}," (local language for \"old town\"), the city's old town and best known landmark, which is listed with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["UNESCO World Heritage List"],["UNESCO World heritage sites"]]},". The bay is the deepest natural fjord in the Mediterranean Sea, and the scenery around it (including the steep mountains which come almost to the waterfront) is spectacular.\n\nThe Stari Grad is fully walled (with the mountain acting as one of the walls).  There are four gates offering access to the town: The Main Gate, along the Bay, the North Gate, the South Gate, and a smaller New Gate.  There are no cars allowed in the Stari Grad, nor are there standard road names in the Stari Grad.  Although all buildings are numbered, it is best to use landmarks for directions.  Generally, the squares are named for the church in their center, and directions either relate to the closest square or the closest gate.  The most well know and obvious landmark is the clock tower, just inside the main gate, in the main square.\n\nThere are abundant banks and ATMs throughout the Stari Grad.  ATMs will often dispense as few bills as possible.  For example, a withdrawal of €150 will probably produce 3 €50 bills.  Many people will refuse to make change from large bills, so it is advised to withdraw an even amount, to avoid €50 bills, or small amounts at a time.  Banks are not open on Sunday or Holidays.  Travelers cheques are generally not accepted, even by banks.  Not all restaurants or shops will accept credit cards so it is best to ask before hand.\n\nKotor, and the entire Kotor Bay has long been a vacation and second home destination for many Europeans, including English, Irish, and Scottish.  After Serbian, English is the common language, and most waitstaff and hotel staff can communicate in some English.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Cerkiew św.

Road traffic was formerly diverted to alternative road over Trojica hill above Kotor. It is still possible to travel via this very curvy mountain road, so you might travel from Budva to Kotor a bit longer. From this hill you can enjoy beautiful views not only of the tiny countryside villages, but also of Podgorica (when approaching from Cetinje), and also Kotor bay.\n\nBe aware that when driving in Montenegro that the locals drive very aggressively and think nothing of overtaking across white lines on steep bends. Be careful. There is also a great deal of road building underway and the safety considerations are a little less onerous than those in more developed countries. Don't panic.\n\nAs in many places, taxis may or may not have a meter.

Enter the old town via any of the three gates then explore the maze of narrow passages between the stone houses.\n\nParking space in the city center is very hard to find, so use your car only when you have to. Be careful where you park, sketchy tow operators target tourists around the old city. You can look for a free parking space away from the old city and then walk.\n\nThere are no sandy beaches in Kotor, and water is not of premium quality for swimming. The best solution is driving to the Jaz or Trsteno beaches on the Budva riviera, some 20 km from Kotor.
