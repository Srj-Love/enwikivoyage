Legend has it that it was built on the cave of a dragon whom the mythical King Krak had slain. However, the first official mention of the name was in 966 by a Jewish merchant from Spain, who described it as an important centre of trade in Slavonic Europe.\n\nThrough trade with the various rulers of Europe, it grew from a small settlement in 1000AD to a large wealthy city, belonging to the Vistulans. However, through the 9th and 10th centuries, it fell under the influence of the Great Moravians, then the Bohemians, before being captured by the Piast Dynasty of Poland. In 1038, Kazimierz the Restorer made Kraków the capital of Poland.\n\nIn 1241, the city was almost entirely destroyed by Tatars. It was rebuilt to a design that remains largely unchanged to the present day. However, after more successful attacks by the Mongols in the late 13th century, Kazimierz the Great set about defending the city. Walls, fortifications, and the original Wawel Castle were added. The University was also established. King Kazimierz established the district of Kazimierz for Jews to live in free from persecution. This area remained mainly Jewish for centuries until the Nazi occupation.\n\nThe 16th century was Kraków's golden age. Under the influence of the joint Polish-Lithuanian Jagiellonian dynasty, Kraków became a centre of science and the arts. In 1569, Poland was officially united with Lithuania and as a result government activity started to move to Warsaw. King Zygmunt III officially moved the capital in 1609.\n\nHowever, the 17th century was a return to troubled times for Kraków and Poland. After being invaded by Russians, Prussians, Austrians, Transylvanians, Swedes, and the French, it went through a phase of various forms of political control. These included being part of the Duchy of Warsaw, established by Napoleon, and becoming an \"independent city\". However, it mostly fell under the sphere of influence of the Austrian Habsburg Empire, in the province of Galicia.\n\nIn the First World War, Józef Piłsudski set out to liberate Poland and the Treaty of Versailles (1919) established an independent sovereign Polish state for the first time in more than 100 years. This lasted until the Second World War, when Germany and the USSR partitioned the country, with German forces entering Kraków in September 1939. Many academics were killed and historic relics and monuments were destroyed or looted. Concentration camps were established near Kraków, including Plaszow and Auschwitz. After German withdrawal, the city escaped complete destruction and many buildings were saved.\n\nIn the Communist period, a large steel works was established in the suburb of Nowa Huta. This was seen as an attempt to lessen the influence of the anti-communist intelligentsia and religious communities in Kraków. In 1978, UNESCO placed Kraków on the World Heritage Sites list. In the same year, the Archbishop of Kraków, Karol Wojtyła, was made Pope John Paul II.\n\nThe communist government collapsed in 1989 and Kraków has undergone another period of regeneration, with historic buildings being restored.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Economy"]},"\nKraków is the most popular tourist destination in Poland and this supports much of the local economy.

There is a large manufacturing sector as well, especially in steel (owned by Mittal), pharmaceuticals and tobacco, mainly as a legacy of the communist era.\n\nUnemployment is lower than average (5%) for the rest of the country (9%) and it is considered an attractive investment opportunity, especially for those buying real estate.

Another local specialité is ",{"type":"'''","value":["oscypek"]}," - cheese from Tatra Mountains.\n\nIf you want to try Polish cuisine for outstandingly good-value prices (a big lunch for one person for about 8 zł) then find a 'Bar Mleczny' (a ",{"type":"''","value":["milk bar"]}," - a kind of cafeteria very prevalent in Communist times so called because it serves no alcohol). You can find one on the right side of ul. Grodzka (if you are going from Rynek Główny). They offer classic Polish food such as 'kroketka'.

Basically, it's these two gruff Polish men who, every night from 8PM-3AM, set up a fire grill outside of their van (parked in front of the market east of the Old Town near the train bridge) and grill kielbasa. For 8 zł, you get your sausage, roll and a squirt of mustard, stand at the perch nearby and chow down with the locals in-the-know. It is delicious, especially after a night of exploring Kraków's bars. A fun experience free of the usual tourist crush and off the main path (ul. Grzegórzecka, opposite ul. Blich)\n\nBy far one of the most popular street foods in Kraków is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["zapiekanka"]}," which is a large open-faced baguette with baked toppings (traditionally cheese, mushrooms, and a lot of condiments like ketchup or garlic sauce).

Take a small spoon with sugar, put some Sliwowica on it and fire it. Let the sugar melt down for a while (10–30 seconds). Then, mix the flaming sugar with the rest of the drink.

When winter comes around, it moves underground into cellars all around the city.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Cafes"]},"\n\nKraków is not only full of cozy cafes, but is also said to be the place of the first cafe founded in Europe. Most cafes offer good espresso and something to nibble at a very reasonable price. As a rule, international-looking places are much more expensive.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nAs the number of tourists to Kraków increases rapidly, accommodation prices are rising. Try to avoid hotels and hostels located in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kraków\/South"],["Nowa Huta"]]}," district; most of them are former shelters for part-time industry workers and the district is quite distant from the city center.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Campsites"]},"\nThere are few campsites in Kraków, most of them closed in colder months.

In the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kraków\/Old Town"],["Old Town"]]}," there are some reasonably priced and some pretty luxurious and expensive.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Private Accommodation"]},"\nA good way to stay in Kraków is to rent private accommodation. You can usually get a one bedroom for €60-€90 a night, located in the Old Town. There are two agencies opposite the main railway station offering rooms. If you hang around the street outside the agencies for a while, some landlords will approach you and make an offer. This saves you the commission, but may be a bit unsafe.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nLike the rest of Poland, Kraków is generally a very safe city with strong police presence. \nViolent behavior is rare and if it occurs it is most likely alcohol-related. While pubs and clubs are generally very safe, the nearby streets may be scenes of brawls, especially late at night. Try to avoid confrontations. Women and girls are generally less likely to be confronted or harassed since the Polish code of conduct strictly prohibits any type of violence (physical or verbal) against women.\n\nFollow standard city travel rules: don't leave valuables in the car in plain sight; don't display money or expensive things needlessly; know where you're going; be suspicious of strangers asking for money or trying to sell you something.\nPickpockets operate, pay attention to your belongings in crowds, at stations, in crowded trains\/buses (especially to\/from the airport), and clubs.\nIn any case, do not be afraid to seek help or advice from the Police (",{"type":"''","value":["Policja"]},") or the Municipal Guard (",{"type":"''","value":["Straż Miejska"]},"). They are generally helpful, polite and in most cases speak at least basic English.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Racism"]},"\n\nAs a result of German and Soviet terror, modern Poland is a very homogeneous society. Even though quite a few Asian and African migrants have settled in the larger cities (including Kraków) in the last couple of years, it is still quite rare to see non-Caucasians on the Polish streets. If you are a non-white traveller do not be surprised (or alarmed) if some people (especially young children) stare at you with curiosity. The overwhelming majority of Poles is composed of warm, hospitable people who are often curious to learn more about other cultures. Racist incidents are extremely rare, but, just like anywhere else in Europe, have taken place. If you are unfortunate enough to experience racism or too much curiosity, it is important not to get yourself involved in a confrontation. Walk away instead.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Scams"]},"\n\nAs in any major tourist city there are people trying to take advantage of travellers. Generally, use common sense and follow simple precautions. Below is a list of the most common scams:\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Bar scam"]},"\n\nA common scam is for two or three women (can be Polish\/Foreign, not always attractive) to walk up to men in Main Market Square or surrounding streets and ask for directions to a particular street or square. If you respond \"I don't know\" they will ask you if you have a map, introduce themselves and say \"will you join us for a drink?\". They might also ask you questions like 'are you here alone?', 'do you know anyone in Kraków?', 'do you speak Polish?', all to try and determine if you are a tourist and if you have any connections to Kraków. They will then lead you to a nearby nightclub where you will be presented with a huge bar bill for ordering just a handful of drinks. Several bars\/clubs on ul. św. Tomasza, Sławkowska, Floriańska and św. Marka have been linked to this scam, i.e. Club Saxon and Hard Candy.\n\nSimilar scams occur regularly with various approaches, even through starting to talk at a table in McDonald's. The clubs you are taken to do not always look like a public building, looking very residential from the outside. Note that it is legal to charge outrageous amounts for drinks. The best thing to do is to always be on your guard when in such a situation, and to make sure you check the prices before you order anything (including the prices of the drinks the girls are having). If you are in the unfortunate instance you are presented with an extremely large bill, call the police by phoning 997 or 112, and make sure the bartender hears that you are doing that.\n\nHard Candy and Club Saxon both do these scams openly. If you try to leave they have large Russian mafia-looking men rough you up. The city has not done anything about this and Hard Candy has been in operation for 10 years.\n\nIn general, bear in mind that, just like anywhere else in Europe, it is unusual for girls or women to approach strange man\/men and even less so to invite him\/them for drinks. If the situation looks to good and fortunate to be true, then probably it is.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Hotel scam"]},"\n\nA few Kraków visitors have been victim to the hotel scam.  After a long day of travel, the victim is awakened when their hotel room phone rings. It's the receptionist apologizing for the late hour but asking to verify credit-card details. The victim reads them out and drifts back to sleep. As Kraków guides know, there is a growing black market for stolen credit card numbers, and the chances are that even before the victim remembers this late night conversation there will be high charges to contest, possibly even ending their vacation early.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Taxi scam"]},"\nWhen using a taxi always ask for a price for your journey before you leave. Scam taxis have been found to operate near to the main railway station. They are legally registered as \"transportation services\" and charge €20\/1 km. With regular taxis prices are limited by law, and the pricelist is easily visible. It should be around 2,30 zł per kilometer, with an initial fee of 7 zł (first kilometre included in price). Reliable licensed taxi companies include: Taxi Barbakan, Taxi Dwójki, Lajkonik Taxi and Taxi 19191. While it is legal for \"transportation services\" to charge people as much as they like, their prices must be clearly displayed and must be clearly stated when you ask the driver. If you do not agree with the price, do not use the service. The best way to get a reliable taxi is to call them by phone (you can do it by yourself or ask hotel staff to do it for you).\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Currency exchange scam"]},"\nAnother recent, but already quite common scam involves private currency exchange booths at and around the railway station, on the way from the railway station to the Old Town and on the Royal Way, which are the areas most commonly visited by tourists right after they arrive to Kraków. Look very closely what the BUY rate is when you exchange your currency into PLN, ask for the exact rate IN WRITING. Do not let the clerk point on the chart with rates, insist on quoting the rate for you beforehand on a piece of paper. Very often the rate is displayed not on an electronic board, but with digits on small tiles; it may happen that a small tile with a zero is partially slid right under the comma in the BUY rate, so e.g. instead of 3,45 PLN the actual rate is 3,045. This is difficult to notice and the clerks do not accept any complaints after you receive your money. Victim may lose up to 20% of the exchanged amount. Remember the rule of thumb - spread between the BUY and SELL rates should not exceed 2-3% of the BUY rate on the main currencies (EUR, USD, GBP) and 5% on secondary currencies (CHF, JPY, SEK, NOK). Stick to banks (even if the rate is slightly worse, it is still perfectly acceptable) or large currency exchange points. Ask at your hotel.\nThie practice is definitely unfair and on the verge of legality. It has been described and condemned in local press. However, if the tile with 0 is visible at least in half, the booth owner may escape responsibility, as your acceptance of the rates is assumed.\nThe currency exchange point at the railway station usually operates at rip-off spreads. AVOID at all costs, unless you are in a big hurry or selling PLN.\nActually the best rates (with less that 1% margin) can usually be found in several exchange offices of Sławkowska street.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Consulates"]},"\n\nSome of these are only honorary consulates.
