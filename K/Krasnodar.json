It is located to the east of the Black Sea.

Hitchhiking is also common. Trams, buses, and trolleys are more popular modes of travel because they are public and relatively cheap with a single pass costing 15 rubles (~$0.40 USD) and a monthly pass for 400 rubles (~$13 USD) as per single type of transportation. Some people choose to opt out of using trams, buses and trolleys because they have a tendency to be packed during rush hours of morning and evening as well as not sticking to schedule during times of heavy rain or snow. For times like these, taxis and marshrutkas are always available at a higher fee. One in three native Krasnodarians own a personal vehicle.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" “Krasnaya St.” - main street of the city, along which many of the interesting spots are located.
