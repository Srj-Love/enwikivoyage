Due to its high position it was possible to communicate from there to other castles of the country by using light\/fire signs. After the Ottomans finally defeated the castle, it was reconstructed, but later on lost its importance. Therefore, by 1920, the city consisted of only the castle and a few streets outside the castle (the current bazaar streets). Almost all of today's city was built during the last 50 years and does not look very plenty.\n\nTourism has just begun in Kruje so that the local people don't yet know how to deal with tourists. It therefore often occurs that they try to sell things like food and drinks for prices 2-3 times higher than in Tirana. Stay calm and negotiate the price before you order. (People sometimes try to raise the price if they know you are from a country which they think is \"rich\".)\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nThere are many buses to Kruje from Tirana.
