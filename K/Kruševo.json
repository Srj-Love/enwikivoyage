Historic Kruševo was one the center of the Macedonian Ilinden-Uprising. Today the main celebrations of the National holiday on  the 2nd of August are held here. Kruševo is the centre of the Vlach minority in Macedonia.\n\n\n\nHidden up in the mountains between the woods, Kruševo has managed to preserve a genuine appeal. The town has the same layout as a century ago and around 80 traditional houses are preserved, so it is a good place to admire and learn about traditional architecture. Unfortunately, being so small and isolated the town has had problems coping with the transition. The town is a winter skiing center with paths good for beginners.\n\nAs of 2002, the population of Kruševo county was 9684, composed of 64,8% Macedonians, 10,53% Vlahs, 19,3%Albanians, 3,25%Turks.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nKruševo is famous for being one of the first balkan republics  and the highest town in Macedonia. It developed into a large prosperous town in the 18th century. It was inhabited by Macedonian Vlachs(",{"type":"''","value":["Macedo-Vlahs"]},") and Macedonians from the Reka region in Western Macedonia called Mijaks. Both suffered a lot from Ali Pasha Janinski, an Albanian aristocrat, and his army, so they gathered in Bitola asking for help from the Turkish administration. The governor offered to let them stay in Bitola and the Vlachs who were traders and goldsmiths accepted, but the Mijaks and the Vlachs who had large herds of sheep and were used to living in the mountains, didn’t have anything to do in Bitola, so they were allowed to found their own city. It was a good combination, as the Vlachs were rich and the Mijaks were the best builders in the Balkans, and both groups had a very sophisticated sense of aesthetics, so they created the wonderful Kruševo we have today. \nOn 2nd of August 1903 the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ilinden Uprising"]}," started in Kruševo, the biggest rebellion of the Macedonians against the Turks. On the freed territory ",{"type":"'''","value":["Kruševo Republic"]}," was established which lasted for 10 days and Nikola Karev was proclaimed president.
