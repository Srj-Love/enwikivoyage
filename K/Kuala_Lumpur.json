A cab hailed off the street is more likely to use the meter than one that stalks tourist spots.

",{"type":"'''","value":["Pavilion Kuala Lumpur"]}," is a recent addition to the cluster of shopping malls in this area and houses a wide range of international retail brands in an ultra-modern complex.

It is also the location of the largest single department store in Malaysia, SOGO Kuala Lumpur which is located at a landmark site on Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman, one of the best known shopping streets for locals in Kuala Lumpur.\nSeveral popular malls lie outside the Golden Triangle. The ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Kuala Lumpur\/Bangsar and Midvalley"],["Bangsar and Midvalley"]]}]}," areas are home to some of the best shopping malls in Kuala Lumpur, namely the ",{"type":"'''","value":["MidValley Megamall"]}," and the adjacent upmarket ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Gardens"]},", the more cozy ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bangsar Village"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bangsar Shopping Centre"]}," in Bangsar.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Markets"]},"\nDespite the onslaught of malls, Kuala Lumpur still offers some Asian tradition with traditional shopping streets and markets.

This district is also the best place to hunt for souvenirs, especially in ",{"type":"'''","value":["Central Market"]},", a former produce market which has been converted into an art and craft market. It is also known as Pasar Seni in Malay.\n\nThe Little India near Jalan Masjid India offers various fabric for use. Most of the fabrics are imported from countries like Indonesia, India and China while some are locally produced. Indonesian traditional ",{"type":"'''","value":["batik"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["songket"]}," are traditional fabric commonly found in Central Market.

You may be interested to buy ready made ",{"type":"'''","value":["baju kurung"]}," or ",{"type":"'''","value":["baju kebaya"]}," (the traditional Malay blouse). For peace of mind, buy from the bigger stores. Some Thai handicrafts are also sold here, alongside handmade Malaysian wooden souvenirs.\n\nSince 2000, the Ministry of Tourism of Malaysia has kick-started the mega sale event for all shopping in Malaysia. The mega sale event is held thrice in a year—in March, May and December—where all shopping malls are encouraged to participate to boost Kuala Lumpur as a leading shopping destination.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["SeeDistricts"]]},"\nMalaysian food is amazing, making Kuala Lumpur an excellent place to eat as it hosts cuisine from all around the country and beyond.

Along with full-blown curries, these places also serve ",{"type":"''","value":["roti canai"]}," (generally RM1 each), a filling snack that is almost half chapati, half pancake but certainly wholly delicious. It is served with dhal and curry sauce.\n\nShopping malls' food courts provide cheap Malaysian food in more hygienic conditions, although the prices will be a little higher. Lot 10 shopping mall in the Golden Triangle has a collection of 20 street vendors who were invited to relocate in the food court.

In fact, these stalls have also become night hangouts in their own right, and many outlets have installed wide-screen projectors and TV where they screen football matches. Most outlets are open 24 hours. They are found all over the city and are a wonderful part of the Malaysian night scene.\nAnother trend that has hit Malaysia is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["kopitiam"]}," fad, a more upmarket version of the traditional Chinese coffee shop. These mostly open during the day and offer some of the best tea and coffee and light meals and snacks like ",{"type":"''","value":["nasi lemak"]}," (coconut flavoured rice with fried anchovies and peanut) and the ever popular toast with ",{"type":"''","value":["kaya"]}," (coconut curd, used as a spread). If you prefer Western style coffee, there are many coffee outlets in Kuala Lumpur: most of them are part of international and local chains like Starbucks, Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf and San Francisco Coffee.

Increasingly, newer & better ones are opening in the Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman\/Chow Kit and Jalan Ipoh areas, the so-called growth areas in the city centre. An example is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Tune Hotel - Downtown KL"]}," on Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman (Chow Kit area). If you are willing to take the 10 minute LRT to the main attractions, then hotels can be found for as little as US$16 per night with free WiFi, A\/C, and breakfast often included. \nIf you are arriving on the overnight buses (arriving at 4AM) from the east coast islands, buses will stop at Hentian Putra in the Chow Kit area. \n",{"type":"'''","value":["Mid-range"]}," hotels are comparatively poor value in Kuala Lumpur, and it is worth it to spend a little extra (or look a little harder) for a true luxury hotel on the cheap.

Other luxury hotels include The Hilton, Le Meridien, Shangrila and JW Marriot. Prices will vary seasonally.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nCrime is not rampant in Kuala Lumpur. The perception of crime is high, but in recent years the Malaysian police have managed to reduce crime significantly in and around urban Kuala Lumpur. Reports of violent crime against foreigners are uncommon but instances of pick pocketing and bag snatching have risen in recent years.\n\nKuala Lumpur is generally very safe for travellers (it is locals who are often the targets of crime), but be wary of over-friendly locals trying to con you. Police presence, particularly around tourist areas and at night has increased in recent years.\n\nWalking in the city is usually fine but, as anywhere, caution must be exercised, especially if alone. Indeed, your greatest danger whilst walking will be sidewalks that end abruptly in massive holes, or impassable 6 lane roads that you must cross. Snatch thieves can be rather ruthless: women have been knocked unconscious by bag snatchers on motorbikes. If this happens to you, let go of the bag rather than be dragged several metres and risk injury. Hold your bag away from the street side and try not to appear flashy if possible. Be wary in alleyways or parking grounds that appear dark and deserted, as petty thieves with knives or firearms might mug you.\n\nDuring the rains, pavements and streets become small rivers and crossing a street can be an adventure. Pavements become as slippery as ice so wear proper footwear.\n\nBe careful of a poker scam that involves friendly locals. They normally target lone tourists in popular tourist places. It starts with a friendly approach and an invitation to their home to chat and learn about your country. Then comes poker, accumulated losses and the loss of your cash and jewellery. Such scams can also happen through couchsurfing.\n\nThe bogus cop scam is usually run by Middle-Easterners. You will be stopped by \"plain-clothed police officers\" on the pretext of checking your travel documents. You will be brought to a secluded area in the process and made to handover your wallet. Should you be stopped, you have the right to insist that you be taken to the nearest police station before saying\/showing anything.\n\nMalaysian law requires that visitors ",{"type":"'''","value":["carry their passport at all times"]},", and both police and \"RELA\" (civil volunteers) carry out spot checks for illegal immigrants.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\nTap water in Kuala Lumpur is heavily chlorinated and thus safe, but unfortunately the pipes that carry it may not be.

However, the haze comes and goes, and varies greatly from year to year: it was terrible in 2006, but non-existent in 2007, and had started again in 2008 and very clean after 2009 onward.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Respect"]},"\nKuala Lumpur is ostensibly a liberal city and wearing revealing clothes will rarely cause major problems. However, avoiding overly revealing clothes goes a long way towards blending in. \nMany mosques and temples require covering up, and you will get more respect from officialdom if you dress up a little. Many places of worship including all mosques will require you to take your shoes off before entering.\nWhen eating with hands rather than cutlery, do not eat with the left hand in public as it is considered impolite.\nIf you can speak just a few words of the four main local  languages, namely Bahasa Malaysia, Chinese (especially Cantonese), Tamil and English, it will ingratiate you a lot with the locals.\nAlso, while you may drink in pubs, restaurants and bars, public drunkenness is not tolerated. You will be more vulnerable to getting robbed or will find yourself in the back seat of a police car.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\nInternet cafés are quite plentiful in Kuala Lumpur and you can find them in most shopping centres.
