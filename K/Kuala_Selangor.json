[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Mena-asia_default_banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Kuala Selangor"]}," is a town in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Selangor"]]}," State.\n\nLiterally, Kuala means rivermouth in the Malay language, and thus this is a small town where the Selangor River (Sungai Selangor) meets the sea. It was the old royal capital of Selangor prior to moving to Klang, and finally to Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThis small town was conquered by the Dutch when they invaded Selangor in 1784. It is located well off the normal tourism route and hence, still maintains its traditional \"kampung\" (village) atmosphere.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nVisitors can board Selangor Bus No. 141 from Medan Pasar Bus Hub in Kuala Lumpur. The bus departs half-hourly from KL between 6.30am and 7.30pm, and takes 2 hours (++) to reach the bus terminal at Bandar Malawati, Kuala Selangor. (The last bus for the return trip from Kuala Selangor to KL is at 7.45pm) The one-way fare is RM7.30.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Directions to Medan Pasar Bus Hub"]}," \nThe bus hub is about 100m north of Central Market. From Masjid Jamek LRT, walk 100m southeast along Jln Tun Perak before turning right into Lebuh Ampang. After walking another 100m, you will see the bus shelter next to a grey \"clock tower\" in the small square. \n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Directions from Bandar Malawati Bus Terminal"]},"\nThe terminal is in Bandar Malawati, which is about 1km southeast of the town centre. You can then take a RM5 taxi ride \/ local bus to the town centre of Kuala Selangor (alternatively you can take a 15-20min walk). \n[The bus terminal is also served by Cityliner buses from Klang]\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\n\nIts a one hour journey by cab. The cab might also not be able to pick up a passenger on the way back, so expect fares to be high. For comparison, the distance from KL to KLIA is about 80km and a one hour journey. Taxis typically want RM 70 for a trip to the airport. So you would expect something similar, or higher for this trip. You might be able to negotiate a good deal if you book the taxi for a return trip.\n\nHourly hire rates for a small taxi (red\/white) is about RM35 an hour if you would like to book one for the duration of the trip.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nMake your way towards Sungai Buloh exit from North-South highway and follow the road signs towards Kuala Selangor. Alternatively if you are starting your journey from Klang, you can drive towards Kapar and head straight from there towards Kuala Selangor. Either way, the journey should not take longer than 80 minutes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nKuala Selangor is a relatively small town and has no public transport system. So really the only options are a sweaty walk or a take a taxi. (Apart of course from the tram going up and down Bukit Melawati.)\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Bukit Melawati"]},", known as Bukit Selangor to the locals, has an indelible mark in the history of Selangor. The locals built a fortress on top of the hill in the 19th century to defend Selangor from enemy attacks at the river mouth and provide a vantage point to monitor ships entering and leaving the Straights of Malacca. The fortress was captured by the mighty Dutch armies and was used as their base to launch attacks on Selangor to capture the luxurious tin trade. The fortress was renamed Fortress Altingsburg after the name of the Dutch Governor General at that time, Governor General Alting.\n\nThe fortress was later destroyed during the Selangor Civil War (1867-73) skirmish between warring factions fighting for tin rich areas. Sultans of various areas teamed up with different Chinese gangs and the war resulted in a bloody end only to be 'saved' by the British Resident, who was requested by other Malay Rulers to mediate talks to put an end to the futile feud. \n\nAlthough the war has ended years ago, there are several remnants from the past that appeal to historical buffs and visitors alike. A couple of leftovers cannons and foundation stones are hugely popular with visitors who are fascinated with its historical values. Some of the foundation stones are believed to be used for executions for locals who dared defied the Dutch armies. Bukit Melawati also has a lighthouse and several old colonial houses built during the British era. Some of the lesser known attractions on the hill include the Poisoned Well that was filled with poisonous mixture of latex and juice from bamboo shoots and reputed to be used to execute traitors by lowering them into the well drench in poison and the Royal Mauseleum that is the final resting place for the first three Sultans of Selangor.\n\nThe view from on top of Bukit Melawati is panoramic. On a clear day, visitors can see the Malacca Straits. The sunset view at this hill is rated among the nicest in the country. A little fishing settlements can be viewed from the hill as well. The sight of fishing boats rounding up their fishing trips and laying the nets down are a welcome sight after the hustle of the cities. From the hill visitors can also see the entirity of Kuala Selangor Nature Park, a great birdwatching site which is located at the foot of the hill.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:monkey.jpg"],["thumb"],["Monkeys on Bukit Melawati"]]},"\n\nThe Chinese nicknamed the hill as \"Ma Lau San\" which loosely translated as Monkey Hill.  This is because the hill is swarmed by several families of Silver -Leafed Monkeys and Long-Tailed Macaques. Visitors come in droves to feed the monkeys with peanuts and vegetables that can be purchased from vendors around the area. The monkeys are generally quite gentle. However do take caution as these animals are born in the wild and may be dangerous if provoked.\n\nVisitors can choose to walk up the hill or opt for a tram that runs up the hill (note: weekends only) and only costs RM3 per adult and RM1 for children. The tram will bring visitors round the hill and to the fresh water fish park. Visitors can choose to alight at any point that they wish and resume the ride on another tram.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nGo and see the Fireflies (",{"type":"''","value":["Kelip-Kelip"]}," in Malaysian) at the Firefly Park in Kampung Kuantan and Kampung Bukit Belimbing in the evening.
