There are full facilities including toilets and BBQs. There are four relatively easy jungle trails, but the main attraction used to be the Orang Utan Training Centre - where orphaned and rescued Orang Utans are rehabilitated and taught how to survive in the wild. But after a tourist got bitten by one of these apes they were removed. By December 2006 Matang had no more Orang-Utans, but please update if this changes. The centre also houses other animals like Crocodiles and Hornbills in large enclosures."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Lodging"]},"\nAccommodation is availablein the form of chalets and a hostel.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Camping"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Backcountry"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Sarawak"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinepark"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Kubah National Park"]]}]
