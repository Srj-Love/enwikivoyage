Between 1248 and 1352 Kuyavia, the southern part, was connected with Dobrzyń Land, the northern part of this region, which was later lost to the Teutonic Knights. In 1287 Kuyavia became a separate duchy and was conquered by the Teutonic Knights in 1332 who controlled it until the Treaty of Kalisz in 1343. As part of the Kingdom of Poland, the area retained its traditional division into two separate parts, The Inowrocław Voivodeship and the Brześć Kujawski Voivodeship. During the 17th century, Dutch and Frisian colonists founded numerous towns with individualistic architecture in this region. They developed independent village communities and brought their agricultural knowledge to the region, specializing in the cultivation of lakes and rivers in moorland and fallow land. Following the First Partition of Poland in 1772, the northern part and following the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 also the southern part of this region was annexed by Prussia.\nBetween 1807 and 1815 the region was a part of the Duchy of Warsaw and later split between Prussia and the Russian Kingdom of Poland. In 1918 it became part of the Second Polish Republic, was occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II, and was restored to Poland in 1945. \n\nSince 1999 it is included within the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nThe people of Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship speak standard Polish with little if any local dialect.
