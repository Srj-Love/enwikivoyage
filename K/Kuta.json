It has long been a popular stop on the classic ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Banana Pancake Trail"]]}," backpacking route in South East Asia. Back in the 1980s they used to talk about the three Ks: ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Katmandu"]]}," in Nepal, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Khao San Road"]]}," in Bangkok and Kuta. Today Kuta still attracts some hardcore backpackers as well as families and tourists from all over the world, and is most notably a playground for young visitors from Australia.\n\nDue to the ever increasing popularity of Bali, Kuta is continually developing, and is not short of unsightly, poorly planned buildings. It can come across at times to be chaotic, overcrowded and congested. However, amongst all the mayhem this place somehow works, and hundreds of thousands of visitors enjoy their time in Kuta every year.\n\nInfrastructure has come a long way in Kuta, although it is still insufficient for the amount of visitors who stay in the area. Some side alleys still have significant potholes and road rules still don't mean very much. Most roads are constantly busy with motor scooters, metered taxis and private cars. Instead of using signals, locals and the seasoned travellers honk their motor vehicles to signal overtaking or squeezing into a tight spot near you. Oftentimes cars fold in their side mirrors when negotiating narrow single lanes with parked vehicles. Now you can access free wifi in local convenience stores, restaurants, cafes and hotels. There are half a dozen prepaid mobile phone sim cards available everywhere with competitive top up plans. Touts will persistently try to get you to buy something from them, whether you're walking on the streets or seated in a restaurant.\n\nThe five km long sandy stretch of Kuta is arguably the best beach front in Bali. The beach is safe, partially clean, well-maintained, although the beach vendors remain annoying pushing massages, hair braiding, cigarettes and surf boards. The long wide stretch of sand is often full of sunbathers and although most of the serious surfers have moved on to newer pastures, there are still plenty of surf dudes around at most times of the year, and especially so during peak season. As you move north along the beach to first ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Legian"]]}," and then ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Seminyak"]]}," and Petitenget it becomes progressively quieter and less frenetic.\n\nThe area of south Kuta closest to the airport is more correctly known as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Tuban"]},", but this name is rarely used.\n\nOnce the sun goes down, Kuta is the rough and ready party zone of Bali, even after the tragic events of 2002. Even the most hardened of party animal will find something to please them on Jalan Legian at night.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Tourism Information Offices"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["JI Bakungsari, Tel: +62 361 751660 ext 145"]},{"type":"*","value":["Ground Floor, Century Plaza Building, JI Benesari No7, Tel: +62 361 754090"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Bali-Kuta-Map.png"],["thumb"],["right"],["450px"],["Map of Kuta"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bali#By plane"],["Ngurah Rai International Airport"]]},", also known as Denpasar International Airport (DPS), is in fact directly south of Kuta, about 15 minutes away by taxi. More information about the airport is in the main ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bali#By plane"],["Bali article"]]},".\n\nThe prepaid fare from the airport to Kuta is Rp 50,000. If you don't have too much luggage, you can save some money by walking 200 metres out of the airport area, and take a metred taxi from a company that does not pay service fees to the airport authority and is therefore not allowed to enter the airport to pick up customers. For example, a metered taxi from Bali Taksi (+62 361 701111) will run to about Rp 20,000 for the same trip. Before putting yourself through all that though you might wish to ask yourself whether it is worth it to save just $3. You can also catch a bemo from outside the airport to Kuta for Rp 5,000-10,000.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nKuta is reached by the main Jalan Ngurah Rai bypass from points north (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Denpasar"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sanur"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ubud"]]},"), and south (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jimbaran"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nusa Dua"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Uluwatu"]]},".

To avoid traffic-related frustrations, the best option is a combination of walking in small lanes and using metred taxis or a rented motorbike for longer excursions.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nTraffic jams are a constant hassle here and especially so when it is raining. It is often best to park your car before you reach downtown Kuta, and walk in. The area downtown is only about one and a half kilometres in length and half a kilometre wide but when stuck in traffic you might easily spend 30 minutes or more to travel these short distances.\n\nThere are some designated parking areas in the middle of Kuta (usually Rp 5,000 for an unlimited stay) including a large one on Jalan Legian near the top of Poppies II. There are also public parking bays on Jalan Pantai Kuta right beside the beach, but these can get very busy.\n\nFinding a rental car company is easy in Kuta, especially in Poppies I and Poppies II. A small rental car starts from Rp140,000 with third party insurance. Add another Rp100,000 or so for a comprehensive cover. Check your rental contract for specifics before signing. The rental car can be driven to your accommodation for pick up.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\n\nMetered taxis (",{"type":"''","value":["taksi berargo"]},") are ubiquitous on the streets of Kuta and are a relatively cheap and reliable way to get around, especially at night. Avoid any taxi where the driver refuses to put the meter on. This is increasingly rare but you will still find the odd taxi driver who is stuck in a 1990s timewarp.\n\nThe largest, most reputables and most reliable taxi operators are Bluebird and Bali Taksi. Sometimes these taxis are not available at night in the immediate vicinity of discos and bars as other smaller companies may have exclusive arrangements with these businesses. However, the more reputable and reliable taxis can be found easily by walking a little up the street. It would be in your interests to seek out a Bluebird taxi in this situation.\n\nBe aware that, since BlueBird and Bali Taxi have the best reputations, a number of other drivers have started to try and make their taxis look very similar, using blue vehicles with names like Taxi Bali, or a logo that's similar to the BlueBird. Look very carefully, sometimes at first glance the imitators can be quite convincing.\n\nIf you wish to use a taxi ensure the destination is clear with the driver before you enter the taxi and that the driver will be using the meter.\n\nIf the driver does not agree to use the meter seek an alternative taxi.\n\nHaving entered the taxi ensure the driver understands the destination requirement and turns on the meter (",{"type":"''","value":["argo"]},"). At the end of the journey pay the amount showing on the meter. Do not accept any requests from the driver for extra payment or surcharges of any kind other than the payment of tolls or parking fees, these are the responsibility of the passenger, not the driver.\n\nThe driver may not provide change if you only have large notes, ensure you obtain smaller notes prior to travel or stop on-route, otherwise you will most likely have to ",{"type":"''","value":["round-up"]}," the payment and not receive any change.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By motorbike"]},"\n\nThose with a sense of adventure should try hopping on the back of a local scooter. They are always looking for a passenger, making negotiation easier and more successful. This type of informal transport is called an ",{"type":"''","value":["ojek"]}," and is fast and cheap.\n\nYou can choose to rent a scooter for your stay.  There are literally thousands of scooters available for rent: these should cost no more than Rp 35,000-50,000 per day rental, and between Rp 30,000-45,000 per day for rental of a week or more. Insist on a helmet for the motorcycle, for both your own safety and because wearing a helmet is a legal requirement in Indonesia; you ",{"type":"''","value":["will"]}," be stopped by the police and fined for riding without a helmet.
