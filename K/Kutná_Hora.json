Journey times vary from 52 minutes to 1 hour 12 minutes.\n\nThere are buses roughly hourly from Prague leaving the Florenc, Černý Most or Háje bus station, see the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/jizdnirady.idnes.cz\/autobusy\/spojeni\/?lng=E&f=Praha&t=Kutna%20Hora time schedule"]},". Some are direct and some require an interchange. The fare is around CZK 70. Journey time is one hour twenty minutes direct, one hour forty minutes indirect.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nThe town is about three kilometers in length, so it is possible to explore Kutná Hora on foot. This isn't particularly rewarding though, as most of it is residential and the attractions (with the exception of the Kostnice Ossuary) are concentrated at the other end of town from the train station.\n\nThere is a local bus system with buses arriving to meet the trains. If you want to return to the train station from the historical core, take the bus that says \"Hlavni Nádraží\" on the front window. A single ride for adults costs 12 crowns and will leave you right at the train station, though the schedule only has two buses an hour, so walking might actually be quicker depending on your timing.\n\nThere is also a very convenient, privately operated \"tourist bus\" that constantly drives between the main train station (Hl. N), the ossuary, and St. Barbara for 35CZK per person. The drivers wait until the bus (which is really a mini van) fills up to at least 3 guests, then drives off. He's usually waiting outside the Ossuary, driving people to the St. Barbara Church.\n\nThere is also local train connecting historical core (station \"Kutná Hora město\") and the main station \"Kutná Hora hlavní nádraží\". It meets the arrival (and departure) of nearly all the express trains, leaving a five-minute gap for transfer.  (This could be a problem if you want to leave luggage at the main station, since (1) there are no left luggage facilities at the local station and (2) if you see both the Ossuary and the city, then it may be convenient to arrive at one station and leave from the other.)  You can buy the train ticket from the local station \"Kutná Hora město\" directly to Prague. The price will be about the same as the price from \"Kutná Hora hlavní nádraží\" to Prague.  This isn't Prague, though, so expect only minimal understanding of non-Czech languages from the ticket sellers.  There are no ticket machines or similar amenities.\n\nThere are also taxis: usually one or two will meet the train, otherwise they can be a little difficult to find. Unlike in Prague, it is safe to hail them in the street: they won't overcharge. A taxi ride from one end of town to the other is about 80 Kč.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Additional Information"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" When you arrive at Kutná Hora you may get the Number 1 bus to Kutná Hora Město (Kutná Hora Town Center) or wait at the station for the train that goes to Kutná Hora Město.

When you leave the station, go right until you reach the first intersection (about 3min walk). Then turn left and walk for another 5–8 minutes (it depends on how quickly you walk) and you will come to the church on your left (more details to follow) and the Ossuary on your right. At the Ossuary you need to pay a fee to enter (50Kč) and another one to take pictures (30 Kč).\n\nAfter you finish with the Ossuary, you can walk to the town center but it will take 35–45 minutes. Go back to the main road and turn right. You're now about 2,5 km from the town center.\n\nAll you have to do is to follow the road signs until you reach the main attractions in the town center. You cannot miss the  St. Barbara's Cathedral and, April to November, the Hrádek - Czech museum of silver.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Suggested Itinerary"]},"\nArrive at the Kutna Hora Hlavni Nádraží, walk to the Ossuary. Take a bus, tourist shuttle, or walk to St. Barbara's church. Follow the church's exit out to explore the entire city—it leads you directly into the town. There's a lot of cafes, restaurants, souvenir shopping, art museums, and the famous Kutna Hora underground mine tour. At the end of your city exploration, walk to the Kutná Hora Město (Kutná Hora Town Center) Train Station and head back to prague via a short \"shuttle\" train to Kutna Hora Hlavni Nádraží.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Sedlec Ossuary chandelier.JPG"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Chandelier made of human bones, Kostnice Ossuary"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Kostnice Ossuary"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.kostnice.cz\/"],["email=info@kostnice.cz"],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=327 561 143"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Zamecka 127.  This impressive bone church, is better known as the Sedlec Ossuary. The beginning of its story date back to 1278, when Henry, the abbot of Sedlec was sent to the Holy Land. On returning, he brought soil from Golgotha and sprinkled it on the ground here. As a consequence, the burial ground was considered holy and became extremely popular. In 1511 a chapel was constructed to house the bones from abolished graves. The chapel is open to the public, and contains the bones of about 40000 people, arranged by František Rint in 1870. Rint's work includes an enormous chandelier including every bone in the body, and a crucifix style arrangement near the main altar. The ossuary is open 8am - 6pm (April - September), 9am - 5pm (October, March) and 9am - 4pm (November - February). Closed on 24th December.
