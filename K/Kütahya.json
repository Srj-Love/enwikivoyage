In the 14th and the early 15th centuries, it was the seat of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Germiyanid"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["Germiyanoğulları"]},"), one of the Turkic petty kingdoms that rose to power after Anatolia was overrun by the Mongol hordes in the 13th century and the central authority of Seljuks disappeared as a result. Of the more powerful ones of such principalities, the Germiyanid land was later annexed into the Ottoman state—which itself started as a neighbouring frontier principality to north—in 1429. Regardless, Kütahya kept its prominence, and for a long time—more than four centuries, to be precise—was the capital city of the Ottoman ",{"type":"''","value":["eyalet"]}," of Anatolia, which covered more or less half of what is today Asian Turkey. \n\nHowever, the luck of Kütahya ran out with the coming of the age of steam and trains. For laying out their new route from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Istanbul"]]}," into Anatolia and beyond, the engineers understandably favoured the open steppes in the north to the mountain fastness that Kütahya resides on. The location of the following railroad-related industries to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Eskişehir"]]}," sealed the deal, and assured that Kütahya should now take a backseat to its northern neighbour's regional prominency—as Eskişehir sparkled, Kütahya waned.\n\nToday, with its 215,000 residents, and its modern heavy industry (so much so that for many years Kütahya was rated as having the worst air quality in the country, although things seem to get better nowadays), in addition to its traditional trade of ",{"type":"'''","value":["tilemaking"]},", Kütahya could be considered as one of the bigger cities in Turkey.
