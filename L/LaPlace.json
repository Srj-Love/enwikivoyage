[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["LaPlace"]}," is an Unincorporated Community on the east bank of the Mississippi River in the historic \"German Coast\" section of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Acadiana"]]}," region of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Louisiana"]]},". It is just a short distance west of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Greater New Orleans"]]},".  LaPlace is the largest community in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["St. John the Baptist Parish"]]},".\n\nAround Mardi Gras time, the hotels in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Orleans"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Metairie"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kenner"]]}," may be booked up, so LaPlace is a good alternative, 20 minutes drive from Kenner and Metairie, about 30 or 35 minutes from New Orleans.\n\nUntil Katrina hit this was a relatively small town, had a few high schools, a Wal-mart, some strip malls, and one or two good places to eat. Not to mention the two drive thru-daiquiri shops, and now (2007) new business' are opening up everywhere you turn, and the Wal-mart has been upgraded to a Super-Wal-mart!  If you come to LaPlace, though,  there will not be much to do. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Woodland Plantation, old plantation house.
