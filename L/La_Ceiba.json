Within the city and to the airport there are standard taxi rates.  It is 20 Lempiras (June 2008) per person within the city limits.    This jumps to 25 Lempiras after dark and goes up the later you are out. A ride to the ferry dock is 50 Lempira per person.  As fuel prices have increased what constitutes a \"downtown\" trip has shrunk.  Do make sure you know the fare before you get in the cab, particularly if you are leaving downtown for the port or the airport.  Prices are generally quoted per passenger except from the airport. Don't be surprised if your driver stops to pick up additional passengers.\n\nThe streets are very common to every single citizen. Since its a small town, everybody knows where everything is. Know the name of your destination or have it written down (for the more obscure destinations, include the barrio or colonia in which it is located). However, you can also say names of important buildings and the taxi driver will most likely know what you're talking about.\n\nThere are plenty of buses in La Ceiba. The cost is usually around 10-15 Lempiras. A bus will continue to pick up people until it is full. Be advised that if a bus doesn't stop to pick you up it's because it has reached capacity. Just stand at the side of the road and flag one down when you see it coming. The people who ride the buses are locals that want to travel in a more economical manner. Hondurans are generally very friendly, still, it's a good idea to watch your belongings like everywhere else in the world! If you're not showing off your cash and valuables, you should be ok.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nExcellent options with children are:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Cuero y Salado Wildlife Refuge."]},"  You take an old train through the pineapple fields to a beautiful lagoon.

Here they offer adventure in the form of canopy tours (i.e. ziplines from platform to platform built into the treetops) and whitewater rafting (very intense during the rainy season) among other activities.\n\nAsk a local about nightly football games at the Municipal Stadium located about 4 blocks east of Parque Central.  The East side of the stadium has a much more lively atmosphere than the family outing-like setting of the West side; the tickets are a slightly more expensive but certainly worth it for a more authentic experience.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Villas Pico Bonito"],["url=http:\/\/www.villaspicobonito.com"],["email="],["address=Km 7 Carretera de Yaruca"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=La Ceiba, Honduras"],["phone=504 449 0045"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Villas Pico Bonito, Jungle Eco Resort on the spectacular Rio Cangrejal.\nA hidden paradise in Pico Bonito National Park with self contained lodges for rent.

The souvenir shop with the largest selection in La Ceiba, including a good variety of local art and artisan work, is the Rain Forest located just to the northwest of the stadium in Colonia El Naranjal. Local hammocks can be purchased around central park at a reasonable price, but start your negotiations at half the asking price.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nA great place for tourists and ex-pats alike is Bar Expatriados. It's been a while since I've lived in La Ceiba but any cab driver or local will know it's roof top downtown location (in Barrio El Iman at the end of Calle 12). The former owners, Mark and Maureen have returned to Canada but the new American owners, Joe and his wife Michelle, are helpful and friendly.  The menu is typical American\/Honduran. Great burgers and imported\/domestic beer. The cost for a meal is expensive compared to the non ex-pat places but much cheaper then a fancy restaurant. A night of dinner and drinks for 2 will run you about $30USD\n\nThe Mango Tango is another popular moderately priced restaurant along the beach strip in the Zona Viva (Calle 1 along the beach).\n\nRicardos on Avenida 14 de Julio is also delicious and well priced and serves some of the best food in Central America and has the awards to prove it.  They are at the top end of the price scale in La Ceiba but still half what you would expect to pay for the same plate above the Rio Grande.\n\nA bit outside of town toward the airport the ex-pat owned and operated Iguana Bar & Restaurant serves local seafood and open grille beef speciality dishes on the beach at more moderate prices.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["drink"],["name=Expatriates Bar & Grill"],["url="],["email="],["address=12a Calle, South of city center"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=504 440 1131"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Good grilled food, cold beer and friendly staff."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nThere are good quality hotels in La Ceiba, including the Quinta Real, La Quinta, Hotel Paris, the Aurora and, between the airport and downtown, the Coco Pando.

There are only a couple & both are surrounded by dark streets after 7PM, offering very little. There is a hostel located in La Ceiba called Banana Republic but it has problems with security, most recently (date unknown) involving a series of break-ins.\n\nVia radio, they communicate with a personal cab driver that will offer you transportation around the city as well as (for $20US as of Oct 2007) the 20 mile ride north to their jungle lodge, located in the Pico Bonito national rain forest (see DO above).\n\nLastenia Hotel is nice and cheap place to stay, they have a really tiny swimming pool upstairs, a cafeteria next door, you can get a room with a\/c or fan, depending on your budget. 3 people can stay for about $15.00 a night and they now provide transportation to Bus station, airport or Ferry terminal for about $3.00 per room, not per pax, per room.\n\nHotel Gran Ceiba is another seemingly good quality hotel, but travelers who stayed there in February 2009 were robbed by someone with access to the hotel keys, so buyer beware.\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Hostal"],["alt=La Ceiba, Honduras"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=La Mokitia Ecoaventuras Guesthouse\/Hostal in La Ceiba, with tropical gardens, big yard, Tv hall, book exchange, Free Wireless Internet Service,  Our friendly, bilingual, staffs are ready to help you with information and reservations. \nNO check out time.\nInf.
