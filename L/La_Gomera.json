Most people fly to Tenerife South, then get a ferry from nearby Los Cristianos.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\t \n\nBy ferry from Los Cristianos in Tenerife to San Sebastian de la Gomera or directly to Playa Santiago or Valle Gran Rey. \n\nSince the smaller company Garajonay Express was forced out, Fred Olsen Ferry fares have rocketed. During the boat-war, fares on both were around €25 return from Los Cristianos. Now, even an advance day return costs around €80 for the short 40-minute crossing. Although residents of the Canary Islands have a discount of 50%, many on La Gomera consider these fares to be destroying visitor numbers and their small economy.\n\nA massive new trimaran has just been introduced on the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.fredolsen.es\/lineas\/ingles\/index.asp Fred Olsen route"]},". These ferries are very fast, completing the journey in 35 min. Crossings can be rough in high seas. Most expensive option, but runs up to four times a day.  Bus connection to Santa Cruz de Tenerife.\n\nThe new Fred Olsen ferry, Benchi Express,  is a catamaran  40 m in length and can carry more than 300 people with a speed of greater than 30 knots. The Benchi Express route is between Los Cristianos in Tenerife and San Sebastian de la Gomera, Playa Santiago to Valle Gran Rey.\n\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.naviera-armas.com\/ Naviera Armas"]}," Large, fast ferry taking around an hour to San Sebastian. Very nice ship with a big terrace on the upper deck and a lot of bars and salons inside.\n\nLa Gomera is in the Atlantic. This means that even in moderate windy weather the waves may become pretty big. In that case the catamarans may not sail. Particularly, the small Benchi Express is vulnerable. In the event the Benchi Express cannot sail, Fred Olsen will drive you to or from Gran Val Rey by bus. But, you need to be at the harbour 30 min earlier, and you sail on Olsen's big catamaran. \n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\t \n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nPublic transport has improved in recent years with regular bus services (4 or 5 per day, M-Sa; fewer on Su) to the main centres (Valle Gran Rey, Vallehermoso, Santiago) from the capital San Sebastian.  Note that departures don't usually coincide with the ferry arrival times. \nJourney time to Valle Gran Rey is around 1.75 hr. These buses are popular and it isn't always possible to get on especially at the port when boats come in. Buses returning to the tourist centres late in the afternoon tend to get full of walkers and likewise the ones heading into the mountains early in the mornings. Fares are very reasonable. Drivers do not like to pick up or set down between stops for tourists even though you may see them do it for elderly locals. The public buses are a blue\/turquoise colour and are run by Servicio Regular Gomera S.L.  Tickets are purchased from the driver. There are many other private coaches darting about the island which will not stop for you. The timetables do change and tourist offices will have up-to-date versions.  Plenty of websites reproduce these but they may not be up-to-date.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nReputable car hire companies include ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cicar.com CICAR"]}," or ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.gomerarentacar.com Gomera Rentacar"]},". If you book beforehand, the car hire companies can meet you with a car at the San Sebastian ferry terminal when you arrive. Petrol is very cheap, about half the price of mainland Europe. However, bear in mind that the roads are very winding indeed, so driving is slow. For example, as the crow flies, it is only about 22km across the island from San Sebastian to Valle Gran Rey, but the distance by road is over twice that, and it will take you an hour and a half to drive it. Many people combine walking with hitchhiking. Taxis are not prohibitively expensive especially if there are several of you sharing.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\t \n",{"type":"{{","value":[["cautionbox"],["Wildfires in the summer of 2012 have burned over 3000 hectares on the island, including over ten per cent of Garajonay National Park.

There are many paths all over the island, from gentle strolls through the rainforest to all day treks. Signage has improved dramatically over recent years, making self-guided walks much simpler.  \n\nSeveral firms offer guided walks, which can be useful if you don't have transport or want to do a point to point walk. One of these companies is ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.timah.net\/english\/ Timah"]},". They offer guided walks at around €30 each (including the transportation to the starting point of the walk as well as the trip back) with English and German speaking guides.\n\nAnother company offering walks is ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.temocoda.com\/uk\/index.html Viajes Temocoda"]},". Temocoda's walks are a little bit more expensive but lunch is included in the price.\n\nVisit the tourist office in Valle Gran Rey (Calle Lepanto, s\/n. La Playa) or the various travel agencies in Valle Gran Rey for information about other providers of walks. Agencies can usually make the booking for you, but at least Timah has an office in Valle Gran Rey (La Puntilla) and you can book your walk there as well. \n\nGuided walks can be recommended not only because they include transportation and free you from the infrequent bus service, but the guides will tell you all sorts of interesting tidbits about the island. \n\nA good map is vital, recommended ones are by ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.walking.demon.co.uk\/lagdcmap.htm DWG "]},", Kompass, and Freydag & Berndt. Each shows slightly different information, so consider buying two different ones.  Maps and guidebooks are readily available in San Sebastian and Valle Gran Rey.\n\nSeveral books offer detailed descriptions of available routes such as ",{"type":"''","value":["The Landscapes of Southern Tenerife and La Gomera"]}," by ",{"type":"''","value":["Sunflower Books"]}," and ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.walking.demon.co.uk\/walkla.htm ",{"type":"''","value":["Walk! La Gomera"]}," by DWG"]},". \n\nNormal precautions regarding walking on your own apply on La Gomera, too. Always make sure that somebody knows where you are headed and when you can be expected to return. Pack rain and windproof warm clothing in your daypack even it's nice and sunny when you leave. Also, don't forget to take a cellphone and a torch with you, drinking water and something to eat.  However, there are also many shorter walks (such as up one side of Valle Gran Rey and down the other) that need no more than sandals.\n\nWalking in heavy rain might be dangerous (as well as unpleasant) due to rock falls and landslides.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Mountain biking"]},"\nLa Gomera is a good biking destination as it offers mountainous paved roads as well as single trails and dirt roads for the mountain bikers. In Valle Gran Rey there are three mountain bike tour operators and bike rentals available in the villages of La Playa, La Puntilla and Vueltas.\nBe careful when riding down as the roads are steep and have tight bends. There are also two tunnels when coming down to Valle Gran Rey. The second and longer one can be circumvented by using the old road instead which goes by the mountainside. It starts on the right hand side of the tunnel entrance. However, ",{"type":"''","value":["extreme care is required"]}," as the railings on the old road are not in good condition (or missing altogether in places) and there are also big rocks and other debris on the road. When you drive in the tunnels make sure you have a headlight and a backlight (or at least a red reflector) so that cars can see you well ahead. Never ride without a well-fitting helmet.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Relaxing"]},"\nThe slow pace of life is contagious, the perfect antidote to stress.

Valle Gran Rey has safe sandy beaches at Vueltas and El Charco (literally 'The Puddle').  Swimming can be challenging and even dangerous on the open beaches around the island.  Playa la Caleta, near Hermigua, has a bar\/restaurant on the beach. There is a semi-nude beach (clothing is optional) called Playa del Ingles behind La Playa in Valle Gran Rey. However, it's rocky and very dangerous for swimming especially when the sea is rough. There is a warning sign on the beach saying that the latest (fatal?) accident happened in the end of 2005, so keep this in mind if you think about taking a dip there.\n\nSan Sebastian has two good beaches, Playa Santiago (as the name suggests) also has a beach. There is a public pool at Playa de Vallehermoso (near El Castillo) and there is a swimming tank-thing by the remains of the embarcadero in Hermigua.\n\nIf you don't mind the long, steep, winding drive, there is a lovely little beach at Alojera.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora"]},"\n\nFascinating sub-tropical vegetation abounds with the unique Laurisilva rainforest in the national park, Garajonay, which is situated on the highest part of La Gomera. Laurisilva has a very special property in that it makes clouds into rain: Due to the pressing upwards of the trade winds, there are often clouds on the top of La Gomera; but the leaves of the trees of Laurisilva have pores that catch the small drops from the clouds. The surplus water absorbed is secreted so that the trees are raining, which increases precipitation from 50-100%. Of the remaining Laurisilva is 50% growing on La Gomera, which makes Garajonay unique from a nature conservation point of view. Laurisilva has in earlier periods covered large areas surrounding the Middle Sea, but disappeared due to climate changes. The National Visitor Centre at Juego de Bolas, above Las Rosas, has a selection of native and endemic plants, as well as various artesanal artifacts. There are plenty fine walking paths in Garajonay and the surrounding landscape.\n\nThere is also a botanic garden of sorts near Vallehermoso.

These give a good balance between facilities and getting away from the stresses of western life. But the upper parts of this valley and all the beautiful rest of La Gomera remain unspoilt. There is also a push for more rural tourism, if you want to get completely away from things. However, it's worth remembering that the higher villages can be much cooler than the coast.\n\nThere are several hotels in San Sebastian, including the parador. Playa Santiago has the Jardin Tecina complex, run by Fred Olsen, expensive, but worth a visit to see the impressive flora and the \"James Bond\" lift down to the beach. While Valle Gran Rey has the Hotel Gran Rey on the seafront and the Hotel Playa Calera in La Playa. The three villages, of which Valle Gran Rey is comprised, offer many private rooms.
