Spectacular volcanic landscapes reaching up above the clouds with dense vegetation in the valleys make for some spectacular hiking. \n\nThe highest point on the island, El Roque de los Muchachos (2426m -- about 8000 feet), is easily accessible by car most of the year and the views from there are spectacular and provide a good introduction to the geography of the island (note that access is restricted at night as this is the site of a major international astronomical observatory -- always read the signposts -- also note that roads and trails can be closed for a few days in the winter due to snow). \nThere is a very extensive network of marked walking trails over the whole island which are well signposted and walking maps are available from the tourist office in Santa Cruz.\n\nAlong the northeast coast, you'll find masses of intricately terraced crops (especially bananas) interlaced with small towns and villages.\n\nIn the middle of the island there is Caldera de Taburiente, a huge erosion crater which is one of the biggest in the world. Guided hikes to the caldera are available. During winter months hiking on the river bed in the caldera can be really dangerous because rain can cause flash floods.\n\nThe capital of the island, Santa Cruz, has lots of well preserved old buildings and cobblestone streets. Along Avenida Maritima you can see old Canarian balconies made from the Canary pine.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Volcan de Teneguia.jpg"],["thumb"],["Volcan de Teneguia"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Santa Cruz de La Palma Mercato.jpg"],["thumb"],["Santa Cruz de La Palma Mercato"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]}," \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Inside the Caldera de Taburiente 4 (5489423342).jpg"],["thumb"],["Inside the Caldera de Taburiente"]]},"\nLos Tilos walk - if possible get four wheel taxi up to start of walk.

Tunnel number 12 is wet inside - one guide book described it as like a power-shower.  Then down through the laurisilva forest (a tiring but stunning descent of about 1000m).  Also don't miss the lookout - a volcanic dyke about two feet wide with sheer drops on both sides, but protected by handrails with totally stunning 360 degree views - makes Symond's Yat look a bit pathetic.

It takes a minimum of seven days which would require walking around eight hours of tough walking daily.  If possible take at least a couple of days extra.  Can be done on a budget by using pensions where possible.  The constantly changing scenery is stunning, you will meet some interesting locals on the way and it is an experience to remember.\n\nThe island also organsises the Transvolcania which is a run up the Volcano route - and beyond.
