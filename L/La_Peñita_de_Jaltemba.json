The main street, or \"La Avenida\" as it is known runs east - west from the highway to the beach and has a central boulevard lined with palm trees and benches. A number of tourist shops, clothing stores, shoe stores, restaurants and other merchants run up and down the street. Two blocks south of the beach end of La Avenida there is a large shady plaza. Each Thursday a 4 block long street market (Tiangui) takes place in La Peñita. This market is a must see with everything from fresh fruit, seafood, vegetables to housewares, hardware, clothing and arts and crafts. The colors and smells provide a carnival atmoshphere! \n\nIt is considered by some to be the service community for the busy resort of Rincón de Guayabitos immediately to the south. The two communities are separated only by a narrow river. Rincón de Guayabitos is a community of hotels, bunaglows, small tourist shops and restaurants, while La Peñita provides banking services, grocery stores, vegetable markets as well as public facilities such as the library and post offices. In La Penita at the east end of La Avenida, where it meets Highway 200, the Rincón-La Penita-Rincón shuttle system is available to transport you between the communities for a few pesos.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["21.038518"],["-105.246965"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Nayarit"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:La Peñita de Jaltemba"]]}]
