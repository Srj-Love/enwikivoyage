The average humidity is of 77.6% and the predominant southeast winds blow during four months in the year.\n\nLa Plata was designed around a central axis marked by 51st and 53rd Avenues, the main artery of the city where the main buildings and landmarks are located: the Cathedral, City Hall, Moreno Plaza, the Teatro Argentino, the Provincial Legislature and Government around Plaza San Martin. Its urban design was worked on by Pedro Benoit and his prestigious team, who are among the most distinguished in the world. His basic design was a perfect square, cut in half diagonally and with plazas and parks scattered around the city, grand tree-lined boulevards and a forest right near the center of the city.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\nBuses from Retiro in Buenos Aires leave all the time - cost A$11 and take 1 hour or so.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nLa Plata is an easy city to navigate because of its grid system. You can easily walk from one side of the city to another within 45 minutes. Taxis are plentiful and cheap. They can be hailed on the street, but be observant; the diagonal avenues that cut through La Plata can be confusing and taxi drivers will often take advantage of that to rack up the price on the meter.\n\nThe city buses, or the ",{"type":"''","value":["micro"]},", are very cheap and reliable. Within one city zone (the square-grid downtown counts as one zone) the bus costs 1,10 Argentine pesos ($.25 USD). It will cost 1,90 pesos to travel into the suburbs. You must specify the amount you are paying upon entering the bus. If you are confused as to how much you should pay, ask the bus driver. Buses only take coins, which are very hard to come by in Argentina. You can also buy a prepaid bus card at any news stand for 19 pesos. You must also hale the bus as it passes the bus stop or it will continue its route.
