A very popular way of getting around the town is through riding motor bikes as well as gua guas. Gua Guas is another name for buses. The motor bikes are easily accessible due to the fact that the people who ride them are always out like taxis.  The catch here is that the bikers will demand a high price at first for the distances you are going.  Different people ask different prices.  You have to be smart and not always accept the first price these people give you.  Bargain with them and try to make the prices go lower.  Chances are that they wouldn't want you to go to someone else.  Be patient and you will pay the price that is appropriate for the distance you are going.  Another thing, when you come upon a bike, make sure to eye the rider.  Sometimes these people aren't experienced enough to drive around especially when they drive up to four people at a time. There is no such thing as accident insurance when riding these bikes.  If you are involved in an accident, it's on you to pay for hospital bills or whatever bills you would have to pay for. It's pretty much riding at your own risk.  Remember these riders are locals trying to make extra cash by giving people rides.  The railroad system is pretty much out the question.  They are mostly used to carry goods across the Dominican Republic. The buses are the cheapest way to go! Moto conchos aka bikes prices depend on the person and are less safe. Depending on your taste and needs, make sure you are ready to take one of these rides.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nA must see is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Altos de Chavon"]},".
