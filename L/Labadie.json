It is a private resort leased by Royal Caribbean International (RCI) for use by its Royal Caribbean Cruise Line and Celebrity Cruise line ",{"type":"[[","value":[["cruise ships"]]},". Royal Caribbean International has contributed the largest proportion of tourist revenue to Haiti since 1986. The resort is completely tourist-oriented and safe as there is a personal security force. A controlled group of Haitian merchants are given sole rights to sell their merchandise and establish their businesses in the resort. The site is fenced off from the surrounding area. The cruise ships anchor either at the pier or offshore and passengers walk from the pier to dry land or are ferried to the resort when ships have to anchor offshore.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:LabadeeDragonsBreath.jpg"],["right"],["thumb"],["360px"],["Dragon Tail Beach, Labadee.

The cruise ships moor to the pier at Labadee capable of servicing the Oasis class ships, which was completed in late 2009.\n\nOther visitors can come by land to the resort's security gate or may use small water taxis from a nearby town. Guards are reportedly very \"firm\" with anyone (especially Haitians that do not work there) who attempts to breach the security perimeter.\n\nExcept for some workers and security people, virtually no one stays beyond twilight.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nThe resort is on a peninsula about 300-400 m long, so is small enough to reach all areas by foot from the landing dock. Open air shuttles also run between all areas.\n\nThe resort does offer wave-runners and kayaks to explore elsewhere along the sheltered shoreline.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:LabadeePark.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["300px"],["Labadee's water park and rentals area"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["The beaches are quite pretty, though the ones closest to the dock can become crowded if the cruise ship is carrying many families.

Swimming on the Atlantic side can be tricky (due to undertows and sharp rocks\/coral) if there is a brisk wind (often).

Passengers receive a buffet lunch and tea, lemonade, punch for free but must pay for soda and alcoholic beverages just as on the ship.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nThere are seven bars scattered across the peninsula, including a nice bar overlooking the beach near the main café building. Waiters constantly offer frozen drinks, usually the labadoozie (or sometimes spelled labaduzie) along the beaches and will also retrieve well drinks or beer on request--all at cruise ship prices and paid by cruise ship room key\/account card. The labadoozie consists of a number of mixed fruit juices. It may either be non-alcoholic or have rum in it, depending on what the customer wants. Also, bottled water is available at the bars.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nThere are no such facilities in the resort, and security guards will remove any visitor trying to remain overnight.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["19.786389"],["-72.245556"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Haiti"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Labadee"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Labadee"]]}]
