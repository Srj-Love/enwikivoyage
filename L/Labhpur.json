He passed matriculation from Labhpur in 1916. Many of his novels and stories carry vivid descriptions of the area.\nIn the novel Hansulibanker Upkatha, he writes, “The Hansulibank countryside is somewhat rough land. Here, man’s fight is more with land, than that with rivers. When drought comes, in extreme summer, the river becomes a desert, it is a land of sand – only deep water somehow manages to weave a narrow way through it. The land then is transformed into rock. The grass dries up. The land heats up as if it is a piece of heated-up iron.”\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nLabhpur is about 30 km from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Santiniketan"]]}," by road.
