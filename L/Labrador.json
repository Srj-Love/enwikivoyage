Home to a diverse population of Euro-Canadians and Natives (Inuit, Innu, Metis), Labrador is a site of first contact between peoples--it is often considered to be Markland, one of the locations visited by Leif Ericson in the 11th Century.  Despite its rich history and resources, the region and the people of Labrador have not been historically wealthy.  The region is isolated, with resource development and roads such as the Trans-Labrador Highway being recent projects.  In many ways, the relationship between Labrador and its historical 'parent,' ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Newfoundland"]]},", has been a microcosm of the relationship between the province of Newfoundland & Labrador and the government of Canada--Labrador often feels ignored and exploited by the island government in Newfoundland.  Nonetheless, like Newfoundland, Labrador is culturally rich and is an interesting destination for tourists that is off-the-beaten path.  \n\nA note of caution: While often interesting to visit, many Labrador Native communities do not encourage tourist 'invasions'.

You can get to Labrador from any Atlantic province or Quebec. Major airports with direct flights to Labrador include Montreal (YUL), Halifax (YHZ) and St. John's (YYT).

It should be reiterated that these flights are ",{"type":"''","value":["expensive"]},". One way flights not booked well in advance are upwards of 700 dollars. One way. Book well in advance.

Please read the Stay Safe section if you intend on making it to your destination. The portion from Baie-Comeau to the provincial border is mostly unpaved. Past Labrador City, almost all of the road to Goose Bay has recently been paved. The highway continues just outside of Goose Bay as a gravel road to the coast. The new gravel portion between Goose Bay and Cartwright Junction is 300 kilometres, and another 100 to gas stations in either Cartwright or Port Hope Simpson. The road is paved again past Red Bay until its terminus at Blanc Sablon, where you can catch ferries to Newfoundland. It is not possible to drive from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sept-ÃŽles"]]}," to Blanc Sablon by following the north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence as the road simply does not exist.

Now they just flag stop at a place they call Emeril Junction, which is literally in the middle of nowhere next to the Trans Labrador Highway. There is no cell phone service and no services whatsoever. Unless you have someone waiting for you, it is completely useless. And it's a shame, because from what I can tell the Sept-Iles-Schefferville line is a fantastic ride with spectacular scenery.
