It's quite a close community where everyone knows everyone. The main town is known as Labuan Town (Bandar Labuan in Malay) but was formerly known as Victoria during the colonial era. Labuan Town is among the cleanest towns in Malaysia. You will observe the Labuan Corporation (local authority) workers diligently doing their job. Labuan was proclaimed a Federal Territory on 16\/04\/1984 and declared an International Offshore Financial Centre on 1\/10\/1990.\nA few of the major businesses that are run on the island include international offshore banking, steel mills, a methanol plant, floor tiles production, flour mills as well as offshore supplies.

Due to the fact that land utility is geared more towards property and industrial use, there is less agricultural activity in the area.

A sizeable area on the south western side of the island is utilised by shipbuilding, manufacturing and oil and gas industries.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nLabuan has a tropical climate with two annual monsoon seasons - the South West monsoon from April to June and the North East monsoon from September to December.

Labuan had a glorious history under the rule of various empires. After the demise of the Majapahit Empire in the 14th century, Labuan came under the rule of the Brunei Sultanate. On 24 December 1846, Captain G.R. Mundy, commanding H.M.S. Iris, took possession of Labuan, \"In the Name of Her Majesty Victoria Queen of Great Britain and Ireland under the Direction of His Excellency Rear Admiral Sir Thomas Cochrane, C.B., Commander-in-Chief\".\n\nThe British had negotiated with the Sultanate of Brunei for Labuan among other things. by 1847 the British government concluded a Treaty of Friendship and Commerce with the Sultan of Brunei, at the same time acquiring the island of Labuan. On 1 August 1848, Labuan was declared a free port and open to settlers. The Colonial Office took over Labuan in January 1906. In 1907 it became part of the Straits Settlements, a British colony comprising Singapore, Penang and Malacca.\n\nDuring World War II, Labuan was occupied by the Japanese, along with other parts of what was then called British North Borneo (now Sabah). Thousands of Allied troops died in the fighting and eventual defeat of the Japanese in Labuan.\n\nIn 1963, Sabah joined the Federation of Malaysia, with Labuan included as a district of Sabah. In the 1984 Labuan Agreement, Sabah agreed to cede Labuan to the Federal Government of Malaysia. Labuan became a Federal Territory, with a status equivalent to that of the states of Malaysia.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Talk "]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["Speaking Malay in Labuan"],["Please notice some basic communication terms in Labuan Malay Dialect.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Awu"]}," - ",{"type":"''","value":["Yes"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Inda"]}," - ",{"type":"''","value":["No"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ani"]}," - ",{"type":"''","value":["This"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Atu"]}," - ",{"type":"''","value":["That"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Usin"]}," - ",{"type":"''","value":["Money"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Basar"]}," - ",{"type":"''","value":["Big"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Damit"]}," - ",{"type":"''","value":["Small"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Padas"]}," - ",{"type":"''","value":["Spicy"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Aing Hangat"]}," - ",{"type":"''","value":["Hot Water"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Aing Sajuk"]}," - ",{"type":"''","value":["Cold Water"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Aku Kan Bali Gulaian"]}," - ",{"type":"''","value":["I Would Like To Buy Vegetables"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Kan Ke Mana Kita?"]}," - ",{"type":"''","value":["Where Are You Going?"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Nyaman Jua Makanan Ani"]}," - ",{"type":"''","value":["This Food Is Quite Tasty"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mulih Ke Hotel Tah Ku Dulu"]}," - ",{"type":"''","value":["I'd Like To Go Back To Hotel"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bulih Kita Ngantar Kami Ke Airport?"]},"-",{"type":"''","value":["Can You Drive Us To Airport?"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bulih Ku Batanya?"]},"-",{"type":"''","value":["Can I Ask You ?"]}]}]]},"\n\nEnglish & Malay are widely spoken.

The driving attitude of people here are quite leisure, so it's common to have a car cruising in front of you very very slow without any purpose. There are lots of jaywalkers, and pedestrians crossing the road don't practice much caution.
