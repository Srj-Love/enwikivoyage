The operators on these routes will occasionally suspend services due to breakdown or heavy seas.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"''","value":["Please see the main Lombok ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lombok#Get-in"],["article"]]}," for details on air and sea connections through to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bali"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Java"]]}," and other destinations westward"]},"."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Central and East Lombok"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Labuhan Lombok"]]}]
