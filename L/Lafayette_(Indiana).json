To the east of the river is Lafayette and to the west is West Lafayette. Lafayette is broken down into several neighborhoods. Starting at the river and heading east is downtown. Here you will find numerous shops and restaurants as well as most of the museums and theaters. North of downtown is the Historical Centennial Neighborhood. South of downtown is the Ninth Street Hill Neighborhood. Most of the shopping and hotels are either downtown or along one of the main arteries. State Rd 26 runs east and west bisecting both cities. State Rd 52 curves around the East side of town and crosses the river into the Northern side of West Lafayette. On State Rd 52 near the Southeast side of town you will find the Tippecanoe Mall. Interstate 65 marks the eastern edge of Lafayette. From South to North there are 4 exits for Lafayette, St Rd 38, St Rd 26, St Rd 25, and St Rd 43 (for West Lafayette).\n\nThe John T. Myers Pedestrian Bridge connects downtown Lafayette with West Lafayette. Starting at the river and heading west into West Lafayette is the Levee area and Wabash Landing. This area is fairly new with several shops, a multiplex theater, a park, and an outdoor ice skating rink. Continue west up the hill on State Rd. 26 to the Chauncey Hill and Village area. There you will find most of the college bars and several restaurants. Continue west on Hwy. 26 to pass through the main campus of Purdue University. To the north and east of Purdue is the main residential area of West Lafayette.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Bus ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.gocitybus.com\/"]},", There are 15 bus routes around the cities. Tickets are $1, 10 tokens for $7.50 (you can ask for one free transfer ticket), $28 for a calendar month pass, free for students and staff at Purdue. There is a free trolley bus going from downtown Lafayette to West Lafayette\/Purdue and back every 15 minutes.  Some bus lines do not run on weekends, in the summer, or anytime when classes are not in session; check schedules for details.
