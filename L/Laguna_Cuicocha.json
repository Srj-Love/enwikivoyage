Best done in a clockwise directions even though the signs all point the other way.  Starts with an hour up a dirt road, 4km to \"Las Pinas\" then the real fun begins - basically traverses the rim of the crater and is an outstanding hike.  There are two shelters at about the 2,5-3 hour mark going clockwise (earlier counterclockwise) that are useful if it starts raining.
