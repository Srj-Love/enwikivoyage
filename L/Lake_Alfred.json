The town lies along U.S. 17\/92, which runs north\/south through the center of town. Easily a drive-though community for motorists, it is worth a stop to hike through Mackay Gardens, browse the family-owned businesses along Haines St, or maybe even learn to water ski.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nLake Alfred was established in 1883 soon after the South Florida Railroad reached the area by settlers escaping the cold of Fargo, North Dakota. The town was initially called \"Fargo\", but the Post Office objected over confusion with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Largo (Florida)"],["Largo"]]},". The town then took on the name Chubb and later Bartow Junction because it lay at the junction of a road leading south into the county seat Bartow. In 1913, it was named Lake Alfred after the nearby lake which, in turn, had been named for Alfred Parslow, an early settler. The Mackay estate on the north shore of Lake Rochelle was built around 1920. It was purchased in 2004 by the city and is slowly being renovated to its original glory and will hopefully be placed on the National Register of Historic Places soon.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Forecast"],["Lake Alfred"],["28.093664"],["-81.724998"]]},"\nLake Alfred's climate is much the same as the rest of Central Florida (except coasts). Winters are mild, with highs in the 70s (21-27°C) and lows in the 50s (10-15°C). Lows in the 30s (0-5°C) are common after cold fronts and there are usually a handful of lows below freezing each winter, although that requires clear skies, so it usually warms very rapidly after sunrise (30°F at 6AM, 55°F by noon is typical). Cold fronts occasionally pass by as squall lines, so tornadoes in December or January are not unusual. Snow is rare; the last measurable snowfall was in 1977, although sleet\/wintry mix fell in an unusually cold January 2010. Summers are hot and humid, with highs around 90-95°F (33-35°C) and lows around 74-78°F (23-26°C). During the summer, onshore winds from both coasts travel inland, heat up, rise and build into thunderstorms, usually along a rough line. Lying in the center of the state, the line of storms (each called a \"seabreeze\") often collide and become severe, with tornadoes (small EF0-1s...not like the powerful tornadoes in the Plains states), 50+ mph winds, and hail possible. Strong storms are usually preceded by cooler winds caused by the rain-cooled air (cold air sinks) rapidly flowing away from the storm. The temperature after a strong thunderstorm passes can drop from 95°F (35°C) to 75°F (24°C) and since the storms can be fairly small, you can drive 5 miles and the temperature will drop\/rise 20°F (10°C) between rain-cooled and surrounding areas.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nLake Alfred is located along ",{"type":"'''","value":["U.S. 17\/92"]},", just north of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Winter Haven"]]}," and east of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Auburndale"]]}," and a few miles west of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Haines City"]]},".
