Since then several cultures have been changing on its shores when in the XVIII century Buryat nationality came into being. The Russian sources first mention Baikal in 1640.

Specific traits are added to the climate of the Baikal by winds: barguzin, sarma, verkhovik, kultuk.\nIt is a common thinking that the Baikal is best for visit in July, when temperatures and winds reach favorable condition.

It takes around 4 to 6 hours, since the train is really slow. But you have time to look around, because the railway is going by the shore of the lake. It costs 46 rubles. It is so slow because it is the old Baykal railroad was built around 100 years ago.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Olkhon"]]},".
