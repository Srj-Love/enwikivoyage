Summer water temperatures range from about 16C to the mid 30s; because the lake is shallow, yesterday's air temperature will be a good guide to the warmth of today's water.  There are many places to go down waterslides and just take in a bit of shallow bathing, but be aware that the shallow banks of Balaton are very murky. You can scarcely avoid getting silt everywhere. Beaches on the north shore tend to have more facilities, but have an entrance fee.The shore here tends to be rocky and the water deepens rapidly to a mximum of about 14 metres. Most beaches on the southern shore are free, though large sections of the shore are privately owned by hotels and campsites. The lake shelves slowly, so you can walk out for 500m or more before you are out of your depth, so it's very safe for children. Large free beaches are at Zamárdi, Balatonboglár, Fonyód and Balatonfenyves. There are many hundreds of access points to the shore, so you are unlikely to have to walk far to find a pleasant place to swim."]},"\nSince the lake is shallow, summer storms can create very large waves, and people have drowned in most years. A system of warning beacons around the lake alerts bathers to expected strong winds and storms: 30 flashes\/minute, colour white\/yellow means winds 40-60 km\/h, and you should move close to the shore. 60 flashes red\/white means winds over 60 km\/h.

Another common \"beach food\" is cooked corn on the cob (",{"type":"''","value":["főtt kukorica"]},"), grilled sausages (",{"type":"''","value":["sült kolbász"]},") and of course, ice cream (",{"type":"''","value":["fagylalt"]},", or more colloquially, ",{"type":"''","value":["fagyi"]},").\n\nYou can also try a special Lake Balaton fish called ",{"type":"''","value":["fogas"]}," (pike-perch or Zander), served roasted.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nThe hills north from Balaton are know for their wine. The best you can do is going for a wine spotting tour.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nLake Balaton has been the holiday playground of ordinary Hungarians for over a century, and most of the accommodation is in private houses and apartments rented by the owners, often through agencies. All along the road there are signs for \"Tourist information\" which are really agents for accommodation and tours, rather than the official tourist offices (called Tourinform). Many visitors arrive without booking and can usually find rooms for around Euro 15 per person\/night. Costs for a house with 3 bedrooms can run from about Euro300\/week to over 1,000 (luxury house right on lake shore). \n\nIt's worth to book the accommodation before arriving because in July and August most of the places are totally full and it is hard to find a free room.\n\nHigh season for Hungarians is the school holidays, from mid-June to the end of August, but many people go home by St Stephen's Day (20 August). The whole place becomes very much quieter by mid-August, and you can easily find accommodation. On the downside, lakeside bars and restaurants also close for the season.\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["46.85"],["17.78"],["zoom=10"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Hungary"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Lake Balaton"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Balaton"]]}]
