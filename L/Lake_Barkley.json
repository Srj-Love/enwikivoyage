The lake is more shallow than Kentucky Lake, but just as exciting. Anglers will find the fishing exceptional on Lake Barkley. While the lake is probably best known for its spring crappie run, catfish and game fish such as large and smallmouth bass can be caught yearround.  Spring, summer and fall months are filled with swimming, camping, boating, sunning, skiing, horseback riding, fishing, and golfing.  Accommodations vary from scenic lakeside lodging to motels, hotels, and bed and breakfast establishments. These scenic lakeside resorts offer town houses, efficiencies, cottages, condos, and cabins. For the family who camps, both privately and publicly owned campgrounds are available.  Campers can choose from primitive sites to developed campgrounds. Paved boat ramps are available along the shoreline, with area marinas offering a variety of services.  If you don’t own a boat, you can easily rent a fishing boat, pontoon, houseboat, or ski boat for the day or week.  Lake Barkley and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kentucky Lake"]]},", with a freeflowing canal, provide more than 600 miles of round-trip cruising. Local marinas offer shopping that includes clothing, specialty items (fishing & water sports) and gift items along with restaurants overlooking beautiful Lake Barkley where you can enjoy a delicious meal in a relaxing atmosphere.
