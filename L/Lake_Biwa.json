The water is very clean and the beach is very relaxing. Many people flock there on weekends and you can also camp there.  It is better than going to most seaside beaches in Kansai as it is so clean.

Bicycling around the Lake Biwa area is great fun, with wide paved paths in many places, and approximately a 220km bike ride to go around the lake.  Bicycle friendliness is evident everywhere and you should be able to find places to stay at various points around the lake if you bike tour.  Witness four man or woman rowing teams in action on the Satagawa River during your tour.  Ride a functioning sternwheeler, the \"Michigan\".  Many parks, public restrooms and places to get water or drinks are near the southwestern part of the bike path.  A volleyball court is on the beach northwest of the southernmost bridge and many joggers also share the bike paths.  Fishing from a boat or the shore, kayaking and sailing are popular here.  A successful cicada hunt by a young boy with a butterfly net was witnessed, but giving off a loud buzzing sound, the cicada got away when the boy lifted his net.  Kite flying during windy conditions could also be fun here, with no nearby wires to foul the kite line.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nBring a portable BBQ set out to Omi Maiko or Shiga Beach. \n\nAlternatively, at Omi Maiko, in summer are food vendors.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nLoad up a cooler full of whatever you like.
