What more could you want? The fare depends on the size of your vehicle.  A compact car like a Ford Focus or an Opel Astra costs €9.  Crossings are frequent and you shouldn't have to wait long as there is often a ferry loading when you drive onto the slip. Even at night times, ferries cross the lake hourly. If you travel by foot, be aware that buses might not be available all night, while ferries still are.
