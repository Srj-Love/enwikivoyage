The Lakeland Fells are ",{"type":"[[","value":[["England"]]},"'s only true mountain range and though not high by world standards (i.e. none being much over 3000 feet or 1000 metres) they nevertheless offer a huge number of challenging and rewarding hillwalks. All can be walked (as opposed to \"climbed\" with ropes etc.) and due to the long tradition of recreational walking here there is an exceptional network of paths and routes. Additionally there is free access to virtually all areas above the \"intake wall\" (i.e. the last wall as you climb out of the valley).\n\nAccording to the most respected authority (guidebook author A. Wainwright) there are 214 Fells, most of which offer a number of routes, plus many opportunities to ridge-walk between the fells.\n\nThe highest is Scafell Pike (pronounced \"Score-fell\"). This \"highest\" designation leads to a lot of traffic, and visitors who want to experience a high Lakeland Fell may want to choose another. Some of the slightly smaller fells are in fact much more rewarding to climb as well as offering better views. Great Gable and Helvellyn are popular choices. Less well-known hills include Grisedale Pike, Fairfield, and Bowfell.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThe main attraction is the lakes and fells carved by glacial erosion and providing dramatic and inspiring scenery although much modified by man's intervention mainly by farming. It is the former home of cultural luminaries such as William Wordsworth and John Ruskin, and the walks and fells are famously documented by Alfred Wainwright.\n\nFirst settled in the Stone Age (some residents still exist) and occupied by the Romans the area was heavily influenced by the Norse in their occupation circa 900A.D. They cleared the woods to produce charcoal to smelt lead in Glenridding and copper in the Borrowdale Valley and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Coniston"]]},". They introduced the Herdwick sheep to the fells and left a legacy of language such as 'gill' gorge, 'beck' stream, 'tarn' lake, 'dale' valley and 'force' waterfall; of them all 'thwaite', a clearing in a wood, is the most common.\n\nThe Agricultural Revolution and the Enclosure Acts in the 18th century saw the erection of the dry stone walls which are a predominant feature on the fellsides. The 19th Century saw the advent of tourism with the arrival of the railway in the town of Windermere where it terminates.\n\nThe destination is popular with national and international visitors and this can easily cause congestion in busy periods at the most popular locations. Visitor attractions are numerous and not limited to scenic attractions.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By rail"]},"\nThe high speed West Coast Main Line skirts the eastern edge of the Lake district with stations at Oxenholme and Penrith. Fastest journey times from London are three hours to Penrith and 2.40 to Oxenholme.\n\nWindermere station is most conveniently located for the Southern Lakes. The train from here travels to Oxenholme station on the main West Coast line. The Leeds-Settle-Carlisle line also links the lakes to Yorkshire, as does the line from Leeds to Barrow via Hellifield.\n\nFor the northern lakes, it is best to travel to Penrith, from where it is possible to catch a bus to Keswick and Ullswater.\n\nThe South and West Lakes is accessed by one of the most scenic railways in the country. Starting from Carnforth the line travels across the Lake District peninsulas by a series of impressive viaducts to Barrow in Furness. The Cumbria Coast line then travels via Millom to Whitehaven, and re-joins the West Coast Main line at Carlisle. At Foxfield the old market town of Broughton in Furness and the Duddon valley is accessible. From Millom northwards some of the most interesting of the western valleys can be seen and accessed from such as Drigg, Seascale and Ravenglass stations. Onward travel in such as the \"Wasdale bus\", or by taxi may be necessary for those without bicycles. Further north the line literally runs along the beach at Braystones and after a superb serpentine section next to the Irish Sea it passes through St Bees with its Heritage Coast and ancient priory, and thence to Whitehaven.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nM6 motorway and enter the park via either the A590 from Junction 36 for the South Lakes, or the A66 at Penrith from Junction 40 for the North Lakes.

Regular trains run direct from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Manchester Airport"]]}," station to Windermere, Penrith and Barrow-in-Furness. Newcastle airport is on the Metro and after travelling to Newcastle City, the Tyne valley line can be used to get to Carlisle.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe area is served by multiple bus routes, many of them operated by Stagecoach. However, as this is a rural area, and routes are necessarily limited to the roads in the valleys, it is sensible to plan your travel in advance.\n\nThis also applies to getting around by car, with journey times being extended due to the slow winding roads. Bringing your own car to the lakes is the most popular option, but motorists may encounter hefty parking fees\/restrictions in large towns, or even at the base of popular hill walking routes.\n\nThe beautiful coastal railway, travelling between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Carlisle"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Barrow-in-Furness"]]}," allows access to many of the rarely visited seaside towns and villages. The \"Lakes Rover\" ticket offers good value for rail travel around this area.\n\nBudget travellers can book a day tour to get to see the best of the Lake District in a day.

It's definitely recommended to be prepared for rain, wear high-visibility clothing and fit lights, as the weather in this part of the country changes very quickly and rain can cause road-conditions to be slippery and visibility is greatly reduced. Also be particularly cautious of traffic - although the roads are not busy, local drivers who are familiar with the roads tend to drive very fast so take particular care when approaching blind corners. Although bike-rental is available in some larger towns in the region, the bikes available are generally sub-standard mountain-bikes - a high-quality road, hybrid or touring bike is more highly recommended. Fortunately bikes can be carried on all trains operating in the region (although a free reservation must be acquired before boarding).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nThe National Park features an extensive network of footpaths throughout the valleys and on the fells (the local term for mountains), allowing excellent access.\nSurprise View in Borrowdale, with views over Derwentwater, Keswick and Skiddaw.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["See also"],["Hikes in the Lake District"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Old Man of Coniston (Lake District, UK).JPG"],["thumb"],["Old Man of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Coniston"]]},"."]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Go walking"]},".
