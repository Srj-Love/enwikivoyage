If you have visions of driving to the water's edge, parking and looking out over the lake, then think again.  Lake Eyre is shallow, even when in flood.  Much of the lake is only 20-30cm in depth.  As you approach the lake, the land becomes boggy a fair distance from what you may consider to be the edge of the water.  Higher points of land to view over the lake a few and far between, although you may find an earth mound here and there.\n\nThe roads leading to the lake are remote country.
