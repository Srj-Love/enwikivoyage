It surrounds Lake Nakuru, located in the Central Rift Conservation Area in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southern Rift Valley"]]}," region of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kenya"]]},". Originally protected as a bird sanctuary, this park hosts over 400 bird species, including 5 globally threatened species, and is an important stop on the African-Eurasian Migratory Flyway. This park was also the first national Rhino sanctuary and hosts one of the world’s highest concentrations of the Black Rhinoceros.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:nakuruflamingos.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["Flamingos on Lake Nakuru"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nLake Nakuru National Park is one of Kenya’s 23 National Parks and one of two in the Premium category, along with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amboseli National Park"]]},". It can be found in Central Kenya, about 90 miles (140km) northwest of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nairobi"]]},", in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nakuru"]]}," district of the Rift Valley Province. The ecosystem is comprised of the lake, surrounded by wooded and bushy grasslands. The park supports a wide ecological diversity including Flamingos (Greater and Lesser) and other water birds, and the Black and White Rhinoceros which are the major attractions of the area. \n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nLake Nakuru National Park started as a bird viewing and sport shooting area of migratory birds in 1950s, but has since been expanded and fenced to protect populations of endangered giraffes and rhinoceros.\n",{"type":"*","value":["1957 - declared a conservation area "]},{"type":"*","value":["1961 - Southern two thirds designated a bird sanctuary"]},{"type":"*","value":["1964 - the bird sanctuary was extended covering the whole lake and a small strip of land around it"]},{"type":"*","value":["1968 - gazetted as National Park "]},{"type":"*","value":["1977- a number of Rothschild Giraffes translocated to the park from western Kenya for their protection"]},{"type":"*","value":["1984 - established as first government managed rhino sanctuary"]},{"type":"*","value":["1986 - an electric fence was erected around the park to replace the earlier chainlink"]},{"type":"*","value":["1987 - the park was declared a rhino sanctuary.

The lake is highly saline, so it is surrounded by a grassland of highly adaptable alkaline grasses. This park also has many hills with established viewpoints from which the lake, the woodlands, and often times the herds of buffalo can be seen. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and Fauna"]},"\nIn addition to its 400 species of birds, Lake Nakuru National Park is home to 50+ mammal species, and over 500 species of flora. This park is famous for the flocks of Greater and Lesser Flamingos that gather around the lake, sometimes with as many as 2 million! You can find this great pink mass around the lake for a good part of the year, as these iconic birds stay mostly within the Rift Valley, migrating from lake to lake. Because Lake Nakuru National Park was fenced to protect endangered Rhinos and Giraffes, it can’t support African Elephants, so you won’t find any here!\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:nakururhinos.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["A family of White Rhinoceros near the lake"]]},"\n\nYou are guaranteed to see:\nWhite Rhinos, African Buffalos, Rothschild Giraffes, Zebras, Impalas, Olive Baboons, Vervet Monkeys, Waterbucks, a variety of water birds (Yellow-billed Pelicans, Marabou Storks, Hammerkops, Fish Eagles, etc.)\n\nCommon in the park:\nHyenas, Jackals, Lesser Flamingos, Hippopotamus, Pythons\n\nIf you are lucky you may see:\nLions, Leopards, Black Rhinos, Wild Dogs, Colobus Monkeys, Cheetahs\n\nDon’t forget the plants! In Lake Nakuru National Park you can see a wide variety of beautiful landscapes: from grasslands to dense forests, and the very rare tarconanthus bushlands and euphorbia forests.\n\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nLake Nakuru National Park is officially classified as dry sub-humid to semi-arid, which basically means it’s not too wet and not too dry, or too hot or cold. The climate in this area is really beautiful, you won’t fry in the sun here like you would in Amboseli or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tsavo"]]},". You are likely however, to get rained on. Late afternoon is the most common time for rain showers. If you want the best chance of avoiding these rains, consider coming some time between July to December or January to March. However, avoiding the rain is not guaranteed, even during these dryer months. Also, these months are in the peak tourism season, so the park will be very crowded with tourist vehicles. If you don’t mind a little rain and you want to avoid the crowd, come in December or April to June (you’d also save money coming at this time!). Another great thing about this park- it’s fenced, so even during the wet months you will see wildlife because they cannot migrate away from the park. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe park opens at 7am. If you are traveling from Nairobi, then take the Naironi-Nakuru highway. On the way to Nakuru you will have a great view of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rift Valley"]]},", so drive slow and enjoy the scenery! From Nairobi, it is about a 30-minute drive to a scenic overlook at 7200 feet (2200 meters) above sea level and from here you can get a spectacular view of the volcanoes Suswa and Longonot. There are also a group of great little curio shops at this stop where you can buy souvenirs. Seeing the entire park could take you a full day, so plan to arrive around 9am unless you have more than a day in the area. It might take you few minutes to get your ticket and the vehicle checked. \n\nThe park has very well established roads that make most parts of the park accessible by 2-wheel-drive vehicles. Some less-traveled parts and most viewpoint hills will require 4-wheel-drive. The park has three gates: the Main Gate and Lanet Gate that link the park with the Nairobi-Nakuru highway and the less-used Nderit Gate.\n\nIf you choose to fly: It’s about a 25-minute flight from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi to the Naishi airstrip inside the park.\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\nThe entry fee is $80 for adult, nonresident foreigners, $40 for nonresident children and students. If possible, pay in US$. If the fee is paid in Kenyan Shillings (KSH), the fee is converted to US$ at a highly unfavorable rate.\nFor Kenyan nationals the fee is KSH 1,000 for adults, KSH 200 for children; for foreign adult residents of Kenya the fee is KSH 1,000 and one-half that amount for resident children ages 3 through 17. \nIf you’re using a currency other than the US$, see here for an up-to-date exchange rate calculator: http:\/\/www.kws.org\/tourism\/exchange.html \n\nA really cool new thing that KWS has started is called SafariCard. You can buy a permanent one ahead of time and load it up with money to use at several of Kenya’s parks, or you can buy a temporary one at the gate, surrendered at the gate when you leave. See the details here: http:\/\/www.kws.org\/about\/safaricard.html \n\nAn additional vehicle fee is required, the amount of which is determined by the number of seats in your vehicle.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe best way to get around almost any national park is by car.

If you’re staying in Nairobi you can probably find a lot of this stuff at a Tusky’s (large supermarket chain in Kenya), but it may still be a good idea to bring it from home.\n\nSouvenirs can be bought inside the park in the lodge gift shops, but if you want to buy from one of these places make sure you budget for it. Stuff in these gift shops is not cheap. If you have time, it’s better to spend it exploring and shopping in the nearby ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nakuru"]]}," town. You can find the same stuff from locals here for 1\/3 the price lodge gift shops ask for. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat & Drink"]},"\nIf you are staying outside the park or will only be in the area for a day, you should definitely bring your own food and drinks and enjoy them at one of the scenic picnic spots throughout the park. However, if your budget allows it, you can stop at one of the lodges in the park and try the buffet or the a la carte menu. These lodges also have poolside bars where you can grab a cold drink (try a Tusker!). Keep in mind though: eating at a lodge won’t be cheap (it’s usually around $40\/person for lunch or dinner!). \n\nIf you plan to stay at a lodge in the park, they usually offer some sort of meal package that includes packed lunches for your day of game driving.\n\nIf you are staying in Nakuru town, see the page ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nakuru"],["here"]]}," for some restaurant suggestions.\n\nIf you are camping inside the park, you should also bring all your own food and supplies.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Lodging"]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["In the park"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Lake Nakuru Lodge"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.lakenakurulodge.com"],["email=nakuru@lakenakurulodge.org"],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=(254-051) 850228\/850518"],["tollfree="],["fax=(254-051) 216250"],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=Spacious rooms, beautiful view, good service, fine cuisine.
