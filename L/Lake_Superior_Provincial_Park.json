Marie for the need to protect a significant portion of the Lake Superior shoreline. From Lake Superior’s rugged coast, this park moves inland over mist-shrouded hills and deep canyons whose breathtaking beauty and rich autumn colours inspired Canada’s Group of Seven artists. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\nThe park's high, rounded hills are the remains of ancient mountain ranges, worn down by glaciers and covered by glacial sediments. Rushing rivers drop rapidly from the highlands to the shoreline, creating rapids and dramatic waterfalls. Faults shaped the magnificent Agawa Canyon, Agawa Rock, and Old Woman Bay. \n\nThe most common rocks in the area are granite and gneisses. Lava rock from Precambrian volcanic activity, diabase dykes along the shoreline, and relatively young Cambrian sandstone, are all relics of the park's geological past. \n\nThe park is situated in a transitional zone between two forest regions—the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence, and the Boreal. The transition is particularly striking in the autumn when the brilliant colours of the southern deciduous trees contrast with the dark green boreal evergreens.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\nThere is a large abundance of wildlife in the park. Larger mammals include moose, commonly seen in the park, timber wolf, Canada lynx, bears, and white-tailed deer, whose numbers are limited because of deep snow and severe winters; smaller mammals include red squirrel, red fox, beaver and marten. More than 250 species of birds have been identified inside the park boundaries, and 120 species nest there. Great blue heron, gulls, loons and several varieties of warblers are among the most common feathered residents.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nPassenger trains operated by CN ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.agawacanyontourtrain.com"]}," provide the only access to the Agawa Canyon and some of the canoe routes along the eastern park boundary.
