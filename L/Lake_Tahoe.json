If you've never installed chains, the convenience of paying an expert do the job in less than five minutes may outweigh the amount of money you save while shuddering in the cold, hunched over the instructions for half an hour. The choice is entirely yours; a good method of learning how to install chains is to watch someone do it the first time so that you know how it to do it yourself the next time---just consider the $30-$35 your lesson fee.

If you are planning to fish in California and are under the age of 16 a fishing license is not required, or if you are on the Nevada side of Lake Tahoe and are under the age of 12 you will not need a fishing license either. Fishing licenses can be purchased at several charters throughout Lake Tahoe. Fishing is prohibited from 2 hours after sunset to 1 hour before sunrise.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]}," \n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sacramento"]]},", the California state capital with excellent restaurants and attractions "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Reno"]]},", in Northern Nevada, home of gambling and the University of Nevada, Reno"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["California Wine Country"]]}," "]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["39.091667"],["-120.041667"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Sierra Nevada"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usableregion"]]},"\n\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Lake Tahoe"]]}]
