The shorter path takes 45 minutes to an hour to get to the top, following a switchback trail through some pine forest, while the longer path (taking 1.5-2 hr) climbs more gradually along the lake shore, before doubling back to climb up to the top from the north. At the top of the hill you can follow a short loop track around the observatory for excellent views toward the Southern Alps, or stop at the cafe there for some excellent hot chocolate.\n\nAnother 1.5-2 hr hike - the Peninsula Walkway - starts a short bit north of Mt John (most easily reached by car), and takes you around the peninsula which lies halfway along the length of the lake. This is a relatively new hike, and the path hasn't really been worn out yet. Make certain you're following the poles rather than sheep tracks which can divert in different directions altogether. This hike is closed from October to December for lambing.\n\nThere are also various organized activities: \n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Tekapo High Country Trek"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.alpinerecreation.com\/highcountry.html"],["email=climb@alpinerecreation.com"],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+64 3 680-6736"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=3-day guided alpine walk in the foothills of the Southern Alps, overlooking Lake Tekapo."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Backcountry Ski Touring"]}," 2-5 days based at hut above snowline, touring the valleys, ridges and basins of the Two Thumb Range.
