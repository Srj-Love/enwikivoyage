The city is in the middle of a long, narrow region known as the Lake Wales Ridge. The Lake Wales Ridge was the first part of the Florida Peninsula to rise above sea level, beginning as a series of small sandy islands not unlike the Florida Keys today. It is a unique environment from its surrounding and home to several endemic species, such as the gopher tortoise and scrub jay. The city of Lake Wales lies at the southern foot of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Iron Mountain"]},"—the second-highest  point on the Florida Peninsula at 295 ft (90 m)—and is home to famous Bok Tower Gardens and its Singing Tower. Near the center of town lies ",{"type":"''","value":["Lake Wailes"]},". The city is small, but much of the rural area extending east and southeast of town is considered as part of Lake Wales and included in this guide.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nThe city was first surveyed in 1879 by Sidney Irving Wailes, who changed the name of a lake—then known as Watts Lake—to Lake Wailes. The city was incorporated in 1911 as Lake Wales (the lake remains known as Lakes Wailes). In the 1920s, the town became a popular winter home for affluent residents from northern states. This resulted in the construction of many historical buildings which remain today in downtown and also in the construction of Bok Tower Gardens.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Forecast"],["Lake Wales"],["27.904722"],["-81.584167"]]},"\n\nLake Wales' climate is much the same as the rest of Central Florida (except coasts). Summers are hot and humid, with highs around 90-95°F (33-35°C) and lows around 74-78°F (23-26°C). During the summer, onshore winds from both coasts travel inland, heat up, rise and build into thunderstorms, usually along a rough line. Lying in the center of the state, the lines of storms (each called a \"seabreeze\") sometimes collide, resulting in strong thunderstorms with frequent lightning and tornadoes (small EF0-1s...not like the powerful tornadoes in the Plains states), 50+ mph winds, and hail possible. Strong storms are usually preceded by cooler winds caused by the rain-cooled air (cold air sinks) rapidly flowing away from the storm. The temperature after a strong thunderstorm passes can drop from 95°F (35°C) to 75°F (24°C) and since the storms can be fairly small, you can drive 5 miles and the temperature will drop\/rise 20°F (10°C) between rain-cooled and surrounding areas.\n\nWinters are mild, with highs in the 70s (°F; 21-27°C) and lows in the 50s (°F; 10-15°C). Lows in the 30s (°F; 0-5°C) are common after cold fronts and there are usually a handful of lows below freezing each winter, although that requires clear skies, so it usually warms very rapidly after sunrise (30°F\/−1°C at 6AM, 55°F\/13°C by noon is typical). Cold fronts occasionally pass by as squall lines, so tornadoes in December or January are not unusual. Snow is extremely rare; the last measurable snowfall was in 1977, although sleet\/wintry mix fell in an unusually cold January 2010. \n\nSpring and fall are transition periods, with spring tending to be the driest months of the year.\n\nIn 2004, Lake Wales was hit by ",{"type":"''","value":["three"]}," hurricanes: Charley, Frances, & Jeanne.
