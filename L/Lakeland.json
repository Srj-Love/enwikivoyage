It was incorporated 1 January 1885. The town was founded by Abraham Munn (a resident of Louisville, Kentucky), who purchased 80 acres (320,000 m2) of land in what is now downtown Lakeland in 1882 and platted the land for the town in 1884. Among the names considered (and rejected) for the town by its residents were Munnville, Red Bug and Rome City.\n\nIn April 1898, the Spanish-American War began and started a crucial point in Lakeland's development. While the war ended quickly and had little impact on most of the nation, the Florida peninsula was used as a launch point for the war and the then small town of Lakeland would house over 9,000 troops.\n\nThe Florida boom resulted in the construction of many significant structures in Lakeland, a number of which are today listed on the National Register of Historic Places. This list includes the Terrace Hotel, New Florida Hotel (Regency Tower, currently Lake Mirror Tower), Polk Theatre, Promenade of Lake Mirror, Polk Museum of Art (not a product of the 20's boom), Park Trammell Building (formerly the Lakeland Public Library and today the Lakeland Chamber of Commerce), and others. The city also has several historic districts with many large buildings built during the 1920s and 1940s. The Cleveland Indians held spring training there from 1923 to 1927 at Henley Field Ball Park. Parks were developed surrounding Lake Mirror including Barnett Children's Park, Hollis Gardens, and the newest, Allen Kryger Park.\n\nThe \"boom\" period went \"bust\" quickly, and years passed before the city recovered. Part of the re-emergence was due to the arrival of the Detroit Tigers in 1934 for spring training. (The team continues to train at Lakeland's Joker Marchant Stadium and owns the city's Florida State League team, the Lakeland Flying Tigers.) The development of the Lakeland Municipal Airport as a major facility in central Florida transportation was another factor. The 1930s also featured the arrival of renowned architect Frank Lloyd Wright. In 1938 he came to Lakeland at the request of Florida Southern College President Ludd Spivey to design a \"great education temple in Florida.\" For 20 years Wright worked on his \"true American campus\" creation. In his original master plan he called for 18 buildings (and several other structures), nine of which were completed and nine left on the drawing board. All of the buildings were built out of what Wright called his \"textile block system,\" the first use of such a system in Florida. He called his project \"A Child of the Sun,\" so named from the architect’s own description of being \"out of the ground, into the light, a child of the sun.\" It is the largest one-site collection of Frank Lloyd Wright buildings in the world, and in many ways helped to form a pattern for many colleges in Florida and other areas of the country in the future years.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Forecast"],["Lakeland"],["28.06"],["-81.96"]]},"\n\nLakeland—like all of Central Florida—has a humid, subtropical climate. Summers are generally hot and humid, with highs above 90°F from May-September although, oddly enough, the temperature seldom surpasses about 96°F (which results in a month like July, where the average high is 95°F and the all-time record for the month is just 5° higher at 100°F). Early morning lows are usually in the mid-70s °F (around 23°C) but the humidity is usually around 90-100% at sunrise, so mornings can be steamy. Beginning in early or mid-June, the rainy season lasts until mid to late September, during which time thunderstorms (sometimes severe) are a regular afternoon event. June, July, & August average over 7 in (178 mm) of rain per month, with September falling to a respectable 6.33 in (161 mm) of rain. Winters are mild with average highs in the 70s °F (around 22-25°C) and lows in the 50s °F (around 11-15°C). Highs may occasionally surpass 80°F (27°C), while lows in the 40s (5-10°C) aren't uncommon. Winter weather is punctuated by occasional cold fronts, which can knock highs into the 60s °F (16-20°C) or even 50s °F (11-15°C) and night-time lows into the 40s °F (5-10°C) and 30s °F (0-4°C). Lows below freezing (32°F, 0°C) occur, on average, just 2 times a year (very rarely below 28°F\/-2°C). Spring and fall are transitional seasons between summer\/winter temperatures. February-May are the driest months of the year, averaging 2-3 in (50-80 mm) of rain, but in drier years these months may see less than 0.5 in (13 mm) of rain. \n\nLakeland can be impacted by tropical storms and hurricanes during Hurricane Season (1 Jun-30 Nov). Tropical storms in Central Florida can bring heavy rains (several inches in a 24 hour or less time span) and potentially a squall line. As with any storm, there is danger involved with minor flooding, lightning, tornadoes, and trees falling down, but for most people tropical storms are just a nuisance for a day or two. The effects of hurricanes varies with each storm, depending on location, size, strength, and other factors. Hurricanes Dennis & Ivan, which passed well off the west coast, brought squall lines in outer bands that swept over the region, bringing strong winds (50-80 mph or 80-130 km\/h) and isolated tornadoes. In 2004, Hurricanes Charley (Category 2), Frances (actually a strong Tropical Storm when it reached Lakeland), and Jeanne (Category 1) all passed through Polk County, within 25 mi of Lakeland, bringing moderate destruction. However, these were the first hurricanes since Hurricane Donna in 1960 to pass through Polk County, so fortunately they are not a common occurrence.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nLakeland lies along ",{"type":"'''","value":["Interstate 4"]},", the main East-West highway across ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Central Florida"]]},". \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nLakeland and northwestern Polk County are closer to ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Tampa#By plane"],["Tampa International Airport"]]}]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["TPA"]]},"; ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.tampaairport.com\/"]},") which is served by all major airlines and has flights nationwide and to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Canada"]]},", the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Caribbean"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]},". To get to Lakeland, follow signs to get onto Interstate 275 East (via a short drive on SR 60\/Veteran's Expressway), go past downtown and get on Interstate 4 East. While State Road 60 is a major route across Polk County, it runs through urban areas for about 20-25 mi, including downtown Tampa, between T.I.A. and Polk County. Lakeland is about 35 mi and Winter Haven (via Polk Parkway\/S.R. 570 ",{"type":"<","value":["nowiki",["[toll&nbsp;$1.50]"]]}," & Winter Lake Rd\/S.R. 540) is about 55 mi.

O.I.A. is one of the nation's busiest airports and Orlando is the top tourism destination in the U.S. As a result, there are hundreds of flights each day connecting Orlando with destinations big and small nationwide as well as Canada, Europe, Latin America, and the Caribbean. The airport also has one of the largest rental car fleets in the country, with several companies and a wide range of vehicles to chose from. To get to Lakeland, exit the South exit from the airport to the Central Florida GreeneWay (S.R. 417), head south ($2.50 in tolls) to get on Interstate 4 heading west (towards \"Tampa\"). \n\nThe city's airport, ",{"type":"'''","value":["Lakeland Linder Regional Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["LAL"]]},"; ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.lakelandairport.com\/"]},"), is capable of handling scheduled, commercial flights , but is currently not served by any airline. The airport has only had commercial flights for 10 months between June 2011 & April 2012. The air taxi operator Atlantic Airlines (",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.atlanticairlines.com\/"]},"; +1-800-879-0000) offers air taxi service to 87 airports (",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.atlanticairlines.com\/system.html list"]},") throughout Florida, including both large airports and smaller municipal airports. Their aircraft accommodate 2 passengers plus their luggage. Flights operate based on demand, not a regular schedule, and can be booked as soon as 4 hours before departure, if aircraft are available, and don't require reaching the airport 2 hours in advance for screening & check-in. The convenience comes at a price, an example one-way fare from Lakeland-Key West is $957 for 1 passenger or $478\/person for 2 passengers.

A special play area for younger children is enclosed with a latching gate for peace of mind.  Bright colors, mosaic wildlife scenes, animal sculptures and unique play structures beckon children.  Plenty of seating is available to take a break.  Keep a keen eye out for all of the artistic details in the tiles on the ground and the large sculptures that can be found around the lake. Festivals and movies on the Promenade are held throughout the year, as well as weddings and other special events.  Grab a bite to eat at the Garden Bistro for lunch or the Texas Cattle Company steakhouse for dinner.
