Most of its existing housing stock was built in this timeframe, and is surprisingly well maintained.  Lakewood has managed to retain many of the best features of a city, small town, and suburb, and scenes reminiscent of all three can easily be found within a few blocks of downtown Lakewood (Detroit Ave. between Cook and Bunts) as well as the Gold Coast neighborhood.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nBy car: from the airport, follow Ohio 237 north; from most parts of Cleveland proper, take I-90 or Ohio 2 west and follow the signs.  RTA bus #26 serves both Lakewood and Cleveland along Detroit Avenue, and the Red Line features two stops just inside the Lakewood\/Cleveland border, West 117 and Triskett Road, from which one can easily walk to the southeastern neighborhoods of Lakewood.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe areas of Lakewood of most interest to a visitor, notably the downtown area, are very walkable and bike-friendly neighborhoods.  If coming from Cleveland, the #26 bus runs relatively frequently down Detroit Avenue and takes about 45 minutes between downtown Lakewood and downtown Cleveland.  Driving in and around Lakewood is fairly easy as well.  Please note that the speed limits are 20 in school zones and 25 on most other streets, and are vigorously enforced.  Parking is limited in and near the downtown area, though paid garages and metered parking are available almost everywhere.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Beck Center for the Arts"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address=17801 Detroit Ave"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Local theatre often featuring Kevin Kelly: VERY NICE."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Lakewood Park"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address=14532 Lake Avenue"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Gorgeous park with amazing views of Lake Erie.
