(RAMSAR area).\n\nIn the migrating period some species are very numerous, especially Knot (Calidris canutus), Dunlin (Calidris alpina) and Bar-tailed Godwit (Limosa lapponica). A great part of the Norwegian population of the rare species Lesser White-fronted Goose (Anser erythropus) rests in the area during migrating periods. The reserve is also an important moulting area for many species of ducks, and a winter habitat for Eider (Somateria mollissima).Within the protected area we find some of the largest salt and brackish marshes in Northern Norway with many arctic plant communities.\n\nIn a part of the reserve, the Valdak Marshes (Valdak myra), all traffic is prohibited from Maand from August 10th to September 20th.
