Its central building is modelled on an Oxbridge quadrangle and was completed in 1827. Lampeter University is the third oldest university in Britain, after Oxford and Cambridge.\n\nThe earliest written reference to Lampeter is believed to be 1187, when Owain Gwynedd destroyed the English King's castle of Pont Steffan ('Stephen's Bridge' in Welsh). The castle's remains later formed the foundations for the college building and still forms part of the university campus.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["From ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]}," (Paddington Station), train to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Carmarthen"]]}," (a few trains are direct, but generally  will need to change in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Swansea"]]},").
