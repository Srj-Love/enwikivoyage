Its first ruler was Queen Chamthewi who was of Mon extraction. In the late 12th century, King Mengrai overran the town and subsequently integrated it into the Lanna Kingdom.\n\nToday, Lamphun still retains its enchanting ambience of a small but old community. It is some 670 km from Bangkok and only 26 km from Chiang Mai. Located on the banks of the Kuang River, its attractions include ancient sites and relics as well as forests and mountains and delightful lakes.
