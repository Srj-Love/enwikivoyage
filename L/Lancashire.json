Less visited as a tourist destination than the neighbouring (and friendly rival) county of Yorkshire, Lancashire is often simply associated with its history as one of the focal points of the Industrial Revolution, and wrongly considered to be heavily built up and industrial.

It remained inaccessible until late in the twentieth century and is almost completely unchanged. The southern part of Bowland bordering onto the Ribble Valley, around Stonyhurst College, was the inspiration for Tolkien's vision of Middle Earth in 'The Hobbit'.

Conversely, the coastal towns developed into holiday resorts for the textile mill workers, including ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Blackpool"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Morecambe"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southport"]]},".\n\nThere are, however, many beautiful rural areas, mainly upland. Most of these are ideal for walking, in particular the Pennine hills and foothills to the east, and the spectacularly beautiful Forest or Trough of Bowland in the heart of Lancashire.\n\nCharles Nevin's book ",{"type":"'''","value":["'Lancashire:Where Women Die of Love"]},"' (Mainstream Publishing) describes many of the charming eccentricities of the county, including its friendly rivalry with neighbour ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yorkshire"]]}," which dates back to the ",{"type":"'''","value":["War of the Roses"]}," when the two royal houses of Lancaster (Red Rose) and York (White Rose) vied for the English throne.

From very early, they lay within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire, and many Mancunians in particular still consider themselves Lancastrians. In 1889, the cities, along with most of the large Lancashire towns, became county boroughs, running their own affairs separate from Lancashire County Council. In 1974, the Local Government Act 1972 came into force and created two new Metropolitan Counties.\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Pendle witch trials"]}," of 1612 are among the most famous witch trials in English history. The 12 women accused were charged with murdering 10 people in and around the Pendle Hill area of Lancashire. Most of the accused were tried at Lancaster Assizes in what became known as the Lancashire witch trials. \"The Witch Way\", the Burnley and Pendle bus services from Manchester use a flying witch as its logo. Pendle Hill dominates the landscape of the area and continues to be associated with witchcraft, and, every Halloween, there is a hilltop gathering on the summit.\n\nLancashire is one of only three County Palatines in England, with special authority and autonomy from the rest of the kingdom. In feudal times, Counts Palatine exercised royal authority, and ruled their counties largely independently of the king, though they owed allegiance to him. Nowadays the distinction is largely ceremonial.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nPeople from Lancashire tend to speak English with a Northern accent called Lancastrian.  The accent can differ from one town to another, although non-Brits are unlikely to be able to tell any difference.  Traditional Lancashire accents are rhotic, as are most American and Irish accents.\n\nAs with most of the UK, very few natives speak other foreign languages. However, many ethnic minorities\/immigrants now reside in the county, and languages such as such as Hindi, Urdu, Chinese, Polish and Lithuanian are spoken within those groups.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nYou can reach Lancashire via ferry from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ireland"]]},", by road via the UK motorway network, or you can fly in via airports in Liverpool, Manchester, or Blackpool.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nThe county is well served by motorways. The M6 runs north-south through the county, there are various spur motorways linking the M6 to towns (e.g. the M55 to Blackpool, the M65 to Blackburn and Burnley, the M58 to Merseyside), and the M62 crosses the Pennines to Yorkshire.\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Leeds-Liverpool Canal"]}," is a picturesque but slower way to travel in Lancashire.\n\nLancashire is increasingly a ",{"type":"'''","value":["cycle friendly"]}," place, for both on and off road cyclists.
