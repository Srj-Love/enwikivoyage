The name \"Pennsylvania Dutch\" is actually a mispronunciation of \"Deutsch\" or German. The Anabaptists originally came from Switzerland and were welcomed to Pennsylvania by William Penn and his descendents.\n\nAlthough Lancaster county thrives on tourism, the Amish community does not particularly like visitors, tourists, or sightseers. They are generally an intensely private religious community doing their best to go about living according to the ways of their religion and culture, and very much wish to be left alone unless you are invited. Don't take photos without permission, or harass or otherwise pester them about their way of living. Above all else, don't trespass on private property.\n\nThere are official tourist exhibits set up by the local government and various private enterprises that will allow you to learn about the county and the Amish in a way that is respectful and positive for everyone involved.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nAmish have some of their own vocabulary, related to German (Pennsylvania Deutsch).

Follow Route 30 East from Lancaster for 3 or 4 miles and make a right turn when you come to Rt 896.  It will be directly past the outlet centers.  This road will take you to the little town of Strasburg which is a very picturesque place in its own right.  Along the way, you will see numerous farms and probably a decent number of horse and buggies.
