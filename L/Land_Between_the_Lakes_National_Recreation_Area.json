The Tennessee River was dammed to make ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kentucky Lake"]]}," and the Cumberland River to make ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lake Barkley"]]},". A canal between the two lakes was dug at Grand Rivers, creating an inland peninsula.  The federal government purchased all of the land between the lakes to create Land Between The Lakes (LBL), a 170,000-acre national\nrecreation area.  Land Between the Lakes offers all the outdoor recreation “basics” with opportunities for environmental and historic interpretation.  Experience the environment through hands-on excitement at LBL. LBL has many hiking and biking trails, horseback riding, an off-road vehicle area, camping, drag boat racing and much more.  Grand Rivers is the only community that fronts on both ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kentucky Lake"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lake Barkley"]]},". Water recreation is nearly limitless in this area and so is camping, hiking, biking and other outdoor recreation.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nThe history of the recreation area is tied to the Tennessee Valley Authority.  Established in 1933 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the TVA was tasked with bringing flood control, power generation, and river navigation to the waterways of the Tennessee River valley.  After the Great Flood of 1937, the TVA began land acquisition in order to build a dam on the Tennessee River near Grand Rivers, KY.  The dam was completed in 1945 and the resulting impoundment of water was named Kentucky Lake.  Shortly after, the US Corps of Engineers began constructing a dam on the nearby Cumberland River with the aim of connecting the navigable waters of the Cumberland with the Tennessee.  To accomplish this, a canal was constructed between the two rivers.  The dam was completed in 1966 and the resulting lake was named Lake Barkley after Alben Barkley, a Kentucky native and Vice President of the United States under President Harry S. Truman.  By 1963, all of the land between the two lakes had been acquired by the federal government and President John F. Kennedy signed legislation creating the recreation area and giving control of the land to the TVA.  In 1998, the administration of Land Between the Lakes National Recreation area was transferred to the US Forest Service.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\nThe landscape of LBL is rugged, hilly, and covered with a mixed oak-hickory forest.
