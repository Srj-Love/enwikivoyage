Not even 30 years later it already became residence, and after the division of the duchy of Bavaria in 1255 the capital of Lower Bavaria. In the 15th century the famous ",{"type":"''","value":["Landshut Wedding"]}," took place, one of the most splendid festivities of the Middle Ages. At the beginning of the 16th century Lower Bavaria and Upper Bavaria were reunited. Although Landshut at that point lost its status as capital, the 16th century was the city's architectural boom era. After that, Landshut lost most of its significance, besides a short time of importance in the beginning of the 19th century, when the University of Bavaria resided a mere 26 years in Landshut.\n\nFor a brief time towards the end of World War II, a subcamp of the Dachau concentration camp was located near Landshut. During the war Landshut only had to suffer one major Allied bombing, when the area around the train station was heavily hit. However, most parts of the city were virtually unharmed by the war, and much of the medieval city center is still intact today.\n\nSince the opening of the new Munich International Airport close to Landshut in 1992, the city has become an attractive business location.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.munich-airport.de\/EN\/ Munich International Airport"]}]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["MUC"]]},"), Europe's sixth busiest airport, is located 40 km (25 mi) to the west of Landshut.
