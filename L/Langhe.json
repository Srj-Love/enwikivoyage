The difficult but noble ",{"type":"'''","value":["nebbiolo"]}," grape is used in Langhe to make two of the best wines in the world, Barbaresco and Barolo, \"the king of wines and the wine of kings\". There have been attempts to export the grape, but so far the resulting wine has failed to reach the quality of the nebbiolo wines of Langhe.\n\nOther interesting red wines include barbera and the simpler dolcetto. White wines are not as famous, but among others arneis and chardonnay are produced. There are also unusual local varieties such as freisa, used to make a lightly sparkling red wine, and grignolino. The moscato grape is used to make above all a low-alcohol dessert wine.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThere are few important sights.

Good places to admire them are La Morra and the castle in Grinzane Cavour (housing the regional wine cellar and a restaurant).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nIf you are really interested in wine, it pays off to go visit a producer for a tour and a tasting. Like everywhere, visiting wineries in the Langhe is like visiting a working farm.  It is a good idea to call ahead before you show up, but it may be possible to taste wine without an appointment at some wineries.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Pio Cesare Azienda Agricola"],["url=http:\/\/www.piocesare.it\/"],["email="],["address=Via Cesare Balbo 6, Alba"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+39 0173 440386"],["tollfree="],["fax=+39 0173 363680"],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Azienda Agricola Vigna Rionda (Massolino)"],["url=http:\/\/www.massolino.it\/"],["email="],["address=Piazza Cappellano 8, Serralunga d'Alba"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+39 0173 613138"],["tollfree="],["fax=+39 0173 613949"],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=La Spinetta"],["url=http:\/\/www.la-spinetta.com\/"],["email="],["address=Via Carzello 1, Grinzane Cavour"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+39 0173 262291"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=Tasting 15€ (4 wines) or 20€ (6 wines)"],["content=A modern producer famous for its Pin blend and its Barolo."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Cavallotto Fratelli"],["url=http:\/\/www.cavallotto.com\/"],["email="],["address=Via Alba-Monforte, Bricco Boschis, Castiglione Falletto"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+39 017362814"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Many classic Langhe wines made in a traditional style: Barolo, Barbera and Dolcetto among others.
