It is said that the provincial borderline runs through the middle of town with Sertri Gompa in Gansu and Kirti Gompa located in Sichuan. The power struggles between the two Gompa may have been the reason for the border location. Both temples have distinct styles making both well worth the visit alone. The sutrounding mountains give off a very much alpine flair reminiscent of rural Austria or Bavaria and perfect for hiking and horsetreking.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThere is only one bus every day from Xiahe direct to Langmusi leaving at around 7AM from the Xiahe Bus Station. \n\nIf you miss this bus, or if you can't get tickets, you can take any early morning bus to Hezuo (1 hour from Xiahe) and then take one of the Hezuo（合作）buses to Langmusi. There are a couple buses from Hezuo to Langmusi each day. There definitely is one leaving at 10:20AM.\n\nWhen you get to Hezuo, you will need to take a taxi across town to the South Bus Station (Nan Zhan – 南站) where the buses leave for Langmusi. \n\nIf you were thinking of hiring a car to take you directly from Xiahe to Langmusi, be ready to pay a lot of money. It will cost you at least ¥350 to hire a car for the trip. The bus is only ¥30-40 per person.  If you do end up taking a taxi, be sure to ask to take the \"scenic route.\"  The road is a little bumpier than the new highway, and a takes a little longer, but you pass beautiful grasslands, mountains, and tibetan villages along the way.\n\nThere are also direct buses to Zoige (Ruo'ergai) in northern Sichuan. There is currently no direct bus to Songpan but the situation may change, as a new highway was completed in 2007.\n\nYou can also catch a bus in Jiuzhaigou to Langmusi. There are multiple buses leaving every morning between 7am and 8am. The bus will let you off on the main road outside of Langmusi, not actually driving into town, leaving you with a 1+ km walk, or there will be cars around to get you into town (for a few yuan).\n\nTo get out of town up towards Xiahe, there is only one afternoon direct bus a day. You can get morning buses to Hezuo, then a cab to the West Bus Station, then catch a bus to Xiahe. There are many buses to Xiahe each day.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nYour own two feet, a bicycle or maybe a pony.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Sertri Gompa"]}," (Dacanglangmu Saichisi) - temple where traditional Tibetan sky-burials are still practiced (last rites are private), located on northern hill."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Kirti Gompa"]}," (Dacangnama Ge'erdisi) - temple on the southern hill"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hui Mosque"]}," - located close to the Sichuan side temple near the entrance gate"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Wind Horse Trekking"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.windhorse-trekking.com"],["email=shanglyila@hotmail.com"],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=next to Nomads Youth Hostel on the main street"],["phone=+86 151-0944-1588"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Offers guided horse treks from one to three days into the beautiful surrounding grasslands, hills, and valleys.

Ask around in Leisha's restaurant. Langmusi Horse Trekking also offers anything from 1 to 3 day horse treks where you can stay with Tibetan nomads. The lady at the horse trekking place speaks excellent English.\n\nThe end of the village closest to the main road is more Westernised, and closer to the monastery it becomes less so. The Sichuan side of town has just put in a brand new road so one hopes the Gansu side will follow suit. Passing through the monastery takes you up into the surrounding mountains, and there are various possible routes available to reach the summits and highs tablelands (4200m), though take care not to stray too far from a used trail or else you may have to retrace your steps to rejoin a viable route. Wild dogs live in the area and you may spot some while walking, grab a rock if need be.\nA school can be found near to the monastery, with private housing and a small playground.\n\nIf walking in the other direction from the village - towards the main road - one encounters an interesting sandstone formation or mesa whose top is accessible.
