It is a unique combination of environments (mangroves, sand dunes, the Senegal River, the Langue de Barbarie, tidal wetlands, the beach, and the ocean).  Here many different species thrive, crabs, lizards, and over 160 species birds can be found throughout the park.  It is a wonderful place for nature lovers, sightseers, photographers, and bird watchers to visit.  The park is located just 18 km (11 miles) south of Saint-Louis in the region of Gandiol.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nThe Parc National de la Langue de Barbarie (Langue de Barbarie National Park) was established on January 9th, 1976.  The park was created for the protection of important sea turtle nesting sites and is also an important migratory bird sanctuary.  The park is best known for its bird reproduction island and is an important stop on the European bird migration route.  The site hosts over 160 different species of migratory and sedentary birds as well as numerous reptile species, crabs, monkeys and other wildlife.\n \nThe flavor of the park changes throughout the seasons offering a different experience depending on when you visit.  Starting in February, bird populations are busy nesting and raising their young.  This is by far the best time to visit the park.  A trip to the bird reproduction island is an amazing experience.  The gulls and terns gather and nest on the bird island hailing the start of the nesting season.  Clouds of thousands of birds are seen swarming all over the island displaying mating behaviors, building nests, laying eggs, and raising their young.\n \nThroughout the months the birds gradually change, each few weeks a different species of birds nests on the island.  Slender billed gulls, lesser black-backed gulls, Caspian terns, royal terns, and others each take their turn nesting on the island ending in late may.  These birds are not the only frequent visitors to the park, large flocks of pelicans and cormorants can be seen in the area and many small shorebirds pass through on their migration during the spring and fall months.\n \nSummer, wet season, is probably the quietest time at the bird island, but in and around the village resident bird populations are in full breeding plumage and beautiful.  Weavers are busy weaving their majestic little nests and raising their young, the beautiful long-tailed sunbirds are all decked out in metallic green and red, and common if you know where to look.  This is the best time to take a walk near the village in the early morning hours, if you contact the park guides the day before, they may be willing to guide you on a walking tour.  Take water, your binoculars, and a bird book and plan to come back a bit early as it gets very hot and the birds hide out during the day.\n \nAt the end of the summer to early fall an amazing thing happens, hundreds of pairs of cattle egrets and reef herons begin to nest in the trees just across from the bird reproduction island.  This noisy heronry is quite an amazing site, just don’t get too close.  One of the ways baby herons and egrets protect themselves is to vomit on an apparent predator.  It is quite an unpleasant experience!\n \nFinally, watch for birds while entering the region.  There are a number of wetlands on your drive to the Langue de Barbarie including the Reserve de Guembeul.  During the fall, winter and spring it is quite common to see large flocks of pelicans, flamingos, spoonbills, and other wetland birds throughout the area.  If you are really into birds, try to visit at the end of the month during the bird counts.  The Langue de Barbarie hosts monthly bird counts on the 24th and 28th of each month. \n \nThe 24th is a walking bird count starting at the park headquarters around 7:30AM until roughly 9:30AM  The 28th is an amazing boat bird count starting at the dock next to the Zebrabar around 7:30AM and ending around 11AM  The count goes all the way to the end of the Langue de Barbarie, the former mouth of the Senegal River.  The park guides will not have a lot of time to explain things during the count, but will do so afterwords.  It is a technical bird count and they need to concentrate, you may even be asked to give an estimate of the bird numbers.\n \nAlthough one of the main reasons for founding the park was to protect sea turtles you will probably not see any during your visit to the park.  The turtles only exit the water to lay eggs then leave for the sea again.  The park currently has a sea turtle monitoring program.  During the months of reproduction (July - October) the park conducts walks along the beach in the morning looking for sea turtle tracks.  This year they have found three turtle tracks to date.  Sea turtles are an endangered species, but sometimes you see the carapaces for sale in St. Louis.  Please do not purchase these shells.  It will act as an incentive for people to continue the illegal harvest of these beautiful and endangered animals.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n \nThe Langue de Barbarie or the “Tongue of the Barbar” (the Barbars are an ethnic group from Maracco who lived on the Langue for over 100 years) is a narrow peninsula which extends southward from St. Louis and used to end several kilometers south of Mouit.\n \nThe ecosystem of the river has changed dramatically over the last few decades.  During the night of October 3rd, 2003 a canal was made 5km south of St. Louis through the Langue de Barbarie.  The canal was cut to help reduce flooding in the city of St. Louis.  It started out just 10 meters wide but rapidly grew to about 1 km in size.  It was made without first conducting an environmental impact study and the ecological and economic repercussions have been drastic.  The ecological balance of the region has completely changed and further compromises the quality of life for the people of Gandiol.\n \nAfter just six months the natural mouth of the river closed, moving the mouth of the river north to the canal.  This is causing major problems.  Because of the geology and hydrology of the region, the mouth of the Senegal River is always moving south.  Just off the shore of this part of Senegal, the ocean current is pushing sand southward.  For a long time the mouth of the river was fairly stable and in 1920 the mouth of the river was located just south of Mouit.  Fort Balacoss was constructed to keep watch over the mouth of the river and a cannon was placed at the village of Guénye Gué to protect the mouth of the river from ships entering to go to St. Louis.\n \nThe mouth of the river was maintained near this location because the current from the river was strong enough to keep up with the pressure of the ocean current.  However, a dam was constructed near Rosso (to stop salt water from seeping into land further up river) changing the output of the river and allowing the mouth of the river to push southward very quickly.  You can see from old maps at the park just how quickly this occurred.  Now history is about to repeat itself because the new mouth of the river is beginning to push southwards, unless something is done to stop it, it will be a matter of decades before the mouth of the river arrives at Mouit.  This is a concern of the population as it would further disrupt the fragile fishing and farming practices in the region and destroy the ecology of the Langue.  The loss of precious trees and turtle nesting beach would be devastating for the park and other wildlife living there.  On the other hand, it may reverse some of the other problems the people living in the region now face.\n \nThe canal dramatically increased the level of salt in the river and soil of Gandiol pushing fields further and further from town.  If you take just a short walk into the bush surrounding the village you can see that field after field have been abandon.\n \nThe canal has increased erosion of vital infrastructures such as roads and to the birds’ reproductive island (the park’s principle tourist attraction).  This is due to the fact that the river was not as susceptible to the tides before the canal was dug.\n \nSince the opening of the canal the species animals which use the river has changed.  There has been a scarcity of fish in the river and the freshwater fish have moved on, being replaced by saltwater species.\n \nA combination of the these factors in addition to the lack of infrastructure and income generating opportunities in the village has created an upward slope in urban migration in which, the educated and working-aged men, and to a lesser extent women, have migrated towards city centers like Dakar and St. Louis.  Countless young men and their wives have left Senegal for the Gambia in search of better fishing opportunities.  Increasing numbers of young men risk their lives to take pirogues to Spain or illegally migrate to other European countries where they hope to find work and a good income.  This creates a serious development problem, widening gaps in both education and innovation throughout the region, increasing the workload pressure for women and leaving very little initiative for the youth coming of working age to remain in the village. \n \nMore often than not, it is the women that are left behind in these villages to care for families, raise children, and search for alternative sources of income to support their futures.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\nThe park is rich with wildlife including birds, fish, lizards, pata (red) monkeys, and various other species of animals. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Climate"]},"\nNovember marks the end of the hot season.

Jean-Pierre and Josette and their son Theirry and his wife Samantha.\n\nThis beautiful little campement is located 15km south of St. Louis near the village of Tessinére.  Once in the area you can simply follow the signs to find it.  There are four bungalows available for 2 to 3 people each and a large tent available for rent as well if you are looking for something a little more authentic.\n\nThe campement has a small bar shaped like a mini car (common public transportation throughout Senegal, it looks like a large van and usually has young men hanging off the back), restaurant, pool, souvenir boutique, 4X4 rentals, and several excursions.  They also have pick up and drop off services to the airport in Dakar, for prices and more information see their website.\n\nThierry speaks a little English but no one else at the campement does, so bring your French dictionary and a bottle of mosquito spray (they can be pesky around sunset).  Also if you are taking public transportation such as taxi’s make sure that they know to go to Teranga near Gandiol, Tessinére not the one on Hydrobase.

The owners speak both French and English.  Meals can be purchased at the inn for a reasonable fee.

He loves to have visitors but make sure you arrive before 10PM  He does not speak French or English so you may have to find someone who can help interpret.  While he may not ask for anything in return it would be a nice gesture to offer 2.000 to 5.000 per night or bring the family a nice gift (fruit for example).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Camping"]},"\nThe campground is owned and operated by the écogarde of the Parc National de la Langue de Barbarie.\n\nThis small campground is very basic and perfect for those traveling on a budget.  A tent is not necessary because you can rent them from the park.  Currently there is no electricity so you will need to provide your own source of light for the evening.  They are projected to get electricity sometime in late 2009 or 2010.\n\nThere is a small bathroom with a western style toilet and shower.  You will need to provide your own toilet paper and soap. Grills and a fire ring are available for use and you can probably find someone in the area to purchase wood from.  There are several boutiques in town where you can purchase snacks and supplies or you can order all you meals from the Héron Cendré Restaurant or visit one of the local campements for meals.\n\nCamping: 500 cfa per person per night.\n\nTent rental\n            Small Tent (2 person): 1.500 cfa per night\n            Large Tent (6 person): 3.000 cfa per night\n\nAdd 2.000 per person for the park entry fee (per visit) which you would pay anyway if you were to visit the park.

Simply use common sense and keep valuables locked up.  Overall the Senegalese are an incredibly friendly and hospitable people and you will meet many people who are genuinely interested in just talking to you and making sure you are having an enjoyable time in Senegal. In case of emergency, there is a police station and a hospital located in St. Louis.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Respect"]},"\nThe Senegalese are a very friendly and hospitable group of people. In order to ensure receiving their friendliness, please follow the steps below.\n\nAlways greet and ask how their day is going.\n\nShake hands as a greeting.Warning – there are some men and women from a specific Muslim sec (hibadou) that do not touch members of the opposite sex.Do not be offended if a member of the opposite sex does not shake your hand, it is their culture.Instead clasp your hands together and clutch them to your heart in greeting.\nNever use your left hand to shake hands or give something to someone. It is not respectful.If you have gotten close to a person it is custom to shake their left hand when parting for long periods of time.It is a wrong that must be corrected at some point in the future, so it is a way of saying that you will see each other again someday.\nNever tell a Senegalese that he\/she is lying, even if you know they are.It is considered very rude.\n\nAs a tourist, you will be asked by many people to give money or gifts. Even if you want to, PLEASE DO NOT GIVE OUT MONEY, CANDY, PENS, ETC!!!  By giving local people items you could be making them dependent on foreigners and their aid.  This also encourages the harassment of tourists and hurts tourism in the region.This can cause an already fragile economy to falter even more.  If you really want to give something to the community, please go to the local schools, the écogardes at the park, or ask the campement owners where you are staying if they can help you.  The principal can distribute school supplies to children most in need.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["School supplies needed by children:"]},"\n\nNotebooks\nPens (blue, red, green)\nFolders\nBinders\nProtractor\nCompass (for drawing circles)\nTriangle\nRuler\nColored pencils\nPencil sharpener\nPencils\nErasers\nBooks in French (If you have any that you are no longer want please bring them along and donate them to a local school.   Books in Senegal are very expensive!  Even books in English or other languages are welcome as students may be studying a foreign language.)\nIt costs 4.500 cfa plus school supplies to send a child to school for one year.  That is a very small price to pay but when you have 10 - 20 kids that are dependent on one provider it is impossible to send them all to school.\n\nPeople from developed countries in general carry a lot of guilt because of the income gap.Please don’t let that guilt continue to hold Africa back.Because of donations that were made on the street, I have seen many tourists be swarmed by people asking for things.  These people may not leave the refuge of the campement again, therefore spend no money in town.So you can see these practices can harm the local economy.\n\nCandy is a treat that parents can easily afford.  Kids eat a lot of candy the way it is.Dental hygiene is not the same in Africa as it is in developed countries.  Most people never go to a dentist and many children and adults have rotting teeth early in life.  If you do choose to give a treat give fruit!

They are Quranic students (studying the Quran - Islam).  They are sent to live with marabouts (religious leaders), sometimes far from their homes.  They are very young ranging in age from 4 years old to the early teens.  They are supposed to be begging for food (not money) but times have changed.  Some marabouts exploit the kids and they spend more time begging out on the street than they do studying the Quran.  Most do not go to regular school and this may be the only education they receive.  If you feel the need to give something to a talebè, please consider donating a piece of fruit or some food they do not have to cook, like a piece of bread.  If you donate money you could be contributing to the further exploitation of children.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Disabled and Elderly People"]}," - These people are common beggars and do need your help.  Even Senegalese people give to these beggars.  If you feel like contributing money to someone these people can use your assistance.  They are usually found in the larger cities - not towns.

They carry gourdes or small, plastic dishes, have dreadlocks that are usually under a large stocking cap, wear clothing that is either tie-dyed or are patches or strips of fabric sown together.  They are asking for money to help build a mosque or other causes for their religion.\n\n",{"type":"'''''","value":["Beware:"]},"\nIn some cities and towns there are scam artists who ask tourists to take them to the store and purchase large amounts of groceries.  In general, do not trust these people as they are usually working aged and in good health.  They may just want a free ride.  Use your best judgment, but many of them will say they have a sick child or other problems to make you feel bad and want to help them.  Some may even appear well dressed and educated - just be wary.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Returning"]},"\nGoing back to St. Louis by bush taxi\n\nSimply wait by the main road and flag down taxis.

This was written October, 2009.\n\nEvery hotel in the region also has taxis that they can call to pick you up.  Prices are more expensive then taking the bush taxis but you have the ease of choosing the time of your departure and not having to haul your luggage to the road.  Prices range from 3.000 to 5.000 CFA.\n\nSeveral times throughout the day Ndiaga Ndiayes depart from the market area in Mouit for St. Louis.  Price should be around 300 CFA and they are not on a set schedule although there is usually one around 9:00 am and another around 10:30\n\nEvery day except Sunday's there is an early morning Ndiaga Ndiaye which departs for Thies or Dakar at 6AM  It often runs a little late.  You can catch the bus near the only hardware store in Mouit.  It should be 2.000 CFA each plus no more than 500 for luggage.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Saint-Louis"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usablepark"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["no Wikipedia link"]]}]
