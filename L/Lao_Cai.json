There is one ATM accepting all international cards, but it's neither close to the border nor to the railway station. Motorbike drivers usually know it and will drive you there (one-way 10,000 dong).\n\nAs soon as you leave the immigration building you will be approached by money changers. They usually offer poorer exchange rates than the bank. There are two banks just next to the border and a third one just at the other end of the first bridge, though these are all annoyingly closed at weekends.

While the train station can be found right next to the main road, the bus station is around 300 m southwest of it, down Phan Đình Phùng. Additionally, minibuses are abundant (destinations usually indicated on the windshield), which will drive around town until full and can be flagged down.

Just ignore them and walk to a main street and flag a minibus with a sign showing Sapa at the windscreen. Confirm with the driver or bus attendant 25,000 dong and hop into the minibus to Sapa.\n\nIf arriving by train (usually around 05:30) watch out for minibus scams asking for 200,000 dong upwards.
