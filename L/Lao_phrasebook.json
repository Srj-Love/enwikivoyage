Still, there are 30 consonants, 15 vowel symbols plus 4 tone marks to learn, and the Lao also share the Thai aversion to spaces between words. Lao remains a bit of challenge to pick up, even though it is usually considered easier to learn than Thai.\n\nLao ",{"type":"'''","value":["romanization"]}," is bedeviled by the incompatibility between French and English pronunciation. Most older transliterations are French-based, while newer ones are English-based.  The French-style \"",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vientiane"]]},"\", for example, is more accurately spelled \"Wiang Chan\" in English.

Vowel signs are always written around consonants.\n\nFrench transliterations use \"ou\" for \"u\" (eg. \"L",{"type":"'''","value":["ou"]},"ang Prabang\") and often tag an unpronounced \"e\" at the end of words to stop the consonant from being swallowed (eg. \"Kayson",{"type":"'''","value":["e"]}," Phomvihan",{"type":"'''","value":["e"]},"\").\n\n; i : like in the 'i' in 'nit'\n; ii : like in the 'ee' in 'beer' or 'Feet'\n; a : like in the 'u' in 'bum'\n; aa : like in the 'a' in 'father'\n; ae : like in the 'a' in 'fat'\n; e : like in the 'e' in 'fence'\n; eh : like in the 'a' in 'bait'\n; u : like in the 'u' for 'fruit'\n; ou : like in the 'oo' in 'mood'\n; aw : like in the 'aw' in 'saw'\n; am : like in the 'um' in 'drum'\n; oe : not found in English, but similar to the 'uh' in 'huh'\n; eu : not found in English, but similar to the 'i' in 'sir' or the 'eux' from the French 'deux'\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Consonants"]},"\nLao distinguishes between ",{"type":"'''","value":["aspirated"]}," (\"with a puff of air\") and ",{"type":"'''","value":["unaspirated"]}," (\"without a puff of air\") consonants.  Unaspirated consonants exist in English too, but never alone: compare the sound of 'p' in \"pot\" (aspirated) and \"spot\" (unaspirated). Many English speakers find it helpful to pronounce an imperceptible little \"m\" in front to 'stop' the puff.\n\nIn romanized Lao, the distinction is usually represented by writing aspirated consonants with \"h\" and unaspirated ones without it.
