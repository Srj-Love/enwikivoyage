After a succession dispute, the kingdom split in three in 1694 and was eventually devoured piece by piece by the Siamese, the last fragments agreeing to Siamese protection in 1885.\n\nThe area east of the Mekong, however, was soon wrenched back from Siam by the French, who wanted a buffer state to protect Vietnam, and set up Laos as a unified territory in 1907. Briefly occupied by Japan in 1945, a three-decade-long conflict was triggered when France wanted to retake its colony. Granted full independence in 1953, the war continued between a bewildering variety of factions, with the Communist and North Vietnam-allied ",{"type":"'''","value":["Pathet Lao"]}," struggling to overthrow the French-leaning monarchy. During the Vietnam War (1964-1973), this alliance led the United States to dump 1.9 million tonnes of bombs on Laos, mostly in the northeast stronghold of the Pathet Lao: as a comparison 2.2 million tonnes were dropped on Europe by all sides during World War II.\n\nIn 1975, after the fall of Saigon, the Communist Pathet Lao took control of Vientiane and ended a six-century-old monarchy. Initial closer ties to Vietnam and socialization were replaced with a gradual return to private enterprise, an easing of foreign investment laws and admission into ASEAN in 1997.\n\nDespite being just one hour by air from the hustle and bustle of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bangkok"]]},", life in Laos has continued in much the same way it has for hundreds of years, although things are now slowly beginning to change. In the mid-1990s the government reversed its stance on tourism, and then declared 1998 \"Visit Laos Year\", but despite their efforts and all Laos has to offer, monks still outnumber tourists throughout the country. This is now rapidly changing, with tourist numbers rising every year.

It is also available when entering via Stung Treng (Cambodia), although guesthouses in Cambodia and the Lao embassy in Phnom Phen will pretend that it is not in order to make money with visa services. When applying for a tourist visa or to obtain a visa on arrival, one (maybe two at Lao embassies) passport photo is required although you may be able to pay a USD1 fee for your passport photo to be scanned upon arrival.\n\nPrices range from USD35-42 depending on nationality - Americans USD35, Canadians USD42, Australians USD45, Chileans USD30. As of June 2013, EU countries should pay USD30, with no extra payment for processing except maybe if you forgot to bring a passport picture. Paying in Vietnamese dong, Lao kip, or Thai baht is possible too, but the mark-up means that travellers should try to bring US dollars.\n\nVisas can be obtained in advance from Lao embassies\/consulates. The fee varies by nationality\/embassy; USD20 is common, although can be as high as USD63 (in Kuala Lumpur). Processing times also vary; 2-3 days is typical, though you may be able to pay an extra small amount (around USD5) to receive the visa in as little as one hour. In ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Phnom Penh"]]}," the travel agencies can arrange the visa the same day (but may charge as much as USD58) while getting it from the embassy takes a few days. Getting a visa from the embassy in Bangkok costs around 1,400 baht for most nationalities, plus 200 baht more for \"same day\" processing. It's cheaper and quicker to get one at the border.\n\nVisas are also available at the Lao PDR consulate in Khon Kaen, Thailand. Thai and English (limited) are spoken by consular staff. Hours are Monday-Friday, 08:00-12:00 and 13:00-16:00. Several changes took place in Feb 2012, with prices have increased and are now similar to those charged by the Laotian Embassy in Bangkok.\n\nVisas for Americans, Britons and citizens of several EU countries cost 1,400 baht\/USD45, Australians and New Zealanders pay 1,200 baht\/USD38, Canadians pay 1,700 baht\/USD54 while Chinese pay 600 baht\/USD20. Officially, visas can be picked up the next day, or pay an additional 200 baht to have the visa issued within 1 hour. Officially, only baht is accepted although if you don't have baht, they may take US dollars. Note: a 30-31 baht to the US dollar rate has been reported, making it more expensive than getting one on arrival and paying in US dollars. Given that a visa for many countries can cost USD20-42 at the border, getting a visa at the border is cheaper and quicker. Note: If you are taking the direct Khon Kaen to Vientiane bus and you require a visa for Laos, the bus company will not sell you a ticket unless you have a visa already issued.\n\nThere are Visa-on-Arrival facilities at the international airports in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vientiane"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Luang Prabang"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pakse"]]},", and at all border crossings (see below), including now overland from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cambodia"]]},". Visa on arrival facilities opened at Voen Kham -north of Stung Treng, Cambodia- in February 2010. The cost varies between USD30 and USD42 if paid with US dollars, considerably more if paying with Thai baht and border officials will not accept Lao kip. If you pay in Thai baht, the cost is usually 1,500 baht (about USD47-48). A USD1 \"out of office hours\/overtime\" surcharge at the Friendship Bridge in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vientiane"]]},", and a small possibly 10 baht to USD1 entry stamp fee, might also be charged. \n\nEntry permit extensions (sometimes referred to as \"visa extensions\") are available from the Immigration Department in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vientiane"]]},", the Immigration Department in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Luang Prabang"]]},", the Police Station in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pakse"]]},", and possibly other cities. Extensions are not possible in Lao's second city, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Savannakhet"]]},", although you can do a border run from there to Thailand to get a new 30 day visa. The cost is USD2 per day plus a small \"form fee\" ranging between 5,000 kip (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pakse"]]},") to USD2 (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Luang Prabang"]]},"). The process is very easy; turn up in the morning with your passport and one photo; fill in a form (in Luang Prabang they do this for you) and come back in the afternoon for your extension.\n\nIf you want to extend for longer than two weeks and are near the Thai border, it can be more cost effective to nip over the border (entry to Thailand is free for most western nationalities) and return immediately to get a new 30 day Lao visa.\n\nExtensions are also possible via agencies elsewhere in Laos.

Note that the border is lightly used, with almost no onward public transport available at the border (therefore book through transport from Stung Treng to Ban Nakasang for Si Phan Don\/Don Det) and both customs officers and transport providers have a reputation of gouging foreigners, although this seems to have improved recently (currently both Cambodian and Laos border officials request USD1 stamp fee per country). Crossing the border (Oct 2010) the Cambodia officers will ask for USD1 for exit stamp. You can tell them you don't have any and they will still stamp it. On the Laos side they will demand USD2 for entry stamp, if you refuse they will not stamp it, (you will need the stamp to get out), so you have no choice than to pay the bribe. Note if you cross the border by boat, you will have to return by road to the border checkpoint to officiate your arrival (i.e., get your passport stamped) in Laos.\n\nTwo pitfalls at the Lao-Cambodian border are that you will often have four changes of bus (some of them tiny minibuses where passengers have to sit on each other's laps), and hours spent driving to remote guesthouses to pick up backpackers; if your luggage has been sent in a bus you are not on (because of \"lack of space\") it will sometimes disappear.

Either way, the scenery along the way is gorgeous and unexploited, and Luang Prabang is an incredible city, worth a thousand of these journeys.\n\nThough helpful in saving time, speedboats are not without danger: built to carry 8 passengers, they are often overloaded; the engine noise is well above a healthy level, which could be a serious hazard to your ears, especially if you are on the boat for a long time (as well as causing considerable noise pollution, scaring wildlife and spoiling the peaceful river life); and fatalities resulting from capsize due to incautious maneuvering, or hitting floating logs or hidden rocks, have been reported (and exaggerated by competing slow boat owners, some say...)

Thus, these transactions are much more expensive than the typical charge for withdrawing cash from ATMs in other countries. Euros get pretty bad rates compared to USD when exchanged in Laos, getting a cash advance in USD and changing it to kips might actually save money compared to bringing euros with you to Laos.
