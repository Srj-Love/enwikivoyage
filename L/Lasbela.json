Gadani currently has an annual capacity of breaking up to 125 ships of all sizes, including supertankers which are dismantled and recycled, often with bare hands and welding torches. Gadani is the world's leading ship breaking yard in terms of efficiency. At Gadani, a ship with 5,000 LDT is broken within 30 to 45 days, whereas in Alang and Chittagong, it takes, on average, more than six months for breaking a vessel of the same size. Tourists are not usually welcome, but some travelers have been able to sweet talk the gate-keeper and get amazing photos of massive ships being dismantled for parts and steel. There are many breaking yards stretching for miles, so start at one end and try your luck until you have success."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Naseem Cloth Market"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Balochistan"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Geo"],["25.75"],["66.583333"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Lasbela (Karachi)"]]}]
