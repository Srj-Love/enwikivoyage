Tourists can enjoy the wild beauty of Latvia's unspoilt sea coast, which is 500 km long and consists mainly of white, soft sandy beaches. Forests, which cover approximately half of Latvia's territory, offer many nature trails and nature parks.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nLatvia is a famous ancient trading point. The famous route from the Vikings to the Greeks’ mentioned in ancient chronicles stretched from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Scandinavia"]]}," through Latvian territory along the river Daugava to the Kievan Rus and Byzantine Empire.  Across the European continent, Latvia’s coast was known as a place for obtaining amber. In the Middle Ages amber was more valuable than gold in many places. Latvian amber was known in places as far away as Ancient ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Greece"]]}," and the Roman Empire. In the 12th century, German traders arrived, bringing with them missionaries who attempted to convert the pagan Finno-Ugric and Baltic tribes to the Christian faith. The Germans founded Rīga in 1201, establishing it as the largest and most powerful city on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea.\n\nAfter independence in 1918, Latvia achieved considerable results in social development, economy, industry and agriculture. It has always been a multicultural melting point, where foreigners and locals worked together and brought prosperity to the country.  On 16 June 1940, Vyacheslav Molotov presented the Latvian representative in Moscow with an ultimatum accusing Latvia of violating a pact, and on 17 June Soviet forces occupied the country. Elections for a \"People's Saeima\" were held, and a puppet government headed by Augusts Kirhenšteins led Latvia into the USSR. The annexation was formalized on 5 August 1940. Nazi Germany occupied the country the following year, ruling Latvia until the Soviet Red Army recaptured the country in 1944. Both Nazi Germany and the USSR under Stalin were extremely brutal and murderous: the Nazis and their local collaborators murdered over 200,000 Latvians including 75,000 Latvian Jews, and the Soviets, who also had local collaborators, threw well over 100,000 Latvians into the Siberian Gulags, from which many never returned, and had many thousands of others arrested locally, with some summarily shot or tortured. During the time of the Iron Curtain, Latvia was a province of the Soviet Union, but the concentration of heavy industry was enormous. Contacts with the West were regulated. The Baltic region had the reputation of being the most urbanized and having the highest literacy rate in the Soviet Union.\n\nLatvia regained independence on 6 September 1991. Between 1991 and 2007 the country saw unprecedented economic growth. The global recession and the banking crisis hit Latvia brutally from 2008–2011, and severe economic contraction and destructively high unemployment returned, but the country's economy has recovered well in more recent years.\n\nBecause of a tribal past and divisions between occupying nations, there are regional differences between parts of Latvia which are interesting to explore.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["The best time to travel"]}," to Latvia is from June to mid September, when it is warm and plenty of local food is available.

This is, of course, available mainly in summer and autumn season.\n \nLatvian cuisine comes from its peasant culture, and is based on crops that grow in Latvia's maritime, temperate climate. Rye, wheat, oat, peas, beets, and potatoes are the staples; smoked bacon, sausage, and other pork products are favourites, smoked and raw fish is common. Many types of food are flavoured with caraway seeds, especially cheese and bread. A cheese similar to smoked gouda, but softer, is the cheapest and, arguably, tastiest variety. Latvian rye bread is heavy and flavourful, and goes well with hearty Latvian meals like pea soup, potatoes, and schnitzels. Restaurants in larger cities often offer stews in clay pots.\n\nLatvian cuisine is typical of northern countries, especially close to Finland; it's high on butter, fat, and grains, low on spice except for caraway and black pepper. If you are from the Mediterranean, you might find it bland, but if you come from England or the Midwestern US, you're not likely to have trouble getting used to it.\n\nA more exotic Latvian dish is a sweet soup made from rye bread (maizes zupa).\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Black bread"]}," is extremely important part of Latvian food.
