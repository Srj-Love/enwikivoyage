Like Bath and Cheltenham, Leamington owes much of its grandeur to its development as a fashionable resort in the early nineteenth century, catering for those who believed its spring waters could cure or ease their ailments. \n\nLeamington was laid out as a new town in the early to mid-nineteenth century, with features characteristic of modern planned towns including wide streets based predominantly on a north\/south aligned grid.  It was built on the site of a much smaller and older village called Leamington Priors, from which 2 buildings still remain - situated just East of the parish church.\n\nModern Leamington serves primarily as a commuter town for Coventry and Birmingham, with its population boosted during term time by students from the nearby University of Warwick.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/flycvt.com Coventry Airport"]}]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["CVT"]]},") is about 10 miles \/ 20 minutes journey by car, though was closed to commercial traffic in December 2009. \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Birmingham International Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["BHX"]]},"), ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.bhx.co.uk\/"]}," is larger and not too far away and serves the region with frequent domestic and international flights.
