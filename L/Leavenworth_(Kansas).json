Leavenworth boasts numerous beautiful Victorian homes, such as the Carroll Mansion and several preserved depots that are available for touring.\n\nFort Leavenworth was established in 1827 and is the oldest fort in continuous operation west of the Mississippi River. For the next several decades it played an important role in keeping the peace among the various Indian tribes and the increasing number of settlers heading west. By the 1840s, travel to Oregon and California had begun and thousands of wagons passed through Fort Leavenworth on the way to the Santa Fe and Oregon Trails. Fort Leavenworth is well preserved with many historic sites. The Buffalo Soldier Monument is a magnificent tribute to the 9th and 10th Cavalry of Black Soldiers that were forgotten in history.\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Hyundai Korean Restaurant"],["url="],["email="],["address=749 Shawnee Road"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +1 913-651-2622"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Probably the most authentic ethnic food in town.
