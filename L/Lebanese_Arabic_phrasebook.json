[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Welcome banner.jpg"]]},"\nThe Lebanese dialect of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Arabic phrasebook"],["Arabic"]]}," is similar to that spoken in Syria, Jordan and the Palestinian Territories, somewhat different to that spoken in Egypt, and very different to other forms of Arabic.  As with all dialects of Arabic, the dialect is a spoken language only; the written language always conforms to standard Arabic.\n\nArabic is significantly different from English: different forms are used when addressing males, females and groups; plurals and verb conjugations are highly irregular and difficult to figure out from their roots; and the pronunciation includes some very difficult sounds.  Lebanese, luckily, is a much-simplified from standard Arabic, and should not be overly difficult for the traveler.\n\nLearning some basic Lebanese Arabic dialect expressions could always come in handy; however, knowing either English or French should be enough for a tourist visiting ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lebanon"],["Lebanon"]]},", since many Lebanese people (especially the youth, particularly in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beirut"],["Beirut"]]},") are trilingual.\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Pronunciation guide"]},"\n\nFor some Arabic sounds, there is no easy transliteration (and no single agreed transliteration).  The pronunciation guide shown below is case sensitive; for example, 'th' is a different sound to 'Th' and 'TH'.
