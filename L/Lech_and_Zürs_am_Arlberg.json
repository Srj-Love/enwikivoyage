Queuing might happen during ski school starting hours but normally you don't queue for more than 5 minutes anywhere. There are a number of high level ski schools available for all types of skiers. The Arlberg is the birthplace of the ski schools. There is ski terrain for everybody, from the beginner to the alpine tourer. Best skiing though is in Zurs, (lift linked, but a sleepy place to stay).\n\nLech-Zurs hosts the world's longest ski race known as \"Der Weisse Ringe\" (The White Ring) crossing over 22 km of pistes. Any well acquainted skier can try the run out for themselves. Though it may be started in any of the three towns (Lech, Zurs or Zug), most start in Lech at the Rufikopfbahn which connects over to Zurs. The run is very popular and well illustrated maps can be found just about anywhere.\n\nDuring the Summer months the area is a very popular hiking and wellness destination. It is not unusual to stumble across fossils and other interesting geological finds whilst hiking. The \"Sea of Stone\" hike in particular has plenty of fossil finds as you are literally walking over an ancient coral reef. For those more interested in a trekking-type vacation, one may hike atop the peaks from hut to hut (with cheap dorm-style accommodation and delicious traditional Vorarlberger\/Tyrolean dishes). Rock climbing, canyoning, repelling, mountain biking, etc. are all available. In Lech, these activities are all available to children during their day camps.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nMink, diamonds, cartier, patek phillipe, you get it...\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["buy"],["name=Stroltz department store"],["url=http:\/\/www.strolz.at"],["email="],["address=Dorf 116 & Zürs 205"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=The \"Harrods of Lech\" deserves a visit during your stay."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["buy"],["name=Huber"],["url=http:\/\/www.huber-lech.at"],["email="],["address=Dorf 115"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=A renowned jeweler from Lichtenstein which has a branch in Lech for over 20 years."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["buy"],["name=Sagmeister"],["url=http:\/\/www.sagmeister.at\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=The first address for the fashionable with five boutiques in Lech"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nMany of the hotels offer \"half-board\" accommodation and will provide breakfast and the evening meal.
