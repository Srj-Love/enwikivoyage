It was a market town that became an industrial powerhouse and grew and developed into a service-based city economy with an attractive, smart centre.\n\nRoman Leeds was an important strategic fort, ford and small settlement on the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["York"]]},"-",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chester"]]}," road. Recorded in the Domesday book of 1086, it became a thriving market town in the Middle Ages, gaining its town charter from the King in 1207. The medieval city was based around Briggate, Kirkgate, Swinegate and The Calls. (The ending \"-gate\" came from the old Norse for 'street'.) It was a trading centre in the West Riding of Yorkshire for cloth and wool; from Bradford, Halifax and Huddersfield to the port of Hull, east along the river Aire and the 1699 Aire & Calder Navigation canal. Whilst the town grew rapidly (population over 30,000 in the eighteenth century, when the gracious Georgian West End was built), it was for a long time economically overshadowed by nearby York.\n\nThe industrial revolution brought about massive change as it became a huge manufacturing centre of wool and textiles and a major trading centre (with over half the country's export passing through for a period). Leeds became known as the city of a thousand trades and by the middle of the nineteenth century the population had passed 200,000. Bolstered by the 1816 Leeds-Liverpool Canal and the Leeds-Selby railway in 1835 (The Middleton Railway was the world's first commercial railway, 1758 Railway Act, from The Middleton colliery to coal-staithes (sidings) at Meadow Lane just south of Leeds Bridge), the city continued to grow and prosper rapidly, with grandiose architectural manifestations of the Victorian city's wealth built in abundance, and expanding affluent suburbs to the north. Leeds University was created around the 1880s, bringing an intellectual dimension, and Leeds was served by one of the world's most extensive tram systems (sadly later replaced by buses). Leeds Bridge was the location of the world's first moving images, filmed in 1888 by Frenchman Louis le Prince (who later disappeared in mysterious circumstances), and Leeds was the first city in the world to have a modern traffic light system, the first of which were situated at the junction of Park Row and Bond Street. Leeds was granted city status in 1893.\n\nBy the twentieth century, Leeds's population was approaching 500,000. Whilst Leeds suffered far less than many other large UK cities from the WWII blitz, it was affected by the mass industrial decline of the country in the post-war period, and became characterised by unemployment and huge council estates. Versatility enabled it to survive and it began to prosper in the 1980s, when renovation of the centre and waterfront, and demolition of some of the worst estates began. By the 1990s the city was reborn with wealth based on service industries and commerce, the financial and legal centres making it the most important city in the UK in these areas outside London. With the West Yorkshire Playhouse, Royal Armouries, restoration of the Victoria Quarter and Corn Exchange, the clean up of major historical buildings, the new Harvey Nichols store and new bars, shops and restaurants - all in the mid 90s, the city was truly on the move. The most recent Census (2001) shows Leeds with a population of just over 715,000.\n\nToday, Leeds is still one of the most cosmopolitan, fast-growing, innovative and prosperous cities in the UK with developments springing up by the week and new bars, boutiques, clubs and restaurants seemingly more often, the two universities adding to the vibrancy, and international eateries and shops. \n\nLeeds Visitor Centre is at The Arcade, Leeds City Station.",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.leeds.gov.uk\/page.aspx?pageidentifier=B7626F82D40BEDCF80256E1B002BACDD"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.lbia.co.uk\/ Leeds-Bradford International Airport"]}]},".

Bounded by the 'Public Transport Box', a rough half mile square between The Headrow, Vicar Lane, Boar Lane and Park Row gives Leeds one of the most compact, busy and diverse pedestrian shopping districts in the UK where the highest concentration of the city centre's stores are to be found.\n\nThe principal shopping street is the broad and bustling ",{"type":"'''","value":["Briggate"]}," (recently attractively repaved), where many flagship stores such as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Harvey Nichols"]},", House of Fraser, Debenhams are to be found alongside high-end fashion (e.g. Louis Vuitton) and high street favourites (Topshop, Zara, H&M) etc. Briggate's attractive and eclectic architecture spans three centuries, and the grand shop fronts only add to the streets appeal.\n\nEither side of the top end of Briggate are the city's famous ",{"type":"'''","value":["arcades"]},", splendidly palatial Victorian roofed-over shopping streets home to some of the city's most exclusive and interesting shops. The famous ",{"type":"'''","value":["Victoria Quarter"]}," (Victoria St, County Arcade and Cross Arcade) has some of the most expensive clothes in Leeds. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Queen's and Thornton's arcades"]}," are a little more affordable with more independent stores. Down from the arcades, several medieval ",{"type":"'''","value":["yards"]}," (or \"loins\") run off almost hidden from between shopfronts on Briggate. Whilst some are little more than shop-backs and some are now closed off, some exude genuine historic atmosphere and a few are home to attractive pubs and bars, including The Angel Inn, The Ship, The Bay Horse, Queen's Court and three-hundred-year-old ",{"type":"'''","value":["Whitelocks"]},"'.\n\nBeyond Briggate, there are several other prominent shopping streets, including gorgeously symmetrical ",{"type":"'''","value":["King Edward Street"]}," with its matching Victorian Burmantoft terracotta buildings. Commercial Street, Kirkgate, Lands Lane and Albion St are other principal streets in the area, continuing the mix of ",{"type":"'''","value":["shops, cafés, lovely architecture"]},". There are also several indoor shopping centres, and a central focal point is tiny but busy Central Square at the base of Lands Lane. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Albion Place"]}," is a quieter street of elegant Georgian buildings (mainly offices) including the exclusive ",{"type":"'''","value":["Leeds Club"]}," and the city's central private members library, running between the square and Albion St. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Swan Street"]}," is a quiet and pretty little street between Briggate and Lands Lane with a few attractive little shops, cafés and bars and a laid-back vibe, as well as the internationally famous ",{"type":"'''","value":["City Varieties"]}," theatre and music-hall, once home to Charlie Chaplin.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Exchange Quarter"]},"\n\nCentred on the massive dome of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Corn Exchange"]},", the Exchange Quarter is the centre of Leeds' bohemian life, with one-off boutiques, funky cafés and piercing parlours filling its pretty cobbled streets. It is becoming increasingly chic, however, with a plethora of upscale bars and stylish restaurants, particularly on ",{"type":"'''","value":["Call Lane"]},".\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Corn Exchange"]}," dominates the area, sitting squattly at the junction of several major roads. This grand Victorian building is one of the finest in the city, and was a functioning corn market for several decades, but was almost unused for much of the twentieth century, until its restoration to its present form in the 1980s. It now houses a myriad of little boutiques, a few cafés and market stalls. The goth and emo teenagers that hang around outside frequent many of the shops such as Grin and Exit, but there are also a range of fashion and artisan stores to please all, and the beautiful architecture (the shops fit into the retained 19th-century store-fronts, and the ",{"type":"'''","value":["domed roof"]}," is spectacular from the interior) can be enjoyed by everyone.\n\nThree sides of the Corn Exchange are bounded by semi-pedestrian ",{"type":"'''","value":["cobbled streets"]}," lined by a hotch potch of attractive Victorian buildings home to shops and restaurants from Blue Rinse (see below) to Pizza Express, housed in the beautiful ",{"type":"'''","value":["Third White Cloth Hall"]},", sadly sliced in half by the railway in the mid-nineteenth century, but retaining its lovely façade and clock-tower. Along the railway, the continental feel continues with bars and cafés that spill on to the pavement. Beautiful ",{"type":"'''","value":["Assembly Street"]},", a hub of nightlife, is lined with elegant and imposing eighteenth-century warehouses and has been recently repaved, and in the summer is a relaxing place to sip a coffee or cocktail and admire the buildings and atmosphere. Nearby Crown Street buildings are a fine example of modern architecture at its finest, sympathetic to the surrounding environment but adding a dash of vibrancy with bright use of colour above its restaurants and bars.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Call Lane"]},", the area's main drag, is a hive of activity in the evenings, with several of the city's best and most stylish bars, all vying for attention. In the day-time however it is much quieter, with a few vintage and alternative clothes stores at the Kirkgate end, and musical instrument shops located at the Calls end. There is plenty of enjoyment to be had from wondering around the pretty and historic medieval yards that run between Call Lane and Lower Briggate (at night these too come alive and are full of revelers).\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Kirkgate"]}," is currently a fairly downmarket shopping street with a few off-beat stores. However plans are afoot to refurbish the historic town-houses and bring life back into the street as a centre for independent shops, with the renovation of the dilapidated First White Cloth Hall along similar (if smaller) lines to the Corn Exchange. The east end of Kirkgate and New York Street also increasingly have a number of bars and clubs, including the celebrated Northern Light; there are also several new apartment buildings springing up. The end of Kirkgate is market by Leeds Parish Church, a grand (if not enormous) neo-gothic structure home to one of the country's most revered children's choirs. To the west, Central Road links Kirkgate to Duncan Street, and is home to some attractive Flemish-style buildings, a few off-beat shops and the acclaimed Little Tokyo restaurant and Leeds institution ",{"type":"'''","value":["the HiFi Club"]},". Duncan Street has a number of small shops.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["The Calls"]}," was where riverside life restarted in Leeds, with its renovation from a derelict nowhere to the city's most desirable real estate in the 1980s. The apartments lining the waterfront may not be as exclusive or as rare today, but it is still an attractive and expensive area, home to some of Leeds' longest running high-end establishments including 42 The Calls hotel, Pool Court and the Calls Grill. Some of the waterfront and streets around here are surprisingly yet to be fully renovated, but it's unlikely to be long before developers get their claws into the remaining warehouses, railway arches and mill-cottages. Leeds Civic Trust's ",{"type":"'''","value":["heritage centre"]}," and left-wing arts centre ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Common Place"]}," fill the gap between the Calls and the railway line.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Financial District"]},"\n\nWhilst the Financial District does not have the obvious draws of the Civic Quarter, it is nonetheless an interesting area that deserves at least a little of your time. Roughly bounded by the Headrow and Westgate to the North, the A58 motorway to the West, the River Aire to the South and Park Row to the East, this is the most expensive business real estate in the city. Many large companies have their offices here as well as innumerable lawyers, estate agents, etc.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Park Square"]}," is probably the number one attraction of the area. Situated just south-west of the Town Hall, this large and handsome Georgian Square has lovely formal gardens that fill up with workers at lunchtime in the warmer months. Whilst most of the square is bounded by rows of 18th century redbrick townhouses that made the square one of the city's most fashionable addresses 200 years ago, the South West corner is home to a little-known architectural highlight of Leeds, a converted warehouse (now offices) built in the 19th century as a replication of a ",{"type":"'''","value":["Moorish Palace,"]}," complete with turrets and Islamic-style ornate design. The streets to the south of Park Square are a mixture of Georgian townhouses and more modern office buildings sitting cheek-by-jowl. Whilst not hugely diverting, there are several interesting buildings in this area. Wellington Street, a busy thoroughfare which marks the bottom of the Georgian area, has several restaurants and bars as well as being characterised by more modern business development.\n\nBetween East Parade and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Park Row,"]}," two busy main routes through the area, are a series of parallel streets that are home to some of the city's top restaurants and bars, most famously ",{"type":"'''","value":["Greek Street"]},". There is a rich patchwork of architecture spanning the past two centuries in this small area, with fine Gothic buildings and sleek modern towers. Park Row itself boasts outstanding buildings such as the Leeds Permanent building, blending seamlessly into modern glass building-fronts.\n\nThe south-east corner of the Financial District is ",{"type":"'''","value":["City Square"]},", one of the most important hubs of city life. Recently cleaned up and repaved, the square is still home to bronze nymphs holding gas lights and the famous statue of the Black Prince. The ",{"type":"'''","value":["old post office"]}," is now the swanky Restaurant Bar & Grill and Loch Fyne seafood restaurant. A rarely beautiful 1990s office block sits at No1 City Square, and the south side is taken up by the Art Deco façade of grand old dame of the Leeds Railway hotel trade, The Queens Hotel (L.N.E.R.).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Other attractions"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Thackray Medical Museum"],["url=http:\/\/www.thackraymuseum.org\/"],["email="],["address=Beckett Street"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=next door to St James' Hospital"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Award winning.

Whilst by and large these places are safe by day, it is best to avoid risking trouble.\n\nIt is also advisable to avoid displaying any memorabilia or clothing of football team Manchester United (the city's football rivals), particularly in the more sulubrious parts of town (though one can expect few problems around the city centre). Similarly, Leeds is an extremely proud city and disrespecting the area will almost certainly result in a hostile reaction to such comments. If you do encounter any trouble, the emergency services (police, ambulance, fire) number is the same as for the rest of the country: 999, or the new European wide emergency number: 112.\n\nIf you do happen to get ill in Leeds, there are of course NHS and private medical practices all across the city.
