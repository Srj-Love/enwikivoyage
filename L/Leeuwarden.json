The master builder was however unaccustomed to the clay grounds under the city, and the measures he took to ensure the towers stability (including a 1.15m foundation and a broad base) soon turned out to be insufficient. The tower was only 10 meters high when it started to lean. Attempts to correct for the sag resulted in the tower not only leaning, but also being bent in itself. After about 4 years, the construction was stopped and the tower remained as it was ever since: 40 meters high and leaning. Only in 2005 experts found that one side of the tower was built on the remains of an artificial dwelling hill, which is believed to explain many of the problems. In any case, although nothing like the Martinitower in grandeur, the Oldehove has proven an interesting landmark for the city and it has been recently restored.
