The community is adjacent to the Lahav forest on a group of hills overlooking the Negev Desert. Lehavim is home to many of Beer-Sheva's business owners as well as physicians and surgeons from the Soroka University Medical Centre. Nearly all of Lehavim's citizens commute to Beer Sheva for work.Lehavim is compromised of only deatached villas on manicured lots with palm trees and meticulous gardens. The majority of the population is upper middle class and wealthy businessmen. The community is also home to the Lehavim Country Club, a health, fitness, and relaxation facility for the citizens of the community. The local commercial plaza offers a grocery store, a barber shop, a bank, a public library and a post office. In the summer of 2007, Lehavim train station was opened, it lies on the express train line between Tel Aviv and Beer Sheva. Due to this expansion, Lehavim has experienced a large increase in real estate prices due to inability to keep up with demand. \n\nThe community is compromised of an older neighbourhood approximately 20 years of age while the rest of the area was built within the past ten years. Lehavim has long been Omer's (another satellite community on the outskirts of Beer Sheva) biggest rival in attracting quality population from the city of Beer Sheva.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=ISR-HW40.png"],["imagesize1=30"],["directionl1=N"],["majorl1= ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tel Aviv"]]}],["minorl1="],["directionr1=S"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beer Sheva"]]}],["minorr1="],["link1="]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["31.3667"],["34.8167"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Negev"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Lehavim"]]}]
