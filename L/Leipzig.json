It was founded at the crossing of two ancient trade routes, Via Regia and Via Imperii. Leipzig has always been known as a place of commerce and still has large trade fairgrounds and exhibition halls known as the Leipzig Messe and located north of the city. Before it became common to dedicate a specific area to trade fairs, they took place in the city itself. Which is why many of the historical buildings were constructed by merchants, as well as Leipzig's unique system of arcades and courtyards.\n\nOther forms of exchange soon followed the trade of goods. The University of Leipzig (Latin: Alma mater lipsiensis) was founded in 1409, which makes it the second-oldest university in Germany. University facilities are scattered throughout the city, and you cannot miss the central campus at Augustusplatz, where construction work on the new main building is almost finished (as of January 2011).\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Leipzig Fockeberg Zentrum.jpg"],["thumb"],["Leipzig skyline"]]},"\nLeipzig acquired the nickname Klein Paris (\"Little Paris\") in the 18th century, when it became a center of a classical literary movement largely lead by the German scholar and writer Johann Christoph Gottsched.\n\nThe city is also the home of the Nikolaikirche (Church of St. Nicholas) – the starting point of peaceful demonstrations against the communist regime which led to German Reunification. The collapse of communism hit Leipzig's economy very heavily (as did communism itself), but after being on the mend for over twenty years, it has emerged as one of the success stories of the \"New German States\".\n\nTraces of Leipzig's history are everywhere: the ring of streets around the city center marking the former course of the city wall, the city trade houses, abandoned and repurposed industrial buildings in Plagwitz, small town structures in the outskirts where surrounding towns were incorporated during phases of rapid growth, the battlefields of the Napoleonic wars in the south and southeast of the city, and much, much more.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Tourist Information"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Tourist Information"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.leipzig.de\/int\/en\/tourist\/"],["email=info@ltm-leipzig.de"],["address=Katharinenstraße 8"],["lat=51.34223"],["long=12.37521"],["directions=near Markt in the city center"],["phone=+49-341-71 04-260 or -265"],["tollfree="],["fax=+49(0)341\/71 04-271 or -276"],["hours="],["price="],["content=You can download some leaflets from their website ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.leipzig.de\/int\/en\/tourist\/infomaterial\/"]}],["content=You can download some leaflets from their website ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.leipzig.de\/int\/en\/tourist\/infomaterial\/"]}]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nLeipzig is a transportation hub in Saxony.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nLeipzig can easily be reached by car, as it is very well connected with the Autobahn highway system.

Car parks are available at Hauptbahnhof, Augustusplatz, Burgplatz, and several other locations. A parking guidance system is installed on the main streets. Around the inner ring, signs point you to the different car parks and display the current number of unused parking spots. Signs are color-coded, each color representing a car park location. Since the city center is pretty compact, for most purposes it won't matter much where you leave your car. When you visit the Gewandhaus or the opera, the car park underneath Augustusplatz is the most convenient option with exits to both buildings.\n\nWatch for the trams when making turns. They are stronger than your car and sometimes come from behind beside the street. At marked tram stops, if the driving lane is to the right of the track, you have to wait behind a stopping tram and let passengers get on and off.

The Old City Hall was built 1556 by Hieronymus Lotter on basements of two Patrician houses. It is a beautiful Renaissance style building, 90 meters long with arcades (1906–09), six gables and a tower. In the 18th century the tower was enlarged and it received a Baroque spire. Until 1904 the Old City Hall was home of the city administration. Then it became home of the city museum. Most impressive is the huge Banquetting Hall with Renaissance interior (open fireplaces). Many fine works of medieval religious art: altars, paintings, wood-carved sculptures etc. Most of them were saved from churches which were deconstructed in Leipzig's surrounding. Very impressive are the rooms with interior from old Patrician houses. Also interesting: the treasure chamber (steep and narrow staircase!). This Renaissance building was erected in just nine months in 1556–57 under the direction of the architect Hieronymus Lotter. The municipal government moved into the New Town Hall in 1909. If you have a bit of luck you are allowed to visit the cellar of the building. Here you find the chamber of torture and the jail. Leipzig's Renaissance City hall contains a museum of city history which possesses the original of the only confirmed painting of Bach produced in his lifetime. It contains interesting information regarding the public executions that previously took place in the market in front of the city hall. The most famous execution was that of Woyzeck later made famous by the Büchner play and the opera of Alban Berg. The interior of the Old City Hall (built in 1556) is far more interesting than the outside view.
