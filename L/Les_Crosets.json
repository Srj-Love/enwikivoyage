It is not possible to ski conveniently between the two areas, however it is possible to get from Champoussin to Les Crosets if you can tolerate a 30 minute uphill walk.  Go to the top of the Aiguille des Champeys chair lift and then follow the piste uphill to the south-west.  After 30 minutes of mainly uphill walking you will reach a blue run that goes down to Les Crosets.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Restaurant at the Hotel des Portes du Soliel"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Chez Nelly"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Sundance (Pizza)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Restaurant at the Hotel Telecabine"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Hotel des Portes du Soleil"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Hotel Telecabine"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Valais"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usablecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Les Crosets"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["46.183989"],["6.834869"]]}]
