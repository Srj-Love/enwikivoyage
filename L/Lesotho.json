The major border posts are Caledonspoort, Ficksburg Bridge, Makhaleng Bridge, Maseru Bridge, Ngoangoma Gate, Peka Bridge, Qacha's Nek, Ramatseliso's Gate, Sani Pass, Sephaphos Gate, Tele Bridge and Van Rooyen's Gate. Please note that some of the border posts can only be accessed by four-wheel driven cars, and only Maseru Bridge and Ficksburg Bridge are open 24 hours; other borders can close as early as 4PM.\n\nThe Sani Pass Road (P318) from north of Himesville to the South African Border control point 7 km from the actual border is fine for normal cars. From there, it's officially 4WD, high clearance vehicles only until the Sani Top Botswana border police post. The South Africans may not bother to tell you that after you leave their control point this \"road\" then becomes a narrow, winding and incredibly steep, rocky track that feels like you are climbing into a mist shrouded, lost world if they feel like a laugh. Once you have started the final climb you are committed, since there is no room to turn around if you find the challenge too great for you or your vehicle.\n\nThe main roads in Lesotho are similar to minor roads in Europe — they are sealed, and surprisingly free of potholes.  The A1 road (aka 'Main North') is tarred from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Maseru"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mokhotlong"]]},", and the A2 (aka 'Main South') is tarred from Maseru to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Qacha's Nek"]]},".  The roads to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Roma (Lesotho)"],["Roma"]]},", Mohale Dam and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Katse Dam"]]}," are also tarred.  For the visitor, the only unsealed roads you are likely to use are the road to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Semonkong"]]}," (4x4 only most of the year although some drive in 2x4 hire cars) and the last 20km to Malealea, which is easy in a saloon.  Note that the road running east-west to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Thaba Tseka"]]}," is now sealed and in good condition.\n\nIf setting off in to the mountains, check your car over before the trip (top up the oil, pump the spare tyre etc.). There are some steep climbs which require 2nd or even 1st gear to get up — so don't attempt to drive to Qacha's Nek with 5 people squeezed into a hired 1.3 litre CitiGolf!\n\nIf in doubt, please ask locals if the road you are going to take is okay, especially during wintertime. The truth is that if you keep to the main roads you are likely to drive on a road smoother than Eastern Free State (RSA) roads. However the  stretch from Oxbow to Mokhotlong is not tarred (regardless of some maps that claim it is) and very potholed. \n\nWhen taking a rented car, be sure to get permission from the rental company to take the car into Lesotho. You will need to show written permission from the rental company at border control. Be clear with your rental agency about what's covered and what's not in order to avoid unpleasant surprises.

Try to get the front seat by the driver for more leg room.  Prices are fixed by the government. There is a risk of overcharging foreigners — ask the other passengers if you are not sure of the price. Be warned, the reason the Minibus taxis are so cheap is because of the way they fit so many people in! Don't be surprised to see kids sitting on laps four or five high, or to be told to have large amounts of luggage on your lap or wedged in around you. The Minibus taxis tend to be poorly maintained and are not insured.\nHowever, very few accidents involving taxis occur.\n\nIntercity travel by taxi will cost no more than LSL50 for a single way ticket, and inner city minibus taxi rides will cost you around LSL2.50 (4+1s will cost you LSL20 for the whole car, no matter how many are with you, provided its within a city.)\n\nAlways check the cost of a taxi ",{"type":"'''","value":["before"]}," you get in.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Finding a taxi"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Maletsunyanefalls.JPG"],["thumb"],["upright=1.3"],["Maletsunyane Falls near the village of Semonkon"]]},"\nUpon arrival in one of the main towns, you will notice that all the minibuses are hooting their horns, which is to signal that they have space for more passengers.

The road is tarred to Mokhotlong (via Leribe) and is now tarred all the way to Qacha's Nek going south from Maseru. In the towns some side roads are unsealed but you can bump along in a saloon easily enough — If heading off in to the mountains on unsealed roads (e.g. to the Kao diamond mine) then a 4x4 is a must.
