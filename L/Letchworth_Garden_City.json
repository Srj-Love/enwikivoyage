[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Letchworth Garden City"]}," (more commonly ",{"type":"'''","value":["Letchworth"]},") is a town in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hertfordshire"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThe first Garden City, Letchworth, began life in 1903.  Built on 3,818 acres of land, this city was the brainchild of Ebenezer Howard who wrote the book titled To-Morrow: A Peaceful Path to Real Reform in 1898, which was reprinted in 1902 as Garden Cities of To-Morrow.  Unimpressed with the cities and towns of the 19th century, his belief was that town and country should and could be married together to provide the very best for inhabitants.  One hundred years on and Letchworth is a thriving town of 5,300 acres complete with tree-lined suburbs, green spaces and a town centre with ample parking, shopping and restaurants. Unfortunately the catastrophic \"retail park\" on the Baldock fringe of Letchworth's industrial area has sucked much of the life out of the town centre.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By train"]},"\n\nFrom LONDON: Use the Great Northern Route service departing London Kings Cross Station. Letchworth or Cambridge are the final stops with the travel time varying between 35 – 50 minutes according to number of scheduled stops en route.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Standalone Farm"]}," is a great place to take the kids for a day out.  A small working working show farm set in 170 acres of Hertfordshire countryside, it offers a fabulous way to introduce children to animals and farmlife.  Lambs, calves, chicks, ducks, pigs, chickens, sheep, goats, cows and horses are all there for you to meet and there is a lovely picnic area next to the children’s outdoor play area where you can enjoy lunch.  There is also an indoor play area for those more gloomy days and you will find plenty of interesting displays in the exhibition barn.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["The First Garden City Heritage Museum"]}," is as good a place as any to start your exploration of this area and to find out more about the Garden City Movement.  You can also enjoy temporary exhibitions, which cover various subjects to do with the social history of the city.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["The Broadway Cinema"]}," is a delightful Art Deco building offering 4 screens within the original 1920s construction. Particularly keen ticket prices for weekday evenings, Fridays excepted.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["The Greenway"]}," is a 13 mile plus walk\/cycle around the town. The bits to the north are properly paved and so I guess more suitable for buggies or wheel chairs.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["buy"],["name=David's Music"],["url=http:\/\/www.davids-music.co.uk"],["email="],["address=Eastcheap"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=less than 2 minutes from the train station, past the hogshead"],["phone = +44 1462475900"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=A 'proper' record shop in the traditional mould - a good range of new and second hand music (cd and vinyl - including some rare bits), great atmosphere and excellent, knowledgable staff who are passionate about what they do.
