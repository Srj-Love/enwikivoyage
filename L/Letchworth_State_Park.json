The ",{"type":"'''","value":["Genesee River"]}," has carved a magnificent gorge through this area, including a series of three large waterfalls, earning the park its nickname, ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Grand Canyon of the East"]},".  It's one of the most spectacular natural landscapes in the entire northeast.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nA popular destination for day-trips and camping alike, the vistas of Letchworth State Park have entranced since human eyes first sighted them.  Today, outdoor enthusiasts use bikes, skis, snowshoes, horses, or just their feet to traverse the trails, while sightseers gape at the three magnificent cascades of the Genesee and the abundant foliage.  It's well worth a side trip for anyone visiting nearby, or even as the main destination for travelers from afar.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nThe Seneca Indians called the area ",{"type":"''","value":["Sehgahunda"]},", meaning the \"Vale of Three Falls,\" forming several villages within what are now the park boundaries. Many of the trails in the park today are based on actual Seneca trails, which were used for river access.\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, when the Erie Railroad needed to bridge the gorge, they built the world's tallest wooden bridge right above the Upper Falls.  The view from up there was so spectacular that trains would ",{"type":"'''","value":["stop and let passengers off"]}," just to take in the sight.  On one such voyage was ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Buffalo"]]}," industrialist ",{"type":"'''","value":["William Pryor Letchworth"]},"; he so enjoyed the view that he bought over a thousand acres of gorge land and built himself a summer home.  He called the estate ",{"type":"'''","value":["Glen Iris"]}," after the rainbow that often formed in the mist of the Middle Falls.  As his death approached, the elderly Letchworth decided to protect the gorge from hydro-power development by deeding it to the State for use as a park in 1906.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\nDespite its nickname, the valley carved by the Genesee River doesn't really look like the Grand Canyon; visitors who've seen the real thing won't be very impressed by the comparison.  For starters, it's much smaller in scale.  At its widest point, the Grand Canyon is 18 miles (29 km) wide; Letchworth Park would just fit inside there—lengthwise!  And the Grand Canyon's mile-high depth dwarfs the 300-foot walls of the Letchworth gorge.  On the other hand, Letchworth has far more vegetation in and around the gorge, and it's fair to say there are few other gorges this side of the Mississippi that approach Letchworth in either size or beauty.\n\nGeologically, the Letchworth gorge is very young, carved when the Genesee was forced to find a new route northward after the last ice age.  The preglacial river that flowed through current-day ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Portageville"]]}," was a tributary of the preglacial Genesee River, and it took a more easterly course through ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nunda"]]},".  It then joined the main branch of the preglacial Genesee, which flowed northwest to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mount Morris"]]},", then north to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rochester (New York)"],["Rochester"]]},".  When the two branches of the river were blocked by glacial debris at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dansville"]]}," and Nunda, the east branch rerouted to the south, becoming part of the Susequehanna watershed, while the west branch was forced into a more direct route between Portageville and Mount Morris.\n\nThe new route led the river over the Allegheny Plateau, dropping into the preglacial river valley at Mount Morris.  Over the next ten millennia, the cascade carved its way backward, much as the Niagara River did during the same period, eventually forming a series of three waterfalls just north of modern Portageville... and a spectacular gorge in its wake.  The course the gorge takes is a bit unusual; it twists and turns rather than taking a straight path; since the river once flowed in a meandering route over a broad plain, the falls cut their way backward along the course that it initially took.\n\nThe three cascades of the upper Genesee should not be confused with three similar waterfalls farther downstream (to the north) in Rochester.  Both locations have a Lower, Middle, and Upper (or High) Falls, and both sets were formed during the same period, but they are more than fifty miles apart.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Waterfalls"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Lower Falls at Letchworth State Park, New York, USA.jpg"],["right"],["thumb"],["250px"],["The Lower Falls"]]},"\n\nThe three cascades are near the south end of the park.  The Upper Falls, which total 71 feet (a 50-foot main drop and a few rapids just below) drop over a tight horseshoe bend, making them a little hard to see, but the Portage Bridge just above the crest makes for a dramatic backdrop.  The Middle Falls are within easy walking distance of the Upper, and they are both the tallest (107 ft) and the most picturesque.  The rainbows of the Middle Falls captured the imagination of both the Seneca Indians (who believed the beauty of the falls made the sun pause at midday) and William Pryor Letchworth, who named his estate Glen Iris after the rainbow-filled valley of the Middle Falls.\n\nThe Lower Falls are a bit farther downstream, and they have the shortest drop (70 feet).  You've got to climb down a substantial set of stairs to get to any decent viewing location, but it's worth it, as the Lower Falls' face is the most interesting of the three.  There's a stone footbridge just below the Lower Falls, the only (legal) way to walk across the river within the park.\n\nWhile the three main waterfalls capture most of the attention—rightfully so—there are a number of other waterfalls in the park, each representing a tributary of the Genesee that now has to drop all the way down into the carved gorge.  That makes for some very tall falls, though they tend to be fairly small in width and volume.  Some even dry up seasonally.  But with total drops approaching 500 feet, the heights some of these falls reach can rival the volume of the Genesee Falls for sheer spectacle.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\nUnlike the Grand Canyon of the West, Letchworth's gorge walls are covered in trees, making for spectacular sightseeing in the autumn, as the leaves change color.  Birdwatchers love the rim of the gorge for spotting hawks, eagles, and vultures soaring overhead.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Map - Letchworth State Park - overview.png"],["right"],["thumb"],["400px"]]},"\nLetchworth is located on the western edge of New York's ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Finger Lakes"]]}," region.  It's about 50 miles (80 km) east-southeast of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Buffalo"]]},", and about 40 miles (65 km) south-southwest of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rochester (New York)"],["Rochester"]]},", depending on what part of the 17-mile-long park you're headed to.  For example, if you're headed from the Rochester airport to the Mount Morris Dam, at the north end of the park, it'll take about 45 minutes to drive.  If you're headed to the Portageville end, to see the waterfalls, on the other hand, you'll tack on an extra twenty minutes—or an extra 45 minutes if you drive through the park.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nThe most convenient expressway to Letchworth is I-390, which runs south from the Rochester airport and passes near Mount Morris as it travels through the preglacial Genesee Valley.  If you're going to the north end of the park, take the Mount Morris exit (Exit 7); if you're going to the south end, you can take Exit 7 and drive through or around the park, or take Exit 4 or 5 in Dansville and follow State Route 436 west to Portageville.  The major east-west expressway routes are the New York State Thruway (I-90), about 20 miles (30 km) north of Mount Morris, and I-86 (the Southern Tier Expressway), about the same distance south of Portageville; both connect up with I-390 or any number of state routes that are more direct.\n\nThe park has six entrances, but choose wisely, as there's no way to cross the river (by car, at least) once you're in the park.  All of the amenities, including the main park road, are on the west side of the river; the east side has a number of trails and a couple of campgrounds, but is largely wild and undeveloped.  On the other hand, only the west side carries an admission fee.\n\nOn the east side, the Parade Grounds entrance is to the south near Portageville, off New York State Route 436; it's closed in winter, but the rest of the year leads to the only cabins on the east side.  Its trails provide east-side views of the falls and gorge that many visitors never see.  There's also a Mount Morris Dam entrance on the north end, accessible from New York State Route 408 south of Mount Morris, which only provides access to the dam's visitors center (along with a nice gorge overlook).\n\nMost visitors will use a west-side entrance.  The main entrance is all the way at the top of the park; take New York State Route 36 West (northwest) from Mount Morris and across the river (or eastbound from Leicester, a couple miles to the north) and turn onto the Park Road.  There's also access to the Park Road from the Perry entrance and Castile entrance, each farther south.  Castile is the southernmost entrance open in the winter; the entrance at the southern tip, the Portageville entrance, is closed in winter.  The Portageville entrance is on New York State Routes 19A and 436; the former comes in from the south, through Portageville, while the latter runs east-west and connects to Nunda and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dansville"]]},".  The Portageville and Castile entrances provide the best access to the falls, the most popular gorge views, the Glen Iris Inn, and the highest concentration of lodges, cabins, and concessions.\n\nTo get from one side of the park to the other, you can cross at the north end on Route 36 or at the south end on Route 436, but either way you'll have to re-enter the park at another entrance.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By foot"]},"\n\nPart of the park's trail system is connected to the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.fogvg.org\/ Genesee Valley Greenway"]}]},", a multi-use rail trail that extends 90 miles (140 km) from the Erie Canal in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rochester (New York)"],["Rochester"]]}," all the way down to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cuba (New York)"],["Cuba"]]}," in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southern Tier"]]},", along I-86.  The trail crosses the river on Route 36 in Mount Morris, right at the north end of the park; one of the park's trails picks up just inside the park entrance.  From there, the Greenway heads southeast through Mount Morris and Sonyea, then southwest through Tuscarora, Nunda, and Oakland before entering the park north of Portageville; from there you can access the east-side facilities and trails near the Parade Grounds entrance.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nBoth Buffalo and Rochester have mid-sized airports with plenty of flights daily from all the major domestic hubs and fully staffed rental car agencies.

Alternatively, the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/nysparks.com\/admission\/empire-passport\/ Empire Passport"]}]}," costs $65 and gets you access to all New York State Parks; it's valid from the date of purchase through the end of March in the following calendar year (that is, for at least 3 and as many as 15 months, depending on date of purchase).\n\nCertain park amenities and attractions cost extra; see individual listings below.\n\nYou don't need a permit to do most things in the park; the exceptions are for hunting and nighttime snowmobiling.
