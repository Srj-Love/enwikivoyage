[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\nThe largest town in Donegal, with a population of about 18,000. With adequate road infrastructure, ",{"type":"'''","value":["Letterkenny"]}," boasts a good nightlife with plenty of third-level college students to create a lively atmosphere. It has plenty of decent pubs, and more than enough places to eat, to suit all ages. It is popular with hen and stag parties. Letterkenny is arguably the shopping capital of the North-west, though ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Derry"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Northern Ireland"]]}," is larger.\n\nIt is the ideal place to base yourself if you want to explore regions like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["the Rosses"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Glenveagh National Park"]]}," and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fanad Peninsula"]]},". It is a fast expanding town, with many housing developments being built. This has spoiled much of the scenic environment close to the town. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nPoised at the mouth of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Lough Swilly"]},", the town grew in the 17th century from a small market village to a prosperous town in Donegal and was the Ecclesiastical Seat for the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Diocese of Raphoe"]},". Situated on Lough Swilly, the town was an important shipping port in the past with goods such as coal and grain landing here (the Swilly river has silted up in recent decades, which makes it difficult to conceive that ships came as far as the \"Oldtown Bridge\"). A railway service also thrived in the town. There is evidence of these long-past activities still, with place names such as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Station Road"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Port Bridge"]},". Some monuments also commemorate Letterkenny's proud shipping and rail past.\n\nLetterkenny’s name come from the Irish ",{"type":"''","value":["Leitir Ceannain"]}," meaning Hillside of the O’Canainn clan, the earliest recorded overlords of this Swilly region. Letterkenny is now a busy working town but with all the major amenities needed to cater for tourists and visitors. \n\nThe Main Street, which was once the commercial centre of the town, has now given way to the newer shopping centres that are located on the town's boundaries. This makes the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Main Street"]}," a pleasant, quieter place to stroll about, with more traditional shops in evidence. The Upper Main Street starts at the traffic lights near the town's courthouse and runs to the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Market Square"]},", where the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Courtyard Shopping Center"]}," (mall) is located. Lower Main Street, which has fewer shops or businesses, runs downhill from the Market Square to the roundabout, known locally as the \"Dunne's Stores Roundabout\".\n\nLetterkenny was voted as Ireland's tidiest large urban area in the Tidy Towns' competition 2007.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nAlthough the O'Cannons were the last chieftains of Tir Conaill no evidence of forts or castles belonging to the clan exists in or around the Letterkenny district.\n\nRory O'Cannon, the last chieftain of the O'Cannon clan was killed in 1248. Godfrey O'Donnell succeeded Rory O'Cannon as King of Tir Conaill. He engaged Maurice Fitzgerald, the Norman Lord, in battle at Credan in North ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sligo"]]}," in 1257 in which both received serious wounds. Godfrey retired to a crannóg (a man-made island) in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gartan"]]}," Lake. O'Neill of Tyrone, taking advantage of Godfrey's fatal illness demanded submission, from the Cenel Conail since they lacked a strong chieftain. Godfrey summoned his forces and led them himself although he had to be carried on a litter (stretcher). O'Neill and his men were defeated here by the Swilly in 1258. Godfrey died after the battle as he was being carried down Letterkenny's Main Street. He was buried in Conwal Cemetery, located just outside the town on the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Glenties"]]},"\/",{"type":"[[","value":[["Churchill"]]}," road. A coffin-shaped cross slab marks his grave.\n\nThe receding of the waters of the Atlantic eastwards enabled progress - the building of bridges etc.- and the town of Letterkenny as we know it today developed. It began in the wake of the Ulster Plantation 1610-1611 when 1000 acres were granted to a Scotsman Patrick Crawford who then formed a compact community. The honour of formally launching the town is supposed to go to Sir George Marbury, who married Patrick Crawford's widow, - Crawford died suddenly while on a return visit to his native Scotland.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nGetting to Letterkenny is by means of car or bus only, as the town lacks a rail link. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Car"]},"\n\nThere are three main road arteries into Letterkenny. One is via ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Derry"]]}," if you are travelling from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Northern Ireland"]]},".

This journey takes about 4 hours. Use the M1 motorway from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dublin"]]}," Airport, leave the motorway at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ardee"]]}," exit to join the N2 and travel via Monaghan towards Derry, crossing the border into ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Northern Ireland"]]}," at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Aughnacloy"]]},". Turn off at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Strabane"]]}," for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lifford"]]}," and then onto \"Letterkenny\".
