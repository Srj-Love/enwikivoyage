It's a true university town in which the town is more alive during the academic year (end of September till June), although there are a lot of events in Summer. The university, with about 35,000 students every year, is the oldest Catholic University in the world, founded in 1425.

In general however, Leuven has everything to appeal to both young and old: A lively nightlife, interesting and sometimes stunning historic sites, the important and world renowned University and two seemingly endless shopping streets.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Begijnhofleuven2005sep2.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Groot Begijnhof, UNESCO."]]},"\nThe city has a long and interesting history, being founded probably in the 9th century.

Most of the city was thrashed and burned to the ground by the German invasion in World War I, and was again damaged during World War II. The historic centre itself however has been preserved and historic buildings like the University Library have been restored, partly with foreign relief funds.\n\nLeuven is located just east of Brussels (20 km). It is the capital of the Province of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Flemish Brabant"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Belgium"]]},". This means it houses a lot of administrative services and the Province Building, where the province council is located. Its main industries are technology (due to the University) and beer. Important companies have their home base in Leuven, such as InBev and Imec\n\nLeuven contains two UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the ",{"type":"''","value":["Groot Begijnhof"]}," (Grand Beguinage) is part of the Flemish Beguinages.

The streets are safe, even at night, although you better avoid public gardens at night. Even though most of them have closing hours which vary throughout the seasons.\nOf course, it is advised to take the precautions tourists are urged to take everywhere (e.g. to avoid pickpocketing). If you have a bike, make sure it is secured with a decent lock as students tend to 'borrow' bicycles. Similarly, jackets left unattended in bars may be at risk.\n\nThe city centre police station is located next to City Hall at Grote Markt. Don't hesitate to walk in if you have questions.\nPolice usually patrol by car and on foot, and most of the times anonymously instead of walking around in uniform (especially at night).\nTry to avoid the area around Sint-Maartensdal and De Bruul (located in between Brouwersstraat and Pereboomstraat). There are also some spots in the suburb Kessel-Lo which are better avoided at night.(Casablanca and Vredespleintje)\n\nBeware that police are especially harsh on traffic violations (also the ones made on a bike!), violent behavior and public disturbance.\n\nNote that Belgium and the Netherlands have different drug regulations! Smoking pot (marihuana) is officially not allowed, although it is tolerated when done indoors. An adult can never have more than needed for 'personal use'. Expect any more to be confiscated if they are found by police and you risk being penalized.\n\nUseful phone numbers:\n",{"type":"*","value":["Police: 101"]},{"type":"*","value":["Emergencies: 112 (can be used from mobile phones)."]},{"type":"*","value":["Local police: 016210611   (+3216210611 from abroad)."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:University Hospitals Leuven Gasthuisberg.jpg"],["thumb"],["350px"],["UZ Leuven, late 2008."]]},"\n\nLeuven has two larger hospitals. \nThe Academic Hospital UZ Leuven ",{"type":"''","value":["Gasthuisberg"]}," ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.uzleuven.be\/en "]}," is the largest hospital in Belgium and is located just along the ring road. \nThe Regional Hospital ",{"type":"''","value":["Heilig Hart"]}," ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.hhleuven.be\/ "]}," is located in the city centre. As always, dial 112 when you are in distress. You will be taken to either of both hospitals.\n\nFor smaller health problems, Belgians usually go to their family doctor, who are often in a group practice in city areas. Ask your hotel, hostel or guide for information on the nearest doctor. Going to the Emergency Room for small health problems will not only cost you, it will also take longer to get help (~45 minutes).\n\nLeuven literally has a pharmacy at every corner.
