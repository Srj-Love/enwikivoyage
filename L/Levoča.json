The town has a historic centre with a well preserved town wall, a Renaissance church with the tallest wooden altar in the world, carved by Master Paul of Levoča, and many other Renaissance buildings. The town is known in German as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Leutschau"]}," and in Hungarian as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Löcse"]},".\n\nOn 28 June 2009, Levoča was added by UNESCO to its ",{"type":"[[","value":[["World Heritage List"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nLevoča is located in the historical region of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Spiš"]]}," (formerly Szepes County), which was inhabited as early as the Stone Age. In the 11th century, this region was conquered and, subsequently, became part of the Kingdom of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hungary"]]}," and remained such until 1918. After the Mongol invasions of 1241\/1242, the area was also settled by Germans. The town became the capital of the Association of Spiš Germans, with a form of self-rule within the Kingdom of Hungary. The oldest written reference to the city of Levoča dates back to 1249. In 1317, Levoča (at that time generally known by the German name of Leutschau) received the status of a royal town. In 1321 wide-ranging concessions were granted enticing  merchants, craftsmen and mine-developers to settle in the town.\n\nIn the 15th century Levoča, located on an intersection of trade routes between Poland and Hungary, became a rich centre of commerce. It exported iron, copper, furs, leather, corn, and wine. At the same time the town became an important cultural centre. The English humanist Leonard Cox taught around 1520 in a school in Levoča. The bookseller Brewer from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wittenberg"]]}," transformed his bookstore in a prolific printing plant, that lasted for 150 years. Finally, one of the best-known medieval woodcarvers, Master Paul of Levoča, settled here. In this period of prosperity several churches were built and the town had a school, library, pharmacy, and physicians. Levoča was a center of the Protestant Reformation in Northern Hungary.\n\nThe town kept this cultural and economic status until the end of 16th century, in spite of two damaging fires: the first in 1550 and another in 1599.  The town started to decline during the anti-Habsburg uprisings in the 17th century. In a lurid sequence of events in 1700, the mayor of the town was accidentally wounded by a local nobleman during a hunt, generating a series of revenge attacks, finally resulting in the murder of the mayor, Karol Kramler. The mayor's arm was then cut off, embalmed, and preserved in the town hall as a call to further revenge. This became the subject of a novel about the town, ",{"type":"''","value":["The Black City"]},", by the writer Kálmán Mikszáth.\n\nThe economic importance of the town was further diminished in 1871 when the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Košice"]]},"–",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bohumín"]]}," Railway was built just 8 km to the south, bypassing Levoča and going through the nearby town of Igló, (today known by its Slovak name, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Spišská Nová Ves"]]},").  Later, in 1892, a spur line was built from Spišská Nová Ves railway station to Levoča. After the Treaty of Trianon and the dismantling of the Kingdom of Hungary, the city became part of the newly formed Czechoslovakia and its traditional Slovak name of Levoča was formally adopted. Later, during World War II, under the auspices of the First Slovak Republic, 981 local Jews were deported from the town to extermination camps.\n\nOn July 3, 1995 Levoča was visited by Pope John Paul II. He celebrated a mass for 650,000 celebrants at the traditional pilgrim site of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mariánska hora"]},", a hill about 2 km north of Levoča with a spectacular view of the town.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Levoča today"]},"\nLevoča remains a quiet, almost sleepy, town - unless there is a major event taking place, they roll the pavements up at about 20.30. The populations who created an intellectual centre over the past centuries - Hungarians, Germans and Jews - have largely vanished as a result of the political  turmoil of the 20th century, and the town's inhabitants are now mostly Slovak, but with a substantial minority of Roma (gypsies). Despite Levoča's UNESCO World Heritage status, little has been done to capitalise on the town's enormous tourist potential, and whilst this is in one sense attractive to visitors, it doesn't much help the town's economy. Nevertheless, an interesting sign is the increasing number of foreigners who have bought and restored some of the historic buildings in the main square and its surrounding streets - these include Britons, Belgians, Israelis, Ukrainians and at least one New Zealander - so the town is gradually developing its reputation and a cosmopolitan population.\n\nAs a former 'royal city' Levoča is a member of the  ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.pentapolitana.sk\/pentapolitana-en\/ 'Pentapolitana' association"]}," which links it with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Košice"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bardejov"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Prešov"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sabinov"]]}," in developing education, culture and tourism.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Geography"]},"\nLevoča lies at an altitude of 570 metres (1,870 ft) above sea level and covers an area of 64.042 square kilometres (24.7 sq mi).
