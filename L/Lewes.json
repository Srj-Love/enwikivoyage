Practical information can be found at the Lewes Bonfire Council website ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.lewesbonfirecouncil.org.uk\/"]},". An extensive history of the celebrations can be found at any of the society webpages, including that of the well-known Cliffe Bonfire society. ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cliffebonfire.com\/history.html"]},".\n\nDespite the vigour with which the town mounts it's bonfire, visitors from outside the local vicinity of Lewes are often actively and strongly discouraged from coming to town on Bonfire by locals, as a number of misunderstandings, trouble and bad press are perceived to stem from outsiders who do not understand the tradition and organization of the night, mistaking it often as a chance to get drunk in public and act inappropriately. Anti-social behavior by visitors has also in previous\nyears lead to a firm response from those policing and marshalling the events.\n\nClaimed as being amongst largest celebrations in the UK, Bonfire is a true spectacle to behold - with several bonfire sites throughout town (each home to an individual society) which host a bonfire, the burning of effegies (often cuttingly pollitical in the case of the Cliffe Society) and of course, fireworks. A number of societies parade through the town in costume in grand processions displaying banners and effigies. The costumes ranging from the historical, luxurious to the down-right bizarre.\nThese processions are torch-lit with more hand held paraffin torches than you are likely to ever see anywhere else. The entire night is one large party, but one that locals take very seriously. An incredible amount of time, cost and energy goes into the organization of the night each year, and traditions such as the death march are observed with the same pride as they would have been four hundred years ago.\n\nFor safety reasons, all roads in and out of town are closed off in the late afternoon on the fifth and do not re-open until after the celebrations are over (which can be well into the small hours of Nov 6). In addition a number of side streets are also closed along with certain car parks, so that emergency response staff have clear access routes to and from incidents. Bonfire is not suitable for young children.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nLewes is proud of being one of the least \"modernised\" towns in England.

The Lewes Pound is only valid in Lewes, nowhere else in the UK.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nLewes boasts a range of international cuisine including Indian, Thai, Chinese, Italian, Polish, and good old traditional English pub-grub. For a more upmarket twist on the traditional pub food menu, one can sample the new menu at The Snowdrop Inn at the bottome of town, or give the legendary \"Elly Burger\" a go at the Elephant and Castle pub just off of the high street. For an intimate and strictly Italian experience, try Famiglia Lazzati near the War Memorial on the high street, or for an oriental flavour give the wonderful Thai restaurant, the Pailin on Station Street a go. Late night revellers can try to stave off (or encourage depending on your point of view!) a hangover with chips in pitta from either the Charcoal Grill or Effies kebab houses, both found on the high street, and try again in the morning with a \"greasy spoon\" full English from either The Cafe (formerly Eddie's cafe) by the Prison, or the Casbah in the bottle neck.

There are, as with all places, the exceptions, but Lewes is an extremely safe place to be at any time of day or night, and the locals are friendly and accommodating. With pubs closing nationally, Lewes is no exception, and as pubs close, they are reopened by new owners, bringing with them a different atmosphere and attracting different clientele. The Lewes Arms, Dorset, Snowdrop, Black Horse, Brewers and Gardeners are all currently more quiet pubs, in volume rather than customer traffic- in fact the Lewes Arms is often bustling with people, where as the Elephant and Castle (known locally as the Elly), Lansdown, Lincolns and the Lamb are often regarded as the more busy and loud pubs... but again this is constantly changing. The only pub in Lewes that seems to stay the same is the infamous Tally Ho pub situated on the outskirts of the main town at the edge of the Landport housing estate. Frequented almost exclusively by Lanport residence, it is the only pub to maintain a constant \"bad\" reputation.
