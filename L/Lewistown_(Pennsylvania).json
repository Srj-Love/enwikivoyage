Most of the shopping and restaurants are in the same general area (all within a few miles) so it is not extremely difficult to walk from place to place. There are various restaurants and shops at other places surrounding the downtown area, but shouldn't be considered to be within walking distance.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThe main land mark in Lewistown is the square downtown. There are cannons and statues that are in memory of veterans.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nThere are limited things to do in Lewistown, unfortunately. Bowling, roller skating, going out to eat, shopping, and just relaxing in parks or other areas are the main things to do. There isn't much that stays open after 10pm, even on the weekends, so most of the fun has to happens before then.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nThere are a lot of little restaurants in and around the Lewistown area. The two most popular are Downtown OIP and Grille and JP Edwards. The same man, John Pannizzo, owns them. There is a diner, Red's Diner, in Lewistown that has been around for a very long time. It used to be 24\/7 but now it closes at 10pm except on the weekends. There are numerous OIP's around the area, all with some similarities, since they started out as a family owned chain. There are also numerous Chinese restaurants throughout town, all very delicious. Of course there is the typical fast food restaurants, such as McDonald's, Wedndy's, Burger King, Subway, etc.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nThere are a few hotels in Lewistown and in the surrounding area. The most popular is what used to be the Clarion Inn, now a Quality Inn. It is technically in Burnham, as well as JP Edwards. There are also other hotels like Super 8 and Best Western.
