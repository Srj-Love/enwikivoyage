In some workshops you will find a few carpets on looms for display purposes, but the carpets in the showroom will mostly have been shipped in from elsewhere. To find authentic Tibetan carpets, visit the factories and their showrooms. Look closely at what is being woven, and make sure the piece you are buying matches what you are shown on the looms. Check the smell of the carpet: authentic Tibetan wool has a high lanolin content and a distinctive odor. Cheaper wools from Qinghai and Mongolia are dry by comparison. A few older carpets can still occasionally be found on the Barkhor and the shops around, though good, old carpets are much sought after by collectors, so prices tend to be surprisingly high, even in Lhasa.\n\nTianhai Night Market, in the western suburbs, is known for its great variety of goods and for being cheaper than the market on Barkhor Street.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["buy"],["name=Snow Leopard Industries"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address=#2 East Zang Yi Yuan Road"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=next to the Snowland Hotel and near Barkhor Square"],["phone=0891-6321481"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Small shop with a wide variety of traditional and contemporary Tibetan designs made at their own factory.
