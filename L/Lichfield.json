[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:LichCathedral5.jpg"],["thumbnail"],["Lichfield Cathedral"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Lichfield"]}," is a city and civil parish in Staffordshire, England. One of seven civil parishes with city status in England, Lichfield has a population of 31,000 & is situated 16 miles north of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Birmingham (England)"],["Birmingham"]]}," and 124 miles northwest of London.\n\nLichfield is notable for its three-spired cathedral and as the birthplace of Dr. Johnson, the writer of the first authoritative Dictionary of the English Language. A Dictionary of the English Language, one of the most influential dictionaries in the history of the English language, was prepared by Samuel Johnson and published on April 15, 1755. Lichfield is also the birthplace of Elias Ashmole (23 May 1617 â€“ 18 May 1692). Elias was a celebrated English antiquary, politician, officer of arms, astrologer and student of alchemy. He supported the royalist side during the English Civil War, and at the restoration of Charles II he was rewarded with several lucrative offices. Throughout his life he was an avid collector of curiosities and other artifacts. Many of these he acquired from the traveller, botanist, and collector John Tradescant the Younger. Ashmole donated most of his collection, his antiquarian library and priceless manuscripts to the University of Oxford to create the Ashmolean Museum.\nToday Lichfield still retains its old importance as an ecclesiastical centre, but its industrial and commercial development has been relatively small; the centre of the city thus retains an essentially old-world character, with pockets of historic charm.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By road"]},"\nLichfield is well placed for the main road network being close to the A38, A5 and M6 (Toll) so is easy to get to by car. Parking can be more of an issue as the number of spaces is often not sufficient to cope with demand, especially on Saturdays. However, the city does not usually get busy until mid morning on Saturdays and before Christmas, so early birds do well.\nMain car parks are as follows:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Multi-storey car park situated near Lichfield City Station - warning tight spaces;"]},{"type":"*","value":[" The Friary - Large car park, but a little further from the centre;"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Cross Keys - Recently built two storey car park;"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Off Beacon Street - Large car park at rear of shops, but tends to fill up first"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By rail"]},"\nLichfield has two stations.
