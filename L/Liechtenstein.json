It is the last remnant of the Holy Roman Empire and is an independent state with very close ties to Switzerland.

Until the end of World War I, it was closely tied to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Austria"]]},", but the economic devastation caused by that conflict forced ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Liechtenstein"]]}," to conclude a customs and monetary union with Switzerland. Since World War II (in which Liechtenstein remained neutral), the country's low taxes have spurred outstanding economic growth.\n\nShortcomings in banking regulatory oversight have resulted in concerns about the use of the financial institutions for money laundering and tax evasion. However, the days of bringing suitcases of money into banks for deposit without questions asked is over. Liechtensteiners are also very proud of the fact that their nation has never been physically involved in a battle or military confrontation with an \"enemy state\" and see their flag as a banner of peace.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Economy"]},"\nDespite its small size and limited natural resources, Liechtenstein has developed into a prosperous, highly industrialized, free-enterprise economy with a vital financial service sector and living standards on a par with the urban areas of its large European neighbours. The Liechtenstein economy is widely diversified with a large number of small businesses. Low business taxes--the maximum tax rate is 20%--and easy incorporation rules have induced a large number of holding or so-called letter box companies to establish nominal offices in Liechtenstein, providing 30% of state revenues.\n\nLiechtenstein participates in a customs union with Switzerland and uses Swiss francs as its national currency interchangeably with the Liechtenstein frank. It imports more than 90% of its energy requirements. Liechtenstein has been, since May 1995, a member of the European Economic Area, an organization serving as a bridge between the EFTA and the EU. The government is working to harmonize its economic policies with those of an integrated Europe. Liechtenstein has one of the highest personal income rates (GDP Per Capita) in the world, with the base rate of income tax currently standing at just 1.2%.\n\nLiechtenstein was the home of the Curta calculator.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Geography"]},"\nLiechtenstein is very mountainous and one of the world's two doubly-landlocked countries (along with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Uzbekistan"]]},").  Most of the country's population lives in the long and wide Rhine Valley in the western third.  Roads are mainly laid out in a north-south pattern following the valley as well. To the north the main roads lead to the border with Austria, to the south they enter Switzerland, and to the west across the river the bridges also cross into Switzerland. Most of the eastern border with Austria is not passable and is only accessible by foot as it is very mountainous, though the north of the country is well connected by road to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Feldkirch"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Austria"]]},".

Since 1923 there have been no border formalities needed for crossing between the two countries. In essence there is nothing more than a sign announcing your arrival in Switzerland or Liechtenstein (when you cross the Rhine or the land border), similar to the situation at smaller border crossings in many EU nations, (Austria\/Germany\/France\/Italy etc.) Stamp hunters can, however, get an authentic Liechtenstein entry stamp in their passport at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vaduz"]]},"'s tourist office for CHF3 or €2.00.

A fare to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vaduz"]]}," is CHF5.80 from Sargens and CHF3.40 from Buchs. Consider getting a whole network day pass (CHF12) or week pass (CHF24) if you are making many journeys, though two single fares (e.g. from Sargens or Buchs to Vaduz and Vaduz onward to Feldkirch) cost less than a day pass.\n\nFrom ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Feldkirch"]]}," railway station in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Austria"]]},", look for the distinctive off-yellow Liechtenstein Buses. Numbers 11 and 14 head straight to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vaduz"]]}," and number 13 goes to Buchs railway station, by-passing Vaduz, so you'll have to change at the Schaan interchange.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nThe Swiss Autobahn A13\/E34 runs along the Swiss side of the Rhine River, the border between Switzerland and Liechtenstein.  There are several access points that cross the Rhine into Liechtenstein, the two that are most commonly used are the bridge crossing into the southern town of Balzers and the crossing into Vaduz. Parking in Vaduz is easy, with a large parking garage located below the Kunstmuseum. Driving in Liechtenstein is relatively safe, but extra care should be taken on narrow and winding mountain roads. Speed traps are everywhere!\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Hitch-Hiking"]},"\nVery easy indeed from Feldkirch in Austria. Rush hour sees lots of commuters head into the capital. A simple sign as you stand by the main road in Feldkirch should get you a lift within minutes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nPublic transport in Liechtenstein is amazingly efficient and commonly used.  The country's sole bus operator is ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.lba.li\/ LBA"]},". LBA fares are reasonable, a 7-day unlimited use card costs CHF24. Another cheap way to travel, weather permitting, is by bike. The roads in Liechtenstein are in excellent condition and many (in the Balzers-Schaan corridor) even offer bike lanes. Biking through the whole country (entering from Austria going all the way south through to Switzerland) takes only a few hours, but is worth every minute of the wonderful alpine scenery!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nThe national language is German, but the main language in everyday use is an Alemannic German dialect, which Liechtenstein shares with German-speaking Eastern Switzerland, Baden-Württemberg (south of Stuttgart, Germany), and Vorarlberg, Austria.

It is not open to the public, but it is possible to view it from quite close up.\n\nIt is entirely possible to encounter the royal family at the Kunstmuseum, coming in and out of Schloss Vaduz or skiing during winter time.  This is one benefit of such a small country. They are recognizable in their cars, which use their birth year for their licence plate number.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nLiechtenstein offers great ",{"type":"[[","value":[["hiking"]]},", road ",{"type":"[[","value":[["biking"]]},", and mountain biking terrain.

From here you have an incredible view over Vaduz & Switzerland that you can stand and admire.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nLiechtenstein uses the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Liechtenstein frank"]}," at par with, and freely interchangeable with the Swiss franc (",{"type":"'''","value":["CHF"]},") as its currency.

There is also a McDonald's restaurant (opened in 1996; serves wine), which is very popular and is widely publicised by road signs throughout the country.\n\nThe many small bakeries are a great place to get a warm, fresh roll or pastry.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\nInternet access is available with one station at Telecom Liechtenstein immediate south of Vaduz's downtown on the main road, but this is only open during business hours.  Most hotels and some bars\/restaurants will have net access such as in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Schaan"]]},".  The last real Internet café disappeared, because every one in the country has net access in their homes, so the local market completely disappeared and only visitors need access.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nThere is a small amount of wine that is produced in Liechtenstein that is available in supermarkets and tourist shops throughout the country.  Expect to pay around CHF25 for an average bottle. The Prince even owns his own vineyard in Vaduz, off the main road. Beer is also available for purchase that is made with malt from Liechtenstein, although most of the beer itself is brewed in Switzerland.  A variety of other European wines, beers, and soft drinks are also available. There is now a brewery in Liechtenstein that produces a variety of beers; lagers including Helles (blonde) and Hefe Weizen (unfiltered wheat) styles are brewed.\n\nThere is also a one-man distillery in Triesen who makes liquors and schnapps from fruits.

You will probably be able to find cheaper accommodation in neighboring ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Feldkirch"]]},", Austria.\n\nCamping Mittagspitz is the only full-service campsite in the Principality.

The most common crime in Liechtenstein is of a non-violent nature, though the Principality maintains a well-equipped police force which maintains a presence on the streets. In the late 1990s, the ",{"type":"''","value":["Liechtenstein Landespolizei"]}," launched a crackdown on prostitution in Vaduz. Considering the largest cities nearby are Innsbruck and Zürich, outside of Schaan and Vaduz, the whole place can seem very rural. Drunk drivers and winter road conditions may be your only \"realistic\" concern. Speed limits are strictly enforced by speed cameras which will be very pricey. Don't speed, enjoy the scenery instead!\n\nThe country's beautiful scenery is also very dangerous. Cases of hikers finding themselves in difficulty are very common, and extreme care should be taken when leaving the well-marked trails. Follow local advice, read local weather forecasts (newspapers in the Principality print individual forecasts for the different cities in Liechtenstein, which is beneficial because the difference in altitude often cause different weather conditions), and ensure that you have the correct equipment before setting out.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\nThere are excellent medical facilities in Liechtenstein, but it is more likely that you would be transferred to a hospital in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Switzerland"]]}," should you require medical attention.
