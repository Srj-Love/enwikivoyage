It was once the capital of a small kingdom and is a busy tourist town today.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Lijiang-canales-l02.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["A canal in the old town"]]},"\nLijiang is the main center of the Naxi or Nakhi people, though it is by no means a Naxi-only town: at least half a dozen other ethnic groups are represented. The Naxi number under a million and are perhaps best-known for their embroidery; they also have their own language with its own hieroglyphic-style writing system, and their own religion, clothing, art, architecture, music and dance. The Chinese government classifies the Mosuo (found mainly further north around ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lugu Lake"]]},") as part of the Naxi group, but neither the Naxi nor the Mosuo accept this.\n\nLijiang or nearby Baisha (now a village 12km north of town) have been important since approximately the time of Christ, when the Naxi settled in the area, and Baisha was the capital of a Naxi kingdom from 658 to 1107. Then the area came under Chinese control and Lijiang became the administrative center. Parts of the old town date back to this period, built during the Song Dynasty (960-1279). The town was built where the Jade River divides into three and its streams form the canals and waterways which flow along the old town streets.\n\nIn 1278, the Yuan Dynasty appointed the Naxi chief Mu De hereditary ruler of the area, and the Mu family retained power for about 500 years. Today their palace is one of the major tourist attractions of the old town. \n\nLijiang became known in the west through two men who lived in or near the town in the early 20th century, Austrian-American botanist Joseph Rock who wrote a Naxi dictionary, several scholarly papers, and many articles for National Geographic, and Russian Peter Goullart who wrote several books. It has been suggested that Rock's articles inspired James Hilton's ",{"type":"''","value":["Lost Horizons"]}," novel about a fictional Himalayan paradise, Shangrila, but the claim is controversial. \n\nAfter China started to admit foreign tourists in the 1980s, Lijiang began to attract many visitors. To fulfill their needs, local people started restaurants and cafes. Chinese people also long for the lifestyle and the excellent environment in Lijiang and started to pour in.\n\nAn earthquake in 1996 flattened large parts of the town, though quite a few of the traditional wooden buildings remained standing while far more of the Mao-era brick or concrete structures collapsed. Since then there has been extensive rebuilding, mainly in traditional styles. There have been some complaints that much of that work followed traditions of central China, rather than locally appropriate ones, but most visitors will just notice a lot of rather pretty old-looking buildings.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nThere are many flights from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kunming"]]}," to Lijiang, from early morning to late at night, at around US$100 one way + ¥100 tax; the duration is only 50 minutes.  There are also direct flights from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chengdu"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chongqing"]]},", of longer duration and at higher cost. However, the train service between Lijiang and Kunming is the cheapest and most environmentally-friendly way to arrive at or depart from Lijiang.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Lijiang Airport.JPG"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Lijiang Airport"]]},"\nIt is also possible to book a flight to Lijiang from any major city in China, but most flights will stop in Kunming and many will require a change of planes there.\n\nThere are some international flights.

The return flight makes a quick refuelling stop at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chiang Rai"]]},", Thailand.\n\nThe modestly sized airport is 40 minutes from the city. You can take a taxi for ¥100 (official fixed price) to get to the city. There are touts that will offer the same trip for ¥60-80, but it is likely you will find yourself squeezed into the same vehicle with strangers. Alternatively, outside the arrival hall, you will find the airport bus, which leaves regularly when full, for ¥15, to the Blue Skies Hotel near the Guangfang Hotel, which is 1km from the old town. A taxi to the old town will be ¥7-10 from the Blue Skies Hotel carpark.\n\nWhen leaving Lijiang, arriving at the airport an hour before your flight is sufficient.\n\nLijiang is at 2400m (almost 8,000 feet) so there is some risk of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["altitude sickness"]]}," if you fly in from a lower altitude. The risk is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Altitude_sickness#How_high_is_high.3F"],["not remarkably severe"]]},", but it may be more prudent to fly to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kunming"]]}," at 2000m, acclimatise there, then come to Lijiang. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dali"]]}," would be an interesting intermediate stop. If you do fly direct to Lijiang from sea level, plan to take it easy the first day or two while your body gets acclimatised.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nThere are daily services to Dali and Kunming. A ticket booking office is located on the north side of the road several hundred metres west of the bus station. The train station is an impressive structure about 7km south of Lijiang old town. Several public bus lines serve the station, including the number 18 and some number 4 buses. Taxis are reluctant to use the meter and will demand high fares of ¥30-40, though with bargaining ¥15 may be possible. Be aware that taxis are not easy to come by in Lijiang. An alternative is the small SUV-type vans which cruise around offering a share-taxi service.\n\nA hard sleeper berth from Kunming to Lijiang costs ¥130 and runs from 10PM to 7AM. The soft sleeper car would cost you about ¥205 on the same train. If you travel by a small family, parents and a kid, consider the VIP chamber which is at the price of ¥614, one less than purchasing three individual tickets in a four bed standard room. You may feel a bit tight for luggage storage space, but you gain more valuable privacy, with your own family. From Dali the train is a faster, cheaper alternative to the crowded buses: Hard (padded) seat is about 31Y, and the journey takes only 2 hours from Dali city.\n\nTrain No. \/\/  Dpt    \/\/    Arr.   \/\/     Duration  \/\/    Dpt.

It is easy to trip on the cobblestones or fall into the canals from the walkways or bridges, many of which do not have handrails. The cobblestones can be very slippery when wet.\n\nTo see the sights outside the old town, the options are walking, biking, public bus, private mini-bus, or taxi. The public bus mainly stays within the city and stops 8PM-PM. The mini-buses are the same price as the public bus within the city. They will have the number of the bus on the front windshield. The price of a mini-bus to a nearby village is ¥2-5, but the starting location within the city is different for most villages. If you do not know where you want to go and are limited on time, the best option is to rent a taxi or mini-bus for the day, but the price can vary wildly from about ¥100 all the way up to ¥300.

It is the original settlement of the Naxi people who came to the greater Lijiang Valley over a thousand years ago. Made up of at least 12 smaller villages, the main village is Sanyuan (三元村), which has one main stone street called of course, Baisha Street. It has a typical Chinese \"old-town\" tourist setup, consisting of a stone paved street with a mixture of Chinese trinket sellers-shops and several quaint cafés to stop at relax, have a drink some Yunnan coffee eat a Naxi Pie and avoid the crowded Lijiang. A great escape from Lijiang Old-town tourist trap, only 12 km north of town, you can rent a bike and get there in about 40 minutes. You should consider staying a few nights, in a Naxi family’s courtyard, no \"hotel-Hostels\" here. Even though almost everything costs you a ticket price to do in China these days you can do many things here for free! Like hike the local mountains through the high alpine botanical garden and search for herbs on your way to the Jade Dragon Lake, the backside of Snow Jade Dragon Mountain. Visit some of the temples or traditional Naxi houses of the area before they are gone."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["Local Hospitality"],["In Biasha village, there is an old woman named Liu who will sometimes stop tourists and invite them into her home.
