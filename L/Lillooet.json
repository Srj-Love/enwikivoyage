It was the first native town in the British Columbia Interior, and was briefly the largest town of the Fraser River Gold Rush in 1858-1860.  Described by colonial Governor James Douglas as \"the prettiest spot for a town on the Fraser I have seen\", local scenery was compared by early travellers to that of the Himalayas due to the extreme heights and sheer precipices around Lillooet and in surrounding canyon country.  In a pronounced desert-like rainshadow, the town's setting is framed by spectacular cliff walls and towering mountains.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nLillooet is very hot in summer, often sunny when areas toward the Coast are rainy or areas farther east into the Interior are overcast.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nLillooet is on ",{"type":"'''","value":["Highway 99"]}," and is conveniently situated only 225 km (140 miles) from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vancouver"]]},", 130 km (80 miles) from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Whistler"]]},", and 270 km (168 miles) from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Williams Lake"]]},".
