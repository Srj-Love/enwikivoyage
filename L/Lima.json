Lima was the seat of the Spanish rule during 300 years, and as such it has wonderful churches, cloisters and monasteries that are worth a visit.\n\nLima is also the best place to try the wonderful Peruvian cuisine, which has a huge variety of ingredients from coast, mountain and Amazon regions. The cold sea current in front of Peru's large coast makes the sea very rich in fish and seafood, which have a great taste due to the special plankton they eat. Fish and seafood restaurants are therefore worth the time, and not expensive.\n\nLima is built upon a valley surrounded by an extremely arid desert. In the summer, the weather is usually beautiful, very warm and sunny, sometimes with rains around January. In the winter, the city is overcast and rainy for days at a time. The rain in the wintertime doesn't fall hard, but it gets everything wet. Temperature also falls to around 7-12 C⁰ (45-55⁰ F), which seems chillier when combined with the general dampness.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Districts"]},"\n\nThe following pages include the province of Callao and the province of Lima and their districts\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Regionlist"],["regionmap=Lima Wikivoyage map PNG.png"],["regionmaptext=Districts of Lima"],["regionmapsize=500px"],["region1name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lima\/Barranco"],["Barranco"]]}],["region1color=#AC5C91"],["region1items="],["region1description=A bohemian beach-side neighborhood known for its nightlife."],["region2name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lima\/Central"],["Central Lima"]]}],["region2color=#D5DC76"],["region2items="],["region2description=Includes the Centro Historico, Plaza Mayor (Plaza de Armas) and Plaza San Martin, churches, colonial architecture, the presidential palace, congress, and shopping streets."],["region3name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lima\/Javier Prado East"],["Javier Prado East"]]}],["region3color=#D56D76"],["region3items="],["region3description=The southeast, Jockey Plaza, Chaclacayo, Chosica."],["region4name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lima\/Javier Prado West"],["Javier Prado West"]]}],["region4color=#D09440"],["region4items="],["region4description=The southwest, Brena, the historic Pueblo Libre, San Isidro, the business district and the port area Callao"],["region5name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lima\/Miraflores"],["Miraflores"]]}],["region5color=#4F93C0"],["region5items="],["region5description=An upscale touristy neighborhood with restaurants, nightlife, and hotels.

Changing money in Miraflores can be done safely with cambistas on the street, but you must follow a few simple rules to avoid being cheated.

It is worth it to compare with several cambistas, especially if you are changing a significant amount of money.  Some of them do tricks with their calculators in your face and you won't notice, so the best way to know how much you should be getting is to bring a calculator yourself or use the one in your cellphone. Finally, make sure that the bills the cambista gives you have his or her seal (\"sello\") stamped on them - that way, if by chance one of them turns out to be counterfeit you can come back and complain.

Also, you shouldn't miss Peruvian-style hamburgers at Bembos, traditional Peruvian sandwiches in Pasquale and fusion pizza over at D'nnos Pizza if you want to give your everyday fast-food a local twist.\n\nLima is home to around 220,000 restaurants, cafes, juice bars and runs a program (Restaurante Saludable) to recognise clean and healthy restaurants.

Leave your fancy watch at home, don't wear a fine suit and don't carry a laptop when hailing taxis on the street, and keep a relaxed, friendly, smiling attitude.  If you do need to go out dressed like a gringo, call a taxi rather than hire one in the moment - the few moments you wait and the few extra soles you pay will be worth it.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Thieves"]},"\nWhile there is not much violent crime against tourists, opportunistic theft is rampant. Watch out for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["pickpockets"]]}," constantly. If you carry a purse, a camera, a backpack or just a pair of sunglasses hang on to them at all times. In crowded areas, put your back pack on your front and hold shopping close to you. Just keep your eyes open and be aware of people around you. In any case, if someone extremely friendly approaches (even wanting to stretch your hand), just try not to talk that much, and they'll go away. It's normal to find polite people around trying to help tourists, but stay away from the extremely friendly ones.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Football violence"]},"\nAvoid the surroundings of Soccer \/ Football stadiums before and after big matches, since \"barras bravas\" (hooligans) can be very violent. Ask for advice if you plan to go there or thereabouts.  Very infrequently, but occasionally, even in nicer tourist areas, gangs of youths, sometimes supporting rival football clubs, or strikers involved in a labor dispute may brawl.  If you find yourself caught in the middle of such a confrontation, just try to move out of the way, preferably behind a closed door - these youths generally do not carry lethal weapons, and the worst that is likely to happen is that someone will get hit with a rock before the police arrive to break it up.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Districts of note"]},"\nSome areas of Lima are safer than others: ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Miraflores"]]}," and San Isidro have large populations of well-to-do and wealthy Peruvians, not to mention large tourist groups, so they have a large police presence to protect the population. Other districts, such as La Victoria, are much more dangerous. Visitors would be well advised to stay out of these areas unless accompanied by an experienced native or visiting busy areas during daylight hours. Downtown Lima is normally well patrolled but be careful anyway. Callao (the port, technically a different city) is rather rough: ask for advice before going there if you plan to. The area around the airport is generally safe and well guarded but use common sense while lugging your luggage outside the airport.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Sex"]},"\nStaying safe for adults can also require an understanding of the sexual climate of Peru. In general Peru is a relatively conservative country in the sense of male and female roles, but at the same time Peruvians are extremely open to friendships with foreigners.  Thus, some males can find themselves suddenly the object of flirtation by attractive young Peruvian women, but then be suddenly rejected for having violated some unwritten line of conduct in, say, discussion topics.  Women can find themselves the object of unwanted looks and stares, but at the same time the risk of violence and rape is probably not as high as in many other countries.\n\nA problem that can arise is the Peruvian concept of the ",{"type":"''","value":["pepera"]},", found at certain night clubs or pubs. Peperas are usually attractive women aged 16–25 that deliberately entice foreign tourists and then spike their drinks with sleeping pills and rob them once they're unconscious. Usually peperas work in groups of two, although smaller and larger groups exist as well. Male \"peperos\" also spike the drinks of women but robbery is often accompanied by rape. Peperas in general are found in dense tourist areas, such as Park Kennedy in Miraflores as well as the Plaza de Armas in central Lima. One locale in particular that is notorious for dangerous peperas is the Tequila Rock discoteca in Miraflores and its sister in Pueblo Libre (La Marina). As of July 2013 cases of drink spiking, working with bar staff, have occurred in Albazos restaurant y pisco bar (Berlin 172 in Miraflores).\n\nAnother cultural concept worth learning is the \"brichera\" (or \"brichero\"). There are two types of bricheras: the first type are women that are genuinely looking to meet foreign men in the hopes of dating or marriage or even a quick fling.  The second type are women that search for foreign men with the implicit purpose of  exchanging sex for small gifts or money. This second type of brichera is risky, especially for foreigners lacking local sensibilities, since it involves prostitution.  These bricheras do not use contraception reliably, and therefore pose a higher risk for transmitting STDs (Sexual Transmitted Diseases).  If you decide to have a fling, make sure to use a condom.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Taxis"]},"\nAnother important point to be taken into consideration is that you should not pick up just any taxi, especially when you are leaving the airport. It is not strange to hear news that some taxi drivers cheated tourists (for example, going from the northeast point of the city to the southeast part would take you at most 50 soles and that is the largest distance in Lima so do not pay more than that) by charging them 100 or even 200 soles for normal rides (even though Peruvian taxi drivers normally tend to increase their fares in front of gringos, it is not a massive difference). It is most advisable to use one of the official taxi companies inside the airport (such as Green Taxi) with set fares to ensure your safety.\n\nTaxi drivers have also been known to participate in robberies, express kidnappings or serve as get away vehicles.  While the overwhelming majority of Lima's taxistas are honest hard working people trying to make a living, you should be alert if you are going to hail a taxi on the street, especially if you appear to be wealthy and\/or a foreigner. Your safest bet is to have your hotel call a taxi for you or keep the numbers of official taxi companies (\"radio taxis\", which are marked with registered numbers) handy. Lima's tourist information centers will be willing to call one for you as well.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Embassies"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["Australia"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Australia"],["url=http:\/\/www.australia.org.pe"],["email="],["address=Víctor A.
