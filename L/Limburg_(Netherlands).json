Drug-related crimes are more widespread than in some other Dutch areas, due to Limburg's location on the German and Belgian border and the associated smuggling potential. If you do not seek contact with drug traffickers, however, you are unlikely to notice much of all this. If you just want to smoke a joint, you can go to one of the legalized \"coffee shops,\" but under new laws in the Netherlands, only Dutch citizens can now purchase legal drugs and they need to ID themselves.\n\nFor the rest, common sense will generally be enough to keep you safe. Prostitution is legalized in all of the Netherlands but make sure to use condoms as STD's remain a problem. Pick pocketing isn't nearly as much of a problem as it is in e.g. Amsterdam, but keep an eye on your personal items nonetheless. As in other Dutch regions, you might meet an occasional drug addict or wanderer on the streets, asking for a bug. The social welfare system is pretty well arranged and begging (which is illegal) is often related to drug addiction. Kindly declining is usually enough to fend off soliciting individuals. An exception are homeless people selling \"street newspapers\" (\"straatkrant\"), often at supermarket entrances. This is a legal and organized initiative in the Netherlands which you may support, but sellers should visibly be wearing an ID card.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nLimburg is at \"the corner of Europe\", with long borders with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Belgium"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Germany"]]},".
