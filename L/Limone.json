The narrow, stone-paved streets that wind their way between the high, stone walls of the ancient buildings, and a long promenade, fringed with cafes and restaurants, that culminates in a beach only add to the appeal, making it one of the most popular tourist destinations on the lake.\n\nThis popularity means that Limone is also one of the most touristy places on the lake, which, depending on your perspective, may be a good or a bad thing. It has an abundance of cafes, restaurants and shops selling all manner of souvenirs, food and clothing, and the streets in summer are thronged with tourists. The cafes vie with each other for business and there is often music and even videos blaring from the various establishments.\n\nThe town was popular with writers such as Goethe, Ibsen and Lawrence, and more recently was used for filming parts of the James Bond film Quantum of Solace.\n\nOne of Limone's more obscure claims to fame comes from the discovery of ApoA-1 Milano, a mutant form of apolipoprotein, which reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, and is claimed to be responsible for the high number of people aged over 100 in Limone; more then a dozen for its roughly 1000 inhabitants.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nThe main road from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Salò"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Riva del Garda"]]}," goes through Limone.\n\nFerries ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.navigazionelaghi.it\/eng\/g_crociere.asp"]}," sail between all the major towns on the lake.
