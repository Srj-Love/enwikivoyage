Renamed and made Nebraska's state capital in 1867, it's second-largest city in the state.  As such, it's the state's center of government and higher education and is a regional transportation center.  Even with a population of 240,000, it retains a friendly, \"small town\" feel.\n\nThere are several threads running through Lincoln's cultural composition.  The university and state government have attracted many rural Nebraskans to the city over the years, reinforcing its small town feel.  Its position as a college town also helps shape the city's political culture, which is somewhat more liberal than most of the rest of the state.  Once a very ethnically homogeneous city, it has become more diverse over the past 30 years, welcoming immigrants and refugees from various parts of the globe.\n\nThere is a long-standing friendly rivalry with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Omaha"]]},", 57 mi (92 km) to the northeast.\n\nIndoor work sites are smoke-free in Lincoln, so you'll be able to enjoy smoke-free restaurants and bars.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nThe primary route into the city is I-80, with I-180 serving as a downtown connector.
