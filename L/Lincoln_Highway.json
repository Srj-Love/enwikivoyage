It was one of various \"auto trails\", a motley assortment of named routes marked by private organisations and trail associations (such as the Lincoln Highway Association) in the early days of the mass-produced automobile. These routes pre-dated the numbered US Highway system, which was established in the mid-1920's.\n\nThe Lincoln Highway ran from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New York City"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Francisco"]]}," along roads which would become part of US 1, US 30, US 40, US 93, US 50, US 99 and US 48. The exact routing changed various times over the life of both the auto trails and the US Highway system which replaced it, as roadbuilders attempted to bypass crowded downtown areas or find a shorter path to a destination. In many communities the Lincoln Highway is \"old US 30\", not the current US highway routing.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Prepare"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Route"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["New York"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["New Jersey"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Pennsylvania"]},"\nEntering Pennsylvania via the Ben Franklin Bridge, 30 travels through ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Old City (Philadelphia)"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Center City East (Philadelphia)"],["Center City East"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Center City West (Philadelphia)"],["Center City West"]]},", the historic and commercial centers of the City.
