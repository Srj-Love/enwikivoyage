It is made up of 7 districts which form part of the East Midlands region and 2 unitary authorities which form part of the Yorkshire and Humber region.\n\nLincolnshire has a strong agricultural industry and background which makes a significant contribution to the UK as a whole, with a number of large supermarkets being supplied by farms in the county for fruit, vegetables, meat and dairy products. Other industries include tourism which is particularly strong on the coast, in Lincoln and historic towns such as Stamford. Northern Lincolnshire is on the Humber estuary and is home to heavy industries which are linked to the docks in the area, which also serve the fishing industry.\n\nHistorically, there are many sites in Lincolnshire that date from a range of periods with some such as Lincoln Cathedral dating back nearly 1,000 years. It is also able to boast a number of impressive stately homes and castles built by rich land owners and royalty. The county has religious importance as a result of Methodism having been founded at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Epworth"]]}," by John Wesley. More recently, there are many reminders of the important role Lincolnshire played during World War Two, at its height being home to over 40 RAF bases. It is home to the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight and has 2 of 17 remaining Lancaster Bombers, 1 of which is still airworthy, visitors will often notice untouched pillbox defences scattered in many parts of the county as relics to the county's influential past. Lincolnshire still has a number of large RAF bases and is home to the famous Red Arrows display team.\n\nShopping development have improved gradually over previous years with new centres in Boston, Gainsborough, Grimsby and Lincoln, as well as a popular outlet village near Spalding which is popular with visitors from further afield.

Stamford is said to have the accent that resembles the Queen's English more than any other in the country.
