Those that exist tend to be narrow and often have tourists walking on them. There is a large car park available before entering the settlement on the island. The car park is pay & display, priced at £4.40 for a stay of over 3 hours (correct as of 3rd May, 2008). On-street parking is virtually non-existent. Some B&B establishments may offer parking, however this should be checked when booking.\n\nFrom the car park there is a shuttle bus service to the castle, although visitors need to check if this will be running on the day of their intended visit if they intend on using it. Beyond this and the bus link from the mainland, there is no formal public transport on the island.\n\nIn essence, be prepared to do some walking!
