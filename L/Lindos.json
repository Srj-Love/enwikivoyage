It has only seven hundred inhabitants, greatly outnumbered by tourists in the high season. Being one of the main attractions on the island it is often overcrowded in the mornings when the tourist coaches arrive. These usually depart by 12noon, whisking their patrons off for lunch and the next destination.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]}," \n\nLindos provides a mix of history and beaches. The village has many historic houses (known as \"Captains\" houses) often dating from 16th, 17th or 18th century. The village itself is situated on a network of cobbled streets - all of which are entirely pedestrianised. The only modes of transport possible are donkeys and mopeds. The houses are small, whitewashed and sit beautifully on the hillside making it one of the most beautiful places on the island. The charm of this village is maintained by a preservation order which forbids any unauthorised building work to change it.\n\nLegend has it that the village was set up by one of the divine sons of Zeus. It was in fact established by Dorians around 1000BC.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nA taxi from the airport will cost €63. They can be haggled lower if you play hard to get.

A ticket costs  €5.00, 1-way. Lindos can also be reached by boat from the Mandraki harbour in Rhodes. Good tour operators for Lindos include Direct Greece and Olympic Holidays and - all of which have a wide range of apartments and villas for all different family groupings. (Be warned that tour operators Kosmar & Libra have gone into liquidation.)\n\nYou can park outside the city. There are blue \"non-free spaces\" ",{"type":"''","value":["intermixed"]}," with free spaces beyond the large \"supermarket\" parking. To get to the city, once you are at the \"supermarket\" parking, go down and after a while you'll have to choices at the last parking plaza: enter the city through a small side street, or go down to the beach, walk to the other end and climb up to the city.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nLindos is a small town, so walking around on foot is a decent option. However, as Lindos is built on the side of a steep hill, the roads can be quite difficult, and climbing up to the acropolis is definitely an effort. There are two alternatives. A bus will bring you down from the main arrival bus stop outside the center of the city to a square closer to the sea - it's not far, but quite a change in elevation. If you wish to go on top of the acropolis, you can rent a ride on a donkey for about € 6.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Rhodos_Lindos_Street_R02.jpg"],["thumb"],["right}250px"],["Exploring the town"]]},"\n\nThe main attraction of Lindos is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["town"]}," itself, winding paths between small traditional whitewashed buildings.

There is also the remains of an Ancient Amphitheatre carved into the slope of the Acropolis.  If you wish to avoid the tiring climb you can hire a donkey at the entrance of the town. Walking up the road that leads high up to the acropolis, the first ruins you will encounter are the medieval walls. In the early 14th century the Crusaders built fortifications upon the remains of earlier defenses, from both the Byzantine era and more ancient times.
