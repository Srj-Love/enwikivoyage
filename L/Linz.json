The city had its ups and downs: In the antiquity, Linz was a border post of the Roman Empire. In the Middle Ages, it was a budy town with crafts and trading, mainly profiting from its geographic location on the Danube River, and having one of the few permanent bridges. Then its fate turned badly: A well-known dictator (Adolf Hitler), who was born in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Braunau"]]}," some two hours away, choose Linz to become the \"City of the Führer.\" Besides some buildings and the main bridge built by war captives, he was mainly interested in the huge chemical and metal industry: What is now ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.voest.com VOEST"]}," was the \"Hermann Göring Werke\", and what is now the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.chemiepark.at\/start\/ Chemiepark Linz"]}," was the infamous \"IG Farben\".\n\nIn World War II, the city was heavily bombed - and was one of the few cities of Nazi Germany that escaped total destruction. The boom in the fifties served as an economic booster, but made Linz a city with somehow the worst air quality of Austria. After the industrial transformation in the late 80s and 90s, the importance of industry considerably declined. What remains, is the image of a \"Steel City\", and Linz used this image.\n\nConsequently, Linz does not have a sizable \"Altstadt\" (old town) it may be disappointing to those tourists familiar with the charm of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Graz"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Salzburg"]]},". Linz is primarily a student and industrial town and while not particularly beautiful, is more representative of a \"real\" Austrian city vs. the almost fairy tale like quality of Salzburg.\n\nInstead, Linz focuses on contemporary items: Museums, architecture and art. The city gets a lot of international media attention because of its annual ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.aec.at Ars Electronica Festival"]},"; an international festival for Electronic Art. It also hosts the \"Klangwolke\" (\"sound-cloud\"); a big cultural Open-Air spectacle with modern and traditional music and a massive light show, which is held in September.
