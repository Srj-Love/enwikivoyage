There are many routes on the island from easy to hard level. The level of difficulty depends on the season. Some tracks are very hard or almost impossible to follow during summer because of the heat. There are maps to be bought on Lipari but one has to ask local people to find some of the tracks.\n\nA short walk downhill can be done on the road from Quattropani to Acquacalda on the north side of Lipari. This can be done even during summer and takes about 45 minutes. You enjoy the view of Salina and the northern Aeolian islands during this walk.\nFrom the Old Kaolin Mine between Pianoconte and Quattropani it is possible to walk to the thermal bath of San Calogero or to the village of Quattropani. Downhill near the sea there is the ruin of a Saracen tower and fifthy meters away it is possible to walk down on the black clifs for a bath. Do these to walks during springtime.\nFrom Marina Corta there is a track up to Monte Gallina and Monte della Guardia. You reach the west side of the island and will enjoy the two Faraglioni from upside. You are able to reach the street that takes you from the vulcanologic observatory in front of Vulcano, back to Lipari town. You should do this hike late afternoon during summer.\nDuring afternoon in summer you can also make a walk from the church of Santa Lucia in Lipari to Valle Muria, the beach on the west side of Lipari.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Museo Archeologico Regionale Eoliano"],["alt=Museo Archeologico Luigi Bernabò Brea"],["url=http:\/\/www.regione.sicilia.it\/beniculturali\/museolipari\/pagina.asp?Id=1"],["email=museo.arche.brea@regione.sicilia.it"],["address=Via Del Castello"],["lat=38.4675"],["long=14.9572"],["directions=in the old castle"],["phone=+39 0909880174-0594"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Open daily, closed 1:30-3:00PM"],["price=€6"],["content=A spectacular (if limited in breadth) collection of artifacts recovered from archaeological sites in the Aeolian Islands, including many from shipwrecks.

You should ask for air conditioning as in most cases the houses are rebuilt with thin walls with no thermal isolation and the rooms get terribly hot. There are older houses with thick cooling walls but these are not easy to find.\n\nDuring winter time Lipari is ideal for trekking and you could therefore find a house in villages like Pianoconte or Quattropani. One thing to think about is that the houses are not built for heating. So you should get with you warm clothes and if possible a \"bed heater\". The temperature outside get down to 0-10 Celsius but very seldom below 0.\n\nIf you want to stay in a more luxury hotel, try: \n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Arciduca"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.arciduca.it"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Hotel Mea"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.hotelmealipari.it"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Villa Enrica"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.villaenrica.it"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\nIf you want to stay in a near the beach hotel, try: \n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Hotel Cutimare in Acquacalda"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.hotelcutimarelipari.it"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Hotel Amarea in Canneto"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.hotelamarealipari.it"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\nIf you prefer a peaceful house ideal for trekking: \n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Villa Fiorentino"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.villafiorentino.it"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=B&B Diana Brown"],["url=http:\/\/www.dianabrown.it\/en_index.html"],["email="],["address=Vico Himera 3, Lipari town centre"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+39 338 6407572"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["38.4667"],["14.9500"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Aeolian Islands"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Lipari"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Europe\/Italy\/Sicily\/Localities\/Lipari\/"]]}]
