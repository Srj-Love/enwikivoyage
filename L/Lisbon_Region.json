The region includes a variety of localities, from historic towns and cities, through ports, industrial areas, beach resorts and natural reserves. It therefore offers a varied mixture of holiday opportunities to the travellers, as you can engage both in traditional beach activities, various active sports and do a fair share of inspiring sightseeing.\n\nPortugal has a multi-layered and quite complicated system of administrative divisions, which is not always useful for the tourists.
