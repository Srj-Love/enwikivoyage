It is surrounded by very pretty coastal hinterland, and it is worthwhile taking one of the scenic drives around the area. It is in some ways the administrative centre of the Northern Rivers region. It has the main hospital, fairly large courthouse, as well as a university and a shopping centre. \n\nThe Wilsons River runs through town, however like many inland rivers in Australia it is brown in colour due to sediment, so some people may not wish to swim in it.  The water is safe for swimming.  Hector, the freshwater crocodile, once escaped from a travelling show and made his home in the river, but he hasn't been sighted since the floods of 1974. \n\nIf you don't feel like swimming, there is a riverside park by the bridge.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Lismore rainbowtrain.jpg"],["thumb"],["The rainbow train at Heritage Park"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Art & Music:"]}," Lismore boasts an abundance of artists and musicians, with many pop-up galleries in shop windows, graffiti artistry like the Back Alley Gallery and of course the Lismore Regional Art Gallery which hosts locals and  many famous artists' exhibitions throughout the year.
