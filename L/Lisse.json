Consecutive wars caused wide spread poverty in the Middle Ages, and peat harvesting and agricultural activities were the region's main source of income. This changed when the production of flower bulbs gained popularity in the region. The local sandy soils proved very suited for the growth of tulips and other bulbeous flowers, bringing economic growth and wealth to Lisse and the surrounding regions. In late medieval times, the area of Lisse belonged to the gardens and hunting grounds of Slot Teylingen, a castle in nearby ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Teylingen"]]}," of which now only ruins remain. Among that castle's most prominent inhabitants was Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut, who lived there in the 15th century. Legend has it that herbs for her kitchen ('keuken', in Dutch) were gathered where the Keukenhof is now, hence the name of the park.\n\nThe current Keukenhof Castle (opposite the Keukenhof park) was build around 1642, by Adriaen Maertensz. Block, who had served as a captain and commander for the VOC on the Maluku Islands. In 1840 the castle's park was re-designed by Zocher and son, who also designed the famous Vondelpark in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amsterdam"]]},". This design laid the foundations for the current park. The castle was extended in 1865 and has been thoroughly renovated in recent years.\n\nThe Keukenhof tulip gardens were created only in 1949, as a flower exposition initiated by Lisse's mayor and some prominent local flower bulb growers. Since it's opening in 1950, visitor numbers rapidly increased.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nKeukenhof is situated between Haarlem and Leiden on the N208.
