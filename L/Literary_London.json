This part of the Abbey was not originally destined as a burial place for writers, playwrights and poets; the first poet to be buried here, Geoffrey Chaucer, was laid to rest here on account of his more mundane position as Clerk of Works to the Palace of Westminster - the fact that he had authored the ",{"type":"''","value":["Canterbury Tales"]}," was irrelevant at the time.\n\nDuring the flowering of English literature in the 16th century over 150 years later, however, a more elaborate tomb was erected to Chaucer by Nicholas Brigham and in 1599 Edmund Spenser was laid to rest nearby. These two tombs formed the nucleus of a tradition that developed over succeeding centuries.\n\nIn addition to Chaucer and Spenser, Poets' Corner contains the later ",{"type":"'''","value":["burials"]}," of poets John Dryden, Tennyson, Robert Browning and John Masefield. Writers of prose, including William Camden, Dr Samuel Johnson, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Rudyard Kipling and Thomas Hardy are also buried here.\n\nThe grave of Charles Dickens attracts special devotion from many visitors interest: as a writer who drew attention to the hardships born by the socially deprived and who advocated the abolition of the slave trade, he won enduring fame and gratitude and today, more than 110 years later, a wreath is still laid on his tomb on the anniversary of his death each year.\n\nAs well as actual burials, Poets' Corner also commemorates the life of literary greats (and quite a few who have faded into obscurity) with ",{"type":"'''","value":["memorials"]},": amongst these are the poets John Milton, William Wordsworth, Thomas Gray, John Keats, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Robert Burns, William Blake, T.S. Eliot and Gerard Manley Hopkins. Writers such as Samuel Butler, Jane Austen, Oliver Goldsmith, Sir Walter Scott, John Ruskin, Charlotte, Emily and Anne Brontë, Henry James and Sir John Betjeman have also been given memorials here. Perhaps the greatest English writer, William Shakespeare, also has a memorial here: buried in his home town of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Stratford-upon-Avon"]]}," in 1616, Shakespeare had to wait until 1740 before his monument (designed by William Kent) was placed in the transept. Another late addition was Lord Byron, whose lifestyle caused a scandal although his poetry was much admired: although he died in 1824, he was finally given a memorial only in 1969.\n\nNot all who are buried in Poets' Corner were literary in background: the burial place of the famous composer George Frederic Handel can also be seen here, as well as the graves of David Garrick, the 18th century Shakespearean actor, and Laurence Olivier, actor of our age. A number of Abbey churchmen are also interred amongst the poets.\n\nOscar Wilde's monument, to the east of Trafalgar Square: \"We are all in the gutter but some of us are looking at the stars\" (",{"type":"''","value":["Lady Windermere's Fan"]},")\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Literary Tours and Walks"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.walks.com\/ London Walks"]}]}," - very popular guided walks (£5 per person), such as: ",{"type":"''","value":["Shakespeare's London"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["In the Footsteps of Sherlock Holmes"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["The London of Oscar Wilde"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/homepages.pavilion.co.uk\/users\/tartarus\/adventure.html London Adventure"]}]}," - an informal literary group dedicated to public readings and specialist literary tours"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.angelwalks.co.uk Angel Weekend Walks"]}]}," - literary & historical strolls (£6 per person \/ £5 concs) ",{"type":"'''","value":["Charles Dickens"]}," and Islington, ",{"type":"'''","value":["George Orwell"]},"'s Islington, Islington Murder Mile also provides great detail on ",{"type":"'''","value":["Joe Orton"]},"."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/mostcurioustours.com\/arts-culture-tours\/london\/ The Literary London Walking Tour"]}]}," - an interesting, informative and funny walk through London and its literary hotspots of the past and present.
