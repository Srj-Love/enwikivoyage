Trains only stop there on request, so talk to the staff before joining the train.

The train goes forward along a section of the track, the points are changed, and then it reverses onto the next track section.  The track section is long bypassed by the main line, which now winds through tunnels to make its descent.  The tourist trains that used to operate on this track section have been suspended, but will hopefully reopen in 2014.\n\nYou can use the fire trails and dirt roads above Lithgow to get to places like the Lost City rock formations.

It is an old railway tunnel and the glowworms have taken up residence.  The tunnel is a 1km easy and pretty walk from the carpark, use a car with a good ground clearance or 4 wheel drive, and well worth a visit.  As the tunnel is long a turns a corner it is very dark in the centre of the tunnel.
