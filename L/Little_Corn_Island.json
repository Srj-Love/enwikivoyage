Many have English surnames. \n\nTourism on the island is still in its infancy, and what is there is small, basic and, thus far, fairly eco-friendly. Some of the places to stay rely on solar and wind power for their electricity, and many have their own wells which draw drinkable water and\/or collect rain water. The people are typically friendly, laid back and genuine.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nAlmost everyone on the island speaks both passable ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Spanish phrasebook"],["Spanish"]]}," and English, the latter being the first language of most who are native to the island. The English spoken, however, is heavily Caribbean, and real communication can be far from effortless. There are many inhabitants who have come over from mainland Nicaragua and consequently speak Spanish as a first language, and others who speak Miskito and other Caribbean languages or dialects.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nWhen you come to the Corn Islands, remember this statement: Since you have to fly in to Big Corn, and many people assume that both islands are similar, they tend to stay on the \"Big\" island for several days, and save the last day or 2 for Little Corn. The most overheard statement on Little Corn is \"Wow, this is so much better (more beautiful, cleaner, more natural, nicer, better amenities, diving, hotels, etc), I should have come here sooner!\"  And anyone who doesn't have a stockholders meeting or a graduation to get back to, almost invariably finds a way to stay longer than they had planned. It's not at all uncommon for someone to come for a few days, only to stay for a month or more. Many calls are made to change flights. So the point is, if you plan your stay for longer, or to just go direct to Little Corn on the panga right after your flight arrives, you'll have listened to the best advice there is about a trip there.\n\nAlmost everyone reaches the island via the twice-daily ",{"type":"''","value":["panga"]}," (ferry), which leaves ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Big Corn Island"]]}," at 10AM and 4:30PM, and leaves Little Corn at 6:30AM and 1:30PM. The price of the ",{"type":"''","value":["panga"]}," is 130 Cordobas (US$6). The ride takes between 30 and 45 minutes and can sometimes get pretty rough. The back of the boat is less rough, while the front is less wet. Sitting on your life vest will help ease the pain in your ass on the rough days. As much as some people love the breakneck speed the drivers used to cross at, they have become more considerate of the more fragile on board in recent years.\n\nYou'll need to reconfirm your flight from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Big Corn Island"]]}," back to the mainland 24 hours before; if you're patronizing one of the dive shops they'll do it for you, or the Dolphin Hotels (Los Dolphines) internet cafe, or Farm Peace and Love's internet cafe if you stay on the North end of the island.  If you are staying on the East Side of the island (Cocal Beach), Casa Iguana offers an internet cafe and\/or Little Corn Beach and Bungalow offer satellite WiFi with your own device. Tranquilo Cafe will also let you use their cell phone to confirm, or their WiFi for a Skype or Google Voice call. They also have a house laptop if you don't have Wi-Fi ready device.\n\nSchedules change, routes shift and transportation can be unpredictable.
