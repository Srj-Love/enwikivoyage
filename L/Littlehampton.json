[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Littlehampton Harbour, West Sussex.jpg"],["thumb"],["350px"],["Littlehampton Harbour"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Littlehampton"]}," is a seaside town in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["West Sussex"]]},". It lies midway on the Sussex coast between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bognor Regis"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Worthing"]]},". It is approximately just over 15 miles west from the larger tourist area of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brighton (England)"],["Brighton"]]}," and 55 miles south of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nLittlehampton lies on the mouth River Arun, around four miles South of the historic settlement of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Arundel (England)"],["Arundel"]]},". Like its coastal neighbours, the town is a product of the 19th Century, and features all the usual quirks of a Victorian seaside resort. The town Centre itself is around a 5-10 walk minute inshore, and features all the usual staples and amenities of a medium sized provincial town. \n\nLittlehampton is often considered to have a grittier, more industrial culture than most of its companions along the shore, a reputation perhaps gained from the maritime nature of the town. The East banks of the river Arun were, until the turn of the millennium, dedicated to plundering the many spoils of the river, and it was only in the early 2000s that this tradition began to subside. The urbanised Eastern shore of the River has now been massively redeveloped, and is now home to a selection of flats and apartments, a riverside walkway, and the towns visitor Centre - the aptly named 'Look and Sea Centre,' which features an observation tower. The Western Shore of the River remains largely untouched, populated only with a few houses and the towns marina and golf club. The beach here, West Beach, features some of Britain's most unspoilt examples of Sand Dunes.\n\nAway from the town centre and the seafront, the town is a rather unspectacular suburban affair, the only location of note being the Body Shop's World Headquarters, located in Littlehampton thanks to the town's most famous resident, the late Anita Roddick, having grown up  here.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nThe A259, one of the main south coast routes, runs through the northern fringes of the town, and the town centre\/seafront are clearly signposted along this route. From the north, Littlehampton is linked to London via the A24 and the A280 or the more scenic A29 via the A284 and Arundel. There are a number of car-parks in the town centre, which operate partly on a disc-based system. Discs are easily obtained from local stores and offer free parking for 2 hours. Alternatively, more traditional pay and display methods are available, both in town centre and seafront locations - though it should be noted that the beach is never more than a 10 minute casual walk from the town centre.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nLittlehampton is served by a branch line, and train services in and out of the town are operated by Southern Railway. Littlehampton station, just west of the town centre, is around 1 hour 45 minutes from London Victoria, and 45 minutes from Brighton along the coast. There are regular services between the town and the capital, at least two an hour until around 10pm, and the nearby settlements of Portsmouth, Chichester, Worthing and Bognor Regis are also well served from the station, all reachable in under an hour.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\nLondon's Gatwick Airport is actually as close to Littlehampton as it is London.  It is easily reached by both direct rail services and road, both in around 50 minutes.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nThe Coastliner 700 service links the town westwards to Portsmouth and eastwards to Brighton, and has its main stop adjacent to the Waitrose supermarket on Anchor Springs in the heart of the town centre. However, rail services are similarly well connected and faster, and thus bus travel is perhaps mostly useful for shorter journeys.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["On foot"]},"\nThe main attractions of the town, notably the seafront, are generally within a 15 minute radius of both the station and the main town centre car-parks. Undoubtedly the best way to get between the beach and the town\/station is via the recently regenerated river walkway, which can be reached at a number of points from River Road. The unspoilt natural beauty of West Beach and the Marina is also connected from here, across the red pedestrian-only drawbridge easily visible from the walkway in the opposite direction to the main seafront attractions.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By cycle"]}," \nOn-road and off-road cycle routes to, from and across the town have recently been notably improved. Designated routes into the town centre are now clearly marked, and are also largely segregated from areas of traffic. Unfortunately however, there exists no provisions for bike hire within the local area.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nBus services from Anchor Springs are useful if wanting to travel into suburbs\/nearby towns not connected by rail, notably Rustington, East Preston and, to the North, Lyminster.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Silk Road Turkish Mediterranean Restaurant"],["url=http:\/\/www.thesilkroadrestaurant.net"],["email="],["address=8-10 Arcade Rd"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=first turning off Beach Road (from the North)"],["phone = +44 1903 722055"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Tu-Su noon-11PM"],["price="],["content=Theatrical and interesting Mediterranean restaurant with flamboyant and sumptuous decor, authentically prepared cuisine and a wide variety of live entertainment, including belly dancers, dj hosted party nights, latin, gypsy and acoustic jazz bands, quiz nights and table magicians.
