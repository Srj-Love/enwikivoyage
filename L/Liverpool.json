Historically the city served as one of the leading ports linking Europe to the Americas, expanding to become England's second most populated city by the census of 1861, before slowly declining after 1921 as levels of transatlantic shipping dropped. Before airline travel, many Europeans migrating to the New World passed through the city, particularly the Italians and Irish; to this day the city enjoys a large Irish community, with impressive cathedrals for both Anglican and Roman Catholic faiths. In the 18th and early 19th century the port also acted as a gateway for the slave trade, with echoes of this period still evident in places around the city (Penny Lane is named after a slave ship owner, for example). Recent years have seen a comprehensive regeneration of the city centre, creating an influx of new shops, boutiques, and large performance\/conference arenas near the waterfront; this has resulted in an upturn in population figures.  The regenerated city now plays regular host to national and international conference, media and music events; examples include major political party conferences, the BBC Worldwide Showcase, the MTV Europe Awards, and the Global Entrepreneurship Congress.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:The Three Graces, Liverpool - 2012-05-27.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["The Three Graces, Pier Head, Liverpool"]]},"\nLiverpool is a city with great cultural heritage and was awarded the title of ",{"type":"'''","value":["European Capital of Culture 2008"]},", with the famous ",{"type":"'''","value":["Pier Head Waterfront"]}," being a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["UNESCO World Heritage"]]}," site since 2004.

Buses run out from the centre regularly from Liverpool ONE Bus Station (mainly to the south) and Queen Square (mainly north\/east). Both bus stations have travel centres with staff who will assist with which bus to get and from where. These travel centres also stock free transport guides and detailed timetable leaflets for each bus and train service. Highly recommended are the free 'map and guide' leaflets of the four main transport areas: Liverpool, Wirral, Southport and St. Helens; these giant fold-out street maps show at a glance the route of every bus service (individual service leaflets are required for timetable information).\n\nIn terms of pre-paid travel passes, Saveaway, Solo and Trio travel passes can be purchased from travel centres or Merseyrail stations.  Liverpool and its surrounding areas are divided up into areas, each sub-divided into zones: the cost of each ticket typically depends upon how many zones\/areas the purchaser wants to travel in.

Solo tickets may be used only on buses; Trio tickets may be used on buses, ferries or Merseyrail trains.  The initial pass may only be purchased from Merseytravel centres, but once acquired may be renewed (up to three days before expiry) at any travel or train station in Merseyside.  It is possible to renew Solo or Trio tickets by any duration: for example, it is permitted to add just a single week onto a ticket initially purchased as a monthly ticket."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Saveaway tickets are ideal for the majority of short term visitors, such as tourists.  They are cheap, disposable, off-peak (after 9:30AM) single-day tickets that cover buses, ferries and Merseyrail trains.

Saveaway tickets may be bulk purchased in advance; each ticket is a scratch card that allows the owner to choose its date of use. They may also be used by more than one person (although not at the same time, obviously!) They are priced at £3.40 for unlimited off-peak travel in 'Area C' (covering the city centre, west out to Huyton, north to Crosby and south to Speke), and £4.60 for an 'All-Zone' ticket covering the whole of the Merseytravel area (perfect for visiting the Wirral, Chester or Southport)."]},"\nThe main 'metro style' train stations in the city centre are Central, Lime Street, Moorfields and James Street. Lime Street is the terminus for many national lines and the local city line to Manchester. Moorfields is just off Dale Street, ideal for the business centre of Liverpool and Central is usually used by shoppers and visitors. Local trains run very frequently between Hunts Cross, Kirkby, Ormskirk and Southport on the Northern line. They run every 15 minutes from Monday to Saturday and 30 minutes on Sunday. Central station is the main station for the Northern line, although the 'loop' links the three main city centre stations. The Wirral line forms the link between the Lime Street, Moorfields and Central, so all of these stations act as an interchange between the City, Northern and Wirral lines.\n\nA new station in the south of Liverpool replaced the old Garston and Allerton stations in June 2006. This links the Northern and City lines and is ideal for the airport. It also acts as an interchange for a number of local buses.\n\nAdult bus fares on the main operators are:\nArriva flat fare of £1.90 throughout the Liverpool area, £3.70 for Liverpool area Day Ticket, £4.40 for Northwest area.\nStagecoach flat fare of £1.80 throughout the Liverpool area, £3.30 for Liverpool area Day Ticket, £3.60 for Northwest area.\nArriva and Stagecoach Day and Weekly tickets my be used on either companies buses on new Quality Partnership Routes 10\/10A\/10B\/10C(Huyton,St Helens), 86\/86A\/86D\/86E(Speke,Airport,South Parkway), 53\/53A (Crosby,Aintree), 14\/14X (Croxteth,Kirkby)\nSimilar flat fares are available from the other operators as well.\nThere are also limited night bus services on a Saturday night costing £3.00.\n\nSome buses are subsidised by Merseytravel, such as early morning and hospital services, and there is a fixed fare of £1.10. This includes the City Centre Circular buses C1 to C5.\n\nIf you plan to travel a lot, a prepaid pass presents much better value.

You are no more likely to be a victim here than most other European cities. However, as in other cities, you should observe a few simple precautions. Don't leave valuables on display in an unattended car, for example. Even an empty car will get a smashed window from time to time, so try to park yours at private parks when the night comes. Try to stay aware of your surroundings and be discreet with cash, expensive camera equipment, etc.\n\nScousers are mainly gregarious and friendly people, but there are still many who seek to take advantage. You will find, however, that Mancunians and Scousers get along much better than the stereotype suggests and you will very often come across each in each other's city. Be particularly aware of people who approach you in the street with stories of having lost their train fare home. These are typically begging techniques.\n\nStay on the beaten track at night and stick to the many themed pub and bars and avoid some of the larger dance clubs as these are more suited to streetwise locals or people who understand Liverpool culture well, although to be fair, most Scousers will welcome anyone to their city, and especially their clubs! Be prepared to wait for a taxi at night and don't be tempted to walk back to your hotel unless you are close by. Although Liverpool is a quite friendly place, a slightly sinister side appears after hours.\n\nSome of the City's districts should be avoided by non-locals. Areas such as Croxteth, Dovecot, Everton, Huyton, Kensington, Kirkdale, Norris Green, Page Moss, Stockbridge Village and Toxteth are seeing some serious issues with gang related violence including increases in gun and knife crime and several murders have been recorded.\n\nAround the city centre, be aware there are ",{"type":"''","value":["many"]}," homeless people, especially around William Brown Street near the museums. Unlike, in, say, the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United States of America"]]}," or other parts of the United Kingdom, these are less likely to pose a threat to you, and although they may beg for money, they tend to be friendly and often want to talk about their backstories openly with you. Give them money, but ",{"type":"'''","value":["at your own risk"]},", as long as it's small change.\n\nAlso, older women ",{"type":"''","value":["may"]}," (and often ",{"type":"''","value":["do"]},") flirt with younger men, but accept this part of the Liverpool cultural milieu. This also applies to the homelessness situation mentioned above, which much the same situation tends to happen. This should ",{"type":"'''","value":["not"]}," be confused with prostitution (mentioned below). It is explicitly ",{"type":"'''","value":["not"]}," solicitation, and is just flirting.\n\nAlthough prostitution is legal in the UK, solicitation is illegal and it is a fact of life in most cities, Liverpool being no exception. The \"Red Light\" areas are as follows: around Netherfield Road North and the Shiel Road area of Kensington. Although quiet during the day, there is a lot of business at night and particularly on weekends. Women walking by themselves have been known to be approached by men looking for prostitutes and people in vehicles have been known to be approached by prostitutes looking for business.\n\nAvoid Manchester United shirts, which worn in the wrong place makes you an easy target for abuse or worse even assault, especially on match day.\n\nA friendly manner, a polite smile, and a sense of humour go a long way in this city, but a sensible approach to travelling is, as always, advisable.\n\nBe aware that the streetlighting (Urbis Evolo 2, shown ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/lh6.ggpht.com\/-Alsq8SAW3cE\/TbBbq6nGB5I\/AAAAAAAADFo\/E2am3eMYI24\/047.jpg on the right-hand side of the picture"]},") is brighter than you might expect, and drive more cautiously. These streetlights are common across the city centre and in Kensington. Drive much more cautiously if you see them. These are less common outside of Liverpool. Americans may be used to bright lights, but Evolos are ",{"type":"''","value":["really"]}," bright.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:One Angel Square during night, December 2012.jpg"],["thumb"],["Less than an hour away, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Manchester"]]}," holds a wealth of sights and attractions."]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Manchester"]]}]}," – Once the home of the industrial revolution, it has now swapped its chimneys for skyscrapers, and mill workers for urbanite accountants and designers.
