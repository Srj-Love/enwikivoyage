Established in 1759, Liverpool was once known as Ogomikigeak (dry sandy place) and Ogukegeok (place of departure) by the Mi'kmaq.  Samuel de Champlain later named the harbour Port Rossignol after the captain who was using the harbour for fur trading.  \nThe expulsion of the Acadians set the stage for New England Planters to found Liverpool, naming the town after Lord Liverpool, head of the Board of Trade and Plantations.  Initially sympathetic to the cause of the American Revolution, residents eventually \"rebelled against the rebellion\" after American Privateers repeatedly attacked local shipping, even the town itself.  The golden age of the Liverpool Privateer had begun.  During the remainder of the American Revolution, through the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812, Liverpool privateer vessels preyed on enemy ships in the West Indies and North Atlantic. \n\nAn important harbour for the export of forestry products, ship building and fishing, Liverpool enjoyed a comfortable existence until the mid-19th Century.  The new star of the ship building world, steel, ruined Liverpool's wooden ship industry and the failure of two local banks crippled the local economy. \n\nProhibition in the United States allowed Liverpool to become a rum running centre in the 1920's.  The town's fortunes were further bolstered with the 1929 completion of the Mersey Paper Company in Brooklyn and a new era dawned in the town.\n\nToday Liverpool is part of the larger Region of Queens Municipality and enjoys a thriving festival season.  Surrounded by quiet, unspoiled white sand beaches and protected wilderness areas, Liverpool makes a great year round hub for travellers looking for good food, culture and nature activities.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nLiverpool is located 90 minutes away from both Yarmouth and Halifax on Highway 103 on the South Shore of Nova Scotia.  \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By car"]}," \nFrom Halifax, get on Highway 102 North (Bayers Rd.), then take Exit 1A toward Highway 3\/Highway 333\/Peggy's Cove\/South Shore\/Yarmouth.
