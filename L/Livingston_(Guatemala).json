The only access points are via the ocean or the river. By river, you take a lancha (powered boat) from Rio Dulce township located at the mouth of the lake and the Rio Dulce river (intersections of roads CA13 and 7E). This route can take as little as 1 hour or as much as 2.5. The difference is due to some lancheros offer a tour, whereas others just transportation to and from. If you visit by way of Puerto Barrios, find the Municipal dock (Muelle Municipal) and take a lancha that crosses the Amatique bay. This trip offers no tours and it is much faster--around 40 minutes.  \n\nA ferry leaves Puerto Barrios for Livingston Monday to Saturday at sometime in the morning (sometime around 11:00, but confirm first) and at 17:00. It costs 10 Quetzales. Collectivo Lanchas from Puerto Barrios to Livingston leave all day and cost 35 Quetzales (August 2011).\n\nAnother option is to visit from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Punta Gorda (Belize)"],["Punta Gorda"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Belize"]]}," on Tuesdays and Fridays for US$17(there is a BLZ 37.5 departure tax at the immigration office located at the dock).

When arriving from another country make sure to check in with immigration(500 feet uphill from the dock) to get your entry stamp.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nLivingston is a very small town and it does not take long to become familiar with the place. The main street running through Livingston is Calle Principal. The majority of the towns shops, restaurants and bars are situated on this road.

Make sure you negotiate the price in advance!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThe people of Livingston are a mixture of the Black Garifuna, Spanish Guatemalans and Mayan Guatemalans. A number of languages are spoken including Spanish, Garifuna and English is also widely spoken. \n\nLivingston has two not very impressive beaches. The beach to the North of Livingston is unclean and is patrolled by armed police as there have been a number of recorded incidents there in the past. The central beach is pleasant enough, although grass grows into the water at various points. Children come here to fly kites most evenings and this is a friendly beach where the locals come to swim. Sometimes (usually after a period of bad weather) the beaches are full of plastic waste from Belize. The government sends out workers to collect that and clean the beaches, though.\n\nOther beaches close to Livingston include ",{"type":"<","value":["b",["Playa Quehueche"]]}," which is a few kilometres along the Northern coast, and ",{"type":"<","value":["b",["Playa Blanca"]]}," which is 12km along the North coast. \n\n5km to the North of Livingston are the beautiful waterfalls known as ",{"type":"<","value":["b",["Los Siete Altares"]]},".
