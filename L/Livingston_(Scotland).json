It is located approximately 15 miles (25 km) west of Edinburgh and 30 miles (50 km) east of Glasgow, and is bordered by the towns of Broxburn to the northeast and Bathgate to the northwest.\n\nLivingston is the largest town in the West Lothian area. It was built around a collection of small villages, Livingston Village, Bellsquarry and Livingston Station (now Nether Dechmont or Deans ). It contains a number of residential precincts or areas. These include Craigshill, Howden, Dedridge, Ladywell, Knightsridge, Murieston, Adambrae, Deans and Eliburn. Its neighbouring villages include Polbeth, West Calder, East Calder, Mid Calder, Uphall Station and Pumpherston. Livingston itself is the 7th largest town in Scotland, based on 2004 population estimates. The 2001 census showed the town had a population of 50,826 (24,451 male and 26,375 female) and an urban agglomeration population (including Mid Calder and East Calder) of 59,511.\n\nLivingston is also the second largest settlement in the Lothians after Edinburgh. Until 1963 the area surrounding the ancient village of Livingston was open farm land. The name was taken from this village which dates back to 12th Century when a Flemish entrepreneur called De Leving was granted land in the area. He built a fortified tower which is long since gone and the settlement that grew up around it became known as Levingstoun, Layingston and eventually Livingston.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Road"]},"\n\nLivingston has excellent connections to the central Scotland road network. The M8 bounds Livingston in the north. A899 dual carriageway spine road passes north south along Livingston's eastern edge and connects the M8 in the north to the A71 in the South and has the A89 to the west.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Bus"]},"\n\nLivingston has a central bus terminal located on Almondvale Avenue between the two shopping centres in the town centre. This provides regular services to surrounding towns and villages. First Group are the main bus operator in Livingston, other operators include E&M Horsburgh, Passenger Travel, Blue Bus, Davidsons Buses, SD Travel, Prentice Westwood and Nordi Travel. Livingston has buses to Glasgow, Edinburgh, Edinburgh Airport, Ocean Terminal, Oban, Lanark and Falkirk . There are 7 stances at the bus terminal.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Rail"]},"\n\nLivingston has two railway stations; Livingston North and Livingston South. Livingston North is located adjacent to the Carmondean Shopping Centre between Eliburn and Deans and sits on the Edinburgh - Bathgate - Glasgow Queen Street - Helensburgh line. Livingston South is located at the Murieston Shops and sits on the Edinburgh - Shotts - Motherwell - Glasgow Central Line.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Airports"]},"\n\nLivingston is 15 km west of Edinburgh Airport which has regular flights to UK and international destinations.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nPublic transport in Livingston is mainly by bus. The busses are more expensive and less regular than city busses, but are still usable. Unless you are visiting people that live nearby, most of the interesting things in livingston are all within a small radius and can easily be reached by foot.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nAfter almost 50 years of rapid growth, what was once \"Livingston New Town\" has for some time just been known as Livingston.\n\nLivingston was the fourth of the Scottish new towns built to accommodate overspill from Glasgow's highly populated city centre following the Second World War.\n\nLivingston now covers over ten square miles of the River Almond valley to the south of the line of the M8 motorway, and has a population of around 50,000. The key to Livingston's success has been its location just 15 miles west of Edinburgh and 30 east of Glasgow.\n\nAt the heart of Livingston is the Almondvale Shopping Centre. Parts of this date back to the early 1970s, but it has grown steadily since.\n\nAs for the name of the town, it was taken from the existing Livingston Village, one of a number of old settlements which add character to their newer neighbours. Livingston actually dates back to the 1100s when a Flemish entrepreneur called De Leving was granted land in the valley. He built a fortified tower, and the settlement that grew up around it became known as Levingstoun and, later, Livingston.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Racing Karts"]},"\n\nArrol Square\nDeans, Livingston\nEH54 8QZ\nTelephone: +44 1506 410 123\nOpen 7 days 10am - 10pm\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Ten pin Bowling"]},"\n\nDeer Park Golf and Country Club\nGolf Course Road \nLivingston, West Lothian \nEH54 8AB \nTelephone : +44 1506 446 699\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Game of Golf"]},"\n\nDeer Park Golf and Country Club\nGolf Course Road \nLivingston, West Lothian \nEH54 8AB \nTelephone : +44 1506 446 699\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["BUBBLES LEISURE POOL"]},"\n\nAlmondvale Boulevard\nLivingston\nWest Lothian\nEH54 6QT\nTelephone: +44 1506 777 870\nOpen Every day\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\nThe main visitor attraction to livingston is it's shopping centres.

By 1970 most of the towns residential zones had been constructed. The first phase of Almondvale Shopping Centre was completed in 1976 to facilitate the needs of the local residents and workers. The first major refurbishment was completed in 1988 by Land Securities. During the refurbishment, the centre was extended by 230,000 sq. ft in 1996, creating phase 2 of the already very successful development, bringing the size of the centre to over 550,000 sq. ft.\n\nIn early 1999, construction started on phase 3 of the development with the construction of McArther Glen Designer Outlet Centre, (now renamed to Livingston Designer Outlet in 2007) and was opened three months behind schedule in October 2000, with other work continuing into 2001. During this time, ASDA Wal Mart constructed a new supercenter behind Almondvale Shopping Center. This supercenter is the largest of its kind in Europe. This brand new development opened up over 80 new shops, 20 bars and restaurants, a fitness Suite, 4000 new car parking spaces and an 8 screen 'Vue' cinema complex. In early 2007, another 15 shops were constructed within the centre replacing the \"At home\" area. Many businesses within this unit never re-opened in a new single unit.\n\nPhase 4 of the Almondvale development started in March 2007, which removed the Safeway supermarket and its car park. Also, between the Livingston Designer Outlet and Almondvale Centre, the car park was removed to make way for The Elements, a groundbreaking shopping center costing £135,000,000.\n\nThe Elements contains 35 brand new shops, with Marks & Spencer and Debenhams as anchor stores. Within this development, there are socialising areas, rooftop bars restaurants and a Winter Garden, bringing the Almondvale Centre Development to over a million sq. ft. The old Safeway carpark has been developed into a new 3 story car park providing another 1500 spaces.\n\nThe Elements opened on 16th October 2008, joining the Almondvale centre to become 'The Centre'. In June 2011 car parking charges were introduced for the first time, costing 50p for up to 2 hours then approx £1 per hour after that.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Italian Restaurants"]},"\n\nDa Vinci's Hotel\nHawk Brae, Ladywell West, Livingston, West Lothian EH54 6TW \n01506 460841\n\nRistorante Felicita\n1, Beveridge Square, Dedridge, Livingston, West Lothian EH54 6QF \n01506 429191\n\nLa Vita\n35b, Main St, Mid Calder, Livingston, West Lothian EH53 0AW \n01506 885138\n\nTony Macaroni Restaurant\nAlmondvale Crescent, Livingston, West Lothian EH54 7EP \n01506 410505\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Chinese Restaurants"]},"\n\nCathay Cuisine\n25, Main St, Deans, Livingston, West Lothian EH54 8BE \n01506 409988\n\nHong Chinese Restaurant & Take Away\n149a, Uphall Station Rd, Pumpherston, Livingston, West Lothian EH53 0PB \n01506 441832\n\nSapphire Restaurant\nUnits 2 & 3, Bankton Centre, Murieston, Livingston, West Lothian EH54 9DA \n01506 417272\n\nImperial Palace\n14, Marrfield Terrace, Uphall Station, Livingston, West Lothian EH54 5PY \n01506 438656\n\nChina Glen\nMcarthur Glen Designer Outlet, Almondvale Avenue, Livingston, West Lothian EH54 6QX \n01506 420011\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Indian Restaurants"]},"\n\nKhushis\n15, Bank St, Mid Calder, Livingston, West Lothian EH53 0AS \n01506 884514\n\nZaika Restaurant\n3, Follyburn Place, Livingston, West Lothian EH54 6BF \n01506 461561\n\nRaj Poot Restaurant\n90, Uphall Station Rd, Pumpherston, Livingston, West Lothian EH53 0LW \n01506 431166\n\nAshoka Shak\nUnit 26, Mcarthur Glen Designer Outlet, Almondvale Avenue, Livingston, West Lothian EH54 6QX \n01506 416622\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["American Restaurants"]},"\n\nFrankie & Benny's\nUnit 2, Almondvale South Retail Park, Livingston, West Lothian EH54 6XG \n01506 465420\n\nDa Vinci's Hotel - Brooklyn Bar\nHawk Brae, Ladywell West, Livingston, West Lothian EH54 6TW \n01506 460841\n\nChicargo Rock Cafe\nUnit 1, McAster Design Outlet Centre, Livingston, West Lothian, EH54 6QX\n01506 463123\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Fast Food"]},"\n\nSpud U Like Ltd\nDesigner Outlet Village, Almond Vale Bouleard, Livingston, West Lothian EH54 6QP \n01506 461446\n\nMacdonalds\n2 Almondvale Avenue, Livingston West Lothian.\nEH54 6QX\n01506 413200\n\nKFC\nAlmondvale Retail Pk Almondvale South \nLivingston, EH54 6RQ  \n01506 465473\n\nHarry Ramsdens\nUnit 5\/Almondvale Av, Livingston, \nEH54 6QX \n01506 400714\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Pubs"]},"\n\nThe Carvery\nBrucefield Industrial Estate, Rutherford Square, Livingston, West Lothian EH54 9BU \n01506 417788\n\nThe Granary\nAlmondvale Boulevard, Livingston, West Lothian EH54 6QN \n01506 410661\n\nBeefeater Restaurant & Pub\nDeer Park, Deer Park Avenue, Knightsridge, Livingston, West Lothian EH54 8AD \n01506 439202\n\nLivingston Inn\n2 Main St. Livingston Village\nWest Lothian EH54 7AF\n01506413054\n\nAlmond Bank - JD Wetherspoons\nAlmondvale Boulevard\nLivingston\nWest Lothian\n01506 424190\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Linwater Caravan Park"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.linwater.co.uk"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=West Clifton, East Calder, EH53 0HT.
