The city is the capital of Liège Province and most influential city in Wallonia. The language spoken is French. The knowledge of English among the population can vary and is generally better among young people.\nThe city has an important Italian community (5% of the population).\n\nLiège has been an important city since the early Middle Ages. It was the capital of the Principality (prince-bishopric) of Liège, which remained an independent state until the French Revolution (around 1789). In the 19th century it became an early centre of industrialism. The central area of Liège presents itself as a rather interesting mix of a historic town centre (dotted with a few extremely brutalist buildings from the 1960s and 70s), a rather elegant new town with wide boulevards, tall apartment buildings (some Art Deco) and a few pretty parks. The outskirts of Liège consist mainly of 2 very distinctive areas: large industrial complexes sprawling on the river's bank in the north and the south (with the cities of Seraing and Herstal) and working-class areas in the east and the west with mainly spare green neighborhood for healthy people.\nLiège is located just at the beginning of the Ardennes, which makes the landscape of the south very different than the rest of the city, with high hills and a lot of forest (Sart-tilman and beyond).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.liegeairport.com\/ Liège airport"]}]}," Specialising in freight (7th biggest cargo airport in Europe), the airport is nevertheless home to charter flights and a few regular lines, with routes to\/from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Agadir"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alicante"]]},",",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bodrum"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Catania"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Corfu"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Djerba"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Heraklion"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hurghada"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ibiza"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Izmir"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Las Palmas"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Malaga"]]},",  ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Monastir"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Palma de Mallorca"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pristina"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rhodes"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tel Aviv"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tenerife"]]},".
