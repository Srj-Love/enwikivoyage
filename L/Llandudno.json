Once a favourite of Queen Victoria, Llandudno still retains an old-world charm that sets it aside from other British seaside resorts.

It lies between two notable carboniferous headlands, the Great Orme and the Little Orme  with the Irish Sea on one side and the estuary of the River Conwy on the other with sunset views of Puffin Island. It is these headlands and the two waterfronts, the North Shore and the West Shore, that give Llandudno its special appeal.\n\nAlthough settlements have existed on the Great Orme since the Stone Age and an Iron Age hill fort survives at Pen-y-Dinas, Llandudno was developed as a seaside resort in the Victorian era. As such, it has Victorian charm - large Victorian houses, fine hotels lining the bay, a pier, boat trips round the headland, Punch and Judy on the wide promenade, an excellent lifeboat service, and a fine theatre with ballet, opera, orchestral concerts, ice shows and pantomime in season.\n\nLlandudno has a prominent Welsh speaking community, greatly increased by the frequent visitors from rural communities further inland whose primary day-to-day language is Welsh.\n\nAs a simple mnemonic for English speakers, in Welsh the double LL is pronounced as (thl). The U is usually pronounced as an I. So Llandudno is pronounced (thlan-did-no)",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.kc3.co.uk\/~bicycle\/sideways\/welsh.html"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Through trains from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London Euston"]]},", 6 times a day, change at Llandudno Junction"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Through trains from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Manchester"]]},", every hour on weekdays (2½ hours). "]},{"type":"*","value":[" Through trains from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Liverpool"]]}," (approx. 2-2½ hours), change at Chester or change at Chester ",{"type":"''","value":["and"]}," Llandudno Junction (it depends on the timetable how many changes there'll be)."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Trains from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Crewe (England)"],["Crewe"]]},", every hour on weekdays, change at Chester and\/or Llandudno Junction."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Trains from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cardiff"]]},", every two hours on weekdays, change at Llandudno Junction."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Trains from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Holyhead"]]},", every hour on weekdays, change at Llandudno Junction."]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nFrom ",{"type":"'''","value":["England"]},": From the M6, take the M56 in the direction of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chester"]]},", North Wales.
