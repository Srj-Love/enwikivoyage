Notoriously flat and largely rural, the Llano Estacado (also coloqially known as the South Plains) is famous for its wide-open prairielands and unmolested expanses that harken back to the days when Texas was largely unexplored frontier. Anchored in its center by the modern metropolis of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lubbock"]]},", the Llano Estacado offers a taste of what outsiders might perceive Texas as: rough, tough and unrefined, but a few cosmopolitan surprises lurk just beneath its dusty, forlorn surface. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lubbock"]]}," - Largest city in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Panhandle (Texas)"],["Texas Panhandle"]]},", home of Texas Tech University and birthplace of rock n' roll pioneer Buddy Holly."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Abernathy"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brownfield"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lamesa"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Plainview (Texas)"],["Plainview"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Post"]]}," - A utopian project community planned by cereal magnate C.W.

Aside from the dynamic hub of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lubbock"]]},", it is largely a cotton-producing region. The area is extraordinarily flat; travelers often experience miles of monotonous landscape flat as a tabletop and unbroken save for the occasional pumpjack or windmill. There is an abundance of cotton farms and the occasional cattle ranch, otherwise the South Plains remains largely unmolested and undeveloped grasslands. The people of the South Plains are generally laid-back, slow talking, slow to anger and quick to lend a hand. They are, however, also quick to defend their sense of identity and self-reliance. It is not advised to make light of what an outsider might perceive as \"quirkiness\".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nOutside of Lubbock, the South Plains is one of the places in Texas where the \"Texas Accent\" is still quite prevalent. An outsider or foreign traveler may have to ask a local to repeat themselves a time or two to understand what they are saying due to local dialect and slang, but generally they do not mind. It is not suggested, however, to kid them about it; to the people of the South Plains (like all Texans) the way they speak is a strong element of their sense of self and is a large part of who they are, and they are proud of it.\n\nSpanish is also spoken by a sizeable minority on the Llano Estacado, and while it would be unusual for an outsider to encounter a situation where nobody around speaks English, at least a rudimentary grasp of Spanish is certainly helpful.\n  \n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Air"]}," \nThe largest airport serving the Llano Estacado is the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.flylia.com\/ Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport"]},", a medium sized airport 5 mi (8 km) north of downtown that has daily flights to and from most of the major hub airports throughout the United States.

Though the Llano Estacado is predominantly rural, it benefits from Texas' exemplary state highway system and remains easily navigable. It is recommended, however, that you keep a close watch on the gas gauge as you travel the area because population centers are generally spread out over a wide distance, and not all of these towns possess gas stations.

The weather, however, does require some vigilance, as the region often experiences the widest weather extremes in the state. South Plains winters can be surprisingly brisk, and the areas at the far north end can receive significant snowfall during the winter months. Conversely, summertime high temperatures routinely top 100ºF (38ºC). Pack and dress accordingly. Also, during the spring months, dust storms are quite frequent and while these are not necessarily \"dangerous\", they can be frightening to those who have never experienced one.\n\nThe Llano Estacado is in ",{"type":"''","value":["Tornado Alley"]},".
