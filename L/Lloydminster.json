[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Lloydminster"]}," is a city straddling the border between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alberta"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saskatchewan"]]}," on Yellowhead Highway 16.  A geographic anomaly, it is one of only two settlements in Canada to operate a single municipal entity across two provinces. (The other, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Flin Flon"]]},", is a small Manitoba mining village with one tiny portion in Saskatchewan.) \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThe city was founded in 1903, at a time when modern-day Alberta and Saskatchewan were still part of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Northwest Territories"]]},". The provinces were created later with a boundary at 110Â° west longitude, right down 50th Avenue (Meridian Ave.). By 2011 the city had 27,800 people; principal local industries include agriculture and oil refining.\n\nDue to differing sales tax structures (Alberta has no provincial sales tax) and time zones (Alberta observes Mountain Daylight Savings Time seasonally, Saskatchewan keeps Central Standard Time year-round), Lloydminster and its immediate trading area are part of Alberta's time zone and its businesses follow Alberta's sales tax rules. A 163-bed hospital in Saskatchewan serves both provinces; the city's Lakeland College campus is in Alberta and the local airport (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["YLL"]]},") moved from Saskatchewan to Alberta in 1981.\n\nSaskatchewan addresses may be identified by their postal codes (which have a leading 'S') and telephone area codes (usually +1 306).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n;By car: Lloydminster is on ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yellowhead Highway"]]}," 16 at roughly the halfway point between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saskatoon"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Edmonton"]]},". The highway is divided for most of this route (except for the portion within Lloydminster itself). A second highway, Highway 17, runs north-south through the city, but is primarily only a local route.\n\n;By air: \n",{"type":"*","value":[" A ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.lloydminster.ca\/index.aspx?nid=114 local airport"]}," with one 1700m asphalt runway hosts ",{"type":"[","value":["https:\/\/flycma.com Central Mountain Air"]},"'s (+1-888-865-8585) weekday scheduled flights to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Calgary"]]},"."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Edmonton"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saskatoon"]]}," offer the closest international airports to Lloydminster."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Edmonton"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saskatoon"]]}," are both approximately 2.5-3 hours' distant on the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yellowhead Highway"]]},"."]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=Alberta Highway 16.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["image1a=Saskatchewan Highway 16.svg"],["imagesize1a=22"],["directionl1=W"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Edmonton"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vegreville"]]}],["directionr1=E"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saskatoon"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Battleford"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["53.278"],["-110.000"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Eastern Alberta"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Central Saskatchewan"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Lloydminster"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Lloydminster"]]}]
