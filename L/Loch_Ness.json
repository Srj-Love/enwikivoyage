The sightings claimed lend credence to the remote possibility of a group of survivors of the long-extinct plesiosaurs (which lived up to around 65 million years ago).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Regions "]},"\n\nThe Scottish Highlands consist of a plateau dissected by glacier scoured glens (valleys), many of them containing lochs (lakes). Loch Ness, the largest body of water in UK, lies in the geological fault known as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Glen Mor"]}," or ",{"type":"'''","value":["Great Glen"]},". The latter stretches for about 60 miles (97 km). The Caledonian Canal joins four lochs in the Great Glen – Dochfour, Ness, Oich and Lochy – and at each end connects to the sea. It connects to the North Sea at Inverness via the Moray Firth and the Atlantic Ocean at Corpach near Fort William. A series of lock gates in the canal helps to raise or lower ships.\n\nLoch Ness extends from Fort Augustus at one end to Lochend near Inverness at the other. It is 740 feet (226 metres) deep at its deepest point and is the second largest Scottish loch by surface area at 21.8 sq mi (56.4 km",{"type":"<","value":["sup",["2"]]},"). ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Loch Lomond"]]}," is larger with an area of 71 km",{"type":"<","value":["sup",["2"]]},". In fact Loch Ness is not the deepest loch either. Loch Morar plunges to over 1,000 ft. And it is not the longest Loch, that record goes to 34 mile Loch Awe. Loch Ness, however, owing to its steep-sided, flat-bottomed side-slip fault line origins is the largest volume of freshwater in the British Isles, containing more water than all the lakes, rivers and reservoirs of England and Wales combined ... room enough for a few mysteries. The ",{"type":"'''","value":["A82 road"]}," which runs along the western bank of Loch Ness offers stunning views of the loch all along the route. Rugged hills climb steeply from the loch’s dark waters. There are many parking places along the road where vehicles can be parked and the beauty of the surroundings savoured. There are some less used roads on the eastern side of the loch. A complete circuit of the loch covers about 70 miles (110 km). Driving on these roads can be challenging if you are not used to driving on the left. It may be better to take a tour along the loch or see it by boat.
