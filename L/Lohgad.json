It is very close to Lonavala, another famous Hill station. The place is actually a fort belonging to chhatrapati Shivaji maharaj. The fort is a part of three forts closely located near one another. Sadly though, the only existing structure is the remains of the Lohgad Fort.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Greenery at Lohagad Fort.jpg"],["thumb"],["350px"],["Greenery at Lohagad Fort"]]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nOne can take a private vehicle all the way to the base of the Fort, thanks to the newly constructed road. The nearest railway station is Lonavala.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["style"]]},"\nWe did plan a family trek to Lohgad on 26th July but the challenge was to walk all the way from Malvali station (the very next station from lonavala towards Pune by local) to Lohgad, a span of 8-9 km as the age group of joining members was ranging from 3 to 60. Even after lot of browsing we could not had any reference to locate a way by car till the basement. Fortunately we came across one reference who tried this just couple of weeks back and we decided to go ahead with his suggested route. It worked out and we can get our car to the base from where we were to just climb the stairs to reach the top. After this trip I can suggest two different routes to reach the base of Lohgad by car.\n\nFor people traveling from Mumbai or staying back in PCMC, the route is via Lonavala. \n\n''If starting from Pune take old Mumbai Pune highway. \nJust after you cross toll plaza before lonavala, keep your left till you cross “Manshakti” \nThere is a Y type left turn just after “Manshakti” \nTake that left and drive for another 200 odd meter to take very first left again \nYou are on way to lohgad after crossing the place called “Bhangarwadi” from where it is just 8-10 Kms. If you come across a railway crossing and Mumbai-Pune highway twice you are on right track. \nYou are on way to Paud, continue till you reach “Dudhiware Khind” \nJust before it, take left for Lohgad from here it is around 4 Kms max. \nThe road ahead is very stip with couple of sharp turns but safe.'' \n \n\nFor people traveling from Pune city, the route is via Chandani chowk – Pirangut - Paud \n''After reaching Paud take right and drive for around 40 odd Kms \nJust after you cross “Dudhiware Khind” you reach to the same place \nTake right for Lohgad base.'' \n \nIt is tar road and you can reach comfortably till the “Paytha”. Have a safe drive. It’s a wonderful place and should be tried in between mid August to mid Sept. when you can still have rain but the intensity comes down.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Lohgad darvaja.jpg"],["thumb"],["Fort Doorway"]]},"\nSince the place is located in the heart of maharashtra, knowledge of Marathi- the local language would be an added advantage. However, the locals also do understand Hindi.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nThe main attraction is the fort itself. Though its is approximately 3000feet abive sea level. The climb per se is not as difficult. It is advisable to have the best footwear as the mountains can really get very slippery during the monsoon.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nOf alll the sections of the fort, the main attraction is the point called \"vinchoo point\". This point resembles the look of a scorpion's tail.[In marathi- vinchooo means scorpion]. It is a little inaccesible and requires some effort to get to the end of it.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nThere is a lace where you get home food just at the base of the Fort. These are locals serving exclusive maharashtrian food at rates as cheap as Rs 40 per person- unlimited. Do not forget to savour their \"aamti\" and \"sheera\".\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Lohagad Fort7 by Bajirao Nawale.jpg"],["thumb"],["The part of the mountain looks like a scorpion's tail"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nIt is better to carry your own water.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nIf it rains very heavily, it is advisable not to climb too far up as various parts of the fort become extremely slippery and there are little gushes of water flowing from all ends, maing climbing even difficult.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Western Maharashtra"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["no Wikipedia link"]]}]
