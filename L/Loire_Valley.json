In choosing this area that includes the France Départements of Loiret, Loir-et-Cher, Indre-et-Loire and Maine-et-Loire, the committee said that the Loire Valley is: \"an exceptional cultural landscape, of great beauty, comprised of historic cities and villages, great architectural monuments - the Châteaux - and lands that have been cultivated and shaped by centuries of interaction between local populations and their physical environment, in particular the Loire itself.\"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe Loire Valley is two hours drive south of Paris, or one hour by train.\n\nYou can come directly to the heart of this region by plane from London or Dublin.

The still whites of the region from Amboise downriver to Saumur are distinctive, high-quality, fruity and well-rounded - from both small and large producers. The region also produces 'Method Traditionel' (champagne style) sparkling wines, which are a little more fruity and every-bit the equal of their expensive counterparts, but do not carry the premium of the appellation. \n\nThere are numerous co-operatives which operate within small appellations, as well as small independent producers, and large companies. Most producers have their own 'cave' (wine cellar, carved out of the local tufa rock) which offers tours and wine-tasting. Tasting is usually free, and there is no obligation to make a purchase. Small producers will often show you round their caves personnally.\n\nThere are many wine-festivals through the summer months - these are well worth the visit to make contact with producers - some of whom will send wine internationally. Try also the various 'route de vignobles' - designated tours around the vineyards, details are available in tourist information offices, from small villages to large towns.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nThe Lower part of the Loire valley covers two regions, the",{"type":"[[","value":[["Centre-Val de Loire"]]}," region, stretching from the fringes of Paris to the Auvergne,  studded with additional historical cities and chateaux at sites such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bourges"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saint-Benoît-du-Sault"]]},"; and the Pays de la Loire region, covering the lower reaches of the river, including cities such as Nantes and Angers.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["47.398889"],["0.702778"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["France"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Loire Valley"]]}]
