As such, the older generations may have a very limited knowledge of it. If you need help, find someone under 40-50 years of age.\n\nLolland is particularly close to Germany and sees many tourists streaming from there each summer via the Rødby-Puttgarden ferry link.

To get there you will have to go by bus, which is easiest from Nykøbing or Sakskøbing.\n\nIf you plan on going to some of the villages there is bus connections from Nakskov, Maribo, Sakskøbing and Nykøbing.\nIt is possible to get the most places by using these connections.
