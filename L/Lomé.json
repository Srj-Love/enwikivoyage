Taxis can be rented from around 500CFA and up, with 2000CFA getting you basically anywhere in town.  There are route taxis, costing normally 200-400CFA, but if you are visiting they are difficult to figure out and only ever really used by local folks.\n\nThere are rental car agencies downtown, but if you are just coming for a few days motos are your best option.\n\nThe beach road runs directly beside the ocean from Ghana to Benin.  The Boulevard Circulaire (le 13 Janvier) acts as a main artery through downtown Lomé, a hemisphere that encloses the Marche and Government buildings.

There are many western style dance clubs downtown.  Two of the best (and most expensive) are Privilege, attached to the hotel Palm Beach and 7Clash, in Dekon on the Boulevard.\n\nFor a more relaxed time, check out the beach close to the border with Ghana - seating is plentiful and, if you're lucky, the Castle Milk Stouts are pretty cold.  Be sure to get off of the beach soon after nightfall, as it is easily the most dangerous part of the city.\n\nLocal drinks can be found if you dig a little deeper.  The local brew of choice is Tchouk, locally brewed millet beer.  A calabash full at a tchouk-stand costs 100CFA in the city.  Other drinks are Deha - palm wine, and Sodabe - Togolese bathtub hooch - grain liquor that burns going down and coming back up.

Hotels are a dime a dozen the closer you get to the beach, the most expensive being the 2 Fevrier and Hotel Sarakawa, on the beach road. Amenities are very accommodating, but they are incredibly expensive for Lomé - 100,000+ CFA \/ night.\n\nThere are a few nice hotels with A\/C in Kodjoviakope and surrounding areas that will run you 7000 - 15000CFA. Check out The Galion, My Diana's, and for the budget traveller, ask for Mammy's, down the road from the Angolan Embassy (3500CFA per room, rooms fit 2-3).\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Hotel du 2 Fevrier"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address=Place De Independence Bp 131"],["lat=6.128469"],["long=1.214878"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["price="],["content=With its 36 floors this is Togo's tallest building, and is visible from anywhere in the city.
