After the end of Roman rule in 410 and a short-lived decline, London experienced a gradual revival under the Anglo-Saxons, as well as the Norsemen, and emerged as a great medieval trading city, and eventually replaced ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Winchester (England)"],["Winchester"]]}," as the royal capital of England.

With the rise of Britain to supreme maritime power in the 18th and 19th centuries and the possessor of the largest global empire, London became an imperial capital and drew people and influences from around the world to become, for many years, the largest city in the world.\n\nEngland's royal family has, over the centuries, added much to the London scene for today's traveller: the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London\/Mayfair-Marylebone#See"],["Albert Memorial"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London\/Westminster#See"],["Buckingham Palace"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London\/Notting Hill-North Kensington"],["Kensington Palace"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London\/South Kensington-Chelsea#See"],["Royal Albert Hall"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London\/City of London#Do"],["Tower of London"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London\/West"],["Kew Palace"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London\/Westminster#See"],["Westminster Abbey"]]}," being prominent examples.\n\nDespite the inevitable decline of the British Empire, and considerable suffering during World War II (when London was heavily bombed by the German Luftwaffe in the Blitz), the city is still a top-ranked world city: a global centre of culture, finance, and learning. Today London is easily the largest city in the United Kingdom, eight times larger than the second largest, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Birmingham (England)"],["Birmingham"]]},", and ten times larger than the third, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Glasgow"]]},", and dominates the economic, political and social life of the nation.

This had a dense population and all the other pre-requisites of a medieval city: walls, a castle (The Tower of London), a cathedral (St Pauls), a semi-independent City government, a port and a bridge across which all trade was routed so Londoners could make money (London Bridge).\n\nAbout an hour upstream (on foot or by boat) around a bend in the river was the government capital (",{"type":"[[","value":[["London\/Westminster"],["Westminster"]]},"). This had a church for crowning the monarch (Westminster Abbey) and palaces. As each palace was replaced by a larger one, the previous one was used for government, first the Palace of Westminster (better known as the Houses of Parliament), then Whitehall, then Buckingham Palace. The two were linked by a road called The \"Strand\", old English for riverbank.\n\nLondon grew both west and east. The land to the west of the City (part of the parish of Westminster) was prime farming land (",{"type":"[[","value":[["London\/Covent Garden"],["Covent Garden"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London\/Soho"],["Soho"]]}," for example) and made good building land.

Only one in three days on average will bring rain and often only for a short period. In some years, 2012 being an example, there was no rain for several weeks.\n\nWinter in London is mild compared to nearby continental European cities due to both the presence of the Gulf Stream and the urban heat effect. Average daily maximum is 8°C (46°F) in December and January. Daylight hours are short with darkness falling by 16:00 in December.\n\nSnow does occur, usually a few times a year but rarely heavy (a few years being exceptions such as the winters of 2009 and 2010, with temperatures dipping down to sub-zeros regularly). Snow in London can be crippling, as seen at the end of 2010. Just 7 cm (3 in) of snow will cause trains to stop running, airports to see significant delays, and the postal service to come to a halt.  London is a city which does not cope well with snow; walkways, stairs, and streets will not be cleared by shovels or ploughs.  The streets will be salted\/gritted, but will remain slick and snow\/slush covered until the sun melts it away. This is due to a lack of widespread snow-clearing infrastructure as the city does not often see snow.\n\nSummer is perhaps the best season for tourists as it has long daylight hours as well as mild temperatures. The average daily high temperatures in July and August are around 24°C (75°F). The highest temperature since 2000 was recorded once in August at 38°C (100°F). This means London can feel hot and humid for several days in the summer months.

However, if transiting through London, be sure to check the arrival and departure airports carefully as transfers across the city may be quite time consuming. In addition to London's five official airports (of which only two are located within Greater London), there are a number of other regional UK airports conveniently accessible from London.

It was also the first, with the oldest section of the Metropolitan Line dating back to 1863. The Tube is an easy method of transport even for new visitors to London.\n\nThe Tube is London's equivalent to subway and metro systems in other world cities.\n\nThe routes operated by the London Underground fall into 2 broad typesː the older 'sub-surface' lines, such as the Circle and District lines, date from the nineteenth century. The newer (a term used loosely here) 'deep level' routes, such as the Northern and Piccadilly lines, were largely constructed in the early- to mid- twentieth century. Each line has stations with interesting architectural and artistic features typical of the era they were opened. As you travel around the network, look out for Victorian finery, Edwardian glazed tiles, smooth Art Deco symmetry and striking modern masterpieces.\n\nAlthough not strictly part of the London Underground, the zonal fare system includes the Docklands Light Railway (or \"DLR\", a local transit system in the Docklands area using computer-operated \"driverless\" trains) and the Croydon Tramlink routes.\n\nIn addition to the Underground, there are routes termed 'London Overground' which are operated as part of the National Rail network, but on which certain Underground zonal fares can be used.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Ticketing "]},"\nTravel on the tube system will always require the purchase of a ticket or the use of an Oyster card if you have one; fare evasion is treated as a serious matter.\n\nPrices given are as of January 2014.\n\nSingle tickets are charged at two rates, depending on the payment method. Cash fares are zonal, Zones 1-2 being £4.70 between any two stations in those zones, a zone 1-6 single ticket is £5.70. Single Oyster fares are charged by the number of zones crossed, starting at £2.20 for 1 zone up to £5 for 6 zones. There are additional fares payable for zones beyond 6, but these are mostly outside what is considered London. Paper travelcards valid for 1 day, 3 days or 7 days are also available and can also be used on buses, National Rail trains, the DLR and Croydon Tramlink. They are priced by zones: a 1-day travelcard for Zones 1-2 costs £9 (Day anytime).  Under operator-specific schemes, registered students, seniors and the disabled can claim specific discounts by showing a suitable photocard having been obtained in advance of travel.\n\nAlmost all stations have automatic ticket barriers. If you pay by Oyster card, just tap your card against the yellow pad to open the barriers (both upon entrance and exit). If you have a paper ticket, insert it face-up into the slot on the front of the machine, and remove it from the top to enter the station. If you have a single-ticket it will be retained at the exit gate. If you have luggage or if your ticket is rejected there is normally a staffed gate as well. Paper tickets can be purchased from vending machines in the station lobby. There are two types of machine: the older machines that have buttons for different fare levels and accept only coins and the new touchscreen machines that have instructions in multiple languages, offer a greater choice of ticket and accept bills and credit\/debit cards (note that if your card has no embedded microchip, you cannot use these machines and you must pay at the ticket counter).\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Navigation "]},"\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/tfl.gov.uk\/tfl\/tube_map.shtml Tube maps"]}," are freely available from any station, most tourist offices and are prominently displayed in stations and in the back of most diaries. The Tube is made up of 11 lines each bearing a traditional name and a standard colour on the Tube map. To plan your trip on the Tube work out first which station is closest to your starting point and which is closest to your destination. You can change between lines at interchange stations (providing you stay within the zones shown on your ticket). Since the Tube Map is well designed it is very easy to work out how to get between any two stations, and since each station is clearly signed it is easy to work out when to exit your train. Visitors should be aware, however, that the Tube map is a diagram and not a scaled map, making it misleading for determining the relative distance between stations as it makes central stations appear further apart and somewhat out of place - the most distant reaches of the Metropolitan Line for example are almost 60 km (40 mi) from the centre of the city.\n\nIn central London, taking the Tube for just one stop can be a waste of time; Londoners joke about the tourists who use the Tube to travel between Leicester Square and Covent Garden stations, a journey which can take over 10 minutes on the Tube, despite the two stations being only a couple of minutes' walk apart. This is especially true since the walk from a tube station entrance to the platform at some central stations can be extensive. The Tube Map also gives no information on London's extensive bus and rail network.\n\nTrains run from around 05:30 to about 01:00. They are usually the fastest way to travel in London, the only problem being the relative expense, and that they can get extremely crowded during rush hours (07:30-10:00 and 16:30-19:00). On warm days take a bottle of water with you as there is no air conditioning in the stations and carriages. Also note that engineering works usually take place during weekends or the evening. ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/tfl.gov.uk Contact TfL"]},", especially if you plan to travel on a Saturday or a Sunday when entire lines may be shut down.\n\nAll lines are identified by name (e.g. Circle line, Central line, Piccadilly line). Many lines have multiple branches rather than running point-to-point so always check the train's destination (which is shown on the front of the train and the platform indicator screens, and will be broadcast on the train's PA). Some branches run as shuttles and require a transfer onto the 'main line'.\n\nNote that the Northern line has two separate routes through the city centre which split at Euston and rejoin at Kennington, one (officially called the Charing Cross Branch) runs through the West End serving Leicester Square, Charing Cross and Waterloo, while the other route runs via the City of London (officially called the Bank branch but also referred to as the City branch) with major stops at Kings Cross St Pancras and Bank. Despite the confusing layout of the line, it is fairly easy to work out which way your train is going; for example a northbound Northern Line train to Edgware along the Charing Cross branch will be displayed on the indicator as 'Edgware via ChX' and the on-board PA will announce \"This train terminates at Edgware via Charing Cross\".\n\nFinally, note that direction signs for the platforms indicate the geographical direction of the line, ",{"type":"''","value":["not"]}," the last stop of the line.

Owing to a heightened security climate, and a history of political violence targeting the tube, unattended baggage may be treated as a suspect or explosive device, and may be destroyed.\nLost items (if not destroyed) will end up at the LU Lost property Office (Tube: Baker Street).\n\nThe tube system is covered by an extensive CCTV system, although it is not advised to be reliant on this fact when travelling.\n\nThe London Underground considers its safety record to be a matter of professional honour, major accidents being incredibly rare.  Front-line staff are well trained for emergencies and will follow well rehearsed procedures. In addition front-line staff are generally appreciative of traveller vigilance, if concerns are politely expressed.\n\nAlthough there is no specific law barring casual photography, owing to the increased threat from political violence, some front-line staff can be nervous about the intent and nature of those undertaking it. Large scale or commercial photography requires a specific permit. Under no circumstances should direct photography of security critical equipment be taken, and before photographing front-line staff, it is advised to ask.

There are two types of night buses: 24 hour routes and N-prefixed routes.\n\n24-hour services keep the same number as during the day and will run exactly the same route, such as the number 88, for example. N-prefixed routes are generally very similar to their day-route, but may take a slightly different route or are extended to serve areas that are further out. For example, the 29 bus goes from Trafalgar Square to Wood Green during the day; however, the N29 bus goes from Trafalgar Square to Wood Green and then continues to Enfield.\n\nNight buses run at a 30 minute frequency at minimum, with many routes at much higher frequencies up to every 5 minutes.\n\nPrices stay the same, and daily travelcards are valid until 04:29 the day after they were issued, so can be used on night buses. Most bus stops will have night bus maps with all the buses to and from that local area on it, although it is good to check on the TfL website beforehand, which also has all those maps easily available.\n\nWhile Britons on public transport are normally a model of reserve, those using night buses have a bit of a reputation for loud and rowdy behaviour. This is mainly because passengers are often people who have been having a good time in central London's clubs and bars; particularly true on buses leaving central London between 01:00 and 03:00. While the buses are normally quite safe, if this is a concern for you, consider taking a pre-booked minicab instead, or failing that sit or stand on the lower deck of the buses nearer the driver.

As the trains operate automatically, it can be quite exciting - especially for children  - to sit at the front and look out through the window, whilst feeling as though one is driving the train oneself. The DLR also runs above ground on much of its route, and travels through many scenic parts of London, including the Docklands area where most of London's skyscrapers are located (which is how the network gets its name). Apart from the trains looking very different and running slightly less frequently than the Tube, visitors may as well treat the two systems as one system.\n\nUnlike on the Tube, most DLR stations do not have ticket gates (except for Bank and Stratford).  Also, unlike the Tube, you do need to push the buttons to open the doors. You can top up an Oyster card, buy a Travelcard or buy a paper ticket (at a substantial premium) from the ticket machines at the station. (Most stations are unstaffed, so if you want to pay by cash, make sure you have plenty of change!) As there are no gates, when travelling by Oyster you must always remember to touch in at the start, and out at the end of your journey. Even if you are changing to the Underground at Canary Wharf\/Heron Quays, you must still touch in\/out at the DLR station: the system will recognise that you have made an interchange between the two stations and treat it as part of the same journey.\n\nThe DLR can be a little confusing as the routes are not easily distinguished. Generally trains run on the following routes:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Bank - Canary Wharf - Greenwich - Lewisham;"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Stratford - Poplar - Canary Wharf - Greenwich - Lewisham;"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Bank - Poplar - Canning Town - London City Airport - Woolwich Arsenal;"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Tower Gateway - Poplar - Canning Town - Royal Victoria - Custom House (for ExCeL) - Beckton;"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Stratford International - Stratford - West Ham - Canning Town (then on to Beckton via Custom House, or on to Woolwich Arsenal via London City Airport)"]},"\nCheck the displays on the platform, which will show you the destination and the wait for the next three trains, and also check the destination displays on the front and side of the train and listen for announcements. At busy times, some trains do not run the full length of the route. Take the first train, listen for announcements, and change where necessary.\n\nBeware ",{"type":"'''","value":["Canning Town"]}," station as it is very busy, and the line divides into two sections - one heading to Woolwich Arsenal and the other heading to Beckton. The Woolwich Arsenal branch will take you to London City Airport and the Beckton branch will take you to Custom House for ExCel.

London's suburban rail services are operated by several private companies under tightly-written government contracts, and mostly run in the south of the city, away from the main tourist sights. Only one line (Thameslink) runs through central London - on a north-south axis between London Bridge or Blackfriars stations, and the underground level of St Pancras main line station. There is no one central station - instead, there are twelve mainline stations dotted around the edge of the central area, and most are connected by the Circle line (except Euston, Fenchurch St and those South of the river like Waterloo and London Bridge).\n\nMost visitors will not need to use National Rail services except for a few specific destinations such as Wimbledon, Hampton Court, Kew Gardens (Kew Bridge station), Windsor Castle, Greenwich, or the airports, or indeed if they are intending to visit other destinations in the UK. It's important to know that the quickest route between two stations is often a combination of the Tube as well as National Rail trains. For instance, if you are going from central London to Wimbledon, it will usually be much quicker to go to Waterloo and take the first Wimbledon train (around fifteen minutes, maximum) rather than take the District line, which can take up to 45 minutes.\n\nYour pay-as-you-go Oyster card is valid in London zones 1-6, but not beyond, so be careful—if you want to travel beyond, you will need to buy a paper ticket from the ticket office at the station. If you travel beyond the London zones with no valid ticket, you will be charged a Penalty Fare (on National Rail services this is usually £20), you will have to buy another ticket for the remainder of your journey, and you will also be charged the maximum Oyster fare because you didn't touch out. This adds up to a lot, so be careful and make sure you plan your journey! If in doubt, ask at the ticket office.\n\nThere are express trains to Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports. Tickets are often sold at a substantial premium, so you may want to consider taking the slightly slower 'stopping' services instead: for instance, an Anytime single from Victoria to Gatwick costs £19.90 on the Gatwick Express, and only £14.40 when marked \"Route Southern Only\"—taking a Southern train to Gatwick is only eight minutes longer. Don't forget: Oyster cards are ",{"type":"'''","value":["not valid"]}," to the main airports, except for London City Airport and to Heathrow when travelling by Tube.\n\nDon't throw your ticket away until you're out of the station at your destination! Many stations have ticket gates which you will need to put your ticket through to exit; also, you need to retain all the parts of your ticket throughout your journey, as a member of railway staff may need to see it.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Overground"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],[{"type":"'''","value":["Overground hints"]}],["* Beware of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["pickpockets"]]},".

These trains have plenty of seating and standing room, and big windows allowing for great \"urban scenic\" views.\n\nLondon Overground appears on the Tube map as an orange line. At many stations (Whitechapel, for instance) trains leaving from the same platform will go to different destinations, so listen carefully for announcements and always check the destination on the front of the train. The Overground can be a great way to avoid changing trains in central London by skirting around the centre. It's also well-connected: you can frequently change for Underground trains, other Overground destinations, or for mainline National Rail services from Stratford, Clapham Junction and Watford Junction.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By tram (Tramlink)"]},"\n\nTramlink, opened in 2000, is the first modern tram system to operate in London.

For an hourly charge, bicycles may be hired from automated hire stations around the city. The bikes, all coloured a distinctive bright blue, can be unlocked and ridden around the city with a credit card, and must be returned to another hire station by locking the bike into the rack.\n\nDespite recent improvements, London remains a relatively hostile environment for cyclists. The kind of contiguous cycle lane network found in many other European cities does not exist. The safest option is to stick to minor residential roads where traffic can be surprisingly calm outside rush hours.\n\nMost major roads in London will have a bus lane which is restricted to buses, taxis and bicycles.\n\nCycle-lanes exist in London with both on road and off road routes. The network is not comprehensive, and on the road lanes vary in quality (normally between one and two metres wide). Cycle superhighways (major cycle routes) are painted blue other cycle lanes are green or red; however, some are indicated just with an stencilled image of a bike on the road. If the line between the traffic lane is solid cars may not use it as it is a mandatory cycle lane. A dashed line indicates a recommended cycle lane and motorists may make use of this road space, but it is recommended they don't. Many improvements have been made for cyclists in the city over the last few years, Noticeably, there are many new signposted cycle routes and new cycle lanes as well as a review of junctions considered dangerous for cycling.  A new network of \"",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.tfl.gov.uk\/roadusers\/cycling\/11901.aspx Cycle super-highways"]},"\" has recently been launched: these are indicated by bright blue-painted tarmac. Motor vehicles often park on cycle lanes, rendering them unusable.\n\nNormally a cyclist should keep to the left of the lane when cycling on a road with traffic, to allow faster-moving traffic to overtake.  However, it is legal for a cycle to dominate a lane by maintaining a central road position like any other vehicle.  This will make you unpopular with any traffic behind you but it is recommended in London on approach to right-hand turns at junctions.  Making a right-hand turn from the normal left-position means crossing the lane of traffic, which may often ignore you and any turn signals you might have been using, leading to near misses and even collisions.\n\nThe towpaths in North London along the Grand Union Canal and Regent's Canal as well as in Londons parks and green ways provide traffic-free cycle path in the capital. The Grand Union canal connects Paddington to Camden and the Regent's Canal connects Camden to Islington, Mile End and Limehouse in East London. It takes about 30-40 min to cycle from Paddington station to Islington along the towpaths.\n\nCare should be taken lock your bike properly as many areas, some surprisingly busy, attract cycle thieves, while chaining a bicycle to a railing which appears to be private property can occasionally lead to said bike being removed.\n\nTaking bikes on trains is very limited in London due to overcrowding. Non-folding bikes can be taken only on limited sections of The Tube network, mostly only on the above-ground sections outside peak hours. For this reason, folding bicycles are becoming increasingly popular. There is a map showing this on the Transport for London website. Most ",{"type":"''","value":["National Rail"]}," operators allow bicycles outside peak hours also.\n\nCritical Mass London is a cycling advocacy group which meets for regular rides through central London at 18:00 on the last Friday of each month. Rides start from the southern end of Waterloo Bridge.\n\nThe ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/lcc.org.uk London Cycling Campaign"]}," is an advocacy group for London cyclists. With active local groups in most of the city's boroughs, it is recognised by local and regional government as the leading voice for cycling in the capital.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:A TX4 Taxi at Heathrow Airport Terminal 5.jpg"],["thumb"],["London Cab"]]},"\n\nLondon has two types of taxis: the famous ",{"type":"'''","value":["black cab"]},", and so-called ",{"type":"'''","value":["minicabs"]},". Black cabs are the only ones licensed to \"ply for hire\" (i.e. pick people up off the street), while minicabs are more accurately described as \"private hire vehicles\" and need to be pre-booked.\n\nThe famous ",{"type":"'''","value":["black cab"]}," of London (not always black!) can be hailed from the kerb or found at one of the many designated taxi ranks. It is possible to book black cabs by phone, for a fee, but if you are in central London it will usually be quicker to hail one from the street. Their amber TAXI light will be on if they are available. Drivers must pass a rigorous exam of central London's streets, known as 'The Knowledge', to be licensed to drive a black cab. This means they can supposedly navigate you to almost any London street without reference to a map. They are a cheap transport option if there are five passengers as they do not charge extras, and many view them as an essential experience for any visitor to London. Black cabs charge by distance and by the minute, are non-smoking, and have a minimum charge of £2.20. Tipping is not mandatory in either taxis or minicabs, despite some drivers' expectations - use your discretion. If you like the service you may tip. If the ride has been uncomfortable or unsafe, or if the driver was rude, don't. Most Londoners will simply round up to the nearest pound.\n\nTaxis are required by law to take you wherever you choose (within Greater London) if their TAXI light is on when you hail them. However some, especially older drivers, dislike leaving the centre of town, or going south of the River Thames. A good way to combat being left at the side of the curb is to open the back door, or even get into the cab, before stating your destination.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Minicabs"]}," are normal cars which are licensed hire vehicles that you need to book by phone or at a minicab office. They generally charge a fixed fare for a journey, best agreed before you get in the car. Minicabs are usually cheaper than black cabs, although this is not necessarily the case for short journeys. Licensed minicabs display a Transport For London (TFL) License - usually in the front window. One of the features of the license plate is a blue version of the famous London Transport \"roundel\". A list of licensed minicab operators can be found at ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.tfl.gov.uk\/tfl\/gettingaround\/taxiprivatehire\/default.aspx TfL Cabwise"]},".\n\nSome areas in London are poorly serviced by black cabs, particularly late at night. This has led to a large number of illegal minicabs operating - just opportunistic people, with a car, looking to make some fast money. Some of these operators can be fairly aggressive in their attempts to find customers, and it's now barely possible to walk late at night through any part of London with a modicum of nightlife without being approached. These illegal cars are also regularly unsafe: a number of women are assaulted every week by illegal minicab operators (11 per month) and there is also a risk of robbery. You should avoid minicabs touting for business off the street and either take a black cab, book a licensed minicab by telephone, or take a night bus. Always remember: ",{"type":"'''","value":["if it's not licensed and it's not pre-booked, it's just a stranger's car.

You can also use an app such as ",{"type":"[","value":["https:\/\/hailocab.com Hailo"]},", which allows you to summon a black cab to your location and will provide a map and approximate wait time for your taxi to arrive. Most railway stations will also be able to provide a list of good local cab firms (many will display this outside the station, even after the last train of the night has gone.)\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nLondoners who drive will normally take public transport in the centre; follow their example. Unless you have a disability, there is no good reason whatsoever to drive a car in central London.\n\nCar drivers should be aware that driving into central London on weekdays during daylight hours incurs a hefty charge, with very few exemptions (note that rental cars also attract the charge). Cameras and mobile units record and identify the number plates and registration details of all vehicles entering the charging zone with high accuracy. The ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/cclondon.com\/ Central London Congestion Charge"]}]}," M-F 07:00-18:00 (excluding public holidays) attracts a fee of £8 if paid the ",{"type":"'''","value":["same day"]},", or £10 if paid on the next charging day. Numerous payment options exist: by phone, on-line, at convenience stores displaying the red 'C' logo in the window and by voucher. Failure to pay the charge by midnight the next charging day (take note!) incurs a hefty automatic fine of £80 (£40 if paid within 2 weeks).\n\nDespite the Congestion Charge, London - like most major cities - continues to experience traffic snarls. These are, of course, worse on weekdays during peak commuting hours (i.e. between 07:30-09:30 and 16:00-19:00). At these times public transport (and especially the Tube) usually offers the best alternative for speed and reduced hassle. Driving in Central London is a slow, frustrating, expensive and often unnecessary activity. There are many sorts of automatic enforcement cameras and it is difficult (and expensive) to park. A good tip is, that outside advertised restriction hours, parking on a ",{"type":"''","value":["single"]}," yellow line is permissible. Parking on a red line or a ",{"type":"''","value":["double"]}," yellow line is never permissible and heavily enforced. Find and read the parking restrictions carefully! Parking during weekdays and on Saturday can also mean considerable expense in parking fees - fees and restrictions are ignored at your extreme financial peril - issuing fines, clamping and towing vehicles (without warning!) has become a veritable new industry for borough councils staffed by armies of traffic wardens.\n\nFor the disabled driving can be much more convenient than using public transport. If disabled and a resident of a member state of the EU then two cars can be permanently registered, for free, for the congestion charge.\n\nMotorcycles and scooters are fairly common in London as they can pass stationary cars, can usually be parked for free and are exempt from congestion-charging. Scooters and bikes with automatic transmission are much more preferable - a manually-geared racing bike is completely impractical unless you have excellent clutch-control (although it has to be said you will see plenty of them being ridden aggressively by motorcycle couriers and locals as it can be the fastest way to get around!) Likewise to bicycles, car-drivers can show disregard to anyone on two wheels and larger vehicles have an unwritten priority so take care when crossing junctions. Crash helmets are mandatory. Parking for bikes is usually free - there are designated motorcycle-parking areas on some side-streets and some multi-level parking lots will have bike parking on the ground level.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Tower Millennium Pier 2.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["A river bus at Tower Millennium Pier"]]},"\nLondon is now starting to follow the example of cities such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sydney#By ferry"],["Sydney"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bangkok#By boat"],["Bangkok"]]}," by promoting a network of river bus and pleasure cruise services along the River Thames.

These restaurants make much of their revenue on drinks although these are usually still moderately priced. The food while not being of the finest standard is usually very tasty and the range of dishes available is excellent.

Londoners wouldn't dream of eating here - you shouldn't either! Notorious areas for inflated menu prices trading on travellers' gullibility and lack of knowledge are the streets around the British Museum, Leicester Square and Piccadilly Circus.  Even the major fast food chains charge a premium in their West End outlets - so watch out.\n\nPubs in the touristy areas of London are usually a poor choice for food although there are some brilliant \"gastro-pubs\" hidden away - use the internet or a good guide (such as Time Out or Datemojo) to find them. In general avoid all pubs that have graphic-designed and printed menus - it's people's experiences in these kind of places that gives Britain a bad name for food! Look around you - see any locals tucking in? No? - then you shouldn't either. The other rule to follow when avoiding poor food is the same as in any other part of Europe - is the menu available in multiple languages?

All meals include the 20% VAT tax and some places include a service fee (10-12%). The general rule is to leave a tip for table service, unless there's already a service charge added or unless the service has been notably poor. The amount tipped is generally in the region of 10%, but if there's a figure between 10 - 15% which would leave the bill at a conveniently round total, many would consider it polite to tip this amount.

The average cost of hotel accommodation in London is higher than in any other major British city.  Prices invariably become inflated close to major sporting tournaments (such as the London Marathon, Wimbledon or major England football\/rugby  fixtures), or other important events taking place in the city - so it pays to plan your trip around such occasions or book your accommodation well in advance.\n\nIn general, most people tend to stay within \"Zone 1\" of the underground, however do your research carefully - sometimes being that extra five minutes away from a station can make the difference in cost and quality of local food and drinking options. In any case, you can always catch a bus anyway - by far the best way to see the city and get about generally.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Hotels"]},"\n\nYour budget will have a lot to do with what part of London you will want to stay in. Tourist-standard prices range from £20-200 per person per night. Expect smaller than average rooms especially at the low end of this range. As a general rule, expect to pay between £75-150 per night for a 2 or 3 star hotel in the central area of the city.  Many of the big name chain hotels now offer substantial discounts (with rates often down as low as £30-£50 per room per night) if you book well in advance, but the drawback is that you have to pay the full amount upfront at the time of booking and there are no refunds if you cancel.

Bear in mind though that this part of central London becomes a ghost town over the weekend, and you will find that few (if any) bars and restaurants will be open.\n\nA top tip however is to always check the likes of LondonTown.com, Expedia and LateRooms as well as the hotel's own website - since there are often deals to be had which can reduce the costs significantly.\n\nThe extra cost of getting around is probably not significant compared to savings made by staying in a hotel further out. With the excellent Tube system where you stay won't limit what you see. Always be sure though to check where the closest Tube station is to your hotel. Staying further out will be cheaper but when travelling in allow 1-2 min per Tube stop (near the centre), around 2-3 min per stop (further out) and 5-10 min per line changes. This can easily total up to a 1 hour journey if there is a walk at each end.\n\nA more imaginative alternative could be to stay in a nearby town with quick and easy train travel to London.
