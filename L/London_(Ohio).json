The General Assembly appointed a commission to choose a site for the seat of justice. They choose a 200 acre tract of land in Union Township belonging to a John Murfin. Lots were laid for a new town which the commissioners called London.\n\nFor the past 190 years London has served as the community hub for Madison County and continues to grow in a planned and directed manner. The 2000 U.S. census has the official population of London at 8, 771. The population for Madison County exceeds 40,000.\n\nAs people become more willing to commute long distances in exchange for a more rural lifestyle, London has grown considerably. Since 1980, the land size of London has increased over 70%.\n\nLondon's rich heritage and sense of history are evident in the newly completed Downtown Restoration\/Revitalization Project. Citizens, community leaders and consultants are working together to guide the development of new residential areas and expanded community services, while maintaining London's distinctive character.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Alexandra's Bed and Breakfast"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.alexandrasbb.com\/"],["email="],["address=117 North Main Street"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +1 740  852-5993"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=Historic central Ohio bed and breakfast offers rooms in the main inn and a Carraige House that can accommodate groups of 15-20.
