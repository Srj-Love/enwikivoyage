It is situated at the very southeastern edge of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Los Angeles County"]]},", bordering both the city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Los Angeles"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Orange County (California)"],["Orange County"]]},", in a region known as the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gateway Cities (Los Angeles County)"],["Gateway Cities"]]},".  \n\nLong Beach is recognized as one of the most culturally diverse cities in America. It has large percentages of Latinos and Whites (non-hispanic), as well as very sizeable percentages of Blacks (non-hispanic) and Asians. As a whole, the city tends to have a more East-Coast\/Midwest vibe when compared to the rest of the coastal California cities, so people from those regions of the country may find themselves a little more at home in Long Beach.\n\nYou may hear different people say different things about Long Beach; either wonderful or horrible things. This is because the city has quite a large population, with a density rate greater than that of nearby Los Angeles. Therefore, like other large cities, Long Beach encompasses everything, such as large industrial areas, struggling neighborhoods, quiet middle-class communities, and exclusive neighborhoods. \n\nLong Beach has some nice people-gathering amenities and genuine tourist attractions, such as a world-class aquarium and the Queen Mary floating museum\/hotel. Special events are also held in the city like the annual Long Beach Grand Prix (a premier racing event held on city streets) and the annual Long Beach Lesbian & Gay Pride event. When compared to other areas like Hollywood, West Hollywood, Santa Monica, and West L.A., Long Beach may not always be at the top of someone's tourist visit to the Los Angeles area, but the city draws its fair share of visitors and has proven it can definitely hold its own. \n\nThe area code for Long Beach is 562. For emergency services, dial 911 from any phone.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nOut of the five airports in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, Long Beach can easily be reached from three: Long Beach Airport (LGB), within the city itself; Los Angeles International (LAX), 22 miles away; and Santa Ana (SNA), 23 miles away. All three lie adjacent to Interstate 405. The other two airport options are Burbank (BUR), 37 miles away; and Ontario (ONT), 53 miles away. LGB will obviously be the most convenient to use location-wise and, being a smaller airport, provides less hassle; however, LAX may offer more frequent service, service from more destinations, and better fares.  Long Beach Airport is limited to 41 daily flights, 31 of which are provided by carrier JetBlue.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Long Beach Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["LGB"]]},") ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.longbeach.gov\/airport\/default.asp"]},": Rental cars are available for hire at the airport, which will most likely be needed in Southern California.

City bus Long Beach Transit Route 111 (Broadway\/Lakewood) connects the airport to downtown Long Beach and to the Blue Line at the downtown Transit Mall.

Look for the LAX Shuttle & Airline Connections sign on the Lower\/Arrival Level islands in front of each terminal, and board the free \"G\" Shuttle which takes you to the Aviation\/LAX Green Line Metro Rail Station. This is the closest station to the airport. Purchase a two-segment ticket from the automated kiosk ($2.50) for the two rapid transit lines you will ride. Take the Green Line train and exit at the Imperial\/Wilmington\/Rosa Parks Station. Then change levels and transfer to the Blue Line southbound to Long Beach. Overall travel time from LAX is about an hour and fifteen minutes or so during daytime hours. Daytime travel is fine, but it is not recommended to take the Blue Line late in the evening as the line traverses some very questionable neighborhoods. Two shared van services (Supershuttle or PrimeTime Shuttle) provide door to door service from LAX. Advise the representatives that you need a ride to Long Beach, and they will flag the appropriate van. Fare is approximately $28 one way, taking about one hour. A taxi from LAX to Long Beach is about $70.
