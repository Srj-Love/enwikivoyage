It can be visited as a day trip from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New York City"]]},", which is about 50 minutes away via the Long Island Rail Road; for those who prefer to stay longer, there are hotels near the beach. There are plenty of restaurants and bars in town, but for visitors, it's mostly really about the long sand beaches.\n\nThis small city was founded in the 1880s and started out as a vacation community where visitors crowded for some sea and surf. Through the 1940s, Long Beach was a glamorous resort town that attracted celebrities and other wealthy visitors, but a decline that began with the advent of affordable air travel led to the city developing a reputation for crime and decay by the 1970s. In the 21st century, however, Long Beach is once again a desirable destination. Long Island residents returned first, followed by Manhattanites looking for a quick, easy and affordable beach getaway, and now, for the first time in decades, hotels have begun to operate within the city limits.\n\nIn 2012 the area was devastated by Hurricane Sandy, with many homes and businesses flooded and the city's beloved boardwalk destroyed. Long Beach proved to have both the will and the resources to rebuild, and today the city is emerging even better than before the storm, with few obvious signs remaining of such a terrible event so recently in the past. In October 2013, just a year after Sandy, workers laid the last plank on the reconstructed boardwalk. Today homes are being repaired and rebuilt and shops, restaurants and bars continue to reopen; many new businesses, often catering to a younger, more-cosmopolitan clientele, are replacing those that unfortunately could not return.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]}," \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Long Beach (New York) bus leaving the railroad station.jpg"],["thumb"],["280px"],["Long Beach bus leaving the railroad station"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Twenty minutes from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["John F.
