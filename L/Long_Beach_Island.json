The Island derives its name from its white sand beaches that stretch the entirety of the 18 miles.  LBI was discovered in 1614 by Captain Cornelius Jacobsen May, a Dutch explorer and tradesman.  After discovery, the island evolved from important fishing hub to playground for well-to-do men and women.  During its history, the island was rattled by a few major hurricanes, including the largest in 1944.  A famous photograph of a home slowly falling victim to this hurricane is hung in many stores, restaurants, and hotels on the island today.\nNowadays, Long Beach Island's numerous tourists attractions and white sandy beaches make LBI a huge tourist spot.  The summer months are busiest, \"the season\" ranging from mid-May through Chowda Fest in October.  The majority of the island shuts down during the winter months.  Although evolved from the 1950s days of full-coverage bathingsuits, LBI is certainly still a playground of sorts.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\nHistorically, it was possible to get to Long Beach Island  by train, bus, or car.
