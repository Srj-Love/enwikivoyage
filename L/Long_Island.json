One of the most celebrated local beers is called Blue Point ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.bluepointbrewing.com\/"]},", named for the town of the same name.\n\nDrinking on Long Island is tough because you need a car to get around, with this in mind, use the Long Island Railroad to your advantage. Take it from town to town, or take a night out to go into the City. At night, there is little public transportation besides LIRR, but there are taxis. The South Shore in Nassau County has some good bars, (with a somewhat rowdy crowd, however). \n\nOn the North Shore you will find a buzzing college-bar scene year-round, mostly for those college students and other 20-somethings looking for a night out that doesn't involve a dorm party, frat or sorority or an expensive trip to NYC. The most popular towns for this kind of bar-scene are Huntington Village, Port Jefferson, (both along Route 25-A) and recently Smithtown along Jericho Turnpike\/Route 25, which has developed as an up-and-coming bar scene by night despite their charming shopping and family-oriented atmospheres by day. \n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Montauk"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fire Island"]]},", which are very much touristy beach towns, are home to many barsâ€”what else is there to do on a warm summer's night?!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nBe smart, don't travel to towns with a lot of crime at night. These towns include: Roosevelt, Hempstead, North Amityville, North Baldwin, Wyandanch, Rosedale, North Bay Shore, Central Islip, New Cassel, Brentwood, Uniondale and northern Freeport. In the daytime, these areas are generally safe. \n\nOther than those towns, which most locals could tell you is where most of the  dangerous crime occurs, crime on the rest of Long Island is related to drug-arrests and burglarlies of high-end neighborhoods.\nMost robberies are related to hired help, and are low-profile crimes. However, the most recent epidemic crime problem has been the increase in heroin use among Long Island teens, particularly of wealthier neighborhoods along the North Shore. Generally, this should not be a problem for a tourist.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["The daily, Island-wide newspaper is ",{"type":"''","value":["Newsday"]},", which also provides a detailed history of the island.

It is very common for Long Islanders to never leave the Island during summer vacations because there is so much to do in the summer even for locals. The Island itself is large, and one can live on Long Island their entire life and still find something new to do or explore on the very same island each summer. On Long Island, there is not too much in the way of manufactured fun. It is all about exploring the communities and natural scenery for what they are to year-round residents.
