There is a saying in Longzhou, \"We have an embassy, but no ambassador. A train station, but no trains. And an airport with no planes.\"\n\nDuring the late 1800s as French influence grew in Vietnam they tried to expand into Guangxi province. In Longzhou they set up the first Embassy in Guangxi. Wars were fought along the little great wall to prevent further influence.\n\nIn the early 1900s the Guomindang (Chinese Nationalists) built up their influence in this important river port, they even built an airport to help them keep control of the city.  In the 1950s and 60s Ho Chi Minh had a small house in Longzhou where he would be able to meet with Chinese leaders.\n\nIn 1979 Deng Xiaoping tried to launch a Communist rebellion from Longzhou. Ultimately it failed, and Deng tried again in Baise, where he launched his most famous rebellion. There is a small building where Deng Xiaoping stayed while in Longzhou. \n\nWith the development of the Nanyou expressway, Longzhou has been cut out of the main Vietnam-China traderoute and has returned to its backwater status.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nLongzhou has a bus service from the provincial capital of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nanning"]]}," and the journey takes just over 2.5 hours.
