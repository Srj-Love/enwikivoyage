There is no evidence of any human habitation of the island prior to this.  The island soon became a supply point on trips to Norfolk Island, as well as a base for whaling.\n\nThe lagoon of the island was used until 1974 as a stopover point for flying boats to America and New Zealand, as well as to bring visitors to the island.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Geography"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:LordHoweIsland MtGower 408.JPG"],["thumb"],["right"],["Sheer volcanic cliffs, and lagoons"]]},"\nLord Howe Island is crescent-shaped, 10 km long and 1.5 km wide at its greatest width. The island forms the top of an extinct underwater volcano and seamount, projecting above the surface of the ocean. The eastern facing crescent of the island, together with a reef, forms a lagoon on the eastern side of the island. The water here is generally calm. On the western side of the island there are several sandy surf beaches.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["People"]},"\nThe population of Lord Howe Island is approximately 350 people. Only 400 tourists are permitted to visit the island at any one time. Unlike on an island resort, the people who are providing services to you are likely to be residents of the island. Some families have lived there for generations. The people have a genuine affection for the island, and knowledge of the best spots to snorkel, walk, and picnic. The non-existent mobile phone network is substituted by a people network, with messages passing between locals and tourists when they encounter each other around the island. If you are seeking genuine warmth rather than the superficial niceties, the people of Lord Howe won't disappoint.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Lord Howe Island - Qantas arriving.JPG"],["thumb"],["left"],["The daily Qantas flight arrives from Sydney"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nLord Howe Island is approximately 2 hours direct flying time with QantasLink from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sydney"]]}," (daily), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brisbane"]]}," (weekends) and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Port Macquarie"]]}," (weekly, seasonal).
