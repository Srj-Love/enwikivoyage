Rugged coastlines and many beaches and surf breaks make the trip itself just as enjoyable as the destination, but holiday makers fill the town to bursting every summer. Originally a logging town, Lorne's crystal clear waters and amazing views make it a great place to stop despite the increasing gentrification and development of what was once a quaint town.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Teddy's Lookout"]},".
