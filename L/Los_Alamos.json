The biggest lawbreaking threat to life and limb is drunk drivers.  Northern New Mexico has an unfortunate and well-deserved reputation for DUI problems.  Until recently Los Alamos was an exception to this, but not any more.  Be alert when driving on the arterial roads after 10PM or so, particularly on Friday and Saturday nights.  Another driving hazard is wildlife, particularly deer and elk.  Mule deer can be seen around town all year long, day and night.  Herds of elk come down from the Jemez Mountains during the winter and often congregate around the roads.  If your car hits an elk at highway speed, the elk may lose, but you will most assuredly not win.  Again, be careful driving after sundown during the winter months.\n\nBelieve it or not, one of the most important types of fatal accident sustained by townspeople is falling off a cliff—sometimes a cliff literally in the victim's back yard.

Or, take the \"high road\" to Taos through a series of tiny Colonial Spanish mountain villages."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" If traveling to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Albuquerque"]]}," on the way home from Los Alamos, consider forsaking the highway route (NM 502 to US 84\/285 to I-25) in favor of the \"back road\" through the Jemez Mountains.  Take NM 501 west out of Los Alamos and proceed past the Camp May road to a T intersection with NM 4.  Left leads back to Bandelier; instead turn right, climbing steeply and spectacularly into the mountains and through Valle Grande, the largest grass meadow of the Valles Caldera.  On emerging on the west side of the mountains, NM 4 connects with NM 44 (US highway 550) which leads back to the interstate close to Albuquerque.  This takes up to half an hour longer than the highway route but is worth it for the mountain scenery.  Be wary of radar traps, and skip it in winter after a snowstorm, as the road through the mountains may be temporarily impassable."]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["35.891111"],["-106.297778"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Jemez Mountains"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["guidecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Los Alamos, New Mexico"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Los Alamos, New Mexico"]]}]
