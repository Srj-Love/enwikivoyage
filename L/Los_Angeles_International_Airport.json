Most were built before the Transportation Security Administration implemented modern security checkpoints, which means the checkpoints were shoehorned into the existing buildings with very awkward results. \n\nIf you find yourself in one of the older terminals, keep in mind that the last comprehensive renovation and expansion of LAX was just prior to the 1984 Summer Olympics.
