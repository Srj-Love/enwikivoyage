This area of over 4000 square kilometers in Argentine Patagonia is complete with mountains, glaciers, lakes, wildlife and arctic views. The giant ice cap in Los Glaciares National Park feeds over 40 glaciers, the largest outside of Antarctica and Greenland. One third of the park is covered by ice that can tower up to 1500 meters in the air.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nLake Argentino, in the south, is the largest in the whole country, and as such dominates this region of Patagonia. Many tourists begin their journey in the town of El Calafate, which is on the shore of the lake. Excursions leave from here by land to the Perito Moreno Glacier. Other excursions venture by boat between the icebergs to many other glaciers, since a majority of them can only be seen by boat. \n\nLake Viedma, in the north, is home to the Viedma Glacier and Mount Fitz Roy. The village of El Chalten, at the foot of the Fitz Roy Massif, is another starting point into the park (and lacks the 100 peso entrance fee present at the Perito Moreno entrance). This is the most popular spot in the region for those who love to climb and trek with its numerous trails. Although most of these are effectively day trails, there are possibilities for staying overnight in a number of campsites. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nLos Glaciares National Park can be divided into two different entrances, one near the Lake Argentino and the other near Lake Viedma.
