The bay is unexceptionally beautiful as well as historic.  The presence of 3 important Spanish forts dating from the 1600´s are restored and well maintained.  The Spanish lost the forts to the Chilean revolutionary forces without firing a single cannon.  Hired by the Chileans Lord Cochrane led his ships into the bay area only to realize that the forts were invulnerable (except for one element.)  Cochrane took his ships further down the coast and disembarked the men.  Realizing the major fort of Corral had no rear wall protection from infantry, the naval commander organized his sailors into ground troops attacking the fort from the rear and easily took the fort.  \nValdivia is likewise the site of the world´s worst recorded earthquake which occurred on May 20, 1960. A resulting tsunami took even more lives as the giant wave came in at an estimated 42 feet high, likewise causing destruction and death in Hawaii and Japan.\nThe city has excellent hotels, restaurants and a casino.  Close to the city are national forests and wonderful ocean beaches.  Boat tours are quite popular as well are boat and jet ski rentals.  \nFurther inland are several lakes with options such as fishing, bed and breakfasts, hostels, hotels, camping and during the summer many local folklore festivals.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Southern Chile"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Los Ríos Region"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["-39.808333"],["-73.241667"]]}]
