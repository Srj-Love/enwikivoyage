Now, however, the largest employer is Loughborough University, this has a dramatic impact on the town. The 14,000 students account for around one in four of the town's population. This gives the town a younger profile than you might expect in term time but makes the place relatively quiet during the summer.\n\nThe university has a 437 ac campus on the mostly residential western side of the town. The campus occupies a band running west from the ring road to the edge of town, splitting the northern estates from the Forest Side in the south-west. The eastern side of the town, close to the canal and the railway lines is generally older, includes the town centre and contains more of the town's industry and industrial heritage.\n\nIn recent years, the university has sought to promote itself as a centre of excellence for sport. It now hosts facilities for a number of national associations including the headquarters of the Amateur Swimming Association and the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB)'s National Cricket Performance Centre. Loughborough will provide the main camp for 'Team GB' in the run up to the 2012 London Olympics and the university's facilities will be also be used by the Japanese Olympic team.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\nEast Midlands Airport is 7 miles northwest of Loughborough. \nThe town is well-connected to the airport by the Skylink bus service,  a more direct link than via East Midlands Parkway railway station.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nLoughborough is served by East Midland Trains travelling from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sheffield"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nottingham"]]}," and by Cross Country Trains to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nottingham"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Derby"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Leicester"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lincoln"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Birmingham (England)"],["Birmingham"]]},".\nLoughborough's railway station is approx 1 mile north-east of the town centre.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By road"]},"\nLoughborough sits on the main A6 road between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Leicester"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Derby"]]}," and adjacent to the M1 motorway (at junction 23).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bicycle"]},"\nLoughborough is on National Cycle Route 6.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By water"]},"\nThe refurbished Loughborough Wharf at the northern edge of the town centre links to the Grand Union Canal.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nThe main bus services within the town are provided by Kinchbus.

It's the work of Glaswegian artist Shona Kinloch and commemorates the once thriving hosiery industry within the town.\n\nThe Carillon ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Carillon"]}," Tower (universally mispronounced ca-ri-li-on) in Queen's Park is the town's war memorial and the outstanding landmark.

Recitals are given on Thursdays lunchtimes and Sundays afternoons through the summer.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Great Central Railway"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.gcrailway.co.uk"],["email=sales@gcrailway.co.uk"],["address=Loughborough, LE11 1RW"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+44 1509 632323"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=A preserved steam mainline railway running on the old Great Central from Loughborough to Leicester North."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" John Taylor Bellfoundry Museum - collection of the world's largest working bell foundry.
