Louisville is also the namesake of the Official Bat of Major League Baseball - the Louisville Slugger.\n\nThere are many correct pronunciations of \"Louisville,\" from ",{"type":"''","value":["LOOey-vil"]}," to ",{"type":"''","value":["LOOuh-vuhl"]}," to ",{"type":"''","value":["LU-vul"]},", but pronouncing it like \"Lewisville\" is generally considered incorrect.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nA major city located on the Ohio River in North Central Kentucky across from Southern Indiana, Louisville exists at the confluence of Southern and Midwestern attitudes and cultures. Known historically as the 'Gateway to the South', Louisville has long been a transportation center for the region. Other local nicknames include 'River City' and 'Derby City', in addition to the myriad of ways the name can be pronounced, depending on one's accent. More or less any pronunciation is acceptable except 'Lewis', an error which will not offend anyone but definitely marks one as an out-of-towner. While it only borders on the region, tourists will probably find a bit of the famous Southern hospitality here, along with its varied cuisine and a relaxed attitude toward life. The city also boasts a vibrant arts and music scene and a world-class municipal parks system.\n\nLouisville's biggest draw are the horse races at Churchill Downs (with the famous Kentucky Derby always the first Saturday in May), but the city is making a concerted effort to draw tourists year round. The architecture in Old Louisville and the Highlands is one-of-a-kind, and the people are very friendly.\n\nThe Downtown, Old Louisville, Highlands, and Frankfort Avenue areas are walkable and it is possible to take the city bus between one or all four without much difficulty, with a downtown hotel as base. Outside of this part of town though, you will almost certainly need a car.\n\nAside from Downtown, a must-see for many is the Highlands shopping district, on Bardstown Road roughly from Broadway to the Douglass Loop. Often described as \"bohemian\", it includes art galleries, bars, coffeehouses, midrange to upscale restaurants, and is ideally navigated by foot or bike. You can meet some locals on the sidewalks without much trouble, if you are interested.

Tickets can be purchased at some banks and government offices but this will not really save you much money unless you are going to be staying in the city and getting around by bus for at least two weeks. Buses generally run from about 6AM-10PM, some later on weekends, but it is a good idea to check the schedule for each specific route. Timetables are only posted at major stops. The buses are also rather impractical in the suburbs, as they are infrequent and the stops are far apart.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nCar rental services are available at the airport.

Frequently, the streets are named after outlying towns they eventually reach (Shelbyville Road, Bardstown Road, Taylorsville Road, etc.) Some of the urban neighborhoods, notably Germantown, Portland, and the neighborhoods surrounding Cherokee Park, can be confusing for non-locals. Fortunately most neighborhoods are quite safe and passers-by will be more than happy to give you directions.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bike"]},"\nBicycling is becoming an increasingly effective way to get around Louisville.  Although Louisville's bike program ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.louisvilleky.gov\/bikelouisville"]}," is in its infancy (born at the 2005 Louisville Bike Summit), developments are occuring rapidly, and there are significant improvements on the immediate horizon.  In fact, former long-time mayor and current Kentucky lieutenant governor Jerry Abramson is an active cyclist.  Bike lanes are being added on city streets, especially in and around Downtown which is already the most bike-friendly area of the city.\n\nEvery TARC bus in the city is equipped with bike racks, making bicycling a viable option for long-distance trips and trips along major arterial corridors.  If you plan your transit route in advance, it is easy to get anywhere in the city using just your bicycle and public transit.  Metro Government is also installing more bike racks every day, making it easy to park your bike at your destination.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Outside"]},"\nLouisville's park system was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, the \"Father of American Landscape Architecture.\" Many consider it to be his greatest achievement. Cherokee Park, Iroquois Park, and Shawnee Park are the Flagship Parks, while more than a dozen smaller parks make up Louisville's own \"Emerald Necklace.\" Cherokee Park features a 2.3 mi (3.7 km) 'Scenic Loop' with one lane of traffic reserved entirely for cyclists, pedestrians, and other recreational activities. Iroquois Park contains what was the tallest hill in Louisville before the city merged with surrounding Jefferson County in 2003; the hill's location gives it a commanding view of downtown, especially on clear days. In addition to the major parks, dozens of smaller ones are spread throughout the city, such as Tyler Park in the Highlands, a favorite of locals, or George Rogers Clark Park in Germantown.\n\nA newer addition, Waterfront Park, is arguably one of the greatest things the city has done to improve its image in a decade. Stretching along over a mile of the Ohio River, Waterfront Park offers playgrounds, artistic landscaping, fountains, and open lawns, all with spectacular views of the city skyline and the river. It frequently plays host to concerts and other festivals. The third phase of the park's construction is still in progress, and, when completed,  will include a pedestrian walkway crossing the Ohio River via the abandoned Big Four Railroad Bridge to Jeffersonville, Indiana. The bridge opened on the Kentucky side in 2013; after a year-long delay, the Indiana access ramp opened in May 2014.\n\nEnjoy the view (day or night) of downtown Louisville from Ashland Park, on the Ohio River in neighboring Clarksville, IN. Park the car and walk across the street to Widow's Walk, an ice-cream parlor\/garden statue shop constructed to look like an old Victorian mansion.

Just south of downtown, it is the third largest National Preservation District in the country and the largest Victorian district in the United States.

Faced with possible demolition in the 1970's, the area is now considered to be one of Louisville's best-kept secrets. A good way to see the neighborhood is to follow a walking tour ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.oldlouisville.com\/walking_tours_of_old_louisville.htm"]},". It also has a number of locally-beloved bars and restaurants, and a heterogeneous population that gives the neighborhood a particularly eclectic feel.\n\nMain and Market streets downtown contain the second largest collection of 1800's era iron facade buildings in the United States.

If you're going to pay more for a hotel, you might as well get character as well. There are also some Bed and Breakfasts in Old Louisville, if you'd like to stay in a 120+ year old Victorian mansion, here's your chance.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nMost of Louisville is pretty safe (for a city its size, it has never been featured on the TV show \"Cops\"). Probably the least safe areas are west of Ninth Street (the Greyhound bus station is unfortunately located here). Professional scammers acting as panhandlers are common at the station, and while not terribly aggressive or rude, they are persistent. Pickpockets are also a problem, as they will often snatch belongings from the side pockets of any bags or purses you may have.\n\nIn addition, several attempted muggings have occurred directly outside of the terminal, (with station security being shockingly apathetic and unhelpful in these situations, at least until the Metro Police arrive) so be very cautious. However, a daytime drive through this part of town along Portland and then Northwestern Parkway is very interesting and not dangerous at all. Areas around Churchill Downs are also relatively sketchy, but again, simply driving through in the daytime is not a risk.\n\nThe crime risk is lower east of the Highlands. Within the Highlands, crime is still low, but use caution exiting bars on Baxter Avenue if you are alone. This same advice applies to Old Louisville, only more so. Other than this, just use common sense like you would anywhere else.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Newspapers"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Courier-Journal"]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.courier-journal.com"]},".
