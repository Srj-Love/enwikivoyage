[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Lourdes banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Lourdes"]}," is a large town in the French ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Midi-Pyrenees"],["Pyrenees"]]},". It is a global centre of Marian pilgrimage, receiving hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. Catholics believe that the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God, appeared 18 times at the Grotto to a young girl, St Bernadette Soubirous.\n\nOriginally a sleepy market town on the road to the spas of the Pyrenees, Lourdes has grown into the largest Marian pilgrimage centre in the world. The town has two sections: the international portion by the river, consisting of the spiritual area containing the Grotto and churches (known as the Domaine or the Sanctuaries), and the \"French\" portion, centered around the Marketplace & Hotel de Ville.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\n\nThere are several trains and buses connecting Lourdes to other French cities.

Lourdes is easily accessed by car, although the narrow streets around the holy sites can become quite congested at weekends and holy days. Roads from the South-West of France and from Spain are also good.

The small SNCF station offers minimal services, but there are free toilets, a small coffee\/pastry counter, vending machines, and an adjacent cafe and quick service restaurant (service can be rather surly, even for France).  Accessibility is excellent due to the large number of infirm and disabled pilgrims who visit Lourdes and many trains passing through Lourdes offer special services for the disabled.  \n\nNight trains from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tours"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Paris"]]}," are available; however, these can be quite uncomfortable as they feature standard, non-reclining seats rather than berths or beds, and lights remain on throughout the trip.  However, travel in first class allows for a T4 compartment (2 bunkbeds).  Lourdes is a stop rather than the terminus, so know what time you are supposed to arrive and listen for the announcement for Lourdes (there will probably be many others going to Lourdes, especially the elderly or infirm, so you can watch rather than try to decipher the often-unintelligible PA announcements).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By coach "]},"\n\nCoach arrivals from the UK and Ireland into Lourdes are charters, run by specific travel agencies for organised Pilgrim groups.\n\nThe main organisation is ",{"type":"'''","value":["ACROSS"]}," who travel weekly by special coaches designed for the purpose. www.across-uk.org\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Across"]}," cover the whole of the UK and can also arrange pick up locally.

Medical care is available for the duration of the trip provided full disclosure is given to Across in advance of the trip. Costs are fully inclusive on a full board basis. Importantly for disabled the Insurance is also included in the cost. Trips for disabled to other destinations can also be arranged. ACROSS is a registered charity.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By plane "]},"\n\nThe nearest airport is ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.tlp.aeroport.fr\/en\/traveller\/ Tarbes-Lourdes"]}]},", approximately twenty minutes' drive from the town itself.

Attend mass (dozens on offer in almost every language in the world) somewhere in or around the holy sites. Visit one of the many Bernadette attractions (several museums, her former home, etc.) and best of all: watch the astonishing numbers of pilgrims from all over the world. The Underground Basilica of St. Pius X, a church constructed entirely underground, is especially interesting architecturally.\n\nEspecially interesting is the International Mass, held in six languages (English, French, Italian, Spanish, German, and Dutch) simultaneously in the Underground Basilica of St. Pius X Sunday mornings.  Arrive early to get a seat.  One wonderful experience is to arrive about 1 1\/2 hours early to be part of the choir (open to anyone who arrives early to rehearse).  You get to sing with people of all 6 languages and have an excellent view of the Mass.  \n\nDon't miss the nightly candlelight procession (buy your candle beforehand from one of the souvenir shops) in front of the Basilica and around the main square, with singing, prayer and a rosary said in many languages (alternating half-decades in English, French, Italian, etc.).  The procession of the sick to the Underground Basilica each afternoon is particularly moving, as well.  Other religious activities available include confession (available in French, English, Spanish, Italian, German, Dutch), adoration, stations of the cross (in the underground basilica), candle lighting near the Grotto, and rosary in front of the Grotto each afternoon (in French) and at other times\/places in other languages.\n\nIf you have a car, spend a day in the wonderful Pyrenees.
