",{"type":"'''","value":["Kalibukuk"]}," is the main hub of this area and is often thought of as the \"Lovina town centre\".\n\nThe whole stretch of coast here is fringed by narrow black sand beaches, which are accessed by a multitude of small lanes which run perpendicular to the east-west coast road. The beaches are generally safe for swimming, and the waters of Bali's north coast, in direct contrast to the crashing surf of the south, are relatively calm.\n\nDiving, snorkelling and dolphin watching are the main activities, but perhaps above all else, this is an area in which to relax and take in a very slow, traditional pace of life. It can get a little crowded in July and August, outside that peak season, this is a quiet part of the island.\n\nLovina also has a large number of ",{"type":"''","value":["cafés"]},".
