A credit or debit card is a very good idea for booking tickets. Most low-cost airlines sell their tickets as single journeys only.\n\nThe pricing structure is complex, with fares fluctuating strongly according to demand, often on an hourly basis, and the same rule \"get as much money as a traveler is ready to pay\" that was invented by traditional carriers applies.

Their website allows you to book multiple flights simultaneously however, and even allows you to exchange a flight you have purchased for a different flight of your choice on their website providing a partial refund (e.g. changing to a flight on a different date and\/or with different passenger names). If you change planes at an Easyjet hub you must collect your luggage and check it in again at the hub. You can book a return at the same time as the outbound but you get no discount for doing so. Some of the advanced features on the Easyjet website are only available if you create an account for yourself on the website.\n\nFollowing Ryanair, easyJet has no free weight allowance for luggage, and charge for all checked luggage.  However, they do not charge extra for printing a boarding pass at the airport. \n\nEasyJet has hubs in 3 ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]}," airports (Gatwick, Stansted, Luton) as well as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Basel"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Berlin"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bristol"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Madrid"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dortmund"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Edinburgh"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Geneva"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Paris"]]}," (CDG and Orly), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Liverpool"]]}," and various other ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United Kingdom"],["UK"]]}," and European airports.

However, Easyjet offers the option for pre-boarding for a small surcharge. This could be well worth the money for some travellers. However, this only works where gates lead directly to the plane: if you have to take a bus to the plane, your pre-boarding will only get you on the bus early. After that, it's a scramble with everyone else, pre-boarding or not.  Requests for refunds for Speedy Boarding where planes are boarded by bus are generally met with refusal via form emails.\n\nAs of late 2012 Easyjet is now offering seat assignments (possibly only on selected routes)\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Ryanair"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Ryanair.b737.750pix.jpg"],["thumb"],["220px"],["Ryanair plane"]]},"\nRyanair ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ryanair.com\/"]},", with 65 Million passengers in 2009 is Europe's largest low-cost carrier, the 3rd largest airline in Europe in terms of passenger numbers and the largest in the world in terms of international passenger numbers. Ryanair carries more international passengers than any other airline. Fares are priced as single segment one-way trips. If you wish to change planes at one of Ryanair's hubs, then you must book the two segments separately. Luggage is not transferred and must be collected and checked in again. You can book a return at the same time as the outbound but there is no discount for doing so. If you miss a second flight due to a delay in the earlier Ryanair flight, you will not get a refund for the missed flight and will be forced to buy a new ticket at the applicable price, which may be higher than you originally paid.\n\nTickets start from €0.01 all inclusive one-way during promotions, however always check the full final cost of the fare including all \"taxes\" and \"fees\" before booking. Most Ryanair flights that are advertised for €0.01 end up costing at least €10 after such fees, even before airport tax. When booking online (the only reasonable method and possibly the only one available at all), the final cost of your reservation may be difficult to find out until you have confirmed everything, including the payment details.  Ryanair charges a credit card fee of €6 per person and segment, which can only be avoided with a prepaid MasterCard credit card. The average price one-way is about €40-50 inc. baggage and all fees and taxes.\n\nRyanair has a lot of add-on fees such as €15-20 per bag per segment. The fee for overweight luggage is €40 per kilo. There is ",{"type":"'''","value":["no"]}," free checked baggage allowance on Ryanair, plus they have strict carry-on rules about cabin baggage, only one piece which may weigh no more than 10 kilograms. The cabin baggage rules are not always seem to be enforced though. Airports which are heavily dependent upon Ryanair flights tend to be stricter about enforcing cabin baggage rules and will often check that cabin baggage conforms to Ryanairs limit on dimensions, which is currently 55cm x 40cm x 20cm. Other airports, such as Düsseldorf Weeze, will ask passengers to put their cabin luggage on a set of scales, if they suspect that the luggage may be overweight. \n\nRyanair operate a large network in Europe, and are generally (but not always) the cheapest airline on the routes where they compete with another airline.  They have 41 hubs: in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shannon"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dublin"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Glasgow"]]}," (Prestwick), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Liverpool"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]}," (Stansted & Luton), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Madrid"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brussels"]]}," (Charleroi), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Düsseldorf"]]}," (Weeze), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Frankfurt"]]}," (Hahn), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Stockholm"]]}," (Skavsta), Milan ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bergamo"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rome"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kaunas"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Barcelona"]]}," (Girona). They serve 142 European destinations as well as Morocco, with over 1,000 routes.\n\nRyanair uses small airports that can be quite far from the city they purport to serve so check your travelling time and cost estimates carefully. Coach tickets from airport to city centre may be available through Ryanair, but there may be local competition with more favourable schedules and\/or fares. Check through the airport's website, or do an online search for \"airport coach\" plus the name of the airport.\n\nRyanair keeps extremely low prices by setting a standard customer behaviour (typically an airport to airport travel without on flight meal and hand luggage only) and placing additional fees for every addition you need. So although you may be able to pick up a €20 fare for a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]}," - ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Milan"]]}," flight, in-flight meals and snacks are charged at a premium and there are other charges for things like items of checked-in luggage. Ryanair's \"no-frills\" approach is aimed at travellers requiring a basic cheap transport service. Beware of getting on last when the plane is fully booked. Because everyone takes the maximum size hand baggage to avoid paying the suitcase fee the containers for hand baggage rapidly get filled up. If there is no room for yours it will be put underneath with the checked-in baggage and you will have to wait for it to arrive at the carousel.\n\nIn order to offer faster check-in to passengers with hand luggage only, Ryanair allows passengers to check-in in advance via their website. If booked in advance, there the fixed fare €15.00 per single trip per checked bag is €15 (€20 in July and August and for international flights to and from the Canary Islands). The cost if paid at the airport is €35. Luggage weight limits are 10kg for hand luggage and 15kg for checked luggage or 20kg for an increased charge of €25. It is possible to check in a second piece of luggage, but this is charged at €35 and limited to 15kg (€40 in July and August and for international flights to and from the Canary Islands).\n\nCompared to most other budget airlines, Ryanair provides very limited compensation in the event of flight cancellations, despite the EU regulations. Typically, Ryanair will only provide a replacement seat on a later Ryanair flight (which can depart up to 3 days later than the original flight), or a full refund of the single journey price. Alternative travel arrangements and accommodation are not normally provided by Ryanair. Passengers wishing to return on the same day are normally forced to purchase a new non-advance ticket with a different airline, which can far exceed the price of the original ticket. Therefore, it is advisable to obtain insurance against flight cancellation when travelling with Ryanair. \n\nAlso bear in mind that since October 2009, Ryanair is very strict about checking in online and printing your boarding pass at home. You will be charged with a £40\/€40 issuing fee if you do not have your boarding pass with you. You must have deposited any checked-in luggage no later than 40 minutes prior to the scheduled departure time. When flying with Ryanair it is advisable to get to the airport early as bag drop desks (as Ryanair terms them) can often have long queues.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["airberlin"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.airberlin.com airberlin"]}]}," is Europe's third largest low-cost airline and the second largest German carrier.
