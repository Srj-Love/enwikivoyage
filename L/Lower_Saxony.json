Although there are different accents in several regions and some grammatical variations are regionally widespread, the language closely follows written German and is thus easy to understand.\n\nIn the north, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Low German phrasebook"],["Low German"]]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["plattdeutsch"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["Plattdüütsch"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["Platt"]}," in Low German) is widespread and even spoken alongside ",{"type":"''","value":["hochdeutsch"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["Hoochdüütsch"]},"), but it is not an official language. In some areas there are even different forms of ",{"type":"''","value":["plattdeutsch"]}," albeit very locally.\n\nIn the north and northeast, variants of the Frisian dialects are still officially recognised and spoken by a few thousands of people.\n\nWhilst English is a compulsory foreign language for schoolchildren, many adults only have a basic knowledge of the language or are not confident enough to speak it. In tourist areas, many of the signs are in two or more languages. The German national railway, Deutsche Bahn, use two languages on all their signs and, in long-distance trains, even the announcements are also made in English.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By air "]},"\n\nThe most important airports are Hanover, Hamburg, Bremen and Münster\/Osnabrück (FMO) in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Greven"]]}," (in the neighbouring state of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Rhine-Westphalia"]]},").\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By rail "]},"\nThe largest station in Lower Saxony is Hanover Central (",{"type":"''","value":["Hauptbahnhof Hannover"]},"), which has hourly connexions to Hamburg, Frankfurt and Munich as well as other long-distance destinations. It is on the high speed lines from Hanover to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Würzburg"]]}," and Hanover to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Berlin"]]},"; travel times to Hamburg are also attractive.\n\nOther large regional hubs are Brunswick (regional services to East Germany and the Harz) and Göttingen (regional services to the South Harz).\n\nThe two largest transport associations are GVH (Großraumverkehr Hannover) in Hanover and VRB (Verbundtarif Region Braunschweig) in Brunswick. It should be noted that tickets for journeys within those transport association zones must be purchase before travelling as they are not available on the trains.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Bus "]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By road "]},"\nThe largest motorways (",{"type":"''","value":["autobahnen"]},") are the A2 running from east to west and the A2 running from north to south. The A1 in the north is also an important link. The A2 has three lanes throughout, the  A1 and A7 on those sections where traffic levels are highest. In spite of that all three motorways, especially the A2, are very busy, prone to accidents and thus traffic jams.\n\nLarge cities like Hanover and Brunswick have their own networks of city motorways.\n\nImportant federal roads (",{"type":"''","value":["Bundesstraßen"]},") are the B1, B3, B4 (Harz) and B6 (Buxtehude - Celle - Hanover). Several have also been upgraded to near-motorway standard, in that they have dual carriageways each with two lanes.\n\nThe density of fixed safety cameras varies from region to region, but they are especially common in the Harz even on steep section of road. In wooded areas the risk of accidents involving wildlife is very high; wild boar in particular can cause a lot of damage to vehicles and danger to life if struck. In rural areas, straight roads with avenues of trees are also dangerous and frequently claim lives as a result of speeding or reckless overtaking.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By boat "]},"\nThe largest port is Hamburg which, although not part of Lower Saxony, is embedded entirely within it on the Elbe river.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nThere is a special ticket called the \"",{"type":"''","value":["Niedersachsen Ticket"]},"\" ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.bahn.de\/i\/view\/DEU\/en\/prices\/germany\/laender-ticket.shtml"]}," which offers unlimited travel by regional trains inside Lower Saxony area, up to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bremen"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hamburg"]]}," in one day. This ticket is not valid in high speed trains (D, EC, IC, ICE) so make sure you board the right trains (RE, RB, S-Bahn, Metronom) when using this ticket. It is valid from 9am to 3am the following day during weekdays and the whole day on weekends. There are many types of tickets, the group ticket (up to 5 people, € 38) and the single ticket (€ 22). These tickets are also valid inside public transport network in some of the cities (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hanover"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hamburg"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bremen"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brunswick (Germany)"],["Brunswick"]]},").\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Gruenkohlgericht.jpg"],["thumb"],["Grünkohlessen, a typical regional dish: kale served with ",{"type":"''","value":["Pinkel"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["Kochwurst"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["Kassler"]}," and bacon"]]},"\nLower Saxony has a number of traditions when it comes to cuisine that are often widespread, but with local regional variations. Many of the recipes are based on local food and tend to be basic, hearty and flavoursome, rather than ",{"type":"''","value":["haute cuisine"]},". An exception, perhaps, is Welf Pudding, a layered pudding made from milk, eggs, wine and vanilla, that was created by one of the chefs to the royal household in Hanover.\n\nUnsurprisingly fish dishes using, for example plaice, flounder and mackerel, feature strongly in the coastal region. Herring is served in various guises, popular ones being ",{"type":"''","value":["Matjeshering"]}," (soused), ",{"type":"''","value":["Brathering"]}," (fried) or ",{"type":"''","value":["Rollmops"]}," (pickled). Inland, trout (",{"type":"''","value":["Forelle"]},") and eels (",{"type":"''","value":["Aale"]},") are popular.\n\nAs elsewhere in Germany, pork is the most form of popular meat, with beef a poor second and lamb rarely seen. There are the inevitable regional types of pre-cooked sausage (",{"type":"''","value":["Kochwurst"]},") which is very popular in the Lüneburg Heath, the Bremen area and Schaumburg Land; local varieties include ",{"type":"''","value":["Bregenwurst"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["Kohlwurst"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["Pinkelwurst"]},". Other meat dishes from that area are ",{"type":"''","value":["Knipp"]}," a kind of smoked sausage, venison, wild boar and hare. Another heath speciality are ",{"type":"''","value":["Heidschnucken"]}," dishes created using mutton from the local moorland sheep. Two specialities from the Hanover region are ",{"type":"''","value":["Schlachteplatte"]},", a dish of assorted meat, and the ",{"type":"''","value":["Calenberger Pfannenschlag"]}," (also known as ",{"type":"''","value":["Rinderwurst"]},", a beef sausage). The internationally known ",{"type":"''","value":["Braunschweiger"]}," sausage presumably originates from Brunswick. Around Gifhorn and Wolfsburg a form of black pudding called ",{"type":"''","value":["Pottwurst"]},", served with ",{"type":"''","value":["Sauerkraut"]}," (pickled cabbage), is popular in the autumn.\n\nThe most common accompaniment is the humble potato, boiled potatoes (",{"type":"''","value":["Salzkartoffeln"]},") being by far the most common. Another popular vegetable, very typical of the area, is ",{"type":"''","value":["Grünkohl"]}," (kale), sometimes known as ",{"type":"''","value":["Braunkohl"]}," especially in Bremen and Brunswick Land.\n\nAsparagus (",{"type":"''","value":["Spargel"]},") is eaten as a great delicacy in Lower Saxony. It is grown mainly around the towns of Burgdorf, Nienburg, Brunswick and in the Oldenburg Münsterland as well as the southern part of the Lüneburg Heath and on the Stade Geest.\n\nSoup is a common form of starter. Particularly popular is ",{"type":"''","value":["Hochzeitssuppe"]}," (\"wedding soup\"), a meat broth. On the North Sea coast there a plant called arrowgrass, known locally as ",{"type":"''","value":["Stranddreizack"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["Röhrkohl"]},", grows in salt meadows immediately by the coast and is prepared, like ",{"type":"''","value":["Grünkohl"]},", as a thick stew. Other country dishes in the coastal region are ",{"type":"''","value":["Steckrübeneintopf"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["Birnen, Bohnen und Speck"]},", both types of stew.\n\nThe Germans are great cake eaters, popular regional varieties being butter cakes (",{"type":"''","value":["Butterkuchen"]},") and, around the Lüneburg Heath, ",{"type":"''","value":["Buchweizentorte"]}," (buckwheat cake) which is like a gateau and very tasty.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:tee mit sahne.jpg"],["thumb"],["East Frisian tea"]]},"\n\nLower Saxony is home to many breweries, for example in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jever"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Einbeck"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Celle"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lüneburg"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brunswick (Germany)"],["Brunswick"]]},", Allersheim (part of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Holzminden"]]},"), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hanover"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wittingen"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Peine"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Göttingen"]]},".\n\nTwo of the oldest beers, brewed since the Middle Ages, are ",{"type":"''","value":["Braunschweiger Mumme"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["Goslarer Gose"]},".\n\nIn general the Lower Saxons prefer coffee to tea, except in the regions of East Frisia and Friesland where tea is popular and often drunk with ",{"type":"''","value":["Kluntjes"]}," (rock candy) and cream.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bremen"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hamburg"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Magdeburg"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kassel"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["52.756111"],["9.393056"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Germany"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Lower Saxony"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Lower Saxony"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Europe\/Germany\/States\/Lower Saxony\/"]]}]
