Lubbock has experienced steady growth for several decades and today occupies approximately 125 mi² (324 km²). The city is home to approximately 230,000 residents and students.

Together with Elvis Presley, he is considered to be one of the founding fathers of rock-n-roll. (In fact, it was watching Presley in concert in Lubbock that led Holly, originally a country and folk singer, to turn towards rock music.) Tragically, Holly's life was cut short at the age of 22 when he died in a plane crash in Iowa, together with Ritchie Valens and J.P. \"The Big Bopper\" Richardson. Nevertheless, today Holly still lives on in his hometown by way of the Buddy Holly Center."]]}," \n\nLubbock County was founded in 1876 and named after Thomas S. Lubbock, a signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence and subsequent Confederate officer.  Mr. Lubbock didn't have any particular ties to the area; but the area bore his name because a state administrator penciled in names of counties on a crude map of the Panhandle - at random. The modern town of Lubbock was not established until 1890 when old-Lubbock and the smaller town of Monterey struck an unusual alliance and merged the two communities, a deal most likely initiated by rival town promoters hired by area ranchers and merchants to lobby Ft. Worth & Denver for a rail depot. The site of Monterey was chosen in lieu of the new township's name, Lubbock. Old-Lubbock's residents relocated to Monterey just south of the Yellowhouse Canyon, dragging the Nicollete Hotel with them on rollers. Lubbock became the county seat in 1891 and incorporated as a city in 1909.\n\nIn 1923 ",{"type":"'''","value":["Texas Technological College"]}," was founded after a contentious bid war among several area cities including ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amarillo"]]}," and Plainview.
