Later, it became part of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lesser Poland"]]}," which was the major part of Poland since the Polish capital was moved from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gniezno"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kraków"]]}," in 1040. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lublin"]]}," played an important part in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, as it was here, that the Union of 1569 was signed, the constitution of the Commonwealth. The highest court of the Commonwealth was also situated in Lublin since th 1580s. During the Renaissance a unique and beautiful kind of architecture developed in this region, the so called Lublin Renaissance. Beautiful castles and palaces and whole cities ware built in the 16th and 17th century in the region of Lublin. Also the greatest Polish Renaissance poets and writers came from this region. After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795 most of its territory was annexed by ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Austria"]]},", but became independent as part of the Duchy of Warsaw between 1807-1815. After the Congress of Vienna it became part of the Kingdom of Poland, ruled by the Russian Tsar. After World War I the region of Lublin became part of the Second Polish Republic, but was occupied by Nazi-Germany between 1939 and 1944, when it was part of the German Generalgovernement. After World War II it again became part of Poland. Nowadays it is situated quite in the east of Poland, although it was a central Polish region in the time of the Commonwealth.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nLublin opened its own airport in December 2012, with a train station inside the airport terminal providing quick and easy access to Lublin's rail network.
