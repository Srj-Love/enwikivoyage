Due to its location at a crossroads between the rest of Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine and Russia, the city was always a melting pot of different cultures - an important center of Judaism as well as of the Christian reformation movement. From the 17th century onwards, together with the rest of the country, it suffered a gradual decline.\n\nDuring World War II the Jewish and Polish populations suffered heavy losses with many people being interned and killed at Majdanek, a Nazi concentration camp. In 1939, the city's Jewish population numbered 42,380, nearly a third of the total population.  The war and Nazi crimes reduced the Jewish population to a mere 4,553 by 1945.  After the war, the city developed to be an important university site, with six state universities and a number of smaller ones.  As well, the city served as Poland's post-war capital city for approximately six months after the Soviet occupation forces installed a puppet regime.\n\nToday, Lublin is an beautiful mid-size city with its own particular Renaissance style, called the Lublin Renaissance.
