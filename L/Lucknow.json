If coffee and tea is something you like, you will find a huge variety at Capuccino Blast at Mall Avenue.  At Akbari Gate, during winters one can also enjoy Kashmiri Tea (a red coloured hot tea) with cream and Makhan Malai (a local variant of ice cream, saffron flavoured, made by hanging unsalted butter overnight in dew and then aerating it by beating it).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Budget"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Alzaiqa"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Near Novelty Theatre"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=You can find great non-vegetarian food here, specially chicken."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Dainik Jagaran Chauk"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Cheap and delicious non-veg food"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Dastharkwan"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Near Tulsi Theatre"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Haji Sahib's Shop"],["url="],["email="],["address=Akbari Gate"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=7AM-10AM"],["price="],["content=This is in the heart of Old Lucknow.
