The town has the districts of Pflugfelden, Eglosheim, Hoheneck, Oßweil, Grünbühl, Neckarweihingen und Poppenweiler. Ludwigsburg is a very young town, in comparison to many other towns in Germany which were founded during the Roman period or earlier.\n\nLudwigsburg was founded in the baroque period. In 1704 the baron Eberhard Ludwig started building a small palace in the area, and one year later is was named Ludwigsburg palace. In 1709 the first housing around the palace appeared and another year later the construction of the gardens began and the palace was enlarged and completed. In 1718 the area became the new settlement of Ludwigsburg.\n\nIt is somewhat unique for having a Catholic and Protestant church opposite each other in the main square, and is home to some large stately homes.\n\nIt makes for an easy day trip from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Stuttgart"]]},".\n\nThere is a significant film school, the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Filmakademie Baden-Wuerttemberg"]}," that makes a significant contribution to Germany's film industry and attracts a lot of young people to this town.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nThe easiest way into Ludwigsburg is to take a train from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Stuttgart"]]}," to the Ludwigsburg S-Bahn station.
