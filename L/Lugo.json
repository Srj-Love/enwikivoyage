It has a population of around 100,000 people, and is home to a considerable student population with a campus of the nearby University of Santiago de Compostela to the south of the city centre. The city is well known for it's historic roman walls which circle the old town, reaching a height of almost 15 metres - they are still in excellent condition, and remain completely intact. Their historic status is recognised internationally, and form a UNESCO world heritage site.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nThe city was founded by Celts, who named it Lugos after the Celtic god of light, oaths, and the arts. It remained a small town of little repute until the Middle Ages when it became a seat of pilgrimage. This was because the cathedral would show the Blessed Sacrament to the public 24 hours a day.\n\nThe roman walls which give the city its famewere built between 263 and 276 AD to defend the then Roman town of Lucus Augusti against local tribes and Germanic invasion. However, their success in the defence of the town was limited, and over the next 700 years the town was invaded and sacked by Suevi, the Visigoths, the Moors, the Christians and the Normans.\n\nIn 1833 Spain was split into provinces, and Lugo became the capital of Lugo province, which gave it more status, which was further helped by the railway arriving here in 1875. The city kept on growing as an administrative centre, and when the Civil War broke out it was quickly under the control of Franco’s fascists.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nBy air, the closest airport is ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.aena-aeropuertos.es\/csee\/Satellite\/Aeropuerto-Santiago\/en\/Page\/1048690016783\/ Lavacolla"]}]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["SCQ"]]},"), about two hours by bus away.
