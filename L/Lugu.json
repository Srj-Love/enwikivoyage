The area is protected from extensive development.\n\n2690 metres above sea level located at the borders between Sichuan and Yunnan Provinces, covers an area of 50 square kilometers with the average water depth of 45 meters and the transparency 11 meters. In the lake there are five islands, three peninsulas and a sea-wall islet. Here everything looks as if it has not been disturbed by human beings at all and still remains in its primitive state. Boating in the lake, you can feel that the surface of the water is as smooth as a mirror and the water as blue as the sky. The slow – canoe in the blue lake, the beautiful Mosuo girls in their ethnic clothes and the Mosuo folk songs will show you something of primitive simplicity and peace. Lugu Lake has the fame of a fabled abode of immortals and “Plateau Pearl\" for its pure and virgin land of natural landscapes. \nThe Mosuo people living here still keep their matriarchal society system. The \"Axia visiting marriage\" system (actually no marriage system at all) is called the fossil for the study of the development of the human being society .The members of the big matriarchal families live in harmony, love dearly and care for one an other. The Axia couples live in their own mothers' houses without a real family life are less burdened economically. They free themselves from such worries as daily housework, quarrels and the obligation of a husband-and-wife relationship. Here, a colorful ethnic custom painting, is an ideal place for traveling, holidays, recuperation and scientific research.
