The Lummi Indian Reservation is situated on a peninsula east of the island, but does not include Lummi Island. The island has a land area of 23.97 kmÂ² (9.255 sq mi) and had a population of 822 as of the 2000 census. The population nearly doubles in summer when property owners from both Canada and the U. S. arrive for summer fun and relaxation.\n",{"type":"==","value":["History"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Deer on Lummi Island.jpg"],["250px"],["thumbnail"],["Deer on Lummi Island"]]},"\nThe island was originally called Sa nam a o (\"High Mountain\") and Skallaham by the native Indians. In 1792 Spanish explorers dubbed it Isla de Pacheco, and it was later known as McLoughlin Island. In 1853, the U.S. National Geodetic Survey charted the island as Lummi, naming it after the tribe. It is believed the name comes from luminara, referring to the bonfires the Spanish saw upon arrival and whence the tribe also took their name, though there are also theories that it is derived from a native word or phrase. The Island post office came into existence in 1882. At that time mail was addressed to \"Beach Washington\" which was the name of the town. Today Island mail is addressed to \"Lummi Island Washington\", though the Beach School and Beach Store Cafe retain the Beach community name.\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By ferry"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Lummi Island ferry pier.jpg"],["250px"],["thumbnail"],["Lummi Island ferry pier"]]},"\nThe island is accessible by a 22 car ferry, the Whatcom Chief run by Whatcom County Public Works.
