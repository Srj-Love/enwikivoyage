It's the biggest city of the region and a major Ukrainian cultural centre on the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["UNESCO World Heritage List"]]},".\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThe city has a multicultural history which has survived to today. It was founded in 1256 by King Daniel of Galicia (Ukrainian: Король Данило Галицький - Korol' Danylo Galyckyy) and fell under Polish control in the 14th century. Poles, Jews, Ukrainians, Germans and others lived there together for centuries. This multicultural experience virtually came to an end during and after WWII. Germans, with the help of Ukrainian nationalists, killed most of the Jews (about one third of Lviv's population at that time) and, at the end and in the direct aftermath of the war, the Polish population (about 50 % of the population) was first partly driven out by nationalist terror, then \"repatriated\" to Poland in its new borders by the Soviet government. The Polish and Jewish heritage is hardly preserved, but one can find some inscriptions on former shops in Polish, Yiddish and German.\n\nIn recent times, because of Lviv's proximity to Europe and openness to foreigners, the city's multicultural feel has experienced a resurgence. Even today, walking through the city center, a traveler can hear Poles laughing and taking pictures of the beautiful old buildings, Germans walking through the city on guided tours, Ukrainian or Russian tourists and students joking about this or that, and American or British businessmen chatting in cafes. There is even a small Jewish community in the city. The many universities in Lviv attract students from every continent on the globe, and its old architecture draws tourists from various parts of the world, including Ukraine.\n\nThe Polish king John II Casimir founded the Lviv University in the 17th century and Lviv (known as ",{"type":"''","value":["Lwów"]},") was by that time one of the most important cities in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, along with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kraków"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Warsaw"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gdańsk"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vilnius"]]},". \n\nIn 1772 the city was taken by the Habsburgs and in Austrian times it was known as ",{"type":"''","value":["Lemberg"]},", the capital of Galicia. After the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918, it was returned to Poland. \n\nAs result of World War II Stalin moved the Soviet frontier westward so Lviv became part of the USSR under the name ",{"type":"''","value":["Lvov"]}," (still widely frequent, even locally). With the Ukrainian independence in 1991, the name was officially changed to ",{"type":"''","value":["Lviv"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["Львів"]},").\n\nLviv is located in the most Ukrainian region of Ukraine. When it was a Soviet province, most signs were only in Ukrainian, and only a few also in Russian. Because of its Polish and Austro-Hungarian history, Lviv has a Central European flair in its architecture that makes it one of the most beautiful cities in Eastern Europe. Lviv has even been called \"the capital of Ukrainian culture\". The people there are very warm, though somewhat direct (which is very common in eastern Slavic cultures).\n\nSince slightly before the Euro 2012 soccer tournament, the city has become more and more tourist-friendly. All downtown street signs are in both Ukrainian and English, and the staff of the Information Center on Rynok Square speaks many different languages. Maps, schedules of local events, and tourist guides can be obtained there for free in English, German, Polish, and Russian. There are even small information kiosks beside some monuments (small touch-screen tv's that offer maps and information about the city). Visiting Lviv is very rewarding for the pioneer traveller, as living is extremely cheap here and the place has a truly authentic feeling, unlike places like Kraków or Prague, which are swamped with tourists.\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Lviv airport.jpg"],["thumb"],["Old terminal seen from the airfield"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Lviv international airport"],["alt=Міжнародний аеропорт Львів імені Данила Галицького"],["url=http:\/\/lwo.aero\/"],["email="],["address=Liubinska str., 168"],["lat=49.81287"],["long=23.96002"],["directions=is within the city border just 7 km from the beautiful central city.

The music and dress code here are also a bit more relaxed. Tunes range from disco to rock, with a little techno and house thrown in. One distinguishing feature of the music is volume; not cranked so loud you can’t hear yourself think, but not a library either. There is free coat check, and most patrons are dressed casually, which in Lviv means like models on their day off. The stellar lighting also makes this place a popular venue for concerts.
