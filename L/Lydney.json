[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Lydney"]}," is a small town in the  county of Gloucestershire. It is located between the Forest of Dean and the River Severn on the A48.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nLydney is an essential place to visit for anyone with a sense of adventure, and a journey down the A48. The high street may not be the most packed, but there is a wide selection of takeaways and hairdressers for your enjoyment. There truly is something for everyone, some of the pubs may even sell soft drinks too! Easily avoidable due to the bypass, Lydney may have seen more visitors to its many, many, attractions in years gone by, and yet this has only had minimal impact on the carefully managed financial and social ecosystem that resides on the banks of the River Severn.\n\nAdmittedly, there are better places to visit, but none has the same sense of nervous enjoyment you get as when you walk past a group of teenagers after dark. This isn't a big place, so murder is harder to get away with. But will that stop them trying?\n\nThe architecture has much to be learnt, and town planning is a silly idea for Americans, but still there is something extra about Lydney that makes you happy to get back on the road, no matter how long the journey has been thus far. With more housing estates than you'd have though for such a small town, there are many places that can be explored, and a selection that can be enjoyed too.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["Lydney can be reached by road from the A48 running from Gloucester and Chepstow where you can access the M5 and M4."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Lydney railway station is located on the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gloucester (England)"],["Gloucester"]]}," - ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Newport (Monmouthshire)"],["Newport"]]}," line.
