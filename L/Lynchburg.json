It lies east of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Blue Ridge Mountains"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Central Virginia"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nLynchburg, Virginia began in 1757 as a ferry town, fording traffic across the James River. The city is built on centuries of history, boasting strong connections to Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry, and other early American patriots. Because of the city's use by the Confederacy as a supply and hospital center, it served as a battlefield in the American Civil War. Lynchburg has been designated a portion of Virginia's Rail Heritage Region. Lynchburg's historic districts contain many beautiful homes from the 19th century.\n\nLynchburg's name is derived from its founder, John Lynch, who, at the age of 17, began a ferry service across the James River to facilitate travel to and from New London. He would later be responsible for the bridge which would make his ferry service obsolete. Despite common misconceptions, neither John Lynch nor Lynchburg is associated with the origination of term, \"lynching,\" though it may have originated with John's brother, Charles.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Geography and climate"]},"\nLynchburg's nickname, the \"City of Seven Hills,\" is very descriptive of the geography of the city. Though it refers most directly to the hills near where the city was founded, these hills extend far beyond the riverfront at the James River. The area includes much of Candlers Mountain.\n\nSpring in Lynchburg is short-lived, often it is simply a period of wide fluctuation between mid-late winter and early-mid summer temperatures. Summers are humid and hot with temperatures generally reaching 90°F. Autumns are mild; temperatures stay somewhere between 40°F and 55°F. Once winter hits, temperatures will top out near freezing until February and, perhaps, beyond. Recently, winters have brought lots of snow to the Lynchburg area, bringing about three one-foot snowstorms each winter.\n\nGenerally, storms will pass through over the course of a few hours, but rain systems without lightning and thunder will stick in Lynchburg for days at a time, lending to the nickname \"Drenchburg.\" When there is wind in Lynchburg, it tends to be a very high wind. Unlike nearby areas, the warmest part of the day in this part of Virginia is generally 5PM.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Information Center"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Lynchburg Visitors Center"],["url=http:\/\/www.discoverlynchburg.org\/"],["email="],["address=216 12th Street"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 434 847-1811"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Daily, 9AM-5PM"],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nLynchburg currently does not have direct interstate access. Instead, you can get to Lynchburg by one of three major U.S. Routes: U.S. 29 North and South, U.S. 460 East and West, and U.S. 501 North and South. U.S. 501, however, is generally only convenient for travel from the immediate northwest and southeast.\n\nU.S. 29 merges with U.S. 460 at a three-way junction. When traveling to Lynchburg via U.S. 29S, a right exit is required to continue along U.S. 29S \/ U.S. 460W.\n\nDrivers arriving in Lynchburg should be wary of exiting onto Candlers Mountain Rd in particular. The timing of the first two intersections off U.S. 460 tend to trap drivers at the first intersection at Mayflower Dr. Also, construction on a bridge just beyond Mayflower Dr will reduce traffic to one lane. (This construction should begin 16 Apr 2012 and should end no later than 23 Nov 2012.)\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Lynchburg Regional Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["LYH"]]},") ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.lynchburgva.gov\/index.aspx?page=85"]}," is just south of the city limits alongside U.S. 29.

The Crescent runs through Lynchburg on its way between New York City and New Orleans. For the Northeast Regional, Lynchburg serves as one of two southern terminals. The train continues from Lynchburg toward either Boston or Springfield, MA.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nDriving is perhaps the most convenient way to get around Lynchburg. Apart from the Downtown area, most of the city is not very friendly to pedestrian traffic.\n\nThe Lynchburg Expressway connects most of the major roadways in Lynchburg, intersecting and merging with the business segments of U.S. 29, U.S. 460, and U.S. 501.\n\nThe city limits are very clearly marked and are drawn in such a way that some places within the city are inaccessible without first traveling outside the city. For instance, the planned community at Wyndhurst can only be accessed via Enterprise Dr, which terminates in two different counties.\n\nAlso note that a few major roads change names with no clear indication as to where these changes take place. For examples, Lakeside Dr becomes Forest Rd, Fort Ave becomes Timberlake Rd, and Memorial Ave becomes Fifth St.\n\nSeveral lots and limited on-street parking are available in Downtown Lynchburg. Two lots, the Midtown and Clay Street Parking Decks, are metered, operating on the mPARK system used in several other cities in the United States and abroad.\n\nDuring the afternoon rush hour (4:45PM - 5:45PM), Candlers Mountain Rd, Wards Rd, and Timberlake Rd experience significantly increased traffic.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nSeveral dispatch taxi services operate in Lynchburg.\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=City Cab Company"],["url="],["email="],["address=413 Jackson St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 434 846-0231"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Allied Cabs"],["url="],["email="],["address=2109 12th St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 434 845-7039"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Gray Top Cab Incorporated"],["url="],["email="],["address=1107 12th St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 434 845-4554"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Hill City Cab"],["url="],["email="],["address=200 Oakley Ave"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 434 845-8554"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Greater Lynchburg Transit Company"]}," (GLTC) ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.gltconline.com\/"]}," offers bus services to the area.
