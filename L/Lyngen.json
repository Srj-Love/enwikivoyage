The original inhabitants were the Sami. The outer villages got a Norwegian population rather early on, and in the 18th century, people from Finland settled in the area. Today, almost everyone speaks Norwegian only, but Sami and Finnish is still spoken by a few elderly people. \n\nThe area is immensely suited for off-piste skiers. However, visitors will soon discover that the infrastructure is lacking. Book your accommodation early and bring all your gear, the rest the flexible inhabitants will fix on the spot.\n\nSea fishing is excellent in the area. There are plenty of boats available to hire, although shore fishing is good too. In the deep waters of Lyngenfjord (up to 300m) you can catch cod, whiting, haddock, coalfish, halibut, wolffish, redfish (Norwegian haddock) and more, and you can see porpoises and the occasional whale. There is even pretty good fresh-water fishing in ",{"type":"'''","value":["Jagervattnet"]},", a lake north of the Svendby ferry, where you can catch salmon and arctic char, although a licence is required.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nThe main language today in Lyngen is Northern Norwegian dialect, with slight variations within the municipality.

The drive from Tromsø to Breivikeidet is about 50 minutes. From Svensby, there is 25 minutes' drive to Lyngseidet. From Lyngseidet there is a ferry onwards to Olderdalen on the east side of Lyngen. ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.bjorklid.no"]}," for updated info.\n\nAlternatively you can take the longer land-only route, following the E8-E6-Rv868 all the way round Lyngenfjord. This is the route to take if you're too early or late for the ferry.\n\nThere are a couple of buses a day from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tromsø"]]}," to places like Svensby, Lyngseidet and Furuflaten. The northern tip of the peninsula is served by a bus a day, approximately, and a catamaran a couple of times a week.

The main danger is also the big attraction: The mountains are highly dangerous for the untrained. If you should hire a boat, always wear a lifejacket. The weather can change surprisingly quickly and it's not uncommon for the wind to change from a gentle breeze to a gale in minutes, so be prepared.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Troms"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Lyngen"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["69.690277777778"],["20.081666666667"]]}]
