The city centre's medieval skyline, mainly composed of seven Gothic-style church towers, is still intact. Lübeck is surrounded by parts of the old city walls with two of the original four city gates left intact. Most notable is the Holsten Gate (",{"type":"''","value":["Holstentor"]},") which was the motif on the German banknote of 50 deutschemarks until the introduction of the euro.\n\nHistorically, Lübeck was an independent city state and accumulated considerable wealth as the capital of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hanseatic League"]}," from the 11th to the 17th century. Many merchants made a fortune on shipping salt to other Baltic port cities in exchange for valuable goods needed in Germany. Many impressive warehouses are located at the old harbour and can be accessed by tourists since they host museums, shops, restaurants or pubs today.\n\nAfter sea trade substantially shifted away from the Baltic Sea to the Atlantic in the 17th century, Lübeck was slowly marginalized as a trading city against the North Sea ports of Bremen and especially Hamburg. This led gradually to a noticeable decay in wealth and eventually inspired contemporary writers to draw a resigned picture of the cities' residents, most famously in the novel ",{"type":"''","value":["Buddenbrooks"]}," by ",{"type":"''","value":["Thomas Mann"]},", who earned a Nobel Prize for it in 1929.\n\nAfter World War II, the city was ultimately marginalized due to the nearby \"Iron Curtain\" which impeded access to many trading partners in the eastern Baltic and even cut off two minor urban districts of the city itself. Despite efforts to boost commerce in the Baltic region, the city is still struggling from that time with a fragile economy that leads to a comparatively deteriorated infrastructure outside the picturesque city centre.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By plane "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Lübeck Airport"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.flughafen-luebeck.net"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=LBC is currently under court administration and only one flight per day to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gdańsk"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mallorca"]]},"."]]}]},"\nThe airport is a few kilometres outside the city centre but can be accessed by car and public transport.
