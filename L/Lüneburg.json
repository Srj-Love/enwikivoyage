The town lies about 50 km southeast of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hamburg"]]}," and is the capital of the district of Lüneburg with a population of around 73,000.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Rathaus2.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Lüneburg's Town Hall"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Early history "]},"\nArchaeological finds show that the area was known to Neanderthal hunters and, later, Bronze Age settlers. The town may have been that referred to as ",{"type":"''","value":["Leuphana"]}," by Ptolemy, but it was officially founded in 956.\n\nLüneburg was built on a salt dome which made the town important and wealthy in the Middle Ages until 1600 when it started to decline. Tradition has it that salt was first discovered by a hunter who shot and killed a wild boar bathing in a pool of water. When he hung its skin up to dry, he discovered it was full of white crystals – salt.\n\nLüneburg was originally overshadowed by the village of Bardowick to the north, which was a Slavic trading post. When Bardowick was destroyed by Henry the Lion in 1189, Lüneburg was granted town rights and took over the mantle as a trading centre. Its monopoly on salt production in Northern Europe quickly led to membership of the prestigious Hanseatic League – Lüneburg's salt was in great demand to preserve herring caught in the Baltic and North Seas. Initially salt was carted up the Old Salt Road to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lübeck"]]},", but was later transported by cog along river and canal. Lüneburg became very wealthy and, in 1371, threw out its princely ruler, the Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and destroyed his castle on the ",{"type":"''","value":["Kalkberg"]},". In 1392 Lüneburg became a free imperial town, a status which lasted until 1637. Much of the wealth stemming from the salt trade can still be seen in the town, which boasts many buildings from Lüneburg's medieval heyday.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Modern period "]},"\nThe demise of the Hanseatic League and the overfishing of herring during the 16th century led to Lüneburg's decline. New building ceased and Lüneburg survived relatively unscathed by war, which is why the town centre has largely managed to preserve its medieval character.\n\nLüneburg lost its independence in 1708, becoming part of the Electorate of Hanover, and then passed through a succession of states, before becoming part of the Prussian province of Hanover in 1866. During the 19th century it became a Prussian garrison town, but otherwise faded from the limelight.\n\nIn 1945, Lüneburg stamped its mark on history again when Field Marshal Montgomery took the German surrender on the ",{"type":"''","value":["Timeloberg"]}," hill, just south of the town. The spot is currently out-of-bounds in a military training area. Lüneburg also hosted the Belsen trial against perpetrators of the crimes at Belsen and Auschwitz concentration camps. Heinrich Himmler, infamous leader of the SS, committed suicide in Lüneburg and was subsequently buried in an unmarked location in a nearby forest.\n\nUnlike many towns in Germany, Lüneburg was spared during the Second World War and none of its historical buildings was damaged. But its historic buildings had fallen into dangerous decay. Since the 70's the town has been gradually restored to the tourist attraction it is today.\n\nIn 1980 the saltworks finally closed ending a millennium of salt mining tradition in the town. In 1990 3 of the 4 barracks were closed and the university moved to the site of one of them.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Lüneburg today "]},"\nToday, Lüneburg is thriving again as the economic and administrative centre of the region, with a strong tourist industry as the northern gateway to the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lüneburg Heath"]]}," – a popular holiday and weekend destination, especially for the citizens of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hamburg"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hanover"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bremen"]]},". It also has a popular university, its 10,000 students bringing a vibrancy to the town, balancing nicely its historical setting.\n\nAlthough salt has not been mined industrially since 1980, you can still enjoy its benefits in the two large salt baths in the ",{"type":"''","value":["Salü"]}," (see below).
