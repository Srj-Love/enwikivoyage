Historically it was where Montgomery received the German surrender at the end of the Second World War.\n\nThe area has very rural feel to it. Dense pine forests alternate with green meadows and cultivated fields with purple heath. Its leafy villages are clustered around ancient Low Saxon farmhouses - typical of North Germany - with their vast thatched roofs sweeping down over red brick and timber-framed walls.\n\nThe area has lots of attractions suitable for families such as the Heide Park near Soltau, the Walsrode Bird Park, the Serengeti Park and 3 wildlife parks. More recently the Schumacher go-kart hall near Bispingen was opened.\n\nFor those interested in exploring the culture and history there is also a wealth of museums - covering every field from agriculture to science, from warfighting to local history. \n\nLying on the great North German Plain, the region is relatively flat and there are excellent cycling routes over a network of cycle paths.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Karte Lueneburger Heide.png"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Map of the Lüneburg Heath area"]]},"\n\nThe Heath is a magnet for day-trippers and holidaymakers from the three major cities near the Heath: Hanover, Hamburg and Bremen.

It is a vast expanse of pine and birch forests, open heathland, pleasant farmland, market towns and picturesque villages; stretching from the lazy waters of the River Elbe to the north, the pine-clad hills of the Drawehn to the east, the flat depressions of the River Aller to the south and Wümme to the west, and the low ridge guarding Hamburg's southern flank to the northwest. Ideal for walking, cycling or just chilling out, it has become a popular tourist destination, especially for the cities and large towns that lie nearby.\n\nIts highest spot is the Wilseder Berg, a modest affair just 169 metres (555 feet) high, but with fine views to all points of the compass. The hills on the Lüneburg Heath are moraines - ridges of sand and gravel left by the last Ice Age. Its natural forests of birch, pine and sessile oak were grazed or cleared by prehistoric farmers to leave open heathland on the poor sandy soils. The heaths are particularly attractive in autumn covered by purple heather in bloom and buzzing with honey bees. Today the use of fertiliser has allowed much of the old heath to be reclaimed as farmland and the remaining areas of heathland have to be actively managed to prevent the woods returning. Thus the traditional moorland sheep or ",{"type":"''","value":["Heidschnucke"]},", whose rugged character is well-suited to conditions on the heath, continue to play their part in preventing the return of trees.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Orientation"]},"\n\nThe Lüneburg Heath is divided into five major natural areas:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The ",{"type":"'''","value":["High Heath"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["Hohe Heide"]},") in the centre is largely preserved as heathland and is more rugged than elsewhere.
