The capital is Łódź, which is the third biggest city in Poland. In geographical terms, the Łódź region is located on the Central Polish Lowland, in proximity to the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Świętokrzyskie Mountains"]]},".\n\nThe present-day Łódzkie is an amalgamation of cities and lands with very different history, brought together by their central location. It is a rather urbanized and industrialized region, even if the prevalent industries are the light ones, compared to the heavy industry in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Silesia"]]}," southwards from Łódzkie. As there is no major river flowing through Łódzkie, it benefitted greatly from the construction of railways that started in the 19th century, and until this day many of the important railway nodes are within the voivodeship. Moreover, Poland's two most important motorways, the North-South A1 and East-West A2, cross in Łódzkie, providing further boost to the development of logistic centres and business\/industry parks.\n\nHaving said which, Łódzkie is also rich in pre-industrial historic and folk heritage, which can be evidenced in many of the smaller towns and villages across the voivodeship. There is a wealth of local cultures and traditions, simple but very tasty cuisine and stories involving big historic names such as Napoleon or numerous Russian Tsars. While off the map for most tourists, Łódzkie is far from flyover country.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" History "]},"\nIn the early Middle Ages the Łódź region was part of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Greater Poland"]]}," which was the major part of Poland in the 10th century. However, the capital of Poland was moved from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gniezno"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kraków"]]}," in 1040. When in 1138 the Seniorat of Poland was formed, nowadays Łódź region was part of three different duchies, the south-eastern part of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Greater Poland"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sieradz"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Łęczyca"]]},".

",{"type":"[[","value":[["Piotrków Trybunalski"]]}," played an important role in Polish parliamentarism, as this was the place where the most Polish Sejms gathered since the 15th century. \n\nAfter the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 most of its territory was annexed by Prussia, but became independent as part of the Duchy of Warsaw between 1807-1815. After the Congress of Vienna it became part of the Kingdom of Poland, ruled by the Russian Tsar. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Łódź"]]},", often referred to as the Polish ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Manchester"]]},", emerged as a major industrial city in Central Europe in the early 19th century.
