Unlike most other large Polish cities, which boast impressive long histories, Łódź was created almost from scratch during the 19th century textile industry boom to house textile mills, their owners and their workers, and rapidly grew to become an important industrial and commerce centre. In recent years, Łódź has been battling rising unemployment and youth migration resulting from the failing textile industry and is repositioning itself as a hub for design and creative industries.\n\nOwing to its history, Łódź boasts an impressive collection of residential, commercial and industrial 19th-century architecture including some of Europe's largest factory buildings, now mostly repurposed as shopping centres or lofts. Recent local investment and a long-standing cultural scene ensures there is always something more to do than just sightseeing or shopping, with the city hosting some of the best museums and art galleries in the country. The close proximity of Warsaw and Łódź's location at the crossroads of the Polish motorway system make it an ideal destination for a day trip or longer city break.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Name and history"]},"\nThe exact origin of the city's name is unknown, however, the word ",{"type":"''","value":["łódź"]}," translates to \"boat\" in English. This is referred to in the emblem and when you hear the dwellers of Łódź (",{"type":"''","value":["łodzianin"]}," (man) ",{"type":"''","value":["łodzianka"]}," (woman) ",{"type":"''","value":["łodzianie"]}," (plural)) calling themselves \"the boat people\".\n\nA settlement on the area of present-day Łódź was first established in the 14th century and in 1423 it was granted a town charter, along with the right to have a marketplace. However, the real development of Łódź started with the industrial era at the beginning of the 19th century when the city was chosen to be the heart of the rapidly-growing textile industry. The population of Łódź soared from some 4,000 people in the 1830s and 40,000 in 1865 to over 300,000 inhabitants at the turn of the century, which was an unprecedented growth on a worldwide scale.\n\nThe rapid development of Łódź in the second half of the 19th century was brought about by the rise of enormous industrialist fortunes. New inhabitants, craftsmen and merchants came to Łódź; markets and town fairs came to life. The profits obtained from prosperous textile mills opened up practically unlimited possibilities for their owners. The city residences became expressions of the riches and power of the local tycoons. They were usually situated next to the owner's factory.\n\nEver since the industrial revolution brought a massive influx of workforce, Łódź had been a city almost equally divided between four cultures - Polish, Jewish, German and Russian. The day before the outbreak of World War II, Łódź was inhabited by approximately 672,000 people, among whom 35% were of Jewish faith and some 15% were ethnic German. Andrzej Wajda's movie, ",{"type":"''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0072446\/ Promised Land"]}]}," based on a novel by the Nobel laureate Władysław Reymont, depicts those times and is a worthwhile introduction to the city's bustling history.\n\nDuring the Nazi occupation, Łódź was incorporated directly into the Third Reich. The city was renamed to Litzmannstadt, and Piotrkowska Street was called Adolf-Hitler-Strasse. The Jewish community was practically wiped out, and many others lost their lives. Although the city was not destroyed in the aftermath, the material losses were serious as the machinery, raw materials and finished goods were taken away by the fleeing Nazis. The day before the liberation, about 80,000 Germans left Łódź in panic. At the beginning of 1945, the number of population was estimated at 300,000.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Plac Wolnosci Lodz panorama.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Plac Wolności"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Łódź today"]},"\nSince the fall of communism in Poland, Łódź has not enjoyed the rapid economic growth cities like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kraków"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Warsaw"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wrocław"]]}," have experienced, and has had to endure the fall of much of its textile industry, rising unemployment and emigration (both within Poland and abroad). This led to further dilapidation of the investment-starved city, and many of its streets and buildings show profound signs of neglect. At first glance, for a city of 760,000 and agglomeration of 1.428,000, there does not seem to be much to see.

Also, violent crime is very rare. Some basic advice though:\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Watch out for pickpockets."]}," A common trick for thieves is to operate in groups and create artificial crowds on buses and trams which distract their victims' attention prior to being pickpocketed. Also, do not leave your belongings unattended and keep you wallet in your front pockets.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Do not visit the city parks after dark."]}," During the day you are perfectly safe, but almost all city parks are open also during the night and there have been reported cases of muggings.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Avoid the following places."]}," Even though the city is safe, the locals will tell that you should avoid certain places if going alone. These are: Włókiennicza Street (also a small part of Wschodnia and Kilińskiego Streets that is in the proximity of Włókiennicza), Abramowskiego Street, Solna Street and Limanowskiego Street.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Avoid displaying football-related emblems."]}," The hooligan scene in Łódź is quite large and very divided.

",{"type":"'''","value":["This advice holds for every Polish city."]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Be careful when using pedestrian crossings."]}," Even though pedestrians have right-of-way on pedestrian crossings, some Polish drivers do not respect that.

This applies to all Polish cities.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Beggars"]},"\nŁódź hasn't been developing residentially quite as rapidly as some other more successful Polish cities recently and has some of the most deprived urban areas in Poland, but such issues are handled by the government and (especially) NGOs.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Do not ever give any money to beggars."]}," This advice should apply to any Polish, European or global city.
