These symbols were once common in the Netherlands, especially in Amsterdam. Today they are very rare on buildings.\nUsually the head is of a black or Moor man. This is because in the 15-17th centuries, pharmacists would travel through the country with an assistant trying to sell their medicines. Before an audience the pharmacist would give a pill to his assistant. These were often Moors. The assistant would act better.\nSo pharmacies became known by the assistant's head."]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=The Netherlands Drugstore Museum"],["url=http:\/\/www.drogisterijmuseum.nl"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=26 Apr-31 Oct: W-Sa 11AM-5PM, Su 1PM-5PM.
