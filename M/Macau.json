Like many other places, it has also had organised crime; in the 1990s there were gang wars sometimes involving automatic weapons in the streets. However, after the 1999 Chinese takeover the gangs were rather firmly crushed and today Macau is no more hazardous than any other major tourist destination.\n\nChina uses the slogan \"one country, two systems\" for relations between the central government and the two SARs, Hong Kong and Macau. Both are part of China, and neither can have an independent foreign policy or military force, but each has it own laws and legislative assembly and issues its own visas and currency. The governing systems are complex and some locals complain that they are insufficiently democratic and there is too much control or influence from Beijing.\n\nIn recent years, Macau's economy has bloomed rapidly due to the opening of the gambling licenses. Thousands of tourists are in Macau each day, mainly from mainland China and neighbouring regions. The standard of living in Macau has as a result grown significantly, and in many cases, is on a par with some European countries.

Hong Kong dollars are accepted by most businesses on a 1:1 basis, but most businesses will endeavour to give you change in HKD if you pay in HKD, if they have them. Occasionally, however, a business might give change in MOP notes and HKD coins or the other way around. The HK$10 coin may not be accepted because of numerous recent forgeries. Chinese renminbi (RMB, less often CNY) are also accepted in some areas and can easily be changed for either patacas or HKD.

Change enough HKD to tide you over, and then change the rest into patacas after arriving. The money changers at the Barrier Gate provide good exchange rates, and you can also change the HKD you are holding into patacas.\n\nOn the other hand, try not to leave Macau with a lot of patacas. Unlike the HKD, they are quite hard to exchange in most countries. Even if you try to exchange them in Hong Kong, money changers may charge high commission thus giving you fewer HKDs than for what the MOP is worth.  Therefore because of the 1:1 acceptance between the HKD and MOP and the difficulty exchanging between the two currencies outside Macau, you are advised to use HKD as much as possible for commercial transactions.\n\nVisa and MasterCard credit cards are widely accepted in major restaurants, stores and the ferry terminal but some merchants may require a token minimum purchase amount, usually $100.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Tipping"]}," is generally not practised, though bellhops may expect about $10 or so for carrying your bags.

If you wish to give a tip, you should give it in cash directly to the person you wish to reward for their good service.

There is also a wine museum in which you can have the opportunity to taste over 50 varieties of wine.\n\nThere is a buzzing nightlife in Macau. There are a variety of bars and clubs along the Avenida Sun Yat Sen close to the Kum Iam Statue and the Cultural Centre where you can have a good night out. Locals, especially among younger people, prefer to meet up with their friends in western style cafes or places that serve 'bubble tea'. 'Bubble tea' are usually fruit flavoured tea served with tapioca balls and can be served either hot or cold.  The shops in town centre (near Senado Square) often open until late at night and are often crowded.  The casinos have also become a big hit for entertainment, offering performances of international level (advance booking advised) and comprehensive shopping malls for those less interested in trying their luck with the machines.  For ladies who want to pamper themselves after a shopping spree, there are Spas available in almost all respectable hotels. Note that these are different from \"saunas\", which are thinly disguised brothels (prostitution is legal in Macau), but these can be easily distinguishable by their shop appearance.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nThe bulk of Macau's hotels are on the Peninsula, although there are also many options - including high-end ones - on Taipa and, increasingly, the Cotai Strip, which is challenging the Peninsula to become Macau's premier casino area. Coloane, which offers fewer and much quieter options, has accommodation ranging from the famous Pousada de Coloane to Macau's two beach-side youth hostels.\n\nHotel rates are most expensive on Friday and Saturday nights, because demand is higher with tourists coming to Macau to gamble over the weekend. Try to make a booking through a travel agent, even if for the same day, as the rates can be substantially lower than walk-in rates. If you are coming from Hong Kong, book through an agent at the Shun Tak ferry pier for the best deals. Getting a package deal including return ferry tickets gives you the best price.\n\nIn the Inner Harbour area, many of the pensions and two star hotels are also the place of business for many of the mainland PRC prostitutes that work in Macau, and most hotel \"saunas\" are in fact thinly disguised brothels.\n\nHotel listings are in the individual district pages.

The process takes approximately a month to receive a work permit, at which time employment may begin, and another 1–2 months to receive the Blue Card.\n\nAs illegal employment has over the past decades been a problem plaguing Macau, the authorities do crack down severely on any offenders (both worker and employer) caught.

The standard of living of the local Macau residents is generally good (one of the best in Asia). In addition, as a city geared towards tourism, the Macau government is keen to \"clean up\" the city and its image. For example, the police in Macau is now seen by the public as more effective than it used to be.\n\nThe following points should be noted when you travel to Macau.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" You should beware of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["pickpockets"]]},", especially in crowded areas like tourist attractions and the border stations.

Some people experience cold symptoms after moving between the two extremes often; it is not unusual to wear a sweater or covering to stay warm indoors, and it is therefore usually good advice to carry a long-sleeve item of clothing when expecting to visit air-conditioned places for extended periods of time.\n\nWhilst tap water is technically safe to drink (taste aside), most locals boil or filter their water or buy inexpensive bottled water which you are also recommended to do so.\n\nBecause of the region's history battling SARS (as well as later dealing with avian flu (H5N1)), good personal hygiene is strongly advisable. \n\nThere have been some cases of Dengue fever in recent years.

However, do not assume the locals speak English (or Portuguese) and a few essential Cantonese phrases are always helpful. \n\nWhen visiting Chinese temples basic respect should be shown, but taking photos is usually allowed and you don't need to ask for permission as long as there isn't a no-photography sign posted.\n\nBinge-drinking or drunken behavior is not tolerated in Macau.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\nMacau's international dialing prefix is ",{"type":"'''","value":["853"]},".\n\nThe tourist information offices on Largo do Senado and at the jetfoil terminal have maps, information on museums and events, helpful English-speaking staff, and at the Largo do Senado office free Internet access.
