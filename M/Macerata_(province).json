It has a very complete citadel wall surrounding it with arched gateways leading into the steeply cobbled centre, each one different. The streets are very narrow, some only 2.2 metres wide so don't be tempted to drive in. Park outside and wander through the fascinating interior which makes you feel as though you have wandered into a film set.There is a theatre which operates mainly in the Winter months but can be visited in Summer through the toursit offfice. There many hilltop towns and villages but this is one of the most interesting and hardly altered. To give you an idea one gateway is called the porta Nuova and it is 17th century.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Itineraries"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nTwo particularly good ristorante just a stone's throw from the centre are Il Casolare dei Segreti, contrada San Lorenzo which has a seasonal menu, limited choice but that to me is usually a good thing as everything is fresh. The food is Marchigiani but modernised, sometimes with a twist. Their tiramisù has a base of a globe of home made coffee ice cream and is to die for. Go towards Appignano from the centro storico and take a left turn signed San Lorenzo. It is 3 km at the top of a hill on the left. best to book.  Il Villino is also good particularly for the grilled meats, especially the tagliata of vitellone served on a cast iron palter to keep it warm. The owners came from Argentina over 20 years ago and know a good piece of beef when they see it. The food here is more rustic more none the worse for that and the quality is excellent. Again best to book. There are bars and pizzerias in Treia centro storico and a gastronomia which sell very good ready cooked local dishes, different every day so if you are staying Treia in a rental house you can eat good local food at home if you don't want to eat out every night and its very reasonably priced. It si on the right hand side as you go towards Appignano about 200 metres from the centro storico.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nDirections to Il Casolare dei Segreti: sorry it is on the right not left.
