[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["S-amer africa default banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Machala"]}," is a city in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["El Oro"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nMachala is known as the 'banana capital of the world' because of its central role in exporting Ecuador's bananas. It's hardly a tourist destination (guidebooks describe it as chaotic, oppressively hot and dangerous) but for those travellers who do find themelves here it has a certain charm and some good places to eat.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nYou can walk just about anywhere within town in Machala within about half an hour. This is safe during the daytime, but less so at night.\n\nBuses cost $0.25 anywhere, and loads of bus lines go between Puerto Bolivar and El Cambio and El Shopping. Number 1 bus does this for example.\n\nTaxis cost $1 within town, $3 to the port (Puerto Bolivar), $2.50 to El Shopping and $1.50 after midnight. Taxis will try to charge gringos more - in contrast to many places the best way to avoid this is NOT to ask the price before getting in. Instead, take the taxi wherever you want, hand the taxi driver a dollar and get out.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nPuerto Bolivar is Machala's port, about 20 minutes away by bus ($0.25) or 15 minutes by taxi ($3). You can see big ships being loaded with bananas, if you particularly want to.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nTalk to Machalenos. That's about it!\n\nYou can also go to Jambeli beach. From Puerto Bolivar, take a boat ($3) for half an hour to Jambeli. Whether it's worth the trip or not is debatable - although Jambeli is popular with Ecuadoreans its a narrow, quite dirty, very busy beach (especially at the weekend).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nThere is one (overpriced) shopping centre called (amusingly) El Shoping. Not sure where the other 'p' went. It's out of town towards El Cambio.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nThere is a wonderful pizza place on Manuel Estomba and Buenavista run by an Italian Machaleno called Claudio. Proper Italian pizzas - not cheap cheap, but very good value (about $5-7 per person plus drinks).\n\nNaturissimo has two branches one on Rocafuerte between 9 de Mayo and Juan Montalvo, the other in the Shopping. They make delicious fresh yoghury and pan de yuca. It has to be tried to be believed! About $3 per person.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nThere's a Zona Rosa, but it's not very safe for non-Ecuadoreans after dark (or for Ecuadoreans for that matter).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nHotel San Francisco, on Tarqui between Sucre and Olmedo, is clean, modern and friendly. Rooms start at around $14 per person, more for air-con.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nBuses to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guayaquil"]]}," take 3 hours, and run every half an hour during the day and evening. Rutas Orenses on Tarqui and Bolivar are recommended (they cost $6 but are reasonably safe - the route from Machala to Guayaquil is known to be a bit dodgy).\n\nLoja Internacional goes to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Loja"]]}," and takes 6 hours. Buses about every hour.\n\nTAC and Pinas go to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zaruma"]]}," (3 hours, $3)\n\nCIFA Internacional goes to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Peru"]]},", with a through bus over the border.
