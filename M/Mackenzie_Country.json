In the early 1960s, technological advances made it possible to export large amounts of electricity out of the South Island to the power-hungry North Island, and the Mackenzie Country became a hive of hydroelectric scheme construction. The towns of Otematata and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Twizel"]]}," were established to house workers building the four dams, 50 km (30 mi) of canals, and six power stations which today produce one-sixth of New Zealand's electricity needs. When the scheme was finished in 1985, most of the workers' houses in these towns were sold off as holiday homes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["NZ State Highway 8"]}," is the main road in and out of the Mackenzie Country.\n\nDaily bus services operate between Christchurch and Queenstown via the Mackenzie Country, with stops at Lake Tekapo, Twizel and Omarama.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThe Southern Alps provide a magnificent backdrop to the Mackenzie Country.

For a closer look, NZ State Highway 80 runs along the west shore of Lake Pukaki to Aoraki Mount Cook National Park Village.\n\nLake Ruataniwha, 4 km south of Twizel, is the South Island's premier rowing venue. Rowing regattas are held regularly on the lake during the summer months, but the two big draw cards are the National Championships, held in late February in odd years, and the National Secondary School Championships (Maadi Cup), held in late March in even years.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nThere are many ",{"type":"'''","value":["outdoor activities"]}," in the region, including:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Hiking in Mount Cook National Park"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Ski\/snowboard at some of the small fields like Ohau"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"<","value":["gallery",{"heights":"200px","perrow":"3","widths":"200px"},["\nFile:Aoraki-Mount_Cook_from_Lake_Pukaki.jpg|Mount Cook\nFile:Shaun muckle mtcook.jpg|Lake Pukaki\nFile:Lake Tekapo 2, New Zealand.jpg|Lake Tekapo\nFile:Lake_tekapo_church.jpg|Church of the Good Shepherd, Lake Tekapo\n"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["-44.060000"],["170.450000"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Canterbury (New Zealand)"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia: Mackenzie Basin"]]}]
