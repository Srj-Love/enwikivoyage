(The \"Mich\" is pronounced \"Mish\", just like in the name of the state; at least that's consistent.)\n\nThe regional names are consistent, considering the local Indians (various tribes) had their way of pronouncing and area, and the French and English had their way of spelling what they heard from the Indian pronounciations.  Michigan remains very historic in this sense. It has kept the spellings and pronounciations as were origninally given by Indian, French and English.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Itineraries"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Mackinac Bridge Walk"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.mackinacbridge.org\/annual-bridge-walk-7\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=This event takes place every year on Labor Day (the first Monday in September).
