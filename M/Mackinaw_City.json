The \"Mighty Mac\" (a certain burger vendor objects to another nickname) is 5 miles long and at its highest, 200 feet from the surface of the Straits of Mackinac.  The toll is $1.25\/axle for passenger vehicles (that's $2.50 for a car or motorcycle), $2\/axle for motor homes, and $3\/axle for anything else.  The drive can be a little intimidating, but only two vehicles have gone over the edge in its half century of use: one a lightweight Yugo caught by very high winds, the other an SUV in a suicide; both were speeding.  If you're uncomfortable driving across, a bridge authority employee will happily drive your vehicle for you (including motorcycles--they love Harleys). Just ask the toll collector.  The bridge closes to traffic when the winds exceed 65mph, but is otherwise open all the time.\n\nThe car ferry service that connected the two peninsulas before the Bridge was built is no longer available.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By other means"]},"\n\nAlthough pedestrians, bicycles, and snowmobiles are not permitted on the Mackinac Bridge, the bridge authority will take you across, for $2 per person and per bicycle, or (8AM-8PM only) $10 for each snowmobile and rider.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThis could be interesting, if you somehow got to Mackinaw City without your own vehicle your options are really limited as there is no public transportation.

Be warned that since the primary mode of transport for goods and people on Mackinac Island is the horse there is usually also a far amount of \"spent horse fuel\" about so this can indeed make an interesting combination of odors. The island does maintain a fleet of hardy souls that follow behind the horses to try and keep the streets clean. Given the number of horses and the number of scoopers they do an admirable job. You can walk, bicycle or take a carriage tour of the island to get around. Those that are used to horseback riding can visit a livery and rent a carriage if you wish.

The Soo Locks are about one hour past the bridge on I-75. The city is actually called Sault Sainte Marie, and to confuse things just a bit there is one on each side of the border there in the U.S. and Canada. The Soo Locks enable the shipping that transits the Great Lakes access to Lake Superior when traveling in the upbound direction and the materials from the shipping ports of Lake Superior access to the rest of the world without being off loaded at the St. Marys River where the elevation between Lake Superior and Lake Huron change. Stop at the locks and watch the ships go by, to those of you from elsewhere in the world they are ships, you will find that most native born Michigan residents call them \"boats\" and the ocean going vessels plying the lakes are \"salties\". Just as a  fun fact a \"saltie\" is required to take on a lake pilot when entering the Great Lakes.
