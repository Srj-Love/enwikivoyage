As it is, though, few foreigners get visa to visit and many Muslims refuse to enter the area due to a section in the Qur'an (Al-Hijr 15:80) often interpreted as a curse against it.

You should take most of a whole day to drive around the various rocks. Unfortunately the guides seem to be very light on historic knowledge, and some may make up things as they go along. Reading up on the Nabatean culture before you visit would make the stay more enjoyable, the graves do after all look pretty similar and you may get 'templed out' after seeing two dozen of them without background knowledge. There are no facilities inside the area, take food and plenty of water with you in the car. The area is also nice for hiking among the big rocks, however make sure your police escort allows you to do so.

The tight quarters of small mud buildings are mostly deteriorated, however as of 2011 the Ministry for Antiques is renovating parts for tourists, an alley was already mostly brushed up at the time of writing.
