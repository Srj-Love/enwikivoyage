The province has a population of over 365,000. It has mountain ranges interrupted by river valleys and fertile plains.

On the coast temperatures go up to 35 degrees but in the mountains it is much cooler.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Goroka#Go next"],["Mt Wilhelm"]]},", the highest mountain in the country, lies at the border of Madang and Chimbu provinces. Mountain ranges run through the province, with waterfalls cascading hundreds of metres. Despite logging and agriculture (sugar, livestock, cocoa and copra) there is still much pristine rainforest. The major river is the Ramu, which is navigable by dugout or motorised canoe. A recent development is the RamuNico nickel mine, which has attracted considerable controversy with its plans to dump large quantities of tailings in the sea.\n\nThe coastline of Madang is volcanically active. Manam Island recently erupted. The crater of the imposing Karkar Island can be visited. Numerous species of bird, including birds of paradise, are found in Madang. The province also has huge butterflies. Madang plays host to many different tribes and up to 200 different dialects are spoken.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Morobe"]},"\n\nHuon Gulf is the area on the northern coast of Papua New Guinea occupied by Morobe Province, which has a population of close to 600,000.

The province gets much of its income from the importance of Lae as a port that exports produce from the Highlands, but the Markham Valley in the province is also an important agricultural area. Oil exploration and mining are growing in importance and there is a timber industry in the Bulolo area.\n\nHuon Gulf offers spectacular scenery, accessible diving spots, and a range of climates from sub-alpine and alpine to tropical. The Province's jungles and forests offer over one thousand species of birds and mammals, including the Raggiana Bird of Paradise, the Cassowary, a flightless emu-like bird, and the tree-kangaroo. Over 15,000 species of plant have been identified and there may be many more.\n\nThe Province has many battlefield relics from World War II, with submerged shipwrecks, aircraft and artillery.
