You can catch them at the central bus station near the market. Each vehicle has a number to indicate its destination. You can also flag down any passing vehicle with the right number. Vehicles are typically crowded. Passengers will be intrigued and interested if you join them this way if you're obviously visiting.\n\nThere are many boats visiting its port, so there are likely options for water travel also.\n\nIt is almost impossible to get around Madang township after 6:00pm. There are no taxis, and it is not advisable to walk around the town after dark. If you need to be somewhere else for dinner or drinks (apart from your hotel), make sure you pre-arrange a driver to take you there and pick you up. Therefore, plan to spend most evenings at your hotel \/ resort for dinner &\/or drinks.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nFor information when you arrive: Madang Visitor and Cultural Bureau, 852-3302 .\n\nMany visitors come to Madang for the fine Scuba diving available in nearby waters.

The shoreline around the town has many small sandy swimming spots with grass, large trees and shade.\n\nIt is a great town to relax and recuperate. Large stores have most amenities the traveler will need, as well as a lot of local items that are interesting to see and try. Local residents are curious but reserved around travelers, but are usually friendly and helpful when approached.\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Coastwatchers Memorial."]}," This is a working lighthouse on Madang Harbor.

A wide variety of fruits and vegetables are available.\n\nOutside of Madang are many small villages. Many of these offer tours and will show you local customs and their way of life. The people are extremely friendly and a tour is highly recommended. Any of the hotels in town can organise this for you for approx US$25\/person for an afternoon including all transport. \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Krangket Island"]}," is a short boat trip from Madang with boats leaving every half hour from the small boat terminal.

Accommodation is also available on the island (Krangket Lodge) for 80 kina per night.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["North Coast"]}," There is a old WWII Japanese airfield which is now pretty much completely covered by Jungle. There is a lot of old plane wreckage and bomb craters still scattered around the place, including a large reasonably well-preserved Mitsubishi 'Betty' Bomber.\n\nAlso on the north coast are some very pretty little missionary stations, most with beautiful views and also a lot of WWII history.

At least not typical tourist trinkets. In the villages they will offer you pottery to buy or local crafts.\n\nThere is a local market open everyday except Sunday, but this sells mainly fruits and vegetables. Some people sell a few bags, necklaces, t-shirts etc.\n\nThe Madang Resort and Madang Lodge also have their own onsite craft shops. These are probably the best places in town and are reasonably priced.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nThere are not many restaurants outside of the few hotels who serve both guests and people passing by. The golf club serves meals and drinks though its weekday daytime hours can be limited. Some stores sell a limited selection of local 'fast' food. You may be able to find someone to sign you in as a guest to the members-only boat club that is a favorite of local business people and ex-pats.\n\nThe usual cautions apply for visitors eating in developing countries. Places catering to tourists are clean, the food is fresh and the water safe to drink. Seafood and produce are plentiful. Fresh coconuts are easy to buy and provide a refreshing drink. Ask someone for help, and they'll quickly brandish a large knife seemingly from nowhere and expertly cut it open.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Madang Resort Hotel"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.madangresort.com\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=Caters to scuba divers (who seemingly don't leave the resort, except by boat) with an on-site dive shop.
