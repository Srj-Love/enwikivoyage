Its constant mild climate (temperatures between 20 and 27°C) keeps the spring on Madeira all year round. The levadas, an ingenious system of stone- and concrete-lined watercourses distributing water from the rainy north to the dry south, help flowers and crops flourish all year. That's why this island is called the ",{"type":"''","value":["Garden in the Atlantic"]},". The maintenance pathways for these water canals provide wonderful level trails for hiking in the mountains (up to 1861m) and through the tremendous landscape.\n\nUnfortunately, Madeira was hit by several catastrophes in 2010: in February heavy rainfall inundated parts of the island and caused destructive floods in river valleys on the south coast of the island, chiefly in Funchal, Ribeira Brava and Tabua. Reconstruction work of lost bridges and roads has now been largely completed, but the legacy of major forest fires in August of that year is likely to last longer, and some upper mountain footpaths in the east of the island remain closed or interrupted. Further floods in the 'Nuns' Valley' in October 2010 caused more damage to infrastructure, but this has been repaired. Despite all this, the authorities and locals have been hard at work ensuring that Madeira's tourism infrastructure has returned largely back to normal, and there is still plenty to see and do on Madeira!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.anam.pt\/Madeira-297.aspx ",{"type":"'''","value":["Madeira International Airport"]},"\/Funchal"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["FNC"]]},") (formerly known as Santa Catarina Airport), about 30 minutes from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Funchal"]]},", in Santa Cruz municipality.
