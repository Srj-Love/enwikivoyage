Spring and autumn are definitely the best times to visit, especially the months of April, May, June, September and October.

During the 2nd Republic (1931-1936) was a bustling city of new ideas. Being capital of the Franquist dictatorship (1939-1975) made the city still seemed to represent a conservative part of Spain to many Spaniards. However, the city is also the epicentre of the famous Movida, Spain's 80s movement that bred personalities such as the director Pedro Almodóvar. The heritage of this era is indeed still visible in the city centre, where a party can be found at all times and one of the most liberal and colourful environments of Spain can be seen.

During summer many offices, however, will have a summer schedule requiring workers to start at 8AM and finish at 3PM (most commonly without the standard 1-2 hour break for lunch). Offices usually close during the weekend but businesses are often open Saturday morning (downtown stays open until afternoon). Most grocers are closed on Sundays, but some major chain and department stores linked to \"culture\" (books, music, etc.) will be open throughout the day and all of them on the first Sunday of the month. Shops and department stores in Puerta del Sol area are open every day.\n\nMadrid possibly has the largest number of bars per capita of any European city and a very active nightlife; Madrileños are known to stay up until as late as 5AM-7AM. It is quite common to see a crowded Gran Vía on weekend nights. It is important to note that, due to this lifestyle, lodging located near the fun areas may end up a nightmare for light sleepers if your window faces the street.\n\nMadrid has a very modernized and elaborate transportation network of buses and Metro. The city contrasts with some large European cities in that it is extremely clean, and city employees in bright yellow vests can almost always be seen cleaning the streets and sidewalks. Like most large cities, however, there is a substantial population of vagrants and beggars lining the streets.\n\nMadrid is one of the biggest and most cosmopolitan cities in Europe.

Sometimes there can even be traffic jams in the ",{"type":"''","value":["Paseo de la Castellana"]}," at 3AM (early to some Madrileños). The problem is compounded by the narrow streets in the old town, where a lorry delivering beer barrels to a local bar can cause a huge tailback. Finding a parking space can be very time consuming, and difficult if one is not skilled in the art of close proximity parallel parking. Many Spaniards are also lacking in this art, prompting them to simply park in the street, blocking other cars in. If you find yourself blocked in by such a practice, honk your horn until the driver returns. If you parallel park your car in Madrid, be aware that most Madrileños park by sound alone. They will feel no remorse for repeatedly hitting the car in front and behind them while trying to get into or out of a tight spot. If you value your car's paint job, or you have rented a car, it may be best to park underground. Though this is no guarantee for nobody hitting your car, the chances are somewhat diminished.\n\nFor free parking but within walking distance of 20 mins to city centre (Sol), try the street at Principe Pio metro stop. The place to park is the street near to the shopping mall called Calle de Mozart. It is packed with cars on weekday mornings because of people getting to the Metro station. During the evenings and weekends it's easy to get a parking spot.\n\nIn short, renting a car is not only unnecessary, but not recommended for getting around downtown Madrid, and a car is likely to be more of a liability than an asset.

The police are visible, and the city is equipped with cameras.  There are always a lot of people in the streets, even at night time, so you can walk across the city generally without fear.  Travelers who remain aware of their surroundings, and keep an eye on their belongings should have little to worry about.\n\nMadrid has a significant amount of nonviolent ",{"type":"[[","value":[["pickpockets"],["pickpocket"]]}," crime so always watch any bags you have with you especially on the Metro and in busier public spaces. It is important for your safety to avoid falling asleep in the metro, which can leave you particularly vulnerable to thefts.  It is not unknown for thieves to cut jean trouser pockets in order to steal belongings.\n\nBe careful when carrying luggage, especially if anyone approaches you with an outspread map in hand asking for directions. This may very possibly be a trap to distract you while an accomplice steals your luggage.\n\nWhen using ATM machines, be aware of your surroundings, just as you would anywhere.  Bring a friend if you need to withdraw cash after dark.  If someone approaches you while using an ATM, simply hit CANCELAR, retrieve your card and move on.\n\nHave fun when going out, but do avoid drinking too much, and keep an eye on your drink.  Beware of thieves preying on people leaving night clubs who have had a lot to drink. Do NOT carry valuables on a night out.\n\nBeware of anyone who approaches you and asks you to write down your signature: it is normally for a \"sick hospital\" unit, and she will point out the \"stamp\" on the paper. She will then ask for a generous donation of €20 or more.  This distraction can often be used to block vision while a pickpocketing or theft attempt is made.\n\nBe aware of young men and boys who are indicating they are deaf\/homeless trying to get you to sign a piece of paper.  This also can be a ruse to distract you in order to steal your belongings. These thieves sometimes enter cafes\/bars so make sure you do not leave wallets\/phones on the table as possessions on show make for easy targets. The area around Calle de las Infantes near Gran Via is particularly renowned for this.\n\nAvoid people offering masaje (massages).  Be firm and say \"No me toque\" (Don't touch me) or \"No tengo dinero\" (I don't have any money) and keep walking.
