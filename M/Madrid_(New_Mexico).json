Madrid flourished into the 1930s, with a large Independence Day parade, a Christmas display which attracted visitors from all over the state, and the first lighted stadium in the Southwest.  The town declined with the falloff in coal usage until the mines were closed in the 1950s;  Madrid never became a true ghost town (it was never completely abandoned), but by 1970 its population had dropped to 30.  However, starting in the 1970s, the area became a magnet for creative artists.  Madrid is now a small but thriving art colony numbering 200 or more.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nState Highway 14, from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Santa Fe (New Mexico)"],["Santa Fe"]]},", passes through downtown Madrid.
