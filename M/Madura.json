A larger contrast to the largely lush and fertile ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Java"]]}," next door is hard to imagine.\n\nThose geographic and climatic reasons, together with a lack of well known sights, make Madura as ",{"type":"''","value":["off the beaten path"]}," for travellers as it gets in this part of Indonesia.\n\nHistory has not dealt the people of Madura a kind card. The island was in an almost perpetual state of conflict with different parts of the island siding with different kingdoms in various medieval Javanese conflicts. In the colonial period the rulers of the east and west Madura were often allied with the Dutch and, in return for protection, provided natural resources and troops. In World War II the Madurese suffered enormously under the Japanese.\n\nThe opening of the Suramadu Bridge in mid-2009 might just begin to change the ",{"type":"''","value":["off the beaten path"]}," nature of Madura though. There are large investment plans mooted and many of these focus on developing Madura as a tourist destination from 2010. Only time will tell but the omens look good for an island that has had little go in its favour for so long.\n\nTales and legends have developed around Madurese women who are famous throughout Indonesia for one thing: secretive sex techniques known as ",{"type":"''","value":["goyang Madura"]},".  These seem to involve clenching vaginal muscles in a way not unlike ",{"type":"''","value":["Kegel"]}," exercises, assisted with herbal preparations like the ",{"type":"''","value":["tongkat Madura"]}," (Madura stick) that were a minor hit in Japan a few years back.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nThis is a ",{"type":"''","value":["very"]}," dry and hot island recalling arid eastern parts of Indonesia.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Tourism Information Office"]},"\nMadura Regency Tourist Information Office: \nJalan dr Sutomo No 5, Sumenep, Madura. \nTel: +62 328 667148, Tu-Sa, 7AM-3PM.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nThe local language is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Madurese phrasebook"],["Madurese"]]},", but standard ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Indonesian phrasebook"],["Bahasa Indonesia"]]}," is widely spoken.

The one way toll is Rp 30,000 for a car or van and Rp 3,000 for a motorbike. It is perfectly possible for visitors to cross to Madura independently using a car or motorbike rented in Surabaya.

Avoid public holidays and the Ramadan period altogether. Since the opening of the bridge, travellers are perhaps better off avoiding the ferry altogether.\n\nFor the adventurous, there is another ferry route into Madura from Jangkar in the Situbondo regency of north eastern Java. The crossing takes about 5 hours and the schedules are weather dependent and by no means certain.
