It is a circular route which starts from ",{"type":"'''","value":["Chiang Mai"]}," and takes you through ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mae Hong Son Province"]}," ending back up at Chiang Mai.

If you're planning to do the loop in the winter months (Nov-Feb) take warm clothing (light jacket, sweater, trousers) as temperatures can drop at night.

The windy road up to the peak of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Doi Inthanon"]]},", 2,500 m in elevation, is also a national park.  There are some remarkable waterfalls along this route including Mae Ya and Wachiratharn. You will also pass plenty of hill tribe market stands along the roadside selling local produce. Just before the summit there is a viewpoint where two impressive royal chedis stand majestically on the side of the mountain.  This spot sometimes offers a good view of the valley below, however most of the time visibility is masked by the clouds due to the high altitude. Standing shrouded in this veil of clouds at the highest point in Thailand feels quite ethereal. As if you were on top of the world. \n\nBack down to the base of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Doi Inthanon"]]}," and onto Mae Chaem, a traditional town home to a mix of hill tribes such as the Lisu, Hmong, and Lawa. From here you can either head straight to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mae Hong Son"]]}," via ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Khun Yuam"]]}," on Rte 1088 or take the off-road route to Mae Sariang.  \n\nThe town of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mae Sariang"]]}," retains much of the charm, culture, and character that is often missing in areas filled with tourists. In recent years, many bars and cute hotels have opened along the riverside. The hiking routes here are arguably the most authentic in the north and are popular with travellers seeking a less commercialised trek.  Surrounding the town are many sights and potential day trips such as Mae Sam Laep, the Burmese-style village on the banks of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Salawin River"]]}," where a longtail boat can be hired for the day to cruise down the river, the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.dnp.go.th\/parkreserve\/asp\/style1\/default.asp?npid=146&lg=2 Salawin National Park"]},", and Mae Ngao National Park. Near the local Mae Sariang Boripat Suksa School, there is an open-air muay Thai stadium where you can take Thai boxing classes. Up the road to Mae Hong Son, there is a cultural centre with arts and crafts. You can even learn woodcarving there. Mae Sariang is a great place to rent a bicycle and explore the surrounding rice fields. \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["2) Mae Sariang to Mae Hong Son"]},"\nAfter ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mae Sariang"]]}," the next destination is the capital of Mae Hong Son Province,",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mae Hong Son"]]},", which is also the half-way point on the loop. \n \nMae Hong Son lies at the bottom of a valley among the mountain ranges that form the border of Burma and Thailand. Its remote location gives it a secluded and tranquil feel, while its proximity to Burma gives rise to the mix of people who reside there: Burmese, Shan, Thai, and hill tribe groups. This volatile blend of people and cultures gives Mae Hong Son a very distinct feel.\n  \nThe centre of the town is built around Nong Jong Kham Lake and temple where you will find an array of guesthouses and restaurants. A small evening market where locals and hill tribes come to sell their wares, is also held here daily . It's a great place to pick up handicrafts and souvenirs such as woodcarvings, silverware, precious stones, and antiques.\n \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mae Hong Son"]]}," boasts numerous Burmese and Shan-style temples. The most famous of them, and a must-see attraction, is Wat Doi Kong Mu, which sits on a hilltop and offers spectacular views of the town below. Other sights and activities include hill tribe treks, long neck Karen villages, elephant riding, bamboo rafting, and Phu Klon Country Club, a health mud spa.\n\nThe segment on Hwy 1095 from Mae Hong Son to Chiang Mai is arguably one of the most scenic drives in the north, but is not for the queasy. This mountain road is reputed to have over 1,864 curves in it. The jolts and bends on this road make it the fun fair ride of the north, but the continuously spectacular views make it worth it.  The journey can be broken up by stop-off visits to Pha Sua waterfall, Tham Pla fish cave, and Tham Lod. Tham Lod, which means \"coffin cave\", is a favourite among tourists and is near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Soppong"]]},". It is famous for its stalactite and stalagmite formations and ancient wood coffins. A bamboo raft and guide can be hired to explore the cave. \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["3) Mae Hong Son to Pai"]},"\nThe last destination on the loop, also worth spending an overnight, is the town of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pai"]]},", an unexpected find in a remote mountain valley.  Twenty years ago the town of Pai was a few dirt roads and shops. As tourists discovered the natural beauty of the Pai River and its surrounding valley, businesses and development followed not long after, and it turned into the little backpacker settlement that it is today. Popular among hippy and artistic types, both Thai and foreign alike, the feel is very much new-age.\n\nThis small town is filled with bohemian cafes, restaurants, book stores, and guesthouses. During high season, from Oct-Feb, the nightlife comes alive and the tunes of Bob Marley can always be heard. During the day visitors take advantage of the hot springs, rafting, and trekking opportunities in the beautiful surrounding countryside.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["4) Pai to Chiang Mai"]},"\nAfter a relaxing respite in Pai the loop is almost complete. Some 120 km back on Hwy 1095 will transport you out of the rugged mountains and back to the sprawl of Chiang Mai.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineitinerary"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["related"],["Mae Hong Son Province"]]}]
