It is one of the remotest provinces in Thailand. Tourists are attracted to the area due to its pristine virgin forests, spectacular mountains, lush valleys, indigenous wildlife, and fascinating hill tribes. Pai district has now evolved as Thailand ‘hippiest’ hang-outs, second only to Ko Pha Ngan. It is the most mountainous province in Thailand and encompasses 13,814 square kilometres. It is virtually covered with mist throughout the year. The terrain is highly suitable for the training of elephants. Former rulers of Chiang Mai used to organize the round up of wild elephants which were then trained before being sent to the capital for work.  Today, Mae Hong Son is a prime destination for visitors. Daily flights into its small airport bring growing numbers of tourists, attracted by the spectacular scenery, numerous hill tribe communities, and soft adventure opportunities.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["People"]},"\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Thai Yai"]}," (Shan) can be seen along the northern border with Burma.  They may at one time have been the most numerous of the ethnic Thai tribes that stretch across Southeast Asia.  A large group settled in Mae Hong Son. \n  \nThe Thai Yai culture has had a strong influence on the province, as can be seen in its architecture. Although a part of the Lanna region, the indigenous Thai Yai people living in Mae Hong Son are faced with cold weather during winter and extremely hot weather in the summer, with mist or fog practically throughout the whole year.  Not surprisingly they have had to adapt to the environment.  As a result, their architectural style has developed into something different from other Lanna communities.  Their living quarters are usually built with tall floors and low roofs, the sizes differing according to one’s social status and position. Homes of ordinary folk are usually with one single level of roof, while those of the local aristocrats have two or more levels forming a castle-like shape.   The space thus provided is believed to help air circulation.  A signal feature of the Thai Yai style is the perforated design along the eaves which serves as an architectural marker of the style.\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Padaung"]}," are a sub-group of Karen refugees originating from the eastern Burmese state of Kayah on the Thailand border. \n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Karen"]}," themselves are not one single group but rather a loose mix of closely-related tribes. Among the smallest of the Karen tribes in Thailand are the Karen ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Padaung"]]},". This group’s women are strikingly recognized for the large brass rings they wear around their necks, thus lengthening them. They number fewer than 40,000 people. The Padaung call themselves \"Lae Kur\" or \"Kayan\" and they have their own unique language which originates from Tibeto-Burmese.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Itineraries"]},"\n\nThe ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mae Hong Son Loop"]]}," is one of the most comprehensive ways to explore the province.
