Tak is on the regular bus route between Chiang Mai and Bangkok.\n\nFrequent mini buses connect Mae Sot directly with Tak bus station, starting at 05:30 and ending around 19:00, and should depart every 30 minutes from the lower end of Burmese market. However those that are already full can be expected to leave early, and those that are not will probably go late. The journey takes about 90 minutes and costs approximately 78 baht\/person. The surcharge for putting a bicycle on the roof rack is 50 baht. There is a through bus from Mae Sot to Sukothai, via Tak.  \n\nThere are buses in the early morning and late evening from Mo Chit Bus Station in Bangkok. A single ticket for the VIP buses cost approximately 613 baht per person. Try to get a spot on the top level of the VIP bus as you are not near the toilets at the bottom level. There are also cheaper first and second class buses- 394 baht and 306 baht respectively. The buses leave Mae Sot and Mo Chit early in the morning and throughout the evening, day bus or night bus. This means that after approximately 7-8 hours of travel time you reach your destination very early, around 17:00 depending on the bus you take. Tickets on first class and VIP buses entitle you to a free light meal and\/or drink at a half way stop. There are motor bike and tuk tuk taxis at Mae Sot bus station. It is best to have a map of your destination, with Thai directions, if possible. The typical fare into town or to one of the guest houses listed here, is between 50-100 baht. Negotiate prior to embarking.\n\nTickets for the scheduled buses to Chiang Mai can be purchased at the bus office on the Asian Highway, while a ticket to Bangkok can be purchased from the main bus station. Chiang Mai buses leave at 06:00.\n\nSongthaews travel frequently to Mae Sariang (north) and Umphang (south). They leave from the market or you can flag them down on route, but beware they are bone shakers and sometimes very full.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By air "]},"\nMae Sot Airport (MAQ) is about 2 km west of the edge of town, and just 1 km from the border. ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.nokair.com Nok Air"]}," operates flights from Bangkok and Chiang Mai.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get around "]},"\nGetting around town is pretty simple by foot but if you are looking for other forms of transport, bicycles and motorbikes can be rented at many guest houses for approximately 50 baht per day and  150 baht per day respectively. A helmet is supplied as the police fine people not wearing one. You have to leave your passport for bond and fill up with petrol when you return it. Cars and 4 wheel drives can be hired from several places around town (e.g., Well Driving, close to Casa Mia). Be very careful as the driving in Thailand can at best be described as unconventional and at worst, downright dangerous.\n\nTaxis come in the form of motorbike or tuk-tuk, usually found near the Burmese market and outside Tesco. The drivers have special licence number jackets. Obviously, prices depend on distance and passengers, but as a rough guide, 50-100 baht will get you to most places around the town.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" See "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Maesot2.jpg"],["thumb"],["Chedi of Wat Chumphon Khiri"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Gibbon Sanctuary"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Take the light blue songthaew #48 from the main road for an hour and a half; ring the bell to disembark at km41.5."],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=While many other animals reside here, the gibbon sanctuary houses dozens of rescued gibbon, of the great ape group, who are often adopted as pets and then neglected by their owners when they reach adulthood.
