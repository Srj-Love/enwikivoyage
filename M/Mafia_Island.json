[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Mafia Island banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Mafia Island"]}," off the coast of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tanzania"]]}," must be one of the Indian Ocean's best hidden gems.\n\nWith white sandy beaches, dazzling aquamarine waters and refreshingly few tourists, Mafia is often described as Zanzibar 30 years ago. A laid-back eco-alternative with no tarmac roads, few hotels, no shops, no ATMs (credit cards are accepted at the up-market lodges) which is not geared for mainstream tourism. Be warned, if you want fancy shops and a wild night-life, Mafia isn’t for you!!!\n\nThere are six lodges on Mafia, five (",{"type":"'''","value":["Chole Mjini , Kinasi Lodge , Mafia "]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["Pole Pole"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Shamba Kilole"]},") clustered closely together within Chole Bay and one, the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ras Mbisi Lodge"]},",  on the western side of the island . Additionally there are a handful of backpacker friendly ‘hotelis’ in Kilindoni, the main town (the port and airstrip are here). \n\nHopefully Mafia Island will not becomes the ‘next destination’ but remain an eco-friendly niche. Currently there are about 3000 to 4000 over-night stays annually on the island. However an annual Mafia Dance Festival is planned and will take place each August on remote beaches bordered by coconut plantations.\n\nWhale sharks and Humpback Whales can be found in the waters surrounding Mafia Island, as can turtles and so rumor has it so can dugongs.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThere are two airlines with regular service from Dar es Salam to Mafia's Kilindoni airport and flights take about 30 minutes.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Coastal Aviation"]}," - operates two daily flights from Dar es Salam and one \"on-demand\" from Kilwa, their largest plane is a 13-seated Cessna, flights cost USD110\/person (",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.coastal.cc"]},")"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Tropical Air"]}," - based in Zanzibar, flights to Mafia originate in Dar es Salam (",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.tropicalair.co.tz"]},")"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThere are only a few jeeps owned by the resorts or lodge. You can hire a rickety Land Rover with driver near the market in the center of Kilindoni.  The street are all still murran, so it could be really fun to wonder about walking and get a bit lost along the main street where you will meet all the locals working, interacting, bicycling, playing, etc. If you are more adventurous you can rent a bike from the place you are staying. The price should be anything from 8 to 15usd\/day.\n\nThe most fun whatever is to take a typical sailing boat(dhow) which here do also bus services. They have a wonderful structure all woodmade and usually full of residents with dresses and pots of different bright colors.\nAlmost all diving centers and Lodges will offer you also excursions around the Island.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Ras Kisimani"]}," is the far western cape of the main island, facing the Rufiji Delta. Kisimani Mafia, just north-east of the Cape is KiSwahili for “the place of the well”. An old town dating to the 12th Century has been drowned by rising sea levels and a collapsing foreshore for over 100 years. The Kinasi library contains a full account of the archaeology of these ruins, once the most important town on Mafia, especially from the 12th to 14th Centuries. It was founded by Bashat, one of the sons of the first Sultan of Kilwa, and extended the control of the Sultan to Mafia. The power and wealth of the Sultan of Kilwa was based upon gold, ivory and customs tariffs on all goods traded on the southern coast. In its time it was far more important the Zanzibar but its economic influence waned upon the arrival of the Portuguese at the end of the 15th Century. There is little left of the town now, but visitors can easily find many beautiful potsherds and coins in the ruins and on the beautiful palm-fringed beach. The circular rock weights used to confine slaves at night can also be found here. Due to erosion the old well from which the town took its name now stands on the beach. The whole area is now a protected core zone of the Mafia Island Marine Park.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Bwejuu Island"]}," sits between Ras Kisimani and the Rufiji Delta and is a sand-fringed, palm-covered island surrounded by sand bars and snorkelling reefs. These are all-day excursions by boat from Kilindoni for beach-lovers and those looking for a castaway experience. Beautiful beaches and fabulous swimming along the edge of the Ras Kisimani point and off the reefs and sand bars of Bwejuu.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["The Lighthouse at Ras Mkumbi"]}," : A visit to the lighthouse will allow you to see far to the south over the Mlola Forest, protected for its vegetation and wildlife, including Sykes monkeys. There are magnificent baobabs in the north of Mafia, especially at Ras Mkumbi (the northern tip of the island, just beyond Bweni village.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Jibondo"]}," is Mafia best-known fishing village. The island is about 30 minutes away by boat. Over-fishing resulted in a decline in shark populations but the people still harvest a great deal of octopus. Seaweed farming is becoming an important business. The Jibondo people are famous throughout the Swahili-speaking world as boat-builders.Unlike Chole, Jibondo island is almost entirely coral rock (ancient Porites coral) so no crops can grow in the shallow soil. There is always a water shortage and many of the younger people spend a great deal of time carrying water from sources on the main island.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nDiving, snorkeling.
