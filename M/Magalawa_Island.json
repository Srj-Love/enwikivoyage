The said sitio was bisected by a small body of water fordable by people wherein the current flows southeast during high tide and northward during low tide. The current that runs in this area is about 2-3 knots. In that situation erosion made this body of water wider and wider, which later on became a sea. This came when this part of the land was isolated far from Sitio Luan, so the inhabitants called in their native word \"mag-luwa\" that means \"about two places\". This word passed through generation to generation and was later changed to \"Magalawa\".\n\nMagalawa is an island lying 6 km northwest of Poblacion. Surrounding the island is the China Sea. Beyond the north is the San Salvador Island of Masinloc and on the east is Sitio Luan, Lipay. It is known for beautiful beaches. Magalawa is 56 hectares in area.\n\nAlthough the island is surrounded by the sea potable water is abundant on the island. The main source of livelihood is fishing and some are engaged in shell craft industry. There is a primary school with two teachers. No rice is planted in this area, so people resort to buying everything they need except fish. Coco trees and century trees are abundant. \n\nMagalawa Island is now one of the newest tourist destination in Zambales. An eco-tourism resort, Magalawa Island Armada Resort, a privately owned resort, has been developed since 2009 and now continually on its rise with its back to basic and nature trip settings. Just recently, to be able to provide and generate livelihood to the island community, management of the Armada Resort have come up with packages which include meals, snorkeling, rafting, boat riding, mangrove trekking. These helps the community in providing livelihood and help generate income for its barangay and municipality.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nMagalawa Island Armada Resort - with its creamy white sand beaches and pristine waters Magalawa Island is perfect for swimming, water\/sand sports, boat riding, jet skiing, scuba diving, snorkelling or just relaxing on the beach amid the crystal clear waters and white sand.
