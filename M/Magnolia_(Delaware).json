[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"],["pgname=Magnolia"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Magnolia"]}," is located in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Central Delaware"],["Kent County"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Delaware"]]},". It is nestled between the towns Rising Sun, Delaware and Little Heaven, Delaware. Magnolia is south of Dover, the state capital, and is about a mile away from the St. Jones River. Similar to the surrounding towns, Magnolia has great small town appeal. To give you an idea of just how small it is, the entire town has two stop lights. It was founded in 1885 by Thomas H. McIlvaine, John B. Conner, Thomas Draper, James L. Heverin, William S. McLain, John W. Wall, Alexander Jackson, Jacob Prettyman, and Captain James Grier. \n\nMagnolia is the namesake of the Magnolia Tree, the favorite of the Duke of York, who originally owned the land that came to be known as the town of Magnolia.Currently the city is home to 211 people. It is a common spot for tourists to drive through on the way to the beaches located in southern Delaware.\n\nThe town is a family friendly place, home to two local schools, McIlvane Elementary School and St. Thomas Moore Prepatory. The town emanates a very strong sense of community. It is as sweet as its name suggests. The small town appeal is really what makes Magnolia special. People are very close knit and this is adds to the sense of safety individuals feel around town. Although you have to travel outside of the town's limits for more shops, sleeping, and eating places, not having access to these things has a sort of calming affect on people who do not want the hustle and bustle of even small city life (like the town of Dover). \n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Town of Magnolia"],["url=http:\/\/magnolia.delaware.gov"],["email="],["address=P.O.

Magnolia sees its fair share of rain and is quite humid in the warmer months. \n\nThe town is centered around Main Street. This area is home to some of the town's most notable places. \n\nThe story behind the town's boundary lines is quite interesting. When the boundaries were first decided, the founders believed that creating the boundaries in the shape of a circle would be representative of brotherhood. Although, the expansion of the town has come up many times, if you search Magnolia on Google Maps today, you will still find the original circle boundaries decided by its founders. Magnolia consists mostly of small housing developments and farming land. Many new developments went up over the past few years during the housing boom. As one might expect, the town has a number of beautiful Magnolia trees. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Stores"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Magnolia Furniture.JPG"],["thumb"],["Magnolia Furniture"]]},"\nThe only store in Magnolia, this sweet family business will fulfill all of your furniture needs.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["buy"],["name=Magnolia Furniture"],["url=http:\/\/www.magnoliafurn.com"],["email=magnoliafurn@comcast.net"],["address=40 South Main Street P.O.
