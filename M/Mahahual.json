However a large cruise ship docking jetty dubbed \"",{"type":"[[","value":[["Puerto Costa Maya"]]},"\" has been constructed just up the beach.  Every day a couple of cruise ships dock and the occupants are disgorged onto the town to drink, shop, swim and ride jet skis and quad bikes.  However the further south away from the cruise ship dock you go the quieter the town becomes, so it's still possible to have a quiet time of it, especially at some of the hotels south of town.\n\nHurricane Dean (August 2007) landed just North of Mahahual and heavily damaged the cruise ship dock and destroying much of the small village. Most residents have since rebuilt and cruise ships have returned to using Puerto Costa Maya on 31 October 2008.\n\nAs of February 2009 many nice hotels are up and running. A new seaside Malecon runs from the Main Road to the Southern End of Mahahual Pueblo. The Malecon is a pedestrian walkway with the beach to the east and businesses to the west. Many nice restaurants and shops line the Malecon.  The town now has several ATMs: one is in the \"Casitas\", a subdivision adjoining the port, at the Mobius internet\/DVD rental store; another is located at Luna De Plata, a kilometer south of the pueblo; a third is an HSBC bank ATM within the town's only Pemex station, 4 kilometers west on the main access road. Cash is still the best option as many times the ATM machines do not work or are out of cash.\n\nIf you are looking for quiet tranquil beaches, away from the crowds, drive through Mahahual and continue some 4 kilometers along the coastal road. After passing the small bridge of Rio Bermejo (hardly a river, more a small stream connecting the mangrove waters with the ocean) you will find small ecological hotels, restaurants and rental houses, all beachfront. Electricity is generated with solar panels, wind mills and most of the businesses use a generator as a back up. Rain water is captured on roof decks and collected in systerns used tio shower and flushing toilets. \nWhen you arrive at km 12, there is a turn of to the right, take it to either return to Mahahual or continue to Xcalak. If you continue on the beach road, you will find lots of empty bays,only a few rental houses on the road side.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nOrganized tours are also available from a variety of companies.\n\nYou will not necessarily be over run with the tourists from the cruise ships, when they leave you have this sleepy town to yourself.  Things switch quickly from bustle to mellow.\n\nStaying just a few km outside of town will keep you from the majority of the cruise traffic.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nYour best bet is to rent a car.  Most travelers land in Cancun.  Get a car they are get ready for the drive down.  It will take over four hours but do not confuse this area with Cancun.  Four hours gets you to an entirely different world.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Beaches"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Puerto Angel Beach"]}," -"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Mayan ruins"]},"\n\nThere are several sites of Classical Period Mayan ruins close enough for a day-visit.
