Everything is for sale here, most of it of dubious legality. The city sits on one point of a triangular shaped smuggling operation. Home appliances and large goods come here via Panama, offloaded at the port of Puerto Bolivar. Gas, food and other subsidized goods come over the border from Chavez's Venezuela, using primarily Indian footpaths.\n\nA trip to the vast market is a must for any visitor, where everything from fake iPods, outdated American department store merchandise and Amazonian fruits are on offer.
