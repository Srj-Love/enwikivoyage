Mainpat is more or less popular because of Tibetan Refugees living there for the last four or five decades.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nMainpat was a group of 62 plateaus perched at 1100 m\/3200 ft. The road climbed 30km from base of the hill through forests of sal. The area was home to the Yadavs and tribes like Manjhi, Manjhwar, Kanwar and Pahadi Korwa, and more recently Tibetans.\n\nMainpat or locally known as 'Mini Tibet' is a hill station located on a plateau in Sarguja District of Chhattisgarh State.   Chhattisgarh is the most forested state of India. Mainpat was nothing more than a jungle where only a few local Indians dared to live. It was a beautiful landscape in a very isolated place.  The Tibetan people built huts which gradually developed to better houses where they live today. The condition of the roads remained in bad shape.  It has recently been renovated and is in great condition at least for now.\n\nRecently on the high-end resort has been opened by the tourism department of the state as well as mercury resort, which also lies nearby. This is one of the regions where the Indian Government has settled Tibetan Refugee’s graciously in 1963 in the wake of Chinese invasion of Tibet. Apart from the jungle tribal’s of the area...who are the aboriginals, there are 7 settlements in all numbering around 2000 with Tibetan Buddhist Monasteries in most of the Camps. \n\nMainpat is charming picturesque place atop a jungle plateau with many cultural and natural sites of interest.  Viewed from Mehta Point and Pharphatia,  the valley and hills of Mainpat offers beautiful water falls, like Tiger Point where tigers roam and Machali or Fish Point as the river here was known for a type of fish.  A strange sight includes the bouncing swap of Jaljali and charming Chota Jharanā tucked away in a pocket of jungle with a small waterfall with beautiful scenic views. Other notable sights are the beautiful Buddhist Temples on this remote jungle plateau and attractions such as Bageecha and Zalzala as well as much more… So there are plenty of inspiring adventures to be explored in this wild and remote Hill Station of Chhattisgarh.\n\nFor more information you should check out these guys running a Tibetan & Tribal tour joint all over Chhattisgarh called godotravellers who can be can found on facebook and website.\n\nMainpat is about 45 km by road from Ambikapur.
