Global Restaurant on Magburaka Road offers both local and international food for a very good price.  The waitresses are extremely friendly and appreciate the business and will often sit and chat with you throughout your visit.\n\nIf you're looking for a more familiar touch, you must go to The Clubhouse Bar, also on Magburaka Road.  This is a bar and restaurant operated by the charity Street Child of Sierra Leone.  All profits are used for Street Child projects across the country.  Whilst prices are expensive in comparison to other restaurants around Makeni, the food is very good and it is one of the few air conditioned buildings in Makeni.  At the Clubhouse you have the choice of sitting outside under one of two large awnings in the courtyard, or sit inside in the main area of the restaurant.  Most of the time, it is quiet enough that you will have full control over the television and AC, meaning that you can watch the news during your lunch or take in a football match with your friends.  It also has become a popular hangout area for young volunteers from abroad, so there is usually a very good vibe around the place.\n\nIn the centre of town, near the Clock Tower, there are several food stalls offering all kinds of food.  Popular choices are the bread and meat skewer stations.  You can buy a loaf of bread and 5 skewers of meat for about Le 6,000, or under Â£1, and make a delicious meat sandwich which will fill you up for hours.  There are also several fruit stalls offering seasonal produce throughout the day and night.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Makeni_Wusum.JPG"],["thumb"],["Wusum Hotel"]]},"\nMakeni has a few hotels\/guest houses which are above the general standard expected for a regional town.
