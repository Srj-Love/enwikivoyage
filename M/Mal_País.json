Once in Paquera, follow the signs on the roads that take you through Playa Tambor and Cóbano.  A 4x4 is highly recommended, as this route includes sections of dirt road through the mountains.\n\nThe drive ",{"type":"'''","value":["from the north"]}," (Liberia, Tamarindo, Nicoya, etc.) is quickest along Route 21, which is mostly (but not completely) paved heading all the way down to Paquera.  From there, follow the above directions.  During the dry season, the entire drive will take approximately four hours from Liberia airport, but plan to factor in a couple hours more during the rainy period.  Alternately there is a coastal route from the north, but this is not recommended as the road is all dirt and there are several rivers to ford. \n\nA small ",{"type":"'''","value":["airport"]}," in Tambor, less than an hour east of Mal País, services flights to and from San José.
