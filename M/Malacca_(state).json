Streets and homes are brightly decorated with colourful lightings and ornaments. \n\nDuring Chinese New Year which normally falls in the month of January or February, the chinese community will decorate their homes with brightly lit red lanterns and ornaments.

Jonker Walk is only available on Friday, Saturday and Sunday evenings from 6.00pm onwards.\n\nSome interesting places to see are the Zoo, and the Museum district where there is a particularly good (if small) history museum.

A row of stalls selling seafood cooked Malay-style located at the end of the road. Catch a Merlimau- or Muar-bound bus from Melaka Sentral and tell the conductor to let you off at \"Medan ikan bakar\".\n\nPengkalan Balak is located about 35 km north of Malacca City on the road to Port Dickson, Negeri Sembilan. It is located just next to Tanjung Bidara, Malacca's best stretch of beach. Getting is quite complicated - involving a drive to Masjid Tanah and then to Pengkalan Balak - and almost impossible by public transport.\n\n\"Satay Celup\" is unique to Melaka. These are meats, seafood and vegetables skewered on sticks and dunked into a nutty spicy sauce to boil and cook. The \"satay celup\" shops are only open in the evening.
