It has been famous for its bottled water since 1622. The town was the chosen location for the British government in case of evacuation from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]}," during WWII.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Know"]},"\n\nOn their first visit to Malvern, visitors can easily find themselves getting lost due to the number of places bearing the name 'Malvern'. This stems from the fact that the town of 'Malvern' is essentially a town surrounded by a collection of villages on the slopes of the Malvern Hills. These are known collectively as 'The Malverns' (as are the hills) and are listed as follows:\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Great Malvern"]}," is the main town and population centre with the Priory Church and High Street. It contains the main railway station and most of the civic amenities.\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Malvern Link"]}," is a smaller settlement to the north, lying along the main road to Worcester, also featuring a nice common and old Victorian architecture.\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Malvern Wells"]}," is a small village south of the town, famed for its spring water.\n",{"type":"'''","value":["West Malvern"]}," is the only part of the town on the western face of the hills and overlooks Herefordshire.\n",{"type":"'''","value":["North Malvern"]}," is a small village to the north of the town.\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Little Malvern"]}," is a small village to the south featuring a lovely church.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["History"]},"\n\nThe name Malvern probably comes from the ancient British language, with ",{"type":"''","value":["Mal-Bryn"]}," meaning 'Bare-Hill', the nearest modern equivalent being the Welsh moelfryn (bald hill). Iron Age tribes used the hills as a fortification, building a complex moat and trench network to guard their outposts, the remnants of which can still clearly be seen on British Camp. Little is known about the village until around 1075, when Benedictine monks began work on Malvern Priory. The village remained inconspicuous until the Victorian Age, when Malvern's famous waters, noted for centuries by locals by their purity, became of interest to experimenting doctors who began to advocate hydrotherapy in the waters as a cure for a wide variety of ailments. The resulting boom in medical tourism brought a great influx of wealth to the town, and the construction of a railway station in 1860 greatly increased the number of people visiting the area. Many of the prettiest and grandest buildings in the town date from this era, notably the former Great Western Railway Hotel, a grandiose building overlooking the railway station which now forms the main headquarters of the prestigious Malvern St James' College.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Malvern was also important as it became the base for many government scientists working on RADAR (many of the huts and installations are still intact around the town) and the Defence Research Agency (DRA) continued to have a presence (and a large radar dish) in Malvern until 1995. The British government were also to be evacuated to nearby Madresfield Court in the event of the German capture of London. More recently, Malvern has established itself as a scientific centre with the old Ministry of Defence sites being bought by Qinetiq, one of the world's largest scientific technology firms.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nMalvern is about 7 miles south-west of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Worcester (England)"],["Worcester"]]}," on the A449 road. It is close to Junction 7 of the M5 motorway.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\nMalvern is well served by trains from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Birmingham (England)"],["Birmingham"]]},", and south-west England.

The town prospered during the Victorian Railway boom with four stations running simultaneously up to the early sixties. Of these, two, Great Malvern Station (a Grade II listed building and worth a visit in itself) and Malvern Link Station remain open and very popular, serving the Cotswold line between Birmingham and Hereford.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["The Malvern Hills"]}," are the area's most obvious asset with the 425 m (1,394 ft) Worcestershire Beacon rising directly above the town of Great Malvern.

These include the scientists Charles Darwin and John Cockcroft, the writer C.S. Lewis, famous nurse Florence Nightingale, the house where Franklin D.

This is a 9-mile long range of hills, rising up to 425m above sea level at the summit of ",{"type":"''","value":["Worcestershire Beacon"]},". With around 100 miles of footpaths and bridleways criss-crossing the hills, this is a very popular area for walking and cycling.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nMalvern features a number of excellent pubs serving a wide variety of local ales and ciders, many of which are prize-winning.

The water is noted for its purity and was the source of the famous 'Malvern Water Cure' which contributed so much to the towns growth in the Victorian era.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nTo the north, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Worcester (England)"],["Worcester"]]}," is an historic city on the beautiful River Severn, beyond which lies the industrial heartland of England around ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Birmingham (England)"],["Birmingham"]]}," and the Black Country.\n\nTo the east, the Vale of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Evesham"]]}," stretches past the northern end of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cotswold Hills"]]}," while to the south lies the West Country and the cathedral town of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gloucester (England)"],["Gloucester"]]},".\n\nTo the west, arguably the prettiest direction to escape to, tourists will find the lovely little town of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ledbury"]]}," and the impressive medieval county town of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hereford"]]}," with its cathedral and situation on the River Wye.
