Humans have been visiting the cave for approximately four thousand years, although it was only discovered by Europeans in 1797.  Through 1816 the cave was mined for nitrates, used in gunpowder, but after the war of 1812 ended it was sold and cave tours became popular.

More than 130 species are regular inhabitants of the caves. These species are divided almost equally among three classes of cave life: obligate cave dwellers known as troglobites, facultative species which can complete their life cycle in or out of caves (troglophiles), and those that use caves for refuge (trogloxenes). The Park has cave species and biotic cave communities that are among the most diverse in the world. \nBecause of its diverse array of landscapes and habitats, the Park contains an extraordinary 1300 species of plants.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Imperial"],["janhigh =   43"],["febhigh =   49"],["marhigh =   60"],["aprhigh =   70"],["mayhigh =   78"],["junhigh =   84"],["julhigh =   88"],["aughigh =   86"],["sephigh =   81"],["octhigh =   71"],["novhigh =   59"],["dechigh =   48"],["janlow =   24"],["feblow =   27"],["marlow =   36"],["aprlow =   45"],["maylow =   52"],["junlow =   60"],["jullow =   64"],["auglow =   63"],["seplow =   57"],["octlow =   45"],["novlow =   38"],["declow =   28"],["janprecip =  3.8"],["febprecip =  4.1"],["marprecip =  5.2"],["aprprecip =  4.4"],["mayprecip =  5.1"],["junprecip =  4.3"],["julprecip =  4.7"],["augprecip =  3.6"],["sepprecip =  4.2"],["octprecip =  3.1"],["novprecip =  4.4"],["decprecip =  5.0"],["description = \n",{"type":"{{","value":[["ForecastNOAA"],["Mammoth Cave"],["37.19"],["-86.09"]]}]]},"\n\nKentucky has a moderate climate, characterized by warm, yet moist conditions.
