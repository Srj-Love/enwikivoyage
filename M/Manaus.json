Both of these regions are (sparsely)\ninhabited, so you will not be completely isolated from civilization. If you want to\nmake a trip to a reserve or a remote area, ask for a special expedition package and\nplan to pay much more and spend a few days for the transfer to and from the reserve.\nRio Negro is an area that is great for the jungle vegetation and for the lack of\nmosquitoes (due to the acidity of the river). Unfortunately, the lack of mosquitoes\nmeans there are a lot fewer animals that live there. The South of Rio Amazonas\nis a network of rivers, lakes and channels. There are mosquitoes and wildlife, however,\nthere are quite a lot of houses and farms—and thus\ncivilization is a lot more visible.

As well, many channels and rivers dry out. On the other hand,\nfishing is much easier since all fish concentrates in the remaining water basins. During\nthe wet season, it rains almost every day. When there is a storm, the amount of rain\nmay be overwhelming. Thus, if traveling in wet season, be prepared to get wet and not dry\nout until the end of your trip. During the\nseason the rivers and lakes rise several meters and many new channels are formed in\nthe flooded jungle. Temperature-wise, the weather is more bearable and only the\nhumidity will be a problem. The wet season lasts roughly January to July, with the\nbest time to visit the jungle May to August.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Equipment"]}]},"If you travel during the wet season, keep your important things like documents\nin (tested) waterproof bags\/containers. Cotton clothes let your skin breathe but there is\nno chance that they will ever get dry. Some people find nylon\/synthetic clothes to work well.\nLong sleeves and long pants are not 100% necessary but you will not regret wearing them.\nA flashlight is necessary for the night, as the jungle is pitch-black. A machete most probably\nwill not be required on short\/casual trips but is essential for longer expeditions.\nA lighter and a pocket knife are a good idea. The pocket knife is especially important since\nit can provide the only defense against the boa and the anaconda (indeed, attacks do occur).\nA mosquito repellent is most probably a very smart idea. It keeps other\nbugs away too and it reduces the risk of being infected by a disease-carrying insect.\nHowever, the number of mosquitoes in the jungle is not completely overwhelming, so for\nlonger expeditions you may consider getting used to them. Additionally, a good guide can show\nyou some natural repellents available in the jungle.\nSun block is needed especially during the dry season. Otherwise, keep your luggage to\nthe minimum.
