The majority of Manchester's hotel stock is in the two- to three-diamond range, although business travelers with expense accounts should consider the Bedford Village Inn, an excellent inn in suburban Bedford, N.H.\n\nTravelers with business downtown might consider the Hilton Garden Inn, immediately adjacent to the city's baseball stadium (rooms overlook the park, and home runs occasionally bounce off the hotel), or the Radisson Hotel Manchester, a popular place to hold conferences and meetings. (The Radisson is co-located with the Center of New Hampshire convention center).\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Bedford Village Inn"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/bedfordvillageinn.com\/index1.shtml"],["email="],["address=2 Olde Bedford Way"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 603 472-2001"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=Bedford.

Violent crime and property crime is rare, and even at night, visitors should feel safe in pretty much every area of the city.\n\nAlthough crime is not a problem in the city, one should not take leave of one's common sense either. The downtown area is largely safe at all hours, although there are areas of the center city and the West Side where traveling alone, on foot, at night might be inadvisable. Female visitors should take all customary precautions.\n\nManchester's main police station is located at 351 Chestnut Street.
