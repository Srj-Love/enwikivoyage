[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["TT Banner.jpg"]]},"\n\nManchu (ᠮᠠᠨᠵᡠ ᡤᠢᠰᡠᠨ) is the indigenous language of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Manchuria"]]},".  Until 1911, it was the official language of China under the Manchu-ruled Qing Dynasty (ᡩᠠᠢᠴᠢᠨᡤ ᡤᡠᠷᡠᠨ).  However, the language rapidly declined after the 1911 Xinhai Revolution where the Dynasty was overthrown.  The language was in decline even during the Dynasty as many Chinese migrated to Manchuria.  This process was accelerated by persecution against Manchus by Chinese Revolutionaries, persecution by the Japanese during the Manchukuo Era, and by the Cultural Revolution.  \nConsequently, even though there are about 10 million Manchus today, only about a million can speak the language and only about 70 can speak it natively.  Manchus mostly live in the Chinese provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning (and parts of Inner Mongolia).  The Xibe language spoken in Qapqal Xibe Autonomous Prefecture in Xinjiang is descended from Manchu and is therefore mutually intelligible.   \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Pronunciation guide"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Vowels"]},"\na=a\n\ne=e\n\ni=i\n\nu=u\n\nv or ū=uu\n\no=o\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Consonants"]},"\nb=b\n\nd=d\n\nc=ch\n\nf=f\n\ng=g\n\nh=h\n\nj=j\n\nk=k\n\nl=l\n\nm=m\n\nn=n\n\np=p\n\nr=r\n\ns=s\n\nx or š=sh\n\nt=t\n\nw=w\n\ny=y\n\nz=z\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Common diphthongs"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Phrase list"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Basics"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["Common signs"],["; OPEN : \n; CLOSED : \n; ENTRANCE : \n; EXIT : \n; PUSH : \n; PULL : \n; TOILET : \n; MEN : \n; WOMEN : \n; FORBIDDEN :"]]},"\n\n; Hello. : (",{"type":"''","value":["ᡥᠣᠵᠣ ᠨᠠ"]},") :  .
