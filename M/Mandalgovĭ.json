However, at one time the winter palace of Ögedei Khan, Genghis Khan's son, was located near the city, as well as the ruins of Sum Khuh Burd temple from the 10th century and ancient forts, tombs, and monasteries. Also outside of the city, there are large wild game animals such as ibex, Argali sheep, black-tail gazelles, and antelope.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh =  -11.3"],["febhigh =  -7.4"],["marhigh =  0.8"],["aprhigh =  10.9"],["mayhigh =  19.4"],["junhigh =  24.1"],["julhigh =  25.5"],["aughigh =  23.8"],["sephigh =  17.9"],["octhigh =  9.5"],["novhigh =  -2.0"],["dechigh =  -9.0"],["janlow =  -23.3"],["feblow =  -20.7"],["marlow =  -13.0"],["aprlow =  -4.2"],["maylow =  3.9"],["junlow =  10.0"],["jullow =  13.2"],["auglow =  11.3"],["seplow =  4.7"],["octlow =  -4.1"],["novlow =   -14.9"],["declow =   -21.4"],["janprecip =  4.0"],["febprecip =  1.4"],["marprecip =  1.8"],["aprprecip =  3.3"],["mayprecip =  10.5"],["junprecip =  24.6"],["julprecip =  39.8"],["augprecip =  43.0"],["sepprecip =  15.8"],["octprecip =  4.8"],["novprecip =  2.1"],["decprecip =  1.1"],["description = NOAA (1961-1990)"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThere are 2 buses a day that leave from the Dragon Center in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ulaanbaatar"]]}," to Mandalgovĭ, at 8am and 2pm.
