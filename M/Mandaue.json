It is generally recommended not to show off too much luxury in front of those people who have to work hard to earn their daily food and drinks. Those people are generally very friendly and helpful but precaution is recommended. Apart from the poor, there is a well established middle class and an extraordinary rich upper class that come mostly from present or former government representatives or business people.\n\nMost tourists tend to go to the upscale beach resorts on Mactan Island or Badian Island. Of course, price levels there are high but hotel rates are still cheaper than in most of the 4 to 5 star accommodations elsewhere in the world. They will have beautiful pool areas, nice restaurants, spas, cable channel TV, internet and all kind of luxury.\n\nBudget tourists and those who are looking for a more Filipino experience should go to the beautiful South where there are some very nice best value resorts surrounded by idyllic fisher villages. Price levels for food, drinks, watersports and trips there are generally much lower as less tourist went there in the past. Some of these resorts have beautiful coral reefs right in front of the resort - perfect for those who plan to go snorkeling or to make some easy dives in amazing coral reefs.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["National Shrine of St Joseph"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Jagobiao Spring"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Monkey Caves"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mandaue Presidencia"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ouano Wharf"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Rizal-Bonifacio Memorial Library"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mandaue Ecopark"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cemeteries"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" '''Cabancalan-Banilad Sinkholes"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["City Plaza"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Pahara Park"]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=The Orchard Cebu"],["url=http:\/\/www.theorchardcebu.com"],["email="],["address=A.S.
