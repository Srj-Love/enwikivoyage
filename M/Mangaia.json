[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Australia-oceania default banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Mangaia"]}," (traditionally known as Auau Enua, which means terraced) is the most southerly of the Cook Islands and the second largest, after Rarotonga. Geologists estimate the island is at least 18 million years old, making it the oldest in the Pacific. It rises 4750 m (15,600 ft) above the ocean floor and has a land area of 51.8 km2. It has a central volcanic plateau and, like many of the southern Cook Islands, it is surrounded by a high ring of cliffs of fossil coral 60 m (200 ft) high, known as the makatea. The highest point is Rangi-motia, 169 m above sea level, near the centre of the island. Lake Tiriara is a body of fresh water in the south. The population of Mangaia comprises about 700 people (2006). The capital is the village of Oneroa, on the west coast, containing about half the population. There are two more villages, Tamarua in the south and Ivirua in the northeast.\n\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By plane"]}," - Air Rarotonga ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.airrarotonga.com"]}," flies from Rarotonga to Mangaia 3-4 Times a week.

Be prepared to be delayed several days, don't count on a fixed departure and arrival, because it leaves when they're finished loading, the winds are good, the captain is sober and the number of octopuses in the harbour plus the number of coconuts in muri equals the stars seen at 11pm at night, no matter what they tell you when it is supposed to leave.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["By foot you'll see the most, but you need time."]},{"type":"*","value":["By motorbike ($20-25\/day) at the petrol station in Oneroa.
