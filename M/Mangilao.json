Located along a cliffline above the eastern edge of Guam, the campus has incredible views of the ocean and coastline below. The campus itself is pleasant to stroll about. A sidewalk also encricles much of the campus; from roughly 5pm until sundown, it's common to see many students and local residents running or walking along this path for exercise."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Guam"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["no Wikipedia link"]]}]
