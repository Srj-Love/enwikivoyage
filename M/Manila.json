A foreigner may be surprised that a local looks just like any Asian, but wears mostly T-shirt & jeans, can speak English, reads and writes in Roman text, and is not at home with chopsticks. Manila is known for being a city where the old meets the new. Here you'll find Spanish colonial churches, old-fashioned museums and neo-classical buildings versus modern shopping centers, stylish art museums and glass-stained skyscrapers. Its blend of urban development and historical heritage had made Manila's image unique and attractive. \n         \n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nFor over three centuries Manila was colonized and administered by ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Spain"]]}," which left an enduring architectural heritage throughout the Philippines, especially with respect to churches, forts and other colonial buildings which can still be seen in the ruins of Intramuros, built in the late 16th century. Manila began as a settlement on the banks of the Pasig River, and its name originates from \"Maynilad,\" referring to the mangrove plant known as ",{"type":"''","value":["nilad"]},", which was abundant in the area. Prior to the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, Manila was home to Muslim-Malays. In 1571, 50 years after Magellan's discovery of the islands, Spanish conquistador Miguel Lopez de Legazpi claimed the Philippines as a colony and established Manila as its capital. Manila was also briefly colonized by the British for two years.  Manila was also part of the Spanish East Indies until 1898, when the U.S. took over the Philippines after the Spanish-American War.\n\nManila was first sought by the Spaniards, then the Americans. The Spaniards wanted a counterbalance to the expanding Portuguese empire which had almost taken a big slice of the pie in the lucrative Spice Trade. They got it through Manila, so strategically placed between China together with the rest of Asia, and Mexico - the next closest transit point for goods onwards from Asia to Europe.\n\nIts location seemed a well thought out choice. Legazpi took five years after arriving in the Philippines and settling in Cebu in 1565 to mull over before deciding to finally move up north to Manila in 1571 and make it the capital of the new territory. By numbers, it shortened the traveling distance to the other side of the empire in Acapulco. Manila is also in a much easy and straighter drafting reach for sailing ships to catch the Pacific Trade Winds as they blow northeastward to Japan for Acapulco and blow precisely at San Bernardino Strait for the westward-bound return trip without being diverted any farther. Most importantly, Manila is much closer than Cebu to China.\n\nWhen Mexico pushed for its independence from Spain and finally shoved her out, the Philippines' glittering importance began to dwindle due to the discontinuance of the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade, cutting off the Acapulco to Vera Cruz segment and it accelerated more when the Suez Canal was opened enabling the Chinese exports to go in the opposite direction and making Singapore the most important transit hub to Europe in the region. A token administration was just maintained in Manila which confined it to the doldrums being one of the unreachable and hard to maintain colonies of Spain. Until a new imperialist era dawned, emboldened countries embarked on a new competition for raw materials and market.\n\nNetherlands, Britain, & France were already there now with Germany, lurking somewhere and fit to fill in the voids about to be vacated by waning superpowers. Germany was already sniffing its way around the Pacific Ocean like a shark smelling a kill when the US, spurred by the windfall of acquiring Hawaii and which desperately wanted a toehold in Asia for her trade, notably with Japan and China, grabbed the first opportunity of coveting the Philippines. The Philippines once more, so strategically placed as the soon-to-be-linchpin of American imperialism extended her colonial servitude to the US.\n\nWith the dynamic geo-politics working, the Philippines and Manila in particular prove to be manna from heaven as Japan begins to flex her muscles. The result, the Philippines served as first line of defense for Australia and the mainland US to buy time and it really proves more beneficial as another realignment was in force after World War II when communism comes into the scene and is threatening to swallow the whole of East Asia except Japan, putting the Philippines as a buffer zone for whatever adverse contingency and as long as the Manila leadership sides with the US, things will be OK.\n\nNow that communism is under control and every country on both sides of the Pacific seemed to be embracing free market economy, all of Southeast Asia are grinding strong and busy buzzing. The factors of time, location, and distance are not a consideration anymore and what needs to be important is that Manila is as peaceful, orderly, productive, and creative as all her neighbors to win visitors' attention.\n\nBeing a city with its ears and antennae acutely tuned in to American and some European trends, and in the forefront of modernization and constant cultural refinement more than any other city in Southeast Asia or Asia as a whole, Manila witnessed or hosted innovations - political, cultural, civic etc.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Orientation"]},"\nManila sits on an archipelago just at the edge of the Asian continent, some 14° 35' N, 121º 00 E'.

What more, it lies in the path of the tropical monsoon bringing those more and more powerful typhoons during the second half of the year. It is fringed to the south by the idyllic Lake Bai - a veritable scenic showcase of Hispanized native folk and traditional culture, and farther south by cool and refreshing Lake Taal.\n\nThe City of Manila is in the western part of Metro Manila.

A tertiary education is not complete unless one takes the whole course and must at least have basic conversation skills. Now, Spanish is practically dead, but the language has somehow percolated through the Filipino vocabulary which is now about 10% Spanish derived.\n\nFilipino being 100% based from Tagalog grammar and more or less 50% from Tagalog vocabulary, is a hodge podge of other Philippine languages, setting aside English, Spanish, Malay, Sanskrit, Arabic, & Chinese. Here are the main ones that one might detect being spoken by neighbors or seatmates, Manila, being the Tower of Babel and melting pot of the country.\n\nManila's economic growth has attracted people from provinces with a delusion that a better life can be attained in the city, these people had brought a diversity in Manila's culture from their hometowns with tongues that speka Ilocano from the Ilocos regions, Pampango from Pampanga, Bicolano from the Bicol Region, Hiligaynon from Western Visayas, Cebuano from Cebu and Waray from Leyte and Samar.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Taglish"]}," has been part of everyday life of Manilans as they try to grapple with expressing themselves the easiest and the most effective way, mix n' matching English words and phrases with Tagalog and vice versa.

It so happened that being \"foreign\", \"western\", and \"American\", they are more endeared and adorable to the grounded natives, their way of speaking becoming the \"in\" thing.

Food is trained to have only one dominant flavor - either the bitterness, the sweetness, the sourness, or the saltiness is enhanced. For some reason, the ingredients used don't have that wide range like those in Malaysia, Vietnam or Thailand, its closest neighbors. Filipinos are just as happy and contented to limit their range of ingredients, a people that never had a royalty. Practically all countries that had\/have a monarchy developed their superior palate taste through the royal court. No particular doting attention is given no more than it fills the stomach of the ordinary hungry person.\n\nIn a close comparison on a vegetable & spice market tour between the Philippines and Vietnam, the Philippine counterpart is limited. For seasoning, Filipino dishes do not digress from the daily triumvirate of garlic, onion, and tomatoes, sometimes ginger. No cinnamon, anise, or cardamom. On the herb section, only parsley, spring onion, and lemon grass are popularly known to Filipinos, while in Vietnam, there are so many kinds of herbs used in the daily diet. One glaring observation, basil is not eaten fresh, only as seasoning sold as dry as a dead leaf. As a side note, the saw-leaf herb which is an everyday ingredient in Vietnam which happened to originate in Mexico, ironically skipped the Philippines during the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade.\n\nSpeaking of Acapulco, Mexicans drink tamarind as a beverage. Tamarind juice coming from the tamarind fruit, being as Asian as rice, is surpisingly absent in the Philippine beverage menu even though it is popular in Latin America and the rest of the Southeast Asian countries. However, it is used in a tamarind soup called ",{"type":"''","value":["sinigang"]}," in some areas of the city.\n\nNoodle varieties are limited to a handful. Rice wrappers for spring roll is just one type, unlike in Vietnam. Having plenty of variation and versatility for example, the Vietnamese would use rice as sesamed crackers, or Mexicans would make their corn into taco shells, or Indians would use wheat as poppadoms.\n\nFilipino food is safe to say more as a comfort food, a peasant food concocted at a time when all Filipinos were all living on agricultural-fishing existence, contented to eat simply on rice and one or two-dish meal - one dry and the other wet or soupy. Even if Filipinos have attained a higher degree of sophistication, the same ingredients are used and the same flavor is maintained.\n\nMost sit-down and casual dining restaurants in Manila would fall under the mid-range category. But there are budget ones as well. For budget dining, just follow the office workers making a beeline to building basements, canteens, or carinderias (road side stalls) during lunchbreak almost everywhere in the city and even in high class Makati area. The men usually wear short sleeved Barong Tagalog and the ladies, like bank teller attires. These are not lowly workers but they pay lunch as cheap as US$1.00 complete with a clear broth, a dish, and a cup of rice enough to energize the office worker for the rest of the day. University canteens open to the public offer student meals and have resident nutritionists too. Along Recto and Nicanor Reyes Sts., the epicenter of downtown university belt cosmos, there are dime a dozen shops that offer complete and filling budget meals as low as ₱35 or US$0.80 (80 cents).\n\nManila as a national hub of regional cooking, has almost all its regions represented in eating establishments either exclusively or featured with the others. General restaurants, either catering for the working class or the elite, can offer varied dishes coming from every region and have assimilated in every one's palette taste. For example the northern region called Ilocos has its favorite fare called ",{"type":"'''","value":["Pinakbet"]}," approved by practically everyone and has melted in every local's daily diet although it still sticks to be identified as an Ilocano fare.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Regional Dishes"]},"\n\nThe following are the regional dishes that have assimiliated into the restaurants, canteens, and carinderias in Manila.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Northern Luzon Island Region or Ilocos (Ilocano)"]}," - Ilocanos are know industrious and thrifty brought about by the origina people who lived in limited cultivable strip of land bounded between the sea and the Cordillera mountain range."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":["Pinakbet - vegetable dish seasoned with fermented fish"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":["Papaetan - tripe seasoned with bile secretion"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":["Dinengdeng -"]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Central Luzon Island Region (Kapampangan)"]}," - Pampagueños lead in the art of cooking combining the best of Spanish and Chinese legacies."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":["Relleno - stuffed fish or chicken"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":["Pastel -"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":["Cocido -"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":["Pansit Palabok - noodle dish"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":["They also excel in fine desserts:"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":["Turon de Casuy"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":["Mazapan"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":["Leche Flan"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":["Biscochos Borrachos"]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Central Luzon Island Region or Tagalog (Tagalog)"]}," - Tagalogs are generally good cooks too."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":["Adobo - now considered as National Dish, it's pork, beef, or chicken marinated in soy sauce and vinegar."]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":["Sinigang - Philippines answer to Tom Yam, a meat, poultry, or seafood boiled in a variety of sour fruits (guava, ginger lily fruit, ",{"type":"''","value":["santol"]},", in many cases, tamarind,etc.).

They are scattered mostly around the working districts of Sampaloc, Santa Mesa, Quiapo and even the tourist belt areas of Ermita and Malate.

It's mostly working class men and those working in the military and police establishments who are the clientele with young sexy and provocatively dressed waitresses or euphemistically called GROs or Guest Relations Officers serving the customers. Some beer gardens take it up a level higher and have entertainment on the sides with scantily two-piece suit dancers taking turns on the stage. The kind of food served somewhat resemble the Spanish Tapas style ranging from the simple such as peanuts, corn, and peas - boiled or deep fried to mundane such as fried pork, beef, chicken to the adventurous such as other body parts - ears, gizzards, livers, hearts, intestines, brains, balls, blood, and what have you.

Standard working time varies, especially with the proliferation of Call Centers, but the usual working hours are 8AM-5PM. Given that the traffic within the Manila escalates exponentially as the day begins, it's always better to leave early for meetings.\n\nThere is also a local saying known as \"Filipino Time\" wherein it was expected that the attendee would be late by up to one hour. However, this has been significantly reduced through the years, although the bad traffic is usually (and realistically) cited as the main cause for missing one's appointment.\n\nMakati City is the country's main CBD, or Central Business District, and, on every given weekday, it seems that all roads lead here. Multinational firms and big businesses hold offices here.\n\nOrtigas Center, which cuts across the borders of Mandaluyong City, Pasig City and Quezon City, seems to be the alternative CBD, with companies such as the Asian Development Bank headquarters and the World Bank Manila office located in this vicinity.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"''","value":["Check for hotel listings in the appropriate ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Districts"],["districts"]]}]},"\n\nYou can sleep in a Manila Hotel for as cheap as 500 peso per night if you wish.

Most of these accommodations can be found within Roxas Boulevard overlooking Manila Bay, or in the districts of Ermita and Malate. Manila's hotel accommodations are 20 to 30 minutes away from the international and domestic airport.\n\nThere are many major international hotel chains which have a presence in Metro Manila.

A stay in these hotels however, would be considered a luxury by Philippine standards particularly since the cost is a month's income for some Filipinos.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\nPayphones are very common in the city center.  The use of mobile phones is also very extensive.  To use your mobile phone, it has to be at least a dualband GSM phone.

It is very scary if not annoying encountering lolling group of male adult and teenage bystanders, although nowadays, these areas are most likely manned by village watchmen and everyone is more than willing to help and interact with lost strangers.\n\nNuisances that impedes a pleasurable walking tour are dirty and malnourished children who freely use the streets as their playground, manholes that were left open (or probably its cover stolen to be sold as metal scrap), dog feces, uncollected garbage, undisciplined cars and mostly jeepneys weaving in and out of the lanes as they pick up passengers, as well as political billboards.\n\nA popular scam as of recent days is for someone to approach you and pretend they recognize you. They will say they work at your hotel (such as room service or security) and that they know you from there. They then say it is their day off and since they just happened to bump into you they want to show you something nice that is nearby. They may be very convincing even to experienced travelers. It is always a scam.\n\nAnother popular scam is for a con artist to befriend a tourist and offer to show them around, hang out, etc. After gaining the tourist's trust, the con artist then slips drugs into the tourist's food or drinks. The con artist then leads the drugged, groggy victim to an ATM and watches while he\/she enters her pin.

Of course, if you ask them which hotel they will not be able to answer. They are best fended off if you just ignore them. If they persist, say, \"Are you going to leave me alone or should I call the police?\" That makes them leave quickly.\n\nTheft is common, especially pick pocketing. You should act cautiously as you would in any other poor country, especially considering if you do not look Filipino. Thieves and scam artists are likely to see you as an easy target. However, most travelers from other Asian nations, especially from southeast Asia, should have no problem blending in with the crowd.\n\nNever wear valuable jewelry or anything else to broadcast your wealth.
