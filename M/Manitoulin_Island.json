It is the largest fresh water island in the world.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["History"]},"\nManitoulin means \"spirit island\" in the Ojibwe language.  The island remains a sacred place for the natives although they have had their share of troubles.    The first to settle on the island was a French Jesuit priest named Joseph Poncet who set up a mission in the mid 17th century.  His stay did not last long since the Iroquois drove he and other visitors away.  The island was burned by the Natives in order to purify the land once again.  \n\nNative people returned to the land once it was set aside as a refuge for them.  A Roman Catholic mission was set up in 1838 and less than a decade later it was taken over by the Jesuits.  In 1845 the treaty opened up the island for settlement by non-natives.  The Wikwemikong chief refused the treaty and the reserve is to this day unceded.  An Ontario Historical Plaque is now on the grounds of the Assiginack Museum to honour Manitoulin Island’s place in Ontario’s heritage.  The Aboriginal culture on Manitoulin Island is still strong.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThere are two ways to get to Manitoulin Island: by car, or by boat. The swing bridge at Little Current, at the northeastern tip of the island, connects Manitoulin to Ontario's highway network. From there, it is a little less than 2 hours by car to Sudbury and almost six hours by car to Toronto. \n\nFrom mid-May to mid-October, a ferry called the MS Chi-Cheemaun ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ontarioferries.com\/chi\/english\/index.html"]}," travels from Tobermory to the village of South Baymouth, at the southeastern tip of the island.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThere are lots of cyclists on the Island but there are no trail systems (Trans Canada Trail).  Please ensure that safety procedures are taken as you will have to share the road with cars.  There are extensive back roads that are quieter and less traveled than the main highway roads.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nNumerous festivals, museums, special events and Pow Wows take place each year such as the Haweater Weekend in Little Current and the Wikwemikong Cultural Festival & Pow Wow, which features international Native Dance competitions, as well as local arts and crafts.
