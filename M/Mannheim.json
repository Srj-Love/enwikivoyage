It is best to navigate by \"following\" the blocks rather than the streets.  If you get lost, a rather high probability, simply ask a local.  They are used to it.\n\nMannheim was a small fishing village before it became a city at the beginning of the 17th century. It was constructed on the site of a fortress guarding the confluence of the rivers Rhine and Neckar. Even now a few remnants of the fortification can be seen, and the peculiar street layout owes to that part of its history. For 58 years, Mannheim served as a royal residence and gave Schiller, Lessing, Goethe and Mozart a home for some time. Before World War II Mannheim was a beautiful city, but was flattened in bomb raids due to its industrial significance. When it was time to rebuild the city, Mannheim, like many other German cities, opted for an all out modern approach to urban development. Thus, most of the old quarters were replaced by buildings typical of the 1950s. If you are not an adept to architecture, their appeal might not be easy to grasp. As a result, the impression is more of an industrial city with a few spots of beauty.\n\nModern Mannheim is the second biggest city in Baden-Württemberg and one of the hotspots of immigration. Because of that you'll encounter a lively and colorful mixture of nationalities and cultures in the city. The Mannheim\/Heidelberg area hosts the largest concentration of US military personnel in Germany, and barracks are found in many of the suburbs.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in and away"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nTransport from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Frankfurt airport"]]},", to Mannheim or neighboring ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ludwigshafen (Rhein)"],["Ludwigshafen"]]},", is by ICE high speed train (30 minutes, €25), or Lufthansa Airport Shuttle bus ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.lufthansa-airportbus.com\/"]}," (60 minutes, €35).
