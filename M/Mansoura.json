This Nile delta town is virtually unknown to tourists.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nThe easiest way to get to Mansoura, especially from Cairo or Alexandria, is by train. First class cars are usually not available, but second class cabins are air-conditioned and generally very clean and comfortable. Prices and times very. Check the Egypt Rail website for prices and schedules. If you prefer to take a bus, you can either take a \"Superjet\" bus from Cairo's El Ollaly station (9 LE) or from Alexandria's SeedyGaber Station (13 LE). The journey time is 2 hours from Cairo and 3.5 hours from Alexandria. Authentic scenes of rural Egypt can be seen on the way. If you really love saving money or want the true Egyptian experience, you can always take a microbus or Peugeot from any other city in the Delta.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nMansoura is divided into two main sections: Hai Gharbaya and Hai Sharqia. The most convenient way to get around is by taxi. Within each section, expect to pay 2-3 LE for most journeys. If travelling from one section to another, or during times of heavy traffic, expect to pay upwards of 5 LE. More passengers may also increase the price. Taxi meters are not used. To get a cab, flag one of the numerous maroon and white cars down at the roadside and shout \"tax.\" While most taxi drivers do speak at least some English, it's helpful to know the name of your destination in Arabic. Enjoy the ride.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nVisit \"Dar Ebn lokman\", the house of Louis IX of France during his capture in Mansoura.

Yoy can also take a look at \"PortSaid\" street, if you are looking for electric or household appliances."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nFood hygiene standards are somewhat lacking. Avoid all unsealed foods and you will avoid food poisoning. A variety of Western, and some local, fast food outlets serve food to the rich in the Gam'a (University) district of town. These provide familiar and safer food that is unlikely to be any less healthy than what the locals eat. Fat is added in enormous quantities to most local food.\nThere are great, clean and really fantastic fast food restaurants like; \nCookDoor, Mo'men, KFC, Dominos and Pizza Hut. All of them in the University district.\n\nYou may also try one of the local restaurants:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Fish Corner - offering seafood."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Green Corner cafe and restaurant - some English speaking staff."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Gardino Cafe."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Al-Khan -restaurant at the Gamaa district.

Be aware that in Mansoura, like most non-tourist Egyptian cities, alcoholic bevarages are uncommon except in hotels and a few restaurants.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nAccommodation is scarce. This is because tourism is not a local industry. There are a few hotels in town and they are known to all locals.

So, take care, mini skirts, shorts and skimpy tops will get you stared at twice as much as normal. Public drunkness is not welcomed by most of the conservative community. However, alcoholic beverages are accepted by the less strict Muslims or Christians and are available at the two main hotels and a few restaurants.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\nShould you need a copy centre for print outs and the like, look for them at the University District.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\nThe Gizirt El Ward Sports Club is where the upper classes of Mansoura spend their weekends. Again, just ask. It is known to everyone. The club is only worth visiting to get a better understanding of the culture and fashions. There is little to do there for the tourist. Entertainment venues are rare in Mansoura. Another activity could be a visit to an Ahwa (Cafe). This can be done more safely and with less hassle in Cairo however, where foreigners are not as much of a novelty.\n\nBe aware that transportation can be an inconvenience owing to Mansoura being very crowded.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Lower Egypt"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Mansoura, Egypt"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["31.05"],["31.383333333333"]]}]
