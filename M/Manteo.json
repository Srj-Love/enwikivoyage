Much of the fun in visiting Manteo, as with most of the Outer Banks, is visiting during the summer. Some of Manteo's staples run all year round, such as the Christmas Shop, but some of the attractions are seasonal, such as the Lost Colony performances. Manteo also provides some nice shopping and dining opportunities for those who are in other areas of the Outer Banks, such as neighboring Nags Head.\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nYou can use the Virginia Dare Trail, which is known to locals as the \"Beach Road,\" to get to Manteo from other parts of the Outer Banks, such as Nags Head or Kitty Hawk.

Family entertainment. Runs June-August on the north end of Roanoke Island. A few notable performers have passed through, including TV personality Andy Griffith and comedian\/actor Chris Elliot. It portrays the story of 117 men, women and children as they attempt to make a new home in an unfamiliar land, then disappear without a trace. The Lost Colony has remained one of history's greatest mysteries for more than 400 years. Director Drew Scott Harris has woven Paul Green's dream into a tapestry of Elizabethan England and the world the colonists found on Roanoke Island. "]},{"type":"*","value":[" Even if you can't get tickets for the lost colony show, have seen it time and again, or come off season, there is still plenty to see at the Fort Raleigh National Historical Site. There are lots of waling paths to walk on or ride bikes on that are very scenic and have various plaques containing historic information and informing you all about Roanoke's interesting history. Fans of history, nature, and bike riding will find a lot of things to enjoy. The Elizabethan gardens are very beautiful and are open year round (there is admission, but its a small price and quite worth it). Unless you are being active and doing things like bike riding or you are going to see the Lost Colony Show, it is not the best place to go with kids."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Downtown Manteo, also known as the waterfront, is another very beautiful and interesting sight to see. There is tons to do for everyone and a lot to see. There are lots of shops to see and you can find a lot of the local flavor as well as the tourist flavor in the stores that line the waterfront, with everything from bookstores to artisan shops to . Its a great place to walk and explore. There are also many restaurants with a range of prices and style. The Pioneer Theatre is a great place to go in the evening, and despite only playing one film every evening before rotating to a new film the next week, it has awesomely cheap prices for food and tickets and it is brimming with that family business hospitality that makes you feel like a welcome friend."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Roanoke Island Festival park is a great place to spend the day for families and adults alike. Directly adjacent across a small bridge from the waterfront, you can drive onto the small island or easily walk there from the waterfront. The Elizabethan ship replica is an interesting site to explore, and although finding out that you can explore the ship and then finding the ship which so notably decorates the waterfront's scenic view, asking information in the visitors center or even just a passing visitor can help you find it. It is not worth going out of the way for, and it does not take long to see, but it is much more part of the package of the Festival Park. There is a movie in a cool air conditioned theater that chronicles the lives of the Native Americans involved with the Roanoke settlement, and is quite enjoyable and interesting. It is like watching a professional movie, rather than an outdated documentary full of boring nothingness that one might expect. Next to the movie theater is a little museum that is worth seeing. It has a lot of interesting history and a lot for kids and adults to enjoy, and is very modern and attention keeping. Both are a great excuse to escape the heat of summer as well, as they are air conditioned."]},{"type":"*","value":[" There are also usually various art galleries and concerts over the summer months, Manteo also likes to celebrate the holidays by doing some event, such as an annual Christmas Tree lighting."]},{"type":"*","value":["Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge has over 150,000 acres of wetland habitats and a wide variety of wildlife, ranging from wood ducks and alligators to black bears and red wolves.
