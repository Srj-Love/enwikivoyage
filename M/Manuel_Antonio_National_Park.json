There are 352 species of birds, 109 species of mammals and 346 species of plants registered. The ocean has a great diversity of marine fauna. In the area often birds like toucans, pelicans, ospreys, kingfishers and cayenne bosral (",{"type":"''","value":["aramids cajaneus"]},") are observed. Iguanas, lizards and snakes are common. One of the most prominent mammals present are the raccoon, coati, agouti (",{"type":"''","value":["rodents"]},"), sloth, capuchin, squirrel and titi monkeys.

The fee is $10 per person (5000 CRC). It is only $2 if you can show your residence card. There is a limit of 600 allowed (simultaneous) visitors on weekdays and 800 on weekends, but this tends only to be a problem in the Easter week and the last week of the year.  At these times you might have to stand in queue and wait for someone to leave before you are let in if you arrive late.\n\nYou can also hire a guide to show you around and point out animals for $25 per person. They are required to speak English. It is worth the money, as some animals are right in front of you, but you do not see them until they are pointed out to you.  The guides carry lenses on tripods and you can see through them and even take pictures using a digital camera, traditional film cameras will not give a close up of the animal.\n\nNear Playa Manual Antonio beach are toilets, showers and changing rooms available. There are picnic tables, but an undisturbed  lunch is not guaranteed. There is a high probability that Capuchin monkeys will carefully observe your moves in a noisy way (do not feed the animals!!). On the beach, the monkeys are in competition with coatis: these animals are very photogenic but also very adept at stealing from unsuspecting sunbathers.\nIf you go to the park for a swim, take snorkeling equipment along. Playa Manuel Antonio is a great place for snorkeling as it has silky white sand and a beautiful coral reef.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Three-toed sloth cropped.jpeg"],["thumb"],["Three-toed sloth on a ",{"type":"''","value":["Cecropia insignis"]}," tree in the park"]]},"\nOnce close to Manuel Antonio, it is possible to walk from most hotels to the beach and to any restaurants\/attractions in between. There is a public bus route which will take along the one road to the beach to the hotels and restaurants that service the tourist trade.  Bus rides costs 285 colones (~$0.50) and may not accept US Dollars (will provide change).\n\nThere are no street lights, and no side walks to the hotels, so carry a flash light to walk along the road.  The park itself closes before dark, but walking between your hotels and restaurants will require a flashlight and in the raining season good quality shoes to avoid stepping in the mud and tripping over the rocks in the unpaved road.\n\nThere is a small field, at the entrance to the park, where one can park their car for a high fee, and buy a fruit or soda before one enters the park.  None are sold inside the park.  Be sure to pack your trash, and take it out with you.  The garbage barrels are few and far between and littering in the beautiful place is a mortal sin of a dozen major religions and over 50 minor ones.\n\nThe Parque Nacional de Manuel Antonio can be reached quite easily by foot, but at high tide a ferry is (often) required to reach it, costing a nominal fee. The intrepid traveler could, of course, ford the waters by swimming it, but help the local economy and pay for the boat ride.  At low tide the rives is 6 inches deep and 3 feet wide.\n\nDuring the summer of 2008, the entrance by the water was closed, and only the northern entrance was in use.  The water entrance was closed because a tourist died while crossing in the boat.  This is a 1\/2 mile hilly long walk over uneven rocky surface.  Shoes, not flip flops, are recommended.  If you enter the beach from this entrance, the nicest beach is the first one encounterd.  If you have to cross the water the nicest beach will  be the last one.\n\nAt low tide the river is a meter and half wide and 20 centimeters deep, at high tide it is significantly wider and deeper.  You would end up taking the boat. There are two row boats, 10 and 14 feet in length, and there is a small fee. There is another entrance that is a by passing the river, by the northern gate, but it is a significantly longer walk to the beaches.  The back entrance is where the tour guides end their tour.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Main Beach Manuel Antonio National Park Costa Rica.JPG"],["thumb"],["One of the beaches in the park"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["The beach"]},". The prettiest beach is the furthest from the park entrance by the cul-de-sac.  You enter the park and walk past two beaches in the national park until you make the turn to the left.  It is a white sand beach about ½ mile in length, in a small crescent.  The beach is about 40 feet from the jungle to the water.  The waves are gentle and the current is not strong.  The beach itself is free of trash and litter, as are most beaches in CR.  There is no life guard.\n\nOutside the National park there is another beach, which you will pass on the way to the National park, it is free to enter.  On this beach, one can rent chairs, surf and boogie boards, and purchase a massage.  The waves are significantly larger.  There is no life guard.\nThere are no life guards at these beaches and one swims at their own risk.  There are no marker buoys signaling how far it is safe for one to go.  There is not a dangerous current, as of summer 2007, at Manuel Antonio, but any person should familiarize them selves with how to swim out of a rip current when going to a new beach that has no life guard.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:White-faced Capuchin 1.jpeg"],["thumb"],["White-faced monkeys are often seen in the park."]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Hiking"]}," in the national park.
