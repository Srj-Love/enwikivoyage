It is now believed to be in excess of 310,000 making Manukau one of the fastest growing areas in New Zealand. It has welcomed more than 5,500 new residents each year since 1996. The Howick and Manurewa wards accounted for 60% of the growth, with the remainder spread evenly amongst the remaining wards.\n\nManukau's diverse population makes it unique.  It has over 55 different ethnic groups represented.  Manukau has the highest proportion of Pacific Island residents (25.6%) of any New Zealand city. In some cases, there are more Pacific Island residents living in Manukau than there are on the Pacific Islands that those residents originate from.\n\nAlso of interest is the age spread of Manukau's population.
