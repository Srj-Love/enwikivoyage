Downtown Manzini is very small and one can walk form one end to the next in 15 minutes. Getting to the residential areas such as Fairview or Ngwane Park is trickier. There are kombis that service these areas but the availability of public transport depends on how rich the neighbourhood is. The richer suburbs have no use for the public transport so it is unlikely that one would find a kombi from the city centre to such areas, it which case it is advisable to take a taxi. \n\nThese are relatively cheap for getting around the city. The taxis have no meters and they use fixed prices, so ask the driver before you get a ride how much it will cost, to avoid being swindled.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nGo dancing at the Why-Not disco\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Hlane Royal National Park"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Lobamba"]]}]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Swaziland"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Manzini"]]}]
