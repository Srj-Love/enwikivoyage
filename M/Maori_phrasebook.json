[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Welcome banner.jpg"]]},"\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Māori"]}," language (commonly: ",{"type":"''","value":["te reo"]},") is cherished by the indigenous people of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Zealand"]]},", the Māori, as a treasure (",{"type":"''","value":["taonga"]},") and many Pākehā (New Zealanders of \"European\" descent) are now trying to learn it. Although it is an official language of New Zealand, along with English and New Zealand Sign Language, few New Zealanders (and only a minority of Māori) can conduct a conversation in the Māori language. All indigenous Māori speakers are bilingual and converse in English at least equally competently.\n\nA number of Māori words have been adopted into everyday New Zealand conversation, even while speaking English, and many place names are of Māori origin. Being able to correctly pronounce Māori words is a valued skill since incorrectly pronounced Māori sounds like fingernails scratching on a blackboard and will immediately identify you as a visitor to the country (or a culturally ignorant local). Many New Zealanders have trouble with some Māori place names. Even a tolerable and halting attempt at the correct pronunciation is better than a poor guess – your effort to get it right will be appreciated and accepted.\n\nAs you might expect, one hundred and fifty years ago accents, vocabularies and word constructions were as variegated as the differences between Glaswegian and Cockney Englishes are today. With many people now having lost their localisations as well as their fluency, new learners are learning less localised and more homogeneous versions.\n\nAn exception to this process is the native language of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cook Islands"]]},", a completely self governing, tropical outlier of the Realm of New Zealand. Here the language is almost as different from the registers spoken in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Island"],["North"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South Island"],["South"]]}," islands of New Zealand as Chaucerian English is from Californian. That said, Cook Islanders seem to find it easier to understand \"mainland\" Te Reo Māori than the other way around.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Pronunciation guide"]},"\nThe ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Zealand"]]}," Māori language (Maori: ",{"type":"''","value":["Te Reo Māori"]},") is relatively simple to pronounce.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Vowels"]},"\nEach of the vowels has a long and short form:\n;short a : a as u in strut\n;long a : ā as a in palm\n;short e : e as e in dress\n;long e : ē as ea in pear\n;short i : i as y in happy\n;long i : ī as ee in feet\n;short o : o as o in north \n;long o : ō as ou in thought\n;short u : a shorter version of the long u sound, like the u in put\n;long u : ū as oo in goose. Never yoo as in many English words.\n\nThere are several vowel blends: ",{"type":"'''","value":["ae"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["ai"]}," (as ie in pie), ",{"type":"'''","value":["ao"]}," (as ou in mouth), ",{"type":"'''","value":["au"]}," (as oa in goat), ",{"type":"'''","value":["ei"]}," (as a in face), ",{"type":"'''","value":["oi"]}," (as oi in choice), ",{"type":"'''","value":["oe"]},", and ",{"type":"'''","value":["ou"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Macron usage"]},"\nIn written Māori, the long vowels are often denoted by macrons (bars over the letters) or whatever similar characters were available to the typesetter. Sometimes you will see words where a vowel letter is repeated, e.g. the Maori name for ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ird.govt.nz\/ Inland Revenue"]}," is ",{"type":"''","value":["Te Tari Taake"]}," (you can probably guess why they don't spell it ",{"type":"''","value":["Te Tari Tāke"]},"). This may indicate that the vowel is pronounced \"long\", but modern usage is to use the macron when possible.\n\nThus Māori, Maaori and Maori would all represent the same word; although you will rarely see it spelled \"Maaori\".\n\nMacrons have tended not to be written when a Māori word has been a commonly used word by people speaking English (including with the word Māori), and macrons have generally not appeared on direction signs or maps; however, as more people become aware of the correct pronunciation of various Māori words and place names, and of the instructive guidance that macrons provide by indicating how words should be pronounced, the use of macrons is increasing in New Zealand society, including in official documents. Some road direction signs for Taupō (both the town and the lake) are now written as Taupō; whereas, prior to 2008, the macron was always missing.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Consonants"]},"\nThere are ten consonants in te reo Māori: ",{"type":"'''","value":["h"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["k"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["m"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["n"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["p"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["r"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["t"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["w"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["wh"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["ng"]},".  The first eight are pronounced as in English, although the ",{"type":"'''","value":["r"]}," is said with a flap, like the beginning of a roll. It's not a long roll like the 'r's in Spanish.  If you imagine a roll is like a machine gun burst, then the flap is like a single shot from the same firearm. It starts like a roll does, but quickly moves on to the rest of the word.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["ng"]}," is pronounced as the ",{"type":"''","value":["ng"]}," in sing; it does not contain a hard g sound.\n\nIn most parts of the country, ",{"type":"'''","value":["wh"]}," is pronounced like an English ",{"type":"''","value":["f"]}," (as in feel or font or fin); however, there are dialectical differences. For some words, the Whanganui Iwi (tribe) pronounce ",{"type":"''","value":["wh"]}," (as you would for whale or where, with minimal breath expelled, so almost like the same sound as a ",{"type":"''","value":["w"]},"). The ",{"type":"''","value":["f"]}," sound is the usual pronunciation in most regions of the country, so stick with that unless you're told otherwise.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Syllables"]},"\nMāori words are broken into syllables which end with a ",{"type":"'''","value":["vowel"]},". Place names often consist of morphemes, or words which are combined to give a larger word, e.g. wai (water) and roa (long) are combined to give Wairoa. Try to recognise these morphemes (see the list of geographic expressions below) and pronounce the name by breaking it into its components.\n\nFor example:\n;",{"type":"'''","value":["Akatarawa"]}," : is said ",{"type":"''","value":["A ka ta ra wa"]},"\n;",{"type":"'''","value":["Māori"]}," : is said ",{"type":"''","value":["Maao-ri"]}," (Remember to have your tongue forward when you say the r, so that you make the flap sound).\n;",{"type":"'''","value":["Paraparaumu"]}," : is said ",{"type":"''","value":["Pa-ra-pa-rau-mu"]}," (commonly mispronounced ",{"type":"''","value":["Pa-ra-pa-ra-u-mu"]},")\n;",{"type":"'''","value":["Whangarei"]}," : is said ",{"type":"''","value":["Fa nga rei"]}," (Fa nga ray)\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Semantics"]},"\nMāori word root combinations tend to have a major root subject followed by qualifier suffixes.  This means a literal translation from Māori to English produces a lot of transposed word combinations.\n\nFor example:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Rotorua"]}," → ",{"type":"'''","value":["roto"]}," ⇒ ",{"type":"''","value":["lake"]},"  and ",{"type":"'''","value":["rua"]}," ⇒ ",{"type":"''","value":["two"]}," = ",{"type":"''","value":["two lakes"]}," (or perhaps second lake, as Ihenga discovered Rotoiti first)."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Kaimoana"]}," → ",{"type":"'''","value":["kai"]}," ⇒ ",{"type":"''","value":["food"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["moana"]}," ⇒ ",{"type":"''","value":["sea"]}," = ",{"type":"''","value":["seafood"]},"."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Phrase list"]},"\nAn ordinary traveller will not need to resort to speaking Māori to make themselves understood.

However, in recent years, there has been a trend for New Zealand English speakers to drop the English geographic qualifier and refer to many geographic features by their Māori names alone.  Thus, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mount Ruapehu"]]}," is often referred to simply as ",{"type":"''","value":["Ruapehu"]},".  In some cases, there has been a reversion to Māori names and outdated travel information may only use the old name.

In conversation you may hear phrases like ",{"type":"''","value":["the Waikato"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["the Manawatu"]},". In these cases the speaker is talking about either the river of that name or a district or region.
