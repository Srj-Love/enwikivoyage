Be warned however that the Goa bus service, while inexpensive, can also be crowded, and from some parts of the state (outside of the bigger cities) often very infrequent.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nMapusa, a small town, with a hillock at its northern extreme, can be easily accessed on foot. Two-wheeler motorcycle taxis will also not just take you around the place, but also help you find the address you're searching for.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nBesides the weekly colourful Friday Market, Mapusa is known for its educational institutions. It also has scenic (though not very famed) churches and temples. An alternative bookshop, the Other India Bookstore, is known to attract a number of tourists and visitors because of the wide range of off-the-beaten-track books that it stores.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Visit the weekly Friday Market."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Church out the Our Lady Of Miracles Church (an example of Catholic-Hindu amity during its feast time)."]},{"type":"*","value":[" See if the circus is visiting Mapusa when you're there (usually around Christmas)."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Visit the many 'sales' of low-end inexpensive items available in Mapusa."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Buy a plant or tree from the Friday Mapusa Market, keep Goa green."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Visit the century-old Athaide Municipal Library at Mapusa."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Taste Goan-style fast-food around the Alankar Cinema late evening, and in some locations within the market."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Squeeze your way into the Mapusa fish market, and see how locals buy their fish."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Traditional Goan items from the Mapusa Friday Market."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Tasty Goan spices from the Mapusa Market."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Typical Goan sweets from the many shops that dot the market area."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Traditional Goan bread from the special section within the Mapusa market."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Gold and silver jewellery from the line of shops at the entry to the market."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Books from the Other India Bookstore, an interesting place for pan-India alternate books."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nThis is the place to eat traditional Goan food, both prepared in the Catholic and Hindu styles.
