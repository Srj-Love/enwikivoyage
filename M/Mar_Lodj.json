It belongs to the district of Fimela, in the Fatick administrative region.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:MarLodjArbres.JPG"],["thumb"],["Mar Lodj Trees"]]},"\nMar Lodj (also spelled Mar Lothie) is the name of an island in the Saloum delta, as well as the largest village on the island.\n\nPeacefully protected near the mouth of the Sine-Saloum delta,\nhalf a day’s drive and a short pirogue ride from the commotion and noise of Dakar, the island\nof Mar Lodj is a calm and refreshing sanctuary. The local population, the perennially\nfriendly and laidback Sérères, live in the island’s three villages of Mar Lodj, Mar Soulou,\nand Mar Fafaco, as well as on the quaint island-within-an-island of Mar Wandié. Mar\nLodj, the largest, has a population of about 2000 and is the only village on the island to\nbe predominantly Catholic. Some ten campements and lodges spread along the island’s\nbeaches provide a range of accommodations.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:MarLodjVillage.JPG"],["thumb"],["Mar Lodj Village"]]}," \n\nThe travel season in Mar Lodj (and Senegal more generally) corresponds with the dry season, beginning in mid-October and continuing to early-June. This time of year is characterized by relatively little rainfall, lower humidity and milder temperatures. Temperatures range in the mid to high seventies. June through October constitute the wet season and see increased rainfall and rising temperatures, typically peaking in August and September.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nTravel to Mar Lodj can be organized through lodging establishments, by private car or through public transit options. The most common access point for Mar Lodj is the village of Ndangane Sambou; from there, the island is a short pirogue ride away. Wait around for the public shuttle boat (250FCFA) or hire a private one. \n\nTo reach the embarkation village of Ndangane Sambou from Dakar, take the highway N1 south through Mbour and then continue south on the Joal route. After Joal the road changes from asphalt to a red bush-road; the quality of the road after Joal is poor and can become impassable during the rainy season without a 4x4. Follow the signs in Samba Dia directing you to Fimela; continue past Ndangane Campement to the \"docks\" at Ndangane Sambou.\n\nAlternatively, take N1 (direction Kaolack) through Mbour to the Croisement Ndiosmone (between the towns of Thiadiaye and Tattaguine). Take the Route Ndiosmone-Djoffior-Ndangane south past Ndangane Campement to Ndangane Sambou. The Route Ndiosmone-Djoffior-Ndangane is horribly potholed asphalt; the red bush-road from Joal is preferable during the dry season.\n\nAn easy public transportation option exists as well. Catch the Ndangane Sambou mini-bus from the Garage Pompiers in Dakar (1900 FCFA per person + 500 FCFA max per bag). Make sure to arrive at the garage in the morning to be sure to catch the afternoon public shuttle boat once in Ndangane.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nWithin Mar Lodj\nThe distance between most of the lodging establishments on Mar Lodj and the village itself is fairly small; it is easy to walk or rent a horse-drawn cart. Taking a horse-drawn cart is the best option to reach the other villages on the island, which are in general farther away.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:MarLodjCampement.JPG"],["thumb"],["Campement"]]},"\nThe best way to explore and learn about the Sérères of Mar Lodj is from one of the local guides who, unfortunately at the time of writing, aren’t very organized or visible. Your campement should be able to put you in touch with one, or the guides are easy to find\nat the artisan ateliers where they sell their sand paintings in the village.

Although today traditional\nwrestling is a national phenomenon in Senegal, it is rooted in Sérère tradition. Every\nSérère village still regularly holds organized tournaments and supports their own local\nchampions. Mar Lodj’s annual wrestling competitions are held during a weekend in\nJanuary. Each village will have its own 3-day competition; call your accommodations\nprovider for exact dates and special lutte events.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nFishing\nMar Lodj and the Sine-Saloum delta are famous for the incredible fishing available\namong the mangrove-lined channels. Fish from the banks or hire a pirogue to take you\nout into the hidden mangrove channels.\n\nMany campements also arrange kayak trips, charette or horse-back tours, nature walks,\netc.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nThe national currency of Senegal is the CFA Franc. Along with the CFA, some locals also accept Euros. One Euro is permanently fixed at 650CFA, making the conversion simple.\n\nThe Grouppe Sassang is an NGO-initiated collection of three small businesses working to empower women in Mar Lodj by creating a small source of revenue in a sustainable manner. MarTex offers beautiful hand-designed and hand-dyed clothing and cloths. Mar Delices offers artisanally produced honey and locally-sourced fruit juices and jams. MarFoods offers whole chickens and dried or pickled shellfish items. \n\nIndividual artisans-cum-guides are also popular in Mar Lodj. A number of workshop-huts house their creative sand-art tableaux throughout the village. These artists create scenes of typical Mar Lodj imagery using un-dyed sand with glue made from baobab sap, both found naturally on the island. \n\nThe Mar Lodj women's artisanal market is located in an enclosure on the salt flat between the village and the river. Some hotels also offer their own souvenir shops. Souvenirs available for sale include handmade cloth dolls; wooden crafts; bead necklaces or other jewelry (some handmade).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nFor those looking for a good meal while on Mar Lodj, each campement has its own\nrestaurant, usually serving up a variation of local fare. Going beyond your own accommodations’ restaurant can add a little\nvariety to your trip. Most places prepare a set meal for the day (no menus here), but will\ntry to accommodate dinners’ preferences when possible. Just be sure to call beforehand to\ncheck availability as most campements are only staffed and supplied if they are expecting\nclients (many products have to be transported from the main land in advance).\nAnother option is the free-standing restaurant Black + White Chez Marie, located just\noff the salt flat to the north of the Women’s Antiquary Market. The advice to call ahead\nstands for this place as well; the restaurant is rarely open during the off-season or when\nno clients are expected.\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nAll hotel restaurants sell a limited selection of wine, beer and spirits.
