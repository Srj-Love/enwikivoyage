Usually after passing the Charallave-Santa Teresa exit (Caracas' suburbs at 32 km distance) the traffic tends to go easier. Try to avoid driving in the Caracas-Maracay direction on Fridays' afternoon, because this is the period where the highway tends to be more crowded by people trying to leave Caracas for the weekends.\n\nFrom Valencia to Maracay you should drive about 40 km east on the same ARC highway. This trip usually may take you about 30 to 40 minutes, but at rush-hour (5-8pm) it make take you two hours to reach Maracay.

The roads, especially to Choroni, are very narrow and windy and extreme caution should be taken if driving your own vehicle.
