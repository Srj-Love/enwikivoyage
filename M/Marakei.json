It has a population of 2,741 (2005 Census) and located north of Abaiang Island and 50 miles north of Tarawa, the capital of Kiribati. The main administrative centre is located at Rawannawi and serves as headquarter for schools, police services and clinics. The only government Junior Secondary School is also located at this village. Two causeways have also been constructed to join the island in a one ring shape and to give smooth access of any means of transport on the island. The flight to Marakei Island from takes around 15 minutes.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History, tradition and culture"]},"\nThe history of Marakei started off with the undated arrival of King Kirata who went there in search of his sister who married away to the island of Marakei. While there, he firstly initiated a term Te Katabwanin when he sent his bodyguards around the island to check whether there might be hindrances to face before searching for his sister. He sent two bodyguards; one went clockwise while the other went anti-clockwise. His bodyguard who went clockwise was found dead. From there, Te Katabwanin in an anticlockwise manner was started and noted until today that it is safe to do it in that manner. Then, followed by the arrival of the crews of Hernando de Grijalva’s vessel San Juan in 1857 that were known as the first discoverers of the island. Later, it was resided by white traders like Harry Holderson, John McCarthy, James Byrne and John Sandbergen. Labor traders also sighted Marakei Island and recruited some islanders to work as laborers in Guatemala. Then occupied by the Japanese in 1941 and liberated by the US forces in 1943.\n\nMarakei Island was traditionally ruled by the elderly men (unimwane) in the past. Following independence of Kiribati from the British colony, ruling system for the islands of Kiribati was restructured and then the Mayor (formerly known as Chief Councilor) was elected through a vote to work together in collaboration with the elderly men. These are the only people who can make and impose decision regarding the community. It is also part of the island’s culture that importance of family, respect of the elderly as well as guest hospitality are to be upheld. Participation in cultural practices as well as coming together under the maneaba to socialize and feast are also valuable elements of the island’s culture. The island’s economy is predominantly subsistence with copra and fisheries, the main source of islander’s earnings.\n\nThe islanders are very religious following the arrival of the churches on the islands. Predominantly, the Roman Catholic and the Protestant churches are the two major denominations on the island. Other religions include Church of Christ of Latter Day Saint (LDS), Church of God and Seventh Day Adventist.\n\nThe code of dressing is also another matter of concern on the island. It is culturally preferable that all women and men should use casual wear. Particularly, women are not allowed to walk around with bikins, mini skirts or shorts. A skirt\/short covered down to your knees or wrapped around sulus and T-shirts are preferable.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Traditional welcome for first time visitors"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Escorted around the island in an anti-clockwise manner known as Te Katabwanin"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Visit the four shrines of the Spiritual female guardians of the island namely Nei Reei, Nei Rotebenua, Nei Tangangau and Nei Nantekimam."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Visit other cultural and historical sites around Marakei"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Visitors should be prepared to leave gifts, especially sticks of tobacco at each of the shrines."]},"\nTraditional custom is to present gifts to spiritual guardians to assure good health and good fortune during your stay.
