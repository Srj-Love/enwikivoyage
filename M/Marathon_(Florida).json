These humps are loosely called seamounts, because they are like \nmountains rising from the ocean floor. Worldwide, there are thousands of these structures. \nSome are remnants of underwater volcanoes; others may have once been emergent \nislands. Wherever you find them, seamounts are unique marine habitats.\n\nThe Marathon Hump, originally called the West Hump, is 27 miles South East of Marathon \nand is one of the favorite fishing spots for charter boats and private boats.   This hump or \nmound rises from 1150 feet on the east side to 480 feet from the surface.  The Marathon \nHump is located almost exactly in the middle of the Gulf Stream where the current runs the \nhardest.  Large eddy currents form from the constant easterly flow of the Gulf stream, \nforcing bait to the surface.  This bait draws larger fish which draws larger fish and so on.  \nOn a good day, hundreds if not thousands of terns will be feeding over schooling Black Fin \nTuna and Dolphin crashing bait.  The feeding frenzy in turn attracts large numbers of sea \nbirds and is a perfect way to find the fish.  \n\nThe list of gamefish caught on the Hump includes dolphin, wahoo, blackfin tuna, huge \namberjack, blue marlin, sailfish, white marlin and big sharks, chiefly makos and great \nwhites. Fishing deep on the bottom, you might catch snowy grouper, queen snapper and a \nvariety of other bottom dwellers.  You just never know what you might hook out there but can \nalways sure that the Tuna and Bonita will always give you plenty of great light tackle action \nand everything else will just be icing on the cake.\n\nEach populations of different species of fish find its own comfort zone, according to depth \nand water temperature. In the case of the Hump, bottom dwellers prefer to stay close to \nrocky structure on the seamount, while tuna and bonito are normally seen on the fishfinder \nat about 100 to 200 feet down. Billfish and other pelagics, such as dolphin and wahoo can \nbe found anywhere in the water column.\n\nThe time-proven method for catching blackfin tuna on the Hump is to troll a combination of \nsmall artificials and skirted ballyhoo 150 yards behind the boat, at 7 to 8 knots. The captain \nlocates the crown of the Hump and then trolls into the current, oftentimes chasing diving \nbirds, and bait sprays, caused by blackfins chasing schools of flyingfish or other baits.\nModern techniques for catching blackfin tuna include anything from trolling large \ndeep-diving artificals, run straight from the rod, or on downriggers, to chumming with live \nbait.\n\nTo effectively chum with live bait, the captain runs upcurrent of the crown of the Hump, and \nthen as the bottom begins to rise, dumps several hundred live baits overboard. The \nschools of bait will dash beneath the boat, in an attempt to hide, but can be easily washed \nout by kicking an engine in gear. The tuna rise to the bait, and can be caught by \nsight-casting live bait on spinning tackle, or even using a fly. Many world-record blackfin \nhave been caught while anglers used live chum.\n\nPulling a big lure on the shot gun line is a good idea. Marlin, Makos, Wahoo and bigger \nYellowfin tuna, like eating Black Fins. They don't always want to play, but the hump is a \ngreat place to hook a fish of a life time. A few miles south of the hump is the wall. Here the \nwater drops to over 1000 feet. A great place to dust off those big marlin lures and see how \nthey work. If you find birds working, get ready for just about any pelagic you can imagine.\nHow to Get There\n\nHere are the GPS and loran coordinates for navigation to four productive seamounts off the Florida Keys. \nLatitude and longitude are in degrees, minutes and tenths, so set your GPS unit accordingly. The humps are \nfairly substantial bottom features, and slight aberrations in GPS or loran accuracy are easily remedied by \nkeeping an eye peeled for rips formed by current changes, birds feeding overhead and other boats working the \narea. A depthfinder will also prove useful.\n\nCoordinates given for the Key Largo Hump, listed below, are based on a rough midpoint; it's actually less of a \nhump and more of an \"S\" curve between 280 and 330 feet off French Reef.\n\nKey Largo Hump GPS: 25-00.661' N; 80-16.8'W Loran: 14133.7; 43217.8 Depth: 280-330 ft.\n\nIslamorada Hump GPS: 24-48.175' N; 80-26.674' W Loran: 14098.3; 43266.4 Depth: 294 ft.\n\n409 Hump GPS: 24-35.5' N; 80-35.5' W Loran: 14064.6; 43311.8 Depth: 409 ft.\n\nMarathon Hump (West Hump) GPS: 24-25.528' N; 80-45.328' W Loran: 14032.3; 43358.5 Depth: 516 ft.\nSource:\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nMarathon is not really a shopping mecca, however this may be the spot to look for marine, hardware, grocery and other travel needs.
