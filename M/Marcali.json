There are some people who understand German (traditionally the second language of the country). Few will understand English.\n\nHowever, most people will try to be helpful to a foreign-speaker.

There are also several bus runs that go south from Balatonmáriafürdő, the nearest train station.\n\nBefore December 2009, there was train service to the town, but the line between Balatonszentgyörgy and Somogyszob has since been discontinued.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nMostly this will be by private vehicle or foot.\n\nThere are several Kapos Volan bus runs that go up and down the main highway (71 to the north, 68 to the south) from the main bus station.\n\nA free shuttle operates between the city center and the Tesco Hypermarket on the north end.

(Most of these died in Polish concentration camps before the end of the war.)\n\nParks and fountains in the town are generally peaceful places to pass the time.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nThe main reason people go to Marcali is the City Spa and Leisure Center, located on the north end of town. Opened in 2003, the thermal baths were eventually developed into an indoor pool in 2008, and then finally into a full water park by June 2010. A Thermal Hotel was also planned for the site, but failed to open at the time that the water park opened, and remains an unfinished landmark behind the Spa and Leisure Center.\n\nBesides the swimming facilities, the center boasts also courts for tennis, handball, basketball, and beach volleyball. Although summer is the main time of year to visit the place, the facility is open all year around.\n\nIndeed, several events are hosted throughout the year at the Spa, including the annual Marcali Eurofolk Festival.\n\nCosts in 2012 were 1400 HUF for an adult dayticket, and 950 HUF for a dayticket for children under age 16.\n\nThe Marcali Kulturális Korzó (Múzeum köz 5) has exhibits related to Somogy county, and every other Friday hosts a film showing.
