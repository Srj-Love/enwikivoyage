While the Syriac population in Mardin dwindled due to emigration (nowadays Assyrians are more numerous in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sweden"]]}," than in all of Turkey), they are still very much present in the city, along with more or less all other regional cultures, including Turks, Kurds, and Arabs.\n\nMardin served as the capital of Turkic ",{"type":"''","value":["Artuqid"]}," dynasty between 12th and 15th centuries, which resulted in much of the Islamic heritage (",{"type":"''","value":["madrasah"]},"s and mosques) visible in the city today.\n\nUnofficially closed to tourism throughout 90's due to long lasting Turkey-PKK conflict in the surrounding countryside (and that possibly explains why it is omitted from most of the guidebooks to the area), Mardin has recently started to catch up with tourism (still don't expect hordes of package tourists, for sure), and rewards the intrepid traveller who took the effort to go there with a sense of discovery, along with plenty of beautiful architecture and vistas.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Orientation"]},"\nThe main street of old city, which traverses the town from one end to another through its centre, is called ",{"type":"'''","value":["1.

At the eastern end of the old town, it makes a sharp U-turn, and runs along the entire southern edge of city, making another U-turn at the western end of the town and thus completing a loop.\n\nWhile the maps and aerial photos of old city may look like a labyrinth, it is pretty hard to get lost in narrow alleys—depending on which side of main drag you are on, take downhill or uphill alleys you will come across one by one in a succession, and within 15 minutes at most, you will be back at main street.\n\nThe main avenue of the physically almost totally separated northern suburb of Yenişehir is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Vali Ozan Bulvarı"]},", which eventually turns into the street zigzaging on the side of the hill while climbing up to old city.
