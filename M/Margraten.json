Many of the graves have been adopted by locals, who attend to the white marble crosses and sometimes place flowers. The American president George W. Bush visited the Margraten cemetery in May 2005. Although visits by other Americans, both relatives and former army comrades of the deceased used to be common, the number of people that comes here has decreased heavily over time.\n\nThe town itself is part of the municipality of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Eijsden"]]},"-Margraten.
