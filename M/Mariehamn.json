Maria, consort of Tsar Alexander II of Russia gave the town her name.\n\nMariehamn grew up round the farming village of Övernäs, situated on a peninsula. The harbour's built-in sheltered bays came to be of great importance. The streets of Mariehamn are wide and straight. Housing sites were large from the beginning, but today they have been divided to provide space for several houses. A distinctive feature is the Esplanade, an avenue of lime trees stretching from west to east, from harbour to harbour.\n\nThe Russian heritage is mainly responsible for the layout of the town. It follows the same basic guidelines as can be found in many Russian cities, with large avenues with promenades in the middle of the street. Apart from that, the only Russian signs left from that era is the multitude of tombstones in the graveyards in Åland.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.finavia.fi\/airports\/airport_mariehamn Mariehamn airport"]}]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["MHQ"]]},") is just 3 km north of the city centre.

If the stop is at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Långnäs"]]},", there is usually a bus or taxi connection to Mariehamn, costing as much as the boat ticket. Tallink makes a stopover in Mariehamn on the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tallinn"]]}," - Stockholm route, though it is not permitted to use this route to go from Mariehamn to Stockholm. Viking, Silja and Tallink all use the same terminal in the Western port. The terminal is open 24 h. Tickets can be bought when a boat is due to leave. Facilities are limited. There are several lockers, a money exchange machine (EUR-SEK), toilets and a customs office. Just outside, there is a café and a small kebab restaurant. Birka Cruises have one daily departure from Stockholm, using their own terminal in the Western port, facing the Adlon hotel and pizza restaurant.\n\nFrom mainland Finland another alternative is to take the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.alandstrafiken.ax\/eng\/index.htm archipelago ferries"]}]}," hopping from island to island. If you are traveling this way, it is useful to have your own transportation such as a car or a bike. Depending on whether you take the northern or southern route you will land in either Vårdö (1 hour by car to Mariehamn) or Långnäs (1\/2 hour by car to Mariehamn). It's not cheaper or faster than the direct ferries but certainly more scenic. \n\nBoats going from central Stockholm are relatively slow, because they need to travel a long way through the narrow passages of Stockholm's archipelago. If you are in a hurry, take the line 676 bus from the Stockholm Eastern Station to Norrtälje, then 631\/631X to Kapellskär, and from there a Viking Line ferry to Mariehamn. Note that Norrtälje and Kapellskär are Stockholm suburbs, so no long-distance bus ticket has to be bought. Expect the trip to Kapellskär to take approx. 1 h 45 min and the total travel time from Stockholm to Mariehamn will take 4 hours as opposed to 6.\n\nPlease note that the sea can get pretty rough in the autumn. The Sea of Åland (the part of the Baltic you'll be travelling through) is infamous for its nauseating rolling waves.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe free local buses ceased operations in May 2013.
