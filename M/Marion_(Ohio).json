Entertainment abounds at the Palace with everything from current films to ballet, comedians to musicals, and everything in between.  Past performers to grace the Palace stage include Bill Cosby, America, Bobby Darin, The Lettermen, Bob Newhart, Art Garfunkel, and many others.  A full season each year brings a variety of options for all ages.  \nThis rare jewel's architecture is just as fascinating as the acts on stage.  The Palace Theatre is a must-see site in central Ohio and on the National Register of Historic Places.  With Spanish and Moorish influences, guests are transported into an outdoor courtyard.  The original 1928 cloud machine gives an open-air feel beneath a star-filled ceiling.  Eberson's masterful technique for the atmospheric style is on full display throughout the theatre.  \nWhile entertainment isn't a luxury, it can be luxorious.  And seeing a show at the Marion Palace Theatre proves it."]]}]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Learn"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["The Ohio State University at Marion"]},", 1465 Mount Vernon Ave., Tel: +1 740 389-OSUM or +1 614 292-9133, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.marion.ohio-state.edu\/"]},"."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Marion Technical College"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.mtc.edu\/"],["email="],["address=1467 Mount Vernon Ave"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +1 740 389-4636"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Tri-Rivers Career Center"]},", 2222 Marion-Mt.
