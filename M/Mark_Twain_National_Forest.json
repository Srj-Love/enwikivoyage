Lumber mills were commonplace, but by the 1920s they had disappeared, along with much of the state's native forests. Thus, in 1939 President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the MTNF into existence. In March 1933, he also created the Emergency Conservation Work Act, better known as the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). In the area that would later become Mark Twain National Forest, hundreds of young men at over fifty CCC sites worked at building roads and planting hundreds of acres of pine to preserve and enhance the natural resources of southern Missouri. Many of their contributions can still be visited and enjoyed today.\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Springfield-Branson National Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["SGF"]]},") ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.flyspringfield.com"]}," US Hwy 60 east Van Buren, Missouri or turn at Winona, Missouri on Highway 19 go north to Eminence  2 hours.
