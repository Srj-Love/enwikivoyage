A 8 day trek including guide, cook, mules, horsemen, tents, sleeping bags, and vegetarian dishes, can cost as low as 1000Rs (20$US) per day per person, up to 40$US. If you have time, do not go through an agency and hire your equipment from stores in Leh, and your guide\/cook\/mule\/horsemen from the Tibetan Refugee Camp. It will be much cheaper.\n\nForeigners are usually given a foreigner price and it is extremely hard to get the \"Indian price\" (ie 1000Rs per day per head) as quoted above. But with the number of agencies in Leh offering this trek, it is worth a try.\nChoose your agency carefully. Some agencies do not hesitate to leave trash behind - find an agency which will bring back the trash.\n\nIt is possible to do this trek entirely on your own without any equipment\/ ponies etc, by staying in homestays on the way however it is not recommended to do it solo. If you are alone, you can hire a \"guide\" by contacting any of the trekking agencies in Leh. These guides are mostly students who work as part time guides during tourist season for extra money. These guides charge Rs 800 per day (price as of June 2012). The cost of stay in homestay is Rs 500 (again as of June 2012) per night per trekker. It includes one night stay, dinner, breakfast next morning and a packed lunch for next day.You need not pay for guide's accommodation or food as homestay for guides is free.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["related"],["Ladakh"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Outlineitinerary"]]}]
