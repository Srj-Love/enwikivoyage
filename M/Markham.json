These bus routes typically have very good service frequencies, with buses coming at least every 15-20 minutes.  Though the first three routes stop running around 1AM, TTC route #53 has overnight service from 2AM to 5AM, coming every 30 minutes.  Rush hour frequencies are particularly good for this route (every 3-5 minutes), reflecting the fact that it is the 19th busiest TTC bus route out of 148.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Main Street Unionville"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.unionvilleinfo.com\/"],["email=info@unionvilleinfo.com"],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +1 905  477-0117"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Main Street, north of Highway 7.
