Like all parts of Aotearoa (New Zealand), Marlborough-Kaikoura was contested amongst various iwi (tribes). Of those tribes recognized as being in existence today, Marlborough-Kaikoura was a Rangitane, Ngāti Apa, Ngāti Kuia and Ngai Tahu stronghold up until the musket wars of 1806-1845 when invading iwi from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Taranaki"]]}," (Ngāti Toa, Ngāti Rarua, Ngāti Tama, Ngāti Kōata and Te Atiawa) used the musket against the defenders armed only with spears and clubs.  While Rangitane, Ngāti Apa, Ngāti Kuia and Ngai Tahu were to a greater or lesser extent routed, it is argued that conquest is only part of the customary land acquisition process and accordingly the defending iwi retained rights to the land. Even the nature of the customary relationships between tribes in boundary areas is disputed with one view being that fixed and determined boundary lines were a ",{"type":"<","value":["abbr",{"title":"European\/white"},["Pakeha"]]}," construct unknown to Māori.  \n\nToday all the iwi named above are recognized as having influence in Te Tau Ihu (the top of the South Island).  Ngai Tahu is recognized as having a sphere of influence emanating from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kaikoura"]]}," and points south.  Rangitane are recognized as having influence in the Wairau Valley. Ngāti Toa and Ngāti Rarua have shared influence over all of Marlborough-Kaikoura but especially concentrated on Port Underwood. Te Atiawa are recognized as having influence in Queen Charlotte Sound. Ngāti Apa retained influence in Port Gore and towards the West Coast. Ngāti Koata had influence on Rangitoto (D'Urville Is). Ngāti Kuia has influence in the inner Pelorus Sound, with Ngāti Tama having influence closer to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nelson (New Zealand)"],["Nelson"]]},".\n\nThe Crown went about purchasing and taking land which they wanted for settlers in the 1850s. Settlement continued apace. The first major industry of the region was flax and today, the remnants of the flax milling industry can be seen on the road between Spring Creek and Rarangi. Until the grape boom in the late 1980s, Marlborough sheep and beef farmers struggled with drought on stony country. The change to the historic province of Marlborough brought by grapes has been substantial.\n\nIn 1770, Captain Cook discovered the Kaikoura peninsula, believing it to be an island at first. Early European settlers used Kaikoura as a whaling station and the remains of pots used to render the whale blubber can be seen on the town foreshore.\n\nFollowing the 1989 local government reforms, the Marlborough District and Kaikoura District fell under the Nelson-Marlborough Regional Council. However three years later the regional council broke up and its functions were delegated to the district councils, becoming unitary authorities. The Kaikoura district however was too small to survive as a unitary authority and was transferred to the Canterbury Region.\n\nThe claim brought by Ngai Tahu against the historical actions of the Crown was controversially settled in the late 1990s. The Te Tau Ihu claim is being settled at present.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]}," \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By ferry"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Ferry in Tory Channel, Marlborough Sounds, New Zealand, 26th.
