Part of the Autumn Harvest Festival, held annually in late September. Cooking begins at 11 am, judging at 3 pm. A culinary competition in which chefs prepare dishes made from animals that are commonly found on the side of the road: turkey, opossum, squirrel, rabbit, groundhog, bear, deer, boar, elk, moose, rattlesnake, frog and turtle. Dishes are usually given unappetizing names, such as \"Turkey Gobble Vomit over Maggots\", \"Squirrel Scrotum Stew\" or \"Blood, Rocks and Guts over Snails and Maggots\". The cook-off started in 1991 as a joke, in a bid to increase tourism to the area, and although it has drawn criticism for playing on a negative stereotype of Appalachians, the contest attracts cooks from all over. Visitors can sample the results. There's also arts and crafts, an agricultural and homemaking show, mountain music and dancing, and regular food concessions."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Bull and Bear Restaurant"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone =+1 304 873-6633"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Open from 8am to 9pm, closed on Sun. and Mon"],["price="],["content=No debit or credit cards.
