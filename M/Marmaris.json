[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Marmaris banner.jpg"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Marmaris"]}," is a town in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Turkey"]]},", along the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mediterranean Turkey"],["Mediterranean"]]}," coast in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lycia"],["province of Muğla"]]},". It has around 28 000 inhabitants, however the population can be up to 250,000 during the height of the tourist-season.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nYou can get flights to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dalaman"]]},", the nearest regional airport which is 100 KM away from Marmaris. Coach transfers are 1 1\/2 hours. Airport is served by many operators such as thomsonfly, flythomascook, EasyJet and Turkish airline OnurAir. Transfers are easily arranged on-line and there are frequent bus connections which correspond to the arrival of domestic flights provided by Havas costing 25 TL single. (Havas bus tranfer times are detailed outside the airport terminal building). Tourists from the UK have to buy a Turkish multiple entry visa at the point of entry costing £10 (Bank of England Notes Only) which are valid for 180 days entry for visits of up to 90 days duration.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nCheapest way of getting around is using the dolmus minibuses. These are 11 seaters which travel the main road in Marmaris and Icmeler, the neighbouring resort. The fee is 2.00 TL anywhere in Marmaris and 2.50 TL between Icmeler and Marmaris. Marmaris dolmuses have a green band across them and orange for Icmeler. Other dolmus services serve Armutalan which is a suburb of Marmaris. The Armutalan dolmus has a blue band across them.\n\nYou can pick them up from the side of the road by hailing for them and they will stop wherever you want on the route.\n\nOther buses are frequently available and compete with dolmus services. They are slightly cheaper and are council owned buses which are similar in concept but slightly larger than dolmus minibuses.\n\nTaxis are also available on the meter or arranging prices up front but are very expensive (prices are negotiable).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Marmaris Castle.jpg"],["thumb"],["Marmaris Castle"]]},"\n\nThere's plenty to do in Marmaris. Busy beaches, lots of bars and restaurants, plenty of shopping with fabulous bargains if you don't mind wearing fake designer labels. Marmaris has a busy nightlife with a street devoted to dance music and all the high tech clubbing scene. Bar Street is opposite the busy bazaar and will satisfy the most discerning clubbers with it's huge outdoor dance venues and all of the latest tunes.\n\nMarmaris has lots for families too. Great inexpesive boat excursions can take you out round the bay and to neighbouring towns like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Icmeler"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Turunc"]]}," with all inclusive food and drinks all day for as little as 25 TL. Marmaris also has two water parks and local travel agents offer a range of trips to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dalyan"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fethiye"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pamukkale"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ephesus"]]}," and other popular locations in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Aegean Turkey"],["Western Turkey"]]},". Another worthwhile trip is to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mugla"]]},", the regional capital which can be reached by frequent bus service from Marmaris Bus station (Otogar) for 12 TL. Journey time over the mountains is about 1 hour and is well worth the effort as Mugla is a real Western Turkish town not affected greatly by tourism.\n\nThe town of Marmaris is not just for the package holiday visitor as a trip to the harbour area will confirm. There you can see ocean going yachts costing $10 million and rub shoulders with those who can blow $1000 on a pair of sunglasses in the exclusive upmarket designer harbour shopping area.\n\nMarmaris is primarily a resort that caters for British holidaymakers but recently has become popular with Russian and other Eastern European visitors.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Marmaris TURKEY.JPG"],["thumb"],["Sundecks in Marmaris"]]},"\n\nYou can have a ",{"type":"'''","value":["daily cruise"]}," taking you around the turquoise coves, mountainous shoreline, ruins of ancient cities, and a cave (the only entrance of which is from the sea) surrounding Marmaris with a stop at the beach of leafy ",{"type":"''","value":["Cennet Adası"]}," (\"Paradise Island\"—actually a peninsula officially named ",{"type":"''","value":["Yıldız"]},", however it does not have a connecting road to the rest of the mainland), which encloses the Bay of Marmaris. Just take one of yachts (which have a capacity of 20 people) which can be found all along the waterfront of city centre, you can easily recognize them by their boards and touts—who will try to convince you to take ",{"type":"''","value":["their"]}," tour, but basically all tours are the same. A tour doing the Bay in an anti-clockwise fashion (i.e. Turunç first, Paradise Island last) may be worthwhile to look for, as most tours ply around the Bay in clockwise direction, and thus you don't have to be with hundreds of others who took other boats all the time. Book or buy a seat at least one day beforehand. Such an excursion cost about 25 TL per person in Summer 2010 (including a meal). This type of cruise is good value but even better when offered with all-inclusive local drinks which can be expesive once on board a boat!\n\nMany of the local tour companies offer trips such as:\n\nJeep Safari - drive around mountains surrounding Marmaris and visit villages, waterfalls and picturesque beaches. A tour around the Peninsula of Bozburun to south of Marmaris usually combines a visit to the Kızkumu sandbar, see below, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Marmaris#Go next"],["\"get out\" section"]]}," for more information. Great value fun day out at about 25TL per person.\n\nTurkish baths - a traditional turkish bath (Hamam) with sauna, body peel, foam massage and oil massage. From 20TL perperson including transport to and from the baths.\n\nTurkish night - entertainment night with traditional Turkish food, dancing and entertainment including belly dancers. Many hotels do their own Turkish nights and prices range from 15-30TL for the buffet and entertainment.\n\nAlso, trips to further afield such as Dalyan turtle beach and mud baths, Pamukkale, Lycia etc.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\nLots of shops selling usual tourist fodder as well as local specialities such as Turkish Delight, carpets etc. Most of the branded clothing on offer is fake and is very cheap but the quality can be surprisingly good (Check sizes before committing to buy, especially when buying in markets). Beware of pirate DVDs and games as many will not work despite assurances from vendors. \n\nReal leather can be bought for a good price if you're prepared to haggle. Starting prices are normally at least 2-3 times the final price!\n\nHairdressing and beauty treatments are good value but beware of tattoo hygiene issues if you decide to be inked permanently. \n\nFor food, there is a large supermarket at the end of the main road before the harbour and marina called Tansas which stocks virtually everything including international brands. Tansas has a sister company caled Migros which has two stores in Marmaris, one at the harbour and another larger store on the main road close to the Marmaris Court building. Another hypermarket is situated on the main road beyond the suburb of Armutalan, Kipa is the Turkish division of Tesco and offers a huge range of international and own brand products at competitive prices.\n\nMost tourists enjoy visiting markets in both Marmaris (Armutalan) and Icmeler. The markets sell most of the same things the local shops stock but one can haggle a bit more. Beware of pickpockets in these places. The market in the Armutalan area of Marmaris is on a Thursday and the Icmeler market is every Wednesday.\n\nTortoises: Beware some unscrupulious Turks try to sell baby tortoises to tourists and encourage them to smuggle them back home in luggage as pets. They will die of course in aircraft holds and can be picked up by airport x-ray machines in hand baggage. It is an offence to attempt to import a tortoise into most EU states as they are an endangered species.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nMany places on the beachfront main road and just off it serving Turkish, English, Dutch and other nationality food. Tends to be cheaper away from the harbour and marina.\n\nNice restaurants are located on the beachfront promenade.\n\nProprietors will stand outside establishments and harass you into looking at their menu. Don't be too intimidated and a polite ",{"type":"''","value":["No thank you"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["Later"]}," will put them at bay. Marmaris and Armutalan councils have no tolerance for hassle and have special local police (Zabita) who videotape and close establishments who harass tourists. Most local establishments no longer hassle passing tourists.\n\nPrices are 5-8 TL for starters, 10-20 TL for entrees depending on establishment.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Money saving tips"]},": Many places will accept \"international\" Currencies ",{"type":"'''","value":["£$ € "]}," these curriences can gain you heavily discounted prices in certain restaurants such as a three course meal for £5 (please note Scottish notes not usually accepted)\n\nIf self catering visit the many supermarkets located in Marmaris the larger are ",{"type":"'''","value":["Tansas, Migros"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Tesco Kipa"]},".\n\nA bottle of water at a hotel can cost anything from 4-8 TL. A 8 litre bottle of water can be purchased here for 3 YL. Many of these supermarkets have in store bakeries which produce lovely fresh bread.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nLocal beer is served everywhere and is very good, called ",{"type":"'''","value":["Efes"]},". Another drink worth trying is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ayran"]}," which is a yogurt based drink. Very cooling and good for you.\n\nAlso, some establishments stock imported beers such as Becks, Budweiser or Fosters but tend to be more expensive. Wine is very expensive and seems to be all local. Good and common winery is Villa Doluca.\n\nOne of the local drinks provided by hotels as an alternative to fruit juice is called 'Tang'. It is manufactured by Kraft and is available in sachets which mixed with water make 1 litre of fruit drink. The sachets cost about 0.65 TL and when varous flavours are mixed make a very inexpesive and refreshing fruit drink.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Nightlife "]},"\nMarmaris is famous for its fantastic nightlife.\n\nFor pre partying drinks many small bars along the beachfront offer the perfect place to watch the warm sun set. \n\nThere are a selection of good clubs along the beachfront which play a variety of music and cater to different tastes. Turtle Bar is by far one of the best bars there, bar outside with nightclub inside, without the incredulous prices of Bar street.\n\nFor hardcore partiers Bar street is where the party's at. Located in the old town this street has over 100 bars and clubs ranging from rock bars to Club areena, a huge outdoor nightclub with foam parties. All are open to at least 4AM.\n\nBeware when drinking in Bar Street as prices are much higher (15-20TL for a spirit and mixer) than those along the beach front although entry to most clubs is free and there are periods when there are special offers available.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nLively hotels can be found generally in Marmaris City Centre\n\nMore laid back hotels can be found in the Armutalan area at the back of Marmaris where the local council has banned the playing of music after Midnight. Armutalan council has also banned live entertainment from bars limiting it to hotels.\n\nThere are exceptions however so make sure you choose a hotel that suits you.\n\nAs with any trip it is advisable to check websites such as trip advisor, for info on your hotel before you book as there can be great differences. All inclusive deals are good value but beware of bed and breakfast and half board as hotels may restrict you bringing food or drinks into their premises making you dependent on their offerings which will be much more expensive than buying from a supermarket. In a very hot climate like Turkey a few drinks each day can add a lot to a holiday cost. In self catering properties beware of damage charges. Soiled towels and bedding can cost up to 80TL to replace and damage to curtains and furnishings can be very costly. Note any damage however small on arrival and report it!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Ferries and high-speed hydrofoils depart several times a day to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rhodes"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Greece"]]}," but port charges are expensive.

It’s located on the western shore of the peninsula, near Orhaniye village. Story has it that a young lady started to spill the sand she gathered into her skirt, while escaping foreigners on one shore of the cove, and also to meet her lover who was waiting at the opposite shore. But the sand hadn’t lasted enough for the entire gap of the cove, so when her sand ran out, in order not to be caught by the foreigners chasing her, she committed a suicide by jumping into the water. Scientists have another explanation, though. Kızkumu’s length is about 1 km, and the sand (or more like reddish finely grained pebbles) is only one ankle under the water surface all along the road, also its width is more than enough for 5 people to walk side by side, so you can easily walk on the top of it (as many other people do). Its ending point is signed by an easily-visible Ionian column, so don’t worry.
