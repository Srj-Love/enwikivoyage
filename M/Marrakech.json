Its location and contrasting landscape has made it an enviable destination in Morocco.\n\nThe city is divided into two distinct parts: the Medina, the historical city, and the new European modern district called Gueliz or Ville Nouvelle. The Medina is full of intertwining narrow passageways and local shops full of character; it also contains the large square Jeema el fna, where many hotels are located and tourists, locals and vendors congregate.

On ATMs, check for the Maestro, Cirrus or Plus logos to be sure that the machine accepts foreign credit cards. Beware as some of the ATMs work only in French. If your card is taken at the ATM, tell airport security and they can help you get it back.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Airport transfers "]},"\n\nThe airport is located about 9km (6 miles) south-west of the city center (medina).\n\nThe No 19 Airport express bus is Dh 30 for a single trip or Dh 50 for round trip (if the return trip is within 2 weeks of initial purchase). It serves all the major hotels and is a great way to go from the airport to the hotels. You can easily find its departure stop, to the left of the road immediately outside of the Arrivals Hall at terminal 2, after the taxis. The bus leaves the airport every half an hour between 7AM and 9:30PM. The bus has no particular stops except Jeema El Fna and can stop anywhere on the route. The driver has a small map to hand out and you can tell the driver your hotel you're heading to.\nYou can also catch No 11 city bus which runs from M'Hamid district to the long distance bus station at Bab Doukkala, stopping also at Jeema El Fna. It stops on Avenue Gnassa - main road near airport, 500 meters from terminal. This is an option only for people without large, heavy luggage, but it is the cheapest one - the bus costs Dh 3.5\n\nThe airport is about a 10-15 min ride by \"petit taxi\" from the city center.  Petit taxis are hatchbacks that go to destinations within the city and charge a lower price than the larger \"grand taxis,\" which go between cities.  If you leave from the airport by petit taxi, make sure to agree on the price beforehand, or—better yet—have the driver use his meter (a taxi ride to Ville Nouvelle or to the Medina from the airport should be Dh 40-70, more at night).  In practice, most petit taxi drivers have agreed among themselves to an artificially high rate to or from the airport—most will quote you Dh 80 each way, and half again that much at night. As of late 2011, taxis appear now to be quoting a very over-inflated Dh 200 at night, and Dh 150 by day; trying to bargain a lower price is very difficult. They will try to charge even more (Dh 250-300) for groups. They can be very pushy and like to get you locked inside the vehicle before they reveal the price and will always demand the fare up front. Ideally you should try to pay no more than Dh 100 from the airport to the center of the city for a petit taxi, depending on the time of day and number of passengers. While it is possible to bargain with the airport taxis, in some cases they may agree a lower price (i.e. Dh 100) then stop mid journey and demand another Dh 100. Call the police if this happens. If you catch a petit taxi outside of airport, the petit taxi will use the meter instead of negotiated price.\n\nIf you are heading to the airport from the city, grand taxis are a very cheap option. Instead of taking taxi heading for the airport however, you should take one with the direction M'Hamid and ask to be dropped of at the airport exit on its route, from which it is only a 200-300 metre walk to the terminal. This option costs only Dh 5 per person, although you should make sure you agree on the price before you get in. Unfortunately, it is not possible to use this method from the airport to the city.\n\nIf you are traveling from the airport to somewhere further afield (such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Essaouira"]]},"), your hotel or guest house may be able to arrange a grand taxi to pick you up at the airport and charge a fixed price for the journey. Grands taxis are generally more expensive than petit taxis, but more comfortable especially when you have luggage. It also avoids hassle, as it's not always easy to haggle with a taxi driver after staggering off a long plane ride half-asleep.\n\nSeveral international ",{"type":"[[","value":[["renting a car"],["rental car"]]}," companies are based at the airport as well.\n\nIf you don't have too much luggage then it's possible to walk from the airport to the Medina even though it would take you from an hour and half to two hours. There is a footpath alongside the road all the way and the minaret of the Koutoubia mosque provides an excellent landmark to head towards. If you have enough time you can break the trip with a visit to the Menara gardens, which are between the airport and the city.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Marrakesh Train Station (6858199801).jpg"],["thumb"],["220px"],["Marrakech train station"]]},"\nThe train station is in the recently developed Guéliz district at Avenue Hassan II, ☎ +212 447768.

The night trains which leaves for Marrakech from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tangier"]]}," travels straight through to Marrakech without the need for a connection. The night trains do have sleeper cars on board, though you will need to pay extra for these if you want a bed (around Dh 350).  If you're planning to go cheap and take the night train on the regular seats in second class (and planning to sleep...), you'll be interrupted by movement of te passengers and a few times by the ticket conductors throughout the night. It's a great way to travel but don't plan on sleeping on the train, especially if you are travelling alone.\n\nThere is currently no train line further south than Marrakech in Morocco; if you want to head south, to the desert, Atlas Mountains, Agadir or Essaouira on the coast, you'll have to get a bus, rental car or grand taxi.\n\nMoroccan trains do not have restaurant cars. A snack trolley makes the rounds with sandwiches, soft drinks and coffee, but bringing some food for the journey isn't a bad idea. Stops in Casablanca and Rabat usually are long enough to grab a bite in the station en route.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nThere are many long distance bus companies operating within Morocco which serve Marrakech and other cities.\n\nThe recommended bus companies for tourists are ",{"type":"'''","value":["CTM"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["Pullman du sud"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Supratours"]},". Other companies do exist, though these three companies are usually your safest options.\n\nMost ALSA (local destination bus company) and private bus lines depart and arrive at the ",{"type":"'''","value":["long distance bus station"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["gare routière"]},") near Bab Doukkala, a 20 min walk (Dh 15 - 20 by ",{"type":"''","value":["petit taxi"]},") from Djemaa El-Fna. Supratours and Eurolines buses operate from here. It's the place to take the buses from the small companies, that go directly to small destinations.\n\nThe long distance bus station, CTM and private bus companies travel to destinations such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Agadir"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Safi"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Casablanca"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["El Jadida"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Essaouira"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fez"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Meknes"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ouarzazate"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rabat"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Taroudant"]]},". Taxi touts will often gather in the bus station to convince you that a bus to your destination is 'full' and to steer you into a grand taxi, and will attempt to sell you goods as your taxi is prepared. This can be difficult if there is nobody manning the ticket desks, and the best option is to walk out of the station to the coaches - a ticket can usually be purchased from a conductor on board.\nFor trips to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Meknes"]]}," (6h, ~120 Dh) be advised, that while seemingly shorter on the map, the mountain route via ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beni Millal"]]}," takes at least 2 hours more than on the highway via ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rabat"]]}," and Casa, going there by train (6½h, 174 Dh) is the most comfortable option, although busses might be slightly quicker.\n\nCTM operates a brand new bus station \"Gare Voyageurs\" one block south from the Supratour station next to the train station. It's better to take the buses there, because you can buy the tickets in advance. Besides, the CTM's offices there are better and there's no people trying to push you to their bus company. The office and station on Zerktouni street does not exist anymore. CTM has also an office at the long distance bus station (see above) if you just want to buy your tickets in advance or check the schedule.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Jemaaelfna-sign.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["The signs used on buildings"]]},"\nOnce in the medina, everything can be seen ",{"type":"'''","value":["on foot"]},", though you'll be doing a lot of walking.

It will cost you about Dh 70 at local supermarket for cooking oil or Dh 200 for genuine cosmetic oil.\n\nMarrakech is home to a large tanning industry, and leather goods of high quality can be bought here cheaply.

Look for boutique d'artisans. One is near Djemaa El-Fna while the other one is in the ville nouvelle.\n\nAn option to explore the souks in a more tranquil way is to go during the Friday prayer.

While locals drink it with no problems, visitors often find it hard to digest. To be safe, opt for bottled mineral water, available at the numerous marketplace kiosks and food stalls. Make sure that the cap seal has not been broken, since  vendors have been known to save money by refilling plastic bottles from the tap. At restaurants, ask for your drinks without ice, which are usually made with tap water.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Scams"]},"\n\nIf you look like a tourist, then it is common for people to offer to help with directions or even lead you to what you are looking for. Although not apparent at first, these people expect to be paid and will often lead you round in circles to increase the amount. Also, people may say that the place you are looking for is closed, but they will take you somewhere else that's better. This is almost always a lie. The best people to ask for directions are people behind a counter, as they cannot lead you because they don't want to leave their stall. If you are seriously lost, getting someone to lead you back is an option, but you should not give them more than Dh 10-20, no matter how much they complain.\n\nMoroccans are not permitted to be guides for foreigners without a license. Usually Police officers (under cover) are patrolling to catch Moroccans who are bothering tourists or try to make some money.\n\nThere are often people in Djemaa El-Fna offering ",{"type":"'''","value":["henna tattoos"]},", which are popular with locals and tourists alike. But among the many genuine traders are one or two scam artists. They appear very charming and trustworthy while you choose a design, but will then cleverly divert your attention. Before you know it, you have the beginnings of a rather poor henna tattoo. Even if you do not want a design, be sure to keep your hands away from them as they will grab your hand and begin a design anyway. The scam artist later demands massive payments, in whatever currency you have (dirhams or not). After emptying your pockets, if they consider you can afford more, they will demand that you visit a nearby ATM. Always agree on a firm price before work starts. If you can't do this, insist that the operator stops immediately - then go to another (hopefully more reliable) operator to get your design completed. If they say it is free before they start or while they are doing it, they will always ask for a price later on. If this happens to you, you can walk away without paying; however, they will harass you for a little before giving up and moving on to another tourist. Also, there have been stories of these scam artists using henna mixed with dangerous chemicals, such as PPD (this is sometimes done to make the tattoos appear black), which can cause skin damage or severe allergic reactions.\n\nSome tourists encounter an elderly lady offering henna in the main square - she welcomes you to her stall, and then fetches her friends (who arrive, usually, on motor bikes) and will provide you with very appealing tattoos - however, beware - they will not agree a price upfront and will ask for huge amounts - e.g. a 50Dh tattoo will be 450Dh - or they will promise you free tattoos and then charge equally large amounts. When you dispute the amount they will scream at you - so be calm, pay them what you think it is worth, and walk away. If they try to stop you then create attention - however, do not use physical violence as these artists work in gangs and before you know it you'll be surrounded by other con-artists.\n\nMost Moroccans are tourist-friendly and are not aggressive, so sometimes making a fuss in public can generate unwanted attention for a scam artist and shame them into backing off.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Embassies"]},"\n\nBe sure to report any crime to both the local police and your embassy.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=British Honorary Consulate in Marrakech"],["url="],["email="],["address=Résidence Taib\n55, Boulevard Zerktouni, Gueliz"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+ 212 5 2442 0846"],["tollfree="],["fax=+ 212 5 2443 5276"],["hours=M-F 8AM-1PM"],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\nMost other foreign embassies and consulates in Morocco are in Rabat, with a few more in Casablanca.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n\nThere are many dry cleaning shops inside and outside of the Medina.
