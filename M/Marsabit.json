There is increased rainfall here so the area is very green compared to the surrounding desert.  Marsabit National Reserve is meant to protect part of this forest and large herds of elephants can be seen around the crater lakes in the park--definitely worth seeing.  Also, short hikes from the center of town to the two hills with visible towers give panoramic views of the countryside.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Chicho"]}," is a new hotel that targets both foreign travellers and locals.
