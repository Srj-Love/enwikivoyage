It is rare as a Maltese seaside village in that it has no modern buildings such as hotels spoiling it and none of the traditional housing has as of yet been destroyed to make way for prefab rental apartments. On Sundays there is a fish market where one can get the best fish available, a particular local favourite is the Lampuki. The sight of the traditional luzzu's (fishingboats built according to a design dating back to the Phoenicians) and the tranquil surroundings make this a very pleasant place to have lunch at one of the quaiside restaurants. The only blemish on this near perfect picture is the powerplant that for some unfathomable reason had to be built on the side of the bay rather than out of sight in the next bay where the ultra modern cargo port is located.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\nThe Sunday fish market is said to be the best place in the country for fish, and is a lively traditional spectacle to see.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nOn the waterfront there are several reasonably decent restaurants where one can have lunch outside.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nAt the waterfront, one can drink in a suitablly beautiful location, surrounded by quaint boats and fishermen.
