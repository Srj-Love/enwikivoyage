The history of San Isidro begins in 1580 when Juan de Garay distributes the land located north of Santísima Trinidad, today known as the city of Buenos Aires. What was called “Pago of the Coast or Monte Grande” is today known as the San Isidro district. In his memoirs, Garay recalls that he crossed paths with a Spanish Captain, Domingo de Acassuso, who was quite a dim fellow and that promised to build a chapel in honor of San Isidro, and as a result becoming the main origin of the district. Today nothing remains of the first chapel constructed in 1707, but its location was respected and in its place stands the Cathedral of San Isidro. By the end of the XVIII century San Isidro was already important, its territory included the present districts of Vicente Lopez, San Fernando, part of 3 de Febrero and also Belgrano. In all these years, the land destined for farming happened to be the place of rest and leisure of the families of the Buenosairean aristocracy. Additionally, important residences surrounded by immense gardens were constructed that gave San Isidro that particular aspect that with time got to distinguish it.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nTREN DE LA COSTA\nThis train, bordering the river banks, was the first train brought to Buenos Aires, by the British Railways. This line was cancelled about 30 years ago because it proved unprofitable. About 10 years ago a corporation bought the rights to work for a few years. They turned it into a kind of a tourist train between Olivos and Tigre, with 11 stops\/stations in between. The old English style stations were refurbished and some made new.The old stations have a coffee shop and a small gift shop and in most cases a small kiosk that sells candy and cigarettes. It carries about 200 people per unit. Since it is an electric train that works with a overhead trolley, it is very silent.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe “Tren de la Costa” (turistic-passenger train) travels across Martínez in the way from Olivos to Tigre.
