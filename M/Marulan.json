[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Australia-oceania default banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Marulan"]}," is a small town in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales.  Squeezed between the Shoalhaven Gorge to the south, and the ranges to the north, just about every trip from Sydney heading south-west towards Melbourne or Canberra must pass through Marulan.  Even those taking the scenic country roads, must join the freeway for the short Marulan section.\n\nAs a result Marulan is well known as a rest stop on the Hume Highway.  It is the truckers milestone, and a Hungry Jacks services.  However, if you spend a extra sixty seconds to exit into the town, you'll find an attractive town centre, with a small park, cafe, and a curiosity shop.  Spend a little longer, and you can explore the gorges and hills that make the Marulan area an interesting natural location.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nDue to its geography, both the Hume Highway and the railway pass through Marulan.  Northbound take the services exit.  Southbound the town has its own.\n\nThe railway station sees the unbooked train services to Goulburn a few times a day. The booked services to Canberra, Melbourne and points south don't stop here.  You can put your bike on the trains, but there is limited room on some popular services.  On the weekend and some weekday services the trains are replaced by buses.  The coach drivers are usually helpful in placing the bikes on the buses if they can, but there is limited room and the service comes with the proviso that they are only carried in the available space.\n\nThe Greyhound bus to Canberra will stop on request.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe town centre can be seen on foot.  To see the surrounding area requires a motor vehicle, or push-bike with fit legs.   The train services follow the line towards Sydney and Goulburn, offering some very limited public transport opportunities.  There are no bus or taxi services.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThere is a town walk, exploring the history of the various buildings.  \n\nThere are many natural attractions of the surrounding Southern Highlands area.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" On the freeway "]},"\n\nThere are highway services directly on both sides of the freeway at Marulan.  Fuel, fast food, nothing out of the ordinary.  It is available 24-hours though, and if you are passing through early morning or late at night it is your only option.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" In town "]},"\nThe Meridian Cafe in town is nice enough, and makes a quality alternative to the freeway services for those passing through.  It isn't cheap though, with mains around $20 making it a little more than a casual quick-stop affair.  Marulan isn't any longer the preserve of the bush farmer, and the cafe is just as likely to be the Sunday morning haunt of the hobby farmer from Sydney's eastern suburbs.  The lattes are made (and priced) to match.\n\nThere is a take-away place in the general store, and you can eat across the road in the park.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["-34.715"],["150.001"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Southern_Highlands_(New_South_Wales)"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Marulan, New South Wales"]]}]
