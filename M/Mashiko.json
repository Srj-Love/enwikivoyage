Mashiko is the site of Saimyoji temple, one of the oldest temples in Tochigi prefecture, and the shrine of the Utsunomiya han, located in Kami-Obaa.  Large noborigama kilns were first founded there in 1853, by immigrant potters from the neighboring pottery community Kasama in Ibaraki prefecture.  Simple and rustic in style, the main glazes are  a clear wood ash glaze, a white rice husk ash glaze, black and kaki (persimmon), sometimes decorated with enamel red, yellow and green.   These are worlds apart from the courtly ceramics of Kyoto but yet very Japanese.   Pottery has been made since Jomon times (over 10,000 years ago) in Mashiko,  but modern Mashiko yaki dates only to 1853. The style was popularized by the potter Shoji Hamada.  He was designated as NINGEN KOKUHO (Living National Treasure) in 1955.  Because of Hamada, Mashiko yaki has been viewed as a good example of Mingei (Folkcraft) pottery.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nMashiko is a convenient day trip from Tokyo,and it is easy to get there by car, train, bus, or some combination of all three.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:MokaRail_Steam_Locomotive.jpg"],["thumb"],["Moka Railway steam locomotive"]]},"The fastest route is to take the JR Utsunomiya Line from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tokyo\/Ueno"],["Ueno"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oyama"]]},", which takes 42 min by Shinkansen or 82 min by normal train.

It's possible to rent bicycles at the train station for a cost of ¥800 per day, or ¥400 for two hours, plus ¥100 for each additional hour.\n\nMaps and English brochures are available from the tourist information office to your right as you exit the platform at Mashiko station.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" See "]},"\nThe town consists of many different pottery workshops, kilns and retail shops.
