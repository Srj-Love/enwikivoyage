The name Massachusetts comes from Algonquian Indian words that mean the great mountain, an apparent reference to the tallest of the Blue Hills, a recreation area south of the town of Milton. \n\nMassachusetts is a state of firsts - the first public school (Boston Latin School), the first public library (Boston Public Library), the first public park (Worcester), the first American university (Harvard), the first National Armory (Springfield), the first gasoline-powered automobile (Springfield), the first birth control pill (Worcester), the first public beach (Revere Beach), the first motorcycle (Springfield), the first modern fire engine (Springfield), the first liquid fuel rocket (Worcester), the birthplace of basketball (Springfield), and the birthplace of Volleyball (Holyoke). It also features the site of the Boston Massacre, the event that set off the American Revolutionary War, with the \"shot heard 'round the world\" in Concord at the Old North Bridge.\n\nMassachusetts also has its dark side, the Salem Witch Trials being one of the most significant black spots on the state's history. Though far less frequent than in the past, murders related to organized crime and rampant corruption of public officials were once a fact of life for Bostonians.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Today"]},"\n\nMassachusetts today is a blend of old and new.  In Eastern Massachusetts you can walk the 3.5 mile Freedom Trail in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boston"]]}," to see more than 20 historical sites, then hop over to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cambridge (Massachusetts)"],["Cambridge"]]}," and see some of the world's most advanced biotechnology, not to mention the legendary Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the gold standard for technical education in the United States.  The state as a whole is a blend of rural and urban, from Boston and suburbs in the East, to the gently rolling hills and lovely small villages in the Center, to the culturally, historically, and educationally rich Pioneer Valley and the rolling Berkshire Mountains in the west.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nThe easiest way to get into Eastern Massachusetts is through Logan International Airport in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boston"]]},".

Large flat sandy bogs of colorful berries are harvested in early October.\n\nInland areas offer traditional New England country cuisine, especially at rural church suppers and breakfasts. Notable dishes include spaghetti-and-meatballs, roasted chicken, baked beans, baking powder biscuits, fruit pies, and cobblers.  \n\nFar eastern and far western Massachusetts's rocky soils produce two outstanding crops: tomatoes and apples. Orchards are still mostly family-owned and many growers offer pick-your-own sales. Cider mills churn out fresh cider to sell alongside bags of apples in roadside farm stands. On a crisp fall day the stands often offer warmed fresh cider mulled with cinnamon, clove and other spices. A list is maintained ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.pickyourown.org\/massapples.htm here"]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nThe alcohol purchase age in the Commonwealth is 21. No one is permitted to serve alcohol to a person under 21 years of age. No one is allowed to possess, drink, transport or purchase alcohol if they are under 21. No open containers of alcohol are allowed in most public areas (e.g. sidewalks and parks), even for people of legal drinking age.  Massachusetts, more than any other state in the union, vigorously enforces both \"Blue Laws\" and the drinking age. Most bars, pubs, and nightclubs in Boston have a city mandated 21+ policy, which is vigorously enforced. Additionally, many establishments in Boston and Cape Cod will not serve to out of state visitors under 25. Get a ",{"type":"'''","value":["Liquor ID"]},", a state ID card available to non-residents from the Registry of Motor Vehicles if you'll be in the area for awhile, costs $25 for five years of validity.\n\nA controversial \"third party liability\" precedent has been set in Massachusetts. For example, a landlord rents an apartment to young adults who have a party and a person drinks and drives and causes an accident.  Under this \"third party liability,\" the landlord, those who hosted the party, and the one who drinks and drives can be held responsible. Rule of thumb for anyone drinking is to not drink and drive; second, if you are under 21 and want to drink in Massachusetts, you're out of luck unless you're at a private party.    \n\nTraditional New England culture back to Pilgrims and Puritans was far from abstenious.  Surprising amounts of beer, wine, hard cider and distilled spirits were consumed.  Although \"Blue Laws\" once prohibited alcohol purchases on Sundays, alcohol remains central to socializing in both urban and rural settings.\n\nMicrobreweries and brewpubs are becoming more common in urban areas and college towns.  They usually offer sandwiches and other casual fare as well as a selection of brews that can be far superior to the megabreweries'.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Driving"]}," - Massachusetts drivers have a reputation for ",{"type":"'''","value":["aggressive and careless driving"]}," including running red lights and unpredictable changes of lane or direction.  ",{"type":"'''","value":["Speeds"]}," up to 20 mph (30 kph) over posted limits are common on highways and interstates.  Pedestrians should not count on getting the right of way just because it is legally theirs.  Contrary to popular belief, Massachusetts drivers aren't all that bad.  The Commonwealth has the lowest rate of traffic fatalities in the country.  People in Massachusetts are used to tailgaters, speeders, and other sorts of aggressive drivers and aren't particularly flustered by them.  If you aren't used to this kind of driving, it's probably best to avoid it.  If you must drive, simply pay more attention to the road and you should be fine.  Drinking is a widespread social activity and ",{"type":"'''","value":["intoxicated drivers"]}," may be encountered evenings after work in working-class neighborhoods, or in college towns on Friday and Saturday evenings.\n\nWinter driving involves snow and ice, December through April.\n\nDeer are abundant and ",{"type":"'''","value":["car-deer collisions"]}," frequent, especially during fall migrations and breeding seasons which may peak on moonlit nights in November.  Collisions can occur in suburbs as well as alongside forests and fields.  These animals frequently bound high enough to crash through windshields and endanger occupants with flailing hooves.\n\nAlthough in 1846 author Thoreau had to leave Walden Pond and travel to Maine to observe ",{"type":"'''","value":["moose"]},", these larger relatives of deer are recolonizing Massachusetts as old farms revert to forest.  Moose are tall enough to topple through windshields in collisions and adults will weigh about 1\/2 ton, potentially a deadly combination for vehicle occupants.  Immediately slow down and be prepared to stop if you should see one ahead of you.  Count yourself doubly lucky to see such a large animal in a densely populated state, and to have avoided a collision.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Outdoors"]}," - Ticks can transmit ",{"type":"'''","value":["Lyme Disease"]}," unless promptly removed. After walking in woods, brush or tall grass remove clothing and look for flattened dark insects 1\/8\" to 1\/4\" diameter. If they have already attached themselves touch them with something hot to encourage them to let go. +\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Getting lost"]}," in thick woods is surprisingly easy, especially in the short days of fall and winter. In unfamiliar areas, plan your route before you set out. Carry map, compass and a whistle or some other way of making noise. Also carry extra clothing and high-calorie snacks in case you are benighted. +\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Crime"]}," - Statistically, Massachusetts is one of the least violent states.  Nevertheless there are cities with declining or vanished industries where ",{"type":"'''","value":["economic desperation"]}," makes crime a career option. Other cities have ",{"type":"'''","value":["tough neighborhoods"]},", usually with telltale signs like trash in the streets, rundown housing, graffiti and barred windows. Try to avoid walking or using public transit in these areas. Also use paid parking lots and while driving keep windows rolled up and locked. Licensed taxicabs will usually be a safe way of getting around these areas.  Tough neighborhoods have disproportionate numbers of people with ",{"type":"'''","value":["bad attitudes"]},".  Try not to \"cross\" them.  ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bicycle theft"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["car break-ins"]}," are the most common types of crime.  Avoid leaving electronics or other valuables visible in your car.  In cities, having a strong bike lock (U-locks are best) is highly recommended as bike thieves do carry bolt cutters.  Leaving your bike parked in a high-visibility area (especially if there are few other tempting bikes around at the time) significantly increases the risk of theft compared to finding indoor parking.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Respect "]},"\n\nMassachusetts, home of Northampton, Provincetown, and the first US state to legalize same-sex marriage, is arguably the most accepting state in all of the USA. Gay villages exist in abundance in Boston, and in smaller cities such as Springfield.\n\nMassachusetts has a sports rivalry with New York, notably between the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees (baseball), but also in American football (between the New England Patriots and New York Jets, and, to a lesser extent, the New York Giants). The Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers (basketball) also have a fierce rivalry, although there are fewer visible LA fans due to distance. Finally, the Boston Bruins and Montreal Canadiens (hockey) have been rivals for a long time. While wearing merchandise of rival teams will generally only elicit mild comments or playful joking throughout New England, it can sometimes lead to harassment or confrontation, particularly before, during, or after important sports games. This is especially true of Yankees gear. It should also be noted that wearing rivals merchandise in bars or other more casual settings may result in poor service, or harassment from other tables. Many people from outside the US wear Yankees caps or t-shirts after visiting New York, unaware of the connotations in Boston\/Massachusetts, and can find themselves getting yelled at for no apparent reason.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Rhode Island"]]}]}," - The capital city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Providence"]]}," is a short journey to the south of Masschusetts."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Connecticut"]]}]}," - Massachusetts' southern neighbor is home Hartford and the southern half of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Knowledge Corridor"]]},", Mystic Seaport, the restaurant and nightlife scene in downtown ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Haven"]]},", the Maritime Aquarium, and two major Native American casinos.
