The optimal is to take the Via Blanca highway but not up to Matanzas City. Instead take a small road to the right about 5 km after the bridge over the Bacunayagua River and descend till the Yumurí Valley.\n\nBird watching: The Yumurí Valley offers some good areas for bird watching, with best population density by the trees next to the heights that border the Valley.\n\nFluvial Tours: Although not located by the city center, the River Canímar, the most copious of all 4 rivers that opens at the Matanzas Bay, is located at a few kilometers away from the city. It is a navigable river for smaller draught boats. Navigation begins by the bridge that crosses the Canímar River, by the road that links Matanzas and Varadero, towards rustic restaurant by the river and covers some 13 km. During this trajectory, views are quite beautiful with its best sites being those by the road that communicates Matanzas and Varadero where the river meanders can be observed. At the end of the course there is a line of Real Palm trees leading to the restaurant. In this site besides having lunch, you can take horseback tours. The fluvial trips can be taken in boat either ways or half the trip by bus and return by navigating the river.\n\nBoats are roofless so it is recommended to take a raincoat and umbrella to protect you from the sun or casual rain.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Hotel Playa Girón"]},"\nThe Playa Giron Diving Center offers  services from the shore but does not provide boat transportation since the diving sites are less than 80 meters from the shore.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["23.051111"],["-81.575278"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Matanzas_(province)"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Matanzas"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Matanzas City"]]}]
