Since 1907, a narrow gauge railway line connects Matheran to Neral in the plains. Motor vehicles are completely banned in Matheran, making it quite peaceful despite the thousands of visitors that come here, mostly from Mumbai. There are a number of lookout points that provide spectacular views of the surrounding hills and valley.\n\nMatheran is a plateau with a reasonably dense forest cover. Being a hill station it is pleasant almost throughout the year. In winter, the nights can get a bit chilly though. The best time to go to Matheran is post-monsoon. It is truly spectacular at this time of the year with lush greenery, waterfalls and the lake full with water.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nThere is a entry fee (of Rs. 40  for adult visitors and Rs. 20 for children from May 1, 2012) to Matheran.

This toy train is not operational when railway route is under maintenance or when there is a perceived hazard e.g. the monsoons. Unfortunately, the only way to find this out is at the Neral Station.  \n\nNeral to Matheran tickets as of Novermber 2009 costs are 1st Class 210Rs, 2nd Class Reserved 35Rs, 2nd class unreserved 20Rs.  Tickets can be booked from 3 to 1 day in advance, and then on the day of travel from 45 minutes before the train.\n\nThe train is often full, so turn up in good time to ensure you get a ticket. You can also book the ticket online through IRCTC",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/irctc.co.in"]},". If there's a queue of unmoving people at the ticket window with a salesman who is reading the paper, then all the 2nd class tickets are sold out. Jump the queue to the window and ask for 1st class as the're usually still available.\n\nThe toy train times (as of Nov. 2009) are:\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Matheran Toy train.jpg"],["200px"],["thumb"],["right"],["Matheran Toy train"]]},"\n\n\nNeral -> Matheran:\n",{"type":"*","value":["depart 0730, arrive 0930"]},{"type":"*","value":["depart 0850, arrive 1110"]},{"type":"*","value":["depart 1015, arrive 1210"]},{"type":"*","value":["depart 1215, arrive 1405"]},{"type":"*","value":["depart 1705, arrive 1900"]},"\nMatheran -> Neral:\n",{"type":"*","value":["depart 0700, arrive 0840"]},{"type":"*","value":["depart 0945, arrive 1125"]},{"type":"*","value":["depart 1340, arrive 1520"]},{"type":"*","value":["depart 1445, arrive 1625 "]},{"type":"*","value":["depart 1625, arrive 1810"]},"\nHere is a list of local train timings from Neral back to CST:\n0246,0356,0425,0517,0532,0607,0654,0716,0734,0808,0837,0718,0954,1109,1232,1331,1416,1440,1553,1631,1705,1729,1837,1854,1954,2056,2141,2223,2256,0222.\n\n\nAlternately, there are many share-a-cabs which take you to Matheran from Neral. The distance from Neral to Dasturi Point (last point to which vehicles are allowed in Matheran) is 11 km.  The drivers that ply through the roads have immaculate driving skills, so a real advice here is not to keep eyeing the blind turns and foot-to-brake co-ordination, but to just enjoy the breath-taking views as you climb up towards the Dasturi point.  (Charges are INR 60.00 per person ($1.2) as of Oct. 2010.  Also make sure you take the rearmost seats as it will provide a relatively more comfortable travel. Once you have left the taxi, you can take a horse ride or get the help of porters to carry luggage up to the town.\n\nThere is sadly no convenient express train to get back to CST in the evening.  You can get a local train from Neral to Karjat (away from Mumbai), and then an express train back from Karjat into Mumbai.  But this will take longer than just getting a local train from Neral back into town.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Cars are not allowed within Matheran"]},". However you can drive up and park your car at Dasturi car point, or take the newly introduced mini bus shuttle from Karjat or Neral railway stations upto Dasturi.  From Dasturi you must take a 40 minute horseback or man-pulled rickshaw ride to Matheran along a mud track.  \n\nAlternately you can walk from Dasturi along the rail line and make your way up to Matheran - 20 minutes to half an hour. The rail track route is slightly shorter, more scenic and very much more comfortable than the rubbly, dusty main road route.  Coolies or porters are available at Dasturi to carry your luggage.  Remember to negotiate rates in advance. You can also go with group booking or alone.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["On foot"]},"\nThere are several walking trails which ascend the Matheran Plateau. These are used by local people commuting to the hill station as well as the occasional intrepid holiday-maker. \n\nFrom the Eastern side, trekkers start at Neral (see above). \n\nYou can also approach from the Western side, which has the distinct advantage that you can be in the shade for most of the ascent if you start early in the morning.  One route recommended during monsoon starts from the village of Dudhoni and brings you to Sunset Point in Matheran.  It is suitable for beginners, and the ascent only takes 2 hours or so. There is apparently a side trip to a waterfall, but I have not done this. Dudhoni can be reached by autorickshaw from Panvel (accessible by bus or central line train).

Apart from the ubiquitous bonnet macaque or aggressive Matheran monkeys !\n\nThere are numerous points all over Matheran, many of which provide some fantastic views of the valley below. While the central area and marked vistas are crowded, it is quite easy to find yourself all alone if you step off the beaten track.  There are numerous forested trails leading to most of the points.  Wear thick-soled footwear and carry a walking stick for greater comfort as some of the trails are very rubbly, nothing more than dry river beds.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Horse riding"]}," is also quite popular way of getting around in Matheran.

It is a great way to travel for people who prefer not to walk, but rates must be negotiated in advance.\n\nOne must do adventure in Matheran is ",{"type":"'''''","value":["VALLEY CROSSING"]},". It is from Honeymoon point to near Louisa Point. Its basically a U-shaped mountain and you have to go from one side to other side (approx. 900 feet) hanging on rope with 1000 feet valley below(!). It works thanks to 3 ropes, pulleys and gravity. It is a one-way lane, ao coming back is by walking or you can ask your Horse-Man to come to that point to pick you up.

While there are many hotels in the centre of town, there are more secluded hotels down the paths away from the central buildings. Its always better to stay in hotels in the market as you can roam around there once it gets dark. In far off hotels you would get locked up in the room as it won't be advisable to venture out in the dark in forest. Better do not book any rooms from the agents who would surround you at Nerel Station. There are many rooms (Hotels, Cottages, Resorts) up at the Matheran Market and it is better to actually check the rooms and then deal directly with the owners as this can save money as well as the disappointed of being dubbed into a poorly maintained and sub-standard room!
