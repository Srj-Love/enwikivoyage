Services linking the smaller villages away from the main A6 trunk road may be restricted to certain hours of the day (e.g. school runs) or even certain days of the week.\n\nThere are two bus stations in Matlock, one is next to the railway station on Derwent Way, and the other is situated on Bakewell Road in the town centre.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThere are pleasant river views from Hall Leys Park in the town centre. A riverside walk starts in the park and proceeds into the Derwent gorge towards Matlock Bath; this also gives access to a footpath up the East side of the gorge and along the cliff tops above High Tor, the spectacular sheer limestone crag between Matlock and Matlock Bath.\nMatlock Bath merits a visit for its natural setting and Victorian charm. The riverside is developed on one side only - the West bank - with woods and crags on the opposite bank, through which wind the Lovers' Walks. Although about as far as one can get from the sea in England, it has an almost seaside feel and none of the elegance of spa towns such as Cheltenham, Leamington or Bath. \n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Peak Rail"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.peakrail.co.uk"],["email=peakrail@peakrail.co.uk"],["address=Matlock, DE4 3NA"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+44 1629 580381"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The Boxing Day Raft Race is good."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The town comes alive at weekends in summertime, particularly on Sundays when large numbers of motorcyclists converge on the promenade to meet up and show off their machines.
