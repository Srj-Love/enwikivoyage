However, the city's star attraction — ",{"type":"'''","value":["Dōgo Onsen"]}," (道後温泉) — is a good time in any season, drawing serious hot spring enthusiasts and newcomers alike to its steamy waters.

His literary career began when he started criticizing the Edo period's iconic haiku artist Matsuo Bashō and praising ",{"type":"'''","value":["Yosa Buson"]},", whose work he felt was brief yet refined. Shiki is credited with revitalizing Japanese poetry and modernizing its themes, thus making the short verse once again relevant to modern Japanese culture.\n\nMatsuyama's bastions of literary pride span centuries, and many of the city's attractions celebrate that heritage with unabashed cheer.
