At Nata, take the A3.  (It is well-signposted.)\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nThere are daily buses from the bus rank in Gaborone to Maun at 5:30AM, 7AM, and 11:30AM (recommend catching the 5:30AM one, if you wish to get to Maun before dark).  However, it’s a good idea to double check with the locals if the departure times have changed. As of June 2011 the bus fare was P 150.00 pula per person (about $23 USD). There are no ticket counters at the bus rank, so the tickets cannot be purchased ahead of time. The ticket payment is collected right on the bus.  The bus ride takes about 9 to 10 hrs.  Buses to\/from Francistown cost about 90 pula and take about 5 to 6 hours, departing Francistown about once an hour from 07:30 to around 15:30.\n\nIf you're traveling to\/from Namibia, smaller buses between Maun and Ghanzi cost about 50 pula and take about 4 hours; in Ghanzi you can connect with another bus to\/from the Namibian border at Charles Hill\/Mamuno (P40, 3.5 hours), but there is no organised transport from there towards Windhoek so you will have to resort to (probably paid) hitchhiking.  If you get the first (8:30AM) bus out of Maun you will probably make it through to Windhoek in one day.  There are also buses from Maun towards Shakawe and the Caprivi Strip.\n\nIf you want to travel from Maun to Kasane, it's best to get a Francistown\/Gaborone bus and get off at Nata, where you can catch a northbound bus towards Kasane.  The same thing works in the opposite direction; either way you'll need to start out as early as possible to be assured of making the connection.\n\nThe buses on major routes are pretty nice compared to many other African countries, but still not exactly luxurious: 5 non-reclining seats in a row, little leg-room and no bathrooms (however, they generally make frequent stops that are long enough to use a bathroom at the bus station).  Smaller buses are even less comfortable and more likely to fill up completely.  If travelling during the winter (Jun, Jul, and Aug) make sure to dress in layers, since it is freezing cold in the morning and toasty hot in the afternoon.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe core of Maun, say from Riley's Hotel to the airport, is walkable, but usually hot.

To show that you want a taxi, stick your arm out parallel to the ground, perpendicular (and towards) the road, palm-down, and flap your fingers.  (Raising your hand will probably also work, but the finger-flapping is the way the locals do it.)\n\nNote that taxis do not have a central dispatch system.  Thus, if you want to call a taxi to fetch you from somewhere a bit remote, you need to have the mobile number of a taxi driver.  Also note that driving after dark is dangerous (due to animals on the road), so there will be fewer taxis running after dark.\n\nCombis (vans) run from the bus station along ten specified routes. \n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Route 1"]}," north to the airport, and the camps north of town"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Route 7"]}," southeast to Maun Educational Park"]},"\nThe following companies offer cars for hire.
