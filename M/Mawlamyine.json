However, due its shape and balance (3 stones on top of each other) this golden rock looks more impressive. To go there you can get pick-ups from the roundabout in front of the bridge (the location in Lonely Planet is wrong, the buses start about 500 m further west). They charge you 1,000 kyat, maybe cheaper if you haggle. Trishaw-taxis offer you the same trip for 8,000 kyat return, but you can get them down to 5,000 kyat (which is worth it as return pick-ups are rare). From the base of the mountain you can either hike up (at least 2 hr each way. Bring enough water and good shoes as the heat and humidity are killers) or you can try to get a work truck (2,000 kyat per person return). If you go in low season and on a work day, there is a fair chance that you will be the only person there. Thus, the work truck can be more expensive, if they even run! Going back, you can wait for a passing pick-up or trishaw. Organised shared pick-ups are rare, especially in the late afternoon.
