The reason for its large growth was the large amount of timber in the area, seen by developers as a potential for making charcoal, and several kilns. After that development, immigrants from the Palatinate states of Germany settled there to till the land for better drainage. One can see many of the immigrants' sturdy brick homes, built between 1870 and 1900, along Maybee's farm roads. The Canadian Southern Railroad came through Maybee to build a station, stabilizing the surrounding economy. It was eventually incorporated in 1899.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Maybee Village Hall"],["url="],["email="],["address=9059 Raisin Street"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=This historic building was built\/founded on 1912."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\nArea code: 734\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["42.00389"],["-83.51556"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Monroe_County_(Michigan)"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Maybee, Michigan"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North_America\/United_States\/Michigan\/Localities\/M\/Maybee\/"]]}]
