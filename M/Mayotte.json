In March 2009, the islands voted overwhelmingly (95.2%) to become France's 101st 'departement' effective in 2011. The island is 95% Muslim and many Muslim customs such as polygamy, Islamic-inspired law, and male dominance are commonplace, although all will be reversed in accordance with French law by 2011. A large amount of the island's population is composed of illegal aliens from neighboring Comoros. Despite the island's French ownership, less than half of the population understands French and very few speak French fluently.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nTropical; marine; hot, humid, rainy season during northeastern monsoon (November to May); dry season is cooler (May to November).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\nGenerally undulating, with deep ravines and ancient volcanic peaks.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Mayotte map.png"],["right"],["thumb"],["350px"],["Map of Mayotte"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Mamoudzou"]]}," — capital of the island"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Bandele"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Dzaoudzi"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Sada"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nPlanes fly daily between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Réunion"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dzaoudzi"]]},", the airport\/military base in Mayotte.
