One of them was Konrad I of Masovia, who was the ruler who summoned the Teutonic Order to fight against the savage Old Prussians tribes in 1226. When the Polish kingdom was restored in 1295, the Duchy of Masovia remained first independent, but in 1351 the dukes of Masovia became vassals of the Kingdom of Poland, and after the death of the last Masovian ruler, Janusz III of Masovia, in 1526, Masovia became a voivodeship of the Poland. In the 16th century the region of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Warmińsko-Mazurskie"]]}," was largely populated by colonists from Masovia. Masovia was annexed by Prussia in the 1795 during the third partition of Poland. In 1807 it became part of the Duchy of Warsaw during the Napoleonic Wars and later part of the Congress Poland after the Congress of Vienna. In 1918 Masovia was included within the newly formed  the Second Polish Republic. During World War II Nazi Germany occupied Poland and Masovia was divided between the General Government and the Province of East Prussia.
