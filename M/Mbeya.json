The well established scam artists attempt to sell tickets into various cities in Malawi. They have various price sheets and other documentation. They will even make phone calls to verify there is availability on the bus. One group even has an office in the Malawi transportation\/bus center. They will get the passengers on a dalla-dallas that will just let them off at the border where there is supposed another bus that is waiting. Of course, there isn't.   Please note that as of April 2010 there are NO buses that go directly from Mbeya to Malawi. The buses only go to the border town of Kyela.   \n\nThere is frequent local transport, both 30-seat \"coaster\" buses and dalla-dallas to Kyela. Double check that the driver can drop you off at the border (\"boda-boda\"). The border stop is only a 5-10 minute walk from the Songwe River bridge crossing into Malawi. Note that there are no services on the Malawi side of the border; have a few hundred kwacha on hand to secure transportation at least as far as Karonga. For Itungi and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lake Nyasa"]]}," (Lake Malawi), you will need to ride all the way to Kyela and secure additional transport from there.\n\nLocal transport also runs to Tunduma on the Zambian border; onward transportation can be arranged on the Zambian side.\n\nIf Mbeya is your stop off on entering Tanzania on the way to Dar es Salaam, try to head for Iringa next, an easy 4-5 hour bus ride. The district capital, Iringa is a good base for exploring the highlands along the Tanzam road.
