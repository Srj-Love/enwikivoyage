Men farm the gardens, but women control the sale at all levels, except the export.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThough discovered by the then colonial Governor of Senegal, Pinet Laprade, in 1862, the community of Mboro was not formalized until 1936 when travelers, carrying goods from the then capital of St. Louis to the port in Dakar, found need for a stopping point long the coast. After land surveys were conducted by the French, a base for fruit and vegetable production was instituted in Mboro and many Senegalese were enticed to move to the coast from Mékhé, Tivaouane, and other surrounding towns. Anyone who made the move received a trunk, a mosquito net, a piece of land, and tools to plant seeds and begin their new lives. Since then, Mboro has been regarded as the premiere source of fruits and vegetables, among cities along the northern coast.\n\nIn the 1950s, a new dynamic was added to the economy with the extraction and sale of minerals found in the rich soils. The first neighborhoods were formed by 1954, including the very unique neighborhood of Mbaye Mbaye; which today stands as a tribute to Western culture and the first factory managers that built it. The government formally organized the mining industry nation-wide in 1985, with the creation of Idustries Chimiques du Sénégal (ICS), including the factories of Mboro\/ Darou Khoudass.\n\nToday a unique blend of Wolof, Pulaar and Sereer ethnicities call this oasis home. Revered for being flush with sea breezes and produce, Mboro is anything but your ordinary tourist destination. Tucked quietly by the coast, and a 30 minute ride from the national route, this is a must see sight for those in seek of a truly African experience.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Respect"]},"\nThe Senegalese are a very friendly and hospitable group of people.
