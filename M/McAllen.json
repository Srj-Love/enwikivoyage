It is the unofficial capital of the southernmost region of Texas, commonly referred to as the Rio Grande Valley, and acts as the social, financial, entertainment and shopping hub for the region which boasts 1.3 million residents. McAllen's vitality drives the city's tourism, business, education, shopping, and health advances, often placing it ahead of Texas and the nation.  McAllen is one of the fastest growing cities in the United States, and is rated as one of the best U.S. places to do business and one of the top 8 safest U.S. cities.  \n\nThe city has grown rapidly over the past century.  In 1910 the population was about 150.  The city now has a population exceeding 130,000, but serves the 4 million people within a 60-mile radius.",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.mcallen.net\/info\/default.aspx"]}," Over 85% of the city's population is Hispanic or Latino; almost everyone in bilingual to some degree.  \n\nMcAllen is the most popular U.S. shopping destination for Mexican residents. The city hosts millions of Mexican shoppers per year, and therefore accommodates a much larger number of retail stores and restaurants than other cities of its size.  Many of the Mexican tourists and shoppers in the area come from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mexico"],["Monterrey"]]},", a highly technologically advanced city and the third most populous in Mexico, with a population of about 4 million. A brief glance at a mall parking lot, however, will reveal shoppers from almost all 32 states of Mexico. \n\nMcAllen is renowned for its warm winter weather and low cost of living.  In the winter months, large numbers of retirees live in the McAllen area. Affectionately called Winter Texans, they come predominantly from the midwestern United States and Canada and stay in RV parks, apartments, second homes and extended-stay hotels. Winter is \"season\" for McAllern, and the time with most of the social activities, many planned especially for Winter Texans.\n\nMcAllen is also the hub of the Rio Grande Valley for birding. 2.3 million birders visit the McAllen region every year. There are literally dozens of birding spots in the McAllen area, including the World Birding Centers, a complex of 9 sites dedicated to wildlife watching. 528 bird species and over 300 butterfly species have been recorded in the area, making it the most productive birding location in North America. Go to www.visitmcallen.com and www.southtexasnature.com for more information.\n\nThe first real development in the area that would later become McAllen occurred in the 1850's.  That development was led by John McAllen.  In 1904, he established a town site then known as West McAllen.  In 1907, a separate group of developers established a town known as East McAllen.  Eventually, the two towns merged and the City of McAllen was incorporated in 1911.",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.mcallen.net\/info\/history.aspx"]},"\n\nMcAllen is surrounded by several medium size towns and cities.  These cities are so interconnected that they sometimes appear to be one larger city.
