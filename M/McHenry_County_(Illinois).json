With the expansion of I-90 and daily commuter service to Chicago, many parts of the county (specifically the southeastern and southern portions) became increasingly developed and are now considered suburbs of Chicago.  However, many portions of the county (particularly the western and northern regions) are still largely rural.  The modern day county is a mixture of old and new but remains largely politically conservative.  It continues to be one of the fastest growing areas of the region.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nMcHenry County is most accessible using I-90 from either Chicago or Rockford.  However, many other arterial routes cross the area including US 14 (passes through most major communities in the County), US 12 (passes immediately to the east of the County and then through Richmond) and US 20 (passes to the south and then through Marengo).  A number of State routes also crisscross the County.\n\nMetra, the greater Chicagoland passenger rail system, offers daily service to and from Chicago's Ogilvie Station on the Union Pacific Northwest Line via a number of communities in the County including Harvard, Woodstock, McHenry, Crystal Lake, Pingree Road (second Crystal Lake stop) and Cary.  Service may terminate in Crystal Lake, McHenry or Harvard depending on the train.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Itineraries"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nBy and large, McHenry County is safe.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["42.305"],["-88.401"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Northern Illinois"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:McHenry County, Illinois"]]}]
