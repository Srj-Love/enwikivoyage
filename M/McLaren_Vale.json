Car hires are available in Adelaide for all budgets ranging from the world wide brands, down to rent-a wreck cheapies. Renting and returning a hire car is a no-brainer. \n\nA far more scenic route, avoiding miles of car yards, traffic lights and suburban build up is to take the Mt Barker Highway (the main road out of Adelaide to Melbourne) and leave the highway to enter Hahndorf. From there drive to Meadows and then follow the sign posts to McLaren Vale. On arriving in McLaren Vale, initially turn right, back toward Adelaide, and drive about 300 metres down the main street to the outskirts of the town as the tourist centre with winery location maps is on the Adelaide side of the town.\n\nThere are various tour companies in Adelaide which will offer bus tours of McLaren Vale.
