[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Mechanicsburg"]}," is a borough in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cumberland County (Pennsylvania)"],["Cumberland County"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pennsylvania"]]},", USA. Mechanicsburg is eight miles west of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Harrisburg"]]}," and the town itself has a total area of 2.6 square miles of land.  On April 12, 1828 the borough was given the name Mechanicsburg after the increased settlement of Conestago Wagon mechanics to the area.  Designated as a water station for the restocking of locomotives in the 1800s, railroads played a vital role in Mechanicsburg's development linking the town to the business and industry world. Grain and feed companies, lumber yards, and numerous factories were intentionally placed along these tracks to attract more business. During the 19th century an average of 25 trains chugged through the town daily carrying travelers, mail, newspapers, coal, and food. However, today only six trains travel through each day. This number did not used to be this high until Norfolk Southern gained more work on the local sub-line running through Mechanicsburg. Today Mechanicsburg is most well known for being the hometown of Shawn Abner, Del Beshore, Brett Michaels, Ricky Rockett, Karen Bill and home to Jubilee Day, the largest and longest-running-one-day street fair on the east coast. Mechanicsburg has had many nicknames throughout the years. It was first known to be called Drytown because of the intense droughts in the winters and summers, Pinchgut, which is a German term meaning a small town with very little people, and Staufferstown after Henry Stauffer who owned much of the land in the colonial time. The last nickname was Creekville because of the many creeks and small bodies of water located in Mechanicsburg.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nHarrisburg International Airport is located approximately sixteen miles from the center of Mechanicsburg.
