From 1506 to 1530 it was the capital of the Netherlands under Margaret of Austria.  In 1559 it became an archbishopric, a sign of great importance.  It was famous for its wood carvings, some of which can still be seen in the churches of the city, and for lace and tapestry manufacture.  \n\nToday it is a vibrant town, mixing trendy and traditional.  Its carillon school is world-renowned, training students from all over the world in the art of playing carillons, sets of 24 or more bells hung in church towers.  Shops downtown are often housed in buildings with the old-style Flemish architecture, but offer edgy fashions sure to appeal to the younger generation.  \n\nMechelen is developing into the center of non-profit or non-governmental organizations for Flanders. Some famous examples are Natuurpunt, AFS, and the Red Cross.  This is mainly because it's very easily reachable (by train or by highway) but not as expensive as Brussels.\n\nInhabitants are called \"Maneblussers\" (",{"type":"''","value":["moon-extinghuisers"]},"). The story goes that one day long time ago the moonlight was shining on the unfinished St.-Romboutstoren and that some people thought it was burning. The whole city was mobilized to extinguish the fire but there was no fire to extinguish.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nMechelen is easily reached by train.
