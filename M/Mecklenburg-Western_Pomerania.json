Low German is a language spoken in northern Germany and the Netherlands, (where it goes by a different name).

Take some time though - a 50km ride can take an hour or more, which is considerably longer than elsewhere in Germany. Bus connections are usually only available when no concurring train service is present and many lines are infrequent. In rural areas, traveling by car is the most comfortable way to get around. The quality of the roads is generally very good. Locals often drive aggressively, disrespecting speed limits and passing recklessly.\n\nA very interesting way to get around is by bicycle. There are special touristic bikeways along the Baltic coast and from Berlin to Rostock. Most regular roads also make attractive bike routes. Main roads often have separate bicycle lanes beside them. If they don't, keep off - riding there is both dangerous and unpleasant!\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]}," \n",{"type":"*","value":[" the hanseatic cities on the Baltic coast, namely Wismar, Stralsund, Rostock and Greifswald are well worth a visit."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jasmund National Park"]]}," with the 118 m chalk cliff \"Königstuhl\" (\"Kings chair\") on the island Rügen"]},{"type":"*","value":[" the 5 km long KdF-building complex and ruins in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Prora"]]}," on the east coast of Rügen (KdF = \"Kraft durch Freude\" => \"Strength By Joy\"): Not pretty, but impressive"]},{"type":"*","value":[" the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kap Arkona"]]}," (Cape Arkona) on the north coast of Rügen"]},{"type":"*","value":[" the beautiful sea bridges (seebrücke - or \"piers\" in UK English) of some coastal towns (e.g. Sellin \/ Rügen Island and Ahlbeck \/ Usedom Island)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Dobbertin Abbey"],["url=http:\/\/www.kloster-dobbertin.de\/English\/englisch_uebersicht.htm"],["email=foerderverein@kloster-dobbertin.de"],["address=Am Kloster, Dobbertin, Landstrasse Nr. 192"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=In Ludwigslust-Parchim Between Sternberg and Goldberg"],["phone=+49 38736 86121"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Guided tours at 15:00 We,Su May-Sep, except for the Brauhaus most of the abbey is only open in the summer"],["price=€3 for the tours"],["content=The Abbey was founded in 1220.
