Charlotte is very much a Carolina city, despite its outside influence, so try the barbeque.  The specific kinds of restaurants you encounter will depend on what part of the county you're in. Central Charlotte is full of upscale bistros and pubs, whereas the areas around the interstates are full of fast-food and chain restaurants. If you're near a large body of water (Lake Norman or the Catawba River), expect to see more seafood restaurants.  Also, older parts of the city (especially the historic inner suburbs) are full of \"local flavor\" restaurants which usually feature plenty of fried foods.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Riverview Inn"]},", 10012 Moore's Chapel Loop, ",{"type":"''","value":["+1"]}," 704-399-3385.

An extremely common complaint is that outsiders tend to compare the area unfavorably to other towns, which may unintentionally come across as condescending or rude.
