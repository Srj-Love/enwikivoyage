Summers are warm with a median temperature of 94 degrees and an average of 15 days over 100 degrees. Humidity is low. Because of the layout of surrounding mountains, Medford's climate is more similar to that of nearby northern California than the rest of Oregon: relatively dry, with warmer summers and more mild winters.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Forecast"],["Medford"],["42.28"],["-122.89"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Imperial"],["janhigh =   47"],["febhigh =   53"],["marhigh =   58"],["aprhigh =   64"],["mayhigh =   72"],["junhigh =   81"],["julhigh =   90"],["aughigh =   90"],["sephigh =   83"],["octhigh =   70"],["novhigh =   52"],["dechigh =   45"],["janlow =    30"],["feblow =    33"],["marlow =    35"],["aprlow =    39"],["maylow =    44"],["junlow =    50"],["jullow =    55"],["auglow =    54"],["seplow =    48"],["octlow =    40"],["novlow =    35"],["declow =    31"],["janprecip =  5.67"],["febprecip =  3.3"],["marprecip =  2.55"],["aprprecip =  1.51"],["mayprecip =  1.21"],["junprecip =  0.68"],["julprecip =  0.31"],["augprecip =  0.52"],["sepprecip =  0.78"],["octprecip =  1.31"],["novprecip =  3.43"],["decprecip =  4.4"],["description ="]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nThe Rogue Valley International-Medford Airport, located in Medford, is the area's regional airport serving Jackson County, the entire Rogue Valley, and seven addition counties.
