[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["TT Banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Medical Tourism"]}," is a growing concept worldwide where people travel to another country for medical treatment at lower cost or to enjoy a vacation along with their treatment.\n\nTypically, medical tourism involves residents of high-income countries seeking medical treatment in low-income countries; often the costs are much lower.  Residents of countries with national health care schemes - such as Canada and Great Britain - sometimes travel overseas to avoid the long waiting times such schemes bring. Others may travel for cosmetic surgery not covered by insurance.  However couples are increasingly seeking fertility treatments abroad.  Others have sought more sophisticated surgery - such as cardiology treatments - overseas.\n\nAvailability of good low-cost medical services can also be a major factor in selecting a destination for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["retiring abroad"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Possible benefits of medical tourism"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Most obvious benefit is lower cost of treatment."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Most travelers incorporate a short holiday along with the treatment as these also tend to be cheaper than vacations in their home country."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Medical tourists sometimes can avail themselves of the best doctors and hospitals of a foreign country.

In private sector the Metropolitan Hospital in Athens is regarded as being the best in Greece, and the plastic surgeons associated with that hospital are among the best.  Greece is also traditionally regarded as a popular tourist destination and therefore its tourism and service sectors are well developed.

You may need to stay days or weeks beyond the date of the medical procedure itself.  Be realistic about the finances of medical tourism.  Sure the medical treatment itself may be cheap.  But when you add on airfare, hotels, taxis, restaurants -- all in an unfamiliar city -- the actual cost may be close to what you would pay at home. \n\nNext, involve your home doctor in your plans!  Having major surgery in a faraway country is not a decision you should take lightly.  Research - what sort of questions should you ask your doctor about this procedure?  How is the procedure typically performed, and will it be done this way where you travel?  Who credentials doctors and hospitals in your destination country, and what credentials do your intended providers have?  You should also determine what level of follow up care your procedure may require - in the days, weeks, and even years after the procedure.  Who will provide this follow up care?\n\nNot all medical tourism is enjoyed by patients travelling away from their home country, or traveling to a third world region. For instance, migraine surgery is performed only in the US, and attracts patients from the Middle East and Africa, since their surgeons aren't able to perform this. If you are considering traveling from within your country or outside of it, be sure to explore all of your options. Seek assistance from many sources in locating the right doctor and the right country.\n\nConsider the languages you speak and what is spoken in your country.  In some countries, such as Singapore, India, the Philippines and South Africa, most educated people speak English.  This can be an important consideration.  \n\nLastly confirm, and double check, your plans.  How can you contact family members while abroad?  Do you need a special visa or proof of ability to afford treatment in order to enter your destination country?\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nIn the past, some discredited or bogus doctors set up shop outside US borders to promote dubious or dangerous treatments or outright scams (alleged cures for cancer, lengthening body parts, etc.)  Medical tourism today is far removed from these scammers but one must still be vigilant.  At the very least, see a trusted doctor in your home country and discuss your plans for overseas treatment.\n\nReputation counts in medical treatment overseas.  Look for top quality hospitals and clinics with well known doctors.\n\nRealize that, should a worst-case scenario occur, your legal avenues for making a malpractice claim or filing a lawsuit will be greatly reduced and often nonexistent.  Freedom from frivolous lawsuits and huge insurance premiums are one reason why some doctors choose to practice overseas and can offer low cost treatments.  On the other hand, this type of legal environment makes seeking doctors of good reputation all the more important. \n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["PartOfTopic"],["Stay healthy"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usabletopic"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Medical tourism"]]}]
