The Heian period saw the arrival of Tendai (天台)  and  the esoteric school of Shingon (眞言), while the latter wave brought the more faith based schools of  Jodo Shu (Pure Land School; 浄土宗) and Jodo Shinshu (浄土真; True Pure Land School) and the various Zen Schools (禅宗).   \n\nAmong the various schools of Buddhism that took root in Japan, perhaps Zen is the most well known overseas, and in many ways Zen and Japanese culture are synonymous. Japanese gardens, tea ceremony and martial arts were all either direct expressions of the Zen spirit or were greatly influenced by it. Perhaps as a result of its overseas fame,  the majority of overseas visitors who come to Japan to study meditation will do so at a Zen monastery. The other school that has attracted some overseas interest is Shingon, though not to the same extent as Zen.\n\nMany monasteries offer multi-day meditation courses for the lay community, though only a few cater to non-Japanese speakers. Below is a list of those that have provision for overseas visitors. NB: This list serves only as a 'pointer.' More detailed information is available on the city or prefecture article where the temple is located. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Prepare"]},"\nFew monasteries entertain trainees who arrive without prior notice, so  it is important to first contact the monastery to discuss your plans. This can be done by written correspondence or phone. Some monasteries do not charge guests, though many do. Check the nightly rate before making long term plans. \n\nAs a resident you are required to participate in the schedule 100% fully, and this can be quite rigorous. In addition to long periods of meditation, there  are many hours devoted to physical labor. Visitors should be aware of the schedule before arriving.  \n\nPrepare loose clothing suitable for sitting in lotus posture, such as full-length skirts or loose-fitting trousers, and durable clothing for working outdoors. Shorts or clothing that is tight or low cut should be avoided. In addition, as many monasteries are in the  mountains, ensure to bring warm clothing, even in the summer.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Temples that offer multi-day meditation courses"]},"\nCategorized according to tradition.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Rinzai Zen"]},"\nPredominant in the Kyoto region.
