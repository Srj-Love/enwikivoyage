Under the management of Rani Resorts, there are a dozen or so bungalows that face the water and lagoon. These are  all individual with a deck, a mini plunge pool and outdoor shower. The decoration is a glorious version of beach house shabby-chic with hints of the orient through ornaments and decoration. It is an amazing place for honeymooners, couples and those who want to be lazy most of the time.\n\nHowever, the island also attracts a substantial number of nature lovers for two reasons - the birds that come to the island and the marine life in the surrounding waters. Scuba diving is subject to tidal changes but there are some impressive wall dives within a short boat ride and the hard coral reefs are close to pristine. On land, there are visiting terns, herons and egrets as well as many other small birds.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Northern Mozambique"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Medjumbe Island"]]}]
