Most of the rooms are furnished in period style. A newer section was the living (and death) quarters of one of Germany's best known poets, Annette von Droste-Hülshoff. This castle is probably the single best reason to visit Meersburg. It also has a small cafe with outdoor seating with lake view. If you only want to visit the cafe, you can see the first few rooms of the castle for free on your way to it. (To do this, you have to buy a cafe coupon for a couple of euros which is then used to purchase items at the cafe.) Absolutely recommended if you happen to be there on a day when there's a clear view of the alps across the lake."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=New Castle"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=Adults €4, children €1"],["content=This baroque castle was built between 1712 and 1760.
