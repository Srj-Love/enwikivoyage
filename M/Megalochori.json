The roads narrow frighteningly for a nervous passenger as you get closer to the village. There is a central square with a couple of tavernas. There are numerous wine tasting places here and indeed this village is at the heart of the island's wine industry. The vineyards are located all round the village, the vines coiled in a typical Santorini fashion. The village itself has a nice mixture of cream and white Cycladic houses with contrasting colourful wooden doors and a fair few white churches with bright blue domes for good measure. There are a couple of tiered bell towers over the road as you approach the square. There is one hotel in the centre The Vedema Resort and a few villas to rent, many with pool but of a traditional nature.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Artemis Studios"],["url=http:\/\/www.artemistudio.com\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=Built in a traditional way according to the Cycladic style, Artemis Studios is situated right on the caldera between Fira (the capital) and the most famous beaches of the island (black, red and white), offering a unique view of the volcano and the sunset."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Thermes Luxury Villas"],["url=http:\/\/www.thermesluxuryvillas.com\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+30 22860 28866"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=Seven villas all with private pools and magnificent views over the whole caldera."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Santorini"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["no Wikipedia link"]]}]
