Although the village of nearby Agarak is technically the crossing point into Iran, this is the last real town and the gateway for those entering.  The sheer jagged brown mountains here jut up from the thick waters of the Arax River.  The old mud adobe architecture of the town is crumbling, much of it replaced with Soviet, but parts of it remain for those who want a taste of a town with a very middle eastern flair.  There are a few churches, 2 of them are in very good condition and absolutely covered in frescoes inside.  A series of fortress\/fortifications above the city are some of the most recent in Armenia, only a couple of centuries old.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nMinibus\/Van (marshutni), bus, car, taxi from all points north in Armenia, or the border crossing in Iran.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nBy foot or car\/cab.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThe old churches, the older sections of town which surround them, the fortresses, the Arax River (but keep your distance!).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Mila Hotel"],["url="],["email="],["address=Adelyan 2nd Ln"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=(+374 2860) 3180, (091) 207142, 332745, (094) 350767"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=15-20,000"],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=Amenities: hot, cold water in Luxe rooms, TV in all rooms, refrigerator,"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Jemma's Hotel"],["url="],["email="],["address=5 Nshagortsner Str., Agarak village"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=A few km west of Meghri"],["phone=(+374 2860) 21480, (093) 415051, (091)275051"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=3-20,000"],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=Luxes have TV, hot\/cold water, heating"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Hotel Aygedzor"],["url="],["email="],["address=Aygedzor village"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=not in meghri!"],["phone=(+374 2860) 43340, (094) 602006"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=15.000 AMD (per room)"],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=hot, cold water, TV set, refrigerator, bathroom, toilet, restaurant, horse-riding, swimming pool, hunting (upon request), cow milking"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Haer B&B"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Follow the road north along the hill from the main square starting at the postoffice.
