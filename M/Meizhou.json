Getting to the correct bus station is the problem. Nevertheless you can get buses at Zhao Por Lu (literally grassy field road, ¥30).  Train is not practical because both trains land up in Meizhou in the middle of the night.\n\nThe long distance bus from Meizhou to Hong Kong, which happens to stop at the border crossing in Shenzhen which is not that far from HK costs ¥100. The bus makes the trip in about 4 hours but with the border cross at two points each way it takes just about 6 hours on the dot. Rail is about the same but twice the price but if you get boogered sitting in the last row of the bus behind the reclining seats you will regret it. Plus there are no facilities on the bus and it only stops once on the journey.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nMany private cars with driver will approach you for inexpensive travel within Meizhou and surrounding areas.\n\nThere are also three wheeled bicycles that are for hire. Usually for about ¥5-6 they will take you about two miles or so. They will try to get more so set the price beforehand. Taxis are a little bit more but not outrageous at all. Sometimes a private motorcycle will be waiting around on a street corner and they are for hire too for the adventurous. Traffic in Meizhou is a mind boggler and is just plain reckless. They will drive anywhere even the sidewalk and the wrong way on the streets and then mix the bicycles.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\njiaying university\n\nqianfoda\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nThis is Hakka country and generally speaking the bill of fare for the general public is noodles. You will pay about ¥6 for a bowl of noodles with some green leafy stuff thrown in. The food tends to be a bit bland and stodgy. There are no eggrolls but there is dim sum to a point. Dumplings usually are in the morning for breakfast, as well as, you guessed it, noodles, the breakfast of champions. As for eating street food, no stomach issues so be a little adventurous but if the place is a real dive then maybe stay away. It may gross you out to see them washing the dishes out of a dingy bucket of dirty water.\n\nThe bigger and better restaurants and hotels have a wider spectrum. Tofu from street vendors and is actually quite good and sort of a distant cousin to scrambled eggs.\nThere are plenty of places doing rice instead of noodles and although that is not much of a stretch it does help when you are noodled out. Fried rice is not the norm, usually it is a bowl of white rice with bowls of other stuff. Some of it, as at the Happy Restaurant on Ding Min Lu is quite tasty although the place looks like a warehouse instead of an eatery. The pork stuffed tofu is quite good but the pigs legs are not for the faint of heart.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nTo the UNESCO Heritage sites of the Tulous near Yongding, Fujian Province.Also a transit point to Taipu, another Hakka city from where it's a hop to Yongding,(by bus Y35), then a local bus Y11 to Wu Kang Village (or if you miss the late afternoon bus, by taxi Y100), the heart of the Tulou trails.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Northern Guangdong"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Meizhou"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["24.29977"],["116.11913"]]}]
