Its climate can be described generally as ",{"type":"'''","value":["temperate"]},", with warm summers and cool winters. During the summer of December to February, temperatures hover around 26–30°C (79–86°F), but it is not out of the ordinary for the city to swelter through heatwaves of over 40°C (104°F). Humidity is rarely an issue, with mildly comfortable nights down to about 16°C (61°F). With approximately 600mm of rainfall annually, Melbourne gets only half as much rain as Sydney. October is typically the wettest month.\n\nWinter (June–August) is usually cool with a mix of clear, sunny weather and cold & damp conditions. Temperatures in winter can range from chilly overnight lows as low 2 °C (36 °F) to daytime highs as high as 19 °C (66 °F) at times. Light snow has been recorded in and around Melbourne during the winter months only a couple of times over the last century, although the hills east of the city however usually see a snow shower or two every winter. You should consider visiting Melbourne in the autumn and spring — temperatures during these periods are usually very pleasant, without being unbearably warm with daytime highs are usually in the 20s °C (70s °F).\n\nWith such wild and unpredictable weather, it can be difficult deciding what to wear when planning a day out in Melbourne. A common tip is to wear layers of clothing, that can be removed or worn as the day goes on.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:St-Michael's-at-Night.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["St Michael's Uniting Church built in 1866"]]},"\nThe settlement of Melbourne commenced in 1835 when settlers from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tasmania"]]}," \"purchased\" land on Port Phillip Bay and the Yarra River from the local Aboriginal tribes. The streets of central Melbourne were carefully laid out in 1837, with some streets 30 metres wide. The settlement was named \"Melbourne\" after William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, the British Prime Minister at that time. The first British lieutenant-governor, Charles La Trobe, arrived in 1839 – his Cottage still stands and can be visited in the Kings Domain. The year 1851 was a landmark for Melbourne — the colony of Victoria was separated from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New South Wales"]]}," and very soon after,  gold was discovered in Victoria, sparking a huge goldrush. Aspects of the gold rush history can be seen at the Gold Treasury Museum, housed in the Treasury Building built in 1858. Gold was the catalyst for several decades of prosperity lasting through to the late 1880s and examples of the ornate Victorian-era structures built during this time still stand. In 1888,  the property boom collapsed and Victoria suffered the depression of the 1890s. Throughout the gold and building booms, Melbourne managed to retain its many spacious parks and gardens and these remain to this day.\n\nIn 1901,  the British colonies of Australia became an independent federation and Melbourne the temporary capital of Australia, with the Federal Parliament meeting in the Parliament House of Victoria until 1927 when the new Federal capital of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Canberra"]]}," was founded. After World War II,  Melbourne grew rapidly, with its mainly Anglo-Celtic population boosted by immigration from Europe, particularly from Greece and Italy. Today Melbourne has the biggest Greek city population (over 800,000) outside Greece and the biggest Italian city population (over 230,000) outside Italy. The significant pre-war Jewish population was also boosted after the war. From the mid-70s,  many immigrants came from South-east Asia, particularly Vietnam and Cambodia. Melbourne has had a Chinese population since the gold rush of the 1850s and Chinatown has existed from that time but the population of Chinese and other East Asians has also been boosted by immigration in recent years.\n\nNew highrise buildings replaced many of Melbourne’s interesting old structures in the construction boom of the 1970s and 80s. Melbournians belatedly recognised the loss of their architectural heritage and steps were taken to protect what was left. Construction of the huge Crown Casino (briefly the largest casino in the world) in the 1990s upset some Melbournians with its introduction of a gambling culture. Melbourne’s development continues in the 2000s with the opening of the Melbourne Museum, Federation Square and the Docklands precinct.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Culture"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Henry Moore - Draped seated woman (1958 Bronze).jpg"],["thumb"],["left"],["Grimwade gardens, ground level of NGV"]]},"\nMelbourne is often called the cultural capital of Australia,  with its many art galleries, film festivals, orchestras, choral and opera productions, vibrant live music scene, and a strong food, wine and coffee culture. People in Melbourne tend to dress up more than in Sydney, partly due to the colder climate.  Many bars and clubs have strict dress regulations, such as requiring collars and dress shoes for men.\n\nParticular events to note include the Melbourne International Film Festival in August, the International Art Festival in October, and the Melbourne Comedy Festival in April.  There are also many concerts and exhibitions throughout the year. In addition to the Melbourne Museum, there are special museums dedicated to subjects such as science, immigration, Chinese history, Jewish history, sport, racing, film and moving image, railways, police, fire brigades and banking.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Sport"]},"\n\nMelbournians are sports enthusiasts and particularly passionate about Australian Rules football ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/afl.com.au\/"]},", a sport invented in Melbourne.

In addition, you will have to learn how to execute a hook turn (described in a later paragraph) due to the large number of trams in the city. That being said, driving is generally the best way of getting around Melbourne's suburbs, as the public transportation network tends to be less reliable and more thinly spread out than in the CBD, particularly in the outer suburbs.

You can do this by phone, Internet, or at some Shell petrol stations.  The registered owner of the car will get a fine in the mail if you do not buy a pass within 3 days.  The tolled sections are indicated with blue and yellow signs, rather than the standard green and white.  CityLink can cut a worthwhile amount of time from your journey, especially if you are driving from, say, the south-eastern suburbs to Melbourne Airport.

Melbourne is also famous for its many trendy bars in the CBD.  Most of these, however, are down narrow alleys and streets, and are therefore hard to find unless you know where you are going.\n\nThe inner northern suburbs, such as Collingwood and Fitzroy cater for the young, laid-back, and bohemian crowd.

However there are plenty of alleyway bars, once you find one they seem to pop up everywhere you look. Melbourne's clubs often market a members only rule which can upset your more upmarket traveler. The rule is in place to prevent fighting and unappealing groups of men entering a nice club and destroying the atmosphere.\n\nAustralian licensing laws are very similar to those in the UK, i.e. you are not allowed to be drunk on licensed premises.

Some pubs and clubs are quicker to eject patrons than others, but it's only ever a short walk to another. Licensing is more liberal then what one may be used to, as you can still expect to find a drink past 2AM.  This has lead to a culture of late night drinking where some venues won't get busy until some time after 11PM, especially true during summer.\n\nMelburnians often draw a distinction between 'bars', meaning the small watering holes described above, and 'pubs' which are larger establishments in the usual Australian or British sense of the word. Melbourne's pubs, particularly those in the city and inner suburbs, usually serve restaurant-standard food and a wide range of local and imported beers.

Some parts of Melbourne are best avoided after hours though, primarily some parts of the western suburbs. Gang and racial violence is an issue although the Government has announced a state wide crack down on un-social and violent behavior with large police presence and train station PSO's. Caution is needed to be exercise after hours around bars and clubs, where fights often occur.\n\nWhile Melbourne is a very safe city for its size, the usual precautions still apply as for any large city, including keeping valuables hidden and avoiding solo night travel.\n\nSome areas, such as Collingwood and Footscray, are safe during the day but can be dangerous at night.  These two areas have a heavy police presence, though, so provided you stick to main streets (e.g., for Collingwood, Smith Street), you should be fine.  Outer-suburban areas like Dandenong, Sunshine and Ringwood do not have a heavy police presence, and in the unlikely event a traveler would visit them, are areas of high risk caution would be warranted. If you stay on well lit, well traveled streets, you should be fine, but be alert.\n\nMelbourne's red-light districts include King Street, known for its concentration of strip clubs, and certain parts of St Kilda (in particular Grey Street, Inkerman Street and Greeves Street) where there is some illegal street prostitution.  Even so, you are more likely to be harassed by drunken revelers and street walkers than you are to be actually threatened.  Melbourne City Council has established all-night \"Safe City\" taxi ranks with security guards on King Street, outside Flinders Street Station and on Bourke Street.\n\nIf you travel by train at night, stay in the front carriage close to the driver's area and note emergency buttons. If a problem occurs, push emergency buttons on the train or railway station to attract attention. Stay in ",{"type":"'''","value":["Safety Zones"]}," while on stations at night. These are marked with yellow lines and are usually well lit and have emergency buttons as well as about 4 cameras pointed at the area.  Robberies on trains are rare, but it occasionally happens (and when it does, at night).  Railway police patrol most services.  In early 2010, there were attacks on Indian students, sometimes claimed to be racially motivated.\n\nIf you are driving your own car or rented automobile, beware of car theft or break-in. Avoid temptation by hiding valuables out of sight, and always lock the car and leave the windows up before you leave. If you are waiting in your car, lock the car as well. A police officer will always show ID before asking you to open your door or window.\n\nPickpocketing is rare in Melbourne, but be aware of your belongings out the front of Flinders Street Station and the first block of Swanston Street (between Flinders and Collins Streets).\n\nBeggars frequent the southern ends of Elizabeth and Swanston Streets, Bourke Street Mall, and the intersection of Bourke with Exhibition and Russell Streets. You can also expect to be persistently targeted if seated outdoors at a pub or cafe in the city.  Verbal abuse and intimidation by beggars is uncommon but by no means unknown.\n\nAlthough ",{"type":"'''","value":["scams"]}," are rare in Melbourne, be wary of ",{"type":"'''","value":["real estate agents"]}," (especially if you have newly arrived and plan to stay only for the short term). There have been many cases of real estate agents preying upon overseas students in particular. Common scams include charging tenants for costs that don't exist (such as  charges for 'advertising' when tenants move out) and deducting costs for non-existent reparations and cleaning from the bond. Be sure to consult the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.tuv.org.au\/ Tenants Union of Victoria"]}," and know your rights when you are charged for anything and move in and out.\n\nTake ",{"type":"'''","value":["extreme care"]}," when crossing tram tracks in and around Melbourne. Trams tend run very fast in Melbourne to avoid disruption with the traffic. There have been recent cases of pedestrians being hit by trams, which can cause life-threatening injuries or even instant death. Even if a tram has passed, look on the other side in case there is another tram approaching, as trams often run practically nose-to-tail, especially in Elizabeth Street.\n\nIntensive solicitation of pedestrians by corporations and activist groups ('chuggers') has become common in the city.  Many resort to intrusive tactics such as blocking your path or occupying all four corners of a street intersection. They are not after a one-off donation, but to sign you up to a regular contribution plan from your credit card or bank account (from which they receive a substantial percentage).\n\nThe infamous ",{"type":"'''","value":["Melbourne gangland war"]}," that claimed many lives is now over and despite anything you see on the media having to do with it, violent criminal occurrences are very rare and isolated. As long you are not involved with Melbourne's underworld, you do not have anything to worry about.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Port Melbourne Beacon Cove.jpg"],["thumb"],["190px"],["Beacon Cove Beach, Port Melbourne"]]},"\nMelbourne is fairly centrally located on the coast of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Victoria (state)"],["Victoria"]]},", and there are many natural and man-made attractions that make for a nice day trip.
