The terminals are contained within one building, or within easy walking distance of each other.  As a gateway to Australia, it has many advantages over other capital cities that are curfew restricted and have complex or expensive arrangements to transfer from international to domestic flights.\n\nThe airport has four terminals. T1, T2 T3 are in the same building, and it is easy to walk to T4, however each terminal has separate security screening, and access between terminals is not available once in the sterile area.\n",{"type":"*","value":["T1 (the \"North Terminal\") is used by Qantas ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.qantas.com.au\/"]}," and Jetstar ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.jetstar.com\/"]}," domestic services."]},{"type":"*","value":["T2 (the \"International Terminal\") is used by all international airlines.

There are two airport pickup locations. One is outside the Virgin Australia\/REX terminal (T3), 50 m from the international terminal (T2). The other is outside the Qantas\/Jetstar domestic terminal (T1). There are ticket desks at both T1 and T3, and if unattended, tickets can be purchased electronically or from the driver.\n\nThe trip takes around 20 minutes (in good traffic) and runs directly using the freeway with no stops. It costs $18\/30 adult one-way\/return, $6 child one-way (4–14 years of age). There are also several family ticket options available.  Frequency ranges from half-hourly 1–4AM, to every 10 minutes 5:30AM–11PM. They also run a connection service between the terminal and central hotels\/hostels during the day (M–F 6AM–10:30PM, Sa–Su 7:30AM–5:30PM), and this is included in your fare.  Otherwise, you can board any train at Southern Cross Station, or take a tram down Collins St through the city centre. Bookings are not needed for travel from the airport to hotels, but on the way back, book hotel pick-up at least three hours ahead.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By public bus "]},"\n\nMelbourne airport has some public buses as well.\n\nIf money is more important than time and convenience, you can take public bus 901 to Broadmeadows station (every 15 min, travel time 20 min) and switch to a train to the city (every 20 min or less, travel time around 40 min).  Both buses and trains run from 5AM to midnight, although Broadmeadows is one of Melbourne's sketchier suburbs and you'll want to be careful after dark.  The trip costs $5.92 and you will need a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Ticket"],["Myki"]]}," smartcard to pay for it.  There are machines that dispense myki cards in the arrivals area of T1-T3, and outside the arrivals terminal door at T4.  The buses depart from outside the Qantas domestic terminal, right at the far left of the bus departures area that runs the length of the terminal.  There are some signs.  \n\nIf you are using public transport to travel around Melbourne on the day you arrive, this method represents even better value.  The from Broadmeadows can go to Flinders St, that is usually more convenient to the city centre than Southern Cross.\n\nThe buses display the next stop, and there will usually be others getting off at Broadmeadows station.  If you are doing the route in reverse, the bus stop is immediately outside the station, and there is a electronic signage timing the next bus arrival.\n\nThe 500 bus travels to Broadmeadows too, although less frequently.  \n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By shuttle "]},"\n\nAlternatively, if heading to southern Melbourne (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Melbourne\/St Kilda"],["St Kilda"]]}," and points beyond), the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Frankston and Peninsula Airport Shuttle"]}," (FAPAS) ",{"type":"[","value":["https:\/\/www.fapas.com.au\/"]}," runs roughly-hourly minibus services, advance bookings required either on-line or at +61 3 9783-1199.  Full adult fares from $18, but there are group discounts and some hostels even offer free rides if you stay for three or more nights.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By taxi "]},"\n\nA taxi into the Melbourne CBD will cost around $60 and take around 30 minutes.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By rental car "]},"\nSix ",{"type":"'''","value":["car rental"]}," companies have offices and facilities on-site. All of them have information desks where bookings can be made in the domestic terminals. Considering the high cost of using taxis, it may be cheaper to hire for a few days if you want to really explore Melbourne and its surroundings. \n\nNote that the motorway into Melbourne is a toll road, and cameras will scan your licence plate. All the on-airport rental car companies have some option to pay, or you have up to three days after you travel to buy a Tulla Pass for $5.25.  Or, if you are spending longer in Melbourne then you can buy another passes that will halve the price, but charge you a setup fee such that is it isn't worthwhile for a single trip to the airport and back.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Avis"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.avis.com.au"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+61 3 9338 1800"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Budget"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.budget.com.au"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+61 3 9241 6366"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Europcar"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.europcar.com.au"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+61 3 9241 6800"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Hertz"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.hertz.com.au"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+61 3 9338 4044"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Thrifty"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.thrifty.com.au"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+61 3 9241 6100"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Redspot"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.redspot.com.au"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+61 2 8303 2222"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Wait"]},"\nMelbourne Airport is navigated purely by walking.
