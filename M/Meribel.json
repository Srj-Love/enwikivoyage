[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.meribel.net Meribel"]}]}," is a name for three villages in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Savoie"]]}," department of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["France"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nMeribel, in France, is best accessed via train from Paris which goes direct to near-by Moutiers Salins where a short bus or taxi ride will take you to Meribel centre and surrounding areas. Eurostar offers direct services from London and Ashford on Friday evenings and Saturday mornings to Moutiers, returning on Saturday (morning or evening). \n\nOther ways of getting to Meribel include flying to Geneva, Lyon, Grenoble or Chambery and transferring via bus or taxi. It is possible to drive to Meribel, but this is probably not the best way as traffic around the Alps can be awful and the mountain roads are rather hard to negotiate.\n\nThere is a direct coach service from London, stopping at a few other places in England which can give 8 days skiing, a very favourable low-cost option for the budget traveller.\n\nThe Olympe cable car links Meribel to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brides les Bains"]]}," at the foot of the Alps, via ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Les Allués"]]},".  The ride takes 26 minutes in small 6 seater cabins.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nMeribel is a large resort by Alps standards but the best way to explore Meribel centre is by walking. If you are staying in surrounding villages, a bus service operates 7 days a week.\n\nFor example, you can drive to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bozel"]]},", in the Tarentaise Valley.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nMeribel offers some of the best ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alpine Skiing"]]}," in the Alps and other resorts such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Courchevel"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Les Menuires"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Val Thorens"]]}," can be accessed via the extensive lift network.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nChez Kiki is a little steak place run and owned by an old French chap called Kiki. Their steaks are legendary but as with most restaurants in the Alps, extremely pricey and a 3 course meal with wine is likely to set you back at least 100 euros per head.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nLe Pub, Barometer, the Tavern and Dick's Tea Bar are some of the most popular night spots in Meribel and are generally full of, and run by, English people. Dick's Tea Bar is open until 5am most nights. Be prepared to spend lots of money in these places, a pint of beer can set you back as much as 6-8 euros.\n\nThe Rond Point, locally known as 'Ronnies' is possibly one of the most famous Apres-Ski spots in the world and is the only place to go for drinks on the slopes. Again, prices are eye-watering but the atmosphere is fantastic. Open to 7pm daily.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Pierre & Vacances"],["url=http:\/\/www.pv-holidays.com\/alps\/meribel\/holiday-rental-france-meribel_de"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+33 1 58 21 55 84"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=€700-2500 per week"],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=Runs and manages 8 resorts\/apartment complexes in Meribel"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Purple Ski"],["url=http:\/\/www.purpleski.com\/"],["email="],["address=Chalet Aigle, Sous Le Four, Le Villaret"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone =+33 4 79 01 05 31"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=An independent chalet operator in Meribel that have 4 chalets to offer.
