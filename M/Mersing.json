It is 136 Kilometres north east of the state capital ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Johor Bahru"]]},". It is a gateway to nature and traditional culture. But for most outsiders the small semi-tourist town is hardly more than a few-hours rest en route to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tioman Island"]]},". Mersing town is thus best known for its passenger boat jetty where boats depart daily for numerous offshore islands.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nDespite its estimated population of 21,000, Mersing town should not be viewed as a mere stopover, a transient path to an offshore isle. The town possesses a quiet charm that in many ways represents a fast disappearing small-town culture that once pervaded all of Malaysia. It has yet to see any typical signs of major economic and urban development. \n\nTwo main roads run through the town. There only two junctions with traffic lights and only two traffic roundabouts. The two main roads are lined with traditional and modern shop houses that provide a range of modern services. There are traditional fruit sellers, grocers and modern supermarkets, plus a range of local restaurants and fast food outlets, several open 24-hours.\n\nMersing is a throwback to the small town look and temperament that existed in Malaysia some 20 or 30 years ago. There is little if at all in the way of chic clubs, cafes or shopping malls. The town's appeal lies rather in its out-of-doors, its slow-paced life and natural surroundings such as jungle reserves and unspoiled beaches, rocky coasts and offshore kelongs for pleasure angling. Air Papan and Penyabung beaches are about 15 and 30 minutes drive north of the town respectively. There you can glimpse the remaining vestiges of traditional seaside Malay village life. A must do is to circumambulate the centrally orientated hill that shoots up right behind the Hindu temple, very near to the roundabout, a short walk from the bridge.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nSeveral bus companies operate direct services to Mersing, e.g. ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/transnasional.com.my Transnasional"]}," from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kuala Lumpur"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Malacca"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Singapore"]]},", while others that use the east coast highway (e.g. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Johor Bahru"]]}," to\/from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kota Bahru"]]},") also call at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mersing"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["From Malacca"]},", take the S&S International from Central Bus Station (it's the only direct bus).
