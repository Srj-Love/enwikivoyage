Nearly the entire population of 15,000 works for Qatar Petroleum, who also have a monopoly over local services and schools.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Mesaieed mosque.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Mesaieed mosque"]]},"\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Route 109"]}," bus (",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/eng.mowasalat.com\/mritems\/streams\/2007\/3\/4\/1_557_1_11.pdf timetable"]},") runs from ",{"type":"''","value":["Al Ghanim Bus Station"]}," in Doha to Mesaieed and back, with approximately half an hour frequency and one hour journey time to the town centre.
