Be sure to verify days\/times beforehand. It has beautifully-restored wagons dated from 1904 and once was owned by the Bey of Tunis. It's painted a deep-red with gold trim on the outside. Inside, the interior is very luxurious with brocaded armchairs, overhead antique-globed lighting, brass fittings and mahogany panels. Wide roll-down windows on both sides offered views over the passing landscape that delight the eyes. Young waiters dressed in period garb and white gloves passed through with cold drinks. All in all, though geared only to tourists (cost: about $18 USD), it is a unique reminder of an unhurried time and well worth the special detour from Tozeur. If you are going as an individual, verify beforehand and get to the train station early. As 90% of the passengers were in pre-arranged tour groups, the train fills up."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["34.3167"],["8.4000"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Saharan Tunisia"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:MÃ©tlaoui"]]}]
