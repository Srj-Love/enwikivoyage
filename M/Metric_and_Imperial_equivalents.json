In the US, you'll find the metric system only used in scientific or military contexts, while in the UK and Canada, usage is more mixed. In scientific usage, the metric system is used exclusively in all countries of the world.\n\nTo get by in countries that use a different system than you're used to, it's helpful to know some rough equivalents.
