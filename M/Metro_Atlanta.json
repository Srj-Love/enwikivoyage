Gwinnett and Cobb Counties boast a great environment for people who want to leave the city and explore nature. For example, a really good place to go is Stone Mountain Park, which is in Northern Dekalb County. It is a great tourist attraction for families and people who love the environment. It has a beautiful lake and a plantation on it, which is open for tours for a history buff. \n\nAlso in Cobb County, is the Cobb Galleria. This holds amazing Broadway plays and shows, shopping, and much more. Also, for the family Six Flags is a great place to go (but not at night) to have family fun. \n\nIn Hall County, which is a short ride up Interstate 75, is Lake Lanier. It is a huge lake with boating and many other tourist attractions. Lake Lanier Islands is a water park and resort for a family.\n\nIn Gwinnett, you might also want to visit Historic Lawrenceville, Historic Lilburn, or Historic Duluth. These places have fountains and old buildings that are immaculately preserved. Make sure to visit these places in Gwinnett County.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nLocated in Northern Georgia, Metropolitan Atlanta is a diverse set of people who are different from county to county. Centered by Atlanta (Fulton County), and out skirted by Gwinnett, Cobb, Hall, Forsyth, Walton, Dekalb, Clayton, and Gilmer just to name a few. The Metro Atlanta area has 28 large Counties spreading from the Georgia-Alabama Border, east to Athens, south to about Macon, and north to Jasper. It is over about 8,376 square miles and holds over 5,475,213 people, making it the ninth largest metropolitan area in the United States.\n\nWith no natural features to constrain its growth, Atlanta tends to grow out rather than up, leading to massive ",{"type":"'''","value":["urban sprawl"]},". Atlanta is also at the junction of three major U.S. Interstate Highways, which contributes to its reputation as a driving city.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nMany people assume Atlanta is hot during the summer. They're right, but it's not as bad as it sounds; overzealous air conditioning and sweet iced tea make it bearable. If you do spend time outside, shorts and sandals are the norm from May to September. Autumn is mild, but temperatures can stay high through October before really dropping. Winters are unpredictable; most years see some freezing temperatures, but a couple days of sunshine can unexpectedly bring the temperature to the 60s or higher. Anything more than a dusting of snow is uncommon; when it happens, drivers will forget how to drive, stores will sell out of eggs and milk, and schools and businesses will shut down. The more usual problem is ice, which happens when daytime temperatures rise just enough to melt the snow, which then refreezes on the streets overnight. Spring is mostly marked by an unpredictable rainy season, interrupted by a torrent of pollen that turns every car in the city a dusty yellow for two weeks.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nMost of the people you'll encounter will speak standard American English, more or less, but you ",{"type":"''","value":["will"]}," hear people with a thick southern drawl.

If you say these to locals they'll know you're a visitor.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Hartsfield-Jackson overview.jpg"],["thumb"],["240px"],["Atlanta's airport, the busiest in the world"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nMetro Atlanta is serviced by ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport"]]}]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["ATL"]]},"), often referred to by locals as \"Hartsfield-Jackson,\" \"Atlanta,\" \"ATL,\" or simply \"the airport.\" It is located about ten miles south of downtown Atlanta, so you will need to take public transit, a cab, or a rental car in to the city.\n\nAtlanta has been the world's busiest airport since 1999, and is a major hub for Delta Air Lines and AirTran Airways. Although most passengers fly through Atlanta as a connection rather than a destination, few complain about the airport, which has excellent service and a largely headache-free layout (unlike other large airports like Chicago-O'Hare).\n\nSeveral other airports serve general aviation traffic around Atlanta, including DeKalb-Peachtree Airport (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["PDK"]]},") and Fulton County Airport (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["FTY"]]},").\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nAtlanta is served by ",{"type":"'''","value":["Amtrak"]}," on the Crescent Line, with direct service to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New York City"],["New York"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Philadelphia"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Baltimore"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Washington D.C."],["Washington"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Charlotte"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Birmingham (Alabama)"],["Birmingham"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Orleans"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nAtlanta has a rail\/bus system, and surrounding counties have some buses as well, but the fastest and most reliable way to see Metro Atlanta is by ",{"type":"'''","value":["car"]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By public transit"]},"\n\n",{"type":"''","value":["See ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Atlanta#By transit"]]},"."]}," Outside Atlanta, the bus systems are primarily for commuters, and will be of so little use to you that you might as well ignore them.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nBecause of its massive urban sprawl and highways running in every direction, Atlanta has always been a car city.

Highways are up to 7 lanes wide in each direction, and drivers weave back and forth with little regard for lane ettiquette or turn signals. As an unwritten rule, the police do not generally stop highway drivers for going 60-75 if they are keeping up with traffic; unfortunately this means if you ",{"type":"''","value":["do"]}," get stopped, you will probably have a massive ticket for going 20mph or more over the speed limit.\n\nUnfortunately, the interstate highways really are the best to get around metro Atlanta. U.S. Highways are generally urban arteries with low speed limits, lots of lights and lots of traffic. Only about a half-dozen of the Georgia State Routes in metro Atlanta are limited-access.\n\nThe best thing you can do is keep pace with traffic and be alert for drivers around you who ",{"type":"''","value":["will"]}," pull hazardous maneuvers.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Highways and nicknames"]},"\nIn conversation, higways in Atlanta are referred to by number: 75, 85, 285, and 400 (but usually I-20, oddly enough).\n\nI-285 forms a complete loop around the city with about a 10-mile radius. This is known as \"the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Perimeter"]},"\".

These lanes are for vehicles with 2 or more people (including the driver), motorcycles, and clean fuel vehicles (which must be licensed with a alternative fuel license plate). They are in effect 24\/7, and there is a hefty fine if you're caught using the HOV lanes when you're not eligible.\n\nThe HOV lanes can only be entered or exited where the double white line is dashed, not solid, although this is rarely enforced.\n\nThere are a few highway entrances and exits on the left which are only usable if you are eligible for the HOV lanes.

Sidewalks are often narrow—when they are present at all—and reckless drivers who speed and run red lights make it unpleasant, if not dangerous, to walk. Moreover, things are so spread out that it's impractical to do much of anything if you walk there.\n\nA few tightly-knit parts of town are walkable. Downtown is fairly pedestrian-friendly, as is Midtown to a lesser degree. Virginia-Highlands and Decatur are both great for walking, especially if you're bar-hopping.

Only consider biking if you're practiced at sharing the road in an aggressive urban environment.\n\nThe good news is that MARTA allows bicycles on all buses and trains. On buses, you must use the bike racks, which hold 2 bikes and are first-come, first-served.\n\nThere's a long multi-use path from Midtown through Decatur out to Stone Mountain.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Itineraries"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nThe most notable shopping malls\/districts in Metro Atlanta are:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Lenox Mall"]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Buckhead"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Atlantic Station"]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Atlanta\/Midtown"]]},", a newly-developed pedestrian-friendly shopping district intermixed with moderately upscale restaurants."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Discover Mills"]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lawrenceville"]]},".
