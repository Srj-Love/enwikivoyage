[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Mevagissey"]}," is a picturesque fishing village on the south coast of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cornwall"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nEnjoy time wandering around the harbour and the shops, eating Cornish pasty's or ice cream (a recipe for a heart attack, according to a local GP!). There's a number of restaurants and pubs and it's a good base for visiting local attractions such as the Lost Gardens of Heligan and the Eden project.\n\nThere's a large car park as you enter the village which is a good place to stop since the lanes ahead get quite narrow and busy, especially in the Summer months.\n\nThe winter months are also a great time to visit, especially over New Year where everyone dresses up in fancy dress and wander between the pubs.\n\nMevagissey is pronounced 'Mevagizzey', with the stress on the penultimate syllable i.e.'gizz'\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nIf you are driving, you need to take the A390 to St Austell and turn off at McDonalds. If you are coming from Exeter or beyond, the A30 into Cornwall is half an hour quicker than the A38 via Plymouth. \n\nThere is a mainline train service through St Austell, and a regular bus service from St Austell to Mevagissey.  National Express also stop at St Austell.  \n\nNewquay airport is only about 45 minutes drive away, and there are an expanding range of air services flying into Newquay these days - try Air South West, BA and Ryanair.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nBest not to try to drive around the village while you are here - unless you like squeezing past other cars and pedestrians in the very narrow streets.  Park up and walk!  The harbour car park is the best value, and this helps to support the harbour, which is a charity.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nMost people come to see the harbour and its fishing boats.  The Aquarium and Museum, both on the harbourside, are also worth a look.  Both are charities and rely on donations from visitors.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nFeast week is an annual event in June when there's a carnival, live music, dancing, processions, raft races etc.  It is always the week with the 29th of June in it (St Peter's day - patron saint of fishermen and of the local parish church).  If the 29th is a Sunday, as it is in 2008, that is the first day of Feast Week. \n\nIn July and August you can take an hour trip around the bay on one of the local fishing boats, or hire a self-drive motor boat from the Aquarium slipway.\n\nThe Lost Gardens of Heligan are less than a mile away as the crow flies (OK, a bit further by car), but you can walk up through the valley via the cyclepath, or footpath through Heligan Mill - although the latter can get very muddy.  Nice cafe at the gardens.\n\nVisit the Mevagissey museum its very interesting and free. You can find it on the left hand side of the harbour\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Alvorada"]},", formerly at 2 Polkirt Hill but now in Church Street - you'll see it when you drive in on the one way system, 01726 842055.
