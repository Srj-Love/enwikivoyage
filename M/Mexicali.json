[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Mexicali"]}," (also known informally as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Chicali"]},") is a city in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Baja California"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mexico"]]},". It is the capital of the state of Baja California, and is located immediately across the border from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Calexico"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["California"]]},". While cool throughout the rest of the year, visitors can expect a very hot climate during the summer months with average high temperatures ranging from 101 ºF to 108ºF (38° to 42°C). ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mexicali"]]}," has a population of around 1.0 million people according to the last census, although it is believed that the number is now closer to 1.5 million. The city has grown from a small border town to a modern city with a sizable middle class and an even bigger upper class. The standard of living is the highest in Mexico. It is recognized in Mexico for its sizable investment in education and low unemployment. It is a progressive city with main industry that has gone from agricultural to industrial. Its proximity to the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United States"]]}," has made it a very popular tourist destination, especially for day-trippers. Recent violence has curtailed that traffic, however.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Districts\/Boroughs"]},"\n\nMexicali has 14 boroughs, which are comprised of 1 city municipal seat and 13 other boroughs which are in the valley area. The city seat can be further divided by Colonias and Fraccionamientos. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nEconomically, a growing middle class disposable income has fueled Mexicali's transformation into a modern city with a vibrant culture, a characteristic that has attracted many national and international businesses which had largely ignored the city before and had turned to Tijuana. Aside from the middle class, in Mexicali you can expect to find areas filled with very rich people. Mexicali is considered among the most prosperous cities in Mexico, although US tourists can observe the level of poverty in rural villages surrounding the modern, upper-middle class enclave of Mexicali proper. The North American Free Trade Agreement of 1994 that eliminated most trade restrictions between the two nations offers Mexicali an economic boom in the next decade. Mexicali is a transit point for illegal immigration into the United States, as well as a common destination for any illegal Mexican immigrants deported from the West Coast of the United States. As such, some areas are swollen with poor people with no roots in the city, who inhabit shantytowns, mainly in the outskirts of the city. Apart from these poor migrants, Mexicali is one of the wealthiest cities in Mexico. Some areas of the city reflect the significant number of wealthy people who inhabit the city, in areas such as San Pedro, Villafontana, and Col Nueva.\n\nMexicali's growing reputation as a cosmopolitan city is justified. Not only is the city home to many people who have migrated from within the same country, as well as some native Mexican Indians, but it boasts an important amount of Asian residents (especially Chinese), as well as Americans, Europeans, and South Americans. Informally, Mexicali natives are known as \"",{"type":"'''","value":["Cachanillas"]},"\" (similar demonyms include \"Chilango\" for those from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mexico City"]]},").\n\nMexicali is known mainly as a business and industry town, but has an excellent reputation for hospitality and tourism in the country. \n\nMexicali is known as \"the city that captured the sun\". Its residents frequently joke regarding its extreme heat during the summer, reaching record desert temperatures. Mexicali's primary newspapers are La Voz de la Frontera and La Cronica de Baja California. It is served by three television stations (Televisa [with 4 analog and 2 digital signals], TV Azteca [2 analog and 2 digital signals] and Canal Once) along with the television stations in the United States in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Imperial County"]]}," market (NBC, CBS, FOX, ABC, CW, MNTV, Univision, Telemundo, and Telefutura). \n\nWhile the Mexican peso is the legal currency, US dollars are widely accepted. Mexicali observes daylight savings time (DST) and is in the Pacific Time Zone the same way as the USA.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Chinese community"]},"\nMexicali has one of the largest Chinese communities in Mexico. Historically, it has been a predominantly Chinese town and has even hosted the North American headquarters of the Kuomintang (KMT) at one point. Many old-time Chinese-Mexican natives of Mexicali have since intermarried with the local mestizos or emigrated to the United States.

The emergency number is 066. Avoid giving out money to beggars and homeless people standing in the street or along sidewalks and avoid buying things off the street to avoid trouble later.\n\nDo not buy illegal drugs to avoid becoming part of the ongoing violence. Overstocking yourself with prescription drugs will also warrant getting checked. While partying and clubbing in Mexico is all in good fun and allright, keep in mind that you will not get away with it because it is Mexico. You probably will get caught and kept a special eye on because you are an American, even if you look Latino.\n\nIf you do anything unlawful, even if you are underage, you will spend time in prison. You do not get preferential treatment because you are an American citizen. While there is no need to have to hide the fact that you are an American, the flamboyant and flagrant exposition of self-thought superiority is not welcome, in good taste, or tolerated, like anywhere else in the world. Keep in mind that Mexico uses kilometers and not miles, and speed limits are much slower than in the United States.\n\nPlease do not try to bribe the Mexican police officers, even if they are hinting at it. If you try to bribe, you will go to prison. Driving while using a cellphone or a radio without a handsfree device is illegal in the state of Baja California and it will get you ticketed. Trying to bargain prices will sometimes help, but in most places in Mexicali today it is not practiced and such behavior will be ignored.  \n\nDo not be caught with any type of weapon in Mexico. This can include a small pocket knife, or even ammunition or bullet casings. American motorists have been jailed for driving into Mexico with spent ammunition casings in their car trunk.\n\nIn the unlikely event of a major earthquake, duck and cover and stay where you are during the shaking, then go outside once the shaking stops. Buildings and other structures are unlikely to collapse. Your largest threats come from breaking windows and falling objects such as ceiling tiles and bookshelves. Try to get under a table, desk, or doorjam to reduce your exposure to these threats. You are more likely to be injured if you try to run during the shaking.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\nWhile the city's restaurants are registered by the Health Department and clean water is available city-wide, eating at roadside taco shops and drinking tap water is discouraged because one that is not used to this will probably get food poisoning. Avoid any foods you are not used to. Bottled water, gasified and pure, is available widely and you are encouraged to drink of it. \n\nIf you need emergency medical treatment, it is preferred that you attend a private hospital and call 066, attending a public hospital or a Seguro Social hospital will be futile, as they are only for registered Mexican citizens and have problems getting medical attention there. There are drugstores and private medical and dental clinics throughout the city.\n\nA prescription from a licensed doctor in Mexico is needed to fill prescription drugs in any pharmacy in Baja California.
