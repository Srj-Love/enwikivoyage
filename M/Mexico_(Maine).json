There is a small logoon type area created by the force of the spring run off that is great for smaller children and supervised non-swimmers. For swimmers there is a deep pool, usually safe for diving, and small waterfalls which are a favorite to sit under on a hot day. The park also provides a children's playground, basketball and tennis courts and a snack bar with facilities. Just adjacent to the large open field are two ball fields that are heavily used by local youth and adult sports clubs.

The deep pool is a perfect respite from the summer heat. On occasion locals will bring along a bar of soap to wash up, but skinnydipping is usually limited to late night hours when it is dark. Locals maintain a rope swing tied to the underside of the bridge, and the more daring jump off the bridge when the water is high enough. However, there are no lifeguards and it is important to know just where to jump to avoid injury. Only people with good swimming skills should consider this location due to the depth of the water."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Dick's Pizza"],["url="],["email="],["address=Bridge Street"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Maddy's Pizza Shop"],["url="],["email="],["address=148 Main Street"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +1 207  364-2051"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Mexico, Maine"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["44.56083"],["-70.54528"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Lakes and Mountains"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North_America\/United_States\/Maine\/Localities\/M\/Mexico\/"]]}]
