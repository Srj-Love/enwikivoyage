It is shaped roughly like an oval of about 60 km by 40 km, built on the dry bed of Lake Texcoco, and surrounded on three sides by tall mountains and volcanoes such as the Ajusco, the Popocatepetl and the Ixtaccihuatl.  Mexico City proper (with an estimated population of between 8 to 9 million) is in the Federal District (Spanish: ",{"type":"''","value":["Distrito Federal"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["D.F."]},"), a federally-administered area (that is, not part of any Mexican state) which acts as the capital of Mexico.

Knowing what colonia you're going to is essential to getting around, and almost all locals will know where a given colonia is (but note that there are some colonias with duplicate or very similar names). As with many very large cities, the structure is relatively decentralized, with several parts of the city having their own miniature \"downtown areas.\" However, the real downtown areas are Centro, the old city center, and Zona Rosa, the new business and entertainment district.\n\nThe city is located 2200 m above mean sea level. Some people have breathing difficulties at high places and have experienced difficulty when breathing. The altitude is equivalent to more than 7,200 ft.  This is far higher than any metropolitan area in the United States. If you live closer to sea level, you may experience difficulty breathing due to altitude and pollution. Air quality has, however, been improved in the last few years.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Ciudad.de.Mexico.City.Distrito.Federal.DF.Paseo.Reforma.Skyline.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["250px"],["Skyline of Reforma skyscrapers"]]},"\nMexico City's night life is like all other aspects of the city; it is huge. There is an enormous selection of venues: clubs, bars, restaurants, cafes, and variations and combinations thereof to choose from. There is incredible variation, from ultramodern lounges in Santa Fe and Reforma, to centuries-old dance halls in Centro and Roma. There are also pubs in Tlalpan and Coyoacán and clubs of every stripe in Insurgentes, Polanco, Condesa and the Zona Rosa.\n\nAlso, when going out, check the date, since this is an important indicator of how full places will generally be and how long you might have to wait to get in. Salaries are usually paid twice per month: the 30th\/31st-1st and the 14th-15th. On or soon after these dates is when most Mexicans will go out, especially if payday coincides with a weekend. In the more expensive places, people might leave for Acapulco or vacations farther afield during the summer and long weekends. Mexican weekends, in the sense of when it is common to go out drinking, are Thursday night to Sunday morning and sometimes throughout Sunday.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\n\n\n\nThe origins of Mexico City date back to 1325, when the Aztec capital city of Tenochtitlan was founded and later destroyed in 1521 by Spanish conqueror Hernan Cortes. The city served as the capital of the Vice-royalty of New Spain until the outbreak of the Independence War in 1810. The city became the capital of the Mexican Empire in 1821 and of the Mexican Republic in 1823 after the abdication of Agustin de Iturbide. During the Mexico-US war in 1847, the city was invaded by the American army. In 1864 the French invaded Mexico and the emperor Ferdinand Maximilian of Habsburg ruled the country from the Castillo de Chapultepec and ordered to build Avenue of the Empress (today's Paseo de la Reforma promenade).\n\nPorfirio Díaz assumed power in 1876 and left an outstanding mark in the city with many European styled buildings such as the Palacio de Bellas Artes and the Palacio Postal. Diaz was overthrown in 1910 with the Mexican Revolution and this marked a radical change in the city's architecture. The 20th century saw the uncontrolled growth of the City beyond the Centro Historico with the influx of thousands of immigrants from the rest of the country. In 1968, the city was host to the Olympic Games, which saw the construction of the Azteca Stadium, the Palacio de los Deportes, the Olympic Stadium and other sports facilities. In 1985 the city suffered an 8.1 Magnitude earthquake. Between 10,000 and 40,000 people were killed. 412 buildings collapsed and another 3,124 buildings were seriously damaged in the city.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Economy"]},"\n\nMexico City ranks 8th in terms of GDP size among 30 world cities. More than a third of the total Mexican economy is concentrated here. The size of its economy is US $315 billion, that's compared to $1.1 trillion for New York City and $575 billion for Chicago. Mexico City is the wealthiest city in all of Latin America, with a GDP per capita of $25,258.  Mexico City's poverty rate is also the lowest in all of Mexico, however, it should be noted that Mexico itself is only about the 65th richest country in the world out of 184 countries. Mexico City's Human Development Index (2009-MHDI) is the highest in Mexico at 0.9327. It is home to the Mexican Stock Exchange. Most of the large local and multinational corporations are headquartered here, mainly in the Polanco and Santa Fe districts.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh = 21"],["febhigh = 23"],["marhigh = 26"],["aprhigh = 27"],["mayhigh = 26"],["junhigh = 25"],["julhigh = 23"],["aughigh = 23"],["sephigh = 23"],["octhigh = 22"],["novhigh = 22"],["dechigh = 21"],["janlow = 6"],["feblow = 7"],["marlow = 9"],["aprlow = 11"],["maylow = 12"],["junlow = 12"],["jullow = 12"],["auglow = 12"],["seplow = 12"],["octlow = 10"],["novlow = 8"],["declow = 7"],["janprecip = 8"],["febprecip = 6"],["marprecip = 10"],["aprprecip = 23"],["mayprecip = 57"],["junprecip = 135"],["julprecip = 161"],["augprecip = 153"],["sepprecip = 128"],["octprecip = 54"],["novprecip = 13"],["decprecip = 7"],["description ="]]},"\nMexico City weather is divided in two seasons,  dry season, from November to April, and the rainy season from May to October.

Due to the extremely rapid pace of urbanization in the twentieth century little consideration was given to environmental planning. By 1987, air quality had deteriorated so much that one day thousands of birds appeared dead on the sidewalks of the city. Environmentalists attributed this to air pollution. This shocking event encouraged authorities to implement measures to improve air quality. Most heavy industries (glass, car and steel factories) and oil refineries were relocated outside of the city and unleaded vehicle fuels were introduced.\n\nToday, the air quality is in much better. Ozone and carbon dioxide levels are falling. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Although the smog layer is visible nearly every day, its effects in terms of breathing and eye irritation are barely noticeable and it should not be cause for concern for visitors."]}," Pollution is in maximum effect in the hot, dry season of spring, from late February to early May and there is a greenhouse effect that appears during winter from late November to early February.

This government body established an index denominated IMECA (Metropolitan Index for Air Quality) in order to make the population aware of the current air pollution situation.\n\nWhen the index exceeds 170 points, an \"Environmental pre-contingency\" is issued and people are asked to refrain from performing open-air activities such as sports. In the case of an \"Environmental Contingency,\" only vehicles with a zero or double zero emissions sticker can circulate.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Earthquakes"]},"\n\nThe catastrophic earthquake of 8.1 magnitude on the Richter scale, that took place in the morning of September 19, 1985, killing 9,000 to 30,000 people, remains fresh in the memory of the majority of Mexico City's inhabitants.  Since the city was established in the dry bed of lake Texcoco and several geological faults that originate in the Pacific coast reach the city, earthquakes are a common phenomenon. Right after the 1985 earthquake, many constructions were reinforced and new buildings are designed to meet structural criteria by law and no major building collapse has happened since, even after several strong earthquakes. You can check the latest earthquake activity at the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ssn.unam.mx\/ National Earthquake Center"]}," an institute of the National University (UNAM). Should you happen to be in the middle of an earthquake, remain calm and follow some simple rules: if you are indoors, stay under the doorways, move away from objects that can fall, and\/or follow exit paths (\"Rutas de Evacuación\") out to the streets; if you are outdoors, move away from slopes or electrical wires towards open areas or marked \"safe zones.\"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["People"]},"\n\nWith a population of more than 20 million in the greater metropolitan area, you can expect to find all kinds of people in Mexico City, in terms of racial, sexual, political, cultural and wealth diversity. Citizens are mostly Mestizo (people of mixed European and Amerindian racial background) and white. Amerindian people constitute less than one percent of the city's population, but there are some who are still moving to the city in search of opportunities. As elsewhere in Latin America, socioeconomic status tends to be highly correlated with ethnicity in Mexico City: by and large, the upper and middle classes have more European ancestry than the poor and the lower middle classes.\n\nThe city, as the rest of the country, has a very unequal distribution of wealth that can be characterized geographically, generally speaking, as follows: the middle and upper classes tend to live in the west of the city (concentrated in the delegaciones of Benito Juarez, Miguel Hidalgo, Coyoacan, Tlalpan, Cuajimalpa and Alvaro Obregon). The east of the city, most notably Iztapalapa (the most populous delegacion) is much poorer. The same applies to municipalities of greater Mexico City (Ciudad Nezahualcóyotl, Chalco, Chimalhuacán). Although there are pockets of poverty everywhere (and often side by side with the shiny-glitzy condos of the nouveau riche, like in Santa Fe in Cuajimalpa), it is easily noticeable that as one travels east the buildings begin to look more shabby and the people look increasingly browner—a testimony to Mexico's heritage of racial and socioeconomic inequality.\n\nSince it is a big city, it is the home of large foreign communities, like Cubans, Spaniards, Americans, Japanese, Chilean, Lebanese, and more recently Argentines and Koreans. Mexico City has a number of ethnic districts with restaurants and shops that cater to groups such as Chinese and Lebanese Mexicans.\n\nIt is the temporary home to many expats too, working here for the many multinational companies operating in Mexico. Foreigners of virtually any ethnic background may not get a second look if they dress conservatively and attempt to speak Spanish.\n\nMexico City is one of the most liberal cities in Latin America, and was the first jurisdiction in the region to legalize same-sex marriage (in December 2009). As such, this is generally a gay friendly city, particularly in the Zona Rosa District. Abortion on demand is also legal, as well as euthanasia and prostitution (the latter allowed only in designated districts).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Costs"]},"\n\nAlthough Mexico City is considered an expensive city, your trip budget will depend on your lifestyle and way of traveling, as you can find cheap and expensive prices for almost everything. Public transportation is very cheap and there are many affordable places to eat. On the other hand you can find world-class hotels and fancy restaurants with higher prices. A daily backpacker budget for transportation and meals should range between 100 to 200 pesos a day (10 to 20 USD), using public transport and eating at street stands, while a more comfortable budget should range between 200 to 500 pesos a day (20 to 50 USD) using private taxis (taxi de sitio) and eating at decent sit-down restaurants. For those with more expendable cash, you can find plenty of outlets for your dollars, euros, pounds, yen...etc.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Addresses"]},"\n\nThe addressing system is fairly simple has the street name, house number, colonia (neighborhood), city, state and postal code. Many are confused by the fact that the house number comes after the street name, unlike in the US and many other countries where the number precedes the street.\n\nIn Mexico City the street and neighborhoods have been named after an important person or a specific place like ",{"type":"''","value":["Porfirio Díaz Street and Santa Martha de Axtlahuacan Colonia"]},". A typical address could be something like this: Colima 15, Colonia Roma Norte, Mexico, Distrito Federal, 06760. However, the numbering tends to not be in the right order.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Photography"]},"\n\nFor the avid photographer, there are a few pointers to keep in mind. The city is paranoid about tripods. You are not allowed to use a tripod in any ticketed place, such as museums, the metro stations, architectural ruins, etc. You will be politely asked to hold your camera in your hands. Apparently, it has something to do with being a professional.\n\nAlthough some compact flash cards can be found at several different locations, don't expect to find exactly what you are looking for.  Look for stores such as Radio Shack, Office Depot, Office Max, Best Buy or Wal-Mart.  Prices tend to be on the high end, but they are still affordable.  You could also try some of the places that are dedicated to selling photographic equipment, they are easily identified because you will see the street signs for well known brand names. It is not unusual, however, for high-end camera retailers to offer few if any accessories.\n\nYou can print your photos at most of the major chains of pharmacies around town, look for Farmacias Benavides, Farmacias Guadalajara or Farmacias del Ahorro (with a white 'A' inside a red circle).  Prices differ from store to store. Also, while near the Zocalo on the street Republica de Brasil, many people standing on the side of the sidewalk will verbally advertise \"imprentas.\" They are offering stationery printing services, not photographic printing.\n\nFor people who love to do street photography, a good place to start is in front of the Bellas Artes square, during afternoons. There is a smörgåsbord of faces cutting across the square and perching on one of the benches for an hour will easily give you access to photography fodder. Many urchins and ethnic street dwellers have learned to ask for money before allowing you to shoot them. Sympathize and accept it as it is worth it.\n\nKeep in mind that some museums, like the Museum of National History in the Chapultepec, charge an extra fee for those with video cameras. Also in most museums, flash photography is not permitted.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Benito Juarez International Airport"]},"\n: ",{"type":"''","value":["Main article: ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Benito Juárez International Airport"]]}]},"\n\nMost travelers arrive to Mexico City by air, to Benito Juárez International Airport, located in the eastern part of the city.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Licenciado Adolfo López Mateos International Airport"]},"\n\nThis airport (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["TLC"]]},") is in the City of Toluca 50 km southwest of Mexico City and recently transformed itself from a general aviation airport into the hub of several domestic low-cost carriers such as Interjet and Volaris which serve destinations as Monterrey, Cancún, Guadalajara, Tijuana, and many other Mexican cities.

You'll quickly see how busy it is, particularly during the day: trains are often filled to significantly over capacity, and sometimes it will be hot and uncomfortable. Despite the close quarters, it's relatively quick and efficient, especially as an alternative to taxis during rush hours when the streets are essentially parking lots, and affordable (tickets for one trip with unlimited transfers within the system cost 5 pesos). Trains run every couple of minutes, so if you just miss it, you won't have long to wait until another arrives, and the Metro can be the quickest way to travel longer distances within the city. Stations usually have food stalls inside and outside the entrances, and many have city-sponsored exhibits and artwork on display, so it's good even for a look around. Operating hours are from 5AM to midnight on weekdays (starts at 6AM on Saturday and 7AM on Sunday), so if your plans will keep you out beyond midnight, be sure to have alternate means of transport.\n\nAlthough the Metro lacks informational signs in English, the system was originally designed with illiteracy in mind, so finding your way around should not be a problem. Lines are defined by number but also by a color, and that color runs as a thematic band across the entire station and along the entire route, so you always know what line you are on. Stations are identified by name but also by a pictorial icon that represents that area in some way. However, even with this user-friendly approach, entire maps of the Metro system are not posted everywhere that you'd like. They're usually only near ticket booths; there are no maps on the trains and only one or two are posted per platform, so work out your route before going through the turnstiles, and have a Metro map on you.  Trains and platforms do have a line diagram with icons and transfer points for easy reference.\n\nSome lines run through more tourist-related spots than others and will become very familiar to you after a while. Line 1 (pink) runs through many tourist spots, such as Centro Historico (Salto del Agua and Isabel la Catolica stations), the Chapultepec Forest (Chapultepec Station), Condesa and Roma neighborhoods (Insurgentes and Sevilla stations) and the Northwest Bus Station (Observatorio station). Line 2 (blue) runs through the Centro Historico (Allende, Zocalo and Bellas Artes stations) and reaches the South Bus Station (Tasqueña). Line 7 (orange) runs through many touristic spots such as the Chapultepec Forest (Auditorio Station) and the Polanco neighborhood (Polanco Station). Line 9 (brown) runs near the Condesa neighborhood (Chilpancingo). Line 3 (green) runs near Coyoacan (Coyoacan and Miguel Angel de Quevedo stations) and also near the City University (Copilco and Ciudad Universitaria stations). If traveling to and from the airport, you'll use Line 5 (yellow) to connect to the Mexico City International Airport (Terminal Aerea station, not Hangares nor Boulevard Puerto Areo of line 1). Line 6 (red) runs east-west to the north of the city and runs next to the Basílica de Guadalupe.\n\nHere are a few of the commonly-used Metro signs translated into English:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"''","value":["Taquilla"]}," - Ticket booth"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"''","value":["Entrada"]}," - Entrance"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"''","value":["Salida"]}," - Exit"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"''","value":["No Pase"]}," - Do not enter"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"''","value":["Andenes"]}," - Train platforms "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"''","value":["Correspondencia"]}," - Line transfer"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"''","value":["Dirección"]}," - Direction you are heading inside a line: one of the two terminal stations. Each platform has a large sign indicating which direction that train heads. For example, if you are travelling on Line 1 from Insurgentes to Pino Suárez stations, you are heading in the direction of the Pantitlán terminus (\"Dirección Pantitlán\"). On your return trip, you would be heading in the direction of the Observatorio terminus (\"Dirección Observatorio\")."]},"\nAs you enter a Metro station, look for the ticket booth. There might be a short queue for tickets, and to avoid having to always stand in line, many people buy a small handful of tickets at a time. A sign is posted by the ticket window that shows how much it would cost for any number of tickets. Once you approach the agent, simply drop some money into the tray and announce (in Spanish) how many tickets you would like (\"",{"type":"''","value":["uno"]},"\" for MX$5, \"",{"type":"''","value":["cinco"]},"\" for MX$25, \"",{"type":"''","value":["diez"]},"\" for MX$50, and so on). You do not need to say anything about where you are going, since fares are the same for everywhere in the system.\n\nOnce you have your ticket (",{"type":"''","value":["boleto"]},") it is time to go through the turnstiles (but make sure to confirm your route on a map first!). The stiles are clearly marked for exit or entry but if you are confused, simply follow the crowd.  Insert the ticket into the slot (it does not matter which direction is up or forward) and a small display will flash, indicating you may proceed.  You won't get the ticket back.  A few frequent Metro users use keycards instead of tickets, so if you see any turnstiles marked with \"",{"type":"''","value":["solo tarjeta"]},"\" that means the ticket reader is broken; just move to another turnstile.\n\nInstead of buying individual tickets, you may opt for a multi-use rechargeable smart card.  At the same window you buy tickets, ask for a ",{"type":"''","value":["tarjeta"]},".  There may be a minimum amount for your initial balance.  To use the card, simply hold the card next to the white card reader at any turnstile.  The cost of a single fare will be deducted and the remaining balance will show on the card reader display.  You can ask for a recharge (",{"type":"''","value":["recargar"]},") at any ticket window to supplement your card's balance.\n\nPast the turnstiles, signs that tell you where to go depending on your direction within the Line are usually clearly marked, as are signs that tell you where to transfer to a different Line. There is no standard station layout, but they are all designed to facilitate vast amounts of human traffic, so following the crowd works well, as long you double check the signs to make sure the crowd is taking you in the same direction.\n\nOn the platform, try to stand near the edge. During rush hours when it can get pretty crowded, there is sometimes a mad rush on and off the train.  Although for the most part people are respectful and usually let departing passengers off first, train doors are always threatening to close and that means you need to be moderately aggressive if you don't want to get left behind. If you're traveling in a group, this could mean having to travel separately.  At the ends of the platform, the train is usually less crowded, so you could wait there, but during rush hours some busier stations reserve those sections of platform exclusively for women and children for their safety.\n\nWhile on the train, you will see a steady stream of people walking through the carriages announcing their wares for sale.  Act as if you are used to them (that is, ignore them, unless they need to pass you).  Most often you'll see the city's blind population make their living by selling pirate music CD's, blaring their songs through amplifiers carried in a backpack.  There are people who \"perform\" (such as singing, or repeatedly somersaulting shirtless onto a pile of broken glass) and expect a donation.  There are also people who hand out candy or snacks between stops, and if you eat it or keep it you are expected to pay for it; if you don't want it, they'll take it back before the next stop.  It can be quite amusing, or sad at times, but don't laugh or be disrespectful... this is how they make a living. The best thing to do is observing how others around you behave, but you can usually just avoid eye contact with these merchants and they will leave you alone.\n\nIf the merchants weren't enough, the trains are usually just crowded places to be.  You will usually not get seats if you are traveling through the city center during the day, and even if you do, it's considered good manners to offer your seat to the aged, pregnant or disabled, as all cars have clearly marked handicap seats. In keeping with the mad rush on and off the train, people will move toward the exits before the train stops, so let them through and feel free to do the same when you need to (a \"",{"type":"''","value":["con permiso"]},"\" helps, but body language speaks the loudest here).\n\nA few words of warning: there have been incidences of pickpocketing. Keep your belongings close to you; if you have bags, close them and keep them in sight. As long as you are alert and careful you won't have any problems. Women have complained of being groped on extremely crowded trains; this is not a problem on designated women's wagons, or any other time than rush hour. If theft or any other sort of harassment do occur, you can stop the train and attract the attention of the authorities by pulling on alarms near the doors, which are labeled \"",{"type":"''","value":["señal de alarma"]},".\"\n\nWhen exiting, follow the crowd through signs marked ",{"type":"''","value":["Salida"]},".  Many stations have multiple exits to different streets (or different sides of streets, marked with a cardinal direction) and should have posted road maps that show the immediate area with icons for banks, restaurants, parks and so forth.  Use these to orient yourself and figure out where you need to go. A good tip is to remember what side of the tracks you are on, these are marked in such maps with a straight line the color of the metro line you are traveling.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nThere are two kinds of buses. The first, are full-sized buses operated by the City Government known as ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.rtp.gob.mx\/ RTP"]}," and cost $2 anywhere you go. Make sure to pay with exact change as they don't give change back. The second kind of buses are known as \"Microbuses\" or \"Peseros\". These buses are private-run and come in small and bigger sizes, all rather ominous looking. Peseros cost 4 pesos for shorter trips, 4.50 pesos for 6–12 km trips and 5 pesos for 12+ km trips. Full-sized private buses are 5 pesos for shorter trips, and 6 pesos for longer trips.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:MexicoCityMicrobus.JPG"],["thumb"],["Mexico City Microbus"]]},"\n\nBoth type of buses usually stop at the same places, which are totally random and unmarked stops just before intersections. Routes are also very complex and flexible, so be sure to ask someone, perhaps the driver, if the bus even goes to your destination, before getting on. Also, though the locals hang off the sides and out the doors, it is generally not recommended for novices. Riding RTP buses is probably a safer and more comfortable way than the private franchised and smaller microbuses who are known to have terrible driving habits. All buses display signs on their windshields which tell major stops they make, so if you want to take a bus to a metro station, you can just wait for a bus that has a sign with an M followed by the station name.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Turibus Ciudad de Mexico.jpg"],["thumb"],["Turibus"]]},"\n\nBuses can be packed during rush hours, and you have to pay attention to your stops (buses make very short stops if there's just one person getting off, so be ready), but they are very practical when your route aligns with a large avenue. There's usually a button above or close to the rear door to signal that you're getting off; if there isn't one, it's not working, or you can't get to it, shouting ",{"type":"''","value":["Bajan!"]}," (pronounced \"BAH-han\") in a loud and desperate voice usually works.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Metrobús"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Metrobús - Cidade do México, DF.jpg"],["thumb"],["Mexico City Metrobus"]]},"\n\nEstablished in June 2005, the Metrobús is a BRT system that operates four routes (líneas) in dedicated lanes along Insurgentes, Vallejo, Cuauhtémoc and Eje 4 Sur Avenues. A fifth route is being constructed as of 2013. It costs 6 pesos to ride, but a refillable fare card must be bought in advance (16 pesos, including one fare) at vending machines. There are stops approximately every 500m. Expect it to be crowded around the clock, but its a great way to get up and down these major thoroughfares very rapidly. Since there are branches in each route, you must check the bus' billboard before boarding to see which is the last stop they will visit, for some don't go from end to end of the line. There are reserved boarding areas (indicated on the platforms) for women, the handicapped and the elderly.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By trolley bus"]},"\n\n\"Trolebuses\" ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ste.df.gob.mx\/servicios\/lineas.html"]}," are operated by the Electric Transport Services. There are 15 Trolley bus lines that spread around for more than 400 km. They usually do not get as crowded as regular buses, and they are quite comfortable and reliable. They can be a little slower than regular buses, since they are unable to change lanes as quickly. There is a flat fare of 4 pesos, and bus drivers do not give out change.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By light rail"]},"\n\nThe ",{"type":"''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ste.df.gob.mx\/servicios\/trenligero.html Tren Ligero"]}]}," is operated by Electric Transport Services and consists of one single line that runs south of the city, connecting with Metro station Tasqueña (Line 2, blue; alternatively you may see it spelled as ",{"type":"''","value":["Taxqueña"]},"). For tourists, it is useful if you plan to visit Xochimilco or the Azteca stadium.  The rate for a single ride is 3 pesos, and while the ticketing system works very similarly to the Metro, the tickets are not the same. You must purchase light rail tickets separately; they are sold at most stations along the line.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nThere are more than 250,000 registered cabs in the city and they are one of the most efficient ways to get around. The prices are low, a fixed fee of about 6 pesos to get into the cab, and about 0.7 pesos per quarter kilometer or 45 seconds thereafter, for the normal taxis (taxi libre). The night rates, supposedly between 11PM at night and 6AM in the morning are about 20% higher. Some taxis \"adjust\" their meters to run more quickly, but in general, cab fare is cheap, and it's usually easy to find a taxi. At night, and in areas where there are few taxis, cab drivers will often not use the meter, but rather quote you a price before you get in. This price will often be high, however, you can haggle. They will tell you that their price is good because they are \"safe\". If you don't agree on the price, don't worry as another cab will come along.\n\nAlthough safety has in recent years substantially improved, catching cabs in the street may be dangerous. Taxi robberies, so-called \"express kidnappings\", where the victim is robbed and then taken on a trip to various ATMs to max out their credit cards, do sometimes occur, but there are some general precautions that will minimize the risk:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Taxis have special license plates.

Always include either the name of the ",{"type":"''","value":["colonia"]}," or the district (i.e. \"Zona Rosa\"), as well as any nearby landmarks or cross streets.  You will probably be asked to give directions throughout or at least near the tail end of the journey; if either your Spanish or your sense of direction is poor, carry a map and be prepared to point.\n\nThe two most common recommendations for a safe cab riding experience are to make sure you take an official cab, and to notify a person you trust of the license plate number of the cab you are riding. There is a free app available for iPhone, android and Blackberry (soon) that allows you to verify if a cab is official by comparing the taxi license plate number with the government provided data and that lets you communicate through Facebook, twitter and\/or email the license plate number of the cab you have taken or even communicte an emergency through these mediums.

Traffic jams are almost omnipresent on weekdays, and driving from one end of the city to the other could take you between 2 to 4 hours at peak times. The condition of pavement in freeways such as Viaducto and Periferico is good, however in avenues, streets and roads varies from fair to poor since most streets have fissures, bumps and holes. Most are paved with asphalt and only until recently some have been paved using concrete. Since the city grew without planned control, the street structure resembles a labyrinth in many areas. Also, traffic 'laws' are complex and rarely followed, so driving should be left to only the most adventurous and\/or foolhardy. Driving can turn into a really challenging experience if you don't know precisely well where are you going.

It is possible to park in other streets without meters but is likely there will be a \"parking vendor\" (Franelero in Spanish) which are not authorized by the city, but will \"take care of your car\".

Most of these offer very good food, are usually safe, and should range between $35 to $60.\n\nPerhaps the most ubiquitous type of food almost anywhere in Mexico city are fast food outlets, located on the ground floor  of a street-facing building, or ",{"type":"''","value":["puestas"]},", street stands located on a sidewalk or almost anywhere there is room. These serve the usual tacos, burritos or ",{"type":"''","value":["tortas"]}," (filled bread rolls similar to a sub or sandwich), and they can be very cheap ($10 to $50). The ",{"type":"'''","value":["Taquería Aguayo"]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mexico City\/Coyoacán"],["Coyoacán"]]}," is a superb example.\n\nIf you want to stuff your face with lots of real Mexican food at cheap prices then head over to La Merced (the central market, located on the pink line of the subway at the stop \"Merced\"). There are several restaurants as well as stands serving up some delicious food. Huaraches, which are something like giant tortillas with different toppings\/fillings, are popular here, as are alambres.\n\nAnother superb market is located a stone's throw from the Salto del Agua metro stop; ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mercado San Juan Arcos de Belem"]},".

The people running it are amazingly welcoming and the food, especially the Cubana, is excellent.\n\nIf you want something safe and boring, most American fast food chains have franchises here.  You'll see McDonald's, Burger King, KFC, Pizza Hut, Domino's Pizza, TGI Friday's, Chili's, Dairy Queen, Subway, and yes, even Starbucks. These are all fairly affordable to Europeans\/Americans and people from other richer countries but generally cost more than they do in the US, and aren't delicious.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["El Globo"]},", a French-style bakery, has locations throughout the city selling both French and traditional Mexican pastries, like orejas (little ears), éclairs, empanadas, and rosca during New Year's. It can't be beat for a quick snack or bagful of pastries to eat later.\n\nDo not miss the chance to go to ",{"type":"'''","value":["Panaderia Madrid"]}," (calle 5 de Febrero, one block south off the main plaza in downtown Mexico). This is a very old and typical bakery, they will usually have fresh bread twice a day, but if there are a lot of customers they will bake as many as four times a day.\n\nAsian food restaurants are abundant, and the quality is good, and caters from cheap Chinese cafeterias to expensive and very good Japanese food. Note that Korean, Japanese and Chinese are most common cuisines in Mexico City, while Indian, Thai and Indonesian can be harder to find. Most sushi places, however, put far too much rice on their sushi rolls and not enough fish.\n\nVegetarian (",{"type":"''","value":["vegetariano"]}," in Spanish) alternatives are commonly available at larger restaurants, but don't expect much from street vendors. The magic phrases, for vegetarians or vegans, are \"sin pollo\" (no chicken), \"sin carne\" (no meat), \"sin huevo\" (no eggs) and \"sin queso\" (no cheese). If you can communicate this and then gesticulate to the menu, the waiter normally will give you suggestions. In regular restaurants, they will even try to edit an existing dish for you.

Cantinas serve a wide range of Mexican and foreign drinks, with prices usually reasonable compared to prices in the US, and you'll be continually served various Mexican food, such as tacos (you should ask for 'Botana'). If your tolerance for Mexican music (mariachi or otherwise), smoke-filled rooms, and lots of noise is low however, this may not be your kind of place. Cantinas are open moderately late, usually past midnight at the very least. However some cantinas, like La Victoria, near the Plaza Garibaldi, are also open at midday for lunch.\n\nIn Mexico City you have an almost endless choice of options to party. Traveling by yourself at night in Mexico City is not a good idea, especially in Plaza Garibaldi where pickpocketers are ever ready to relieve you of your unguarded cash. One of the ways you can check out the night life safely is by doing a ",{"type":"'''","value":["Night Club Tour"]},". These tours will typically take you to a few clubs and include transportation. Mexicans are for the most part very friendly and enjoy socializing.\n\nIn addition, there are bars that play a combination of Spanish and English-language rock, electronic music, and some Latin\/Caribbean music. These bars tend to close around 3-4AM.\n\nClub music mainly falls into three main categories, pop, rock and electronic music. The pop places generally play what's on the music charts, Latin pop, and sometimes traditional Mexican music, and are frequented by a younger (sometimes very young) audience, and are often more upper class. The rock places play rock in the wide sense, in English and Spanish. Most people are at least over 18 in these places. The electronica clubs, which attract everyone from Mexico City's large subculture of ravers and electronica fans, of all ages. Most clubs close late, 3-4AM at the earliest, and some are open until 7AM or 8AM.\n\nThe best bet used to be the Zona Rosa, which has a large number of street bars with rock bands playing and a large selection of clubs, especially strip clubs and gay bars. South of Zona Rosa you can find the Condesa area, with many options of bars and restaurants. Another good area is Polanco, particularly a street called Mazaryk, where you'll find plenty of good clubs but it is best to make a reservation, Bollé club is one posh club on that street . Be forewarned - entrance is judged on appearance and to get a table a minimum 2 bottle service is required, unless its a slow night [min. US$80 per bottle]. Posh and upper scale night clubs can be found in the Lomas area, particularly the Hyde, Shine, Sense and Disco Lomas Clubs, but be warned some of these could be extremely expensive, where the cover charge could range from 250 pesos upwards and bottles start at 130 USD. In addition, getting in could very difficult, as these are the most exclusive in town. There are also exclusive gay friendly clubs in that area with the same characteristics Envy night club on palmas 500 and Made nightclub on chapultepec next the lake and the restaurant El Lago chapultepec.\n\nThe other common Mexican-style thing to do when going out is to go dancing, usually to salsa, meringue, rumba, mambo, son, or other Caribbean\/Latin music. This is considerably more fun if you're a somewhat competent dancer, but even complete beginners who don't mind making fools of themselves will likely enjoy it. Most dance places close late, 3-4AM is common.\n\nThe legal drinking age is 18. It is illegal to consume alcohol in public (\"open container\").  This is strictly enforced and the penalty is at least 24 hours in jail.\n\nTake an identification card such as a copy of your passport.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Embassy Suites Hotel by Hilton Mexico City Reforma.jpg"],["thumb"],["200px"],["Embassy Suites hotel facing Cristobal Colon statue in Reforma."]]},"\n\nThe city has literally hundreds of hotels in all price ranges, though the district you want to stay in will be a good indicator of price and quality.

If you want to make a long distance call out of Mexico, you should dial the prefix 01 for national calls followed by the area code. If you are making an international long distance call, you must dial 00 followed by the country code, for example, if you're calling the U.S. you should dial 00+1 and the area code, if you're calling the U.K, dial 00+44 and the area code, and so on.\n\nIf you want to use your cellular phone you can get your phone unlocked before you go. When you arrive in Mexico City, you can purchase a Télcel or Movistar SIM card, locally known as a \"chip\". This will get you a Mexican Cell phone number. Remember this is a prepaid cellular option. You get free incoming calls from inside the city, but the roaming charges can easily build up if you travel to other cities. People calling you from long distance will need to dial in this format: +52 (55) plus 8 or 7 digit phone number. Mexico city, Guadalajara and Monterrey have 8 digit numbers, and 2 digit area codes.  The rest of the country has 7 digit numbers and 3 digit area codes.\n\nCalling from a Mexican phone (either land or mobile) to a Mexican cell phone is called ¨El Que Llama Paga¨ meaning only the person making the call pays for the air time, and thus requires to dial the 044 prefix before the 10 digit number composed of the area code and the mobile number to be dialed: land or mobile to Mexico City registered mobile would be 044 55 12345678. If you are calling to a mobile with a different area code, i.e. Acapulco area code 744 then you use the prefix 045, then the three digit area code, the seven digit mobile i.e. 045 744 1234567. This might seem confusing at first but you get easily accustomed to it.\n\nAnother option is to buy a prepaid Mexican phone kit, they frequently include more air time worth than the kit actually costs, air time is called ¨Tiempo Aire¨. For Telcel these kits are called ¨Amigo Kit¨ for Movistar they are called ¨Movistar Prepago¨ and for Iusacell ¨Viva Kit¨ the you can just keep the phone as a spare for whenever you are in Mexico; there are no costs in between uses. These kits start at around 30 USD and can be purchased at the thousands of mobile phone dealerships, or at OXXO convinence stores, and even supermarkets.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Mobile Telephones"]},"\n\nThere are four main cell phone operators in Mexico. \n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Telcel"]}," The largest coverage in Mexico, now using 3.5G, 3G and GSM (HSPA+, HSDPA & EDGE) Will Have 4G (LTE) by 2012"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Movistar"]}," A GSM & 3G (HSDPA) network with decent coverage in most of the country"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Iusacell (includes former Unefon network)"]}," A CDMA (EVDO) and GSM-based 3G (HSDPA) and 3.5G (HSPA+) network with an average coverage in most cities and large towns.

Price varies from 10 to 20 pesos an hour.\n\nLook for the word 'Cyber' or 'CiberCafe' in order to find a place with internet access.\n\nHot spots for wi fi connection to the internet are available in several places around the city, particularly in malls, coffee stores and restaurants. Most (if not all) of them are operated by the Mexican phone company Telmex through their Internet division Prodigy Movil. In order to be able to connect in those places,  the user must be subscribed to the service, or buy a prepaid card known as \"Tarjeta Multifon\"; visitors coming from the US can access the service using their AT&T or T-Mobile Internet accounts.

Areas around the historic center are generally well-lit and patrolled in the early evening. Much of your travel within the city will be done via public transportation or walking. Mexico City is an immensely crowded place, and with any major metropolitan area, it is advised to be aware of your surroundings.\n\nTaxi robberies, so-called \"express kidnappings\", where the victim is robbed and then taken on a trip to various ATMs to max out their credit cards, do occur, although safety in the city has improved in recent years. 95% of total kidnapping victims are nationals, so your odds of being taken are very slim, they are not targeting strangers, yet you should always use your common sense.\n\nThe two most common recommendations for a safe cab riding experience are to make sure you take an official cab, and to notify a person you trust of the license plate number of the cab you are riding. There is a free app available for iPhone, Android, and Blackberry (soon) that allows you to verify if a cab is official by comparing the taxi license plate number with the government provided data and that lets you communicate through Facebook, Twitter and\/or email the license plate number of the cab you have taken or even communicate an emergency through these mediums. The free service is called ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.taxiaviso.com Taxiaviso"]},"\n\nProtect your personal information. There are pickpockets in Mexico City. Purses and bulky, full pockets are quite attractive. Do not keep your passports, money, identification, and other important items hanging out for someone to steal. Place items in a hotel safe, or tuck them away inside your clothes. The Metro or Subway system can get extremely crowded, which creates opportunities for pickpockets on cars that are often standing room only.\n\nDo not show money in front of others as this generally attracts pickpockets.\n\nDo not leave anything of value inside your car, always use the trunk, even things that could be considered to hold something of value (for example, an empty gift box) will attract unwanted attention to your car and might prompt a broken window.\n\nPlan ahead, and know where you are going and how you will arrive. Mexico City is quite hospitable, and people who work for hotels and other hospitality-oriented businesses will help. This will help in avoiding confusion, becoming lost or stranded. Also, you can ask a local for advice to get somewhere, though you should speak good Spanish to do this. In the Polanco, Sante Fe and Lomas districts, some police officers and many business people and younger children speak English, as it is very common to learn it in school.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Police officers"]},"\n\nPolice officers in Mexico get paid a third of what ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New York City"]]}," police officers make, and some rely on bribes and corruption to make more money (however, never offer a bribe first since usually an officer will at least go through the formality of assessing a fine). The historic center and other major sites often have specially trained tourist police that are more helpful than ordinary transit cops.\n\nThe Mexico City Government recently opened a specialized prosecution office (Ministerio Público in Spanish) for foreigners that find themselves affected by robberies or other crime situations. It is in Victoria Street 76, Centro Historico. Multilingual staff are available.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["In case of emergency"]},"\n\nDial 066, the number for all emergencies, (fire, police and medical).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n\nSome people may consider Mexico City to have a bad reputation, in terms of crime statistics, air pollution, and on more contrived issues, such as earthquakes.  However, crime and pollution levels are down over the last decade and you shouldn't face any trouble within the tourist areas.  As in any large city, there are areas that are better to be avoided, especially at night, and precautions to take, but Mexico City is not particularly dangerous.\n\nWhen walking in the city you could be approached by people.  Usually they are just trying to sell something or begging for a few coins, but if you aren't interested, it is not considered insulting to just ignore them.  Also, if someone of importance (such as a police officer) approaches you, they will definitely let you know.\n\nIf you do get approached by a police officer, understand that there are three different types: the ",{"type":"''","value":["Policia"]}," (Police), who are usually driving around the city with their lights flashing; the ",{"type":"''","value":["Policia Auxiliar"]}," (Blue uniform)(Auxiliary Police), who are like security guards; and the ",{"type":"''","value":["Policia de Transito"]}," (Bright Yellow hat and vest) (Traffic Police) who simply direct traffic.\n\nIf you are cruising around town and don't want to look like a tourist, avoid wearing shorts. It gets hot here, but it is remarkable how few locals in the capital city wear shorts. Some churches won't even let you walk inside if you are wearing shorts.\n\nRemember most Mexicans are very curious in regards to foreigners and are willing to help. If in need for directions, try to ask young people, who may speak a little English.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Driving"]},"\n\nMany locals (not all of them, of course) have very aggressive driving habits as a result of the frequent traffic jams in the city. Some traffic signals are more an ornament than what they were made for, such as Stop signs, although most people respect traffic lights and pedestrian ways. When traffic is not present, particularly at night, locals tend to speed up so be careful when changing lanes. Street names and road signs may not be present everywhere so it is strongly advisable to ask for directions before driving your car.  Sometimes potholes, fissures, and large-yet-unanticipated speed-bumps (\"topes\") are common on the roads, so exercise some caution. Even at a small crawl, these can damage a car, especially in the backroads between towns in the Southern area. It should be avised that when driving, a fast succession of white lines cutting the road perpendicular means a 'tope' is approaching and you should slow down immediately. When off the main roads, especially in the ",{"type":"''","value":["colonias"]},", maneuvering in the narrow streets and alleys can be tricky. Often a paved road turns to cobblestone (in high-end neighborhoods) or dirt (if this happens, you've gone way off the tourist areas). Also, some ",{"type":"''","value":["colonia"]}," streets are blocked off behind gates.\n\nIf you are driving through a housing development, you should beware of children, as they often run on the pavement as if they were in their backyard.\n\nYou should also be mindful of people on bicycles and motorcycles alike, because they tend to drive in the narrow spaces between cars.  The best thing to do is to yield to them.\n\nTrolleys have the right of way on their assigned lane, since they cannot switch lanes as easily.\n\nThose who are used to having a berm or paved area to the side of the road will quickly notice that the berm is missing on many roads and freeways such as Viaducto and Periferico. If you go off the side of the road, there will be a four to six inch drop off of the pavement. Driving in Mexico City should be avoided if at all possible. It should also be noted that in high density areas such as Centro Historico, Mexico City, there is no street parking available during business hours.\n\nEven the best of plans can go wrong when you arrive at your proposed exit at 65 mph, and there is a detour onto some other road with no markings or road signs, with everyone going as fast as they can go. At that point you may want to exit immediately and regroup before you end up miles from where you planned to exit. Maps and road signs likely will be lacking any usable information in a situation like this and your best bet may be to navigate by the seat of your pants a parallel route to the one you found closed.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Drinking"]},"\n\nIn many nightclubs, bars and restaurants it is common for minors to drink without proving their age as long as they appear to be over 18. It is also permitted for minors to drink alcohol if they are in the company of an adult who is willing to take responsibility. Drinking alcoholic beverages in the street is prohibited—doing so can get you in trouble with the police. Drunk driving is also strictly prohibited and strongly punished, though it seems highly common in any case. The police have incorporated random alcohol tests on streets near bars and clubs, and if you test positive, you could be arrested and spend 36 hours in jail. The system is very efficient, and you will sometimes see a stopped car or truck with a policeman interrogating the occupants.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Smoking"]},"\n\nSmoking inside public and private buildings is strictly prohibited by law. Restaurants used to have smoking and non-smoking sections, but recent laws have banned smoking in any public enclosed space. Fines can be steep, so if you want to smoke in a restaurant it is best to ask the waiter before lighting up. Of course, going outside is always an option. Smoking light drugs, such as marijuana, is prohibited and offenders could be imprisoned if found in possession of more than one personal dose.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Embassies"]},"\n\nMexico City is home to a large number of embassies.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["Canada"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Canada"],["url=http:\/\/www.canadainternational.gc.ca\/mexico-mexique\/index.aspx"],["email=mxico@international.gc.ca"],["address=Schiller 529, Col.
