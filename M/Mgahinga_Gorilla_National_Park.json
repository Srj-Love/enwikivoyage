Boda-bodas and high-clearance four-wheel drives are perhaps the only vehicles that can reliably pass even during the dry season.  A boda-boda from Kisoro into either park entrance (Muhavura or the main entrance) will cost around UGX15,000 as of June 2014 and will take about an hour.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nVolcano hiking: Mount Sabinyo, Mount Gahinga, and Mount Muhavura (Muhabura) can all be climbed in the park. Guide and guard are mandatory but included in the price, though tipping appears to be customary. Each climb takes approximately 6-8 hours, depending on personal fitness level and trail conditions. Prices as of January 2014 were $60, though this may vary according to how the trek was booked. \"Wellington boots\" (rubber boots) can be rented for about UGX10,000 (USD4 in January 2014) and porters for c. USD15. Note also that the start point for Muhavura is at a different park entrance than that of Sabinyo and Gahinga.\n\nGorilla Tracking: Mountain gorillas can be tracked in the park. Prices are steep for foreign non-residents but cheaper than in neighbouring Rwanda.\n\nGolden Monkey Tracking: Golden monkeys are a species of monkey essentially unique to the Virunga mountains.  Substantially cheaper than mountain gorilla tracking.    \n\nBirding:\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Amajambere Iwacu Community Camp"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.amajamberecamp.org"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=At the Mgahinga Gorilla National Park's main entrance"],["phone=+256 774 954 956"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["price="],["content=The only budget place right at the entrance (other option being Volcanoes Safaris at $200) brings money back to the community by offering cute bandas & camping, all in view of three of the Virungas.
