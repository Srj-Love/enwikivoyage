Recent developments have made the bus system more reliable than in the past. Even with the changes, and because of high local traffic, buses tend to have a hard time remaining on schedule. However, buses run often enough through each route so as not to be a nuisance. Many of the major bus routes operate 24 hours a day, seven days week, including the Route S bus, which connects downtown Miami to all of Miami Beach, terminating at Avenutra Mall in north Miami-Dade.\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Metrorail"]}," is a single-line elevated rail system serving Miami and surrounding cities, running 22.4 mi with 22 stations.

Coconut Grove and downtown ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Coral Gables"]]}," can be reached via short shuttle bus from various stations. Metrorail operates between roughly 5AM and midnight, with a bus serving all Metrorail stations operating in the overnight hours, effectively providing 24-hour service.\n\nRecently, state and federal funding has allowed for planned expansions to the Metrorail to take better shape. A connection to Miami International Airport started construction in late 2009, and is expected to be fully operational by Spring 2012. Along with this project, a northern expansion dubbed the 'Orange Line'  was given more than $4.3 billion in funding in the 2009 Federal \"Stimulus Package\" and is expected to be opened as early as 2014. This new line will connect the Metrorail line with Dolphins Stadium, Miami-Dade College, and the suburbs of Miami Gardens and Opa-locka. There have also been discussions among elected leaders for a light rail line to Miami Beach, as well as a Miami Streetcar connecting Downtown Miami to the Media and Entertainment District in Midtown Miami, though no formal plans have been proposed or approved for funding.\n\nFare for a single trip on both Metrorail and Metrobus is $2 per ride ($1 for persons with disabilities or on Medicare). Day, weekly, and monthly pass are available. In early 2010, Miami-Dade Transit implemented a fare card system known as EASY Card. Though exact change\/cash is still accepted on all Metrobus routes, an EASY Card is required for riding the Metrorail, and for utilizing the free transfers offered between an unlimited number of bus routes, and a single Metrorail ride. Currently, the fare card software does not allow passbacks. Any remaining transit tokens you may have can no longer be exchanged for EASY Card credit, and are not accepted as fare.

Almost all cab companies in the area have pre-determined rates for travel into the barrier islands of Miami Beach and other beach and nightclub communities popular with tourists which can range from $30–$60 depending on arrival location. For example, South Beach may be the most expensive while a residential neighborhood in Miami Beach may be the cheapest. The charge is the same regardless of pick-up location on the mainland. All taxis are fitted with maps of the barrier islands which state the cost per location. The same applies for passengers leaving the islands onto the mainland, though normal rates apply for person traveling by taxi within the islands or within the mainland.\n\nService is available throughout Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, and Monroe counties regardless of pick-up location. The normal service charges apply for these four counties, but it is wise to ask for a pre-determined price beforehand if leaving the county as this will in most cases turn out to be cheaper and most drivers are willing to negotiate when leaving the county. If you wish to be taxied to a location outside of those four counties, you must negotiate a price and advise the cab company first. Drivers may refuse to drive outside of the metropolitan area if they are not advised to do so beforehand.\n\nUsually you will have to call a cab company and request a pick-up.

For all intents and purposes, taxis can be flagged from the street on the island in a very similar way to what one might expect in New York City.

If you enter a cab and do not see a valid license placed in front of the passenger's seat, you should not enter the taxi and instead call another cab company regardless of what the driver says. If you willingly enter a taxi without a license or with an expired license and there is an incident or accident, it is possible that you may not be able to hold the driver accountable by law. When entering a cab you should make note of the driver's name, license number and cab number if any problems arise during the trip. This information should be easily found inside the taxi.It may be able to help you identify the cab driver to the police or the cab company.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By car "]},"\n\nUnless you plan to stay downtown or in a single location elsewhere, you will find that a car is very convenient in Miami, and car rentals are cheap in comparison to other major US cities.\n\nYou can find cheap car rentals off terminal from the Miami Airport from such companies as ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.e-zrentacar.com\/Locations\/Miami-Airport\/ E-Z Rent-A-Car"]}," and Ace Rent A Car. The major car rental companies can be found in terminal be can be often more expensive for the same service and vehicles.\n\nSurface roads in Miami are usually easy to navigate. The area's roads are designed around a grid system, where most roads are numbered based on their distance from the city center. The two main axis roads are Miami Avenue (running north to south) and Flagler Street (running east to west). These two roads intersect in downtown Miami, the county's symbolic center. All avenues run north to south, while all streets run east to west.  For example, the address, \"9500 NW 30th Street\" would be at the intersection of NW 30th Street (to the west of Miami Avenue, and 30 blocks north of Flagler Street) and NW 95th Avenue (north of Flagler Street, and 95 blocks west of Miami Avenue). Most roads in Miami conform to this nomenclature, but due to the more than 30 municipalities within Miami-Dade County, there are a few exceptions to be aware of. Examples include Coral Gables, the Coconut Grove section of Miami (city proper), Miami Lakes, and Hialeah.  Hialeah is particularly notorious since it uses its own grid system, in addition to the overall county system. For example, NW 103rd Street is also marked as E 49th Street, or W 49th Street in Hialeah.\n\nNote that if you cross into Broward County, the roads will be numbered based on their distance from the Fort Lauderdale city center, which is generally the same going east-west but will be very different going north-south. Most of the municipalities in Broward County use their own limited grid systems as well.  Some street names also change at the county line. The coastline highway, A1A, is known as \"Collins Avenue\" in Miami, but becomes \"Ocean Drive\" in Broward. Likewise, \"Red Road\" in Miami becomes \"Flamingo Road\" in Broward.\n\nMiami has four primary expressways. In addition to I-95 and Florida’s Turnpike, there is state highway ",{"type":"'''","value":["836"]}," (also known as the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Dolphin Expressway"]},") and state highway ",{"type":"'''","value":["826"]}," (also known as the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Palmetto Expressway"]},"). The Dolphin Expressway runs west from downtown Miami along the edge of Miami International Airport. The Palmetto Expressway and Florida's Turnpike form \"F\"-shaped loops around the city. The Turnpike continues north, roughly parallel to I-95, and will take you to Orlando if you keep driving. I-95, the Palmetto and the Turnpike intersect at a junction in North Miami called the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Golden Glades"]},". You may find driving in the Glades challenging, especially if you have little experience driving in it.\n\nNew visitors to Miami should be aware that the area's drivers are particularly aggressive.

This shouldn't discourage anyone from using the roadways, but a passive approach to Miami driving can save you from an unwanted exchange with another driver, or even worse an accident. Posted speed limits are ignored by most drivers, especially on larger roads with lower speed limits. Two examples are I-95 and state road 826 (The Palmetto Expressway). The eastern portion of state road 836 (The Dolphin Expressway) between Miami International Airport and downtown Miami handles traffic that exceeds its capacity, and contains several left-hand exits, including the eastbound off-ramp to Lejuene Road (NW 42nd Avenue), which is the posted route, and the quickest route to Miami International Airport.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By Shuttle "]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.supershuttle.com\/en\/MIAAirportShuttleMiami.html Super Shuttle"]}]},". +1 305 871-8210 or email sales@miamisupershuttle.com.

Created in the 1990s, the cuisine alternatively known as New World, Nuevo Latino or Florribean cuisine blends local produce, Latin American and Caribbean culinary tradition and the technical skills required in European cooking. Nuevo Latino is said to be the brainchild of four chefs: Allen Susser, Norman Van Aken, Mark Militello and Douglas Rodriguez. All of them still work in Miami and most of them work at the restaurants they created in the 1990s. New World is not restricted to these chefs’ menus. This cuisine influences several restaurants around the city to this day.\n\nMiami may be known for its Latin cuisine, especially its Cuban cuisine but also cuisines from South American countries such as Colombia, but there are other different kinds of restaurants to be found around the city. In addition to stand-alone restaurants offering up various cuisines from Chinese and Japanese and Middle Eastern and Italian (among other cuisines), there are cafés, steakhouses and restaurants operating from boutique hotels as well as chain restaurants such as TGI Fridays and Ben & Jerry’s.\n\nMiami is known for having nightclubs double as restaurants throughout the city. Most of these restaurants, such as Tantra (which had one of their chefs recently appear on ",{"type":"''","value":["Top Chef: Miami"]},"), BED and the Pearl Restaurant and Champagne Lounge (attached to Nikki Beach), are located throughout South Beach. However, some of these restaurants\/nightclubs like Grass Lounge can be found in the Design District (north of downtown but south of North Miami).\n\nIf many of Miami’s premiere restaurants don’t fit into your daily budget, consider eating during Miami Restaurant Month (better known as ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.miamirestaurantmonth.com\/ Miami Spice"]},") in August and September. This year at 80 select restaurants, lunch costs $22 and dinner is $35.\n\nMiami’s dining scene reflects burgeoning diversity, mixing exotic newcomer restaurants with long-standing institutions, often seasoned by Latin influence and hot winds of the Caribbean. New World cuisine, a culinary counterpart to accompany Miami’s New World Symphony, provides a loose fusion of Latin, Asian, and Caribbean flavors utilizing fresh, area-grown ingredients. Innovative restaurateurs and chefs similarly reel in patrons with Floribbean-flavored seafood fare, while keeping true to down-home Florida favorites.\n\nDon't be fooled by the plethora of super lean model types you're likely to see posing throughout Miami. Contrary to popular belief, dining in this city is as much a sport as the in-line skating on Ocean Drive. With over 6,000 restaurants to choose from, dining out in Miami has become a passionate pastime for locals and visitors alike. Its star chefs have fused Californian-Asian with Caribbean and Latin elements to create a world-class flavor all its own: Floribbean. Think mango chutney splashed over fresh swordfish or a spicy sushi sauce served alongside Peruvian ceviche.\n\nWhatever you're craving, Miami's got it—with the exception of decent Chinese food and a New York-style slice of pizza. If you're craving a scene with your steak, then South Beach is the place to be. Like many cities in Europe and Latin America, it is fashionable to dine late in South Beach, preferably after 9PM, sometimes as late as midnight. Service on South Beach is notoriously slow and arrogant, but it comes with the turf (of course, it is possible to find restaurants that defy the notoriety and actually pride themselves on friendly service). On the mainland—especially in Coral Gables, and, more recently, downtown and on Brickell Avenue—you can also experience fine, creative dining without the pretense.\n\nThere are several Peruvian restaurants at SW 88th Street and SW 137th Avenue in Kendale Lakes. Take the 88 or 288 buses from Dadeland North train station. This is kind of out of the way, but it is worth it.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["movetodistrict"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=La Carreta"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/lacarreta.com\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 305 444-7501"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=SW 8th St, – Open 24hrs a day.

Most hotel bars and independent bars turn the other cheek at your physical appearance, but you have to dress to impress (which does ",{"type":"''","value":["not"]}," mean dress like a stripper) to get into a nightclub. Also remember to never, under any circumstances, insult the doormen and\/or nightclub employees that will grant you entry or touch the velvet ropes or you may as well be sitting on the opposite side of the clamoring masses trying to get in. Attempting to tip the doormen and claiming that you know employees that work in the nightclubs (unless you actually called and reserved a table or a spot on the VIP list) is also considered an affront. Getting to the club unfashionably early and pushing through the crowd (and not the doormen) also can help make you stand out in the crowd. Finally, most nightclubs won’t admit groups of men unless those men are waiting in front of a gay bar. Bring some women or leave the pack if you’re desperate to get in. And once you get in, remember that the charge to get in these clubs can cost up to $20—cash only (some clubs, however, mercifully have ATMs—that can charge up to $7 for a withdrawal). Popular drinks in Miami include the Cuba Libre and the mojito.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Sleep "]},"\n\n\n\nMiami is known for its boutique hotels (especially those in South Beach). Designers such as Ian Schrager (the Delano, Shore Club), André Balazs (Raleigh, Standard on Belle Isle) and Todd Oldham (the Hotel) helped put South Beach on the map with their creative hotel designs. The downside of many of the boutique hotels is that rooms can be small, particularly if the building was built during the height of the Art Deco period in Miami. If you value space, a boutique hotel may not be the type of hotel for you. If you don't need to stay in a boutique hotel (and value space), Miami has several upscale high-rise hotels north and south of South Beach, as well as near the downtown area. Miami does have its share of less costly chain hotels for those who value space and\/or money.\n\nThe high season for hotels is around Nov to Apr because of the lower temperatures. However, Miami's lower temperatures, in comparison to the majority of the United States around this time, are still warm. High season is also marked by the advent of many Miami events, such as the Winter Music Conference and Spring Break. If you wish to reserve a room during Miami’s high season, especially at a boutique hotel and\/or a hotel on South Beach, you should book months in advance.\n\nBe aware that hotels have a 12.5% room tax and some hotels may add a 15% service charge which may or may not be added if you reserve a room through the hotel, through a travel agent\/agency (either in person or using an online site such as or similar to Expedia, Orbitz and Travelocity) or through an opaque (prices are given, but the name and location of the hotel is unknown) travel site such as Priceline or Hotwire.\n\nSome hotels offer garage and\/or valet parking; check with your hotel about parking before booking a room if you wish to drive around Miami.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\nThe major area codes for Miami-Dade County are 305 and 786.
