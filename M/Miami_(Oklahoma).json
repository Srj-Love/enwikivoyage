Founded 1913 after lead and zinc deposits were discovered on leased Quapaw land, Pitcher was once a city of 15000 which produced the lead for bullets for two world wars. Mining ended in 1957; population declined 80-90% in the following decade. 14,000 abandoned mine shafts, 70 million tons of mine tailings, and 36 million tons of mill sand and sludge were left behind, undermining 85% of the city's buildings and contaminating potable water supplies with lead. A 2006 state-sponsored buyout and permanent evacuation were already well underway when, on May 10, 2008, an EF4 tornado killed eight people and cut a mile-wide swath through town. The tornado-damaged structures were never rebuilt. The 1000 maps, 500 photos and various artefacts from the Picher Mining Field Museum (N Connell Ave, in the 1926 Tri-State Zinc and Lead Ore Producers Association office) were moved to the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Baxter Springs"]]}," Historical Society Museum in 2008. The city's archives were turned over to the Northeastern Oklahoma A&M College in Miami in 2010 as part of the process of shutting down municipal government; the town disappeared from maps in 2012-2013.\n\nAs of 2014, Gary Linderman's Old Miner's Pharmacy was the last operating business and six residents remained. While most of the buildings have been demolished, a few still stand - often as ruins. An abandoned christian church, a ruined pool hall, the empty miners museum, an auction house, a building where mining equipment was sold and a small collection of homes are all slowly deteriorating.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=I-44.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["directionl1=W"],["image1a=Will Rogers Turnpike.svg"],["imagesize1a=22"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tulsa"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vinita"]]}],["directionr1=E"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Springfield (Missouri)"],["Springfield"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Joplin"]]}],["image2=US 66 (historic).svg"],["imagesize2=22"],["directionl2=W"],["majorl2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tulsa"]]}],["minorl2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vinita"]]}],["directionr2=E"],["majorr2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Joplin"]]}],["minorr2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Baxter Springs"]]}],["image3=US 69.svg"],["imagesize3=22"],["directionl3=S"],["majorl3=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Muskogee"]]}],["minorl3=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vinita"]]}],["directionr3=N"],["majorr3=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kansas City"]]}],["minorr3=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Overland Park"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["36.883611"],["-94.876111"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Green Country (Oklahoma)"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Miami,_Oklahoma"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North_America\/United_States\/Oklahoma\/Localities\/M\/Miami\/"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Miami, Oklahoma"]]}]
