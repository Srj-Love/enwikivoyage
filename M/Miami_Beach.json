However, English is the language of preference, particularly when dealing with businesses and government. Spanglish, a mixture of English and Spanish, is a somewhat common occurrence, with bilingual locals switching between English and Spanish mid-sentence. The local Latin population is mostly Cuban exiles (which have now become second and third generation locals,) with South Americans from various countries gaining ground. There is also a large ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Haiti"],["Haitian"]]}," community and many signs and public announcements are in English, Spanish and Creole.\n\nMiami Beach has been one of America's pre-eminent beach resorts for almost a century.

Notable additions to the biking and pedestrian infrastructure include the paved \"Beach Walk\" which runs parallel to Ocean Drive and Collins Avenue and is directly on the beach, plus the new South Point Park along the bay. In Miami Beach and South Beach riding is permitted on sidewalks, which luckily are wider than average.   That said, it doesn't stop many people from trying to utilize bicycles (including locals) to get around town.  Pedestrians and drivers tend to be tolerant of bikers and willing to share the right of way. However, be prepared to slow down and go on foot, particularly on the congested streets closer to the beach. Absent heavy auto traffic, South Beach is biking bliss.\n\nThere are better attempts at bike-friendliness in the South Beach district, where most of the bike rental shops are located. Lummus Park and Lincoln Road Mall are great for bikers, and have plenty of bike racks throughout; meanwhile, if you are trying to go north or south, go a few blocks west and take one of the roads less traveled. Meridian Ave is a good choice: plenty of interesting Miami-style houses to see and a local park. If you didn't bring your own bike, bike rentals will run about $8\/hour or $30\/day (or 24-hour time period).\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["City of Miami Beach \"DecoBike\" Official Bike Rental & Sharing Program"]},", 723 Washington Ave., +1 305 532 9494 ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.decobike.com"]},".
