Accordingly, individual states and especially cities have strong individual identities and locals are more likely to identify with a major subregion like the New York City tri-state area, the D.C. metropolitan area, rural Pennsylvania, Downstate New Jersey, etc., than to identify with the Mid-Atlantic as a whole.\n\nBecause of the Mid-Atlantic region's significance and large urban centers that draw not only upon the regional populations, but across the nation as well, there is a higher population density (see the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mid-Atlantic#Get around"],["Get around"]]}," section).

These metro areas consist of immense urban sprawl radiating out from the city centers, covering a significant fraction of the region's land area.  Their huge populations ensure that the roads remain congested, beaches well attended, and paths well-beaten.\n\nThis is a real East Coast region, with all the associated stereotypes of huge immigrant communities from all over the world, leftist politics aplenty, good food, and a vaguely arrogant (and ignorant) attitude towards the rest of the country.

Fortunately it is seeing low-cost competition from a peculiar set of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Chinatown bus"]}," routes. These no frills point A to point B services arose organically from the needs of Chinese-Americans to visit their relatives in the various Chinatowns across the region. The service caught on when the general public realized they could travel round trip from D.C. to New York for $30. There is no central internet site for these services, so you are best off doing a general internet search. Be aware that the Chinatown buses do occasionally terminate and originate in unsavory urban neighborhoods. \n\nA new wave in intercity coach transportation is large corporations trying to emulate Chinatown buses but with better services. ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.megabus.com Megabus"]}," was the first to embrace the new business model, offering heavily discounted fares from its New York hub to Boston, Toronto, Buffalo, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Atlantic City and Washington.

The high-speed Acela express runs frequently along the Washington-Philadelphia-New York-Boston corridor. Amtrak also serves upstate NY, and western PA. Unfortunately, Amtrak is a very expensive option, often more so even than flying or renting a car! \n\nIn addition to frequent Amtrak service, there are a number of much cheaper regional (commuter) rail lines including: ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.mta.info\/mnr\/ MTA Metro North"]}," and ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.mta.info\/lirr\/ Long Island Railroad"]}," around ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New York City"]]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.njtransit.com\/ NJ Transit"]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Jersey"]]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.shorelineeast.com\/ Shore Line"]}," (for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Connecticut"]]},"), SEPTA for the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Philadelphia"]]}," area (also connecting to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wilmington (Delaware)"],["Wilmington"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Newark (Delaware)"],["Newark"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Delaware"]]},"), and MARC for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Maryland"]]}," (especially the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Baltimore"]]},"-",{"type":"[[","value":[["Washington, D.C."]]}," corridor). \n\nIt is possible to travel much of the coast using only regional rail, and although it will probably be slower than the Amtrak or Acela Express, it will also cost a fraction of the price, and may take you through towns you might not otherwise see. Making the trip from New York City to D.C. is relatively straightforward, with only one rail gap between Philadelphia and Baltimore: take New Jersey Transit from Penn Station to Trenton Amtrak Station, connect to SEPTA R7 Regional Rail to Philly's 30th Street Station, get from Philly to Baltimore by other means (Greyhound bus or car rental being the most simple way), then connect to the Marc Train at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Baltimore"]]},"'s Penn Station to D.C.'s Union Station. Note, though, that Amtrak leverages its political power to monopolize the rail lines to an extent on weekends, shutting down the popular Marc Train.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By thumb"]},"\n\nAll states in this region maintain convenient service plazas along the major highways, which are probably your best bet for hitchhiking as the freeway itself is closed to pedestrians.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nWhen in Rome, do as the Romans do; drive in the USA. Driving is the only practical way to tour the Mid-Atlantic, if you intend to visit anything beyond the major cities. That said, the Mid-Atlantic is the least pleasant place to drive in the entire country. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Traffic"]},", both inter-city and intra-city, can be horrendous—the D.C. area regularly tops the lists of the nation's most congested cities, and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Metro New York"]]}," is never far behind.

Aggressive and often puzzling driving is commonplace along the interstates and in more populous areas.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["I-95"]}," is the coastal super highway, at times encompassing a whopping eighteen lanes, and connects D.C. to New York through Baltimore, Philadelphia (optional), and pretty much everything in between in New Jersey and Delaware. It is the fastest way to drive between these cities, but it is unpleasant and ridden with expensive tolls (especially in Delaware!) and very bad traffic on weekends and around local rush hours. Avoiding I-95 requires a bit of creativity and slightly longer trips through Pennsylvania west of Philadelphia, but such trips can be rewarding in terms of scenery, no tolls, little traffic, and just easier traveling generally.\n\nUpstate New York and rural Pennsylvania can be home to unmaintained roads, so be wary of where the GPS is taking you. In Upstate New York and Pennsylvania as well, snowfall is not always dealt with immediately. Many regions will not plow secondary roads unless several inches of snow fall. Driving can be treacherous in winter storm conditions, so it is best to avoid it all together.\n\nFinally, a direct warning is in order: Driving into D.C. and New York is really not advisable. Doable, certainly; fun, not likely. Washington D.C.'s street layout was designed to ",{"type":"'''","value":["confuse invading armies"]},". New York is extremely congested, and its drivers are the ",{"type":"'''","value":["most aggressive"]}," in all of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North America"]]}," (though ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boston"]]},"ians may dispute that claim). Philadelphia is also filled with extremely reckless and fast-drivers, but at least the city is laid out in a grid.  If you are driving into D.C., get good directions and don't do it anywhere around rush hour. If driving into New York, save yourself by parking in a less congested borough (like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Queens"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brooklyn"]]},"), where you might actually find free on-street parking, and take a subway line from there into ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Manhattan"]]},". Driving in Mid-Atlantic cities is really not recommended however because it is not necessary; Mid-Atlantic cities have the best mass transit systems in North America. It is almost always better to take a train in and use mass transit than to drive in and pay astronomical parking expenses.\n\nBy contrast, navigating urban traffic in the more off-the-beaten-path areas of the Mid-Atlantic, such as Upstate New York, can be a breeze: the populations of many cities such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Buffalo"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rochester (New York)"],["Rochester"]]}," have shrunk considerably since the 1950s, when their highway systems were constructed. This means that roads are uncongested the vast majority of the time—it's even relatively easy going at rush hour.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nAlthough there are lots of budget flight options between cities on the Mid-Atlantic, due to the hassles and delays associated with increased security precautions, especially in the New York City area, short flights are usually best avoided. All major cities are connected by regional and commuter rail options with stations in the central business districts of these destinations. Moreover, most inter-city planes travel between suburban airports fairly far out from the city center.
