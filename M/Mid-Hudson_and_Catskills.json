Benedict Arnold made his getaway down the river after his plan to sell out the fort to the British was exposed.\n\nAfter the war ended with American independence, the new nation found in the river and its surrounding valley its earliest cultural inspiration. Washington Irving lived on the river's banks and wrote his most famous story, ",{"type":"''","value":["Rip Van Winkle"]},", about the Dutch inhabitants of the upper valley. Thomas Cole, Frederick Church and other painters of the Hudson River School found inspiration in the landscapes of the Highlands and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Catskills"]]},".

The Erie Canal was opened between Albany and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Buffalo, New York"],["Buffalo"]]}," in 1825, and a quarter-century later the first railroads along the river were in place.\n\nSoon the cities of the valley industrialized, and those who had become rich from that development, like the Vanderbilts and Jay Gould, moved into their own riverfront mansions. At the southern end of the valley the country towns of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Westchester County"],["Westchester"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rockland County"],["Rockland"]]}," counties gradually became commuter suburbs, growing explosively after World War II. That growth came with a price, however, as the pollution from the industrialization taxed the river's ability to cleanse itself, making it almost an open sewer. \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Storm King from across Hudson.jpg"],["right"],["thumb"],["Storm King Mountain"]]},"\nBut the region responded by helping to launch the modern American environmental movement. A power plant project that would have carved a dam out of Storm King Mountain south of Cornwall and strung transmission lines across the river was halted in 1965, when the Scenic Hudson Preservation Committee persuaded a federal court to allow consideration of the aesthetic impact the project would have on the landscape, a landmark ruling. Other environmental groups, such as Clearwater and Hudson Riverkeeper, were launched to protect the river itself, aided greatly by the passage of the Clean Water Act in the 1970s.\n\nThe upper stretches of the river still have signs warning against eating fish caught there due to the polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) remaining in the riverbed. Most came from a former General Electric plant in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hudson Falls"]]},", and remediation efforts have long been a political sore point in the region.\n\nAlong with the river, the region suffered from the decline of manufacturing jobs in late 20th-century America. Cities like Newburgh, Peekskill and Poughkeepsie became poorer as jobs left, compounded by ill-advised urban renewal projects such as Poughkeepsie's Main Mall Row. Many who stayed wondered if the region had seen its best days.\n\nThe depressed regional housing market, however, created opportunities. Manhattan- and Brooklynites looking for that urban vibe at a cheaper price began buying up the old houses and restoring them. The state's Hudson River Greenway helped communities like Peekskill and Newburgh clean up and revitalize their riverfronts. Outside the valley's cities, some old farms became subdivisions, occupied by the middle-class families who found themselves priced out of closer suburbs. Today exurbanization reaches into Dutchess and Orange counties, and is slowly creeping into Greene and Columbia counties at the north end, where the metropolitan area centers on Albany. In between, the valley remains a mixture of old and new.\n\nCommunity after community along the river continues to revive its waterfront. Visitors from New York City come to their shops on the weekend and sometimes decide to settle in towns like Cold Spring, Beacon, Saugerties, and Hudson, where they restore old houses and take in the fantastic scenery.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nThe valley is generally cooler than New York City, both in summer and winter. In the former season this effect is positive, as it blunts any heat waves that hit the city (temperatures have broken 100¬∞F (38¬∞C) on occasion, but not by much). In the winter this means, however, that storms are likely to be more severe (when TV weather forecasters from the city say something like \"north and west, this will all be snow\", they're usually pointing at the lower or central Hudson Valley).\n\nThese effects are more pronounced as one gets further from the river and higher into the mountainous and hilly terrain, like the Catskills or Taconics, on either side. The Catskills and Shawangunks can also create \"rain shadows\" near their bases on some days, due to the prevailing winds blowing from the west across them. At the same time they also tend to buffer the region from some of the storm systems that come down from Canada to menace the rest of upstate New York in early winter.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Traffic going through flooded at Muddy Kill on NY 17K after Hurricane Irene, Montgomery, NY.jpg"],["thumb"],["Flooding after Hurricane Irene, 2011"]]},"\nThe most serious weather events are thus usually the nor'easters that follow the coasts. The wind that sometimes comes along with them regardless of season can sometimes be strong enough to blow down trees or branches and cause widespread power failures. In recent years some tropical cyclones have severely affected the region.
