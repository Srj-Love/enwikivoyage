It stretches from the fringes of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Snowdonia"]]}," in the north to the edge of industrial South Wales, and from the English border to the Irish Sea.\n\nMuch of the region consists of the remote upland area of the Cambrian Mountains.  They are not high by UK or international standards - the highest point is Pumlumon Fawr, at 752 metres or 2,467 feet.  But they are wild and remote, with only a few small villages and isolated farms, and crossed by only a handful of roads; the land is largely useful only for sheep-farming and forestry.  Several of the valleys were also flooded in the 1950s and 1960s to create reservoirs mainly serving England, which proved controversial at the time.  The mountains also act as a barrier between the more English-speaking county of Powys in the east and the predominantly Welsh-speaking county of Ceredigion to the West. The areas towards the English border and are lower-lying, more fertile and more heavily populated, particularly in the valleys of the rivers Severn, Wye and Usk, all of which rise in the mountains.  While the scenery of mid Wales may not match the rugged grandeur of Snowdonia, it has an appeal of its own: softer and greener, yet much emptier and less given over to tourism.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nAs elsewhere in Wales, English is universally understood.
