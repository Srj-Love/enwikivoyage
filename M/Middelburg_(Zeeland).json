In colonial times, this was one of the most important cities in the country, and still today Middelburg is packed with monuments reminding of those golden times. A good part of the centre is still surrounded by the old, star shaped canal ring. Lined with boats and cycleways, this part of town is both attractive and typically Dutch. The centre is dominated by a large square, still regularly used as a market square and overlooked by the beautifully ornamented former town hall. Around there, you'll find a mostly pedestrianised shopping area.\n\nSlightly further out from the centre is the shipping canal connecting Veerse Meer to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vlissingen"]]},".

The massive complex has a more or less round shape with a pretty square in the middle. It has 3 churches, 5 towers and a number of gates. The tallest abbey tower is called ",{"type":"'''","value":["Lange Jan"]}," ",{"type":"''","value":["Long John"]},", and is the most famous landmark in the Middelburg skyline. It's accessible for visitors and offers a great view over town.  After the 2 year siege of Middelburg in 1572-1574, the abbey life was ended by force and the buildings were used for local and regional government.
