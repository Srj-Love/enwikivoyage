Arabs, Persians, Turks and Jewish people are the largest groups, but there are several substantial minorities — Kurds, Armenians and others — with their own languages, customs and sometimes their own countries. Every invading army — from Alexander and the Romans through Genghis Khan to the 19th century colonial powers — has left descendants behind. There are also substantial numbers of workers from other countries coming to the region for higher pay — mainly Afghan, Pakistani for jobs like construction labourer, with Egyptians, Filipinos, more Pakistanis, and some westerners in the more skilled jobs.   \n\nEvery country in the Middle East has a Muslim majority (with the notable exception of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Israel"]]}," which has a Jewish majority), with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Iran"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Iraq"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bahrain"]]}," mainly Shia, other areas mainly Sunni, and both with minorities of the other — and the legal systems in most of these countries are influenced by Islamic Law; a few are entirely based  on it.\n\nMiddle Eastern politics is controversial, incredibly complex, often violent and rapidly changeable. Indeed, it is not usually advisable for tourists to engage in political discussion with strangers. The Middle East is one of the most important geopolitical regions in the world. The world's largest oil reserves, conflicts that date back to the dawn of civilization and religious tensions can make the Middle East seem dangerous.
