Since then, Midland has served as a center for agriculture, ranching, and transportation for the southern plains.  \n\nMidland was a relatively small town until the discovery of oil in the 1920s, when it was quickly transformed into the administrative hub of the Permian Basin. One of the world's largest petroleum-producing regions, today the basin supplies nearly 20 percent of the country's oil and gas output, and thousands of people are employed locally to extract it.  \n\nNowhere is the oil influence more visible than downtown, where the streets are lined by high-rise office buildings constructed by oil companies. The Bank of America Building is reputably the tallest building between Fort Worth and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Phoenix"]]},", and the Wilco Building is only a little shorter.  The Petroleum Building is a beautiful example of architecture from the roaring twenties, while Claydesta Center (a business park of several 5 & 6 story buildings) showplaces the splendour of the heyday of Midland's Oil Business.\n\nThe oil crash in the late 1980s dealt a firm blow to the area, and Midland fell into a bit of disrepair, but has since bounced back and is chugging along.
