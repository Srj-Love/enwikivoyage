It was made famous by an Oscar-winning color documentary in 1942, and a 1976 feature film, both about the battle which marked a turning point in World War II.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Midway_Islands_satellite.jpg"],["right"],["300px"],["thumb"],["Satellite view of Midway Islands"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\nMidway is part of the extended series of Pacific islands which include ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hawaii"]]},".  It is an atoll of several low, sandy islands.  The two largest are ",{"type":"'''","value":["Sand Island"]}," (the most developed) and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Eastern Island"]}," (not to be confused with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Easter Island"]]},"), with the smaller ",{"type":"'''","value":["Spit Island"]}," between them. A coral reef which nearly encircles them (one of the most northerly coral formations of this kind).  The three largest islands total 6.2 km",{"type":"<","value":["sup",["2"]]}," in area; their collective coastline is 15km.  The highest point is 13m above sea level.  The climate is subtropical, but moderated by prevailing easterly winds.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nThe U.S. took formal possession of the islands in 1867. In 1903 President Teddy Roosevelt declared the islands a seabird conservation area. Later in 1903 the laying of a trans-Pacific telegraph cable, which passed through the islands, brought the first residents. Between 1935 and 1947, Midway was used as a refueling stop for trans-Pacific flights, and a hotel was built to house passengers.  A naval base was constructed shortly before the U.S. entered World War II, and the victory over a Japanese fleet off Midway in 1942 was one of the war's turning points. Although the islands and surrounding waters were designated a National Wildlife Refuge in 1988, they continued to serve as a naval facility until 1993.  The atoll was transferred to civilian control in 1996 following an environmental restoration effort.  The US Fish & Wildlife Service manages Midway as part of the Papahanamokuakea Marine National Monument.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nA private air charter company based in Honolulu provides air service to the Midway Islands on their 19-seat Gulfstream with a capacity of 3200-lbs. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which manages the atoll, currently has a newly established visitor program in place to accommodate small groups of interested visitors. Organizations or individuals wishing to visit Midway Atoll must apply for a permit from the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument months in advance of their intended visit. Currently a marine conservation non-profit called Oceanic Society is offering naturalist led ecotours consisting of groups limited to 16 participants. The tours are natural history focused, and offer one excursion to Eastern Island, and at least one snorkeling trip to the emergent reef. In addition to the Oceanic Society tours, Military Historical Tours (miltours.com) offers once-yearly day trips to the island on June 3rd.  Participants arrive around noon on a chartered Continental Micronesia 737-800 from Honolulu and leave around 8 that evening.  These tours include official ceremonies commemorating The Battle of Midway and also offer some time to explore the island.  There is a harbor on Sand Island, and Henderson Field Airport on Sand Island is fully FAA certified and kept operational around the clock as an emergency landing strip for many trans-Pacific flights. Without this runway being maintained many twin engine jets would have to choose alternate routes that would use much more fuel. Travelers with their own means of transportation can inquire with the FWS about visiting. However sailors must still apply for the above permits months in advance of visiting and the Monument has very strict guidelines that must be followed in order to transit through these protected waters. A few examples are that vessels must have their hull cleaned prior to entrance and owners must pay $1500 for the required monitoring devices that track vessel movements while in monument waters. These requirements are in place to try to inhibit the introduction of invasive species and make sure that the fragile coral reefs are not jeopardized by errant sailors. Cruise ships crossing the Pacific sometimes stop outside of the atoll, using tenders to deliver passengers to Sand Island for day visits ashore however even these cruise ships must adhere to the strict permitting guidelines in order to pass through and visit the protected Monuments waters. Day visitors from cruise ships are guided by US Fish and Wildelife staff on excursions to see historic memorials to the battle of Midway, the nesting areas of over 2 million albatross, as well as many other seabirds. Midway is also home to the endangered Hawaiian monk seal and Laysan teal as well as over 200 spinner dolphins and many green sea turtles.  Midway is a US Territory and a valid passport is required for entry.   \n\nFor more information about group tours visiting Midway in 2008 and 2009 see Oceanic Society's website at http:\/\/www.oceanicsociety.org\/\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nBikes and golf carts are available for rent.

As well as the original Cable buildings erected in 1903.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nThe primary activities on Midway Atoll are nature viewing, wildlife photography, snorkeling, kayaking and touring the World War II historical sites.  Although scuba diving was once available to visitors, it is now available only to researchers working on the island. Fishing is prohibited because previous \"catch and release\" practices on the shore reduced the number of Ulua at Midway. North Beach is open to humans, but other beaches are normally off limits and reserved for sea turtles and Hawaiian monk seals, both of which are endangered and protected under federal law.

A miniature golf course on Sand Island is being restored.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Work"]},"\nUS Fish & Wildlife employs about 6 staff personnel and has about 10 to 12 volunteers stay for 3 to 4 month stints throughout the year. Also USFWS has brought out a contractor to operate the facilities at Midway. This company is called Chugach and is a Native American corporation based out of Anchorage, Alaska. Currently employing about 55 persons. Most are foreign workers from Thailand, but some are US citizens hired for a variety of needs. Additionally there are 4 airport\/fireman contract workers, and one PA, these positions all periodically are advertised as open on various websites.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nSand Island has a small \"Ship Store\" that carries basic items, snack type foods, and alcohol.

Meals are served three times a day at the regular posted hours only.  The most popular food item in the Clipper House is the soft-serve ice cream machine.  Beverages and ice are available in the hotel lobby, but there are no snack machines.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nWater is a precious commodity on any island.  The water at Midway is pure and safe to drink.  Island residents carry and use refillable aluminum water bottles.  Visitors should bring their own.  Once you see the amount of plastic that washes up on the shores of the atoll you will understand why plastic bottles are shunned.  Alcohol is served in the local bar for 2-3 hours several nights per week.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nThere are no true \"hotels\" at Midway.  Old naval barracks have been refurbished as comfortable hotel rooms, each with a private bath.  During the albatross breeding season (winter) up until the time that the chicks fledge (summer) there is the constant sound of the albatross.  Ear plugs are advised.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nThere is no crime on Midway, though there is an old navy brig that can be used as a jail.  Rule breakers are put on the next plane out.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\nMidway is staffed with a Physician Assistant, and three of the airport workers are EMT trained. The medical clinic includes an emergency room, ambulance, and x-ray suite. Biggest worries are sunburn, dehydration, and twisted ankles. Venturing off the posted pathways and trails presents a very real danger due to the unstable, sandy terrain chock-full of holes created by burrowing petrels. However, the existence of an active runway (Sand Island) makes it possible to stage any medical evacuations of injured or seriously ill individuals from Midway to Honolulu.  Evacuations by air are expensive and are generally NOT covered by regular health insurance.  Visitors are advised to have travel insurance that specifically covers medical evacuations. Through a partnership with Travel Guard, Diver's Alert Network (DAN) offers such insurance at very reasonable rates.  Each insured pays the same rate regardless of age, and each individual traveler needs insurance.  For the best coverage, purchase least 15 days in advance of your travel.  DAN insures both divers and non-divers alike.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Things change frequently at Midway.
