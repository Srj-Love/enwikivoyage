There aren't many trails in the park and most secondary roads are closed during the rainy season. the hippo pool is always a good spot to see animals. If you spend two days driving in the park you should expect to see lions, elephants, giraffes, buffaloes, zebras, hippos, boars, wildebeests, impalas, and copious amounts of birds. When entering the park, ask the guards at the gate which areas are best for viewing that day and if they've seen any lions around. Also, look for circling vultures, which indicates a dead animal, there may also be some lions around snacking on the remains.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Lodging"]},"\nThere are three places to stay in the park.

This camp is almost in the center of the park and offers a great view from the top of the hill where the restaurant and pool are located. The staff is very friendly and the food is good, although not exceptional, especially given the price. At night you can hear animals walking around and under the elevated tents. The other Foxes owned lodging is ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.tanzaniasafaris.info Vuma Hills"]}]}," which is about 6km from the main gate. Very nice accommodation and excellent food, but I've never heard any animals at night, which is a cool feature of the previous spot. I've never stayed at Kikoboga, but the huts look nice and there is a watering hole near by which attracts many animals especially during the dry season.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["City of Mikumi"]},"\n\nIn the city of Mikumi are several accommodations.

(See the Tanzania main page on the recommendations for driving in developing countries.)\n\nDO NOT enter a national park without a FULL tank of petrol. You should also have an emergency jerry can with at least 20 liters of fuel and a full-sized spare tire in case you damage your tire in a remote area and need to drive through difficult terrain.\n\nOther equipment to bring includes a tow rope, shovel, machete, torch (flashlight), first aid kit and  extra drinking water for unexpected delays.\n\nAlthough it's very unlikely you will have any difficulties if you must change a flat tire in the park, be aware that lions and cheetahs are ambush hunters. Don't stray to far from the vehicle and keep the children inside at all times.\n\nTsetse flies: They are very abundant in Mikumi. They are somewhat similar to houseflies but sting. In more densely forested parts of the park, keep your windows closed. If one does get in, kill it immediately as they are quick to bite. Tsetse fly bites can potentially be harmful to humans as they are carriers of the sleeping sickness virus.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["-7.2000"],["37.1333"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Central Tanzania"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinepark"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Mikumi_National_Park"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Mikumi National Park"]]}]
