It is the second most populous city proper in the country, but sits at the centre of Italy's largest urban and metropolitan area. While not considered as beautiful as some Italian cities, having been greatly destroyed by Second World War bomb raids, the city has rebuilt itself into a thriving cosmopolitan business capital. In essence, for a tourist, what makes Milan interesting compared to other places is that the city is truly more about the lifestyle of enjoying worldly pleasures: a paradise for shopping, football, opera, and nightlife. Milan remains the marketplace for Italian fashion â€“ fashion aficionados, supermodels and international paparazzi descend upon the city twice a year for its spring and autumn fairs.\n\nMilan is famous for its wealth of historical and modern sights - the Duomo, one of the biggest and grandest ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gothic architecture"],["Gothic"]]}," cathedrals in the world, La Scala, one of the best established opera houses in the world, the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele, an ancient and glamorous arcaded shopping gallery, the Brera art gallery, with some of the finest artistic works in Europe, the Pirelli tower, a majestic example of 1960s modernist Italian architecture, the San Siro, a huge and famed stadium, or the Castello Sforzesco, a grand medieval castle.

Milan is the most modern of all Italian cities, and it still keeps most of its past history intact.\n\nAt first sight, Milan looks like a bustling and relatively stylish (with its shiny display windows and elegant shops) metropolis, with a good number of grand palaces and fine churches in the centre, but might seem like a slightly prosaic, soulless and business-orientated place. It can be quite rainy, grey and foggy, and some of the buildings, ancient or modern, have quite a severe appearance. Whilst there are a lot of parks, Milan looks as if it has very little greenery, and apart from the very well-kept historic part, many areas are indeed quite scruffy and dirty. However, Milan, unlike most usually historical European cities which throw the sights in your face, requires quite a lot of exploring - take it as it is, and you might enjoy its fashionable glitter and business-like modernity, but might find it not very \"captivating\". If you spend time, though, strolling through less well known areas such as the pretty Navigli, the chic Brera district, the lively University quarter, or some of the smaller churches and buildings, you'll find a forward thinking, diverse city filled in every corner with history, and with a plethora of hidden gems. Plus, with such an established history in theatre, music, literature, sport, art and fashion, there's really not much you can miss.\n\nMilan, as many have noticed, doesn't fully feel like a part of Italy. Despite the similarities between typical Italian cities such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Verona"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Venice"]]}," with the city, it does have a different atmosphere. Milan feels more like a bustling, busy, fashionable business capital - where in several cafes, lots of people only stop to have a quick espresso at the bar counter, and where tourists at times seem even more laid back than the locals. Milan, unlike the traditionally red-terracotta roofed Italian cities, is quite grey, as many buildings are constructed using limestone or dark stones. Ancient buildings mainly have a sort of Austrian\/Germanic neoclassical look with some slight French influences. However, with some cycling around in old fashioned bicycles, restaurant chairs and tables outside at summer filled with locals and tourists alike, and people strolling down the pedestrian avenues, licking an ice cream or carrying some heavy shopping bags, Milan does boast some \"Italian flair\".\n\nThese differences between Rome and Milan are evident from several proverbs, such as an Italian saying about the differences of the two cities which roughly translates,",{"type":"''","value":[" \"Rome is a voluptuous woman whose gifts are very apparent, while Milan is the shy, demure girl whose treasures are plentiful, but discovered in time.\""]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["When to visit"]},"\nMilan, depending on how you want to tour the city, is virtually visitable all the year. Keep in mind most places, including tourist destinations and museums, are closed on Mondays.\n\nIn autumn, the weather is warm\/cool, and in later months can be quite rainy and foggy. At this time of the year, the city's inhabitants are very busy with work, so, the only people you're likely to see wandering around are tourists. All the major venues and shops are opened, since it is the working part of the year.\n\nIn winter, the city can become cold (often below or around zero degrees Celsius [32 degrees Fahrenheit]), and the weather is usually foggy and rainy if not snowy. However, the city, in the few weeks before Christmas, becomes delightful to visit - the main sights are all illuminated by stunning lights, a huge Christmas tree is set up in front of the Duomo, vendors and markets can be found everywhere, many shop and display windows are decorated and the streets become bustling with locals and tourists alike. However, the only downside is that it can become extremely crowded, noisy and busy.\n\nIn spring, the weather is similar to that of autumn. People go back to work, and the atmosphere becomes more quiet, yet serious unlike that of the winter. Parks become nice to visit, as trees blossom. The city is also quite nice to visit at Carnival, where people dress up and celebrate, and during Easter, where there are special services held in churches and some special events.\n\nIn summer, Milan can become extremely hot and humid, with the odd powerful rainstorm here and there. Whilst in July, apart from the weather, most shops remain open, in August, as many locals go off to take their summer holidays, many businesses and venues shut down (with the notice ",{"type":"'''","value":["Chiuso per ferie"]},", or shut down for vacation). The city may become quite empty with the odd tourist strolling around, and with several of the main sights shut down. Despite it's not the best time for shopping and the weather's not at all times very pleasant, it's good if you want to enjoy the city to yourself when it's quiet, and maybe want to stroll around, sipping at the odd open bar or at an ice cream, or walking in a silent park. Despite many businesses shut down, some still do remain open, and you will still be able to find some open shops, restaurants and museums.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Alitalia Airbus A330-200 Olivati-1.jpg"],["thumbnail"],["An Airbus 330 of Alitalia taking off at Malpensa with the Alps in the background"]]},"\nMilan has two main international air gateways, ",{"type":"'''","value":["Linate"]}," airport and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Malpensa"]}," airport.

The subway network is rather extended (lines split into different sections and its 72 stations cover most areas of town). Trains run every 1â€“3 minutes.

Being above ground means you get a view of what you're passing, so if you don't need to go far, they're convenient and fun. Some tram lines are operated by the ultramodern 'jumbo' green tram, others are run by yellow or orange antique traditional carriages (similar to the ones in San Francisco) with wooden panneling inside and glass chandeliers. There is also a restaurant tram and a party tram with disco music. Many tram stops have electronic information panels with indications on how many minutes to wait before the next available service.  These are known as trams and an Italian (or non-American foreigner for that matter) will have no idea what you are talking about if you ask them where to find a 'streetcar'.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nBuses should probably be your third public transport option. Equally comfortable, rather punctual and clean with many routes to choose from. ATM streetcar and bus services stop around 2AM. However, some lines end their service earlier and some do not have a night service at all. In any case check your route and timetable in advance if you want to travel late at night. From 8PM to 2AM a special shuttle service is operated by ATM, called ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.atm-mi.it\/ATM\/Muoversi\/Radiobus Radiobus"]},", an on-call bus accessible only by pre-booking. Radiobus is a good, cheap and efficient alternative to taxi. Shuttle buses operated by ATM, with the characteristic silver color with a strip of international flag painted diagonal, operate after 8PM and until 2AM; you may book them by phone at 02 4803 4803 at least 20 minutes in advance (a couple of hours is better). The bus will stop at a dedicated place (these have an hexagonal panel with blue writing ",{"type":"'''","value":["RADIOBUS"]}," and telephone number on white) and will leave you virtually any place. Memorize the pick-up location. The driver will wait for ladies to enter the home door as a courtesy. Costs â‚¬2 per person. You may buy the tickets in advance, or pay on the bus.\n\nSeveral buses connect suburban cities and towns surrounding Milan. Some are managed by ATM. You can travel on most of them with an inter-urban ticket (biglietto interurbano) which are sold in two forms: including travel in Milan or without. In the without form you can only go to the end of the line, while with the cumulative version you can transfer to any ATM line. There are several rules and distance limits which apply, so be aware of them when you purchase your ticket.\n\nMany bus stops have electronic information panels with indications on how many minutes to wait before the next available service.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nTaxis can be expensive and drivers are allowed to pick passengers up from designated taxi ranks, through phone bookings and directly from the sidewalk of a street. The main taxi companies can be reached at 02.40.40, 02.69.69 or 02.80.80, or alternatively, from a land line dial 848.814.781 to be connected to the nearest taxi stand. If you book a taxi by phone you'll start paying from the moment the driver accepts the call and comes to pick you up. Local law define some fixed fee trips: Milan to Malpensa Airport â‚¬70, Malpensa Airport-Rho Fair â‚¬55, Malpensa Airport-Linate Airport â‚¬85, Linate Airport-Milan Fair â‚¬40. All fees are intended for a one-way, non-stop trip; taxi waiting time and booking are extras.

Suburban trains run less often than Metro trains (depending on the line, they range from 1 to 4 per hour) but, as some lines share tracks and stations, you can expect as many as 10 trains per hour in central Milan between Lancetti and Porta Vittoria stations. Suburban Railway 'S' Lines are usually marked in blue on subway maps. The Passante is not heavily used by the Milanese and in non-peak hours stations can be deserted so would not be recommended for lone (and particularly female) travellers.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nDriving is definitely not a good idea to get into the city centre.

No matter how hot the day, one will see elegantly dressed people of both sexes in timeless fashion without a drop of sweat. There are many places to sit, apart from the ubiquitous cafes, especially in the parks. Get a decent map of the city before setting out though, as the roads do not always maintain a straight line, and the various piazza can be confusing to the newcomer.

Here in Montenapoleone Street (with prime brand shops), Della Spiga Street, Vittorio Emanuele Street, Sant' Andrea Street, Porta Venezia avenue and Manzoni Street, it contains the most prestigious boutiques and showrooms in the world.

The Brera district is great for other things, such as browsing through ancient rare art stores and galleries, sipping a hot drink at a refined-air cafe, attending a funky disco, or looking for exotic furniture. However, today, there are a lot of young designers who have up-and coming boutiques, which are slightly less expensive than their Montenapoleone counterparts, but are quite fashionable and of high quality. The Brera district is great because it combines chic, old-air shops, with zeitgeist, modernist and youthful ones. Jewelry stores include Papic oro e argento or Alcozer & J.

In the Corso Giacomo, you can find Abercrombie & Fitch, in Piazza del Duomo you have Grimoldi, Ruggeri, Donna and La Rinascente department store, in Piazza San Babila you can find Upim, Eddy Monetti, Guess and Valextra, and there are loads of shops in the Via Dante, so there are really heaps of shopping opportunities in this area.\n\nFor hipsters, there's the elongated ",{"type":"{{","value":[["Marker"],["type=buy"],["lat=45.45285"],["long=9.18028"],["name=Porta Ticinese"]]}," area, especially on Saturday, when the flea market ",{"type":"'''","value":["Fiera di Senigallia"]}," takes place near the Darsena (2008: currently that area is closed and Fiera di Senigallia has been moved to a place near Porta Genova MM2 subway and train station). This is a great place to wander and browse, and save money if you've somehow survived Milan's high end boutiques. Sort through new and second-hand clothes, old furniture, fake art nouveau lamps, perfumed candles and every kind of essence, books, comics, records, videos and DVDs. In the Corso Ticense, several shops, such as Diesel, RVM Orologi, Dress, Energie, Colors & Beauty, Tintoria La Boutique, Blu Max, Le Jean Marie, Brazilian, Ethic, L'Uomo outlet, Les Tropezziennes, Atelier cucine e ..., Panca's Show Room, or Cinius (and loads more) are present.

This city's traditional cooking is based on filling dishes like ",{"type":"''","value":["osso buco"]}," (braised veal shanks) and ",{"type":"''","value":["risotto alla milanese"]}," (chicken-broth risotto made with saffron).\n\nDining times tend to be a shade earlier than in Rome or Florence, with lunch generally served between 12:30 and 14:30 and dinner from 19:30 to 21:30. Dinner, and sometimes lunch, are usually preceded by that great Milanese institution, the aperitivoâ€”a glass of sparkling wine or a Campari soda in a sophisticated hotel bar.\n\nAvoid the restaurants around the Duomo, they tend to be tourist-only spots, with low quality food at inflated prices. Be aware that most restaurants charge an extra \"serving tax\" or \"table rent\", about â‚¬2 per consumer. Also avoid restaurants or cafes around the central station, where it has been reported that hidden serving tax can be up to â‚¬5 per person with cheap quality food.\n\nThere is much confusion regarding tipping in Italy. Italians do not typically leave tips anymore at restaurants. In touristy locations there will often be a line (a recent trend) left blank for a tip to be added. Just draw a line through it and leave a couple of euros. Never leave tips at bar counters.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Breakfast"]},"\nIn bars you can enjoy great caffÃ¨ espresso, cappuccino and a brioche for as little as â‚¬2.

But be careful not to confuse \"aperitivo\" with \"free dinner\". It's a snack to be enjoyed with a drink.

In many pubs and bars you can find a free booklet named ",{"type":"'''","value":["Zero2"]}," which is a guide to Milan Nightlife: if you don't know what to do or where to go, do grab one!\n\nOther popular night spots with bars and people are ",{"type":"{{","value":[["Marker"],["type=drink"],["lat=45.45691"],["long=9.20521"],["name=Viale Monte Nero"]]}," (on Wednesday it's packed with people in the piazza in front of a bar called \"Momo\"), ",{"type":"{{","value":[["Marker"],["type=drink"],["lat=45.46815"],["long=9.22442"],["name=Piazzale Susa"]]}," (and nearby Citta' Studi area).

However, Wednesday night appears to be one of the coolest to go out in stylish VIP-frequented clubs.\n\nMilan has an alternative club scene, with a few crews making electronic music parties outside clubs. Ultracheap, every time in a different location (lofts, warehouses, farms, pools, city parks) those kind of parties attract people aged 20â€“28. The biggest one is called ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.wearereset.com RESET!"]},"and attracts 1500-2000 people once a month\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Gay and Lesbian Travellers"]},"\nAlthough Milan has a variety of bars, clubs, restaurants and venues for gay and lesbian travellers, many only operate one night a week. Choosing from one of the \"mainstays\" below and asking anyone where to go should lead you in the right direction. Also, venues are not concentrated in one area of town, but rather spread throughout the city. \n\nForeign travelers are often confused by the ARCI card regime that is required for entry into many clubs. It's a relic from the times of police raids that has now conferred tax benefits on these private club owners. No need to fearâ€”just show up and purchase one at any of the clubs.

This is a rather shabby part of the city where you can run into dubious individuals especially at nighttime. On the other hand the hotels are clean and safe, for the most part streets are lit and the metro station isn't far away.

At the station, do not seek help from any random person offering to help with the booking machines \/ ATMs or under any other pretext. After they have helped, they will pursue you to get as much money as possible for their \"help\". Or they can pretend to be helpful, cheating instead. A possible scenario: they guide you through the interface of the ticket machine in a metro station, and advice you to pay using notes instead of coins (allegedly the ticket machine wouldn't accept coins). If you insert a 20 euro note, the machine would give it back after a few moments. However, before it happens, they will grab your attention saying that the ticket should appear in the bottom of the machine, and simultaneously an old beggar with body odor will appear begging for money. You wouldn't notice it but the beggar will collect the 20 euro note that the machine would give  back to you. The \"helper\" would then show to you that the maximum amount of change given by the machine is less than 10 euros.\n\nBeware of the migrant vendors in the streets: most of the merchandise they sell is ",{"type":"'''","value":["imitation\/fake luxury goods"]},". Even at a fraction of the cost of the original merchandise, the quality is spotty, and the goods are not well maintained in storage. Remember that it's illegal to bring pirated goods into some countries and therefore such souvenirs might get even more expensive when trying to bring them home. \n\nThey may also try giving you \"free\" friendship bracelets (sometimes calling them 'a gift').  After you take the bracelet, a coloured piece of string, they will hit you up for money and relentlessly pursue you until they get as much as they can. They will be forceful, physically tying the bracelet to your wrist, or laying it on your shoulder as you try and walk away. This is especially true in the tourist areas around the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Duomo"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Castello Sforzesco"]},". They usually first ask \"Where are you from?\" Just ignore them. In empty places, watch for strangers directly approaching you. Try to be with other people like in a bus station or a shopping mall.\n\nBeware of people hanging around the square outside Duomo: they will walk up to you and forcefully give you corn on the hands to feed the pigeons on the pretense that they are free. All the pigeons in the surrounding area will then fly to you. The people will then relentlessly pursue you and ask you for money.\n\nBe careful crossing the street: drivers don't usually respect pedestrian crossings unless there is a red light for them to stop.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Lake Como"]]}]},"â€” A huge, impressive, beautiful lake in the foothills of the Alps.

With over 20 million visitors having come ever since its opening in 2000, you can find luxurious designer names, such as Dolce & Gabbana, Etro, Diesel, Roberto Cavalli, Ferragamo, Timberland, Tommy Hilfiger, Prada, Geox, Swatch, Bulgari, Swarovski, and several more (at bargain prices)! Then, if you want to have a meal, you can stop for some fast-foods at Burger King or the Italian Spizzico, have an ice-cream or sip at a drink in a cafÃ©. Despite the slightly long trip, it makes a truly great day out, and is heaven for any fashionista or passionate shopper! Tour company-operated buses, including one that leaves from near the Castle, will take you there and back (roughly â‚¬20 for the round-trip as of early 2008).
