Attempts to halve that time for visitors by drilling a new Milford Tunnel linking Routeburn and Hollyford Valleys have been strenuously quashed over the potentially huge environmental impact.\n\nLike the rest of the west coast of New Zealand, Milford Sound receives a lot of rain. Some tour operators argue that the sound is best seen on a rainy day as all the waterfalls can be seen in their full glory. Many recommend seeing it during a sunny day and in the rain, to see both worlds as they are very different and both amazing.\n\nIt rains every second day on average, so rainwear is recommended and carry an umbrella to protect photographic equipment. Also as with most of the west coast, insect repellent is recommended as the sand flies here can be aggressive.\n\nOnce you make the spectacular journey to the fiord, there are a number of tourist boats and services to take you out to see the sights.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.queenstown.net.nz\/index.php?title=Milford_Sound_Airport Milford Sound Airport"]}]}," serves the locality.

Cons are that it is quite hard work and you should be prepared to get cold and wet. A good way of doing this kind of trip is on a 'one day package'. You can be picked up from your lodgings early in the morning (around 06:30) in Te Anau by minibus and driven to Milford, where you are kitted out with all the relevant kayak and safety gear and given waterproof bags to take cameras and food with you.
