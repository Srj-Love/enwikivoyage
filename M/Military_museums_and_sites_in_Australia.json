While over 20,000 Indigenous Australians and between 2,000 and 2,500 settlers are estimated to have been killed, there are very few monuments or memorials to the frontier wars, and no battle sites have been preserved.\n\nDuring the colonial era (1788-1901) barracks and coastal fortifications were established around the colonial capital cities. Britain stationed forces in Australia until the country achieved independence in 1901, though it ceased deploying land forces to the continent in 1870.\n\nThere was virtually no fighting in or near Australia during World War I, but camps were established to train the men of the Australian Imperial Force before they were deployed overseas. Australia's defences were improved in the lead up to World War II, with new coastal defences and strategic airstrips being established. Following the rapid Japanese victories in 1941 and 1942 the Australian Government and many Australians feared that the country faced invasion (though the Japanese had no such plans), and these defences were further improved. As the war turned in the favour of the Allies a network of airfields and major Army bases was established in Queensland and the Northern Territory to support the Allied counter-offensive in the Pacific. In the years after World War II most of the airfields and virtually all of the coastal fortifications were abandoned by the military.\n\nThe modern Australian Defence Force operates from bases which are generally located in or adjacent to major cities. Few of these facilities are open to the public, but some have small museums on their outskirts which can be visited.\n\nThe Australian War Memorial, located in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Canberra"]]},", is Australia's main military history museum, and also serves as a memorial to the men and women killed during wars and peacekeeping deployments. Each of the three services (the Royal Australian Navy, Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force) maintains a central museum as well as a network of smaller specialised museums. There are also a large number of government and independently-run military history museums. Most towns and the older suburbs of the large cities have a small war memorial which lists the names of the locals killed in war: these serve as the focal points of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["ANZAC Day"]}," dawn services on 25 April each year. Some of the former coastal fortifications and barracks have been opened to the public.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Prepare"]},"\nA huge number of books have been written on Australia's military history.

",{"type":"''","value":["Sacred Places : War Memorials in the Australian Landscape"]}," by Ken Inglis discusses the establishment of these monuments and how attitudes to them have changed over time. \n\nThere are also many books and websites on individual historic sites within Australia. Local histories often discuss the region's experiences during the world wars, and many of the towns in northern Australia have been the subject of books on their experience of World War II. While many of these works are self-published by amateur historians, the general quality is good. Virtually all military museums maintain a website.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Australian Capital Territory"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Australian War Memorial.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["The courtyard of the Australian War Memorial"]]},"\n;Museums\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Australian War Memorial"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.awm.gov.au\/"],["email="],["address=Treloar Crescent, Campbell ACT"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=10am – 5pm daily, except for Christmas Day"],["price=Free"],["content=Generally considered one of Australia's best museums, the Australian War Memorial provides an in-depth examination of the country's involvement in war and peacekeeping.
