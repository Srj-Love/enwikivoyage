If your destination in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Francisco"]]}," or your point of departure from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Francisco"]]}," is anywhere near the 4th & King Caltrain station (near the South Beach area of SOMA), you should take the Caltrain rather than BART.  The Caltrain trip between San Francisco and Millbrae is 18 minutes (\"baby bullet\"), 20 minutes (express), or 31 minutes (local).  BART takes 36 minutes to San Francisco's Montgomery Station, and Caltrain is a far more pleasant ride.  However, Caltrain takes more planning; it runs less frequently with more limited hours than BART.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nThe San Mateo Transit District, ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.samtrans.com\/index.html samTrans"]}]},", provide bus service around Millbrae and beyond.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Millbrae Pancake House"]}," 1301 El Camino Real, Millbrae, CA 94030-1410,  (650) 589-2080,  Open late.
