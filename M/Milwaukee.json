The city's population is 605,013 with an estimated total of 1,741,316 in the Milwaukee metropolitan area (2009). It is the 22nd largest city in the U.S. and is in the southeastern portion of the state on the western shore of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Lake Michigan"]},".\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Milwaukee Art Museum.JPG"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Milwaukee Art Museum"]]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History and Culture"]},"\nMilwaukee's human history begins with American Indian people who lived near the confluence of Milwaukee's three rivers into Lake Michigan for centuries. Tribes who inhabited the area that is now Milwaukee included Menominee, Fox, Mascouten, Sauk, and Potawatomi. With the arrival of Europeans and an increasing population, large and often violent divides become more prominent. These settlers built three dueling settlements (Juneautown, Kilbourntown, and Walker's Point) around what is now Downtown. The two former communities were extremely competitive and created two non-aligning street grids. This is why 1st Street is west of the Milwaukee River and the reason that many of the city's bridges cross the river diagonally (connecting the two grids).\n\nMilwaukee has historically been a major immigrant city. During the early 20th Century, German and Polish immigrants tended to dominate, and the city still strongly identifies with its German and, to a slightly lesser extent, Polish heritage. For part of the early 20th century German was even the main language of the city, and German names are still very common.\n\nAs waves of immigrants arrived in Milwaukee they tended (and tend) to form communities in specific areas. The different areas of the city are still identified with the ethnic groups that originally populated them. The Near North and Northwest sides were originally German, but are now mainly African American with Hmong enclaves. The Near South side was originally Polish but is now mainly Hispanic. Juneautown was originally mainly populated by English immigrants as well as people from the eastern United States.\n\nThe city experienced 'white flight' during the 1960s and 70's, creating a large socio-economic divide between the inner city and suburbs. Today the city remains highly segregated with low rates of social and economic mobility within the inner city.\n\nMilwaukee is home to some instantly recognized corporations such as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Miller Brewing"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Harley Davidson"]},". Harley holds an enormous celebration on every fifth anniversary attracting riders (and celebrity riders such as Jay Leno) by the millions to Milwaukee each time. The 110th anniversary will be held in 2013.\n\nMilwaukee was once the home to four of the world's largest breweries (Schlitz, Blatz, Pabst, and Miller), making it the number one beer producing city in the world for many years. Despite the decline in its position as the world's leading beer producer through the loss of three of those breweries, its one remaining major brewery, Miller Brewing Company is a key employer. Miller employs over 2,200 people on Milwaukee's west side. All this beer brewing has earned the city the nickname \"Brew City\" and its identification with and fondness for beer remains strong as ever.\n\nMilwaukee has advertised itself as the \"City of Festivals,\" especially emphasizing an annual summer party along the lakefront called ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.summerfest.com\/ Summerfest"]}]},". Listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as \"the largest music festival in the world\", Summerfest attracts about a million visitors a year to its twelve stages.

Like in most American cities, dangerous neighborhoods tend to be very run down.\n\nThe areas of Milwaukee along the lakeshore (also there where most attractions are) tend to be the safest.\n\nThe west and south sides of Milwaukee also offer interesting tourist opportunities that include Milwaukee's famous Basilica and Frank Lloyd Wright's Greek Orthodox church. Crime can happen anywhere; don't let geographic stereotypes dictate your travels.\n\nThe area bounded by I-43 on the east, Capitol Dr on the north, North Ave on the south and Sherman Blvd on the west contains some of the poorest areas of the city and is especially dangerous. The Near South Side also has serious gang-related crime problems but is fine during the day, especially along the main commercial streets.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Newspapers"]},"\nMany community and neighborhood oriented weekly papers are offered for free in cafes and coffee shops.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.jsonline.com The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel"]}]}," is Milwaukee's only major daily newspaper, distributed in the morning. $0.50 daily, $1.75 Sunday Edition."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.shepherd-express.com The Shepherd Express"]}]}," is Milwaukee's free-press publication."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.2centsmke.com Two Cents MKE"]}]}," is a unique creative guide to discovering Milwaukee, a free bi-monthly magazine."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.avclub.com\/milwaukee The Onion"]}]}," is distributed free all over the place and has a good local events listing called ",{"type":"''","value":["The A.V.

Milwaukee is not as socially liberal as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Madison (Wisconsin)"],["Madison"]]},", although people in Milwaukee are overall tolerant of each other, even if many of the assorted social and ethnic groups tend to avoid each other.  Clique culture is big in the region and many people grew up together so don't be surprised to get an unfriendly reception from some people you meet being an outsider.  Dressing in a non-conservative manner here (keeping up with fashion trends, v-necks, high fashion, etc.) is generally frowned upon in southeast Wisconsin and will get you some funny looks from locals so if this kind of attention bothers you then pack accordingly.
