The culprit, Chisso Corporation — the town's largest employer by far — did all it could to avoid blame, including suppressing internal research showing that its wastewater caused the disease in cats and later claiming it had cleaned up its wastewater in 1959 while in fact it hadn't, leading to an epidemic of severe birth defects.  When the second wave of cases broke out, photographer W. Eugene Smith brought the disease to the world's attention in 1972, and was severely beaten for his trouble by yakuza goons.
