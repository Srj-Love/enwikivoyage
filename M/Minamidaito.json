The island is known as ",{"type":"''","value":["Minamidaitō-jima"]}," (南大東島) and the village is ",{"type":"''","value":["Minamidaitō-son"]}," (南大東村). The name is also sometimes written as ",{"type":"''","value":["Minami Daito"]},", or ",{"type":"''","value":["Minamidaitou"]},".  With 1400 inhabitants, it has about twice the population of nearby ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kitadaito"]]},".\n\nMinamidaito was first discovered in 1820 by a Russian ",{"type":"''","value":["Borodino"]},"-class marine vessel and named ",{"type":"'''","value":["South Borodino Island"]},". The sharp cliffs surrounding the whole island made it inaccessible to humans  until in 1900 a Japanese pioneering team from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hachijō"]]}," Island became the first inhabitants of the island, using the land to grow sugarcane. Minamidaito continues to produce sugarcane as its main source of revenue; it also runs factories for refining the sugar and producing a unique brand of rum called ",{"type":"''","value":["Cor Cor"]},".\n\nAs a tourist destination, Minamidaito is one for the adventurous - flight tickets are not cheap and ferries are few, but the fascinating ethnic nature, culture and hospitality of the place can easily make it worth the cost, even just for a weekend visit. Everything about Minamidaito is unique, from the unique cultural blend between Okinawa and its ancestral Hachijo to the unique plant, fish and animal species. It's home to Japan's largest weather station and Japan's shortest airline flight.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Minamidaito-119.jpg"],["thumb"],["Passengers board the ferry via crane"]]},"\n\nThe only way to get to Minamidaito is from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Naha"]]}," or neighboring ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kitadaito"]]}," either by plane or ferry. There are two flights per day from Naha, which can be reserved up to two months in advance from Naha Airport or by telephone or internet with Japan Airlines. Flights last about 70 minutes and cost ¥31,600 for a roundtrip(in 2011) or 24,900 for one way. The ferry costs around ¥10,000 for a roundtrip, but sails only once per week and takes 15-17 hours each way. The timetable is decided about a month before.　Check with ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.daitoline.com\/ Daito Line"]}," (homepage in Japanese only).\n\nThe flight between Minamidaito and Kitadaito lasts for 3 minutes or 15 minutes counting takeoff and landing, and is the shortest airline flight in Japan. At 8300 yen it is comparatively no doubt the most expensive too.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nThe main village complex is easily navigable on foot. For the outer sights there is a rental service for cars and bicycles, but locals are always happy to offer a lift.\n\nThe first place to stop by is the Visitor Center (",{"type":"''","value":["bijitaa sentaa"]},") from which  the manager, Kazuaki Higashi (Higashi-san), will help to organise your sightseeing needs. He organizes tours to the underground cave (",{"type":"''","value":["Chiteiko"]},"), night wildlife sightseeing...\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nIf you cannot speak Japanese, it will be important to bring a phrasebook. Almost all of the native islanders have virtually no comprehension of English. On the other hand, due to the presence of school staff, university students and migrants from the Philippines, there should be one or two English speakers somewhere to be found.\n\nEriko Yoshizato, the manager of Yoshizato Hotel, speaks good English and will be able to help with any queries.\n\nIf you have studied Japanese, you will have a great opportunity to practice the Okinawan dialect and the rarer Hachijo dialect.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Minami Daito Jima ISS002.jpg"],["thumb"],["The island seen from above."]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bats"]}," - Daito's unique bat, the ",{"type":"''","value":["okomori"]},", will usually be eating fruit in the ",{"type":"''","value":["fukugi"]}," trees at night.
