[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"],["pgname=Minden"]]},"\nWelcome to one of the world's most special places. Minden, Nebraska. Where history, tradition, & culture come to life.\n\nMinden, known as \"The Christmas City\", is a picturesque small town located on the wide-open prairie of south central Nebraska. It was settled by Danish, Swedish, and German immigrants. It was incorporated in 1883. The community is proud of its progressive heritage.\n\nThe heart of the community of nearly 3,000 is the Minden Town Square, located one block east and four blocks south of the Harold Warp Pioneer Village. Up-to-date shops line the four sides of this charming square along with the beautifully restored Minden Opera House. The Kearney County Courthouse stands in the center of the town square. Its huge, white dome is a landmark visible for miles.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Grace Elizabeth's Bed & Breakfast"],["url=http:\/\/www.graceelizabethsbb.com"],["email=stay@graceelizabethsbb.com"],["address=1523 N Brown Avenue"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 308 832-1213"],["tollfree=+1-866-809-1972"],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox\/Concurrency"],["image1=US 6.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["image1a=US 34.svg"],["imagesize1a=22"],["image1b="],["imagesize1b="],["directionl1=W"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sterling (Colorado)"],["Sterling"]]},"\/",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fort Morgan (Colorado)"],["Fort Morgan"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Holdrege"]]}],["directionr1=E"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lincoln (Nebraska)"],["Lincoln"]]},"\/",{"type":"[[","value":[["Grand Island (Nebraska)"],["Grand Island"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hastings (Nebraska)"],["Hastings"]]}],["image2="],["imagesize2="],["directionl2="],["majorl2="],["minorl2="],["directionr2="],["majorr2="],["minorr2="]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["40.498056"],["-98.951111"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["South Central Nebraska"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Minden, Nebraska"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North_America\/United_States\/Nebraska\/Localities\/M\/Minden\/"]]}]
