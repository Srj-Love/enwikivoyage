The arrivals hall is new. No trolleys, no advice - just a big room with security guys and closed doors to the people outside waiting for the arrivals. Non RU travellers will need Visa support documentation because - once inside your taxi, you will be stopped at the perimeter by the militia and unless your documentation is correct, you will be returned to the departure hall so that you can leave the region.\n\nLeaving is not so simple. Everyone is screened at the entrance to the departure hall. There are 2 check-in desks and nothing resembling an organized queue. Having been processed for departure, you are directed to weigh your luggage and - if given the 'all clear' - you have to merge the free-for-all again, to collect your baggage identification. Then you need to join the next queue - to scan the luggage again and wait for instructions - if it is to be accepted or not.\n\nAirport toilets are eastern style. Refreshments consist of a babushka selling home-made sandwiches and bottled water. It is possible to buy swords and daggers from the region and the woman next to this will get them engraved for you.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nPlease note there are lots of buses and taxis in Mineralnye Vody.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Mount Elbrus"]}," located not far away in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kabardino-Balkaria"]]},", Elbrus is visible on a clear day from MinVody."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nPolice in this town can be bribed easily.
