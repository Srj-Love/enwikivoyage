[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Welcome banner.jpg"]]},"\nThe Chinese dialect that originated in Southern part of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fujian"]]}," province — the area around ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Xiamen"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Quanzhou"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zhangzhou"]]}," — has several names. In the language itself, it is ",{"type":"''","value":["bân-lâm-ōe"]},". In Mandarin, it is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Minnan hua"]}," (閩南話), which translates as Southern Min (Fujian) speech. The same language is widely spoken in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Taiwan"]]}," where it is referred to as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Taiwanese"]}," (臺彎話 tâi-oan-ōe), in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Philippines"]]}," where it is referred to as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Lan Nang Oe"]}," (咱人話 lán-lâng-ōe), and in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southeast Asia"]]}," where it is called ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hokkien"]}," (福建話 hok-kiàn-ōe), the Minnan pronunciation of 'Fujian'.\n\n\"Minnan\", \"Hokkien\" and \"Taiwanese\" are all used in English, and all refer to basically the same language. This article calls it Minnan, and is based on the language as spoken in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Xiamen"]]},", often considered the standard version.\n\nAll these variants are mutually intelligible but have some differences, due to borrowing of words from different languages and sometimes language evolution due to relative isolation. Most notably, Taiwanese has borrowed some words from Japanese, so \"uncle\" would be known as \"ojisan\" in Taiwan instead of 阿伯 \"a-pek\" (father's elder brother), 阿叔 \"a-chek\" or 阿舅 \"a-kū\" (mother's brother) as in Xiamen. The variant spoken in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zhangzhou"]]}," has some subtle differences from the Xiamen variant but is largely mutually intelligible (eg. ",{"type":"''","value":["kiam nui"]}," instead of ",{"type":"''","value":["kiam neng"]}," for salted egg). The variants spoken in Singapore and Malaysia have extensive borrowing from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Malay phrasebook"],["Malay"]]}," and to a lesser extent ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cantonese phrasebook"],["Cantonese"]]}," and English.\n\nLinguists consider Minnan related to other Chinese dialects — ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hainanese"]]},", spoken on the island of Hainan, and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Teochew"]]}," (or Chiuchao) spoken around ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chaozhou"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shantou"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guangdong"]]}," — but the differences are significant and these are not mutually intelligible. e.g. Teochew has chı̍t-kâi-nâng instead of chı̍t-ê-lâng for '一個人').\n\nMinnan is not mutually intelligible with standard ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mandarin"]]}," or other Chinese dialects, not even other Min (Fujian) dialects such as Mindong (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fuzhou Hua"]]},"), Minbei and Puxian. This is not only due to the pronunciation differences but also because of the irregular word\/character conversion i.e. a non-native Minnan speaker can only understand the dialect to a small extent even when it is presented in written form (e.g. \"吃甲尚好驚血壓高,水姆兌人走\" : 《陳雷.歡喜就好》).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Pronunciation"]},"\n\nLike all other Chinese languages and their dialects, Minnan uses Chinese characters but employs its own 'unique' pronunciation. However, it should be noted that similar to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Japanese phrasebook"],["Japanese"]]}," kanji, most characters have two or more pronunciations in Minnan, which means that many characters would be pronounced ",{"type":"'''","value":["differently"]}," depending on context, even if their Mandarin pronunciation remains the same in both instances.\n\nThis is partly due to the fact that, because standard written Chinese is based on Mandarin, many words in Minnan are written with characters of the same meaning in standard written Chinese.\n\nFor example, the words ",{"type":"''","value":["ài"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["beh"]}," both roughly mean 'want', so they are usually written with the character 要 (although they are also written with 愛 and 欲 respectively). Consequently, the pronouncation of the character 要 can change between ",{"type":"''","value":["ài"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["beh"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["iàu"]}," depending on context.\n\nThe ordinary word for person, ",{"type":"''","value":["lâng"]},", is usually written with the character 人, which also has the reading ",{"type":"''","value":["jı̂n"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["lîn"]},". The character 生 is pronounced ",{"type":"''","value":["seⁿ"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["siⁿ"]}," as a verb used alone, but the word 人生 is pronounced ",{"type":"''","value":["lı̂n-seng"]},".\n\nAlso, note how the words m̄ (is not, does not) and bē\/bōe (cannot) are all often written with 不, so while 不要 might be read as ",{"type":"''","value":["m̄-ài"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["m̄-beh"]},", 不能\/不可 can be read as ",{"type":"''","value":["bē-sái"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["bōe-sái"]},".\n\nFor refering to oneself, 我 góa is used in more informal context while 阮 gún is more formal and 恁爸 lı́n-pē is very derogatory but used very commonly. (No cognates exist in Mandarin or Cantonese although phrases with the same meaning do.) Similar to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Malay phrasebook"],["Malay"]]},", there are two equivalents of the English word \"we\", with lan-nang including the listener in the group, and goa-nang used to exclude the listener from the group.\n\nPronunciation varies from region to region (e.g. 你 (",{"type":"''","value":["you"]},") can be either ",{"type":"''","value":["lı́"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["lú"]},"). This can make comprehension difficult sometimes even between 'native' speakers from different regions. It should also be kept in mind that most speakers of the dialect often mix Mandarin phrases into their speech due to the influence of Standard Mandarin.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Tones "]},"\n\nLike other varieties of Chinese, Minnan is tonal; tones must be correct in order to convey the correct meaning. Tone sandhi is particularly common and non-standardised in Minnan, which makes it a little harder to learn than Mandarin, where tone sandhi is standardised, and Cantonese, where tone sandhi is used sparingly.\n\nThe following table shows the values of the different tones in some places, and does ",{"type":"'''","value":["not"]}," show the pronouncation of the tones or tone sandhi of many areas, but may give an idea of the approximate values.\n\n",{"type":"{|","value":[["border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\""],["|+ Tones of Minnan"],["|-"],["!

While Mandarin only distinguishes between aspirated and unaspirated (unvoiced) consonants, and English only distinguishes between voiced and unvoiced consonants meaning-wise, Minnan makes a distinction in both cases. This means that aspirated unvoiced (pʰ, tʰ, kʰ), unaspirated unvoiced (p, t, k), and unaspirated voiced (b, d, g) are all separate phonemic consonants in Minnan.\n\nTo highlight the distinction, the words for \"open\" (開) and \"close\" (關), in some pronuncations (khui and kui respectively) sound almost identical to a native English speaker, only difference being that \"open\" uses an aspirated initial k while \"close\" uses an unaspirated initial k! The j sound in English is also used along with the j sound in Mandarin hanyu pinyin. Labial initials such as the m sound are also present. However, unlike in Mandarin, there is no \"tongue rolling\" (pinyin ",{"type":"''","value":["zh"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["ch"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["sh"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["r"]},") initial consonant.\n\n",{"type":"{|","value":[["border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\""],["|+ Initial consonanats of POJ"],["!

In POJ, the nasal consonants ",{"type":"''","value":["m"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["n"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["ng"]}," are pronounced the same as English, but the others are different.\n\nThe stop consonants ",{"type":"''","value":["p"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["t"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["k"]}," are unreleased. This means that the mouth moves into the position of making the consonant, but no burst of air is released.\n\nFurthermore, an ",{"type":"''","value":["h"]}," at the end of a syllable in POJ represents a glottal stop (ʔ); this is the sound in the middle of the English word 'uh-oh'.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Vowels"]},"\n\nThe vowels ",{"type":"''","value":["a"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["e"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["i"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["o"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["u"]}," are pronounced as they are in many languages, such as Spanish. Minnan also has the vowel [ɔ] written as ",{"type":"''","value":["o͘"]}," (with a dot) or ",{"type":"''","value":["oo"]},".\n\n",{"type":"{|","value":[["border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\""],["|+ Vowels of POJ"],["!

It can also be indicated with a capital n (",{"type":"''","value":["N"]},") or a double n (nn). IPA notes this with a tilde (~) above the last vowel.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Common diphthongs"]},"\n\nThere are many diphthongs in Minnan, and there pronunciation from the POJ spelling is generally fairly obvious.
