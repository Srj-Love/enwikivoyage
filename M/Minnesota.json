Minnesotans' cheery attitude combined with a sing-song accent contrasts them with their fellow Midwesterners. Also, Minnesota represents a rare left-wing presence in the Midwestern United States, famously described in the book ",{"type":"''","value":["Main Street"]}," by Minnesota author Sinclair Lewis as Mr. Stowbody, \"Trouble enough with these foreign farmers; if you don't watch these Swedes they turn socialist or populist or some fool thing on you in a minute.\" In fact, these Swedes and foreign farmers did turn socialist, forming the Farmer-Labor Party in 1918, electing 3 successive governors, four senators and eight US representatives, until it merged with the Minnesota Democratic party in 1944. The state still maintains liberal leanings and is home to the second largest openly homosexual population in the US. Combine Minnesota's cultural eccentricities with its beautiful forests and lakes and you have a gem for any tourist in the Midwestern US.\n\nUnlike many other US states that sport several major urban centers, most of Minnesota's urban culture is centered in the \"Twin Cities\" of Minneapolis and St. Paul, which effectively form one large city divided into separate political areas.  Although other urban centers exist in Rochester and Duluth the centralization of population, wealth and political power in the Twin Cities makes visiting \"the Cities\" a very different experience than the rest of the state.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nThe stereotypical Minnesotan dialect as popularized in the film ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fargo"]]}," is more prevalent in northern (Iron Range) and rural parts of the state than it is in the Twin Cities metropolitan area. In fact, in the metropolitan area, the accent is rarely noticed by visitors, much less the locals. The dialect is characterized by long vowels and a slight inflection (especially Os as found in the word \"boat\"). The sing-songy intonation is less common with each generation removed from the Scandinavian ancestors. Native Americans (primarily Ojibwe) have an accent of their own.\n\nIn addition to a unique dialect, Minnesota also has several phrases and colloquial expressions that can be overheard somewhat frequently.

Bars and restaurants that serve liquor may do so until 2am, although not all do (especially on Sunday through Thursday), and some municipalities may enforce an earlier closing time. Unlike most other states, you ",{"type":"''","value":["cannot"]}," buy alcohol in a grocery store or convenience store, unless it is \"3.2 beer\", which is a low-alcohol beer containing only 3.2% alcohol by weight (4% alcohol by volume). Some grocery stores don't even bother selling 3.2 beer even though they are allowed to, a testament to the state's rather prevalent drinking culture. If you want regular beer, wine, or liquor, but don't want to drink it at a restaurant or bar, then you must go to a liquor store. Although liquor stores are plentiful, they have uncommon hours that visitors should be aware of: First, liquor stores are ",{"type":"''","value":["closed"]}," on Sundays in accordance with the law, meaning that you cannot purchase any alcohol for home consumption on that day (bars and restaurants can serve alcohol on Sundays). Also, liquor stores are generally required to close fairly early (10pm or earlier). Unlike some states, the bars here generally won't sell liquor \"to go\". This is less of a problem if you are near the border of a neighboring state with less restrictive liquor laws. Residents of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Twin Cities"]]}," region have been known to make the short drive to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wisconsin"]]}," on Sundays to purchase alcohol. Despite this puritanical approach to alcohol sales, even rural towns have a fairly active drinking culture (the cliche of \"more bars than churches\"). Identification is checked less often than in other states, though it happens more frequently in areas with a high amount of college students or tourists.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Severe Weather"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Thunderstorms and Tornadoes"]},"\nDuring the spring and summer seasons, the state (particularly its southern region) has the tendency to experience violent thunderstorms which do, on occasion, spawn ",{"type":"'''","value":["tornadoes"]},". It is a good idea to pay attention to weather conditions during these seasons to maintain an awareness of any potential for these severe storms to occur. Keep in mind that weather conditions change very quickly, and therefore, frequently updating yourself in regards to the conditions is something to consider while traveling to or through the state during the spring\/summer seasons.\n\nRefer to the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tornado safety"]]}," page for more information.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Winter Storms"]},"\n\nMinnesota also can have very cold winters and very warm, humid summers. Be sure to pack accordingly.\n\nWhen traveling outside major metropolitan areas during winter months it is advisable to take extra blankets or warm weather gear in the event of an accident or mechanical difficulties.  One rule of thumb for native Minnesotans is to always have your vehicle's gas tank at least half full during the winter months.  The high temperatures during the winter are typically in 10-30 degree range, but can go below zero a few weeks during the winter.  Native Minnesotans are taught to bundle up and wear layers during the winter at a very early age.  You might also note that unlike many other states, Minnesotans are quite accustomed to driving on icy and snowy roads. Furthermore, the Minnesota Department of Motor Vehicles has a great number of snowplows that clear and salt roads after snowstorms. Therefore do not be surprised if businesses and schools remain open even after a heavy snowfall.  \n\nIn winter months, make sure to check the ice thickness before going out on a frozen lake or pond. Do not park your vehicle on a lake or pond unless it is deemed safe by the local DNR officers. Never walk on river ice. It may appear safe but may not be thick enough to support your weight, due to the river current flowing underneath.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Camping"]},"\n\nMinnesota - the land of 10,000 Lakes - has beautiful wilderness and camping sites.
