Mino City is specifically known for its production of traditional Japanese paper. An annual Japanese paper lantern festival has been held in Mino since about 2003.

The festival is held over one weekend in early- or mid-October. (Check the link for details.) Contestants from around the country build and submit hundreds of illuminated displays out of traditional Japanese paper. Designs range from abstract to exotic, and a handful of winners (often professional designers) receive awards and cash prizes on the second day of the event. Thousands attend this event each year, meaning parking becomes sparse within the city. Arrive at least two hours before dark to find a free parking space near the event. Alternatively, the city converts soccer and baseball fields into parking lots for each night of the event. The charge is reasonable (about 500 yen), and shuttle buses are chartered at 10 minute intervals between these makeshift parking lots and the event itself. The festival generally runs from dusk until about 9PM\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=Tokai-Hokuriku Expwy Route Sign.svg"],["imagesize1=100"],["directionl1=N"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Takayama"]]}],["minorl1=Gujohachiman"],["directionr1=S"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ichinomiya"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gifu"],["Gifu-kagamigahara"]]}],["image2=Tokai-Kanjo Expwy Route Sign.svg"],["imagesize2=100"],["directionl2=W"],["majorl2=END"],["minorl2="],["directionr2=E"],["majorr2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Toyota"]]}],["minorr2=Minokamo ",{"type":"{{","value":[["rtarrow"]]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Toki"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Gifu (prefecture)"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["35.544722222222"],["136.9075"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Mino, Gifu"]]}]
