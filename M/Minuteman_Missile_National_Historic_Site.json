Minuteman missiles held the destructive power to destroy civilization as we know it. Yet the same destructive force acted as a deterrent which kept the peace for three decades. Minuteman Missile makes it possible to revisit a time when the threat of nuclear war haunted the world.\n\nA Minuteman Missile can strike a target over 6,000 miles away in less then half an hour. Because it moves at speeds of over 15,000 miles an hour a Minuteman could cross the United States from East to West in just over 10 minutes. By comparison to drive the same distance would take 40 hours.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nWeather in South Dakota can be quite variable throughout the year.
