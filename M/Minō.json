Railway buffs take note: this was among the first pieces of the Hankyu railway system.\n\nYou can also take the Subway Midosuji (Red) line to Senri-Chuo station and then at bus stop 11 you can catch either the 19 or 20 bus to Minoo Station (箕面駅). The 19 takes you past a hospital and takes about 10 minutes longer than the 20. The bus ride takes 15 to 25 mins depending on traffic. \n\nBuses run from Senri-Chuo every 15 minutes until about 10pm. \n\nThere is a flat fare of 210 yen for adults.\n\nYou can also take a taxi. Taxi's generally cost about 1,400 yen. It varies depending on the time and day. Weekends are usually more expensive.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Getting around"]},"\n\nThe main sights in Minō Park can be reached on foot. \n\nIf you want to visit Minoo VISOLA, a large shopping mall with many fun shops and a movie theater with one of the only IMAX screens in Japan, you can take the 19 or 20 bus from Minoo Station to Kayano-chuo bus stop. If you leave from Senri-Chuo station, there is a loop bus that runs every fifteen minutes from the same bus stop as the 19 & 20 buses. You can also take the 19 or 20 buses and get off at Kayano-chuo Gakko Mae stop.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Minō Koen"]}," 箕面公園 (",{"type":"''","value":["follow the signposts and hikers from the train station"]},").

During the fall, it is the arguably the best place in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Osaka"]]}," to see the changing leaves.\n\nAlong the path that leads to the waterfall, which is aprox 3 km long, (and uphill for the last half) there are a number of cute little shops that sell souvenirs (omiyage) and serve Momiji-tempura. Momiji-tempura is breaded & fried maple leaves. They are sweet and surprisingly delicious. They are only found in Minoo. \n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" There's also a small ",{"type":"'''","value":["insect museum"]}," about 20 mins up the path.

Many of these places are seasonal & some are not open in winter. \n\nAbout half way between the train station and the waterfall you will pass Ryuanji Temple. It is part of the Shugendo mountain worship religious sect and has a number of interesting buildings, some of which you can enter. \n\nThe park also has a number of other hiking trails for more serious hikers. Most of them lead to scenic overviews or into the hills beyond the waterfall.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:minomonkey.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["No ",{"type":"''","value":["omiyage"]}," for monkeys"]]},"\n\nThere are a number of things to do in Minoo. \n\nThe most popular place to go is up into Mino Park to visit the waterfall.\n\nIn 2011 an Ashiyu (foot onsen) opened next to Minoo Station. It is lovely. \n\nThere are also a number of regular hot springs you can visit as well. \n\nOn the path up to the waterfall you pass Minoh hotel - it features a large run-down and expensive onsen (hot-spring) resort.  There are many, much better Onsens in the area.  If you do decide to go, get ready to be nickel and dimed for everything.  The elevator up to the resort is 100 yen per person (but the view is worth it),  To use the Onsen, its 1300 yen for adults, 900 for kids.  Next, get ready to pay 50 yen for the locker for your shoes, then 100 yen for your clothing locker.  Then you get down to take the bath, and for all your money, there is no soap or shampoo!  Yep, you guessed it, get ready to shell out another 300 yen for soap.  Probably the biggest waste of money for taking an onsen in the entire Kansai region, if not the whole of western Japan.  Note:  The men's onsen requires walking down two flights of slippery stairs (while butt naked).  If you have disabilities that hinders movement you should avoid this onsen entirely.\n\nMino is also known for having the first Mister Doughnut shop. It is located in Minoo Station area and well worth a visit. \n\nYou can also take the 19 or 20 bus to Minoo VISOLA, a large and beautiful shopping mall. There is also a loop bus from the same stop.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\nThere are small shops along the path to Minō Waterfall, with most of the usual souvenirs - albeit with a few more plastic bugs than usual, owing to the insect museum. The other main themes in the shops are owls, monkeys & momiji. \n\nYou can also see a number of shops featuring red & white pottery that is only found in this area.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nThe local snack and souvenir specialty is small maple leaves slowly deep fried in batter. They are sweet and crunchy. They are usually sold in small bags or cups & generally more delicious when warm. \n\nThe area close to the waterfall has several shops selling a variety of food. If you are not interested in soba, udon or fish you should bring a sandwich or a picnic with you. Don't worry about bringing drinks... there are many vending machines along the path. \n\nThere are also two convenience stores in Minoo station. You can buy drinks, sandwiches & a number of other things to take with you. Beware though: the monkeys love plastic bags! If they're in the area they might come down and try to steal your lunch!! :)\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nMinoh beer is produced by microbreweries in Minoh. You will find it for sale at most of the shops on the street between the station and the entrance to the park.\n\nYou can buy beer and other drinks from the shops near the waterfall, but these are about twice the price you could buy them for at the convenience store near the station.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nTravelers may wish to look for accommodations elsewhere, as several major cities are within easy reach (see below).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Osaka"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kobe"]]}," are within easy reach on the Hankyu Line; it's also plausible to day-trip here from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kyoto"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["34.8333"],["135.4667"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Osaka (prefecture)"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Minoh, Osaka"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Minoh, Osaka"]]}]
