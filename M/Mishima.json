In line with this claim, water features feature proiminantly around the station front area to symbolise it. However, the harsh reality is that throughout the modernisation of the country, more and more industrial facilities have been placed upstream and their insatiable need for water has resulted in less and less actually reaching Mishima. Today, Mishima's prized park with its beautiful landscaped lake, ",{"type":"''","value":["Rakujuen"]}," (楽寿園), is little more than a sad, dry bed of craggy basalt.
