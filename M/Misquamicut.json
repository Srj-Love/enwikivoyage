The land was purchased from Chief Sosoa of the Montauks in 1894. The name was changed from Pleasant View to Misquamicut in 1928. In 1954, a massive hurricane and subsequent tidal flow destroyed what was once called Pleasant View, and the houses, shops and restaurants that were demolished were never rebuilt. The state of Rhode Island designated the 3\/4 mile beach a State Beach in 1959. Recent expansions of parking and a new state of the art waterless septic system show the states dedication to improving the conditions for both the tourist population as well as the ecosystem.   \n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\nMisquamicut Beach consists of the 3\/4 mile State Beach area, as well two Westerly Town beaches and a Misquamicut Fire District Beach. Subsequent private businesses own their own beach, and these are generally open to the public. All of the beaches come together to stretch for over 7 miles from the Western tip at Watch Hill, and the Eastern tip at Weekapaug Point.  This basin design allows for direct flow of Atlantic waves, and also allows beach-goers to have beautiful sunrises and sunsets. Off to the south from Misquamicut Beach you can see Block Island, Rhode Island some 11 miles away and on clear days to the southwest you can see the northern tip of Long Island, New York. Behind the State Beach there is a saltwater pond that stretches for four miles to the breachway near Weekapaug. Atlantic Avenue is the main thoroughfare that runs parallel to the beach. At each end there are two roads that allow visitors to get to the beach, one Weekapaug Road, near the eastern end, and the other is Winnipaug Road, which is near the western end of the State Beach, and right near all sorts of restaurants, hotels, bars and beaches.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Wildlife"]},"\nThe most important animal species to the area is the common Seagull. They dispose of visitors uneaten food and generally help to keep the ecosystem clean. Another important aspect are the dunes, which help to control the wind coming off of the water as well as prevent erosion of the already diminishing shoreline. A state referendum restricts any person to go onto the dunes at any time for they are fragile and impossible to replace. Along with the many species of fish such as tuna, bluefish and striper bass, there are also some larger animals that call Misquamicut home. Seals inhabit the waters in early spring, before heading north to Maine. Sunfish, a large 5'-6' fish, enter the waters in late July early August to eat Jellyfish who are also looking for warmer waters. Many whale sightings have occurred in the past few years, as well as sharks, however none have come close and none are interested in humans. The largest Great White Shark ever caught was caught off of Block Island.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nMisquamicut Beach enters their seasonal summer temperatures and weather in middle May, and the season closes in middle September. Temperatures are usually in the mid to high 70's until mid-July, when temperatures tend to stay in the 80's. This continues straight through until early September. There is relatively no humidity because of the strong westerly winds that blow from Watch Hill. Water temperatures stay relatively cold until late June, and by August they are very warm yet still refreshing.  Strong thunderstorms tend to form North of the beach and move South, however they move fast and rarely effect the coast for long. Wave heights are normally 2-3 feet, however this all depends on weather patterns and the tide. Misquamicut is no stranger to 10-20 foot waves in times of hurricanes and other storms.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nTake Interstate 95 to exit 1, and follow Rt. 3 towards Westerly until you reach Highway 78. Take 78 south until you reach Rt. 1, then cross over and continue down Airport road. Take the next left at the three way intersection, and continue straight through the next traffic signal. You will drive by small hotels and restaurants and take a left when you get to Atlantic Avenue in order to get to Misquamicut State Beach, or free lance and discover your own trail.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\nAll beaches require some sort of fee in order to access their beach, and the price for this access varies depending on weather and beach population. Generally the private lots are more expensive on holidays or if there is a large influx of visitors. There is no camping or fires allowed on any Rhode Island beach, also there is no tailgating allowed. Rhode Island beaches are alcohol free, please pick up all of your garbage please.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nExplore all of the available tourist attractions that are around Misquamicut including the beaches, bars, restaurants, hotels, mini-golf, go-karts, batting cages, water slides, arcades, and plenty of shopping destinations. There are three basic roads in Misquamicut, and they are important to understand. Main Atlantic Avenue and the two end roads of Winnipaug and Weekapaug.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Paddy's Beach and Bar"],["url=http:\/\/www.paddysbeach.com"],["email="],["address=159 Atlantic Avenue"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +1 401-596-2610"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=10am-2am"],["price=na"],["content=Local restaurant and bar with live music and great food.
