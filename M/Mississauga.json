Square One shopping centre contains the main local bus terminal for the city, it is regularly served by GO buses as well as local Mississauga Transit buses.\n\nGO Transit provides some commuter train and bus services which cross Mississauga to get to Toronto from Milton, Oakville and Hamilton. Commuter trains lead primarily to Toronto's Union Station, where it is possible to transfer to VIA Rail intercity services. Likewise, intercity bus service tends to be limited as most runs go not to Mississauga but to downtown Toronto.

Because of the lack of urban planning in its early years, the city has become too spread out, causing it to be difficult to traverse without a personal car.  Although the transit system is still used, the routes are somewhat infrequent (waiting times are typically 15 to 45 minutes on week days), and some bus routes are offered exclusively on week days.  In an effort to increase their number of passengers, Mississauga has put in major efforts to improve the system, including their Clicknride web page, which plans out the most appropriate trip for the rider as well.  As of 2012, a ride on a Mississauga Transit bus costs $3.25, and transfers (for free entry onto buses within the following one and a half hour since the beginning of the route) must be requested when you are paying.  Transfers can also be used for discounts on other public transportation systems in adjacent areas. \n\nThe transit system operates two types of services:\n\n",{"type":"''","value":["MiWay Local"]}," which can be recognized by the orange\/white bus livery. This operates like the old Mississauga Transit using most of the same routes with new routes being added as more areas of the city get developed. Also, the current fleet of buses are being replaced with newer hybrid-electric buses.\n\n",{"type":"''","value":["MiWay Express"]}," which can be recognized by the blue\/white bus livery. All express routes except Route 110 operate only during weekday morning and evening rush hours. These buses travel on expressways and major thoroughfares making a limited number of stops at designated bus stops. Buses are equipped with reading lights and power outlets at each seat. Route 110 runs throughout the day each day including weekends and holidays.\n\nA 12-station busway similar to Ottawa's transitway is being built along Highway 403 from Winston Churchill Boulevard to Renforth Drive via the City Centre. This will provide faster service for passengers by cutting commuting times by as much as half. The first phase of the bus rapid transit project is expected to be completed by early 2013.\n\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ttc.ca ",{"type":"'''","value":["Toronto Transit Commision"]}," (TTC)"]}," services some of the east end of the city near the Toronto boundary.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.oakvilletransit.com\/ Oakville Transit"]}]}," services some of the west end of the city near the Oakville boundary.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Blue & White Taxi"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Golden City Taxi"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:MississaugaPortCredit.jpg"],["thumb"],["Port Credit"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Port Credit"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat=43.55388"],["long=-79.58426"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=An older, historic village at the centre of Mississauga's Lake Ontario shore features many intimate small restaurants, cafes and bars.
