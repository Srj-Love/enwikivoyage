I-59 cuts across the southeast corner of the state connecting New Orleans to I-20 just west of Meridian.  I-59 and I-20 merge into one interstate at that point and head east until they split in Birmingham, AL.  I-10 runs the length of the Mississippi Gulf Coast.

State highways with 4 or more lanes are usually 65 miles per hour and slow down by 10 mph increments when they enter developed areas (usually no lower than 45 mph).  Typically, two-lane highways have a speed limit of 55 mph in rural areas.\n\nLike any other state, Mississippi has a mixture of four-lane divided highways and two-lane rural highways and state routes.  However, Mississippi does provide a respectable number of multi-lane highways.  Highway 49 is a 4-lane highway that connects the Gulf Coast to Jackson and crosses the Mississippi River at Helena.  Highway 98 connects I-55 and I-59 across the lower half of the state.  Highway 25 (state route) connects Jackson to Starkville (Mississippi State University).  Highway 82 runs east-west in the upper half of the state.  Pay attention to your maps and ask the workers on duty at the state welcome centers for help.  You might find a shorter route than if you stay on the interstates.
