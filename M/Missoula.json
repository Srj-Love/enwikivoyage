US Highway 12, which follows the Lewis and Clark trail on the west to and from Idaho, provides access to unspoiled wilderness areas and great scenery.\n\nBe advised that road conditions in Montana can be very hazardous in the winter, and if you are not accustomed to driving winding mountain roads or in extreme snow\/ice\/sleet\/hail\/rain conditions, you should exercise extra caution.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Camera A.J 583.jpg"],["thumb"],["350px"],["Overview of the Missoula city center"]]},"\n\nVisitors to Missoula often remark that the city is hard to get around in by car, a fact Missoulians famously owe to conflicting city engineers at the turn of the century.

The Kim Williams Trail, which follows the waterfront, is an easy way to appreciate the former.  Tubing, rafting, and canoe\/kayaking are also good options in the summer.\n\nMt. Sentinel, on the east side of town, offers a scenic trail system.  A trail starting at the University of Montana leads 700 feet up the mountainside to the “M,” which offers great views of the city.  More adventurous hikers may continue another 1400 feet to the peak of Mount Sentinel, which offers great views of the city, the Rattlesnake Wilderness to the north, and Mount Jumbo to the north.  Those with binoculars may perceive the ancient shoreline of Lake Missoula on Mount Jumbo, marking the edge of an enormous ice-age lake. One can also take the trail off the backside of Mt. Sentinel, which zig-zags down crossing the parasailing jeep road a few times to a sign which shows the lovely trail down thru forest on Sentinel's north side that ends at the old railroad tracks, now the Kim Williams hike\/bike trail, and then back to the parking lot at the \"M\" trails base. Doing the loop in reverse is also very pleasant.\n\nManmade scenic attractions include the Missoula carousel in Caras Park, the historic courthouse, a fine old train station (closed to the public) and several fine art galleries.  The Missoula Art Museum is also worth a visit.  Knowing that it could never outbid its big-city counterparts for works by famous artists, the museum has instead hosts regularly-rotated exhibits of Western art and works closely with community arts groups.  Furthermore, the price is right for visitors, as demonstrated by its slogan: ",{"type":"''","value":["Free Expression, Free Admission"]},".\n\nLastly, if you enjoy history both of Missoula's historic railroad stations still stand, preserved, and in use.  One, built by the Chicago, Milwaukee, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.american-rails.com\/milwaukee-road.html St. Paul & Pacific Railroad"]}," is currently used by the Boone & Crockett Club and the other built by the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.american-rails.com\/northern-pacific-railway.html Northern Pacific Railway"]}," is used as office space by local businesses and home of the Missoula Farmer's Market during the summer months.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nMissoulians enjoy a range of outdoor activities including hiking, rafting, \"tubing\", rock climbing, skiing, fishing, golfing, and just about any other activity that can be done outside.  It's no wonder—in Missoula you can take a city bus to within walking distance of federally designated wilderness area.  After hiking and returning to town, you can visit the historic downtown and enjoy some fantastic local food and drink.\n\nThere are a number of summer cultural events worth noting: the International Choral Festival, next scheduled for summer 2012, the River Roots Music Festival, Farmer's markets (three) every Saturday morning.  Music and food festivals at Caras Park (off Higgins on the banks of the Clark Fork) Wednesday lunches and Thursday evenings and the Western Montana Fair in August.\n\nSnowbowl, at 7,600 feet, is a great place to ski that is very affordable.\n\nYear-round 'First Friday' finds art galleries open to strolling passersby with music and food offered for free.\n\nThe public library on Main Street has special talks and presentations, about Montanan history, for example. There is also a movie 'Cheap date' night with popcorn and a drop-in Scrabble Club Monday evenings.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Acton Square Dance Center & Campground"],["url=http:\/\/www.lolocampndance.com\/"],["email="],["address=9955 Lolo Creek Road (Hwy 12) Lolo, MT 59847"],["lat=46.956"],["long=-114.175"],["directions=2.5 Miles west of Lolo on Hwy 12"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Campground and RV park.
