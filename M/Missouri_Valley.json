The Loess Hills are a large group of fine silt based soil found in few places. Due to the susceptibility of loess soil to erosion, loess can form large bluffs when sections break off. These can be seen throughout various parts of the hills. The bluffs in Missouri Valley Iowa and along Interstate 29 north of Council Bluffs Iowa display this phenomenon.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=I-29.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["directionl1=N"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sioux Falls"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Sioux City"]]}]}],["directionr1=S"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Omaha"]]}," via ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:I-80.svg"],["18px"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Council Bluffs"]]}],["image2=US 30.svg"],["imagesize2=22"],["directionl2=W"],["majorl2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Grand Island (Nebraska)"],["Grand Island"]]}],["minorl2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Blair (Nebraska)"],["Blair"]]}],["directionr2=E"],["majorr2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ames"]]}],["minorr2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Denison"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Southwest Iowa"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["41.558889"],["-95.893889"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Missouri Valley, Iowa"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North_America\/United_States\/Iowa\/Localities\/M\/Missouri_Valley\/"]]}]
