However, the Negev Highland – whose southern edge is Mitzpe Ramon – has occasional cool breezes that make the weather more bearable, although this is less common inside the crater. Additionally, the low humidity is a big advantage of these areas, making them feel sometimes no hotter than central Israel.\n\nRains are few in the area and occur only during winter. However, when they do, they can create flash floods in some of the streams, so travelers should be wary of them. The rest of the time, no water flows in the streams, and there aren't any natural sources of water inside the crater.

Additionally, the formation of the crater has unearthed some more ancient volcanic rocks in some places, creating dark, sharp hills that stand in beautiful contrast with the surrounding soft, yellowish ground. Also, the Ramon Mountain at the western edge of the crater, being 1033 meters above sea level, is the highest point in the Negev.\n\nFlora and fauna in the area is of the common species of the Israeli deserts. Animals include many ibexes (who frequent the town edges looking for food) and rock hyraxes, as well as the more rare foxes, jackals, wolves and hyenas. Some larger wildlife include the Asian and African wild asses; a very small number of leopards used to live in the area, but they have not been sighted in years.

More rare birds include a few types of vultures, found mainly in the northern cliffs.\n\nPlants in the area are mostly limited to small shrubs such as saltbush and capparis.

When dialing from elsewhere in Israel to Mitzpe Ramon, omit the country code 972 and dial 08 instead of just the last 7 digits. When dialing to numbers in any other area code, just replace the \"+972\" with \"0\"; for example, to call +972 50 1234567 (a cell phone number) from inside Israel, call 050 1234567.
