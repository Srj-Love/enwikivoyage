It has good diving and excellent beaches, local Okinawan cuisine, and culture.  These islands have truly embraced the Okinawan slow, relaxed lifestyle.  In Miyako you can do everything from lounge on Maehama beach, play beach volleyball, play golf, make your own shisa, listen to the sanshin, or, if you're feeling very competitive, participate in the local Strongman Triathlon, held every April.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nWhile most of the people in Miyako are friendly, Japanese is the main language, followed by the local hogen, or local dialects of each individual town as well as island.  While finding English speakers is possible, consider it rare.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nHirara has a fairly decent sized airport for such a small island, and there are flights daily to and from national Japanese locations such as Naha, Ishigaki, and more rarely mainland Japan, such as Osaka and Tokyo.\n\nAs of November 2008, there are no scheduled ferry services from outside the Miyako Islands.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe main island of Miyako, Miyako, is only about 81 square miles, but even so it's fairly sizable considering the main attractions for the island are on its outer edges.  Car, motorbikes, and bicycle rentals are available, as well as a periodic bus and numerous taxis.  Bridges connect Miyako to both Irabu and Kurema Islands, and a ferry travels to Irabu almost every half hour.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Itineraries"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nMaehama beach on the south west corner of the island is known as one of the most beautiful beaches in Japan for a reason.  White sandy beaches, warm, aqua blue, calm water, and an excellent view of Kurema Island are only a few reasons this is one of the top spots to get some sun.  Beach volleyball is an excellent way to spend some time at this excellent, flat, beach.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["drink"],["name=KIKUNOTSUYU SHUZO Co., Ltd."],["url=http:\/\/www.kikunotsuyu.co.jp\/english\/index.html"],["email="],["address=290 Nishizato, Hirara, Miyakojima-shi Okinawa 906-0012 JAPAN"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+81-980-72-2669"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nWhile theft does occasionally occur, it is not uncommon to see a business man sleeping on the side of Nishizato Street, his head on his wallet.  So long as travelers aren't foolish, there shouldn't be any problems here.  Travelers are more at risk in their rental cars, as people pull out into traffic with little warning, than anything else on the islands.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Okinawa"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Miyako Islands"]]}]
