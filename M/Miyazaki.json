There are also flights to Souel and Taipei through Asiana and EVA respectively. Airline pricing is highly variable, but the cheapest option to Miyazaki is usually the Solaseed ¥10,000 \"Visit Japan\" fare for travelers with a “Temporary Visitor” visa (the same requirement as the JR Pass) which is good for just about any single flight on the airline. Though, this is esentially a standby ticket, so you may have trouble during peak demand periods. Peak demand in Japan is around New Years, Golden Week (end of April\/start of May), and Obon in August, and of coarse, Friday and Sunday evenings are always more busy than weekdays.\n\nBuses connect the airport to the main Miyazaki station in 25 minutes (¥400), while the JR Miyazaki Airport Line runs 1-2 trains per hour to Minami-Miyazaki station (¥340).

You can take a single Shinkansen from Shin-Osaka to Kagoshima in 4.5-5 hours.\n\nAnouther option, the more scenic route, from Kokura station in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kitakyushu"]]},", the first stop in Kyushu on the San'yo Shinkansen, is to take the ",{"type":"''","value":["Sonic"]}," limited express to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oita"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beppu"]]}," and transfer to the ",{"type":"''","value":["Nichirin"]}," limited express (¥8300).

The Kyushu Shinkansen stops at Hakata; Hakata to Shin-Osaka (including Kokura) is owned by JR West, so you would need a JR West Pass for that section.\n\nStarting on March 12, 2011, a highway bus operated by JR Kyushu began to Miyazaki from the Shin-Yatsushiro bullet train station.

The Shusen-no-mori brewery makes (at time of writing) a Bock, a Koelsch, an Altbier and a blueberry-flavoured lager.
