The Gulf Stream, a powerful, warm ocean current, follows the coast line of Norway all the way north. The stream has a heavy influence on the climate, helping to keep the temperatures from getting too low in the winter, despite the city being located about 70 kilometres from the coast line. The distance from the coast does give it slightly lower temperatures than more coast-near areas in the winter, however. In the summer, the coast winds are often calm, heating the air. The weather can be very unpredictable, and change quickly. Blizzards can go on for hours, potentially creating traffic difficulties and cancelling flights. Because of Mo i Rana's latitude, summer days are very long and winter days are very short on daylight. In the winter season, the Northern Lights can be seen on the night sky. It varies in intensity, coloured from white green to deep red, and comes in different shapes, such as beams, arches and draperies. The 24-hr average temperature in July is 13.2 °C (56 °F), and the 24-hr average temperature in January is -6 °C(21 °F).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nTravel to Mo i Rana by train.
