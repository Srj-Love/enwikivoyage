At the time, it was surrounded by sprawling farmlands.  Over time, as the city grew, they began to build dams and canals throughout the neighboring foothills to help irrigate the farmland.  After World War II, suburban areas expanded, and Modesto was no exception: by 1980 the city had 100,000 people, and by 2000 it had 200,000.  The proximity to the bay area and relatively cheap real estate helped the city become a popular city for commuters to live in.\n\nToday, Modesto is one of a few large cities in the San Joaquin valley, and is home to a unique blend of bay area and farming cultures.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Modesto City–County Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["MOD"]]},"), ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name="],["url=http:\/\/www.modestogov.com\/pwd\/transportation\/airport\/"],["email=modairport@modestogov.com"],["address=617 Airport Way, Modesto.
