In fact the city is now safe enough for flights by Turkish Airlines. However, Mogadishu still remains very dangerous due to high petty and violent crime rates.

Since 1991, various Islamist and\/or clan or warlord-affiliated militias have had control over different parts of the city. A few months of relief were given in 2006 when the Union of Islamic courts took full control. Somalia was however invaded by Ethiopia just six months later and re-instated the western-backed Transitional Federal Government. The hard-line Islamist group Al-Shabab gradually took control over Mogadishu until the government only controlled a few square blocks. A counter-offensive, supported by large amounts of African Union troops cleared the city of militants in August 2011. Bombings and shootings are still commonplace but open warfare have for now ceased. A major shortage of food and thousands of refugees puts enormous stress on the few governmental offices that are able to function.\n\nThe book Black Hawk Down by Mark Bowden gives a detailed and a very accurate description of the lawlessness in Mogadishu during the early years of civil war.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\nFlights once again arrive at ",{"type":"'''","value":["Aden Adde International Airport"]}," just a few kilometers southwest of city centre, facilities are ",{"type":"''","value":["very"]}," basic, but the Turkish government has put up funds to renovate the airport and its security, control tower, and navigational systems.
