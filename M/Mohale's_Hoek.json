On the main street (near Nedbank and Fraser's Supermarket) is the delectable Rooster's. Rooster's is known for its fried chicken, pizza and meat pies. Service may be a bit slow but it'll allow you to take in the atmosphere.\n\nNear Moletsane Road, there is the formidable Mount Maloti Hotel. A \"quick\" lunch menu is available. Sandwiches, shakes, chips, pizza, and beverages galore are available in a cozy setting. You can even dine poolside if you wish! The more pricey buffet is another hotel option.\n\nJust off the corner of the bus-rank near the Mahe Hut, there is a cute local food shop called Two for Joy. Cheap \"plate\" food is available here for sit-in or take-away. The service is great and so are the makoena!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nThere are a number of drinking spots around town including the newly built \"Castle Rock\" where you can relax and enjoy Mhoek.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["-30.1500"],["27.4833"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Lesotho"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Mohale's Hoek"]]}]
