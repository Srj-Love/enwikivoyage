And test and experimental aircraft, like a Boeing B-52 comes out of the hangar to experiment. Edwards AFB is a famous air force base.\n\nThis Air force base was built in 1933 and opened for use in 1948 for the US Military and formerly NACA, and in 1958, NACA has been changed to NASA. And once Edwards is a NASA Base. It was once a NASA and Military Air Force Base. During the early history before Edwards Air Force Base, There was a water stop in 1876 at Southern Pacific Railroad, and was unsettled. And today, Edwards AFB is in it's space age, meaning that a lot of Space Shuttles have to land at Edwards AFB or the Kennedy Space Florida in Florida.\n\nThat is the only civilian getaway to enter the air force base, because it is on land, not by water. So, if you are driving from Rosamond, or driving on the Antelope Valley Freeway from Los Angeles, Mojave, or Palmdale, you shall take exit 55, and if from Palmdale, take a right, and if from Mojave, take a left. And leave Rosamond, and never take any turn and enter the base by a gate, and continue to enter the base. This is called the West Gate, If you are on Route 58, take Exit 186, then get on the road, and you will enter via the North Gate. South Gate is Lancaster but it is closed.\n\nThe main getaways to enter the base are Rosamond Blvd and the closed Lancaster Blvd entrance. There is also a housing area that is near, Edwards AFB, to get to there get on Lancaster Blvd, but not heading by the airfield. And get on Fitzgerald Blvd (named after John Fitzgerald Kennedy). And there will be a lot of houses in that area. Or, take left on Yeager Blvd, or Forbes Ave, or depending on which direction you are on Lancaster Blvd. And to get to air force base, take Yeager Blvd or Popson Ave.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Dryden Flight Research Center"]}," - During NACA, there was the Douglas Skyrocket in use. But not anymore, also it is the home to former Controlled Impact Demonstration, a December, 1984 project made by NASA. There was also Linear Aerospike SR-71 experiment in 1998 to test. And you can see Lunar Landing Research vehicle, which is still in today, only 5 built.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Air Force Rocket Research Laboratory"]}," - Home to the test rockets, they test rockets to research the rockets.\n\nThere are a lot of statues of military aircraft, such as the B-52 Fortress, or much more. Take a lot of pictures of these planes statues when you are driving or walking in Edwards AFB.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Rogers Lake"]}," - The lake that started all of Edwards AFB, in 1876 of the Southern Pacific Railroad, It is a water lake, but sometimes, you can be surprised that sometimes it is dry.
