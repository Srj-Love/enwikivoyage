The Preserve's unique ecology is attributed to its remarkable geology. The desert is a land of old mountain ranges, sand dunes, great mesas and volcanic features such as cinder cones, domes, and lava flows; these features contribute to the remarkable beauty of the landscape. The most ancient rocks in the preserve, found in the Clark Mountains, are 2.5 billion years old.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\nChanges in elevation and soil type, combined with dozens of seeps and springs, many in sheltered canyons, create a wide range of microhabitats that support a rich diversity of plants and animals. Some species are only found in this area. Notable plant assemblages include one of the largest and most dense Joshua tree forests, cactus gardens, and reelect plant communities of white fir and chaparral.\n\nSigns of animal life are subtle and easily overlooked. Birds and lizards are seen most frequently, but time of day, weather, and season all play a role in determining which animals are active.  A large percentage of desert animals are nocturnal: being active at night rather than during daylight hours allows them to avoid both high daytime temperatures and predators. Typical nocturnal animals include most desert rodents, bats, owls, mountain lion, skunks, and foxes. Other animals are crepuscular, active at dawn and dusk, and include coyotes, bighorn sheep and jackrabbits. Diurnal animals, those active during the day, are the most dynamic in that their activity periods will change based on temperature and season.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nThe weather is generally most comfortable in the spring and fall. Temperatures vary greatly by elevation. At low elevations, daytime highs are in the 70s in March; lows are in the 40s. Highs over 100 typically begin in May and can last into October. In the mountains, daytime highs are in the 70s in May; lows are in the 50s. Winters can bring freezing temperatures and occasional snows, with daytime highs in the 50s and 60s.\n\nAnnual precipitation ranges from 3.5 inches at lower elevations to nearly 10 inches in the mountains. Most rain falls between November and April; summer thunderstorms may bring sudden, heavy rainfall. The driest months are May and June.  Winds are a prominent feature of Mojave Desert weather. Strong winds occur in fall, late winter, and early spring months.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nThe nearest airports are in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ontario (California)"],["Ontario"]]}," (140 miles from the western boundary of the Preserve) and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Las Vegas"]]}," (60 miles from the eastern boundary of the Preserve).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nThe Preserve is easily reached via I-15 or I-40 east of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Barstow"]]},", and west of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Needles"]]}," and Las Vegas.
