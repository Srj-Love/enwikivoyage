Moline is one of the Quad Cities, along with neighboring East Moline and Rock Island in Illinois and the cities of Davenport and Bettendorf in Iowa. The corporate headquarters of Deere & Company is located in Moline, as is Quad City International Airport, Black Hawk College, and the Quad Cities campus of Western Illinois University. Moline is a retail hub for the Illinois Quad Cities, as Southpark Mall and numerous big-box shopping plazas are located in the city.\nIn the mid-1990s, the city undertook major efforts to revitalize its central business district, which had declined after suburban growth and retail changes after the 1950s and 1960s. Today, Moline's downtown again serves as one of the civic and recreational hubs of the Quad Cities; many events take place at the 12,000-seat i wireless Center (formerly known as The MARK of the Quad Cities) and at John Deere Commons.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Visitor information"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Quad City International Airport"],["url=http:\/\/www.visitquadcities.com\/"],["email="],["address=2200 69th Ave."],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 309 757-1773"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Staffed: M-Th 8AM-4:30PM; Doors to the visitor center remain open for accessibility to brochure racks, maps, and visitor guides when the airport is open"],["price="],["hoursextra=Volunteers may be available F-Su during daytime hours."],["content=The airport visitor center is located diagonally across from the gift shop, near the hanging monocoupe plane, and assists visitors and passengers with information about the airport as well as Quad City visitor information."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=RiverStation \/ Bass Street Landing"],["url=http:\/\/www.visitquadcities.com\/"],["email="],["address=1601 River Drive, Suite 110"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 309 277-0937"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=M-F 8:30AM-5PM, year-round"],["price="],["hoursextra=April-Oct Sa 9AM-4PM"],["content=A full-service visitor center and gift shop located on the John Deere Commons in downtown Moline.
