For the few people living in West Texas, the building of a transcontinental railroad through the area meant the arrival of civilization. In the summer of 1881, Texas and Pacific Railroad contracted with surveyor John Thomas Monahan, who discovered that the lack of water for the laying crew and their animals would slow down construction of the rail. Monahans' digging of a water well produced an abundance of good water (250,000 US gallons (950,000 L) a day) and was instrumental in the success of the city. Prior to this solution, water had to be hauled from the area of Big Spring, Texas.\n\nThe availability of cheap land encouraged settlers to form a small community on the track known as Monahans Well. However, when oil was discovered in the area in 1926, the destiny of the community changed directions. Oil discovery brought people of many occupations and of varied interests to Monahans. The local economy began to change from an agricultural to an industrial economy,\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nMonahans is most easily accessed via Interstate 20.  Midland International Airport is approximately a 45 minute drive away.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nA car is practically necessary for getting around Monahans, as well as the surrounding region.  While the town is small enough to walk around with relative ease, many attractions are at the edge of town and would be an unreasonably long walk from any lodgings.  As a rural community, public transit options are few.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Monahans Sandhills State Park"]]}," is one of the most famous landmarks of the region, featuring sand dunes atypical even of the mostly desert Permian Basin.

It offers good service and food, and is well-loved by locals.  Also worth a look is Super Burger, located near downtown on Sealy Street; it offers standard burger fare, but is built as a burger stand of the kind popular half a century ago and rarely seen today.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nA number of hotels can be found near I-20, some of which offer deluxe suites.  Travellers to the region should be advised that due to the extraordinarily booming economy of West Texas and the resulting influx of new people seeking work, a great number of people are actually living in hotels and it can be difficult to find a vacancy without reservation.  Additionally, prices for lodgings are considerably higher than in previous years.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Permian Basin"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Monahans, Texas"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["31.587777777778"],["-102.89055555556"]]}]
