This article contains general information useful in many destinations.\n\nThere are a number of ways to obtain and exchange ",{"type":"'''","value":["money"]}," while traveling. You are always trading off expense, risk, and convenience.  Unfortunately, organized and other criminals have developed numerous ways to take your money.  Credit cards have legal limits on how much you are liable if used illegally.  Debit and ATM cards have other risks\/benefits.  This article discusses how to use them, their risks, and how to obtain currency or cash.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Debit, credit and prepaid cards"]},"\n\nDebit\/ATM and credit cards can be used to withdraw cash from ",{"type":"'''","value":["automatic teller machines"]}," (ATMs) and to make purchases at stores, restaurants, and hotels where they are accepted.  Debit cards are sometimes known as \"check cards\" because they generates a withdrawal from an associated checking account when they are used. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Acceptance of debit and credit cards at point of sale"]},"\n\nThe acceptance of debit and credit cards varies by country, with acceptance generally being more common in more developed countries, and close to non-existent in non-developed countries. Check the country guides for details on credit card acceptance.\n\nBy far, the most accepted cards worldwide are VISA and MasterCard. American Express and Diners' Club cards have global networks but acceptance varies widely depending by country and merchant. Discover, JCB, China UnionPay, NYCE, Star, MAC, and Shazam are regional, not global, and are rarely accepted outside of the region they are issued in, and, even then, acceptance is often limited to areas catering to visitors from that region. However, Discover, JCB and China UnionPay have an alliance with each other, which allows any of these cards to be accepted on any of the other networks. Sales personnel may not be familiar with this, but it will work if you can convince them to try.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Acceptance of debit and credit cards at ATMs"]},"\n\nMastercard, VISA, Cirrus, and Plus are accepted at nearly all ATMs worldwide. As prompted while you use it, you \"identify\" yourself to the servicing banks for that machine and your account by entering a Personal Identification Number (PIN) after you have inserted your card and its data has been read. Because it makes so much possible, ",{"type":"'''","value":["never keep your PIN near or write it on the card it activates"]},".\n\nSome developing countries either have no ATMs, very limited ATMs, or are not connected to the international networks.  This includes ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Myanmar"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southeast Asia"]]},", as well as parts of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Africa"]]},". \n\nIn ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Japan"]]},", most bank ATMs don't work with international cards (the cards are even an incompatible size), so you'll need to look for a post office, 7\/11 or Citibank ATM. The preferred credit card type is JCB, though some businesses that specifically cater to foreign tourists will accept Visa, Mastercard or American Express.\n \nIn ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China"]]},", UnionPay is the preferred credit card type, although it isn't too hard to find a store or ATM that accepts more global types such as Visa or Mastercard.\n\nIn certain countries, not every ATM accepts foreign credit or debit cards. Do the necessary research in order to ensure that you have adequate cash during your travels.\n\n",{"type":"''","value":["When in an unfamiliar location and you have any choice, use an ATM in a bank lobby or highly public place"]},". This helps to avoid scanners\/cameras secretly installed by criminals, and it greatly reduces the risk that you might be robbed shortly after withdrawing cash.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Debit versus credit cards"]},"\n\nDebit cards are linked directly to a bank account and immediately deduct the amount of the purchase or withdrawal from the account. Credit cards are cards that are not linked to an account with funds in it, but instead charge against a credit line, which must be repaid at a later date. If the charges are not repaid before the end of a grace period (variably 0-25 days), interest will be charged...perhaps daily.\n\nATM-only cards (aka ATM cards) (often without a Visa or Mastercard logo) are intended only for use to withdraw cash at ATMs.  See \"Debit and ATM cards: Risks\/trade-offs\" below.\n\nWhen using an ATM to withdraw cash your bank may charge a cash advance fee of ~3% on top of foreign exchange and other transaction fees. In addition, most card issuers will start charging interest on your cash advance the day you withdraw from the ATM (i.e., they won't give you a grace period) unless you have a credit balance on your account. In addition, the interest rate for cash advances may be higher than for purchases. In some cases, cash advances are limited to an amount less than your overall credit line.  Sometimes these problems can be overcome by making a payment into your credit card so it has a credit balance, that you can then withdraw cash without incurring interest.  However, the banks liability in case of loss may be limited to your credit limit, so you may be taking a risk if you card is lost and abused, that your credit balance may lost.  This risk can also be minimised, by only transferring money into your credit account shortly before using the ATM to withdraw it.\n\nDespite the fees you or the merchant pays, when making point-of-sale purchases, it is usually better to use a credit card than a debit card.  If your card is stolen, your liability may be limited by law (for U.S. banks, $50 for all subsequent misuse), you can easily dispute the charges on a credit card, while a stolen debit card may lead to an overdrawn bank account requiring many additional hassles (again see \"Risks\/trade-offs...\" below).\n\nAs above, credit card companies will protect you if you are charged more than you agreed to pay, if you pay for something and never receive it, or if your card is ",{"type":"'''","value":["cloned"]}," (duplicated) without your knowledge and then used for fraud without being physically stolen.  You'll often receive a better exchange rate if you ",{"type":"''","value":["have the merchant charge the amount in local currency"]},".  That way, you receive the bank's exchange rate...usually substantially better than that offered by merchants.  \n\nCredit cards may also include other benefits such as cancellation insurance for flights (usually only in the case of serious sickness), theft or loss insurance for goods (usually only if stolen within 90 days of purchase and a proper police report is filed), collision insurance for rental cars, and emergency health insurance in certain situations while you are travelling.\n\nCredit cards may provide rewards programs that give you free flights or cash back after a certain amount of spending. The cards may be linked to a frequent flyer program.  If you have an American Express card, in case of a lost or stolen card, you can obtain cash advances and replacement cards easily, by visiting an American Express Office.\n\nThere are, however, merchants (particularly hotels and rental car firms) who abuse the privilege of a credit card client√®le. A hire car firm may attempt to rent you a vehicle with minor windscreen damage or small dents, for instance, then accuse you of causing the damage long after you return the vehicle. Repairs are then charged to your card at questionable or inflated prices. It can be much more difficult to get an uncooperative bank to process a chargeback if you are simply overcharged (or if there are hidden charges on your bill) than in a more clear-cut case such as a purchase where the product itself doesn't exist.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Traveling with debit and credit cards "]},"\nYour bank and experienced travelers regularly recommend that you:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Keep your card-issuing bank(s) advised about any travel"]},".

Acceptance of these \"Electronic Use Only\" debit cards for online purchases may not be guaranteed even with sufficient funds, and may need clarification with the issuing bank.  Consult the issuing bank about how to effectively use one.\n\nSome hotels and car rental companies put a \"hold\" on your credit card for a considerably larger amount than the amount of your charge.  A $100 car rental can render a card with a $3000 credit limit useless if the car rental agency puts a hold on an excess amount for the full $3000.  Keep track of these amounts, and try to make sure your credit limit is considerably in excess of the amount you intend to spend.\n\nHotels are often problematic for refusing to remove a \"hold\" even long after the client checks out, even though it can take weeks for an unneeded authorisation to expire on its own. Hotels who refuse cash, travellers cheques or any payment medium except a credit card are to be treated with caution; these do leave you open both to hidden charges and to holds which tie up your available limit unnecessarily. Cardlock (pay at the pump) fuel pumps will attempt authorisation for at least $75-100 even when a lesser amount of fuel is requested; this can be avoided by having the attendant process a transaction manually. Restaurants are also known to process authorizations (not charges, but a brief \"hold\" nonetheless) for more than the purchase price as their operators feel they are entitled to a (usually 15%) tip. All of this activity may cause valid transactions to fail on low-limit cards as the money is there but tied up with unjustified holds.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Debit and ATM cards: Risks\/trade-offs"]},"\nThe risks for debit versus ATM cards are somewhat different and at times much greater for debit cards.\n\nSome experts suggest that frequent travelers, and those who must use ATMs in less-desirable locations, consider obtaining and using an ATM card instead of a debit card.

This prepaid card works similarly to a VISA\/Mastercard debit card except that it is technically not a bank account.  Since it is not linked to your bank account, your maximum exposure is limited to the amount of money you transfer to the card.\n\nPrepaid cards may or may not be capable of being topped-up, depending on the issuer's policies .  In the case of the latter, it means that once the balance is completely depleted,  the card can't be used anymore and must be disposed of.  However for cards that may be topped-up, they can be done so in the issuing banks or online.  You do not need to have a bank account with the bank that issued the prepaid card but having one has advantages such as more convenient options to top-up your card (e.g. online, via ATM).  There is usually no minimum denominated amount for top-up.  With that, you can only top-up the amount you need for a certain number of transactions.   \n\nAvailability within each country varies.  Some countries like the US have prepaid VISA, Mastercard and American Express available at the counter of pharmacies or grocery stores; they just need activation at the purchase point.  Others will allow you to get them from well-known foreign exchange stands (e.g. Thomas Cook, Travelex).  But a few will only make these cards available directly from participating banks. \n\nGenerally, these prepaid cards can be used worldwide unless indicated otherwise (most notably, generic VISA, Mastercard and AMEX gift cards issued in the US).  However online use of prepaid cards depends on the issuer.  \n\nFees can be levied on the card purchase, on top-ups, on withdrawals, on non-use, and on closure.  The exchange rates used when converting to a different currency on the card, are ",{"type":"''","value":["not"]}," the standard VISA or Mastercard rates and are determined by the issuer.  These can easily be up to 10% from the midrate.\n\nPrepaid cards may or may not allow withdrawals from the ATM (depending on the issuer) and those that do may assess an additional fee on top of the usual fees imposed for withdrawals using a debit card since a prepaid card is supposed to encourage electronic POS transactions.\n\nIt will usually be cheaper to obtain and use a low foreign transaction fee debit card than a prepaid card for foreign currency transactions.  The only disadvantage being that you are subject to volatility in exchange rates, as your debit card only stores your local currency.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" EC Cards "]},"\nIf you have a European Euro bank account you will can obtain a ",{"type":"'''","value":["V Pay"]}," Card. This can be used as a debit card in shops and restaurants in other Euro countries with no additional charge. Can also be used at European (but not worldwide) ATM machines.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cheques"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Traveller's cheque"]},"\n\nA traveller's cheque is a cheque issued for a fixed amount in a specific currency that you purchase with your funds in advance.  Be sure to get the cheques in the currency of the country to which you are travelling, or (if that's not possible) whichever one gives the best exchange rate there. Traveller's cheques are available only in major currencies. For example, if you are travelling to the USA, you could purchase ten US$100 traveller's cheques before you travel there, and use them when you arrive.  You sign each cheque when you purchase it and again on the same cheque to redeem it.\n\nThe main advantage of traveller's cheques is complete protection against loss or theft.  Once you report them as missing, the issuing company will replace them.  ",{"type":"'''","value":["You must also keep a record of your used cheque numbers"]},".  Most traveller's cheque issuers have arrangements to replace them around the world in a short time frame so you are not long left without cash. If you are unsure which cheques you have already cashed and which are missing, your refund may be delayed until the issuer can figure out which ones have been presented.\n\nTraveller's cheques can be exchanged for cash at most banks.  Exchange bureaus will also usually cash them, and a hotel may sometimes provide this service to its guests.  American Express traveller's cheques can also be exchanged at American Express travel centres.  Fees for cashing traveller's cheques vary by destination and institution.  Some banks will cash some brands of cheques free.  American Express will cash their cheques free at their travel centres if they are in the denominated in local currency.  Often, fees apply, a sliding scale or a flat fee that may apply only above a certain threshold.  If you are cashing traveller's cheques into different currency to their denomination, fees may also be built into the exchange rate.\n\nTraveller's cheques are particularly useful in the United States and Canada, as the banks will cash cheques from major issuers (such as American Express) that are issued in the local currency without charge. As a result, almost all supermarkets, stores and tourist companies will accept them like cash. If you can purchase the cheques at a good rate they can be the best way of taking money to the US and Canada. \n\nTraveller's cheques can also sometimes be used for purchases at point of sale, although less widely than credit cards.  In general, only the largest stores and hotels will accept traveller's cheques for payment.\n\nYou will pay a fee to buy traveller's cheques.  If they are denominated in a foreign currency, this fee may be built into the exchange rate.\n\nIf you are buying traveller's cheques in a foreign currency, you lock in the exchange rate on the day you purchase the cheques.  Buying traveller's cheques prior to travel in small increments can sometimes have the effect of averaging out the exchange rate you obtain, and you don't have the risk involved in keeping foreign currency cash for extended periods.\n\nIf you have ",{"type":"[[","value":[["travel insurance"]]},", you may care to compare the benefits under your policy.  Credit card companies will usually offer a 48-hour emergency replacement or cash advance service for a fee, and these fees may already be covered under your policy.\n\nWhen you are visiting a developed country where your credit or debit card works, these electronic forms of payment are almost always better than traveller's cheques.  You won't have to find a bank or merchant that accepts the cheques (and bankers' hours are often inconvenient), and you won't have to guess in advance how much money you will need.  This avoids unnecessary fees if you guess too high and running out of money if you guess too low.\n\nTravellers cheques in a foreign currency may allow you to lock-in an exchange rate without the risk of cash, or the fees associated with a pre-paid card.  If you are travelling from Germany to the U.S. and know you are spending $1100 to stay at your New York hotel that accepts travellers cheques, you can purchase that value in advance with no risk of exchange movements at the time.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Personal cheques and manager's cheques"]},"\nA less widely-accepted cheque used for travel is the personal cheque issued by your bank.  Cheques are provided if you have a current account with your bank.  Should you run-out of cheques, you will need to pay a fee to reorder a new chequebook.  Acceptance is typically confined to the traveller's home country and in the home currency.  Another consideration is that you need to ensure that associated account is adequately funded otherwise it will result in hefty service fees, not to mention a possible blacklist on accepting cheques from you at the establishment's discretion.  That said, the main advantage of using a personal cheque is security.  As long you don't put \"CASH\" in the pay to the order of line, you shouldn't worry if the cheque is misplaced on either side; you can contact the bank to cancel the cheque and the one who gets a hold of the missing cheque can't cash it for himself.  Should you wish to use a cheque, make sure that you address it to the correct person or company (i.e. as much as possible, use their ",{"type":"'''","value":["complete"]}," names). \n\nManager's (or Cashier's) Cheques are cheques that are issued and purchased directly from a bank.  You need to fill-out some paperwork and there is a fee for every request.  You have to give your name, contact details and the name of the person or company who will receive your payment.  Unlike the personal cheque however, the manager's cheque is always adequately funded since you already paid it with cash at the issuing bank. In many ways, these are similar in use to postal money orders.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cash"]},"\n\nCash is the most versatile method there is.  Aside from some car rentals, airlines (while onboard), and a few gas stations, virtually everybody takes cash. \n\nIn some countries, you may be able to get by entirely with U.S. dollars or another major currency such as Euros.  However, this will often be at an additional expense as the exchange rate offered by merchants and hotels can be unfavorable.  Merchants in border communities may accept currencies of neighboring countries.  For example, northern border areas in the United States may accept Canadian coins on par with corresponding U.S. coins but not Canadian dollars, and, in the U.S. South, a Canadian quarter is usually worthless.  Macau practically accepts Hong Kong Dollars at a 1:1 basis with the Pataca and the difference is not noticeable for smaller transactions.  However exchanging Macau's money back into Hong Kong Dollars outside Macau is quite expensive if not impossible, even in Hong Kong.  Another example is Malaysia and Singapore where cross-border transportation-related charges on the Malaysian side are accepted in either currency at a 1:1 basis so it is greatly disadvantageous to use Singapore Dollars instead of Malaysian ringgit when for instance purchasing train tickets or paying for tolls.  \n\nFor remote travel, be sure to bring notes from your own currency only in ",{"type":"'''","value":["good condition"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["only the most recent redesign"]}," (unless it's ",{"type":"''","value":["really"]}," new).  Banks at your destination cannot easily or cheaply exchange worn-out currency for replacement as they can with their country's own currency.  Worn paper currency may be devalued--if it is accepted at all.  Even if in good condition, previous designs of your currency may not be accepted due to counterfeiting concerns. If possible, go to your bank early in the day, and well before the departure date, and ask for \"like-new\" currency.\n\nThe biggest disadvantage to cash is the risk.  If you lose it, you can't get it back, and if someone finds out you have a large wad of cash, you become a potential mark. Some defences are discussed in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["pickpockets"]]}," article, but there is no complete defence ‚Äî carrying cash always involves a risk.  ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Travel insurance"]]}," may cover a theft of cash to a certain value.\n\nWhen you use local money, familiarize yourself with the basic note designs and their security features (watermarks, holograms, etc), and watch out for counterfeits and obsolete currencies.  Banks and money changers (operating out of an office, not flashing wads of cash from a coat pocket) are nearly always safe, but taxi drivers and petty traders may be tempted to palm off useless notes.  When in doubt, reject unfamiliar notes. Also, be particularly suspicious of large notes, as they are more commonly faked.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Where to get or exchange cash"]},"\nIn many developed countries, the best option (given the convenience and typically good exchange rate) is to use an ATM in the destination country instead of bringing large amounts of cash to exchange.  There are modest fees, some fixed per transaction, others as a percent of the amount withdrawn.  The fixed fee(s) mean you should withdraw whatever substantial amount you may need for a few days in the area where that currency is used.  Occasionally, ATMs offer more than one currency, often driven by their location and customer base.  ATMs in developed countries may offer more than one language for use, also depending on customer base.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" You may be charged a fee to inquire about your balance from a foreign ATM (the charges for this are levied by the issuing bank). However, sometimes your balance will be printed out for free on a cash withdrawal receipt. With the various exchange rates and fees, the amount displayed on the screen may not be accurate. As such, the best way to check your balance will be to enable secure internet banking with your local bank before you travel, which is offered for free.

"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" If you travel very frequently, consider opening bank accounts with banks that have a worldwide presence such as HSBC and Citibank.  They offer accounts denominated in major currencies.  If you have a foreign currency account with such banks and withdraw from their cash machine abroad, you may face either no or reduced withdrawal\/inquiry fees.  Moreover, if you deposit a large amount of money with them, you can receive premium personalized assistance abroad with them by walking into their branches just as you would in a branch in your home country."]},"\nIn contrast, there are typically larger fees and or poorer currency rates (noted below) associated with currency exchange.  You should not exchange more than you need.  Money exchanges work on the basis of selling a foreign currency at one rate and buying at another. Make sure that you know the current interbank exchange rate before you leave home ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.xe.com\/ucc\/"]},". Where there is more competition, the rates are likely to be better.  \n\nThe most convenient location (such as at airports, malls or major hotels) can be the worst rates available for exchanges. If possible, check the difference (or spread) between \"we sell\" and \"we buy\". When this is more than 10%, you're definitely being ripped off. The best exchanges can go as low as 2%. Also, check if there is an additional commission for each transaction and its amount.  Exchange counters such as those associated with jewellery stores or pawn shops usually have fairly reasonable rates.  Exchanging foreign currency directly with banks is usually possible but some banks will only entertain you if you have large amounts.  In addition, some banks will require you to fill-out some paperwork and\/or show a valid ID.  Another disadvantage is that they mostly have limited operating hours so during weekends and holidays, you're out of luck.\n\nIn some cases it may be better to exchange your money before you leave, in others it may be better to do it in your destination.  As a general rule, the lesser-known currencies in the world have less favourable exchange rates abroad.  In fact, they may first be converted to a well-known currency like the USD before being converted back into the host currency also at unfavourable rates.  If this is the case, convert your home currency into a major currency (usually the USD) before leaving then exchange that major currency into the host currency when you arrive. \n\nMost major currencies are subject to counterfeiting these days.  Study the notes of the currency of the foreign country to become familiar with how it is supposed to look and feel.  Almost all currencies employ anti-counterfeiting technologies, including colour shifting ink, watermarks, special threads, iridescent inks, raised printing, holograms and other features.  Be familiar with them so that you can quickly check them when you get a new note whether it is as change or from a money exchange.  If you are unsure, don't be afraid to say that you would rather get a different note or say you would rather get two smaller notes for change. (For example, if you get a 10 in change that you don't like the look of, ask for two 5s instead).  If you end up with a counterfeit, you won't get compensated after you leave by whoever gave it to you, and you may end up having to explain it to the police.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Convertible currency"]},"\nA ",{"type":"'''","value":["convertible currency"]}," is a currency that can be easily converted into another country's currency; conversely, an ",{"type":"'''","value":["inconvertible currency"]}," is theoretically worthless outside its country of origin.  A few countries, like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cuba"]]},", still issue one convertible currency for tourists and one inconvertible currency for locals.  In some countries like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tunisia"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["India"]]},", importing or exporting (inconvertible) dinars and rupees is technically a crime, although such regulations are rarely enforced for small amounts. Still, ",{"type":"''","value":["find out"]}," the laws beforehand and ",{"type":"''","value":["follow them"]},".\n\nConvertibility is set by law and not always entirely reflected in reality: some currencies like the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["India"],["Indian"]]}," rupee are inconvertible in theory but fairly easy to trade in practice, while others like the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Swaziland"],["Swazi"]]}," lilangeni are fully convertible in theory but almost impossible to sell or buy in most of the world.\n\nDespite the name, inconvertible currencies can often be ",{"type":"''","value":["purchased"]}," at a discount outside the country of origin as people holding onto them want to get rid of them.  Finding somebody to ",{"type":"''","value":["buy"]}," them is more difficult.  Also note that state-run shops in some countries will also insist that tourists produce ",{"type":"'''","value":["certificates of exchange"]}," to prove that their money was obtained from a legitimate source like a local bank at the official (usually poor) exchange rate, and such certificates are also often required if you want to change back any unneeded money within the country.\n\nIf travelling to a country with an inconvertible currency or one that you can't, in practice, buy or sell in your home country, you should convert all your money to a major international currency before leaving the country. In general, the following currencies can be exchanged at banks anywhere in the world: U.S. dollar, euro, British pound, Japanese yen, Swiss franc, Australian dollar, and Canadian dollar.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Hard currency"]},"\nIn many poorer countries with inflationary, unstable, and\/or inconvertible currencies, a foreign hard currency may prove more useful than the local currency. Although its value fluctuates, the \"gold standard\" for currencies remains the ",{"type":"'''","value":["U.S. dollar"]},". It may be accepted as payment directly by locals, though not necessarily at a good exchange rate.  In fact several countries in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Caribbean"]]},", the Americas and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southeast Asia"]]}," use it as their ",{"type":"''","value":["de facto"]}," ‚Äì or even official ‚Äì currency.  The ",{"type":"'''","value":["euro"]}," is also increasingly well accepted, at least in regions with many European visitors, and small countries with economically powerful neighbours may also accept regional hard currencies (such as the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Thailand"],["Thai"]]}," baht in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Laos"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cambodia"]]},", the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Australia"]]},"n dollar, or sometimes the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Zealand"]]}," dollar in much of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oceania"]]},").\n\nIf neither your home or destination country uses a globally well-known currency, you should take the most often exchanged hard currency at your destination. For example, someone traveling from Singapore to Mexico should take U.S. dollars. Although this involves a double conversion, it will almost always prove to be cheaper than a single conversion (i.e. the exchange rate in Mexico for Singapore dollars is likely to be terrible). \n\nYou can also use hard currency when haggling with locals by offering hard instead of local currency. Use the conversion rate to your advantage and make an offer in hard currency. Showing a few U.S. dollars in the process might help but be sure to show only what you are willing to pay. Also, if you plan on haggling, be sure to have small notes available so you don't need much change back, especially if you just haggled a price much lower. You don't want to be giving a vendor 50 for an item worth 5; you'll be inviting the vendor to try to sell you more things or, even worse, let nearby pickpockets know how much you have. \n\nIt is wise to carry an emergency stash of hard currency separated from all your other belongings and valuables. Some businesses that deal with many foreign tourists may also accept foreign money but almost always at an inferior exchange rate to allow for the inconvenience.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Black market exchange"]},"\nIn some countries the official exchange rate is fixed at a completely unreasonable or unrealistic rate.  In these countries the ",{"type":"'''","value":["black market"]}," will provide a much more realistic evaluation of the currency's worth and is practically unavoidable.  For example, in 2007, the official exchange rate was 250 ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zimbabwe"]]}," dollars to the US dollar, while the black market rate reached 600,000.\n\nThat said, ",{"type":"'''","value":["the risks of black market exchange are legion"]},".  First and foremost, black market exchange is ",{"type":"'''","value":["illegal"]}," and both buyer and seller may face severe sanctions if caught: the seller may even be (or work with) a police officer out to trap tourists.  Second, the risk of ",{"type":"'''","value":["fraud"]}," is high: you may get obsolete banknotes, fake banknotes, less than the promised amount or nothing at all.  Consider carefully whether you need to exchange in the first place, as businesses in countries with basket-case currencies will often be more than happy to accept hard currency directly instead (although this, too, will often be illegal), and you may get all the local currency you need back as change.\n\nChange only a bit at one place and the rest elsewhere so that if you are scammed, it will be less of a loss.\n\nThe key guideline to successful black market transactions is to receive the money ",{"type":"''","value":["before you hand yours over"]},".  Count the notes, inspect the notes carefully, compare them to any you already have, and, ",{"type":"''","value":["only then"]},", surrender your own money to the vendor.  ",{"type":"''","value":["Do not"]}," allow them to take back the money they gave you, as this is where various sleight-of-hand tricks can be pulled to replace the legitimate bundle with something entirely different.\n\nIn countries where foreign exchange rates are reasonable, it is best to avoid the black market entirely: you risk losing all your money for little gain at most.\n\nAn exception may apply in countries such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nepal"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["India"]]}," where doing a legal exchange at a bank can involve wasting an hour or more but most hotels will change money for you instantly and fairly safely. The rate may not be much better, but the convenience is.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Coins"]},"\nYou can't exchange coins once you have left a country.  Exchange them before you leave, drop them in a charity box, or souvenir them.  Becoming familiar with coins and currency for your destination country and not mixing coins from various countries in your purse or pocket can save you collecting too many coins before you depart.  To avoid accumulating too many coins in the first place, use them as much as possible to pay (instead of notes) during cash transactions.  Some countries have coins that are relatively large in value (such as 5 ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Switzerland"],["Swiss"]]}," francs, 2 ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Canada"],["Canadian"]]}," dollars or 5 ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bosnia and Herzegovina"],["Bosnian"]]}," convertible marks), which are advisable to spend first. \n\nIn the USA you can find in many supermarkets a ",{"type":"[","value":["https:\/\/www.coinstar.com\/ Coinstar"]}," machine. This will take any small change and convert to an eCertificate for some stores or as a voucher to spend in the store you are in. There is a 10% charge on the spend in store voucher but this better than carrying a lot of coins back to your home country.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Exchange rates"]},"\nForeign currency exchange is similar to the stock market; however, large day-to-day changes in rates are uncommon. It is very important to know whether a given rate is the number of foreign units in your home currency or vice versa. Getting it backwards could be a ",{"type":"''","value":["very"]}," expensive mistake. This error is most likely to happen if the two currencies are within two or three fold of each other in value. \n\nThe best way to avoid any mix-up is to find out if one unit of currency at your destination is worth ",{"type":"''","value":["more"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["less"]}," than your home currency. For example, the British Pound is worth more than one US dollar, while the Japanese yen is worth far less than a US dollar. Currencies worth more should have a rate greater than one--use this a multiplier. Conversely, currencies worth less should begin with a decimal (for example: 0.2345)--use this a multiplier also. If you only have the rate in the other direction, the ",{"type":"'''","value":["reciprocal"]}," or ",{"type":"'''","value":["inverse"]}," key on a calculator (usually 1\/X) will change it back. For example, if you have the rate of 4.264 but know it's worth less than your home currency, the reciprocal key will switch it to 0.2345 again (approximately). As an error check, the two forms of the rate multiplied together should be closely equal to one (either 0.9999... or 1.0001... or similar).\n\nBoth forms of the exchange rate serve a purpose. Using the previous example, upon arrival, you'll receive 4.264 units of foreign currency for each unit of your home currency (less fees). On departure, you'll receive 0.2345 units of your home currency for each unit of left over foreign currency (again, less fees). Likewise, multiply by 0.2345 to convert foreign prices to your home currency.\n\nAt exchange counters, both a \"buy\" and a \"sell\" price for your home currency will be displayed. The closer these are to one another (called the \"spread\"), the better the deal. Less commonly exchanged currencies are likely to have a large spread, making it quite expensive to buy and sell. The most popular web sites for obtaining exchange rates and automatically converting prices in foreign currency are ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.xe.com xe.com"]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.oanda.com\/currency\/converter oanda.com"]},", and ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.mycurrencytransfer.com\/currency-converter mycurrencytransfer.com"]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Carrying money across national borders"]},"\nCountries track large movements of money across national borders.  This is mainly to help prevent money laundering and cash transfers to criminal syndicates. If you transfer money between international bank accounts, this is done automatically, but if you carry large amounts of money (typically more than $10,000 US, Euro, or similar hard currency) you will need to declare it. Don't forget monetary instruments such as traveller's checks count as well, and paying your taxes isn't exempt from these laws.\n\nThe rules about personal and business checks can be confusing. If you are carrying a cheque payable to yourself or traveling party for greater than the threshold amount, then you need to declare it. Mailing a cheque from abroad with the cheque drawn on a bank in the same country as the addressee typically doesn't need to be reported. What matters is if the funds are outside the country from the party being paid--not where you happen to be at the time. You can control your funds from abroad without reporting, but not import\/export. \n\nSome nations (mostly third world) have such a low import\/export limit in the country's ",{"type":"''","value":["home"]}," currency (but not US dollars, Euros, etc.), that these limits may represent pocket change. Often, this is due to local laws not having been updated for hyperinflation. However, in such cases, the currencies are generally not convertible abroad, and\/or the rules not always strictly enforced.\n\nSome countries, such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["India"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Korea"]]},", do not allow the country's home currency to be imported or exported at all. This means that you will have to bring all the money you need in US dollars (or Euros) and change it to the local currency when you arrive.

If the location is not a bank, you will have to go to one or a foreign money exchange to cash the cheques.  Be sure to bring a blank cheque from your checking account back home or at least know the routing and account number (the digits printed at the bottom of each check).  There is a one percent fee for issuing the traveller's cheques, and the total sum is NOT a cash advance on your American Express card. They will cash advance your credit card without further permission from you if there's a delay in cashing the check, though.
