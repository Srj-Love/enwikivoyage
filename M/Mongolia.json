Those walls later became known as the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Great Wall of China"]]},".\n\nXiognu history is controversial. Different historians attribute them to several quite different ethnic groups. Some claim Xong Nu is cognate to Hun Nu or even that these are basically the same group known as Huns centuries later in Europe, but both claims are contested.\n\nThere have been several Empires in Mongolia after the Xiognu.  For example, the A Tureg Empire around 650 AD, with its capital approximately 110 km north of Har Horin (Kharkhorum). There was also the Uighur Empire, with its capital Har Bulgas (Khar Bulgas or Xar Bulgas) near Har Horin. The Khitans who controlled North China around 1000 AD as the Liao Dynasty had an administrative centre (Har Bukh) 120 km to the northeast.

Chinggis Khan, as he is known in Mongolia, came to power and united the warring tribes under the Great Mongol Empire in 1206.  He was proclaimed Genghis Khan (Chingis Haan), meaning ruler of all Mongol tribes. The Mongolian Empire was extended all the way to eastern ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Europe"]]}," under Genghis Khan. His grandson, Kublai Khan, subsequently conquered much of China, to establish the Yuan Dynasty. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Marco Polo"]]}," travelled through much of the Mongol Empire in Kublai Khan's time. The Mongols were, however, driven back to the steppes by the Chinese Ming Dynasty under Emperor Hongwu. They were later conquered by the Manchurian-Chinese Emperors Kangxi and Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty.\n\nAn independent Mongol nation would only emerge again in 1924 but was not recognised by China until 1945, as the Chinese were forced to grant independence to Outer Mongolia by the Soviet Union, in exchange for Soviet assistance in fighting the Japanese invasion.  Thus, the historic region of Mongolia was split into two, with Outer Mongolia becoming the independent nation of Mongolia, while ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Inner Mongolia"]]}," remained a province of China. Since that time, Mongolia has had a close relationship with the Soviet Union (and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russia"]]}," after the breakup of the Soviet Union). Mongolia even replaced its traditional script with the Cyrillic alphabet. (The traditional script, however, continues to be used by ethnic Mongols in China). As Inner Mongolia was the more populated area before the partition, to this day the number of ethnic Mongols living in China outnumbers the population of Mongolia.\n\nFollowing independence, the Soviet Union installed a communist government in Mongolia. Following the fall of communism in Europe, Mongolia enacted democratic reforms, which resulted in the first democratic multiparty elections in 1990. The democratic reforms eventually culminated with the first peaceful transfer of power in 1996, when the incumbent Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party lost the elections, and handed over to the victorious Democratic Union.\n\n",{"type":"''","value":["The Secret History of the Mongols"]}," is one of the great recordings of Mongolian history.

According to Hugh Kemp, Qadag is the most likely candidate for authorship of ",{"type":"''","value":["Secret History of the Mongols"]},". He writes about the history of ancient Mongolia and connects the modern reality with the ancient world. Even though the book is about the history of Christianity in Mongolia, it paints a view of ancient Mongolia from the height of 21st century.  The \"History of Mongolia\" by B. Baabar is a good source for the Modern History of Mongolia.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["On the trail of Marco Polo"]]}," covers some travel through the Mongol Empire in the time of Genghis' grandson, Kublai Khan.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["People"]},"\nMongolia is more than twice as big as Texas and nearly the same size as Alaska. Its area is 1.6 million square kilometres (603,000 square miles), four times the size of Japan and almost double that of Eastern Europe.\n\nThis makes Mongolia the sixth-largest country in Asia and 19th in the world, but the population is only 2,727,966 (as of 9 Nov 2009), which makes Mongolia one of the least densely populated areas in Asia.\n\nIf you consider that 40% of the population lives in the capital city of Ulan Bator or Ulaanbaatar (\"UB\") that leaves lots of room for you to travel in the outback. Of course, Gobi is even less dense.\n\nAlmost another 40% of population are scattered all over Mongolia with their 56 million head of sheep, goats, cattle, horses and camels.

It is when Mongolia celebrates its \"three manly sports\": wrestling, horse racing, and archery by either watching the festivities in Ulaanbaatar or by following them on television or radio.\n\nMany other smaller Naadam festivals also take place in different aimags (provinces) throughout July, and these more intimate festivals may let you get much closer to the action.\n\nThe Naadam celebrations are said to have started with the rise of the Great Mongolian Empire. Chinggis (a.k.a. Genghis) Khan used them to keep his warriors strictly fit. After the fall of the empire, the contests were held during religious festivals, and since the communist revolution it was celebrated on its anniversary.\n\nLegend has it that a woman once dressed like man and won the wrestling competition. That is why the long-sleeved wrestling costumes, called \"zodog\", have open chests - to show that every participant is male. Wrestlers wear short trunks, \"shuudag\", and Mongolian boots, \"gutal\". The yellow stripes on tales of wrestlers' hats will indicate the number of times the wrestler became a champion in Naadam.\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["CNYdates"]]},"\nOnly Naadam gives official titles to the wrestlers. Mongolia wrestling tournaments have 9 or 10 rounds depending on the number of 512 or 1024 wrestlers registered for the competition that year. If the wrestler wins 5 rounds, he will be awarded title \"Nachin\" (bird), 6 rounds - Hartsaga (hawk), 7 rounds - Zaan (elephant), 8 rounds - Garuda (Eagle), 9 rounds - Arslan (lion) and 10 - Avarga (Titan).\n\nIn 2006, Zaan (Elephant) Sumyabazar won 9 rounds that made him Garuda but that year 1024 wrestlers had 10 rounds which he won all. This entitled him to Avarga. Or Arslan (Lion) must win 2 in a row to become Avarga (Titan). The titles are for life. If Avarga (Titan) keeps winning at Naadam more and more attributes will be added to his title.\n\nThere is no weight categories in Mongolian Wrestling tournaments but there is a time limit of 30 minutes, if the wrestlers can not overthrow each other, referees use lots for better position which often settles the match. One who falls or his body touches the ground loses the match.\n\nMongolia Wrestling matches are attended by seconds whose role is to assist their wrestlers in all matters and to encourage them to win by spanking on their butts. They also sing praise songs and titles to the leading wrestlers of both wings, west and east, after 5 and 7 rounds. The referees monitor the rules but the people and the fans are the final judges.

Lately the Bus situation is much better. Most cities and towns are referred to in two ways, their name or the name of the Aimag (province) or Soum (county). e.g.  Dornod or Dornod Aimag or Choybalsan (the actual city name). Most buses have their destination on a card in the front window.

In Ulaanbaatar, there are two bus stations, one on the west near the Dragon Shopping Center and one on the East near the Botanical Gardens. Both stations are on Peace Avenue on either side of the city. Multiple buses run between them. Get local to write directions.  For the large buses buy your tickets the day before.\n\nIn the Aimag centers, there will be service to Ulaanbaatar and to local soums (small county seats) and usually the next Aimag Center.  However, all locations may not be available at one location.  Ask for help from the locals.

They always say they will go \"now\" (\"odo\") but it's rarely true and you can wait hours before they really go.

Adopting the Mongolian style of sleeping outdoors is also an option - wrap yourself in wool blankets and then cover yourself with a Russian raincoat (essentially a tarp in the form of a trench coat), and simply plop yourself down on the ground.

There often isn't even roads connecting these towns. This pristine setting means that Mongolia has wide open spaces for experiencing the outdoors for those who want adventure. Traveling across this vast country is often an adventure in itself with tourists and adventures alike going by car, motorcycle, bike, horse, camel, or foot. Most often this means camping on the shore of a river or with a nomadic family or in small roadside hotels in provincial towns. Along the way or on one of the many wild rivers and nature preserves, there is great fishing, particularly fly fishing during the summer. Climbing the mountains in the west are popular as well as photographing the wildlife, flora, or the multitude of birds living or migrating through Mongolia.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Mongolia Canoeing"],["url=http:\/\/www.mongoliacanoeing.com\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=976-99826883"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=River Tours, Canoe down some of Mongolia's major rivers"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Visit Reindeer Herders"],["alt=Tsaatan Community"],["url=http:\/\/itgel.org\/"],["email="],["address=Tsagaannuup, Khovsgol"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=West of Khovsgol lake, From Moron drive WNW, Past the Airport, Go to Ylaan Uul and continue north.

Beef might also hit the menu occasionally. Here, about MNT2,000-4,000 will buy you a large platter heaped with fried noodles and slivers of mutton. On the side will be a large bottle of ketchup. A tasty and greasy dish served is khuushuur (huushoor), which is a fried dumpling stuffed with bits of mutton and onion. Three to four make a typical meal. Also, the ubiquitous buuz (booz) can be had at any canteen in town or the countryside. Buuz are similar to khuushuur in that they are big dumplings stuffed with mutton and onion, however they are steemed rather than fried. About 6 buuz cost MNT1,200-2,000 or USD1.00-1.60, and serves one.\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["boodog"]}," or goat\/marmot barbecue, is particularly worth experiencing. For about MNT15,000-20,000, a nomad will head out with his gun, shoot a marmot, and then cook it for you using hot stones in its skin without a pot. Along the same lines as ",{"type":"'''","value":["boodog"]}," is ",{"type":"'''","value":["khorkhog"]}," (made of mutton), which is prepared like so: build a fire; toss stones into fire until red hot; place water, hot stones, onions, potatoes, carrots, and, finally, mutton chops, into a large vacuum-sealed kettle; let the kettle simmer over a fire for 30-60 minutes; open kettle carefully, as the top will inevitably explode, sending hot juices flying everywhere; once the kettle is opened, and all injuries have been tended to, eat contents of kettle, including the salty broth. This cooking method makes mutton taste tender and juicy, like slow-roasted turkey. Ask your guide if he or she can arrange one (but only during summer).\n\nThe boodog is also made of other meat, usually goat, and is similar to the khorhog with one major difference:  the meat, vegetables, water and stones are cooked inside the skin of the animal.  They skin it very carefully, and then tie off the holes at the legs and back side, put the food and hot stones inside, tie off the throat, and let it cook for about 30 minutes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nThe national drink is called ",{"type":"''","value":["Airag"]},".

The alcohol content is less than that of beer, but can have noticeable effects. Be careful, if you aren't accustomed to drinking sour milk products the first time might give you diarrhea as your stomach gets accustomed to it.  This should only happen the first time though.  Once you've completed the ritual, your digestive system shouldn't complain again. There are numerous ways to describe the taste, from bile-like to a mixture of lemonade and sour cream.  The texture can also be offsetting to some people since it can be slightly gritty.  It is worth keeping in mind that Airag is milk and a source of nutrients.  After a day of riding it can actually be quite refreshing, once acquiring a taste for it.\n\nThe first thing you will be served every time you visit a ger will be milk tea, which is essentially a cup of boiled milk and water, sometimes with a couple pieces of tea leaf thrown in for good measure. You might want to build up your tolerance by drinking lots of milk in preparation for your stay because they don't drink much else, except perhaps boiled water if you specially request it during a longer stay. Also, most traditional nomadic foods such as dried yogurt and the like require acclimatization to milk as well. Cold drinks don't actually exist in the countryside (unless you intend to drink straight out of a river, generally not recommended).\n\nIf you are in Mongolia especially in the country side try their National Home Made Vodka. It's usually made from distilled yogurt or milk. It doesn't have any weird taste. After you have your first shot of the vodka you won't feel anything, but few minutes later it will get to your head. Most people in Mongolia usually drink this for medical reasons. First you heat up the vodka then put in a little bit of special oil which is also made from milk. Careful don't overheat it, you might get blind. Mongolians call their national vodka ",{"type":"''","value":["nermel areehk"]}," (\"distilled vodka\") or ",{"type":"''","value":["changa yum"]}," (\"tight stuff\").

There are a few nice guest houses in UB for less than USD10 per night (even as cheap as MNT3,000 if you're willing to share a room), but they are crowded during the tourist season and hard to get into.\n\nOut in the countryside, most of the hotels are rundown leftovers from the Soviet era.  A better option is tourist ",{"type":"''","value":["ger"]},", set up by various entrepreneurial locals. Staying at one of these costs about 5000 tugrik per person per night. They often include breakfast and dinner as well. When staying in one of these guest ger, the usual gift-giving customs can be skipped.\n\nFinally, there are also ",{"type":"'''","value":["ger-camps"]},".

Anyone who is interested in teaching English will have no trouble getting employment and a work visa through a school or organization. However, the pay is generally low compared to other countries. Though it'll usually be just enough for room and board plus a little extra.\n\nLocal English-language media are another source of employment for native English speakers, offering work as editors, proof-readers or photojournalists.\n\nVolunteer work is available teaching English, assisting with charity work and joining archaeological digs. These jobs are easy to find and are very rewarding.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nApart from Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia is generally a safe place to travel. However, incidences of pick pocketing and bag slashing have been on the rise in recent years, so always keep your personal belongings in a safe place (money belts are highly recommended), especially in crowded areas or in places where your attention is diverted, such as internet cafes . Notorious places for theft are the Black Market (bazaar), the railway station and crowded bus stops.\n\nViolent crime is uncommon outside the capital city, but still caution is required at night, and dark or deserted alleys and streets, in particular, should be avoided.\n\nCorruption is a huge problem in Mongolia, and locals are convinced that the police are not to be trusted.\n\nThere are small bands of Mongolian ultra-nationalist thugs that style themselves as neo-Nazis and have assaulted foreigners including whites, blacks, and particularly Chinese. They are especially provoked by foreigner interaction with Mongolian women. They are mostly found in the capital, especially in the cheaper bars and night clubs.\n\nLone or female travelers obviously need to exercise a higher degree of awareness of their surroundings as getting groped in the chest or behind regions is not uncommon. Some actions like dancing close to a man will be seen as an open invitation as Mongolians generally don't dance this way.\n\nDogs in Mongolia can be aggressive and may run in packs. It is a good idea to be wary of them since they are not likely to be as tame as domestic dogs elsewhere. Most fenced yards and gers have a guard dog that is mostly all bark and no bite. Though, it is advised to make them aware of you as to not surprise it and to carry a rock in case it does charge you.\n\nManhole covers (or lack of a cover) is a surprisingly common cause of injuries among foreigners and (especially drunk) tourists. In smaller cities and outlying areas of the capital, there are a large number of missing or poorly placed covers.

If offered a plate of hospitality munchies, take at least a small nibble from something.
