Its history however, is long and rich and today it is a monumental little place. Some 74 buildings have gained national heritage site status, many in the centre.\n\nThe town received city rights in 1355, providing it with a number of benefits and the village quickly grew larger. Large fires destroyed most of the city in the late 15th and early 16th century, the last one leaving no more than 80 house intact. Nevertheless, the town was rebuild and flourished the rest of the 16th century, when the production of cheese and the smoking of fish brought economic wealth, together with the emerging shipyards. Since the current IJsselmeer was still a sea  (Zuiderzee) then, and it was connected to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Purmerend"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alkmaar"]]}," through rivers and lakes, Monnickendam could be easily reached by large vessels. Trade developed between the village and the countries around the Baltic Sea. Many of the historic buildings today have their origin in those prosperous times.\n\nLater, dams and dikes that were build to protect the region from the water, brought an end to Monnickendam's connection to outer sea and an area of economic downfall began. From those days on, like other towns in the region, cattle stock and the production of dairy became the town's primary activity. A canal was dug to allow so called \"tugboats\" to reach Amsterdam.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=VVV tourist information office"],["url=http:\/\/www.vvv-waterland.nl\/v_beheer\/print.asp?n_code=2067&print_type=35&lang=1"],["email="],["address=Zuideinde 2"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+31 299-820046"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=daily in summer, 10AM-5PM.
