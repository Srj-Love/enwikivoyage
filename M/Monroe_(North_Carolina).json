[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"],["pgname=Monroe"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Monroe"]}," is a small city in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Carolina"]]},". It is in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Union County (North Carolina)"],["Union County"]]},", on U.S. Highway 74. It has a close association with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Charlotte"]]},", which is about 30 minutes away by car.  Monroe's population is slightly under 27,000. Demographically, it has historically been populated by White and African-Americans; however, in recent years the city's Hispanic population has spiked dramatically. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nThough Monroe has a small airport, the vast majority of visitors will arrive there by car.  The primary artery through the city is US-74, though there are smaller roads connecting it to other nearby towns. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nCars are the only practical form of transportation in Monroe. There is no public transit.  Biking or walking is possible in some areas -- especially in the Historic Downtown -- but not recommended for visitors limiting themselves to the businesses and shopping found along the 74 corridor.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nMonroe still maintains its historic downtown, though it has seen better days.  The Union County Courthouse has an impressive bell tower, and is in a picturesque downtown district.  The stores along Main St. bear the feeling of a 1940s town, and are reasonably well preserved. Also, the original ",{"type":"'''","value":["Belk's Department Store"]}," can be found there. \n\nThere is a movie theater near the Monroe Mall on Highway 74. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nMonroe is not a tourist center, and there is relatively little for a visitor to do there besides shop.  The ",{"type":"'''","value":["Monroe Mall"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Union County Farmers' Market"]}," are probably your best bet aside from strolling through the downtown area.  High-school football games are also an event of interest for those looking for exposure to Southern culture.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nThe historic downtown of the city has some shopping, and is worth visiting for a casual afternoon. Of particular interest are a number of independently owned boutiques, The Renn's Nest, the antique stores, and the day spas; including Reflections (http:\/\/reflectionssalonspallc.com\/), and Emmy's, Mirage ( www.miragesalon-dayspa.com ) \npopulate the Historic Downtown. More businesses are be arriving soon. A full list of the historic downtown's businesses can be found at  ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.downtownmonroenc.org\/directories\/bus_directory.php"]},". \n\nMonroe's other shopping district can be found along the US-74 corridor.  The Monroe Mall offers some department store retail, and has a few interesting stores. Other bog box and chain retail stores can be found at Poplin Place.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nThe strip along US-74 has many chain restaurants.  If you are looking for chain food, there is no need to plan ahead; just drive down 74 and look for what you want. \n\nFor more personal dining, try exploring the historic downtown area.  There are a few good cafes to be found there and on surrounding streets. \n\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Blu Moon Cafe and Restaurant"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.blu-moon-cafe.com"],["email="],["address=232 E.
