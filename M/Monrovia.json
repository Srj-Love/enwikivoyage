The city, however, has a vibrant vibe on the street.\n\nTo be honest, there is not much to do, see, nor buy in the city center.  There are a number of merchants lining the streets, selling used clothes, household wares, and an \"interesting\" selection of DVDs.  There are two large, well-stocked supermarkets in the city center to offer a surprising selection of Western foods.\n\nStill, despite its woes, Liberia has the feeling of a country on the ascent.  Billboards line the streets, inviting citizens to pay their taxes to make their country stronger and to take pride in their success.  It is not cliché to say that Liberians are extremely friendly, so the streets seem alive and peepy.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nBrussels airlines offers flight from Brussels, Belgium, with a touchdown in Accra, Ghana.
