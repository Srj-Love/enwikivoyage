Within cities and settled areas you should find a good variety of the ubiquitous fast food drive thrus, homey cafes and diners, delis, steakhouses, Mexican cantinas, noodle and Asian grills and the odd Indian or Sushi restaurant.\n\nIn rural areas, however, your selection may be much more limited. Every small town will have at least one eatery, even if it's a cafe stuffed in the corner of a post office, or a burger joint in the back of the town bar. Quality will vary, of course, but the experience might stick with you. If you are looking for meat and potatoes, look no further than the local cafe, diner or steakhouse. The beef will be fresh, most often locally raised and slaughtered, and cooked however you want it -- but if you say well done, your server might cry.\n\nFor local flavor and distinctly Montana eateries, try the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.staggeringox.com Staggering Ox"]},", with locations in Billings, Helena and Missoula, or ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.mackenzieriverpizza.com MacKenzie River Pizza Co"]},", with locations in Billings, Bozeman, Helena, Great Falls, Missoula, Kalispell, Belgrade, Whitefish and Butte.

Try some chuckwagon food in and around the state like ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.westernromancecompany.com\/chuckwagonmeals.html Pappy's MT Catering"]}," and other quality businesses who cater for large groups and gatherings in Montana. \n\nBe sure to get a scoop of Wilcoxson's ice cream. This Montana company offers traditional favorites along with speciality flavors, like Moose Tracks. Their fudge bars, available at any convenience store, are a must-have.\n\nDuring the summer months, primarily late June, July and early August, look for huckleberries and famous Flathead cherries at farmers markets and roadside stands throughout Western Montana. If you're looking for adventure, ask a local a good place to go pick your own huckleberries -- but beware, they may keep it a closely guarded secret.  If you go, take some bear spray, they love the treat, too.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nMontanans, as a general rule, love their beer. Increasingly, Montanans love their microbrews, especially those brewed locally. Some famous microbrews are brewed in Montana, including Moose Drool, a brown ale brewed by ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.bigskybrew.com\/ Big Sky Brewing Co."]}," and the best selling microbrew outside and inside of the state. Microwbreweries in Missoula, Kalispell, Helena, Billings and other cities and towns allow for cheap tasting and filling of a growler -- usually the best bang (or buzz) for your buck.  A list of breweries can be found at ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/visitmt.com\/experiences\/food_and_beverage\/breweries\/ VisitMT"]},".  In 2012 Montana had 18.2 craft breweries per 500,000 people making it the 3rd most micro breweries per capita in the country.\n\nOutside of microbrews, domestic favorites vary from Coors to Budweiser, with light varieties in between. Bars good for bar hopping can be found in the downtown districts of most cities, especially ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Missoula"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Billings"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bozeman"]]},", and they're generally a good gauge of local color and culture. Outside of large cities, most small towns have at least one bar, and they often serve food of varying quality. A general rule of thumb -- if the town has a post office (the Montanan's definition of a town in rural areas) then there should be a bar in which you can quench your thirst.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nMontana is safer than most when it comes to violent and personal crime, but the state still suffers from one of the highest highway and road death rates in the country. Long distance travel over great amounts of time resulting in fatigue, hazardous winter road conditions, distances from emergency services, and alcohol consumption frequently contribute to the high number of deaths on Montana's highways yearly. This is not to say it's unsafe to drive in Montana -- just beware. If you are unused to driving winding mountain roads or driving in extremely hazardous snow\/wind\/ice\/rain\/sleet conditions, do not do so. Wait for the weather to clear -- it may result in a good story, those 12 hours you spent at a truck stop with some friends waiting for a pass to clear.\n\nIf you do find yourself stranded in winter conditions, it's important to remember two things -- first, be prepared. Always carry water, snack foods, a small first aid kit including a space blanket and a cell phone, if possible, for emergencies.  Although there is cellphone coverage along most of the highways, it can be unreliable in places, especially the numerous mountain passes.  Many rural roads have no cellphone coverage, so don't rely on always having quick emergency communication.  Second, if you become stranded, stay in your car, turn on your hazard lights, and wait for help.\n\nThere is a lot of wildlife around the state, including deer, elk, moose, bears, buffalo, and coyotes.  Always remember that these are wild, and do not tolerate people with cameras getting close, much less trying to put their kid on the buffalo.  Most animals will avoid humans by our scent or noise, although beware of deer along the roads.  When camping, always keep food in your car, or hung from a tall tree.  Tents are like tissue paper to a hungry bear.\n\nOutside of environmental and road hazards, use common sense, and you should be fine.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Respect"]},"\nMontanans treasure their state, loving it for the recreational opportunities, wide open spaces, and the friendly nature of their neighbors. They, in general, welcome tourists and travellers, and will be glad to let you in on cool places to go, the best hike to take, or their favorite fishing hole. However, in South-Western Monatana, people tend to be slightly less tolerant of tourists, being very protective of their land. In addition, some Montanans are very proud of being 'rednecks,' and may be seen sporting 'redneck proud' T-Shirts, caps, or bumper stickers. This is not meant to be derogatory in any way, but is an expression of pride in Montana's rough and wild cultural heritage. \n\nBe advised, however, that any disrespect of land and nature will not be tolerated. When enjoying everything Montana has to offer, please respect the lands, waterways and wildlife by following common sense. Don't litter, pollute or otherwise upset the landscape any more than you must, and though it is a cliche, do not feed the wildlife.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nMontana is the only state that borders more than two Canadian provinces.
