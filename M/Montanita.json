The region is known for its combination of small tourist-friendly villages and towns, magnificent unspoiled beaches, world-class surfing and both island and mountain natural reserves. Over the years, a relaxed and multicultural atmosphere has evolved. \nA hidden treasure that did not even appear on the maps just a few years ago, the combination of perfect waves, golden sand, and tropical vegetation have slowly developed its reputation as a tropical paradise.  \n\nMontañita started as a beautiful beach with a few rustic houses of native fishermen and some surfers in tents. Over time it's grown to include vacation homes, hotels, rustic restaurants, bars and open air cafès, created by people seeking to escape the frantic life-style of Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city and main seaport. Montañita has its share of foreigners who fell in love with the place and settled down. They include Argentinians, Americans, Australians, Canadians, Germans, Jamaicans, and Russians as well as people from all over Europe. This village's colorful variety of street vendors, artisans, activities, and party nightlife provide a multicultural atmosphere that attracts the same variety in its visitors. \n\nThe layout of Montañita is a grid of small streets crowded with shops and restaurants. Most of the east-west roads have beach access. North of Montañita's little town is a small mountain often called \"the Point\" that separates its beach from Olon, Montañita's neighboring town. On this small mountain is a beautiful ocean overlook and the beaches of Olon.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe usual way to reach Montañita and the other villages in Manglaralto Parish is overland via the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ruta del Sol"]},", a beautiful coastal highway running along the Ecuadorian coast. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" From ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guayaquil"]]},": Direct lines from Guayaquil to Montañita by CLP are only operated at 05:30 and 13:00 (2010).
