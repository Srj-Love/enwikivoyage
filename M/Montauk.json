It is named after the Montaukett tribe that lived on the lands that now encompass Montauk. Urban legend tells of Captain Kidd burying treasure somewhere in Montauk around 1700. Montauk is also home to the oldest ranch in the United Sates, Deep Hallow Ranch.\n\nAt the point of the hamlet stands Montauk Point Lighthouse, the first lighthouse built in New York and fourth-oldest lighthouse in the United States.\n\nMontauk is home to the largest commercial and recreational fishing fleet in the state of New York.
