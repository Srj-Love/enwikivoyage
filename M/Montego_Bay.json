The first record of a Spanish settlement here shows it as Monterias. The Spaniards hunted the herds of wild hogs that used to roam the hills and produced and exported 'hog butter' or lard. The name Montego derives from the Spanish \"manteca\" meaning lard, and Montego Bay is shown on some ancient maps as Lard Bay.\n\nDue in part to its location on the island's north shore, Montego Bay has long since earned the title of 'tourist capital of Jamaica.'  It receives the bulk of international flights, and is home to Sangster International Airport, the larger of Jamaica's two main international airports.  It is a tourist destination known for its duty-free shopping, cruise line terminal, and the sheltered Doctor's Cave beach with clear turquoise waters, which is one of the most famous beaches on the island.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By air "]},"\nMontego Bay Sangster international airport is on the northwest part of the island.

The Montego Freeport terminal consists of five primary berths two of which are dedicated exclusively for cruise shipping. There is a telecommunications centre for cruise passengers (and crew), snack and refreshment stand.\n\nTransportation is available from the terminal building, supervised by the Jamaica Tourist Board, which also maintains a visitor information booth.  Montego Freeport is about 3km south of town. Taxis to downtown MoBay cost about US$10.

Montego Bay Metro now operates three routes: Greenwood to City Centre; Sandy Bay to City Centre; and Cambridge to City Centre.\n\nTaxis are readily available, but as with all cities be aware that some drivers will be less honest or reliable than others.  follow your instincts; never get into an unmarked car with someone who offers you a ride, and stick with taxi services you recognize.  Your hotel can suggest trustworthy drivers.\n\nAnother very common way of getting anywhere outside the vicinity of your hotel is by tour van.
