After the World War I, fighting for the Allied powers, it was absorbed into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, which later became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. Montenegro was also later part of various incarnations of Yugoslavia, until it regained its full independence from the federation of Serbia-Montenegro on the May 2006 referendum.

All of them are produced by the famous company \"Plantaže\", but there's also some home-made wines of high quality, like Crmničko wine.\n\n1L bottle of \"Vranac\" red wine will cost you from €8 to €15 in the bar or restaurant and it is well worth it!

You should also avoid areas where there is military activity.\n\nIn the resort towns such as Kotor, Budva, Sveti Stefan and Herceg Novi, beggars and pickpockets are not uncommon. As in many other European locations, beggars are part of organized crime groups. Do not give them money.  Doing so may also make you a target for more aggressive approaches.

People also usually prefer to sip their liquor instead of emptying it in \"bottoms-up\" style. Be careful, \"rakija\", a plum spirit (usually about 53% alcohol content), is stronger than expected, and will make you drunk fast!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Wi-Fi"]},"\n\nWi-Fi points in bars and cafeterias are available to customers, and most hotels offer Wi-Fi connection in common areas for their guests.
