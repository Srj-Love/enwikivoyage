It was originally the state capital of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["California"]]},", and has more historic buildings in its downtown than any other city west of Santa Fe. Today it is best known for its beautiful coastline, its world-class aquarium and from the many John Steinbeck novels set there, including Cannery Row and Tortilla Flat.\n\nRugged terrain and vicious Pacific currents made much of the California coast virtually unexplorable to European ships.  After a disastrous attempt to explore this new territory by sea, Spanish missionaries in Mexico launched a series of overland expeditions from San Diego. Monterey was established in 1770 by Father Junipero Serra and soon became a Spanish military base with a small fort or \"presidio\" located near a calm harbor that could provide shelter to supply ships.  The military presence eventually gave way to a thriving commercial trade that brought in many enterprising foreign merchants.\n\nOnce ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mexico"]]}," gained its independence from Spain, Monterey became the capital of Alta California under Mexican rule. From this era come many classic stories of flirtation, fashion, and politics in the Mexican colonial era. Lands once owned by the government began to come into private hands, and local families began to consolidate their property and power into business enterprises based on the ranches or \"ranchos,\" where they raised cattle or invented the famous Monterey Jack cheese.\n\nMonterey soon fell under American power in the Mexican-American War and remained the capital of the territory. A delegation of writers drafted the constitution which marked the entrance of the State of California into the United States of America. This era saw the mass northward migration of ambitious people in search of gold, which led to a near desertion of the town. Monterey soon recovered, however, and today is known for its magnificent natural beauty, world famous Aquarium, and temperate year-round climate.\n\nThe Monterey Peninsula has the largest population of sea otters on the California coast.  The abundance of marine wildlife visible from the shoreline is one of the primary attractions of the region.  Seals, sea lions, and sea otters are visible year-round, and migrating whales are commonly seen in the fall and spring months.\n\nAlvarado Street serves as downtown Monterey's \"main drag.\" It has superb restaurants, a selection of bars, and unique shops.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" State Highway 1 (the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pacific Coast Highway"]]},") runs through Monterey, providing access from the north ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Santa Cruz (California)"],["Santa Cruz"]]}," (50 minutes), and from the south along the world-famous Big Sur coast."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" From the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bay Area (California)"],["San Francisco Bay Area"]]},", take US 101 south through San Jose and Gilroy to State Highway 156, going west at Prunedale (inland of Monterey Bay, 9 miles north of Salinas). Go west 5 miles on State Highway 156 (a two-lane highway that often gets congested on touristy weekends) through Castroville, at which point State Highway 156 becomes a freeway and shortly thereafter merges with southbound Highway 1. Monterey is then 15 miles south along Highway 1."]},"\nIf heading to Cannery Row or the Aquarium, look for brown signs that advise which exit to take.

That route is extraordinarily scenic but also full of very tight turns and a lot of stretches that require patient, careful driving. From Morro Bay (on the Pacific Ocean, to the west of San Luis Obispo), the drive to Monterey through Big Sur takes, in good driving conditions, about a half hour longer than going via Salinas and US 101. But the Big Sur coastal route should be avoided if there is any chance of fog, or in darkness—it's just too twisty, with too many dropoffs, to be advisable for drivers unfamiliar with the route, in adverse driving conditions. In the winter rainy season, it is always wise to check to make sure that the Big Sur route is actually open to through traffic—occasionally, a rock slide will close the road for a short period.\n\nDespite Monterey's popularity, all of the above routes will require you to traverse a two-lane road section at some point: State Route 1 between just south of Watsonville and Castroville, State Route 156 between Prunedale and Castroville, State Route 68 between Salinas and Monterey, or State Route 1 from most of the way from Morro Bay up to Carmel. Unfortunately, because the  Monterey Peninsula is so popular with tourists, all of those roads are often busy with traffic, particularly on weekends, which means there is a higher risk of traffic delays and even of head-on crashes.

(The Aquarium has rescued and released back to the wild over 500 sea otters.) Feedings of the various tanks are scheduled throughout the day and are fascinating, particularly the Open Sea exhibit feeding at 11AM each morning, and feedings in the Kelp Forest exhibit during which a diver in full dive gear enters the exhibit's water, feeds the fish, and talks to the Aquarium's visitors from inside the exhibit.
