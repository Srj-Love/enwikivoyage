Today, the town of Monteriggioni is the principal center in the modern Comune of Monteriggioni which encompasses 19.49 square kilometers in the area around the town.  Distances from other major towns and cities are: ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Siena"]]}," 15 km; ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Volterra"]]}," - 39 km; ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Florence"]]}," 50 km; ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pisa"]]}," 157 km; ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lucca"]]}," - 123 km; ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Arezzo"]]}," - 121 km; ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rome"]]}," - 250 km\n\nExcept for some work done in the 16th century, very little work has been done to Monteriggioni's walls or buildings since they were first erected. So Monteriggioni's walls and the buildings that make up the town are the best preserved example of their kind in all of Italy, so it is not surprising that it attracts buses full of tourists, but also architects, and medieval historians and archaeologists.\n\nThe more or less circular walls with a total length of about 570 metres were built between 1213 and 1219, following the natural contours of the hill.  There are fourteen towers on square bases set at equi-distance, and two portals or gates. One gate, the Porta Fiorentina, opens toward Florence to the north, and the other, the Porta Romana, faces Rome to the south.  The main street within the walls connects the two gates in a more or less straight line.\n\nThe main piazza, the Piazza Roma, is dominated by a Romanesque church with a simple, plain facade. Other houses, some in the Renaissance-style, once owned by local nobles, gentry and wealthy merchants facing into the piazza. Off the main piazza smaller streets give way to public gardens fronted by the other houses and small businesses of the town. In more hostile times, these gardens provided vital sustenance when enemies gathered without.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Do "]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Wineries "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Casa Vinicola Bartali"],["url=http:\/\/www.bartalivini.it\/"],["email=bartali@bartalivini.it"],["address=Strada dell'Abate 3"],["lat=43.41486795209986"],["long=11.211140155792236"],["directions="],["phone=+39 0577 304049"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=08:00-12:00, 14:00-18:00"],["price="],["content=Producing wines and olive oil since 1927.
