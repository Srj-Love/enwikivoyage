The beaches are full of interesting but awkward steep angles due to the strength of the pounding surf. The ocean floor here drops off very steeply after only 20- 40 feet, making the undertow here very strong; only strong swimmers should venture out very far. This topography also provides some nice waves for surfing. There are lifeguards on duty during the weekend. Don't forget to bring some sandals as the sand is of the black volcanic variety. It is a stunning feature for the beauty of it, but it is too hot to walk on after 10am. The beach is 50 - 80 feet wide and stretches for miles. It is busiest(not crowded by any measure) on Sunday with mostly Guatemalans.

To put it plainly, there isn't much going on in Monterrico yet. The weekends-only night-life, internet cafe (1 only as of Nov. '08) and mangrove swamp is pretty much it. At times there is a lot of litter along the main street, but as the town grows more tourist-aware, the local businesses have a campaign of cleanliness, including new garbage cans in public. The beaches are mostly clean, and the hotels between the Dulce y Salado and the Eco Beach place generally keep it the best.  You can take a 2 hour boat tour of the mangrove swamp for $5.  The main road leads from the beach to the mangrove swamp dock and is a pleasant little 10 minute walk.  There are a few mosquitos at night and you will get bitten so bring repellent.  Some hotel rooms have mosquito netting covering the bed, but not all.  The waves at the beach have a short and dangerous break.\n\nThere is an internet cafe with 2 terminals on the main road along the beach, and they charge Q12 an hour.\n\nThere is a Spanish language school.\n\nHorses are available to ride on the beach.\n\nBaby turtle release is one of the most fun activities.  There are several places along the beach that collect eggs laid by sea turtles and when hatched, they will mass release all the turtles. Ask your hotel manager or locals for more information. Generally the laying and release season runs from June through March. \n\nAffluent Guatemalans drive their ATVs up and down the beach. So do the police. Be aware.\n\nMore affluent folk fly their single or twin propeller plane in for the weekend and often fly low along the beach.  There is a grassy landing strip along the main road, owned by the Aeroclub de Guatemala.  Helicopters also fly along the beach once in a while, usually the affluent folk touring  around before landing at their beach houses. If possible take an ATV ride along the beach, (west or east for about 10 Km) you will see some fascinating houses.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Learn"]},"\n\nProyecto Linguistico Spanish School ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/monterrico-guatemala.com\/spanish-school.htm "]}]},", Calle Principal, Monterrico Taxisco, Tel 619-8200, 691-7505, espanolenlaplaya@yahoo.com. 20 hours\/week USD 60 (+ accommodation USD 85).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Natural sponge (Luffa aegyptiaca) drying in Monterrico.jpg"],["thumb"],["Natural sponge (Luffa aegyptiaca) drying in Monterrico"]]},"\n\nNot much here in the way of local textiles as in other regions of Guatemala, but there are some local specialties worth noting; this region grows and dries massive loofas (they can be found drying hanging from most any surface in early November). There is also a profusion of coconuts here, so plentiful in fact that they sit in big piles at the base of trees scattered all over town, and local merchants gather them and put them in big coolers.
