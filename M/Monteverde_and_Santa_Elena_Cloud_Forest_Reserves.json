From the west (Tamarindo, Liberia, Nicoya), you take any bus going to San Jose, and ask to get off at La Irma for Monteverde.  You will be dropped off at a gas station at a crossroads. Cross the street to the road going up the hill and there will be a small bus stop for buses going up to Las Juntas and Monteverde.  Unfortunately, only 2 public buses per day go to Monteverde from La Irma, at 10am and 3pm. The afternoon buses can often be up to 30 minutes late.\n\nYou may also choose to get a rental car. The roads within Santa Elena are now paved, but only as far as the gas station.  The road to the reserve is not paved.  Renting a car is thus not such a bad idea. In the dry season there is no need for a 4WD. While the road up to Montverde is unsealed it is graded, with much non 4WD traffic daily.  In the wet season a 4WD would be the safer route, or at the very least a vehicle with ample ground clearance and that the spare tyre is in good condition - you may have to use it. \n\nThere are also private transportation companies that offer private transfers in a private vehicle. There are also shuttle services that charge around $29.00 per person from anywhere in the country.  Be aware that these are not private, and sometimes utilize window vans that are packed like sardines.\n\nBeware of pickpockets on the public bus.  Don't put your back pack in the overhead rack.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThere are several Taxi companies, and local bus services are going up and down the hill every 2 hours every day.
