Obey the speed signs, as you may encounter traffic police. \n\nAlternatively, you can fly from San Jos√© to the small airstrip at Tambor and then take a taxi.  Both Nature Air and Sansa have daily flights, which take around 30 minutes.  The cost of flying is much more expensive than using ground transportation, but if you are short on time, flying is the way to go.  Coming from Tamarindo or anywhere further north on the Nicoya Peninsula, there are shuttles available for the trip.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe town is very compact and walking is the best way to get around.
