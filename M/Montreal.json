A thriving Iroquoian town called Hochelaga was on the site of present-day Montreal when explorer Jacques Cartier first visited in 1535. A hundred years later, in 1642, the tiny town of Ville-Marie was founded as a catholic mission by Paul Chomedey, sieur de Maisonneuve. It soon became a centre of the fur trade. After its capture by the English in 1762, Montreal remained (until the 1970s) the most important city in Canada and was briefly capital of the province in the 1840s.\n\nProhibition on sales of alcohol in the United States during the 1920s and 1930s made Montreal a Mecca for cross-border fun seekers from nearby New England and New York. The city built up a seedy, yet playful, industry in alcohol, burlesque, and other vices. In the 1960s, an urban renewal drive centred around Expo 67. The World's Fair in Montreal brought a subway system and a number of attractive urban parks and is considered to be one of the most successful World Fairs. Over 50 million visitors gathered to Montreal during this memorable summer. The 1976 Olympics left a strikingly idiosyncratic stadium and many other urban improvements.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Jacques Cartier Bridge 2.JPG"],["thumb"],["200px"],["The Jacques Cartier Bridge connects Montreal Island to the south shore of the Saint Lawrence River."]]},"\n\nThe opening of the Saint Lawrence Seaway in 1959, though much lauded as an economic boom, spelled the beginning of the end for Montreal's economic dominance in Canada. Once the transition point between western railroads and eastern sea carriers, Montreal watched helplessly as some of this business moved farther west, up the now navigable Seaway, to ports in Ontario and on Lake Superior. The Quebec Sovereignty movement, which began to pick up steam in the 1960s, further chilled the atmosphere for Canada-wide businesses, many of which moved their headquarters to Toronto.\n\nFollowing an economic depression in the 1980s and 1990s, Montreal became more secure in its place in North America and the world. It remains a centre of culture, arts, computer technology, aerospace, the biotech industry, and media for all of Canada.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Orientation"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Montreal WV.png"],["thumb"],["200px"],["right"],["As the world sees Montreal - Assuming north is up"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:montreal rt.png"],["thumb"],["200px"],["right"],["As we see ourselves - Assuming north is up"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["It has been said that Montréal is the only city in the world where the sun \"rises in the south.\""]},"\n\nMontrealers use an unconventional compass, using the river and the mountain as cardinal points. When you are downtown, the St Lawrence River is “south” and Mount Royal is “north”; making the West Island and the East End correct in both their names and orientations. This tends to confuse visitors because the “East” End is really north and the “West” Island is south, and the St Lawrence River runs almost north-south at this location.\n\nMost local maps use this convention as do the highways around the city. For example, Autoroute 15 north actually runs northwest and Autoroute 40 east runs northeast.\n\nTo underscore this fact, a Montreal map will show that the \"south end\" of Victoria Bridge is in fact further north than the \"north end\".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Gay Montreal"]},"\nMontreal is an extremely inviting destination for gay and lesbian tourists.

Same-sex marriage is legal in Quebec (neither residency nor citizenship are required for a marriage license, but there is a three-week waiting period after you receive the licence) as well as in the rest of Canada.

From here, cyclists may take Lakeshore Boulevard and the Lachine Canal Bike Path (see Airport section above) to Old Montreal and the downtown core. \n\nThe Isle-aux-Tourtes Bridge on Autoroute 40 is not accessible by bicycle. \n\n",{"type":"====","value":["From the United States"]},"\n\nCyclists approaching Montreal from the South Shore to the south and east of Montreal may access the Island of Montreal a number of ways (See map: ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.parcjeandrapeau.com\/Portals\/0\/chemin_alternatif.gif"]},").\n\nThe surest (but not foolproof) way is using the sidewalk Jacques Cartier Bridge. When it is not closed for repairs, it is open year round and all day. A paved bike path along the shores of the Saint Lawrence River provides the most scenic approach to the bridge.\n\nAn equally popular route is from the Saint Lambert Locks (Ecluses Saint-Lambert) of the Saint Lawrence Seaway near the Victoria Bridge (Pont Victoria) east of Montreal. The bike drawbridge may be blocked by the entertaining spectacle of a ship passing through the seaway.  From here, cyclists take the Grand Prix racing track (Gilles-Villeneuve circuit) on Île Notre Dame to the Concord Bridge to Montreal. This route is closed sometimes for car racing events ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.parcjeandrapeau.com\/Default.aspx?tabid=78"]},". In this case, cyclists can take a circuitous detour down a gravel causeway dividing the seaway and river to the Estacade, an ice boom that crosses the river parallel to the Champlain Bridge to Nun's Island and eventually Montreal. A lesser known crossing involves one at the Sainte Catherine Locks (Ecluses Sainte-Catherine) at Saint Catherine south of Montreal. These bridges cross the seaway to the same causeway as the Saint Lambert locks. In this case, the road to the Estacade ice boom is paved.  These bike links from the South Shore are open from 15 April to 15 November, from 6:30AM to 10:00PM.\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.parcjeandrapeau.com\/ACTIVITEacuteS\/V%C3%A9loetpatin\/tabid\/252\/language\/en-CA\/Default.aspx"]},".\n\nThe Champlain Bridge, Mercier bridge, and Lafontaine Tunnel are definitely inaccessible to bicycles. These can be dangerous, even in a car. A bicycle path crossing the Mercier Bridge is under construction and is expected to be open by the Spring of 2012.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nMontreal has historically been divided into east and west by boulevard Saint-Laurent. Numbered addresses on streets that cross Saint-Laurent start there and increase in either direction; most addresses are given as \"rue ____ Ouest\" (west) or \"rue ____ Est\" (east). Many streets are named after Catholic saints and figures from local history, both well-known and obscure. Note that in Montreal street names, \"east\" and \"west\" refer to the direction parallel to the St. Lawrence River, and \"north\" and \"south\" refer to the direction perpendicular to the St. Lawrence River. Because the St. Lawrence River runs almost north-south near downtown Montreal, \"east\", \"west\", \"north\", and \"south\" are actually northeast, southwest, northwest and southeast respectively. Confusingly, most maps displayed in the city have \"Montreal north\" on top which can be confusing with a satellite navigation that uses pole north. Also, don't try to navigate by looking at the sun!\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["On foot"]},"\n\nWalking is a favoured way to get around the densely packed downtown and the narrow streets of Old Montreal, especially during the warmer months. However, beware during winter months, as sidewalks can be icy and extremely hazardous after winter snow and ice storms. Winter boots with good grip are essential for surviving pavements that have not been cleared. Beware also (as much as you can) of thawing ice falling from overhanging balconies and roofs. But you can always take the stairs down to Montreal's famous \"Underground City\" (",{"type":"''","value":["Montréal souterrain"]},"), called RÉSO ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.stm.info\/metro\/souterrain2006.pdf"]},", a network of pedestrian corridors connecting Métro (subway) ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.stm.info\/English\/metro\/a-mapmet.htm"]}," stations, shopping centres, and office complexes.  \n\nJaywalking is widespread and rarely punished. However, be aware that drivers will usually not stop or even slow down if a pedestrian steps out in front of them, even at marked crosswalks. At an intersection, however, a pedestrian will have right of passage before turning traffic and most drivers respect this. Despite Montreal drivers' poor reputation for aggressiveness, they generally respect pedestrians. \n\nRue Sainte-Catherine is Montreal's main commercial artery and busiest pedestrian thoroughfare. The \"Underground City\" and the Green Line (or line 1) of Montreal's Metro is easily accessible from all the major office complexes, shopping malls, department stores, and theatre complexes that line it. Smaller chain stores and restaurants also vie for valuable commercial space. Well-kept historic churches with green space provide quiet oasis and contrast with the giant neon signs of strip clubs. Major hotels generally can be found one or two blocks north and south of Saint Catherine in the downtown core. Bars, restaurants, and dance clubs cluster within a block of Sainte-Catherine around Crescent and Bishop, catering to a mostly English-speaking clientele. Rue Saint-Denis, farther east, and the Gay Village between Berri and de Lormier, even more to the east, are mostly French-speaking. McGill College Boulevard in the downtown core from Saine-Catherine offers an open view of Mount Royal to the north and an impressive view of the Place Ville-Marie skyscraper to the south. Keep your head up and beware of following the flow of the crowd on this street: throngs of pedestrians often walk across cross streets against red lights, risking life and limb.  \n\nRue Prince-Arthur, east of Saint-Laurent, is for pedestrians only. Another pedestrian-only locale is Montreal's Chinatown, situated on Rue de la Gauchtière Est between Saint-Urbain and Saint-Laurent. A good trick for navigating downtown Montreal is to remember that streets slope up toward Mount Royal, which is just north of downtown and easy to see from most locations. \n\nThe districts surrounding downtown Montreal are especially delightful on foot. To the south is Old Montreal (Le Vieux-Montréal) ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.vieux.montreal.qc.ca\/eng\/accueila.htm"]}," (its narrow streets and buildings dating from the 17th and 18th centuries really can make you feel like you're in Old Europe) and the Old Port (Le Vieux-Port) ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.oldportofmontreal.com\/"]},", a waterfront strolling park with exhibits and boat tours, is very popular with the locals. To the north, the Golden Square Mile and the McGill University Campus is wedged between Mount Royal and Sherbrooke Street on the southern slope of the mountain. Old Victorian mansions and townhouses can be found along the sloping streets, many now housing McGill University's offices and libraries. Just west of downtown is affluent Westmount, a perfect example of 19th-century English-style homes and gardens (inhabited to a great extent by English-speaking people) climbing the slopes of Mount Royal's western part (the higher you climb, the larger the old mansions). Just east and northeast of downtown are the mostly French-speaking Gay Village (Le Village Gai) and Plateau (Plateau Mont-Royal) districts. Street after street displays turn-of-the-19th-century row duplexes and triplexes, replete with famous Montreal outdoor staircases, overflowing front gardens (or snow-covered gables, depending on the time of year), and tiny shops tucked into every nook and cranny. For people who like to see a culture where it lives, Le Plateau is the place to wander about in. \n\nMount Royal (Mont-Royal) is also accessible from the urban core on foot. ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.lemontroyal.qc.ca\/en_index3.html"]},". Fit pedestrians can climb Rue Peel to the southern edge of the park. A series of renovated staircases will take you directly to the Chalet near the top of the mountain, with its classic view of the downtown core. A more leisurely climb to the top awaits those on Olmsted Road (6.5 km), a wide, gently sloping bike and foot path accessible from the Plateau in Parc Jeanne-Mance (also known as Fletcher's Field). Smaller foot paths serendipitously branch off from this road. A cross-country ski path also winds to the top in the wintertime. Mount Royal's park was designed by Frederick Olmsted, a landscape architect who lived from 1822 to 1903 and was also responsible for the design of Central Park in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New York City"]]}," and the Emerald Necklace in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boston"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nDriving (SAAQ ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.saaq.gouv.qc.ca\/"]},") in Montreal can be a challenge for many North American motorists. Although turning right on a red light is allowed across the rest of Quebec (except at intersections where a sign indicates this is not permitted), right turns on red are strictly prohibited on the island of Montreal. The stop lights at most of downtown intersections are located on the opposite side of the intersection, not at the actual stop line as in some of Europe.\n\nThe use of road salt to keep roads ice-free during severe winters takes its toll on the roadways, which are either heavily potholed or subject to perpetual construction. Downtown traffic is dense. Street parking can be difficult. Parking meters are in use seven days a week in most districts (9am-9pm Mon-Fri, 9am-6pm Sat, 1pm-6pm Sun), including statutory Holidays. The standard parking ticket cost is $52. Parking tickets may be appealed in court only by the owner of the car that was subject to the infraction, so if a rented car is ticketed, the person who rented may be unable to contest the charge. Car parking downtown is expensive at around $3 an hour at parking meters or $25 per day at commercial parking lots. Parking signs are all in French, and will describe a day and hour (based on 24h clock) along with conditions for parking. Many arterial roads prohibit parking on one side during rush hour, and vehicles are subject to $150 fine plus towing costs and other fees. Also be aware that Montreal does not paint curbs red next to fire hydrants, but it is still illegal to park there.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["Days of the week"],["lundi — Monday",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\nmardi — Tuesday",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\nmercredi — Wednesday",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\njeudi — Thursday",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\nvendredi — Friday",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\nsamedi — Saturday",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\ndimanche — Sunday"]]},"\n\nThere are also many private and public parking lots, and their prices vary widely. There may even be $15–$20 differences between two parking lots just a few blocks from each other. \n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["Sign Language"],["North — Nord",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\nEast — Est",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\nSouth — Sud",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\nWest — Ouest",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\nExit — Sortie",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\nBridge — Pont"]]},"\n\nDuring the winter months, heavy snowfalls are common. In the aftermath of a snowstorm, an intensively-prepared \"déneigement\" (snow removal) process begins with intimidatingly large snow plows and trucks clearing, chewing up, and transporting away the snow. If you leave your car parked on a street, pay close attention to any orange \"no parking\" signs that will appear on roads to be cleared. Tow trucks will sound a loud 2-tone horn siren just before clearing. This is an announcement that a street is about to be cleared and that all parked cars will be cited\/and or towed if they are not moved. For this reason it's important to be able to check your vehicle at least once daily after a snowfall. It is best to use indoor or underground parking if snow clearing is likely.\n\nMany downtown streets are one way, which can complicate getting around. If you see a sign at an intersection that has direction arrows in a green circle, that means those are the only directions you are allowed to turn. Left turns are allowed on a green light provided there are no other signs prohibiting. Visitors should be familiar with the ",{"type":"''","value":["flashing green"]}," light, which indicates a protected left-turn (priority), which is equivalent to a green arrow in other parts of the world. Some signals are green arrows that flash, this is the same meaning. Autoroutes (expressways or freeways) can be challenging for visitors, as most signs are French, but most symbols are the same as in English Canada and the United States.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bike"]},"\n\nCycling is the best way to visit the City, especially its central neighbourhoods like the Plateau Mont-Royal; it is a very popular mode of transportation once the coldest winter weather is over. The city is criss-crossed by 660 km of cycle paths, including some which cross the St. Lawrence onto the island of Montreal. By far the nicest path is the Lachine Canal path that stretches from Lachine, along Lac St-Louis, down to Old Montreal along the canal. You can cross over to the South Shore either on the Jacques Cartier Bridge, Île Notre-Dame, or via the Estacade ice bridge from Île des Sœurs.\n\nEven if you are on a bike path, beware of drivers especially if they are turning, as lines of visibility at intersections are not well enforced in the city. Generally Montreal drivers in the central neighbourhoods are used to sharing the road with bikes and so are courteous, there are always a few, usually from outlying neighbourhoods, who give all drivers a bad name. Some downtown bike paths are separated from the road by parked cars, which decreases visibility, both yours and the drivers. The often crowded bike path on rue Rachel one is the worst for this, however the Plateau part of the path will be renovated soon to make it safer and greener. If one is comfortable driving in Montreal, one generally can feel comfortable biking there as well. Montreal pedestrians are known for not waiting for a light to change if there are no cars coming; cyclists are a bit like that too and often treat the many stop signs on residential streets more as yield signs than as stop signs. Wearing a helmet is not required under the law, though, for children especially, it's better to be safe than sorry.\n\nThe ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/montreal.bixi.com\/home\/home-bixi Bixi system"]}," is a public bike share system. Rated the best in the world, it was designed and developed in Montreal and has since been exported to many cities around the world including London, UK and Sydney, Australia. Major credit cards are accepted. The Bixi was conceived for local active transit but is accessible to tourists as well. For a flat $7 fee, you can use Bixi bikes as much as you like for 24 hours provided you don't use a particular bixi bike for more than 30 minutes at a time before returning it to a docking station. After returning the bike to a docking station, you can get another bike (even at the same station) after a 2 minute waiting period. There are over 400 Bixi stations with over 5000 bikes around the city concentrated in the downtown and central neighbourhoods like the Plateau (though its expanding all the time). The tourist information centre has maps of the stations. Helmets are not provided nor are locks. You could use your own lock, but there is usually a station not more than a block away on a commercial strip so returning the Bixi to the nearest stand is always the safest and most cost-effective choice. Be aware that stations fill up and empty quickly; you may have to bike to the next station to find an empty docking spot. If you have a smart phone, there is an app that shows you real-time the nearest stations, how many bikes are docked, or whether there is a free docking spot available.\n\nSkate and bike rental shops are common, particularly in the Old Port and the Plateau.

",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/stm.info\/English\/tarification\/a-alacarte.htm"]},"\n\nTourist passes offer unlimited travel on the bus and metro for periods of one day ($9) or three days ($18) and are well worth it to avoid fumbling for change, checking transfer times and restrictions, and worrying about getting off at the wrong stop and having to repay. There is also an option for unlimited evenings ($5), valid between 6pm and 5am the next morning, which can be practical on a night out, since it's cheaper than buying a two-way ticket (which would cost $5.50). They are available for purchase at all metro stations (pay cash or use Canadian credit cards only). Weekly ($23.75, valid for one calendar week running Monday through Sunday) and monthly ($77.00, valid by calendar month) passes are also available; unlike one day and three day passes, weekly and monthly passes must be loaded onto an OPUS card (see below) and are not available in paper ticket form.\n\nThe OPUS card is a smart card with a chip that contains your fare and transfer information.

There are four interchange stations at which commuters can change subway lines without extra charge: Snowdon (blue\/orange), Lionel-Groulx (orange\/green), Berri-UQAM (green\/yellow\/orange), and Jean-Talon (orange\/blue).\n\nBicycles are permitted aboard metro trains outside of the rush hours such as: 10:00am to 3:00pm and 7:00pm to end of service on weekdays and all day Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. Bikes are only allowed in the lead car of the train up to a maximum of 6. STM staff may deny bikes aboard the metro for safety reasons such as special events that might generate a high level of ridership. Lists of such events are posted on the STM website and at the entrances to metro. During festival season in Montreal, bikes are seldom allowed at all.\n\nBike riding inside stations or the Underground City is strictly prohibited.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\nMontreal has a commuter train system run by the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.amt.qc.ca Agence métropolitaine de transport"]}]}," (AMT) with termini at the Montreal Central Station (Gare Central) and at Lucien-L'Allier (both are accessible from the metro). Commuter trains are handy for getting to suburbs and neighbouring towns.\n\nCommuter train stations are divided into six zones that radiate out from downtown. Stations have automated machines from which you must purchase a ticket appropriate to the zones of the station you are traveling to or from, whichever is farther (for example, a trip from Zone 1 to Zone 3 or vice versa would require a Zone 3 ticket). A prepurchased ticket card (SOLO) must be validated at the card scanners at the entrance to the platform. In general, reduced fares (for students and seniors) require ID that is not available to travelers, but if you are staying in the area, ask an employee for more details as the rules are complicated, but you can get good savings. \n\nThere are no ticket machines on the train and ticket inspections are random. Incorrect tickets sometimes go unnoticed because inspectors check only occasionally. However, it is best to avoid taking chances as if the ticket is not valid, the customer can get a fine of $400.

If you really want to discuss those topics with locals, be sure you are well-informed. It is still safer to avoid the subject, as it is still a very emotional issue. Use common sense and be respectful.\n\nThe first language in Quebec is French. Making an attempt to use the language is a great way to show respect for locals, whether or not they can speak English, even if you can manage only a few words with a very strong accent. However, it should be noted that Montreal is considered to be one of the world's most bilingual cities with many residents whose primary language is English. In case of doubt, you may want to open with a warm \"Bonjour!\" (",{"type":"''","value":["Good day"]},") and see what language is used in response. Most likely you will be answered in English, if your French accent does not sound local. Try not to be offended if you are trying to speak French and locals respond to you in English. Since most Montrealers speak both French and English, they are simply trying to make things easier for you.\n\nMany people working in the tourist and service industries are completely bilingual without accents. But don't make jokes about French people (especially since francophones in Montreal are mostly Québécois with a few Acadiens and Franco-Ontariens, all of whom consider themselves different from the French from France and from one another). Also, do not assume that all Québécois are francophones.
