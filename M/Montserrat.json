A large part of the island was evacuated as a result. There have been on-going volcanic eruptions in the southern half of the island since that time, and that part of the island (the exclusion zone) is now ash-strewn and inaccessible. \n\nThe northern half of the island is untouched, as beautiful as it ever was, green and lush; visiting it is perfectly safe. The active volcano (which can be viewed from a good distance) has become a tourist attraction in its own right. Montserrat is still well worth visiting, and the locals go out of their way to be encouraging and welcoming to tourists.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nColonisation dates to the 1600's; a gun battery was strategically placed at Carr’s Bay in 1624 to defend the island against approaching ships.  Montserrat was initially an agricultural economy; plantations and sugar mills were common in the 1700s with sugar cane juice and molasses processed for local consumption and export. Later, the well-to-do built their estate houses on the island; an elaborate main house was often a landmark because of its size and numerous rooms. In 1857 Joseph Sturge established the Montserrat Company, which cultivated lime fruit for export and sold small plots of land to settlers. Various old churches date to the late 19th or early 20th century. The first air charter flights on the island began in 1956; an eleven-hole golf course (now defunct) opened in the Belham River Valley in response to growth in tourism in the 1960s. A well-equipped recording studio, established by Beatles producer George Martin in 1979, attracted a long list of popular musicians in its one decade of operation. Tiny Montserrat promoted itself as \"the way the Caribbean used to be\".\n\nMore recently, Montserrat has been hit hard by the four elements, both from without and from within.  First the ",{"type":"''","value":["wind"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["waves"]}," of Hurricane Hugo swept through in 1989, damaging 90% of the island's structures.

Government offices have since been set up in Brades on the northwest shore of the island, out of harm's way.  Much of the island's population has returned, with estimates ranging from 4,700 to 9,500, compared to the pre-Hugo\/Soufrière high of over 12,000.
