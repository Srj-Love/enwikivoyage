Slow-scan television (SSTV) lunar transmissions must share communication bandwidth with telemetry data. Image data from the five Lunar Orbiter spacecraft is transmitted to Earth stations \"M\" (Madrid, Spain), \"W\" (Woomera, Australia) and \"G\" (Goldstone, California) and logged to tape. As real-time conversions from SSTV format for live broadcast on Earth were initially little more than primitive screenshots, by the time that July 21, 1969 moonwalk gets uploaded to YouTube substantial losses in image quality are visible. \n\nTransmission from lunar rover via a Command Service Module in lunar orbit to Earth is infeasible for visitors to the lunar poles or the dark side of the Moon, as line-of-sight transmission to Earth is simply not available. A 2008 NASA proposal advocates lunar-orbiting satellites as a workaround but no system has been deployed. \n\nA postmark exists for \"United States on the Moon\", a rare one-of-a-kind collector item.
