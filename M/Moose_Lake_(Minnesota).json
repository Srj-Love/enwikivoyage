The Moose Lake area attractions include the Famous 4th of July Parade and Old Fashioned 4th in the Park which includes a small town kids game area, crafters and food vendors. \nOn the 3rd Saturday in July Moose Lake hosts the annual Agate Days Celebration. This is a huge event featuring a Gem and mineral show that is absolutely spectacular. There is also the Agate Stampede in where a couple of truckloads of rocks and agates with a few hundred dollars of quarters mixed in, are all dumped down the Main Street in Moose Lake. Then at the sound of the starting gun, people scramble and literally attack these rocks looking for their hidden treasures.
