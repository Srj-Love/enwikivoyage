The Mordvin see themselves as two distinct nationalities, the Moksha and the Erzya, based on their related but distinct languages. The Moksha live primarily in the west of the republic; the Erzya in the north and northeast. Ethnic Russians, however, comprise the majority of Mordovia's population.\n\nMordovia is mostly flat, heavily forested, and dotted with lakes. The main rivers cutting through the region are the Sura and the Moksha.\n\nIn the first half of 1990s the level of social and economical development of the republic declined and by mid 1990s the livestock farming was in crisis. In the second half of 90s the situation began stabilizing, a part of plants adjusted to changing economic relations.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russian phrasebook"],["Russian"]]}," is spoken by all, although the lucky or persistent traveler might get to hear some Moksha or Erzya, both languages related to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Finnish phrasebook"],["Finnish"]]}," and in danger of becoming extinct.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nTrains arrive to Saransk from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]}," (through ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ryazan"]]},"), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ulyanovsk"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Penza (Russia)"],["Penza"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nizhny Novgorod"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kanash"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ulyanovsk"]]},".
