It serves government and many students attending school there. The central business district is very clean with plenty of places to eat and shop. Tourists are not as common here as some other areas of Mexico. You may want to load up on pesos before ordering food or trying to make a purchase, as foreign currency is not widely accepted. There are money changer stalls on the side streets off of the square.\n\nIt has a decent climate, nice parks to relax in, lots of places to get stuff, and very nice place over all. If you stay downtown, most of the attrations like the Cathederal, the square, museums, and shoppng, are all pretty much within walking distance. Due to Morelia's location, being a college town and center of State Government, tourist are not as common as some other areas of Mexico. The People are very friendly. In the central business district, drivers use their horns 24 hours a day to excess, prodding other drivers and to give notice at the numerous blind intersections. You will get used to it, but request a room away from the street.\n\nMorelia is more than just the Centro Historico. Its outlying areas feature modern housing developments, shopping centers and parks. Tres Marias and Bosque Monarcas are ultra-modern new cities adjacent to Morelia.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Día_de_los_Muertos_-_Morelia_MX_1.jpg‎"],["thumb"],["Casa de Artesanias - Morelia"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nDeluxe buses serve Morelia from all parts of the Republic, and Morelia's state-of-the-art bus station, located in the northern part of the city. The bus station consists of separate terminals for first-class and second-class buses. It is easy to reach Morelia from either Mexico City or Guadalajara. The bus trip from Guadalajara is about 3-1\/2 hours. From Mexico City, depending on the company, the trip can take up to six hours. You can also reach Morelia from the United States by way of Greyhound.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nMorelia is accessible by a modern toll road, and is located equidistant from Guadalajara and Mexico City.

An authorized taxi into the city in  2010 cost US$3.50 (2006) for up to 4 passengers and suitcases that fit inside the trunk. Going to the city center takes about a half hour.  Book the taxi within the terminal and take the ticket to the taxi area. \n\nThere are daily International flights from LAX, IAH and ORD and scheduled flights from SFO, SJC, SFM, which lead to MLM, Morelia's international airport, as do commuter flights from GDL, MEX, BJX and TIJ.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Morelia4.jpg"],["thumb"],["200px"],["Aqueducts running through downtown Morelia."]]},"\nBuses, combis and taxis form Morelia’s public transport.\n\nCombis are a good way to see the smaller roads and backstreets of the city. Various destinations are usually indicated on the windshield of these mini-vans. As of November 2011 a ride within the city costs 6 pesos. Get in, grab a handle and sit down before the driver speeds off, and then give your money directly to the driver, or to someone else to pass to the driver for you (you can ask the person “Si no le molesta, por favor”, basically, “thanks, if you don’t mind”). Above your head you will find a buzzer to get out at the next corner, or you can simply ask “en la próxima ezquina, por favor” (next corner please). It is very common for people to greet other passengers when boarding, according to the time of day (“Buenos días”, “buenas tardes” or “buenas noches”).\n\nTaxis are also plentiful and inexpensive, operating on zone fares. As elsewhere in Mexico, make sure to determine the price before getting into the taxi. \n\nDriving in the City is not easy, but with patience you can. Drivers use their horns to excess, to prod others and at the numerous blind intersections. The Centro Histórico is plagued by lack of parking. Driving in and around Morelia differs little from driving in any urban area. However, there is an “uno y uno” protocol in place. Drivers are actually quite respectful and obey this “one and one” rule, where — in stark contrast to Mexico City — at an intersection, you do not simply charge into any space larger than 5 cm, but fall into line, with one vehicule at a time from each direction driving through the intersection.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nThere are a lot of interesting and beautiful colonial buildings to see in ",{"type":"'''","value":["Morelia"]},", most of them are open to the public for at least part of the day.
