Poaching eggs or in any manner disturbing the turtles or their habitat is an offence punishable under Indian law.\n\nProtection of marine turtles and their habitat has been embraced by the local community through community-based conservation efforts. These efforts were commenced sometime in the years 1995-96 by a number of local villagers after discussions with Goa-based environmental protection groups. Before this time, the eggs were poached by fishermen, but later the fishermen became some of the fiercest protectors of marine turtles.\n\nThe Tourism Department of the Government of Goa has aided the conservation efforts by restricting temporary seasonal structures (e.g. shacks) to only a portion of the beach, and requiring them to operate only during daylight hours. Owners of the structures are also legally obliged not to leave beach furniture strewn about after daylight hours and not to do anything that would adversely affect marine turtle conservation.\n\nSadly in 2011 the turtles can hardly be seen anymore due to over-urbanization, light pollution and noise pollution."]]},"\n\nMorjim is a village situated in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Goa"]]}," in the Pernem district on the north bank of the Chapora River estuary.
