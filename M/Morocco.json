In the 6th century, northern Morocco became part of the Byzantine Empire. Throughout this time, however, the Berber inhabitants in the high mountains of the interior remained independent.\n\nIn 670 CE, the first Islamic conquest of the North African coastal plain took place under Uqba ibn Nafi, a general serving under the Umayyads.\n\nAccording to medieval legend, Idris Ibn Abdallah had fled to Morocco after the Abbasids' massacre of the tribes in Iraq. He convinced the Awraba tribes to break the allegiance to distant Abbasid caliphs in Baghdad and he founded the Idrisid Dynasty in 788. The Idrisids established Fes as their capital and Morocco became a centre of Muslim learning and major regional power. The Idrisids were ousted in 927 by the Fatimid Caliphate and their Miknasa allies. After Miknasa broke off relations with the Fatimids in 932, they were removed from power by the Maghrawa of Sijilmasa in 980.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Regions"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Regionlist"],["regionmap=Map of Morocco.png"],["regionmaptext=Map of Morocco"],["regionmapsize=350px"],["region1name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mediterranean Morocco"]]}],["region1color=#d5b66b"],["region1items="],["region1description=hosts all sorts of towns and cities, several ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Spain"],["Spanish"]]}," enclaves and some important ports"],["region2name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Atlantic Coast (Morocco)"],["North Atlantic Coast"]]}],["region2color=#d5dc76"],["region2items="],["region2description=the northern half of Morocco's coast is home to the capital and Casablanca, interspersed with more laid back beach towns"],["region3name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["South Atlantic Coast (Morocco)"],["South Atlantic Coast"]]}],["region3color=#4da9c4"],["region3items="],["region3description=the southern coast is more laid back, home to gorgeous beach towns like Essaouira and Agadir"],["region4name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["High Atlas"]]}],["region4color=#b383b3"],["region4items="],["region4description=covering the High Atlas mountains and the surrounding areas including Marrakech"],["region5name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Middle Atlas"]]}],["region5color=#71b37b"],["region5items="],["region5description=covering the Middle Atlas mountains and the surrounding areas including Fez and Meknes"],["region6name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saharan Morocco"]]}],["region6color=#d56d76"],["region6items="],["region6description=the vast desert region of Morocco runs along the border with Algeria; camel safaris and sand dunes are the name of the game here"],["region7name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Anti Atlas"]]}],["region7color=#a78379"],["region7items="],["region7description=the southern portion, covering Tarouddant down to the Western Sahara border"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["disclaimerbox"],["As travel conditions in the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Western Sahara"]]}]}," are remarkably different from a traveller's point of view, it is treated as its own entity.

When sharing grand taxi with others, drivers may cheat tourist-looking passengers charging higher—look how much locals around you pay; don't worry to ask other passengers about the normal price, before boarding or even when you're in.\n\nGrand taxis are usually a ~10-years-old Mercedes regular sedans that in Europe are used for up to 4 passengers plus driver. For grand taxi, it is normal to share a car between up to 6 passengers. Front seat is normally given to two women (as local women are not allowed to be in contact with a man, they rarely take rear seats). Travellers often pay for 2 seats that remain unoccupied to travel with more space inside, and hence comfort.\n\nGrand taxis can also be hired for approximately the price of two petit taxis for shorter trips. This is useful if your party is of four or more. Beware, some taxi drivers will refuse to drive off until the taxi is full, potentially causing you delays. Alternatively, for a relatively reasonable sum (depending on the driver), you can hire a grand taxi in Marrakech for the entire day, allowing you to explore the Ourika valley.\n\nTaxi owners vie with each other to add extras such as sunshades.

The two lane roads often become free-for-alls, up to the point at which you may see four cars wing to wing at a red light. One of the major hazards on the roads in Marrakech are the mobilettes. These pushbikes with an engine will zig-zag around you and generally make themselves a nuisance, however, on longer stretches of road, they tend to keep to the right. Often, a few beeps of the horn will cause a mobilette rider to pay a little more attention to his surroundings. However, be warned that some drivers pay absolutely no attention to your horn, as they have become so used to the sound. Drive defensively, and keep your speed down, so any accident causes minimum damage. Do not be intimidated by other drivers.

That said, like any country, Morocco has its share of problems, but they can be easily avoided should you follow common sense. Avoid dark alleys. Travel in a group whenever possible. Keep money and passports in a safety wallet or in a hotel safety deposit box. Keep backpacks and purses with you at all times. Make sure there is nothing important in outside or back pockets. There is some intolerance for public practise of non-Abrahamic religions and non-Sunni denominations.\n\nWomen especially will experience almost constant harassment if alone, but this is usually just cat-calls and (disturbingly) hisses.
