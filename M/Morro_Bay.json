A bayside walk completed in 2007 connects the Embarcadero waterfront to the ocean and harbor entry.

It is a great walking experience along a working port and eco-tourist destination. A variety of marine life is here, from sea otters to sea lions, and the town is a declared bird sanctuary. Excellent deep sea fishing originates at the north end of the Embarcadero. A public park and boat launch are at the south end. RVs and mobile homes may day-park at either end. There is a giant chess board in the middle of Embarcadero Rd.\n\nPopular surfing locations are to the north on easy access beach from free public parking and across the harbor entry to the north end of the sand spit that forms the west edge of the bay.\n\nOne can rent a kayak and explore the south part of the bay, which is one of the larger estuaries on the west coast. A favorite local tradition is to kayak from Morro Bay State Park or Embarcadero docks to the massive sand spit for a picnic.\n\nTo the north of town is the Morro Strand State beach which offers additional surfing possibilities and many locals with their dogs in a fairly open uncrowded setting. To the south of the town is Morro Bay State Park which includes an impressive public golf course set in pines on challenging hillsides with amazing views to the ocean and bay. A newly renovated public campground is available.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nShops cater to the tourist trade with art, t-shirts and the like.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nDorn's Original Breaker's Cafe (801 Market Ave.), right above the Embarcadero, has great views, and is both a popular and reliable choice, especially for older patrons.\n\nThe Outrigger Restaurant (833 Embarcadero) makes for a great dining experience and plays host to many out-of-towners as well as locals.\n\nDelicious French dip sandwiches are hand-carved in front of you at the Hofbrau restaurant (901 Embarcadero), which serves up German fare as well as the popular waterfront fish and chips and clam chowder options.\n\nFor an amazing carne asada burrito and authentic experience, head to Taco de Mexico (980 Main Street) for lunch.  Referred to by locals simply as \"Tacos De,\" this popular spot is easy, fast, and inexpensive, though lines can be out the door around noon.\n\nIf you are looking for an escape from the often tourist-filled Embarcadero dining scene, follow Main Street to North Morro Bay.  There you will find Lolo's Mexican restaurant (2848 Main Street), a great, family-friendly Mexican eatery with the best chips and salsa around (their salsa is bottled and sold in local grocery stores as well as in the restaurant).\n\nNearby and usually only open for dinners is the small, quirky, and charming Beach House Bistro (2770 Main St.), with a wide variety of gourmet fare, great specials, and awesome wait service.  Perfect for a romantic date after a day of surfing.\n\nFor additional waterfront dining, check out the Bayside Cafe (10 State Park Road), located at the local Marina.  Offering outside and inside seating and a view of kayakers, this restaurant is great for small family gatherings or long conversations with friends.  Try the catch of the day sandwich, which is almost always salmon cooked to perfection.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Twin Dolphin Inn"],["url=http:\/\/www.MorroBayHotels.com"],["email="],["address=590 Morro Ave"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 805-772-4483"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=$79"],["checkin=2PM"],["checkout=11AM"],["content=Located 1 block to the waterfront, restaurants and shopping.
