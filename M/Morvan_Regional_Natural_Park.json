The park was established in 1970 and comprises 117 member municipalities.

Since the last reclassification in 2008, the park covers an area of 290 900 ha, or 9% of the total area of Burgundy. It has 51,357 inhabitants (2006).\n\nThe Morvan has a rich ecosystem: a combination of forests, farmland, hedgerows and rivers. However, the biosphere is threatened by pollution, uprooting hedges (which are a haven for many species of animals) and damage to hardwood forests.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nThe establishment of the Morvan Regional Natural Park with 64 participating municipalities was ratified on October 16, 1970. In 1975 ",{"type":"'''","value":["Le Maison du Parc"]}," was established in Saint Brisson in a complex of buildings, including a castle and its outbuildings, built in 1802 and 1803 by an English architect. From here the park is managed. In addition to the administrative services the complex is home for the park's tourist office, a museum of the resistance in the Morvan during the second world war as well as a network of five houses forming the museum of the Morvan: ",{"type":"''","value":["la Maison des Hommes et des paysages"]},". In 1997 the number of participating municipalities expanded to 94 and in 2008 to 117. The main objective for the park is conservation, control and development of the natural landscape in which tourism is promoted with respect to the local equilibrium.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Morvan"]}," is a mountainous area that is actually an offshoot of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Massif Central"]},".

The ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mont Beuvray"]},", with its 821 meters and the excavated ancient Celtic town of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bibracte"]},", is among the high peaks. From north to south the Morvan has four areas: Lower Morvan (Bas-Morvan), Hill Morvan (Haut-Morvan Colliné), High Morvan (Haut-Morvan Montagnard) and the slightly undulating country of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Luzy"]]},". Especially the Haut-Morvan Montagnard is covered with large quantities of dense mixed forest interspersed with large meadow areas.\n\nThere are many water works in the Morvan, including reservoirs such as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Lac de Saint-Agnan"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Lac des Settons"]},". There are some rivers such as the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Yonne"]},", the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Arroux"]},", the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cousin"]}," and the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Auxois"]},". Because industry is lacking, there is little air pollution, so you see at the Milky Way during a cloudless night.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\nThe Morvan has a rich flora and fauna. In spring bloom primroses, orchids, figwort, wood anemones, wood sorrel, wild hyacinth, wild daffodil, parnassus, marsh lousewort, cow-wheat, stachys, etc. The spindle, honeysuckle, raspberry , blackberry (edible) and plenty of wild strawberry are widespread! Autumn is the ideal season for many species of mushrooms and fungi.\n\nBirds find a paradise: buzzards, hawks, falcons, harriers, kites, even the serpent eagle and osprey circling high in the sky in search of their prey... Many owl species can be found here. Rare birds such as hops, red partridge, kingfisher, dipper, crossbill, flycatcher, hawfinch and ortolan can be observed. To make birdwatchers more enthusiastic: buntings, all kinds of swallows, woodpeckers, chickadees, nuthatch, wren, common redstart, finches, goldfinches and of course culture birds as thrushes, sparrows, magpies, crows and jays are frequent.\n\nBig game such as deer, wild boars, foxes and badgers are very commonly observed. So are smaller species such as rabbits and hares, polecats, martens and weasels. Squirrels, muskrat, different types of mice, and the lesser known dormouse (a combination of a mouse and a squirrel) are anything but rare. At dusk the bats are massively active.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh =   6"],["febhigh =   8"],["marhigh =   11"],["aprhigh =   15"],["mayhigh =   19"],["junhigh =   22"],["julhigh =   25"],["aughigh =   24"],["sephigh =   21"],["octhigh =   16"],["novhigh =   10"],["dechigh =   6"],["janlow =   0"],["feblow =   1"],["marlow =   3"],["aprlow =   5"],["maylow =   8"],["junlow =   11"],["jullow =   1"],["auglow =   13"],["seplow =   11"],["octlow =   8"],["novlow =   3"],["declow =   1"],["janprecip = 54"],["febprecip = 50"],["marprecip = 49"],["aprprecip = 43"],["mayprecip = 75"],["junprecip = 63"],["julprecip = 47"],["augprecip = 55"],["sepprecip = 52"],["octprecip = 58"],["novprecip = 53"],["decprecip = 57"],["description = check ",{"type":"'''","value":["Avallon's 7 day forecast"]}," at ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.worldweatheronline.com\/Avallon-weather\/Bourgogne\/FR.aspx"]}]]},"\nThe climate in the Morvan depends on the height.
