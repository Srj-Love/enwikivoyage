The presence of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Washington State University"]}," in similarly college culture-intensive Pullman less than 10 miles (16 km) away only adds to that feel.\n\nMoscow is in the heart of a region known as the Palouse, noted for its rolling hills.

If you do need a car,  there are car rental services available at the Airport,  Budget (509)332-3511 and Hertz (509)332-4485, and in town (Ambassador Auto, 1-800-422-0297).

Bicycles are a common mode of travel in summer, but not in winter, due to the colder, wet weather. In the summer, it is very common for residents to bike-commute back and forth to work between Moscow and Pullman.
