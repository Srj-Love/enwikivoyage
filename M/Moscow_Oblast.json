These buses have a common trait of getting in jams in vicinity of the city. Two rules of thumb for determining where a jam will be (except traffic accident jams, where a navigator would help): most jams start from Moscow and ends at largest neighbouring cities, to the point that there wouldn't be a jam, if next cities are not so big or close. Secondly, time for jams is extended (with respect to what you'd think normally) rush hour. Malls add to jams on weekends as well. Skipping those jams with local trains may be tricky because of the distance between railways and highways. If you'd pursue this route, either check particular direction, or just go maximum of the route by train, and then most probably there'll be a connecting bus (if your destination is major, that is).
