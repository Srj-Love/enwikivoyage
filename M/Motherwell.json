The name Motherwell originates from an ancient religious well, the site now marked by a plaque on Ladywell Road. The name 'Moderwelt' appears on a map constructed by Timothy Port between 1583 and 1611, though at the time, it was only a hamlet.\n\nMotherwell is also famous for its reputation as a Steel production town, so much so that the town is given the nickname 'Steelopolis'. This is because of the nearby Ravenscraig Steelworks, which operated from 1954 until it was closed for good in 1992. Demolition and clean-up started in 1996 and remained as a brownfield site now being transformed into the nearby new settlement of Ravenscraig. The other steel plants in the town, at Dalzell and Clydebridge, remain open to this day.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Road"]},"\n\nMotherwell has ideal connections to the main central Scotland road network and beyond. The M74 from Carlisle to Glasgow appears at the south of the town, whilst the M8 from the two main Scottish settlements, Glasgow and Edinburgh, is approximately 3 miles away to the north, easily accessible by the A723, which travels from the town the Chapelhall, passing the M8 along the way.\n\nFuture indications appear to point to the creation of a dual carriageway, which would travel through Motherwell and neighbouring Ravenscraig, linking both the M8 and the M74. Many politicians see this as vital to the regeneration of the new Ravenscraig settlement.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Bus"]},"\n\nMotherwell is very easily accessible by bus, as many bus operators, mainly First Glasgow, travel through the town. First Glasgow regularly runs buses to settlements such as Airdrie, Coatbridge, East Kilbride, Glasgow, Hamilton and Lanark. Several other operators, such as Whitelaws and JMB Travel, regularly run coaches to nearby towns and villages. The three acute hospitals in Lanarkshire; Hairmyres, Monklands and Wishaw General, are easily accessible by bus. The busiest bus stops in the town are in or around Motherwell Town Centre.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Rail"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:MotherwellRailwayStation.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["250px"],["Motherwell railway station looking from the south."]]},"\nMotherwell has two railway stations; the main station, known as Motherwell, on Muir Street in the town centre, and Airbles Station on Airbles road. Motherwell station is considered one of the main railway stations in Scotland, as it lies on the West Coast Main Line running from Glasgow to London, via large cities such as Edinburgh and Newcastle upon Tyne. Many national train operators, such as Virgin Trains, East Coast, Cross Country and TransPennine Express, travel through the station, but not all will stop at this station. This station has 4 platforms, safe pedestrian walking over the railway lines, disabled access and on-screen arrivals and departures.\n\nThe smaller station is Airbles station, running on the Lanark to Dalmuir line via Hamilton Central and Glasgow Central Low Level. Connecting with the main station, this station is by far the least busiest of the two town railway stations, with trains ran by First Scotrail stopping there.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Airports"]},"\n\nMotherwell is ideally situated in the Central belt of Scotland, with easy motorway access to the two main airports. Motherwell lies approximately 16 miles away from Glasgow Airport and 31 miles away from Edinburgh Airport. Glasgow Airport can be easily accessed by the M74 which connects onto the M8 for the duration of the journey. Edinburgh Airport can be accessed via the M8.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThere are several pedestrianised areas and underpasses within Motherwell Town Centre, which can be useful for access to some of the main shopping streets\/areas, restaurants\/pubs and leisure facilities in the centre, as well as bus shelters, taxi ranks and the main railway station. Plenty of parking areas based within the town centre are available for those people who travel by car. There is also the Greenlink Cyclepath, a walkway\/cyclepath giving access from the town centre to the nearby Strathclyde Country Park. In future, this may extend into the new Ravenscraig settlement.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Strathclyde Park.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["250px"],["Strathclyde Loch, looking north."]]},"\nWith Motherwell being situated within a highly populated area of Scotland, as well as the largest settlement Glasgow, there is provision for the many people that are based in or within the town.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Strathclyde Country Park"],["url="],["address="],["lat=55.7975"],["long=-4.023056"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Formerly the mining village of Bothwellhaugh, much of this settlement has been drowned and replaced by a large loch with surrounding country to make present day Strathclyde Country Park.
