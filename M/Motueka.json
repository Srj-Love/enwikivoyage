On or just off the main street (SH60) are two large supermarkets; cafes, fast food chains, and restaurants; as well as gift shops, clothing shops and various other shops. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThe surrounding district has a large, but diminishing, number of orchards, as well as growing a variety of specialised crops such as hops and boysenberries (it was formerly the main centre of tobacco growing in New Zealand and some patches survive between police raids, growing for their \"own consumption\"). A number of small boutique wineries have gained an international reputation.\n\nNearby beaches (such as Kaiteriteri Beach and Marahau) are very popular with holidaymakers, and the area around Motueka has one of the country's highest annual sunshine-hour indices. Because of the gorgeous scenery and continual building of swanky clifftop homes by rich incomers, the coastline between Motueka and Marahau has been dubbed the ",{"type":"''","value":["Riviera of the South Island"]}," after the famous French Riviera.\n\nMotueka, as the nearest town to the Abel Tasman and Kahurangi National Parks, has become the base of many tourism ventures in those parks, as well as in other recreational areas. Extensive limestone cave systems (including Harwoods Hole in the Takaka Hill area north of Motueka) attract cavers and rock climbers. Sea kayaking and tramping now attract many thousands of visitors each year.\n\nMany artists and craftspeople live in the area around Motueka, especially potters and reggae musicians. The Riverside Community, in nearby Lower Moutere is a pacifist international community founded in the 1940s and now New Zealand's oldest co-operative commune.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nThe Abel Tasman Coachlines provide services between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nelson (New Zealand)"],["Nelson"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Richmond (New Zealand)"],["Richmond"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mapua"]]},", Tasman, Motueka, Kaiteriteri, and Marahau.
