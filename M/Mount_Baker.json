Long before white settlers came, Nooksack Indians called it quck-sman-ik, meaning \"white mountain.\" The Lummi Indians near Bellingham Bay called it kulshan, meaning \"broken off.\" Presumably, they were referring to the frequent volcanic activity.\n\nEnglish explorer Captain George Vancouver rededicated the mountain while charting the region in 1792. He named it for Lt. Joseph Baker, a young officer in his command who spotted the peak while their sloop \"Discovery\" was sailing off the coast of Washington, near Dungeness Bay.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nTemperatures in the Mt. Baker area range from 70s with clear skies in the summer to upper 20s with rain and snow through the winter. Annual rainfall in the lowlands is 30 to 50 inches. At higher elevations, precipitation ranges from 70 to 140 inches. \n\nIn 1999, Mt. Baker set the new world's record for the most snowfall ever measured in a single season-- 1,140 inches (2,895.6 centimeters)!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nTo get there from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bellingham (Washington)"]]},", take I-5 to exit 255, take Sunset Drive east until it becomes state highway 542, and follow that highway 56 miles to the ski area. This drive takes about 90 minutes in good weather conditions. The road is plowed regularly, so it should be passable to regular cars except during storms. Note, however, that chains may be required on two-wheel drive and all-wheel drive vehicles during inclement weather as determined by the Washington State Patrol.  Only vehicles over 10,000 gross vehicle weight rating must carry chains between November 1 and March 31.\n\nAnother popular route, for Canadians, is to take the Sumas border crossing, in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Abbotsford"]]},", and continue following the road signs as you drive southeast for 45 minutes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\nA Northwest forest pass is required to park at all trailheads and at the Artist Point parking lot.
