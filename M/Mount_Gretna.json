WWII diminished Mt Gretna’s popularity, with the closing its amusement park and the abandonment of its hotels.  Some traditions, however, remained.  The Playhouse Theater, the Jigger Shoppe, the Roller Rink, the Lake all remained.  And of course, the tradition of spending days and nights relaxing on the front porch of its many cabin-like homes.  In 1960 the Timber’s Restaurant was built, and in 1976 the very first annual Gretna Art Show took place, quoted as Mt Gretna modern revival.  The Playhouse and the Art Show give Mt Gretna its sense of identity and community.  \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=The Mt Gretna Lake and Beach"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=An afternoon at the Mt Gretna Lake and Beach is must.
