Designated as a national park in 1955, it has become a reserve for soaring falcons and sneaky dormice alike. The official climbing season is from July 1st until October; note that the first day of the season is reserved for men only! It is, however, entirely possible to climb the mountain as early as May or as late as November, although facilities en route will be limited.\n\nIn the autumn (around mid-October), the hike up the mountain is a great way to view fall colors. However, on weekends during this time, the trail towards the summit becomes crowded and a bit congested with hikers (some with dogs in tow). In the winter, a ski and snowboarding resort operates on the same grounds. The Joju shrine is open around the year and is a popular place to visit on New Year's Day.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe closest train station is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saijo"],["Iyo-Saijō"]]}," on the JR Yosan Line from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Matsuyama"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Takamatsu"]]},".
