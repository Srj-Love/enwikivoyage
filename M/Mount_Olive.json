The owners are a greek family who are always sitting at the booth nearest to the front desk. Usually very friendly, but not afraid to kick you out if your group is too crazy. Can be a fun place to hang out in, depending on what age group you are in (young). The food is not the greatest and it is a bit more expensive than other places, but it is open 24 hours.
