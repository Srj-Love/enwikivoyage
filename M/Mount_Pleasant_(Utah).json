Pleasant.  Due to problems with the Indians, the settlers left and went back to Ephraim, where they stayed until 1859 when they returned and settled the present site.  \n\nIn the 1890’s Mt. Pleasant could claim more liberal organizations and saloons than any other settlement in the county.  In 1875 a Presbyterian minister came to town and started to teach school.  This was the start of the Wasatch Academy, the oldest continually operating secondary school in Utah.  The campus of Wasatch is today listed on the National Register of Historic Places, as is the Mt. Pleasant Main Street.  \n\nMt. Pleasant is sometimes referred to as \"Hub City\" because of its near exact positioning in the center of the state.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nTo get to Mt.
