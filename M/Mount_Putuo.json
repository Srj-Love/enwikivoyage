The mountain is dedicated to Guanyin, often known in English as the Goddess of Mercy  or the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara.\n\nThere is an accommodation bureau at the port. The staff are extremely helpful, and provide reliable information on hotels and guest houses on the island. During national holidays, it is advisable to make prior room reservations, but this is not generally necessary at other periods. \n\nAnother tourist office is located on the main square near the Puji temple, and this is a good place to pick up free English-language guides and maps.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nWhether you arrive from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ningbo"]]},", from Zhoushan or direct from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai"]]},", it costs ¥160 (July 2010) to land on Putuoshan as the whole island is a National Park (for ¥5 more you can buy a \"Digital CD-ROM entry ticket\" for the island which includes a CD with a video about the island).\n\nDue to new bridges it is now possible to travel to Shenjiamen (from which it is only about a  15 minute ferry ride to Putuoshan) ",{"type":"'''","value":["entirely"]}," by bus from Shanghai and Ningbo.

However, as many bus stops are some distance from the temples, be prepared for some long walks. Furthermore, as bus signs are usually in Chinese characters and pinyin only, it's advisable to write down the name of your destination before you set out.\n\nIf weather permits, the island is best explored on foot. This allows you to avoid the crowds and also to visit pavilions and temples that are off the beaten track. The return journey can be made by bus.\n\nOf course, riding a mountain-bike would also be a great option, no cars, great scenery...But you can not hire bikes all over the island.
