The founding of Mount Rainier National Park was led by both local groups, including mountaineering clubs, newspaper editors, businessmen's associations, and University of Washington faculty, as well as by scientists throughout the country, primarily geologists.\n\nIt was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1997 as a showcase for the \"NPS Rustic\" style architecture of the 1920s and 1930s.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\nMount Rainier, at 14,410 feet, is the most prominent peak in the Cascade Range.  The mountain stands nearly three miles higher than the lowlands to the west and one and one-half miles higher than the adjacent mountains.  The volcano, which last erupted approximately 150 years ago, is encased in over 35 square miles of snow and ice.  The park's total area is 235,625 acres, of which 97% is designated Wilderness.  In addition to the mountain, the park contains outstanding examples of old growth forests and subalpine meadows.   The park contains 26 named glaciers across 9 major watersheds, with 382 lakes and 470 rivers and streams and over 3,000 acres of other wetland types.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\nThe park is part of a complex ecosystem. Vegetation is diverse, reflecting the varied climatic and environmental conditions encountered across the park’s 12,800-feet elevation gradient. Approximately 58 percent of the park is forested, 23 percent is subalpine parkland, and the remainder is alpine, half of which is vegetated and the other half consists of permanent snow and ice. Forest ages range from less than 100 years old on burned areas and moraines left by receding glaciers to old-growth stands 1,000 or more years. Some alpine heather communities have persisted in the park for up to 10,000 years.\n\nSpecies known or thought to occur in the park include more than 800 vascular plants, 159 birds, 63 mammals, 16 amphibians, 5 reptiles, and 18 native fishes.  Commonly seen animals include Columbian black-tailed deer, Douglas squirrels, noisy Stellar’s jays and common ravens.  Other animals that are less-commonly seen but still popular include mammals like elk and black bear, which range in many habitats throughout the summer.  Mountain goats typically remain in alpine or subalpine life zones.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nWeather patterns at Mount Rainier are strongly influenced by the Pacific Ocean, elevation, and latitude. The climate is generally cool and rainy, with summer highs in the 60s and 70s.
