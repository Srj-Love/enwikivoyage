He envisioned cavemen and prehistoric animals running amok atop the summit. Although far-fetched, the idea is a valid one: the tepuys are regarded as 'islands in time' by scientists since species have developed in complete isolation on top of them over millennia.\n\nFirst described by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1596, its 31km² summit area is surrounded by 400-metre-tall cliffs on all sides.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\nThe top of the tepuy consists of quartzite (hard) and sandstones (softer when weathered), they appear black due to added organic matter (moss, fungi) over millions of years.  Erosion on the top has created ponds and pols with crystal clear and crystal rain water, there are some areas with pink sands, which gives it a truly other world landscape feeling.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\nDue to its remote location, one-third of the plants evolved to be endemic to the table. Most of them became carnivorous.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nThe tepuy's steep sides, surrounding rainforest, and altitude at summit create a unique climatic environment that is most notable for its changeability.  Moist air rising off the surrounding rainforest in the tropical heat creates heavy rain clouds that billow up and across the summit of Roraima causing frequent showers and downpours.  Due to the altitude, nights on the summit are cool. You may find yopurself having to ascend or descend the path up the cliff in heavy rain in which case there will be torrents of water rushing down the track and waterfalls in the upper areas that will hit you like a fire hose. You may also need to wait at river crossings until the river level goes down.
