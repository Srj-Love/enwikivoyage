As you can guess from the name, you can also climb up this way on the back of camel, and the \"sawdust\" that appears to coat much of the length of the path is in fact dried camel byproducts from the many trips before you.  Be warned that the camel will bite you if it doesn't like you, so be nice, and a 3-hour ride up a mountain — going on foot is actually faster for most people — may not be the easiest introduction to the notoriously swaying gait of these camels.  You'll also have to dismount about a kilometer before you reach the top and cover the last 700 steps on foot.  Take care at the top also, as the surface is uneven."]},"\nAt the top you will find a small chapel dedicated to the Holy Trinity, constructed in 1934 on the ruins of an older 16th-century church.
