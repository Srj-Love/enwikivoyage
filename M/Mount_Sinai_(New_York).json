Sinai were the Native Americans, followed by colonial settlers.  In more recent years, new home construction began.  In the early 1960’s, the suburbanization of the once vast farmland increased.  Many people migrated east to escape the “city-life” and retreat to a quiet, family oriented suburban area. Within the past ten years, the development of Mt.

Each development has different amenities, appealing to different age groups, hobbies and social classes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nIn this small Long Island town there aren't endless options of entertainment.
