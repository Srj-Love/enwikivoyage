In 1982, the President and Congress created the 110,000-acre National Volcanic Monument, within the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, for research, recreation, and education.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nOn March 20, 1980, Mount St. Helens awakened from over 100 years of dormancy with a magnitude 4.1 earthquake which began a series of events leading to eruption.  Steam and ash eruption started on March 27, and over the next two months the north side of the mountain started bulging at the rate of about 5 to 6 feet a day.\n\nThen on May 18, 1980, at 8:32 a.m., a magnitude 5.1 earthquake caused the bulging north face to collapse in one of the largest landslides in recorded history.  The highly pressurized magma burst forth in an explosive eruption, sending super-heated volcanic gas and ash across a large portion of the United States, destroying hundreds of square miles of forest, and killing 57 people in what was the most destructive volcanic eruption in the United States.\n\nToday, over a quarter century later, life is starting to return to the barren landscape surrounding the mountain.  However, as the recent steam eruptions starting in October 2004 have illustrated, the danger of another catastrophic eruption is ever present.  Visiting Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument is to simultaneously witness the result of catastrophic destruction and see the result of rebirth.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\nMount St. Helens is a typical \"stratovolcano,\" the volcanic form most familiar from photographs of their typically conical profiles.  The great 1980 eruption destroyed most of the volcanic cone, leaving a huge amphitheater on the north side that is well seen from the Johnston Ridge observatory\/visitor center.  Current (2004-5) volcanic activity is building a new lava dome within this amphitheater, visible from the \"VolcanoCam\" at the observatory but not yet large enough to replace the destroyed cone.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Mount St Helens Summit Pano II.jpg"],["500px"],["thumbnail"],["panoramic view of Mount St Helens"]]},"\n\nSt. Helens is still glaciated to some extent, despite its reduced altitude.  One unexpected and remarkable bit of landscape on the mountain is the astonishing ",{"type":"'''","value":["Loowit Falls"]},", a waterfall that emerges directly from the amphitheater bearing meltwater from a glacier within the crater.  This falls can be seen (use binoculars) from the observatory, but to get the best feeling for the incongruity of the falls -- it seems to emerge as though from the surface of the moon -- requires a hike on a trail that is closed as of 2005 owing to the volcanic activity.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\nAs you explore the Monument it's easy to see the results of 30 years of ecosystem recovery. Plants that sprouted from buried soil and late lying snow banks have gradually spread, transforming a gray-brown landscape to green. Over time, these initial survivors have been joined by legions of colonizers as wind blown seeds of weedy plants like fireweed and pearly everlasting have taken root on shattered hillsides. In spring the Monument glows with the purple blossoms of penstemon and lupine. By late summer, magenta fireweed and patches of cream-colored pearly everlasting frame the blown down forest. In fall, Monument breezes will dance with cotton-covered seeds as life continues its march across the blast zone.  Watch for animals that have taken up residence in the developing forest. The once silent blast zone is punctuated by the calls of killdeer and red-winged blackbirds that have made their homes in lush shoreline vegetation. Red-tailed hawks can be spotted hunting for abundant mouse populations while osprey dive for trout in blast zone lakes. The open valleys and hillsides are a favorite feeding ground for North American elk. If you listen you can sometimes catch the echo of a whistling elk or maybe the howl of a lonely coyote.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nMost viewpoints on the Monument's north, east, and south sides can be reached from Memorial Day until snow closes the roads, usually in late October. Trails are generally open from June through October, although some lower elevation trails can be hiked all year.  The Mount St. Helens Visitor Center (Highway 504 milepost 5) now operated by Washington State Parks is open during the winter, except winter holidays.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nMount St. Helen's can be visited as a longish day trip from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Seattle"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Portland (Oregon)"],["Portland"]]},", or more conveniently as a side-trip while traveling between the two cities.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Warning:"]}," There are no gas\/petrol stations past the 18 mile point (from I-5) on Hwy 504.

Compared to many other active volcanoes, Mount St. Helens has been studied extensively, and therefore has a relatively well-defined \"safety envelope\" that allows informed decision making as regards trail closures, etc.  Even St. Helens, however, is prone to bouts of unexpectedly violent behavior, as for example on 8 March 2005 when an explosive event sent ash and steam to elevations above 35,000 feet (10 km) essentially without warning.  The monument, therefore, has established a policy regarding road and trail closures that at first glance appears unnecessarily conservative -- but it is not.  Believe it.  The closures aren't there simply to inconvenience and irritate you.  If a trail is closed due to eruptive hazard, ",{"type":"''","value":["stay off the trail"]},". \n\nOther than the volcanic activity, St. Helens poses basically the usual set of hazards associated with mountainous country -- changeable weather, potential for road closures due to snow in the winter, etc.  One extra thing to be aware of is that much of the area on the north side of the mountain, particularly the northeast, does not yet have many travel services, even things as basic as gas stations.  When leaving the main roads to head for the observatory, or particularly the Windy Ridge viewpoint and trailhead, it's wise to have a full gas tank.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Toutle"]]}," is the closest town to the park along the Spirit Lake Highway, offering amenities such as hotels and restaurants."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Mount Rainier National Park"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Portland (Oregon)"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Seattle"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Mount St. Helens"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["commons:Category:Mount St. Helens"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usablepark"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Southwest Washington"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["related"],["United States National Parks"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["46.2"],["-122.2"]]}]
