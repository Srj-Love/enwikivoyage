A brisk walk experiencing some of the culture and atmosphere of the city is a wonderful option for those wanting to warm up for the hike up the mountain itself.\n\nThe hike to the top of Tai Shan is an experience of beautiful sites with flora and fauna as well as a rich history of the mountain.  Hiking by foot, though physical in nature, is very achievable and is regularly accomplished by people of all ages.

The cable car also closes when there is thunder in the area, so it is vitally important to check the weather report beforehand. \n\nAfter climbing the most sacred mountain, it is only natural to pay respect to the wise man, Confucius.
