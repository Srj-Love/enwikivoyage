Home to historic Cornell College, Mount Vernon is a vibrant community uniquely influenced by the college but possessing an individual identity.  It is frequently cited in travel magazines for its unique culture and excellent food.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nIn many respects, while they maintain separate identities, the histories of Mount Vernon and Cornell College are inextricably linked.  Cornell was founded in 1853 as the Iowa Conference Seminary but, in 1857, it would be renamed after iron tycoon William Welsey Cornell, a distant cousin of Ezra Cornell (founded of Cornell University).  As the college expanded, the town invariably also enjoyed the benefit.  Today, many members of the faculty and staff at Cornell are also long-time residents and participants in the community, which gives the town a strong college feel.  The entire Cornell campus is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nMount Vernon has also historically benefited from its close proximity to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Iowa City"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dubuque"]]}," as it is the on the primary route between the two.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nMount Vernon is located primarily to the northwest of the intersection of Iowa Route 1 and US 30.  \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe primary method of travel within the city is car.
