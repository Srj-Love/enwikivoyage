Perhaps the state's most dramatic waterfall. The falls cascade through a series of gorges, and then drop 60 feet into a sparkling pool below. Wilderness camping available year round. There are two paths from the parking lot on the Massachusetts side of the park: One to a scenic lookout and the other to the falls. The view from the scenic lookout is a bit disappointing. From there, it is possible to do a difficult hike all the way down to the falls. The path from the falls back up to the parking lot is moderately difficult (make sure you take the path to the right parking lot, as there is one on the Massachusetts side and another on the New York side).
