You get a voucher that you need to change into an ordinary ticket at the south (main) entrance, so this does not avoid any trouble there.

You will get to see much more.  Otherwise you can try the local buses if you are up for adventure.\n\nUse Bus number 6 (¥2-3): It'll get you everywhere. From the station to the hotel, to the north and South entrances of the Wuyishan reserve.\nFrom the station you have to walk into the main street that you look into when you are in front of the station, until you hit a T-crossing. There you can just flag down any bus 6 on the opposite side of the road, because you need to go the south (the left) on the T-crossing. Don't get a taxi, because they are ¥30 and don't use the meter.\n\nTo use the bus service within Wuyishan Park, you used to have to pay ¥85, which is not necessary because you can walk to all the main sights and use the local bus service (bus 6) for only ¥2-3 to bring you to each entrance.

The \"rafts\" are long tied bamboo rafts with about six seats.  Life jackets are provided, although the water is very calm and this does not require any rafting experience or effort on the part of the riders. The river is quite shallow and not very wide. Two drivers use long poles to steer the craft down the water. The landscape is sensational, with sheer cliffs and tall mountains. Look out for the caves with very old coffins in them on the sheer cliff at the fourth bend. A \"cruise\" down all nine bends takes one and a half hours and is highly recommended. The price of the raft ride is regulated at ¥130 and tickets are obtained at the official ticket office (behind the new Best Western Hotel) at Xincun town at the start of the ride. You do not need to pay an \"entrance fee\" to do this trip.If you understand Chinese, you can pay 10 each to listen to the explanation by the drivers.\n\nDo not necessarily follow the crowds. Local tourists (lots of them) seem to follow each other, overlooking alternative paths. In consequence, a few steps may bring you away from the crowds, on an almost deserted but perfectly fine path. There are paved paths which take you into the mountains away from the river,through ancient cave dwellings and along the sides of cliffs as well as through tea gardens and sub-tropical forest. You can go for a whole day and see not another soul on the path. \n\nGo to the Lotus Peak entrance. There is no one there! The park officials will say it is not possible, because there are no official busses from the reserve that go there, but you can simply walk take a taxi or motor.

Prices for tea in China are rather like prices for wines in the West; there is plenty of reasonable stuff at decent prices, but something that is both top-quality and rare can cost a phenomenal amount. The record is held by some tea off a few bushes halfway up a cliff on Wu Yi Mountain, bushes whose product was once reserved for the Emperor. It fetched over $1000 US a gram at an auction in Shanghai!\n\nIf you play the game of Go (wei qi in Chinese), look in the shops downtown for\nwooden bowls to hold the go stones. These are under ¥50 a set and look\nmore-or-less identical to bowls sold in the West for several hundred US dollars.\nBe careful, however, to get bowls that are large enough; some of the ones sold\nhere will not hold a full set of stones.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nTry the tea eggs.
