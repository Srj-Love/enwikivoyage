Come on a weekday and have the course to yourself. Course has no sand bunkers and very little obstacles which makes it fun for the beginner golfer. Front nine is first time player friendly, but the back nine has a few holes in which you must tee off over a canyon. \nCourse fee= $18.\nGolf Carts= Yes \nBar= Yes \nRentals=Yes\n\nMountain Home Supercross Track: \nOpen June through September for practice and Races. $20 practice fee. Short but sweet track. Has a few table tops that are roughly 40-50 feet in length and a medium sized double in the middle of the track with a 30-40 foot clearance. An average rider can master this track within a few laps. Definitely worth it for its proximity to the city of mountain home. \n",{"type":"'''''","value":["'Directions"]},"': \nFollow Air Base road and turn right onto elmcrest street at the intersection by the chevron. Follow that road to the \"T\" intersection and take a left. the track will be on your right. There is also a BMX track next to it and they do some mud racing there. \n(For a cheaper ride follow Highway 67 toward grandview, If you hit the air base you missed the turn towards Grandview which you should have taken. Anyways, on 67 toward grandview you will see an open gate leading to a field full of trails and small rolling hills. Riding there is free.)\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=I-84.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["directionl1=w"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["The Dalles"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boise"]]}],["directionr1=E"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Twin Falls"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jerome (Idaho)"],["Jerome"]]}],["image2=US 20.svg"],["imagesize2=22"],["directionl2=W"],["majorl2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bend"]]}],["minorl2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boise"]]}],["directionr2=E"],["majorr2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Craters of the Moon National Monument"],["Craters of the Moon"]]}],["minorr2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Carey"]]}],["image3=US 26.svg"],["imagesize3=22"],["directionl3=W"],["majorl3=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Prineville"]]}],["minorl3=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boise"]]}],["directionr3=E"],["majorr3=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Craters of the Moon National Monument"],["Craters of the Moon"]]}],["minorr3=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gooding"]]}],["image4=US 30.svg"],["imagesize4=22"],["directionl4=W"],["majorl4=",{"type":"[[","value":[["The Dalles"]]}],["minorl4=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boise"]]}],["directionr4=E"],["majorr4=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Twin Falls"]]}],["minorr4=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Buhl"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["43.136944"],["-115.694444"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Southwestern Idaho"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Mountain Home, Idaho"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North_America\/United_States\/Idaho\/Localities\/M\/Mountain_Home\/"]]}]
