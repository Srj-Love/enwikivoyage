At its peak, Mrauk U controlled half of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bangladesh"]]},", modern day ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rakhine State"]]}," and the western part of Lower Burma. As the city grew, many pagodas and temples were built. Several of them remain, and are the main attraction of the city.\n\nThe best time to visit Mrauk U is from November-mid-March when it's cooler in the morning with attractive mists.\n\nForeign nationals must pay a USD5 fee in Mrauk U.

There were 2 large ferries running from Sittwe to Mrauk: the ex-government boat (XGov, now privatised) and the Aung Kyan Moe (AKM) double-decker boat. For both, tourists USD10, 7 hr. An express boat is USD20, 3 hr. You will be met at Sittwe airport by a tout selling private boats \/places on private boats (5 passengers+, USD20, 6 hr, one-way), which may be useful if it goes that afternoon, as you save a night in Sittwe.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Sittwe to Mrauk U"]},": a ferry goes  M (AKM); Tu (XGov); F (Xgov); Sa (AKM) at 07:00.

Express boat Th, 07:00.  \n\nFood is available for purchase. The ferry is not in great condition, but seems safe enough. Be warned though that the ferry has been known to skip a day or two every now and then so, if relying on it for travel, keep a reasonable buffer to avoid getting stuck. Private boats are available for rent in Sittwe and may do the trip considerably faster (4 to 6 hr) for USD80 (2008 price) depending on your negotiating skills and the number in your party. The principal advantage of renting a private boat is that you are no longer tied to the ferry schedule. In high season 2011 there were private boats leaving Mrauk U seemingly every day, which you could join for negotiated fare. Flights from Yangon arrive in Sittwe in the afternoon and it is easy to rent a boat and be in Mrauk U in the evening which means a travel time of one day from Yangon. With the government ferry, count on at least two days to get from Yangon to Mrauk U, longer if you arrive the day before a ferry off-day. \n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:IMG3800 Burma Mrauk U Local peoples Transportation (7506306976).jpg"],["thumb"],["Local Transportation"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By road "]},"\nBuses leave for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sittwe"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yangon"]]}," every morning, but foreign travellers are not permitted to travel to Mrauk U overland.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get around "]},"\nIn Mrauk U you can either walk, rent a bicycle (available from most hotels), hire a trishaw or a horse cart.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" See "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:ShittaungPagodeDerFussi.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Inside the Shittaung Pagoda"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Archaeology Museum"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Just inside the royal palace"],["phone="],["fax="],["hours="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["price=Free"],["content=A collection of artifacts from the Mrauk U sites: Buddhas, slabs with inscriptions, Wethali era coins, paintings that show Mrauk U in its heyday, and an excellent model of Mrauk U that will help you get your bearings.
