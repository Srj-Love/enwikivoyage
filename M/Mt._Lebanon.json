Lebanon. \n\nThe Port Authority provides public transit access from Pittsburgh to Mt. Lebanon - including the \"T\" light rail service. The 42C and 42S rail lines will take you from Downtown through the small suburb of Dormont to Mt. Lebanon station, which will put you directly in Uptown Mt. Lebanon. The 42C stops at Castle Shannon, a suburb located due east of Mt. Lebanon, while the 42S (along with the 47S, which does not serve Uptown) continues south to serve South Hills Village, a mall just beyond the southern end of Mt. Lebanon. Most of Mt. Lebanon lies within Zone 1, where the fare is $2 for a trip from downtown, while South Hills Village lies in Zone 2, where the fare is $2.60 from downtown.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Mt.
