In 1850 Local G.P. Dr William Penny-Brookes (1809 - 1895), who introduced physical education into British schools, inspired the fore-runner of the modern Olympic Games for the \"promotion of moral, physical and intellectual improvement\" and although the Game's venue is now decided by international committee rather than by the parish council, we still hold our own Olympics here in protest every July - the other Olympics are also doing quite well too!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Wenlock Priory"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.english-heritage.org.uk\/daysout\/properties\/wenlock-priory\/"],["email="],["address=5 Sheinton Street, TF13 6HS"],["lat=52.597922"],["long=-2.555457"],["directions="],["phone=+44 1952 727466"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=adults £4.10, children £2.50, concessions £3.70"],["content=Spectacular ruins located on the edge of the town which are the remains of a 12th-century church that belonged to the Cluniac monastery, refounded in 1079 and 1082, on the site of an earlier 7th century foundation, by Roger de Montgomery. It is thought to be the final resting place of St Milburga, whose bones were discovered during restoration work in 1101. Wenlock Priory is the perfect place to sit on a warm, mid-summer day and relax. The delightful grounds contain a well groomed collection of topiary."]]}]},"\nMuch Wenlock Museum houses a collection of memorabilia relating to the town and its townsfolk. It also houses a separate Olympic collection.\n\nMuch Wenlock's Holy Trinity Church is Norman and has a battlemented tower and Jacobean pulpit with carved panels, depicting, rather oddly, some two-tailed mermen.\n\nNearby are Benthall Hall, a 16th Century house with stunning interior and carefully restored plantsman's garden, and Broseley Pipe Works, a Victorian clay tobacco pipe works.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nFollow the Olympian trail around the town and learn about Much Wenlock's Olympic connections. Collect a leaflet from the Visitor Information Centre and follow a self-led tour following the 'markers' imbedded into the streets.\n\nTake a walk along Wenlock Edge. Above the town rises the Wenlock Edge which provides glorious views. This 15 mile limestone escarpment was created when Shropshire could be found just south of the equator - some 400 million years ago. Looked after by the National Trust, The Edge and its ancient woodlands are excellent for walks, cycling and riding. Long distance routes like the Jack Mytton Way and Shropshire Way pass over Wenlock Edge.\n\nVisit Tales from the Edge, the world-famous international storytelling festival which takes places in Much Wenlock every July.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["buy"],["name=Wenlock Books"],["url=http:\/\/www.wenlockbooks.co.uk"],["email="],["address=12 High St, Much Wenlock"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Half way down Much Wenlock High Street (one-way) on the right hand side."],["phone = +44 1952 727877"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=9:00-5:30 Mon-Sat (occasional opening on Sundays, call for details."],["price="],["content=A superb independent bookstore with extremely friendly and thouroughly knowledgeable staff."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nMuch Wenlock is home to a selection of restaurants, pubs and inns.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["drink"],["name=The George and Dragon"],["url="],["email="],["address=2 High St, Much Wenlock, Shropshire, TF 13 6AA"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +44 1952 727312"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["drink"],["name=The Talbot Inn"],["url=http:\/\/www.thetalbotinnwenlock.co.uk\/"],["email="],["address=13 High St, Much Wenlock, Shropshire"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +44 1952 727077"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["drink"],["name=The Gaskell Arms"],["url=http:\/\/www.gaskellarms.co.uk\/"],["email="],["address=A458, Much Wenlock, Shropshire, TF13 6AQ"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=The Raven Hotel"],["url=http:\/\/www.ravenhotel.com"],["email=enquiry@ravenhotel.com"],["address=Barrow Street"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +44 1952 727251"],["tollfree="],["fax=+44 1952 728416"],["hours="],["price=Doubles: £120\/165 (Su-Th\/F-Sa)"],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nwhy not investigate Wenlock Priory, Wenlock Edge, The Egde Arts Centre, Much Wenlock Guildhall......\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Much Wenlock"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["52.5966"],["-2.5580"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Shropshire"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Europe\/United Kingdom\/England\/Shropshire\/Much Wenlock\/"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Much Wenlock"]]}]
