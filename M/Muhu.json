The ferries are operated by ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.laevakompanii.ee Saaremaa Laevakompanii"]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By ice road"]},"\nDuring winter time, an ice road connects the mainland to Muhu. An ice road differs by letting people drive at quite a high speed with safety belts open. The speed is reduced only while approaching the cracks that one has to cross over the boards fixed on the cracks. It takes approximately 20 minutes to cover the distance in case of favourable conditions. You can even pass the ferries that \"drive\" on the next line.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nMuhu is well connected by a network of buses from most other cities in the region and from Tallinn.

It's the natural habitat to 23 species of very rare orchids. Muhu is also home to many migrating birds, which take temporarily shelter in the various bays. \n\nVillages on Muhu are even today still headed by traditional village eldermen, who take up the role of voluntary counsel. Many of the villages are charming in their simplicity and worth having a look (especially because in terms of tourism, Muhu has remained rather untainted so far).\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=St Catherine Church"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=It's one of the oldest in Estonia and is notable for its trapezium-shaped tombstones with pagan symbols.
