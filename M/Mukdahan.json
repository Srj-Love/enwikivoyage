Its history dates from the late Ayutthaya period, over 200 years ago. At first, on the left side of the Mekong River, there was a large community called Ban Luang Phon Sin located by Phrathat Ing Hang, presently in Savannakhet Province of Lao PDR. The community was ruled by Chao Chan Suriyawong. His son was Chao Kinnari. He later built a new town at the mouth of Huai Muk on the right bank of the Mekong River in 1767. The town was completed in 1770 and named \"Mukdahan\" (moonstone or pearl) according to a propitious sign occurring to him while the town was under construction. That is why the locals call the town \"Mueang Muk\".\n\nMukdahan is a gateway to other Indochinese countries. The local people of Mukdahan have had a long relationship with the people in Savannakhet Province of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Laos"]]},", although they are separated by the Mekong River.

There is a regular bus connection between the cities; a one-way ticket costs 100 baht. While there is no formal bus stop at either end of the bridge, passengers need to disembark for the border formalities on both sides; hence in practice it's possible to buy a ticket and board the bus on the border if you've arrived there by other means.\n\nThere is a car park on the Mukdahan side of the bridge, one night's parking costs 100 baht. With the correct paperwork it's possible to drive your car over to Laos. There are no pedestrian lanes on the bridge.\n\nVisa-on-arrival is available at the border post for those nationalities that require one (see the article on ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Laos#Get_in"],["Laos"]]}," for more details). Additionally, the Lao border officials charge an \"entry fee\" (40-170 baht), \"exit fee\" (40 baht) and after 16:00, an \"overtime fee\" (40 baht) for stamping one's passport. \n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Mukdahan"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["16.543056"],["104.722778"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Northern Isaan"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Mukdahan"]]}]
