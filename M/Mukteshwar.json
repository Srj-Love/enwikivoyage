Kathgodam is the last Railhead for the region and serves as the base for all road journeys to Naukuchiyatal, Nainital, Bhimtal, Almora, Munsiyari, Mukteshwar etc. Mukteshwar is about 70km from Kathgodam and will take you about four hours as you climb to about 2450m (8000 ft). From Kathgodam hire a cab to Mukteshwar. If travelling alone get on one of the many shared-cabs to Bhowali, and then change for Mukteshwar. If you're travelling in the morning expect to have a large and interesting local populace travelling with you on your way to Mukteshwar from Bhowali. The vehicles are used to transport not just people, but also essential goods such as milk, newspapers and an abundance of local flowers. If you are not comfortable on mountain roads, try to get a seat in the front. The roads are rather twisty and can cause discomfort to some people.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nMukteshwar is a tiny hamlet, and is best seen on foot. Take leisurely strolls along the main road - which is no more than 2 meters wide at any point - from the IVRI till the PWD House whilst taking in the spectacular views of the mountains.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["IVRI and 350 year old temple of lord Shiva."]},{"type":"*","value":["All that you perhaps need to do is walk outside your hotel room to see the Himalayan range"]},{"type":"*","value":["PWD bungalow which provides a panoramic view of the Himalayan range, and also is the place that Jim Corbett stayed at many times during his hunt for the man-eating tiger."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Mukteshwar is a great place to do ",{"type":"'''","value":["Rock Climbing"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Rappeliing"]}," as it offers high and straight rock faces at Chauli Ki Jali.

There also is the Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam tourist hotel which has a terrific location, next to the PWD circuit house. The circuit house, by the way, has housed Jim Corbett for long stretches in the past.\n\nShreehariresort is another quiet place to live. The resort is the only accommodation available at Mukteshwar (0 Milestone), which is surrounded by thick coniferous forest as seen from the front side of the rooms. There are a bunch of other places to stay at just outside of Mukteshwar. Mountain Trails is one of them, and there is Krishna Resorts. The former is pretty well located for scenic views.\n\nIt is better that you stay at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Peora"]]}," which is about 10 km from Mukteswar on way to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Almora"]]}," and good apartments are available for staying in comfort (Resort Sequester).
