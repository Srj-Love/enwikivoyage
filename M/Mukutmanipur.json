Mukutmonipur is 55 km from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bankura"]]}," and is situated near the confluence of rivers Kangsabati and Kumari. Green forests  surround the vast bluish tract of water. Hillocks are essentially a dream come here. The place is very much famous for its superb natural beauty. The undulating terrain along the southern edge of the Kangsabati Water Reservoir spreads as a  three-dimensional necklace of green and terracotta colour. The stand-till water of the reservoir looks like a large blue tinted glass mirror reflecting the  vast expanse of sky over it. The vastness  of the lake stretches as far one's eye can reach. The view of the sunset with the lake in the fore ground is breath-taking. One must also experience the moonlit night around the reservoir. The surface of the static water turns into a shiny silvery plate gifted by God.\n\nJhilimili is situated around 15 km away from Mukutmanipur. A travel from Ranibandh to Jhilimili offers a wonderful exposure  to spectacular forest of varying heights on both sides on the route, and finally reaching Jhilimili mounted on the top of a hillock is a great experience. The sparkle of micaceous soil adds to the beauty of the environment.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nTrains are available from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kolkata"]]}," to the nearest railhead ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bankura"]]},".
