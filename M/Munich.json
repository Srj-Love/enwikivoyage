By that time, Henry the Lion had built a bridge over the river Isar next to a settlement of Benedictine monks. Almost two decades later, in 1175 Munich was officially granted city status and received fortification. In 1180, with the trial of Henry the Lion, Otto I Wittelsbach became Duke of Bavaria and Munich was handed over to the Bishop of Freising. The Wittelsbach dynasty would rule Bavaria until 1918. In 1255, when the Duchy of Bavaria was split in two, Munich became the ducal residence of Upper Bavaria. In the late 15th century, Munich underwent a revival of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gothic architecture"],["Gothic"]]}," arts: the Old Town Hall (",{"type":"''","value":["Altes Rathaus"]},") was enlarged, and Munich's largest Gothic church, the ",{"type":"''","value":["Frauenkirche"]}," cathedral, was constructed in only 20 years, starting in 1468.\n\nWhen Bavaria was reunited in 1506, Munich became its capital. The arts and politics became increasingly influenced by the court, and Munich became a centre of the German counter-reformation as well as of Renaissance arts. The Catholic League was founded in Munich in 1609. During the Thirty Years' War, Munich became an electoral residence. In 1632, the city was occupied by Swedish King Gustav II Adolph. \n\nAfter World War I, the city was at the centre of political unrest. In November 1918, on the eve of revolution, the royal family fled the city. After the murder of the first republican premier of Bavaria in February 1919, the Bavarian Soviet Republic was proclaimed, but it was put down on 3 May 1919 by conservative troops. While the republican government had been restored, Munich subsequently became a hotbed of extremist politics, among which Adolf Hitler and National Socialism rose to prominence. In 1923 Hitler and his supporters, who were then concentrated in Munich, staged the Beer Hall Putsch, an attempt to overthrow the Weimar Republic and seize power. The revolt failed, resulting in Hitler's arrest and the temporary crippling of the Nazi Party, which was virtually unknown inside and outside Munich at that time.\n\nThe city once again became a Nazi stronghold when the National Socialists took power in Germany in 1933. The National Socialist Workers Party created the first concentration camp at Dachau, 15km (10 mi) north-west of the city. Because of its importance to the rise of National Socialism, Munich was referred to as the \"Capital of the Movement\" (",{"type":"''","value":["\"Hauptstadt der Bewegung\""]},"). Munich was also the base of the White Rose (",{"type":"''","value":["Weiße Rose"]},"), a student resistance movement from June 1942 to February 1943. However, the core members—including Hans and Sophie Scholl—were arrested and executed following a distribution of leaflets at the University of Munich. The city was heavily damaged by allied bombing during World War II, with 90% of the historic city centre and 50% overall destroyed.\n\nAfter the US occupation in 1945, Munich was completely rebuilt. Munich was the site of the 1972 Olympic Summer Games, during which Israeli athletes were assassinated by Palestinian terrorists.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Economy"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Bmw-hochhaus 1.jpg"],["thumb"],["BMW headquarters"]]},"\n\nMunich is the German economic powerhouse, with six out of the 30 companies listed in the German blue-chip stock-market index DAX. This includes luxury car maker BMW, electrical engineering giant Siemens, and the world's largest insurance company Allianz, to name just the biggest companies.\n\nThe Munich region is a centre for aerospace, biotechnology, software and service industries. As the largest publishing city in Europe, Munich is home to ",{"type":"''","value":["Süddeutsche Zeitung"]},", one of Germany's largest and most influential daily newspapers. Germany's largest commercial network, Pro7-Sat1 Media AG is located in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Munich\/East"],["Eastern Munich"]]},".\n\nMunich's flourishing local economy is reflected in its place in quality-of-life rankings of world cities. Monocle magazine even named it the world's most livable city in 2010. People continue to flock into the city due to its proximity to the Alps and some of the most beautiful scenery in Europe, especially Baroque and Rococo architecture and green countryside which starts a mere half hour away on the ",{"type":"''","value":["S-Bahn"]},". However, there's a price to pay for living here: Munich is the most expensive city in Germany. Real estate development and hotel construction are a regular sight, but so far, demand outstrips supply by far.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Culture"]},"\nThe people of Munich do not like their city to be associated only as a city of beer and the Oktoberfest, and indeed the Bavarian Kings transformed Munich into a city of arts and science in the 19th century, and also quite notable architecture. Many of the city's finest buildings belong to this period and were built under the first three Bavarian kings during the first half of the 19th century. Munich's outstanding position among other German cities may have faded a bit, due to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Berlin"]]}," becoming the German capital again in the 1990s, but it is still a vibrant and important city of culture.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:München Nationaltheater Interior.jpg"],["thumb"],["Inside the Nationaltheater"]]},"\n\nThe ",{"type":"''","value":["Nationaltheater"]},", where several of Richard Wagner's operas had their premières under the patronage of King Ludwig II, is the home of the world famous Bavarian State Opera and the Bavarian State Orchestra. Next door the modern Residenz Theatre was erected in the building that had housed the Cuvilliés Theatre before World War II. Many operas were staged there, including the premiere of Mozart's \"Idomeneo\" in 1781. The Gärtnerplatz Theatre is a ballet and musical state theatre, while another opera house, ",{"type":"''","value":["Prinzregententheater"]}," has become the home of the Bavarian Theatre Academy. The modern Gasteig center houses the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\nMany prominent writers worked in Munich. The period immediately before World War I saw economic and cultural prominence for the city. Munich and especially its then suburbs of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Schwabing"]]}," and Maxvorstadt, became the domicile of many artists and writers. Nobel laureate Thomas Mann, who also lived there, wrote ironically in his novella \"Gladius Dei\" about this period, \"Munich shone\". It remained a center of cultural life during the Weimar period with figures such as Bertolt Brecht and Lion Feuchtwanger.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:M eg seehaus.jpg"],["thumb"],["Beer garden inside the Englischer Garten"]]},"\n\nBavaria has been the long-time antipode of Berlin: While the Protestant Prussian kings focused on building military strength, Bavaria's Catholic Wittelsbach kings were more interested in creating a centre of arts and science following the examples of cities in northern Italy. Bavaria takes a position among the German states with a strong emphasis on its independence and has its own conservative party, the CSU, which strongly advocates Bavarian interests in Berlin.\n\n",{"type":"''","value":["Münchner"]}," share a lot of characteristics with the rest of Bavaria and indeed it became popular again among older and younger people to wear traditional Bavarian clothing at least during the Oktoberfest and similar traditional beer festivals. One notable difference is politics: whereas the rest of Bavaria is a stronghold of conservative Catholicism, Munich has been governed by a liberal coalition of Social Democrats, Greens and the Rosa Liste (a gay rights party), and only 36.2% of residents are members of the Catholic church while 13.3% are Protestant, 0.3% Jewish and 50.3% are members of another religion or follow no religion.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Talk"]},"\nThe official language in Munich is, of course, German. With many Munich residents coming from other German regions or from abroad, \"Standard German\" dominates as the spoken language in Munich. Nevertheless, some residents speak with a more or less strong Bavarian dialect, which can deviate substantially from the German taught at schools. English is widely spoken and understood throughout the city in restaurants, cafés, tourist attractions and shops, and by most citizens.

There are 16 rings in total. Almost all U-Bahn stations are within the rings 1–4. As of June 2014, a week ticket for rings 1-2 costs €13,70. Rings 1-4 cost €19,60.\n\nFor several journeys on different days the blue stripe card (",{"type":"''","value":["Streifenkarte"]},"), with 10 strips, is a better value than buying lots of individual tickets. The cost is €12.50, and may be purchased at dispensing machines at every station. You need to use two strips for each coloured zone on the map. If you are making several trips a day, the day ticket is a better option.\n\nIf you plan to explore Munich and see all the sights and tourist attractions, buy the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.citytourcard-muenchen.com\/english\/munich-citytourcard\/mnchenstart.html ",{"type":"''","value":["Munich CityTourCard"]}]},"; this a valid for all public transportation services in Munich and a discount card for many tourist attractions like museums, sights, shopping or gastronomy.

In most other German cities, passengers can validate tickets on the train; however, this is not the case in Munich, so be sure to validate your ticket before boarding any U-Bahn or S-Bahn train.\n\nPublic transportation operates with limited service from 02:00 to 05:00. The U-Bahn does not operate at all during this time, and trams and some buses operate only in one hour intervals from Monday to Friday and on 30-minute intervals on the weekend. On Friday, Saturday and nights before public holidays, there is a single S-Bahn on each line between 02:30 and 03:00.

Guided tours are available, or for the independent-minded, rentals and maps are available at Munich Central Station (",{"type":"''","value":["Hauptbahnhof"]},") and other areas of the city.\n\nBikes can also be rented by the ",{"type":"''","value":["Call-A-Bike system"]},", which is run by Deutsche Bahn. You need to call a number listed on the bikes from your mobile phone and register with the callabike.de website in order to use them. The service is convenient, as you just spot an available bike throughout the city and just leave it at your destination. However, this is not an economical alternative if you are planning many trips in a single day. In that case, it is better to get a day or multiday rental from one of the rental services located throughout central Munich.\n\nMunich is generally a bike-friendly city, with many designated bike lanes (especially along river Isar, in the parks and even in the city centre). Rates of accidents involving bicycles are rising in Munich. Hence, the police enforces traffic rules for cyclists more rigorous, especially at the beginning of the bike season in spring. Fines range from €10 for driving without light during nighttime to €100 for ignoring red traffic lights. Drunk cycling can result in hefty fines and even in detention. Helmets are not required for cyclists, but are recommended.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\n\nAs everywhere in Germany, Munich taxi cabs can easily be recognized by their beige color and the yellow-black taxi sign on the roof. Taxis can be found at taxi stands throughout the city, at train stations and at the airport. It is also possible to flag down a taxi (if it is not occupied) or to call one of the many taxi companies of Munich. Prices are regulated by the city government. The basic fare is €3.30 with additional €1.70 per kilometer for up to 5 kilometers, €1.50 per kilometer for 5–10 km, and €1.40 per km for every additional kilometer above 10. Waiting time per hour is €24 and there are additional charges for pets (€0.60 per animal) and luggage (€0.60 per piece).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nIt is generally a bad idea to explore Munich by car. Traffic is heavy especially during rush hour, and parking tends to be close to impossible. Moreover, many landmarks and areas of touristic interest are in the inner city, which is largely closed for car traffic. Close to the historic city centre, parking space is scarce and expensive.\n\nDriving may be an option for visiting some of the attractions in suburban Munich like the Bavaria Film Studios or for making day trips to cities and lakes outside of Munich.\n\nMunich has three ring-roads: the autobahn ",{"type":"''","value":["A 99"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["Mittlerer Ring (B 2R)"]}," urban expressway and ",{"type":"''","value":["Altstadtring"]},", which can be used to avoid getting stuck in inner-city traffic. However, during rush hours these rings are often congested, too. In July and August when people from the rest of Germany, northern Europe and the Benelux countries travel to the beaches of the Adriatic Sea and back home (half of them towing a caravan) you're almost guaranteed to get into traffic jams around Munich. \n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Parking"]},"\n\nPrices for parking on streets range from €1 to €2.50 per hour, usually from 08:00 to 23:00. There may be additional restrictions, e.g. for the maximum duration. Throughout the city centre there are \"blue zones\". Wherever you find blue lines on the ground, you can park your car for a maximum time of 2 hours (hourly rate €2.50). The meaning of other colours is as follows:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"''","value":["dotted blue line"]},"—space for disabled drivers.

However it can take some time to find a free parking spot. Parking garages are indicated with blue rectangular signs with a capital white \"P\". Usually a green sign indicates that there are free spots while a red sign indicates that the car park is full. The city has a car park routing system which shows you where you can find a parking slot. Rates are:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" from €2–6 per hour (most will charge around €3 per hour)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" from €8–30 per day (most will charge €15–20 per day)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" some may even offer monthly rates, expect €100 per month minimum"]},"\nOutside the historic city centre (where the colour scheme isn't used), parking along the streets is mostly only allowed for residents with a special parking permit.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Towing"]},"\n\nThe police may tow your car away if it obstructs the traffic or endangers other people. Watch out for fire brigage access roads which are marked with small signs reading \"",{"type":"''","value":["Feuerwehrzufahrt"]},"\". There is no stopping and standing, parking will result in immediate towing.\n\nIf your car has been towed away contact the next available police station. There is a central place where all towed cars will be brought to (Thomas-Hauser Straße 19; open 24\/7; ",{"type":"''","value":["S2\/S4"]}," to station ",{"type":"''","value":["Berg am Laim"]},", Bus 146 to Iltisstraße until stop ",{"type":"''","value":["Thomas-Hauser Straße"]},", 5 min to walk from there). You need to show your passport\/ID, drivers licence and registration document and you will have to pay a fine—expect around €150.\n\nA constant harassment are the private towing companies that guard private parking spaces such as those of supermarkets. Their fines can easily double or triple the police's fines.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Bbb München Marienkirche.JPG"],["thumb"],["Munich Cathedral (",{"type":"''","value":["Frauenkirche"]},") and New City Hall (",{"type":"''","value":["Neues Rathaus"]},")"]]},"\n\nMunich offers visitors many sights and attractions.

Especially at weekends you should try to get in the tents before 10AM. During the week, most tents are open all day, however it is not easy to get a seat if you are many people and as a general rule, you won't get served if you haven't got a seat. It is not recommended to leave the tent if you want to get in it later the day. So you have to decide early in the morning if you want to go in a certain tent or you want to enjoy the rides like the coaster with 5 loops. ",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"Some tents, such as the ",{"type":"''","value":["Hofbräu Festzelt"]}," have a standing area that do not require seating; as such, you can sometimes get into this tent later than with other ones. If the weather is nice, you can enjoy your beer any time at the open air tables besides the beer tents. You won't experience the typical beer tent atmosphere with Bavarian oompah music though.\n\nSome issues to take note of when planning your visit to the Oktoberfest:\n# Accommodation will sold out fast during the weekends and pretty hard to find during the week.Hotel prices can easily double to triple during Oktoberfest. \n# Smoking is forbidden within the tents but some tents feature designated, secluded outside smoking areas. Think twice if you want to go out for smoking since you may not get in again.\n# The main underground station \"Theresienwiese\" (lines U4 and U5) is very crowded and is sometimes closed to avoid congestion. An alternative is the station \"Goetheplatz\" (lines U3 and U6). It's crowded too, but you will still have some air to breathe there. Just follow the crowd when you get out of the station.\n# In most tents the bar closes at 10:30pm while the tent closes at 11:30pm. You should finish your beer before then since the security will ruthlessly clear the area.\n# Tents open at 10am (9am on weekends). The first day is tapping day (German \"Anstich\"). There is no beer served before noon and since the tents will surely be crowded by then, it will take some time until everyone is served.\n# If you are with small children, try to avoid the weekends. Every Tuesday from 12 to 6pm is family day with discounts on many rides.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Maibaum_München.JPG"],["thumb"],["right"],["Maypole in Munich"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Other festivals "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Maibaum aufstellen"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.bayern.by\/portal\/frontend.php?lang=en&artid={f2e19bcd-7974-a0a2-ba0b-53bcb8e271de}"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=—On 1st May (which is a public holiday in Germany) strange things happen in some Upper Bavarian villages and even in Munich.
