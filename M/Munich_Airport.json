However, in 1992 the airport was moved to its current location to meet the demand for more capacity and more modern facilities. Due to the constantly increasing number of flights, the airport has continued to expand since then and now offers connections to most airports in Germany and Europe, as well as many intercontinental destinations. Incidentally, the airport grounds in Riem were transformed into the new Munich fairground, which moved from the city centre.\n\nCurrently there are two terminals in use and a satellite terminal is under construction, which is scheduled for opening in 2015. Most of the airport's facilities, including its two terminals, are in the area between the two runways. \n\nIn 2011, Munich Airport was named the winner of the \"Best Airport in Europe\" award for the third year in a row based on a worldwide survey of close to eight million passengers. Passengers also ranked Munich #4 in the global rankings behind three Asian hubs.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:1D MUC.JPG"],["thumbnail"],["right"],["Inside Terminal 1, Module D"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Terminal 1"]},"\nAll airlines that are not members of Star Alliance, with the exception of Turkish Airlines that on 12 May 2014 moves to Terminal 1C, are based in Terminal 1, the older terminal.

The terminal is segmented into six modules: A, B, C, D, E and F. Modules A-D provide all facilities required to handle departures and arrivals, including landside drive-by lanes and parking, whereas module E is only equipped to handle arrivals. This design essentially makes each module a self-contained sub-terminal of its own, small and comfortable despite the total size of the terminal. Module F is used only for high-risk flights, particularly to Israel. The terminal has several levels: the train station is on level 2; the passenger transport system, which connects the modules, on level 3; check-in counters, security checkpoints, arrival areas, customs and most restaurants are on level 4 (ground level); level 5 is used by passengers with connecting flights.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Module F"]},"\nModule F is a separate module north of terminal 2.
