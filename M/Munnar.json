Three rivers - Madupetti, Nallathanni and Periavaru which flow through this town, but join some distance away from Munnar.\n\nMunnar is famous for its tea plantations, many of them started by the British. The \"Kannan Devan\" brand of Tea from the Tata is cultivated and processed here.\n\nThe strobilanthus (\"neelakurinji\" in Malayalam, the local language), a blue flower which blooms only every 12 years, is found in this region. It bloomed last in December 2006. Munnar also has the highest peak in South India, Anamudi, at 2,695 m.\n\nEravikulam national park is one of the main tourist attraction, where you can find the endangered species of Nilgiri Tahr (mountain goat called \"varayadu\" in Malayalam).
