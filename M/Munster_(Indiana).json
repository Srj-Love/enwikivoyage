Settled and established in 1845 by the Brass family when they built a two-story inn and tavern, Munster became very popular soon after in 1853 as a place for truck farms because of the growing market in the near-by Chicago. Munster began to grow as a community and grew in skilled worker men such as oil men, steel workers, and buisness men from the city. \nToday Munster is a quite town that is in the midst of continual growth. The town is excellent at planning and has developed an award winning school system. Despite growing larger and larger everyday, Munster has a small town friendly demeanor and one is always welcomed with a genuine interest.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nLansing Municipal Airport\n18200 Chicago Ave\nLansing, Illinois 60438\nUnited States\n\nMidway International Airport\n5600 S Cicero Ave \nChicago, IL 60638 \n\nO'Hare International Airport\nP.O.
