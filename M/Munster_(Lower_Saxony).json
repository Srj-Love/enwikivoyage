The town centre is very clean and modern with plenty of opportunities to visit coffee shops and cafes as  well as the local market open at weekends.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nThe town is home to the German Army's largest garrison and is situated between the two training areas of Munster North and Munster South. Munster has been closely associated with the military for over 100 years. However the use of this area as a training ground goes back to 1893. The Munster military training areas, represent nearly 50% of the city's total area, are reserved for military use. Due to the restricted areas, many rare species and habitats can be found in this region. The region's populations of rare species have been previously drawn upon to restore populations in other regions where such species are endangered.\n\nThe Bundeswehr's Research Institute for Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Warfare Defence is located in Munster. In 1916, the German Empire opened Gasplatz Breloh (\"Breloh Gas Facility\"), an area dedicated to research in and production of chemical weapons.  In 1935, the Third Reich reopened the site as an experimental research and production area for chemical ammunitions under the name Heeresnebelfüllstelle Raubkammer (\"Army fog-filling plant, Raubkammer\"), \"fog\" being used as a cover for chemical agents. During World War II, large quantities of sulphur mustard gas and the nerve agent were produced here. At the end of the war, Germany had a continuous production line for GB ready to go online; this plant was dismantled by the British Occupation Forces and later shipped to Porton Down, Great Britain.\n\nThe close relationship between the civil and the military circles is symbolized by the bronze statue of Lili Marleen. She and her soldier have been greeting all visitors for more than twenty years from their point of welcome beside the town gate leading to the centre of Munster. Thousands of visitors each year are attracted to the German Tank Museum. In Munster there is a wide range of hotels, holiday apartments and a 4-star camping site. There are several restaurants and guesthouses offering ranges of food. There is plenty of free parking available.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nMunster is situated little more than 1 hours driving time from the 3 International Airports of ",{"type":"''","value":["Hamburg ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.airport.de\/en\/index.phtml?"]},",Bremen ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.airport-bremen.de\/en\/"]}," and Hanover ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.hannover-airport.de\/index.php?L=1"]}]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hannover"]]}," airport is 107kms from Munster.
