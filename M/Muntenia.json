The place is one of the many in Romania connected to legends about Vlad Țepeș \"Dracula\". It is said that Țepeș was buried in the monastery church, but there is no hard evidence for that. The monastery is located on an small island on the Snagov lake and can be reached using a bridge. Finding the place is not very easy, because there is a lack of markers. When you finally reach the island you'll be confronted with quite  an unfriendly priest that, without any sign of welcome, demands RON15 (ca. €4) as entrance fee not for the church, but for the island. The subjective value of the place might not justify the trouble of getting to it.
