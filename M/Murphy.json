Proceeding east along Hwy 19\/74 takes your through Andrews, the Nantahala Gorge, and on to Asheville.\n\nIt sounds complicated, but it isn't. The four-lane highway running east and west through Murphy takes you from Chattanooga to Asheville (or vice-versa) with no turns. It's just the numbers on the road that change.\n\nMurphy is also located about 100 miles or so from Knoxville, Tennessee; Greenville, South Carolina; and Atlanta, Georgia. Travel to these towns is a bit more complicated because of the lack of highways.\n\nThe roads in and out of Murphy are generally well-maintained and are of good quality. In the winter, it may take a few hours or a day to clear the roads for travel after a snow-storm, but it rarely takes much longer.\n\nThere is a small airport near Andrews, North Carolina (about 15 miles) that is being expanded to handle commuter jets and is perfectly suited to smaller private planes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nYou will need a car or truck to get around Murphy.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nIn the fall, you will enjoy seeing mile after mile of spectacular autumn leaves and Murphy is a popular destination for leaf watchers.\n\nOn Hwy 294, west of Murphy, you can see the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Fields of the Wood"]},", which has one of the largest Ten Commandments in the world.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Not to Miss:"]},"\n\nMurphy hosts a huge flea-market in Downtown Murphy (500 Hiwassee Street) every Tuesday which starts early and ends a little after noon.
