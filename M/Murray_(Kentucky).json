Apart from the university, two of the major industries here are Briggs and Stratton, which makes small engines and Pella, manufacturing fine windows & doors. There are over a dozen smaller companies located in the community. However, the city is dominated by Murray State University. The inventor of radio, Nathan B. Stubblefield, was a native of Calloway County. The first demonstration of radio was held on the courthouse square in Murray in 1902.

While this may seem a bit antiquated, it's better than the alternative. Under the previous law, there were no \"bars\" per se, as any establishment wishing to sell alcohol had to seat at least 100 & derive 70% of its income from food.\n\nOn July 17, 2012, Murray voted itself completely \"wet\". Due to waiting periods required under state law, package liquor sales will not be allowed until the fall, most likely October. Package beer sales can begin once the city passes a governing ordinance, which should take place within the next month. It remains to be seen whether beer in restaurants will be as cheap as it was under the old law.\n\nSeveral local restaurants (Big Apple, The Keg, El Mariachi Loco....) that had licenses to sell by the drink under the previous law will still be happy to help you quench your thirst. With the new law, bars will soon be able to open, and smaller restaurants that couldn't get alcohol licenses can now apply for them.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Americas Best Value Inn"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.americasbestvalueinn.com\/bestv.cfm?idp=1951"],["email="],["address=517 S 12th St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 270 753-6706"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Best Western University Inn"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/book.bestwestern.com\/bestwestern\/US\/KY\/Murray-hotels\/BEST-WESTERN-University-Inn\/Hotel-Overview.do?propertyCode=18094&group=&srcPage=SelectHotel&isMapOpen=false&selectedHotels="],["email="],["address=1503 N 12th St  Murray, Kentucky, 42071-3534"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 270 753-5353"],["tollfree=+1 800 856-2485"],["fax="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name= Hampton Inn and Suites"],["url= http:\/\/hamptoninn3.hilton.com\/en\/hotels\/kentucky\/hampton-inn-and-suites-murray-PAHMYHX\/index.html"],["email="],["address=1415 Lowes Dr"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 270-767-2226"],["tollfree="],["fax=+1 270-767-2220"],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["wikipedia="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name= Kentucky Beach Resort"],["url= http:\/\/www.kentuckybeachresort.com\/"],["email= kybeach@wk.net"],["address=270 Lynnhurst Dr"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 270-436-2345"],["tollfree=+1 888-BIG-BASS"],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["wikipedia="],["content= Resort featuring cabins, condos, and motel rooms."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Quality Inn"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.qualityinn.com\/hotel-murray-kentucky-KY259?listpos=2"],["email="],["address=1210 N 12th St. , Murray, KY, US, 42071"],["lat=36.629456"],["long=-88.31208"],["directions="],["phone=+1 270 759-5910"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nJust a few miles away is the beautiful ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area"]]},", (situated between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kentucky Lake"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lake Barkley"]]},") which annually draws multitudes of sportsman & vacationers from all around the country.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=US 641.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["directionl1=N"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gilbertsville"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Benton (Kentucky)"],["Benton"]]}],["directionr1=S"],["majorr1=Jct ",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:I-40.svg"],["18px"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Paris (Tennessee)"],["Paris"]]}],["image2=Elongated circle 80.svg"],["imagesize2=22"],["directionl2=W"],["majorl2=Jct ",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Elongated circle 58.svg"],["18px"]]}],["minorl2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mayfield (Kentucky)"],["Mayfield"]]}],["directionr2=E"],["majorr2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bowling Green (Kentucky)"],["Bowling Green"]]}],["minorr2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Aurora (Kentucky)"],["Aurora"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["36.609444"],["-88.315556"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Western Waterlands"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Murray, Kentucky"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North America\/United States\/Kentucky\/Localities\/M\/Murray\/"]]}]
