Connected to the gardens is the Lowcountry Zoo, where you can see alligators, otters, foxes, and deer in naturalistic exhibits built into the swampland, as well as get (very) up-close with birds in a couple of aviaries. Additionally, there are historical exhibits, a playground with structures based on fairy tales, a butterfly house (extra admission required), sculpture pavilions, and a lake where you can take boat rides (extra admission required). A warning, however: the historical exhibits, particularly the movie that plays in the welcome center, have a habit of glorifying the plantation culture that was once here, so you might want to skip the movie and just get out into the gardens."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Huntington Beach State Park"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.southcarolinaparks.com\/huntingtonbeach\/introduction.aspx"],["email="],["address=16148 Ocean Hwy"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=off of US 17 south of town"],["phone=+1 843 237-4440"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Park opens at 6AM, closing times vary but are generally an hour or two after sunset; Atalaya open 9AM-5PM daily, year-round"],["price=$5 adult, $3 youth, free for children under 6; admission to Atalaya is an additional $2"],["content=A splendid place for nature lovers, Huntington Beach is a large state park that preserves a three-mile stretch of pleasant sandy beach, one of the few remaining undeveloped stretches of shoreline in the area and a scenic and much quieter alternative for beach-goers and surf fishers.
