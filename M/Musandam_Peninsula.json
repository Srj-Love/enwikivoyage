Some Bedouin communities are still today closed for non-Omanis. The highest mountain is Jebel Al Harim with an altitude of 2,087 meters above sea level. Most of the roads are still gravel\/dirty roads and only the major highway from the UAE border to Khasab is perfectly built for the increasing traffic. \n\nOmanis in the region have for centuries developed close trading ties with Iran. The Iranian city ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bandar Abbas"]]}," is just 65 km or 1.5 hours by boat across the Strait of Hormuz. Locally Khasab is known for the smuggling by Iranians in and out of Musandam. The trading is only illegal for the Iranian traders as Oman has a free trade zone and regulates the trade in its port. Today Iranians in general sell cattle (sheep\/goats), spices and other agricultural goods in exchange for TV sets, computers and other electronic goods. You can watch the trade in Khasab harbour without major restrictions.\n\nTourism has become important since the construction of the Khasab Road to the UAE border. The tourist season runs from late October until April. The tourist swell is usually limited to the weekend (Thu-Sat), when UAE residents arrive with their families. During these days, reserve hotels and tours in advance to avoid problems. Also when cruise ships arrive in Khasab, facilities like transport will be stretched to the maximum.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nArabic is the national language and is spoken by locals. The tourism industry depends on migrant workers who speak English with a varying degree of proficiency and dialect. Most Omanis in Musandam only speak limited English and you need to speak basic Arabic to get by in every place outside of Khasab.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Khasab Road.JPG"],["thumb"],["View of the Khasab Road close to Al Darah border post"]]},"\n\nThe main road access is from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ras Al Khaymah"]]}," on the road E-11 (after Al Darah border called Khasab Road) and with more difficulty from the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dibba (Musandam Peninsula)"],["Dibba"]]}," border of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fujairah"]]}," in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United Arab Emirates"]]},". The E-11 road from Ras Al Khaymah is well sign posted to the Omani border but slow due to many construction sites. There are also major construction works directly on the Omani side of the border, so expect loads of trucks. From Dubai, drive the E-311 to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ras Al Khaymah"],["RAK"]]}," and change on the E-11 road. The whole trip should be done in about 2 - 2.5 hrs depending on the traffic within RAK.\n\nOman Airlines has regular flights from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Muscat"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Khasab"]]},". During peak holiday seasons, Emirates and other Gulf airlines offer charter flights from Dubai to Khasab.\n\nAn entry visa is required if you are entering from the United Arab Emirates. The emigration offices on both sides of the border are painfully slow and require travellers to fill out forms. The process to get a UAE exit and Omani entry visa usually requires 30-60 minutes on normal days but during holiday season in the United Arab Emirates, it can take up to four hours. If possible, team up, so that one person queues while the other fills out the immigration forms (each for every person!). Also note that only the Omani immigration building offers restrooms. If you travel with a group (party of six or more) then the driver might receive a token that you have to hand over at the last border check to do a quick head count. Don't leave without handing it over to the border police.\n\nThe Omani visa costs 20 Rials \/ 200 Dirhams for most nationalities and can be bought directly at the border. The entry visa to Musandam is free for ten days if you have already entered the UAE on a tourist visa. Non-GCC UAE Residents have different rules depending on their nationality. Diplomatic or service staff residing in the UAE need to check individually but in general need a visa in advance.\n\nIf you use a private vehicle, Omani insurance is required and strictly controlled. Ensure that you have a written confirmation; otherwise, you have to buy insurance at an inflated price at the border. Rental vehicles will need a written insurance confirmation, so make sure to check before you go.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nPublic transport within Musandam doesn't exist. You will need a four-wheel drive vehicle if you intend to see more than Khasab. Be sure to have spare water and tires with you if you intend to drive to Jebel Al Harim, the Arabian Sea beaches or destinations farther off the beaten track, as absolutely no facilities are along the road. Even if the altitude is high, the heat, dust and gravel will test your vehicle. Along the roads to popular sites are military installations that are regularly used by the Omani army forces for training purposes. Military vehicles have priority, so give way and don't photo\/film them as this is strictly forbidden.\n\nFuel is very cheap in Musandam. Currently a litre of gas (95\/98 octane) costs close to 0.5 rial (25 Euro cent\/litre), which is cheap even for the UAE. Therefore, lots of UAE travellers fuel their cars at Musandam petrol stations, and queues at the start and end of the weekend might require a 10-15 minute wait.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Tibat Fort 01.jpg"],["thumb"],["Bukha Fort"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Jebal Harim.JPG"],["thumb"],["View of Jebal Harim from the Green Valley"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Musandam fjord view.JPG"],["thumb"],["Picture shows a fjord on the Musandam peninsula facing the Arabian Sea"]]},"\nBarren mountains that rise up to 2,000 metres or 6,500 feet above sea level jut out like fingers into the sea, creating countless fjord-like inlets and yield spectacular views.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Village of Tawi Rock Paintings"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat=26.17750"],["long=56.21785"],["directions=Wadi Quida"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=The new road allows access to Tawi where you can visit some prehistoric drawings and rock engravings of boats, animals and warriors."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Bukha Fort"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address=Khasab Coastal Rd, Bukha"],["lat=26.14478"],["long=56.15347"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["image=Tibat Fort 01.jpg"],["hours=Sa-Th 9am-4pm, F 9am-11am"],["price="],["content=Built in the 17th century and restored in 1990, its rounded pear-shaped watchtower is particularly notable."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Mountains"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Starting from the principal town of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Khasab"]]},", a graded road straddles a ridge, high above valleys on either side.

Today most of the fish is sold in Dubai as prices are about double those in Khasab. Local goat and lamb are also very popular on the grill as kebab or racks. Due to the big labour migration from India, Pakistan and the Philippines, several traditional dishes of South Asia are known and served as well.

If you want more than beer (mostly cans), basic red or white wines and spirits then you will need to bring it with you. Your main hassle will be to bring the alcohol from UAE to Musandam as the UAE highway crosses some dry Emirates (e.g. Sharjah) where alcohol is strictly prohibited.

There are two main risks:\n\n# Traffic: The roads are steep, corners are narrow and the drivers are reckless. Don't overtake without a clear view, during the night expect cars without lights on both sides of the road as well as cattle. Only the road from the UAE border to Khasab road has street lights, but it also has speeding drivers\n# Dehydration: Musandam is very hot, dusty and lacks (drinkable) water.

Ensure that you are able to use it in case of emergency. With an UAE SIM card roaming is significantly cheaper than with other international cards. Internet cafes are limited as almost everyone uses mobile Internet.\n\nNon-bottled water in general is collected as rain water in reservoirs and might taste foul\/dusty and might be for foreigners a bit difficult to swallow. It's safe to drink but bottled water might be the preferred choice for visitors.\n\nDon't photograph public buildings or military installations. Musandam is on the front line to the Strait of Hormuz and Iran. Omani army forces regularly train in the area and all cameras, smartphones, etc. will be confiscated if seen to try to take photos of sensitive structures. For religious reasons, many people - especially women and elderly people - don't like photos taken of them. Always ask explicit permission to photograph before you raise your camera. Iranians in the Khasab harbour don't like direct face shoots as they are smuggling into Iran which involves risks to their lives.\n\nWomen should be reluctant to initiate handshakes with male Omanis. Some might not feel initially comfortable to shake hands with foreign women. Please be defensive and start communication first to get a reaction. Omanis are very hospitable, but Western standards have been only introduced to them for a couple of years and most only very rarely encounter travellers. Women don't need to wear a niqab but should cover their shoulders and knees during visits of public buildings and remote villages.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Muscat"]]}]}," - Capital of Oman and just a short flight or a five hour boat trip"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Dubai"]]}]}," - Glittering city, seemingly centuries away from the culture of Musandam"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Ra's al Khaymah"]]}]}," - Closest bigger international airport and neighboring Emirate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["guideregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["25.95365"],["56.27262"],["zoom=10"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Musandam Governorate"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Northern Oman"]]}]
