The town lays claim to being the oldest in Scotland, and has certainly been inhabited for many thousands of years, due to its strategic location where the River Esk flows into the Firth of Forth. Although the town centres are 6 miles apart, the Western edge of Musselburgh meets the Eastern edge of Edinburgh at Eastfield, forming a continuous conurbation.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Bus"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.lothianbuses.com\/ Lothian Buses"]}]}," services 15, 26 and 44 serve Musselburgh from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Edinburgh"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Rail"]},"\n\nMusselburgh is served by ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.firstgroup.com\/scotrail\/ First Scotrail"]}]}," services to and from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Edinburgh"]]}," Waverley and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Berwick"]]},".
