Commanding a wonderful view of extensive Himalyan snow ranges to the northeast, & glittering views of the Doon Valley, Roorkee, Saharanpur & Haridwar to the South, the town presents a fairyland atmosphere to the tourists. Its history dates back to 1827 when Captain Young, an adventurous military officer, explored the present site & laid the foundation of this holiday resort which now has few rivals. Mussoorie is famous for its scenic beauty and hectic social life.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nAt an altitude of over 6000 ft (2000m), Mussoorie is a popular retreat from the heat of the plains.  Be prepared for the cold if you come in the Winter (Dec-Feb), when you can expect freezing weather and snow. The monsoon arrives in July and stays through mid-September.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By bus "]},"\nBuses leave from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dehradun"]]}," train station.  There are two buses which go to opposite ends of the Mussoorie Mall, Library and Picture Palace.  It is quite a hike from one to the other, so make sure you catch the right one.\nTo reach Kempty Falls directly from Dehra Dun catch a bus from the Dehra Dun Railway station Hill Bus Services Section or take a taxi. One should look for buses heading for destinations like Barkot, Nainbagh, Yamunotri, and Purola (Caution:sometimes Purola buses go via Vikas nagar which may take you off the route completely so be careful).\nYou can also take a bus to the Library end of Mussoorie and walk to the Kempty Bus stop and take a bus or taxi or a milkvan or even hitch a ride with a tourist going in that direction!! Bus fee for Library end or Kulri end (from Dehradun) is INR47.\nToll Tax is payable on entering Kempty Village per bus\/taxi\/car\/scooter. Bus fare from library end to kempty is around INR15.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By taxi "]},"\nIt is possible to hire a taxi for the trip up to Mussoorie.  Rates are Rs 610 per taxi and Rs 50 extra for the night charges but one can pay per seat as well in a shared taxi which normally accommodates up to five passengers.Shared or chartered taxis too are available near the same Hill Section Bus terminal and the rates are controlled by the taxi union. These rates are generally displayed on a board outside their office.\n\nMussoorie is just 38 km from Dehradun and one can reach here by taxis and buses. It takes approximately one and a half hour and Rs 47 for the regular buses to reach Mussoorie. From the Dehradun railway station, taxis charge around Rs 610. Shared taxis charging a little over Rs 100 per person are also available.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get around "]},"\n\nOnce in Mussoorie, the affordable and effective way to get around the city is to opt for bus system or cycle rickshaws. Cycle rickshaws for traveling within city may cost approximately Rs 20. However, it may get crowded, especially during peak hours. For most part you will want to get around on foot.  The Mall is closed to most vehicles.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By rickshaw "]},"\n\nA relatively flat section of the Mall allows a fleet of rickshaws to ply their trade.  You can catch a ride from the Library end of the Mall to about the midpoint.\n\nA full day Mussoorie sightseeing by rickshaw is less costly as compared to private cabs or taxis. But it is time consuming too. So taxis are preferable if you are in hurry but be ready to pay some extra money.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By taxi "]},"\nWithin Mussoorie, taxis are not very useful.  If you are heading up to Landour with your luggage, it would be wise to catch a ride.  They can also be hired for outings to places such as Kempty Falls or Happy Valley.  There are taxi stands at both ends of the Mall.  Many locals offer 'taxi' services, and if you are staying longer you will likely find these (slightly cheaper) alternatives. But all the taxies are under a union,so the rates will not vary and one has to hire them through the union office at library end, mall road, kempty bus stand etc.\nOne can also rent a private car which will be a little costly but less time consuming. A complete day of sightseeing around the city by taxi including Dhanoltri and Kempty Falls cost more than Rs 1800.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Lal Tibba"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat=30.4667435"],["long=78.0950534"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=A scenic 5 km uphill walk from Picture Palace to the highest point in Mussoorie.
