Several of the country's important wine 'companies' are based in the region but mostly the land is owned by locals who just enjoy producing wine as a hobby.  The area outside the four main towns is dotted with small settlements composed entirely of wine cellars that locals use as a weekend getaway to relax and work in their private vineyards.  Needless to say, the locals are more than enthusiastic to share the fruits of their hard labor with just about every passing individual.\n\nAlthough the wine industry is flourishing, almost no other section of the economy around ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mutěnice"]}," is growing.  In addition to being fertile land for wine, there was a lot of mining activity under communism, all of which came to a grinding halt during privatization.  This has the left the region with an unemployment rate of almost 20%.
