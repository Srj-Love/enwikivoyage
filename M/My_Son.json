Influenced by Hinduism, the Champas built temple complexes in Central Vietnam. (Best-known and preserved temple still in daily use by Buddhists is the Po Nagar Cham Tower in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nha Trang"]]},".) The temples of My Son were the most important temples of the Champa Kingdom.  Bricks were used to build the temples — without the aid of mortar — and sculptures of gods, priests, animals, and scenes of mythical battles and devotion adorned the walls. These temples were places of worship of Lord Vishnu.  \n\nAfter the fall of the Champa, the jungle began to reclaim the area. The temples had already fallen into disrepair by the 1960s, when the Viet Cong used My Son as a base. An act of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United States"],["U.S."]]}," Congress prohibited bombing of My Son during the war.\n\nMy Son was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999. There are travel guides that compare My Son with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Angkor Wat"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bagan"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Borobudur"]]},". Historically, they have a point: in their time, these complexes were leading spiritual centres, and they have all fallen into a state of ruin. However, the ruins at My Son are not as impressive as any of the other sites, for various reasons: the smaller scale of the original site, for example, the comparatively poor upkeep and severe damage to the buildings from time and war. Even so, these are unique and important historical sites, and the gorgeous jungle scenery alone may be worth the trip.\n\nThe best time of the day is to visit My Son is early in the morning or late afternoon when there are few tourists.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nMy Son, being a UNESCO site, has an admission charge of 100,000 dong (USD5) (Feb 2014) applicable regardless of how you get there.\n\nTo travel the 43 km (26 mi) to My Son from Hoi An you have several options:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Take a motorbike taxi"]},".

In the town, you'll see a big sign for My Son posted on a lamp post. Turn right there. From there, keep following the signs for 30 km (19 mi) until you reach the entrance for My Son.

The curators have made the odd (and maddening) decision to remove virtually all of the better-preserved sculptures from the ruins and display them here or at the small museum in Group A instead of in context with the temples where they belonged. Accordingly, try to visit the museum briefly before visiting the temples themselves. It closes a half-hour before everything else, so you might not be able to catch it on the way out.  \n\nThe temples are in varying states of (dis)repair, with restoration still underway on some. There are nine \"groups\", labeled A-G. Effectively, there are three major sites: A, B-C-D, and E-F. The G, H and L ruins are separate and a little trickier to find. If you can't find them, don't spend all day trying; they're much smaller than the rest. All of the sites are connected by reasonably well-labelled walking tracks.\n\nThe layout of the temples is dictated by the rays of the sun and in the early morning this is clearly evident. The early morning sunlight shines behind the head of Lord Vishnu from where it is scattered throughout. \n\nThere are ",{"type":"'''","value":["traditional dancing displays"]}," at 09:45 (daily except Mondays) for the benefit of tour groups.
