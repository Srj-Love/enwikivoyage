The price of accommodation varies greatly according to season. Mentioned from-prices are for low season. Expect prices to double in high season. Mykonos becomes overcrowded from mid July to the end of August, so be sure you have a room waiting if you go during that period. Beware that every year a lot of Greek tourist visit Mykonos around the weekend of Pentecost, which is at movable dates but in 2012 will be at the 3rd and 4th of June.\nMost of the hotels will close at the end of October and will open again at the end of April or the beginning of May.\n\nA lot of the locals rent ",{"type":"'''","value":["rooms"]}," and they will be waiting for you when you arrive at the port or the airport, waving pictures of their rooms. They will be there in peak season as well. Most of them are from small establishments that aren't listed on the internet. If approached to let a room, make sure you don't end up in an isolated apartment up on the hills around the town. Outside high season it is also easy enough to look around in Mykonos Town for yourself. There are 'rooms' signs everywhere. Wandering around with a suitcase or backpack you will be approached.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Mykonos Hoteliers Association"],["url=http:\/\/www.mha.gr\/"],["email=mykhotels@otenet.gr"],["address=Mykonos Town"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=near the old port, a white building with a sign 'hotel info reservations' above the entrance"],["phone=+30 22890 24540"],["tollfree="],["fax=+30 22890 24760"],["hours=From 8AM till midnight"],["price="],["content=At the Mykonos Hoteliers Association you can book a room on the spot (no bookings in advance).

For one euro you can call for about 45 minutes, so buy a card in the cheapest value (which is about 3 euros).  Calling someone for half an hour  is cheaper than sending one email from an internet café. Cards expire usually 90 days after first use.\nYou can use this pre-paid calling card also at public phone boxes, which are widely available in Mykonos Town, though there are a lot of broken phone boxes as well.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Internet"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Angelo's Internet Cafe"],["url="],["email=mycnetcafe@otenet.gr"],["address=Mykonos Town"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=on the road between the southern bus station and the windmills"],["phone=+30 22890 24106"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=€ 1 per 15 minutes"],["content=Mykonos' most popular internet cafe."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Net+Plus Internet Cafe"],["url="],["email="],["address=Enoplon Dynameon Street, Mykonos Town"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+30 22890 28617"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nMykonos is generally a safe island, with the only problem of dangerous and drunk driving.
