The Wodeyars had substantial internal autonomy and the princely state of Mysore (which comprised a large portion of present-day Karnataka) was probably the best administered in India. After independence, the state was merged back to the Indian Union and the capital of Mysore state was shifted to nearby ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bangalore"]]}," where the British maintained their army.  The name of the state too was eventually changed to the more accurate \"Karnataka\" in 1973.\n\nThe dynasty is still well-loved and the people of Mysore are still nostalgic for the grandeur of the earlier times. The palaces built by the Wodeyars and the yearly celebration of Dusshera are holdovers of that period.\n\nMysore has evolved from being a quiet and sleepy city, to a city that is touted to being the most important one in the state after Bangalore. With apartment complexes, supermarkets, a couple of proposed malls, new and improved roads, the advent of IT and BPO firms and a growing young and dynamic workforce, this regal city is trying to strike a balance between the good old days while  to keep up pace with the changes affecting it.\n\nA city that is old, yet new.

But, if you are planning to take a late night stroll, it is recommended that you keep watch, since a few incidents of Chain\/Purse snatching are reported every month. It is advised to be watchful when taking an Auto-Rickshaw during late nights if you are alone. It also advised to be careful in dealing the amount of money paid to the Auto-Rickshaw drivers as they try to tout and overcharge and refuse to use the meters in certain areas and at certain hours. Hired taxi services also available now in Mysore.\n\nThe police are generally friendly and ready to help. Don’t hesitate to ask for help. You can reach the police control room by dialing 100 from land line telephone booth or by dialing 108 if you have access to a cell phone.\n\nPeople in Mysore are generally hospitable, peace loving and ready to help. Mysore is one of the places in India where foreigners can stay and move around with relative ease and not be swarmed by people offering various services as it happens in other cities.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Bangalore"]]}," - ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Karnataka"]]}," state capital"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Bylakupee"]]}," - The largest Tibetan settlement outside of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tibet"]]},"."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Ooty"]]}," - hill station resort"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Tala Cauvery (Coorg Region) - The source of the River Cauvery"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Kabini reservoir and Game lodge"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Bandipur and Nagarahole Forest Safari"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Srirangapatna"]]}," - Tippu Sultan's summer palace, Tippu Drop and the nearby ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary"]]},"."]},{"type":"*","value":[" The Keshava temple of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Somanathapura"]]},"."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Kokkare Bellur"]]}," - A small village and a bird sanctuary."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shivanasamudram"]]}," - Twin falls formed by ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cauvery river"]]}," and place of Hydroelectric power plant."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Coorg: A pleasant hill station with two beautiful places to stay in, Orange County & Club mahindra's RCI Gold crown resort."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wayanad"]]}," - A scenic district in Kerala about 140 km away.
