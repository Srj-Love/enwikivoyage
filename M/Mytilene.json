The channel was later filled, thereby joining the islet to the larger island. The south harbour is the main harbour, protected by a long pier; it has an outer part containing the marina and commercial port on one side and the ferry port at the other side, with in between an almost circular small inner harbour whose waterfront is formed by P.
