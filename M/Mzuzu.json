One of the scam artists even has an office in the main transit area in Mbeya. He also has professional looking lists of prices, services, etc. He may even use a cell phone to check availability of seats for you. As of September 2008 there were no buses running from Mbeya to Mzuzu or any other town on the Malawi border. \n\nInstead, to get to Mzuzu from Mbeya, take a minibus to the border town of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kyela"]]},", Tanzania. Then walk 5 to 10 minutes across the border to the Malawi side. After the border, it's necessary to get to the transit center of a small town called ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Karonga"]]},".   There may be minibuses at the border, but they are infrequent.  A taxi can be hired for about $15USD.

Inside the fence you will find a beautiful garden with tables interspersed throughout. The food is typical Malawian restaurant fare, including nsima or rice with your choice of meats or relishes. A bit of a beer den at night, it seems.\n\nThere is also a pizzeria near the bus station on a side street serving decent thin crust pizzas cooked in a wood fired oven. It is run by an extremely entertaining couple named Paolo and Emanuelle.
