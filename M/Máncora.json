Have extra care, especially under the influence of drugs, alcohol and, or fatigue and lack of sleep.  Calm seas can hide strong currents, or seasonably develop dangerous tides and currents.\n\nStay within busy areas of the beach and town, preferably in good company, observing drug and alcohol intake especially when partying... Don't become an easy prey to predators of any kind. Don't flash any valuable stuff when taking a moto-taxi as long as some of the riders might be thieves. Be aware specially if you're carrying a bag with you.\n\nGood idea to stay away from illegal drugs in this town, as the dealers and police have been known to work together and will extort a hefty bribe if they even suspect something.\n\nUse skin protectors, sun glasses and hats.
