Here and there bits of ancient Maya stonework can be seen reused in Spanish Colonial era buildings in the old part of town.\n\nFrom the later 1800s to the 1920s, Mérida enjoyed prosperous boom times fueled by the henequen or sisal plant harvest, which made Yucatán the rope maker to the world.  Progressive Mérida had electric trams and street lights before Mexico City. The wealthy constructed the grand ",{"type":"''","value":["Pasejo Montejo"]}," avenue north of the old town, inspired by the Champs-Élysées in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Paris"]]},". With the development of artificial twines the sisal boom ended, and Mérida slowed to a more sleepy provincial capital until development picked back up in the late 20th century.\n\nThe city's ambiance is colonial and the climate is tropical. The daytime temperature varies; in January, it is about 75 degrees Fahrenheit (24 Celsius) and in June, about 95 F (35 C). To beat the heat, most people are busiest in the mornings. They have lunch and siesta, then go back to work for a few hours in the late afternoon. The cool breezes from the Gulf of Mexico drift into Mérida in the evenings and this is when many of the residents spend their time outdoors. You can see them visiting and talking as they stroll along the streets, sit in the plazas or dine in the many sidewalk restaurants.\n\nFrom Mérida, it is easy to take day trips to a vast array of destinations: archaeological sites, ecological parks, typical villages, caves, beaches, colonial missions and more. Take your time and  really explore the Maya sites… walk for miles along the Gulf of Mexico… attend a village festival… photograph the wildlife… crawl through a cave or swim in a cenote...\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Manuel Crescencio Rejón International Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["MID"]]},") with direct flights to Mexico City, Houston, Miami, Las Vegas and Europe.

There are about 4 bus stations in Mérida, so if coming from Mexico's TAPO station you need to ask to go to Meridas main terminal \"Merida CAME bus station\".\n\nIf coming from Cancun you can either choose to go to Meridas main terminal or the \"Hotel Fiesta Americana\" which drops of passengers coming from certain destinations and is only a short taxi ride to El Centro. If you decide on this stop you have all three ADO, ADO GL, or ADO Platino. ADO Platino being the highest class of service with free instant coffee packs in the back with hot water along with your choice to choose a single seat by yourself on the left side of the bus and TV's on the back of every seat allowing you to choose an array of movies and TV shows. Some even in English. These tickets will cost around 438 Pesos ($35.40 USD). ADO GL which is a step down without the extras but some more legroom that the regular ADO buses have will cost 322 Pesos ($26 USD) and finally the regular ADO buses are 268 Pesos (USD21.66). It's a four hour ride and the price difference isn't to wide. I personally always choose the ADO Platino when available.\n\nGoing to the Main \"CAME Central de Autobuses\" terminal your looking at around the same prices but it's located right in El Centro.

This makes it easy to tell how many blocks away from something you are (just remember to divide by two when counting blocks in the same direction). Addresses are commonly given as either intersections of two streets, or stated as on a street between two cross streets. For orientation in the old part of town, remember the Cathedral and Zocalo (main square) are at the corner of 60 and 61 (\"Calle 60 x 61\")\n\nIf staying in the older central part of town, many attractions, restaurants, etc. are within walking distance for those who don't much mind walking in the tropical climate.
