There is very limited public traffic (esp. at night), very few clubs and pubs, no arthouse cinemas, no \"scenes\" etc. The  metropolises of Cologne and Düsseldorf tend to cause a certain \"brain drain\" from MG so it appears to some as a kind of suburb to those - though again poorly connected in terms of public traffic.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nMönchengladbach has a bus system but it's weak.

On Fridays and Saturdays there is a Night Bus from the party area Alter Markt \/ Waldhausener Str. to the outskirts, but only until 3 am. You'll always find a taxi of course but they can be costly. Biking is advisable only from April to October, watch out for sudden weather changes.
