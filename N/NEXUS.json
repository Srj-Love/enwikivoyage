Members of the program can avoid long waits at border entry points by using self-serve kiosks at airports, reserved lanes at land crossings, or by phoning border officials when entering by water. The program is operated by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). A NEXUS membership card is a valid document under the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative.\n\nNEXUS is part of the Trusted Traveler Program.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Eligibility "]},"\nTo qualify for the program, an applicant must be a citizen of Canada or the United States, or a permanent resident.  Permanent residents must have resided in Canada or the U.S. for three years.  Applicants must also be legally admissible to both nations, have complied with immigration and customs regulations during previous travel, and pass a criminal history check.

The application fee is CAD 50."]},"\nOnce submitted, the application will be reviewed, and the applicant's criminal and immigration will be reviewed.  Making a false declaration on the application will result in the application being denied.  Once denied or conditionally approved, the applicant will be informed of the outcome.\n\nThe processing time for an application varies based on the volume of applications.  As of January 2013, the wait is approximately 3 weeks.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Scheduling an interview "]},"\nIf the application is conditionally approved, the applicant must schedule an interview within 30 days.  If an interview is not scheduled within this time, the application may be cancelled.  Instructions on how to schedule an interview are included in the letter of conditional approval.\n\nThe interview does not need to occur within 30 days of the notification of conditional approval; it is only necessary to schedule the interview within 30 days.  For example, if conditional approval is granted on March 1, the applicant must book an interview slot by March 30; however, the interview could possibly be scheduled several weeks or months later.\n\nDepending on the current load, interviews may not be available for several months at the candidate's desired enrolment centre.  If there is no suitable time slot available in the near future, the applicant can consider one of the following options: \n",{"type":"*","value":[" Book an interview regardless.

This will allow them to be interviewed as a group.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Interview "]},"\nThe letter of conditional approval will include a list of documents that must be brought to the interview.

Each officer will explain the rules of the program and ask a series of questions.  Questions may include:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Reason for travel"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Citizenship, permanent residence, or visa status"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Verification of answers on the application"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Criminal or immigration history"]},"\nThe CBP officer will fingerprint and photograph the candidate, and the CBSA officer will perform an iris scan of the candidate (where available).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Receipt of NEXUS card "]},"\nFollowing the interview (often within one-to-two days), the applicant will be notified of whether or not the application was approved.  A card will be mailed within two weeks.  The applicant must activate the card on the GOES website.  Once activated, the applicant may use NEXUS to cross the border.\n\nIf the candidate's profile in GOES indicates that they are eligible to use Global Entry, they may begin using the Global Entry kiosks in designated airports right away, even without a NEXUS card.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Iris scan "]},"\nAn iris scan must be performed in order to use a NEXUS machine at designated airports.  However, it is not required to cross by land or sea, nor is it required to use a Global Entry kiosk at designated airports.\n\nNot all enrolment centres have an iris scanner.  If the enrolment centre does not have an iris scan machine, a NEXUS member may visit another enrolment centre to have the iris scan performed.  The NEXUS member must have their card on-hand to complete the iris scan.\n\nNo interview is required for an iris scan, but it may be wise to call ahead to verify that the office is open and has capacity to perform an iris scan.  If there is no wait, the iris scan process typically takes less than 5 minutes.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Enrolment centres "]},"\nBelow is a list of enrolment centres.
