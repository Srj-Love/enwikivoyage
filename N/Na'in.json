Like much of the Iranian plateau, it has a desert climate, with a maximum temperature of 41°C in summer, and a minimum of -9°C in winter.\n\nMore than 3,000 years ago the Persians learned how to construct aqueducts underground (",{"type":"''","value":["qanat"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["kariz"]},") to bring water from the mountains to the plains. In the 1960's this ancient system provided more than 70 per cent of the water used in Iran and Na’in is one of the best places in all the world to see these qanats actually working as they were intended.\n\nUnique to Na’in are some of the most outstanding monuments in all of Iran: the Jame Mosque, one of the first four mosques built in Iran after the Arab invasion; the Pre-Islamic Narej Fortress; a Pirnia traditional house; the Old Bazaar; Rigareh, a qanat-based watermill; and a Zurkhaneh (a place for traditional sport).  \n\nBesides its magnificent monuments, Na’in is also famous for high-quality carpets and wool textiles.\n\nSome linguists believe the word Na’in may have been derived from the name of one of the descendants of the prophet Noah, who was called \"Naen\". Many local people speak an ancient Pahlavi Sasani dialect, the same dialect that is spoken by the Zoroastrians in Yazd today.

A 28 m tall octagonal minaret was added to the mosque almost 700 years ago.\n\nIf you stand in the middle of the yard, you will find yourself surrounded by fourteen columns, each one adorned with a unique and intricate pattern of brickwork.\n\nYou might also be interested in the alabaster stonework which reflects sunlight throughout the basement.\n\nOne of the most exquisite pieces of artwork inside the mosque is the wooden marquetry pulpit (Persian: ",{"type":"''","value":["menbar"]},").  The carpenter matched the wooden parts together like a pieces of a puzzle. The pulpit is decorated with organic geometrical designs. According to the wooden inscription on the left side of the pulpit, it was created about 700 years ago.\n\nAn underground water channel runs underneath the mosque. There is a stairway that connects the mosque to the water channel and to chambers above the pool. In the past, people used the water for ablutions before prayers.\n\nThe basement used to be a prayer chamber in hot summers and cold winters. The temperature in the basement is always moderate, never varying more than 10 to 15 degrees. The basement wasn’t actually built; instead it was dug into the ground, which means no materials were used to construct it.\n\nThe entrance fee is 50,000 rial.

The access corridor to the mill is about 133 m long.\n\nA qanat channel crosses 12 m above the mill and fills the huge 8 m diameter water tank. When enough pressure is provided, the water is released and rotates the turbine. The waste water flows out along the channel and joins the main qanat channel with a gradual slope 12 m further down. This is the only place in the country where visitors can get inside a living flowing Qanat accessible through a 12 m corridor.\n\nSince the advent of electricity to grind the wheat and barley, this water mill has become a part of history.

Then, during the Qajar Period, the house belonged to a governor of Na'in. Just a few decades ago, the house was purchased by the Ministry of Culture and Art. After renovation in 1994, the house was converted into the desert ethnology museum.\n\nThe entrance fee is 50,000 rial and the museum is open Tu-Su 08:00-21:00 in summer and 08:00-17:30 in winter.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Mosallah edifice"]}," \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Mosalla edifice.jpg"],["thumb"],["Mosalla edifice"]]},"\n\nThe Mosallah is another remarkable monument to see in Na'in.

The Mosallah is an octagonal mausoleum of dervishes and Qajar and Pahlavi political figures.\n\nIt is encompassed by a military fort from the Qajar era with a high wall thick enough for a horse to be ridden along the top.

However, it is thought to have been part of the military and official compounds of the city. Many researchers of the Safavid era have spoken of numerous castles known as Narikh Qalae, which were used for military purposes. Hence, it can be concluded that Naeen's Narikh Qalae was also a military establishment.

Evidence shows that they were dug by the Zoroastrian inhabitants who used to live there because the cave entrances open to the east where the sun rises.

There visitors can enjoy a beautiful perspective of the village and the desert around it. \n\nThere is no fee for visiting the caves or the fort.

Weaving carpets, a fine art, began in Na'in about the time of World War II.  Because carpet weavers from Na'in worked with thinner wools, they began to weave rugs of much higher quality. Since the number of carpets produced was low and the quality of carpets was exceptionally high, the weavers found a profitable market.\n\nCarpet-weaving in Na'in has a history of using non-Iranian wools and of using local, traditional designs with unique colouring, thus drawing the attention of the world market to Na'in.\n\nUsing natural and traditional colours and dying techniques peculiar to the region around Na'in, carpet weavers in Na'in can easily profess that they are some of the best producers of handwoven carpet in all of Iran and the world.\n\nNa'in style carpet is woven in different places in Iran - but the quality will be very different in each place. One reason that carpet actually woven in Na'in is so popular, is that it uses predominantly natural and traditional colours rather than synthetic dyes. Other reasons include the sheer quality of the weft obtained from using mainly wooden looms.\n\nThis all means that Na'in can easily claim that it is one of the best producers of hand woven carpets in all Iran.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Zurkhaneh"]}," \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Saheb A Zaman Club Zurkhaneh, Yazd, Iran (5072483704).jpg"],["thumb"]]},"\nZurkhaneh, Zorkhana or Zourkhaneh (in Persian\/Kurdish: زورخانه, literally \"house of strength\") is a sport with thousands of years of history that has played a great role in empowering the mental and physical health aspects of the Iranian people.
