Nago lies two kilometers north, and uphill, with a great view over ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lake Garda"]]},".\n\nTorbole is popular with families, windsurfers and cyclists. It is popular with windsurfers due to high-wind conditions at the northern end of the lake. There is a wide choice of hotels and camping sites. Sports on the lake are very popular with windsurfing being the most popular. The town itself has many attractive buildings in the traditional Italian style and beautiful floral displays. The culture is relaxed and friendly and the resort seems most popular with German and Austrian tourists due to its closeness to the Austrian border. The choice of restaurants and cafes is very good and most are very family friendly. There are many ice cream shops selling high quality Italian ice-cream, as in most of Italy. The local milkshakes are excellent along with the great variety of ice-cream flavours. The shops are mixed with high price sportswear shops and cheaper giftware shops. The town also has basic supermarkets and pharmacies.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Torbole alter Hafen.JPG"],["180px"],["thumb"],["Old port of Torbole"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Nago.JPG"],["180px"],["thumb"],["Nago from Castel Penede"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nYou can enter Nago-Torbole by car, but also by bus from Verona ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.gardasee.de\/download\/Aptv%20Linie%2062-64.pdf pdf"]},", or by ferry ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.navigazionelaghi.it\/eng\/g_crociere.asp"]}," from one of the other towns on the lake.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nYou don't need your own car.
