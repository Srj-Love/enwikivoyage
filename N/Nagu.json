It consists of two main islands and some 3000 minor ones.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nNagu is located in the middle of the Archipelago Sea, which has a great influence on the identity of locals, although the life in the main islands may look like in the countryside elsewhere. The fields are smaller, the shore is nearby and traditionally people have got their living in small pieces, such as from fishing, agriculture, sea fowl hunting – and seafaring.\n\nA large part of the outer archipelago, and thus of the Archipelago National Park, belongs to Nagu. Minor inhabited islands, often with one or a few families, are connected to the mainland with mostly daily ferry services – conditions permitting. Living there means a quite solitary life in winter, but in summer there are lots of tourists, summer guests and some locals who escape the dark months to apartments in towns. This is the paradise for yacht sailors, many making the journey from Helsinki and back every year, more than a hundred nautical miles each way.\n\nNagu and its surroundings are traditionally ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Swedish phrasebook"],["Swedish"]]}," speaking and still has a strong Swedish majority, while a quarter of the population and many summer cottage dwellers and visitors are ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Finnish phrasebook"],["Finnish"]]}," speaking. Service is usually available in both languages, as well as in English. The language in which businesses market themselves say little about their own language.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Landsvägsfärjan Sterna.jpg"],["thumb"],["Road ferry between Pargas and Nagu."]]},"\n\n",{"type":"''","value":["Skärgårdsvägen"]}," (\"the Archipelago road\", Finnish: ",{"type":"''","value":["Saaristotie"]},", regional road 180) starts in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kaarina"]]}," (Swedish: ",{"type":"''","value":["S:t Karins"]},") outside ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Turku"]]}," (Swedish: ",{"type":"''","value":["Åbo"]},") at national road 1 (part of E18)  from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Helsinki"]]}," (Swedish: ",{"type":"''","value":["Helsingfors"]},"). On its way out to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Korpo"]]}," (Finnish: ",{"type":"''","value":["Korppoo"]},") it connects the main islands of Nagu: Storlandet and Lillandet (and Biskopsö and Ernholm between them). There is a ferry connection from Prostvik in the east (on Nagu Lillandet) to Lillmälö in Pargas, mostly twice an hour, with a stop in the night. There are considerable queues when people head for their summer cottages or return, i.e. Friday and Sunday afternoons, respectively (sometimes for hours, with three ferries driving non-stop; there is a kiosk near the ferry pier). An other ferry goes from Pärnäs in the west (on Storlandet) to Korpo. The distance between Prostvik and Pärnäs is some 27 km, between Lillmälö ferry pier and Pargas centre some 17 km.\n\nFrom Galtby in Korpo there is a ferry connection to Långnäs in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Åland"]]},".\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["main village"]},", Kyrkbacken, is in the east end of Storlandet, some 14 km from Prostvik, 33 km from Pargas centre and 55 km from Turku. Like in many Finnish villages the view from the road is not too romantic: gas station and flat roofed grocery stores. Older houses are preserved e.g. on the way to the marina. The village is actually quite large, interspersed with woods.\n\nThere are ",{"type":"'''","value":["coaches"]}," from Turku (about 12€, children 4–11 half price) along Skärgårdsvägen, via Nagu to Korpo and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Houtskär"]]}," a few times a day, operated by ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.vainionliikenne.fi Vainion Liikenne"]}," (but usually in the white and green colours of Skärgårdsvägen Ab).

The complete route takes several hours. Most are there foremost to serve the local population and probably free (earlier free only to locals, but this made for too much bureaucracy), some are heavily subsidized and cheap, some are totally commercial.\n\nThe ship-like ferries part from Kyrkbacken or Pärnäs (14 km from Kyrkbacken), both on Skärgårdsvägen, or from Kirjais Österby (reachable by bike, car or ferry; 12 km from Skärgårdsvägen, 16 km from Kyrkbacken). Check whether you have to order the connection in advance (usually before 14 or 16 the preceding day) to have the ferry call at your pier, and make sure you are seen when you are to be fetched.\n\nNearly all ferries take bikes and most take a few cars (but there may be no parking lot or road to drive at the destination). Check separately for out of season; in winter there may even be hydrocopters or ice roads instead. Timetable information (Pargas tourist information) +358 400 117 123, info@pargas.fi.
