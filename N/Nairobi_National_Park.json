Located just 10 mins from the city centre off Langata Road,its ideal to get your first feel of what Kenya has to offer, or for those quick visits without the time to see the Mara, Serengeti, Amboseli, etc.,its the ideal park to visit.\nYou will be most comfortable in a four wheel drive, van, jeep, or truck, as the terrain remains natural and rough.  You can use a saloon,though it will most definitely be a rough drive.\nThere are many car hire firms that offer pick ups and drops in vans, coasting anything between Kshs 6000 to 15,000 per day.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Lodging"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Camping"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Backcountry"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Kenya"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinepark"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Nairobi National Park"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["-1.3733333333333"],["36.858888888889"]]}]
