Archaeological findings date back to the 4th century and the first mention of a stupa was in the year 675.\n\nWhile Nakhon Pathom was a prosperous city during the pre-Angkorian Dvaravati period; it was the Angkorian Empire that left a greater mark in the 11th century.

But the departure point from Victory Monument is hard to find, being located under the expressway, about 50 metres north of the roundabout, on Phahon Yothin Road (look up and around for the huge advertisement screen for the direction).
