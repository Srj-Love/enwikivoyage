It borders Lao PDR's Khamoun Province, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tha Khaek"]]}," District. Nakhon Phanom was the site of a US base during the Vietnam War, housing the 56th Air Commando Wing, based at Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base.  Its mission was search and rescue and interdiction of the Ho Chi Minh Trails in Laos 48 km to the east. \n\nThe city has a beautiful landscape, with the Mekong River running adjacent to the city, marking the current border between Thailand and Laos.\n\nThe population of Nakhon Phanom is a diverse mix of Thais, Thai-Vietnamese, Thai-Chinese, and  perhaps a few Thai-Indians. The main languages spoken are Thai, Isaan, and Vietnamese, Isaan being the most popular of them.  The primary culture is Lao, as Isaan was part of Laos until the late 19th century. Ho Chi Minh resided in a small village between the city center and the air base to the west during the late-1920s and early-1930s.  A new museum has been constructed there, his home is preserved and is open to the public, and it draws many Vietnamese tourists.\n\nAlthough a small town, Nakhon Phanom is famous for its centuries-old temples and beautiful landscape. The city has a reserved and traditional Isaan culture. A traveller may well find the residents of the city very hospitable and kind. The surrounding villages have many tribal cultures unique to Isaan and Laos.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By plane "]},"\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.nokair.com Nok Air"]}," operates flights to Nakhon Phanom (KOP), as does  ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.airasia.com Thai Air Asia"]},".
