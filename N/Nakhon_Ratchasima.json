Despite the size of the city, it is not a favoured holiday destination for the average foreign traveller.

It was just such a Laotian attack that was defeated by local heroine Thao Suranaree in 1826. She, and her army, are credited with freeing the city from King Anouvong's Laotian forces. These exploits have lifted 'Yamo' to almost god-like status in Korat. Her statue, in the centre of the city on Ratchadamnoen Rd, is the most visited attraction in the city.\n\nThe city continued to grow, helped by the arrival of the railway in the early twentieth century, and, today, is a typical Thai mix of chaos, pollution, and tradition.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh =   31"],["febhigh =   34"],["marhigh =   36"],["aprhigh =   37"],["mayhigh =   35"],["junhigh =   34"],["julhigh =   34"],["aughigh =   33"],["sephigh =   32"],["octhigh =   31"],["novhigh =   30"],["dechigh =   29"],["janlow =   18"],["feblow =   21"],["marlow =   23"],["aprlow =   25"],["maylow =   25"],["junlow =   25"],["jullow =   24"],["auglow =   24"],["seplow =   24"],["octlow =   23"],["novlow =   21"],["declow =   18"],["janprecip =  6"],["febprecip =  18"],["marprecip =  37"],["aprprecip =  64"],["mayprecip =  141"],["junprecip =  108"],["julprecip =  114"],["augprecip =  146"],["sepprecip =  222"],["octprecip =  143"],["novprecip =  27"],["decprecip =  18"],["description = Check ",{"type":"'''","value":["Nakhon Ratchasima's 7 day forecast"]}," at ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.tmd.go.th\/en\/province.php?id=20 TMD.go.th"]}]]},"\n\nKorat is classified as having the three tropical seasons of ",{"type":"''","value":["hot"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["rainy"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["cool"]}," (or sometimes ",{"type":"''","value":["dry"]},"). But the seasons overlap considerably, and the rainy and hot seasons occur almost simultaneously while the cool\/dry season is quite short. In generally during Nov, Dec, and Jan it's very dry and relatively cool, although daytime temperatures will still often exceed 30 degrees C. Mar-Jun are the four hottest months but there can be heavy rains during this time, particularly in May. The temperatures decreases slightly each month as the area moves into the rainy season. Aug-Oct are the wettest months but tropical storms may be experienced any time between Mar-Oct. The downpours end as Oct ends: the rainfall in Nov is just 20% that of Oct.\n\nThe city, with its traffic and concrete, will be a little hotter than the rest of the province. And days in Apr and May can be unbearably hot amidst the urban jungle. Conversely, it can be surprisingly cool between Nov-Jan. It's not unusual for temperatures at night in the city to drop below fifteen degrees Celsius in the cool season, while out in the rural areas, single-digit temperatures are not unknown.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Orientation "]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Downtown Korat.JPG"],["thumb"],["The Statue of Thao Suranaree (Yamo), Chomphon Gate and Chumphon Road behind, and a section of the moat to the right"]]},"\n\nThe main road into the city is Hwy 2 (Mittraphap Rd) which originates in Saraburi and terminates in Nong Khai. The mall, Tesco Lotus and several hotels are next to it. Shortly after the mall, it bears left, goes past the main bus station and onto Khon Kaen. To the north of the city it joins up with the bypass also known, somewhat confusingly, as Hwy 2.\n\nThe road network within the city is, for the most part, an American-style grid system. Therefore, once you are familiar with the place, it is easy to find your way around. But if you are new in town it can be a nightmare as every road looks the same. This is particularly the case in the moated historic centre of the city.\n\nThe moat encloses the original city, almost a perfect rectangle, one and a half km by one km,  and consists of seven main roads that run east to west: Phonsaen, Yommarat, Atsadang, Chomphon, Mahat Thai, Supphasit, and Kamheng-Songkhram, and six main roads that run north to south: Chumphon (not to be confused with Ch",{"type":"'''","value":["o"]},"mphon), Jagkree, Manat, Pratchak, Kudan, and Phonlan.\n\nThe English spelling of Thai words is an inexact science so don't be surprised to see variations on these spellings in different guide books, on maps and on street signs. For example, ",{"type":"''","value":["Jagkree"]}," is sometimes spelled ",{"type":"''","value":["Chakrii"]},"; ",{"type":"''","value":["Phonsaen"]}," can be ",{"type":"''","value":["Polsan"]},"; ",{"type":"''","value":["Chomphon"]}," can be ",{"type":"''","value":["Jompol"]},"; ",{"type":"''","value":["Supphasit"]}," may have no ",{"type":"''","value":["h"]},"; ",{"type":"''","value":["Atsadang"]}," may have double ",{"type":"''","value":["s"]}," and no ",{"type":"''","value":["t"]},"; ",{"type":"''","value":["Pratchak"]}," may have no ",{"type":"''","value":["t"]},", and so on.\n\nTo add to your confusion, the names of Jagkree Rd and Pratchak Rd change south of their intersections with Chomphon Rd: to Watchara Sarit Rd and Chai Narong Rd respectively.\n\nThe obvious geographical reference point for travellers is the statue of Thao Suranaree (or ",{"type":"''","value":["Yamo"]},"). Every tuk-tuk, motorbike taxi, songthaew and taxi driver will understand \"Yamo\" so you shouldn't have any problem getting there. She stands between Chumphon and Ratchadamnoen Rd. Both of these are one-way streets and from Ratchadamnoen you can catch songthaews to just about every part of the city. Ratchadamnoen ends where it meets Hwy 224. Turn left onto Hwy 224 and it becomes Hwy 2 (Mittraphap) after about a kilometre. Turn right, and Hwy 224 takes you east and then south towards Dan Kwian pottery village and Chok Chai. At Chok Chai (30 km south of the city) Hwy 224 crosses Hwy 24 which goes to Buriram, Surin, and Ubon Ratchathani.\n\nThree main roads lead off Ratchadamnoen: Chomsurangyat, Pho Klang and Suranaree. These are busy two-way thoroughfares and all three converge a kilometre and a half west of Yamo to form Mukmontri Rd which leads back to Hwy 2.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By car "]},"\n\nThere are three routes to take from Bangkok to Nakhon Ratchasima.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["First Route:"]}," Take Hwy 1 (Phahonyothin) passing Don Muang Airport, Wang Noi, and Nong Khae till you arrive at the Saraburi interchange.

All these services terminate and originate at the new bus station. The old bus station is used for some Bangkok services and shorter local routes to places such as Pak Chong and Pak Thong Chai.\n\nIf you've arrived at the new bus station all the usual Thai means of transport are available for you to get to where you want to go. Tuk-tuks, motorcycle taxis, and meter taxis (see ",{"type":"''","value":["Get around"]},") are in abundance at the bus station.

The fare from the main bus station to Yamo\/city centre is 60 baht. Agree on this price before you get in. Fares typically go up in multiples of 20 and start at 40 baht.\n\nRemember, this isn't a tourist city so your driver will not speak English.

Passengers step into the back of the truck and sit on parallel benches. When you want to get off just press the buzzer and hand your fare through the passenger window to the driver.\n\nYou can get on one anywhere by hailing it from the side of the road although there are official bus stops complete with signs displaying which number songthaew(s) stop there. They usually only stop when a passenger presses the buzzer or when a pedestrian hails one but there are a few locations where they will always stop such as mhe mall, Klang Plaza, and Big C.\n\nEach songthaew follows a fixed route (a different system to that which is used in Chiang Mai, for example) and there are around twenty different routes which cover most roads in the city. The vehicles come in a variety of colours and numbers, each denoting a different route. Most have their route number prominently displayed on a board above the window. Some start as early as 05:00 and run as late as 23:00, but generally speaking it is rare to see one before 07:00 and very rare to see one much after 21:00.\n\nFor the newcomer, using songthaews can seem quite daunting as nearly all the destinations are written in Thai (on the front and side of the vehicle) and you need to know that the songthaew you are getting on hasn't just stopped at the place where you want to go. For example, you might be waiting outside the front of the mall wanting to go to the zoo. Along comes a songthaew with 'Korat Zoo' written on the side.
