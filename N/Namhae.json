The largest of these is Namhae island which is connected to Hadong on the mainland by Namhae Bridge which was opened in 1973.  Modelled on the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, it is 660 m long and 80 m high.\n\nThe second largest island is Changsoen which is connected to the mainland by the Changsoen-Samchoenpo Bridge which was opened on April 28 2003. The bridge is really a series of 5 bridges spanning 3.4 km, stretching from Changsoen island then connecting 3 small islands - Neukdo, Choyang and Mogae - before reaching the mainland at Samchoenpo.\n\nThere are over 70 small unhabited islands within the county boundary with the majority of the 50,000 population living on the two main islands.  It is largely a farming community, growing rice and garlic (for which it is famous throughout Korea) and it has a small fishing industry.  It is also a popular holiday destination for Koreans who descend upon the beaches and mountain trails in July and August.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nThe Namhae Expressway runs east to west along the southern coast which connects to the main artery routes throughout the country.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nIntercity buses connect Namhae to most of Korea's major cities.
