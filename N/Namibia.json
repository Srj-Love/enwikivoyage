Since it was ruled under the apartheid system, Namibia also has many of the problems resulting from that system.\n\nIt is important to be aware that race is a common part of Namibian discourse. That is to say, Namibians will refer to the race of others more frequently than travellers from places where race is typically ",{"type":"''","value":["not"]}," an issue, would expect. Because of apartheid, race is an issue in many spheres of life, so it comes up a lot. In spite of this, the various races do get along well in Namibia, and it is fairly uncommon to find racial tensions flaring.\n\nNamibia is similar to South Africa, and if you're used to travelling in one country, travelling in the other country is quite easy. There are some subtle differences. For example, in South Africa a non-white person may choose to speak English rather than Afrikaans (as a political choice) whereas among Namibia's mixed-race population (who call themselves 'colored' in Namibia and South Africa) Afrikaans is a proud part of their culture, and many people still speak German.  Overlooking these differences isn't going to cause offense, but they're handy to know.\n\nThe public holidays in Namibia are:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=January 1"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content= New Year's Day"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=March 21"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Independence Day"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Easter weekend"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=(\"Good Friday\", \"Easter Saturday\", \"Easter Sunday\" and \"Easter Monday\"): a four day long weekend in March or April set according to the Western Christian dates."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=May 1"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Workers Day"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=May 4"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Cassinga Day"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=May 25"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Africa Day"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=August 26"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Heroes' Day"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=December 10"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Human Rights Day"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=December 25"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Christmas Day"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=December 26"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Day of Goodwill (Family Day)"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Regions"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Regionlist"],["regionmap=Namibia regions WV map.png"],["regionmaptext=Regions of Namibia"],["regionmapsize=500px"],["region1name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Caprivi"]]}],["region1color=#dd9fa5"],["region1items="],["region1description=The panhandle in the north-east of the country.
