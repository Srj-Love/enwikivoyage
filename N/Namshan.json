The region, and its capital, have declined economically since the abolition of the Sao Pha in 1952. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By road"]},"\nA rough ride from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hsipaw"]]}," on a very bad road (avoidable during the rainy season) is the only way to get to this village. The easiest is to ride pillion on a motorcycle (available in Hsipaw). The occasional truck that makes the journey may let you hitch a ride for a small fee.\n\nUpdate Jun 2012: Pickups go from Hsipaw to Namshan daily. Price: 6,000 kyat per person. It takes 6 hours to drive the 80 km. Ask at Mr Kid if you are staying there (Mr Charles apparently will tell you the only way to get there is to take a tour with his guesthouse).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe town is small and it is easy to walk everywhere, not that there is any other form of transport available.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["The Sao Pha palace"]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nTrekking, either from Namshan to Hsipaw (possible without a guide, ask for map at guesthouse) or in the mountains around Namshan with a guide.
