Most of the appeal of this island is due to its small secluded and relatively uninhabited nature, and as such there are not really any restaurants or businesses there. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nTravellers typically arrive there by chartering a local motorboat from the mainland; the nearest town is Rakiraki.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nA must to see is ONE BAY, a beautiful white sandy beach hidden from anyone.\nBehind this beach there's a tropical rain forest, in which lie an ancient Fijian village.\nAll over the Island there are many archeological sites, that are not been studied.\nWalking around the Island you can see burial sites.\nMe and one of my friend that lives on the island discovered an altar!!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Scuba diving"]}]},"Scuba diving around the island is amazing.\nThe Bligh Waters are famous for their colourful soft corals. You can't see everywhere else as many soft coral as in Nananu-I-Ra.\nThe most famous dive site it's called Golden Dream, it's a very colourful site that lies at a depth of 20m.\nThe Vatu-I-Ra passage iss famous for it's strong currents so each dive site on this strait is a drift dive. On this side, the most beautiful dive site is called Mary's Tag. It's a wall of corals that goes down to over 50m. Very strong current, so you must be prepared!\n\nAround the Island the visibility is very good especially from August to January.\nBut for me the best period of the year to dive here is from December to April-May, when the visibility still pretty, but the water is so warmer (28-29 CÂ°)!\n\nOn the Island at this moment there are 2 dive shops.\n\nEnjoy your stay in Nananu!\n\n ",{"type":"'''","value":["Sea kayaking"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Nananu-i-Ra"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["-17.3000"],["178.2167"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Viti Levu"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]}]
