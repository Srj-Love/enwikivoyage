The taxi fare in Nanchang is also cheap compared to other cities in China with same scale and the initial starting price for a ride on taxi is ¥6 up to 2 kilometers. Beyond this mandatory starting-price-region, the rate is ¥1.9 per kilometer. It should also be noted that the taxi fare has an additional 20% surcharge in the nocturnal time period between 11:00pm and 5:00am to compensate for the low demand at night. However you will probably find that during peak times both buses\/taxis are nearly impossible, at which point either walking or cycling are the only options (there is nowhere to rent bikes in Nanchang).\n\nIf visiting during the summer a bicycle is a good investment, at ¥110 from WalMart beside Bayi Square.
