It has many historical sites including Ming tombs that are on the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["UNESCO World Heritage List"]]},". It was most recently the capital of China under the Kuomintang, from 1927 until their retreat to Taiwan in 1949.

There is also a nighttime flight every day from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai Pudong International Airport"]]}," primarily aimed at connecting international travelers. \n\nFrom the airport, there are several ground transportation options into Nanjing. The 30-minute taxi ride to the downtown area will cost ¥100 or more (there's a ¥20 toll about 3 km away from the airport). It usually works out cheaper to take the airport shuttle bus to downtown and take a taxi from there.\n\nThere are two express-bus routes from the airport to downtown Nanjing - both terminate at the railway station and connect with the subway and local city buses. The services run at 15-minute intervals with one line serving Zhonghuamen (also has good subway and bus connections) and Hanzhongmen, while the other runs to the east of the city and stops close to Fuzimiao. A one-way ticket costs ¥20 and can be purchased from the kiosk outside the arrivals hall.\n\nWARNING - if taking the bus to the airport from Zhonghuamen, ignore the touts who hang around outside the bus station and subway station claiming to operate the official bus service - they will usually quote the same price, you'll be loaded into the back of a small, run-down minibus and will usually drop you off several kilometres short of the airport and claim that the fare into the actual airport is several hundred yuan. To find the actual bus service, enter the bus station building and go to Gate 7 - buy the ticket from the kiosk at the gate, not the main ticket office.\n\nIf you're flying into ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai"]]}," then there are bus and train services that travel to and from Nanjing. The bus runs four times a day from both Shanghai airports; it starts at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai Pudong International Airport"]]},", makes a stop at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai#Shanghai_Hongqiao_International_Airport"],["Hongqiao Airport"]]}," and then goes on to Nanjing Zhongyangmen (and back). From there, take the metro or a taxi to your destination. It costs ¥136 from Shanghai and the trip takes about five hours (only about four at night). Many people prefer to take a train to Shanghai then bus, taxi or train to Nanjing.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nThere are many daily departures to and from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai"]]}," Station and Shanghai Hongqiao Station, which is about four hours away on slow trains and around 75 minutes on the new fast ones (see ",{"type":"[[","value":[["High-speed rail in China"]]},"). Both types of train also stop at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wuxi"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Suzhou"]]}," and some continue on to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hangzhou"]]},". Fast trains offer better equipment and are comparable with a business class flight, while slow trains are older and without as many amenities, but may suit people traveling on a budget.\n\nThe main station is simply Nanjing Station, although locals refer to it as Nanjing North. It is situated on the north shore of Xuanwu Lake and is also very close to Zhongyangmen long-distance bus station. It is modern and more like an airport than a train station - the departure areas are on the 2nd and 3rd floors and you'll go through a ticket and security check to enter this area. Look for your train number on the indicator boards to find the right waiting room and when your train is called (usually 10 minutes before departure) just follow the crowd to find the right platform. Arrivals are in the basement, as is the taxi stand and the entrance to the subway station. The ticket office, pedestrian entrance and the local-bus station is on the first floor.\n\nZhonghuamen Station (adjacent to Zhonghuamen metro and bus stations, formerly called Nanjing South, changed its name to Zhonghuamen Station to prevent duplicate the name with the new high-speed Nanjing South station opened in June 2011) is to undergo a major redevelopment and most long-distance overnight services will depart from here in the future. Although it's only a tiny station with a few services a day, the majority of services between Nanjing and Huangshan (Yellow Mountain) will stop here so it's worth booking a ticket to Zhonghuamen to avoid a slow 45-minute ride around the eastern suburbs to the main station. The south station is located about 1 block east of Zhonghuamen subway station so onwards connections are easy and usually quicker than from the main station.\n\nAll passenger service at Nanjing West Station has been suspended since 2012. The former terminal station just west of the downtown area was built in 1908; it will be converted into a railway museum in the next few years.\n\nThe new Nanjing South Station is huge, and served by Nanjing metro. It is the main station for long-haul high-speed trains to Beijing, Shanghai, Xuzhou, Zhengzhou, Jinan, Tianjin, Wuhan, Hefei and other destination. For destinations like Zhenjiang, Danyang, Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, Kunshan, you may find Nanjing Station is more convenient. There are two 300 km\/h high-speed rail lines connect Nanjing and Shanghai. One is Shanghai–Nanjing HSR line depart at Nanjing's main station. The other one is Beijing–Shanghai HSR line depart at Nanjing South Station. If you are going to Shanghai, it's okay to use either line, and trains on Beijing–Shanghai lines are usually faster as it is a long distance line and has less stops. But if you are going to intermediate stations like Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Wuxi, or Suzhou, Shanghai–Nanjing HSR line at Nanjing's main station is preferred, as stations on Beijing–Shanghai line are usually far away from the urban area of these cities (Shanghai and Kunshan are exceptions, both rail lines use the same station). There is also a 250 km\/h high-speed rail line connect Nanjing with Hefei and Wuhan. A trip to Hefei takes around one hour, and Wuhan 3.5 to 4 hours. A ride to Beijing usually take 4 hours on a G-series bullet train.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nNanjing is well connected to Shanghai, Hangzhou and most destinations within Jiangsu, Anhui and northern Zhejiang provicnces by bus as well as longer overnight sleeper services to Beijing (12 hours) and Guangzhou (24 hours). Most services depart from Zhongyangmen bus station, a large, clean modern terminal in the north of the city approximately 10 minutes walk to the west of the main train station. The station has English signange and announcements but the ticket clerks generally cannot understand English. Some services into Anhui province depart from Nanjing South (Zhonghuamen) station, which is adjacent to Zhonghuamen metro station. There are also bus stations serving nearby destinations at Hanzhongmen, Nanjing East (to the north of Purple Mountain) and Nanjing North (on the west side of the Yangtze River) although they are less useful to travellers.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By road"]},"\nThere is a modern highway system between Shanghai and Nanjing, which can allow you to travel quite quickly from city to city. Beware of traffic in the morning and evening rush hours. If you're just one person, it may be much cheaper to travel by train, but if you're in a larger group, sharing a car service can be cheaper. Keep in mind that you need to be a very experienced driver to handle Chinese traffic, so you may be better served using trains and buses between the cities and taxis in the cities, unless you're really on for a challenge.\n\nIf you are interested in driving yourself, see ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Driving in China"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\nNanjing is situated on the Yangtze river. Scheduled passenger liner service is available along the Yangtze river between Shanghai downstream and Wuhan in the Hubei province upstream, although, the river is mostly used for transport of goods.\n\nThere are also frequent ferry services across the river, in particular from Zhongshan Wharf (near Nanjing West Railway Station) to Pukou.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nIf you're staying more than a few days it's worth buying a Jinlingtong (also known as IC-tong). These are available from any subway station, most bus termini and from any branch of Huaxia Bank (look for an information window displaying the letters 'IC'). The card costs Y75 and contains Y25 refundable deposit and Y50 credit, and can be topped up at the aforementioned locations. The card can be used on the subway, all city buses (but not all suburban buses), cross-river ferries, taxis (although drivers are reluctant to accept them and may tell you the scanner is broken) and in some Suguo convenience stores.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nTaxis are a great way to get around and most trips will cost less than ¥25. The cab driver should start the meter as soon as you are picked up (all meters start at ¥9 + ¥2 service fee); if the cab driver doesn't start using the meter and you don't say anything he\/she may assume you don't know any better and overcharge you at the end of your journey. Ask for a printed receipt detailing the cab number, kilometers traveled, times, and money exchanged from the driver upon exiting the cab. Don't expect to get a cab during both the morning and afternoon rush hours; demand is high and the drivers make their shift changes around these times, too. Tipping is not expected in cabs in China, so the price on the meter is the price you should pay along with a two yuan gas tax fee (There is an additional receipt for this fee.). Unlike cabbies in Beijing or Shanghai (who frequently shuttle foreigners around and may be accustomed to gratuity under the table) tipping in Nanjing is an alien concept. You are likely to befuddle but please a driver by insisting that they accept additional 'free' money. As with anywhere else in China, you are very unlikely to get a driver who speaks any English, so unless you speak Mandarin, remember to get your hotel's business card, and get hotel staff to write down your destination names in Chinese to show your taxi driver before you set off.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By subway"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Muxuyuan Station - P1060604.JPG"],["250px"],["thumb"],["Inside Nanjing Metro"]]},"\nThe Subway is a clean, cheap, safe and fast way of getting from A to B quickly - the system has 2 lines and covers most of the central city.

Single-journey tokens cost between 2 and 4 yuan depending on distance and can be purchased from vending machines in the station. Stored-value tickets are also available (see above) and give a 5% discount.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nBuses are handy for getting around - particularly places that are inaccessible by subway, although Nanjing's bus system feels a little aged compared to Hangzhou and Shanghai and has no English information. However, Google Maps displays bus services for Nanjing and some tourist maps such as those sold around the train station will have bus routes.\n\nBuses running within the city proper will carry a route number displayed on a red placard below the front windscreen next to the entrance door. Low-numbered routes (1-100) follow major thoroughfares and link major shopping, residential and transportation hubs. 3-figure route numbers follow indirect routes and run around quieter residential streets and are less handy for travellers, but can be an interesting way of seeing Nanjing's ordinary working-class neighbourhoods. Routes displaying the Chinese character for 'you' (travel) are primarily aimed at tourists and link all the major tourist sights. Routes numbered '8XX' e.g. 801, 806, 813 etc. are night buses which run approximately twice an hour between 11pm and 5am when the regular service ends. Buses heading to surrounding suburban towns depart from hubs on the edge of downtown such as Nanjing Train Station (North\/East), Changjiang Daqiao (Yangtze River No.1 Bridge - going north-west), Hanzhongmen (West) and Zhonghuamen (South\/East). These services display the name of the suburb\/town that they serve in Chinese characters and have no route number.\n\nFares are a flat 2 yuan on numbered services except for some routes which run older non-airconditioned buses which charge 1 yuan - no change is given so have some coins ready. For suburban routes, fares are charged by distance and a conductor collects the fares. There's a discount of 20% for IC card users. Note that many bus stops are some distance apart (often 3-4 blocks) so keep an eye out for your stop and an ear out for the stop's name on the PA announcements (which are only in Chinese). If the bus is quiet then press the buzzer next to the door to signal to the driver that you want to alight.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bicycle"]},"\nNanjing is fairly cycle-friendly with segregated bike lanes on most busy roads - however there are a lot of bikes on the road so care should be taken. Generally, the pace is quite slow, and some of the hills in the central-west part of the city can be tiring to climb (but fun and a little scary to descend). Although it's possible to cycle up the Purple Mountain, it should be tackled in the early morning as the roads will be crammed with fast-moving bus and taxi traffic for most of the day, and the roads are narrow with no bike lanes. The bike\/pedestrian path around the edge of Xuanwu Lake is a popular place for cyclists, as well as a popular racing ground for local motorcyclists - take care on the many blind corners.\n\nBikes can be rented from most youth hostels - but ensure that the tires are pumped up and the brakes work before setting off.\n\nBuying a bike is relatively easy and cheap - the cheapest option is to get a good quality used (possibly stolen) bike from the bike markets around Tangzi Jie (behind the Sheraton hotel) for ¥100-200. However, buying a bike at a low price on Tangzi Jie sends a wrong message to thieves and it is a sure way to make criminal activities worse — and if that doesn't trouble your conscience, consider that if your \"second-hand\" bike is found by its real owner, you will lose it. The cheap bikes sold in department stores and supermarkets are very poor quality and shouldn't be relied upon. For higher-quality, higher-performance bikes: Giant, Trek and Specialized all have stores in Nanjing. Remember to carry a strong lock - bike theft is common.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThe city pass can be bought for ¥100 at the entrance to any of the big parks in the city, such as the zoo or Yuhuatai Memorial Park and provides you with free entry to 21 different locations.

Qin Huai River is so fascinating that it captures the imaginations of people both at home and abroad.There are many famous sites of interest along the banks of the Qin Huai River , including Confucius Temple just 5 minutes away, Zhanyuan Garden, Zhonghua Gate, and the sights along the Taoye Ferry ride to Zhenhuai Bridge.Taking the painted boats to cruise on the Qinhuai River, visitors can not only admire the sights along the river but can also experience the traditional culture of Nanjing.

Entry is free and drinks are cheap (Y15 for a bud, Y10 for a tequila) and has live music on Saturday nights.\n\nOther popular expat drinking spots include Jimmy's (on Hanzhong Rd West, just past the Bank of China) which is next to the YESBar nightclub\/KTV and has excellent burgers, pizzas and Mexican food as well as a good choice of imported beers (mostly Australian) for about ¥20-30 a bottle and also has hookah pipes with various flavoured tobaccos (but no illegal substances, although they also stock Rizla Superking rolling papers... they're hard to come by in China).\n\nFinnegans Wake Irish Bar is an ",{"type":"'''","value":["authentic Irish bar"]}," on the Cinnalane development just north of Sanshan Street subway station, No. 400 ZhongShan South Road just north of ShengZhou Road. (Exit Sanshan Street subway station via exit 2. Walk 200 meters North. Turn left into the pedestrian mall at the underground car park entrance\/Wang Steak. Walk thirty meters. Quickly you’ll see that familiar Guinness sign on your left.). The bar has excellent food (meals are in the ¥100 range) which use ingredients sourced from Ireland and there is a good choice of drinks including Kilkenny and Guinness (¥70 a pint). Good news if your tab gets too high - they take VISA cards!

Nanjing is now officially the safest city in China - this was the honour of Hangzhou until a recent rise in hotel robberies put Hangzhou in the headlines. This doesn't mean there is no risks. Pickpocketing is a problem in Fuzimiao as well as on crowded buses, the subway and around the main transport hubs. Because Nanjing has a relatively small number of foreigners for a city its size, the common scams seen in Shanghai and Beijing are almost non-existent, however you may still see the occasional dodgy salesman selling counterfeit goods in Fuzimiao.\n\nBe careful if taking the bus to the airport from Zhonghuamen bus station as many touts claim to be the official bus service, however there is a strong risk of being overcharged or driven to a location several kilometres from the actual airport. The official bus departs from Gate 7 and tickets should be paid for at the gate. Bus Tickets are ¥20 as of March 2010. The fee remains the same in July 2012. Also be careful of fake taxis operating from the bus stations and occasionally the railway station - always use the official taxi stand and ignore any taxi touts.\n\nAlthough traffic is slightly calmer than most Chinese cities it can still be much more manic than most Western countries - take the usual precautions when crossing the road and also remember that right turns on a red light are sometimes legal in China(however in Nanjing most of the case there should be a dedicated right turn signal for right turn lane) so people driving across the crosswalk while the 'walk' sign is showing aren't actually breaking the law. Also be careful of motorbikes and bicycles driving on the pavement.\n\nMany older Nanjingese may have a resentment towards the Japanese because of the events during World War II. If you are Japanese, don't let this put you off visiting as the locals will still be very welcoming, however it's recommended not to appear too conspicuously Japanese and keep any opinions to yourself. Younger Nanjingese are more open and will often be more than happy to discuss the war.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lake Tai"]]}," is reasonably close, a common weekend getaway for Nanjing residents."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Huangshan"]]}," or Yellow Mountain is a national park on the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["UNESCO World Heritage List"]]}," "]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=Jinghu Railway icon.png"],["imagesize1=100"],["directionl1=N"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beijing"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bengbu"]]}],["directionr1=E"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zhenjiang"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["guidecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Jiangsu"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["32.0484"],["118.769"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Nanjing"]]}]
