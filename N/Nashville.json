It was incorporated in 1806 and became the county seat of Davidson County. Nashville was named the capital of Tennessee in 1843.\n\nLike many Southern cities, Nashville was not immune to the economic woes of the post-Civil War South but it quickly rebounded. It only took a few years for the city to reclaim its important shipping and trading position and to develop a solid manufacturing base. The post-Civil War years of the late 19th century brought a new found prosperity to Nashville. These healthy economic times left the city with a legacy of grand classical-style buildings, which can still be seen around the downtown area.\n\nSince the 1970s, the city has experienced tremendous growth, particularly during the economic boom of the 1990s under the leadership of Mayor (former Tennessee Governor) Phil Bredesen, who made urban renewal a priority, and fostered the construction or renovation of several city landmarks, including the Country Music Hall of Fame, the Nashville Public Library downtown, Bridgestone Arena, and LP Field.\n\n:For more information please visit the ",{"type":"''","value":["Nashville Convention and Visitors Bureau"]},", 150 Fourth Avenue North, ",{"type":"''","value":["+1 615"]}," 259-4730,  ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.visitmusiccity.com"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Imperial"],["janhigh =   46"],["febhigh = 51"],["marhigh =   61"],["aprhigh =   70"],["mayhigh =   78"],["junhigh =   85"],["julhigh =   89"],["aughigh =   88"],["sephigh =   82"],["octhigh =   71"],["novhigh =   59"],["dechigh =   49"],["janlow =   28"],["feblow =   31"],["marlow =   39"],["aprlow =   47"],["maylow =   57"],["junlow =   65"],["jullow =   70"],["auglow =   68"],["seplow =   61"],["octlow =   49"],["novlow =   40"],["declow =   32"],["description = ",{"type":"{{","value":[["ForecastNOAA"],["Nashville"],["36.19"],["-86.78"]]}]]},"\nNashville sits in the middle of a geographic region known as the Nashville Basin.
