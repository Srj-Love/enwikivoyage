Due to the Bahamas' strategic location near trade routes and its multitude of islands, Nassau soon became a popular ",{"type":"'''","value":["pirates' den"]},", and British rule was soon challenged by the self-proclaimed \"Privateers Republic\" under the leadership of the infamous Edward Teach, better known as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Blackbeard"]},".  However, the alarmed British soon tightened their grip, and by 1720 the pirates had been killed or driven out.\n\nToday, with a population of 260,000, Nassau contains nearly 80% of the population of the Bahamas.  However, it's still quite low-rise and laid back, with the pretty pastel pink government buildings and the looming giant ",{"type":"[[","value":[["cruise ships"]]}," that dock daily. \n \n",{"type":"===","value":["Orientation"]},"\nOrienting yourself in central Nassau is fairly easy.  ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bay Street"]},", which runs parallel to the shore, is the main shopping street, filled with an odd mix of expensive jewelry boutiques and souvenir shops.  The hill that rises behind Bay St contains most of the Bahamas' government buildings and company headquarters, while the residential ",{"type":"'''","value":["Over-the-Hill"]}," district starts on the other side.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\nNassau's ",{"type":"'''","value":["Lynden Pindling International Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["NAS"]]},") is the largest airport in the Bahamas.  Most major U.S. airlines (with the notable exception of Southwest) have flights to Nassau.  Limited service from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Toronto"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]}," also exists.\n\nThe two most popular Fixed Based Operators (FBO) located at Lynden Pindling International Airport are Executive Flight Services and Odyssey Aviation. Air taxi and air charter companies such as ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.jscharter.com Jetset Charter"]}]}," fly a variety of private charter aircraft and jets, from charter luxury Gulfstream's down to economical piston twins for small groups and individuals into and out of Nassau.\n\nThe airport itself has seen better days, but the free drinks occasionally served on arrival and the live band serenading the Immigration hall help set the tone.  No public transport is available at the airport, but there's a list of fixed taxi fares posted at the exit.  It's about US$25 and 10 mi (16 km) to most hotels in central Nassau.\n\nOn the way back, note that there are three terminal concourses: domestic and charter flights, flights to the US, and non-US international flights.  US Immigration\/Customs preclearance can be very time-consuming, so show up at least two hours before your flight.  Security for other destinations is considerably more laid back, and an hour should suffice.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By sea"]},"\nNassau is a favorite port of call for the many cruise ships plying the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bahamas"]]},".

The water taxi stops operating at 6PM.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By minibus"]},"\nMinibuses (locally known as jitneys) act as the bus system of Nassau city and New Providence island.  Jitneys are found on and near Bay Street.  The famous #10 Jitney to Cable Beach loads passengers on George & Bay Streets (in front of McDonalds, across from the British Colonial Hilton).  Other jitneys are located on Charlotte & Bay Streets.  A bus will typically wait until it's full before departing.  Understanding the various routes can be complex.  Many have destinations painted on the bus, but there is no standard as they are run by multiple companies and individuals.  Ask around for your destination. Note that there is no jitney that goes to Paradise Island (Atlantis Resort).\n\nJourneys cost $1.25 per person, per ride.  A round trip, even if not getting off the bus (ie: sightseeing), is counted as two rides.  Payment is received by the driver when disembarking. No change is given, and there is no transfer credit for changing busses.\n\nThe Jitney is definitely a very inexpensive way to enjoy the local culture.  Be aware that the jitneys stop operating between 6 and 7 PM.  The only way back to downtown after 7 PM is by taxi which can be quite expensive.\nThe buses (also called Jitneys) are 32-seaters and travel to many parts of the Island. They operate from 6:30AM to 6PM daily, except on Sundays when there is limited service. The basic fare is $1 per person and $2 for areas on the outskirts of town. Exact fare is required. The schedule is as follows:\n\nFrom Bay Street (opposite Parliament Street) to the Eastern end of the Island (including foot of the bridge to Paradise Island) and return -- Bus Numbers: 1, 9, 9A, 9B, 19, 21, 21A, 23\n\nFrom Bay Street (opposite Market Street) to the Marathon Mall and return -- Bus Numbers: 1, 1A, 3, 19, 21\n\nFrom Frederick Street (Bay Street) to Town Center Mall and return -- Bus Numbers: 4, 4A, 5, 5A, 6, 6A, 11A, 12, 15, 15A\n\nFrom Bay Street (George Street) to Cable Beach and return -- Bus Numbers: 10, 10A\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nTaxis, often minivans and always identifiable by their yellow license plates and little Gothic blackletter \"Taxi\" lettering, roam the streets of Nassau.
