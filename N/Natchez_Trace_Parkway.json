The route has been in use from pre-Colonial times and includes exceptional scenery, Indian burial mounds, overlooks, hiking trails, nature exhibits, and sites of historic interest. There are no commercial vehicles allowed on the road, making the route a laid back journey through the Southeast.  Although it is an impressive 444 miles in length, the park averages only 800 feet in width.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" History "]},"\n\nThe Parkway follows the old Natchez trace from Natchez to Nashville. The trace originated as a footpath used by Native Americans and early explorers to travel across the region.  In the late 1700s the route was in heavy use by Ohio Valley farmers, who floated their goods down the Mississippi, sold their flatboats for lumber, and then returned home on foot.  These \"Kaintucks\" often walked the trace's approximately five hundred mile distance in just thirty days.  By 1820 over twenty \"stands\" (inns) were located along the route to cater to the increasing traffic.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Landscape "]},"\n\nThe Natchez Trace Parkway is a haven of biodiversity because it traverses a variety of ecosystems that possess an amazing array of natural features. The southern portion of the park features bayous and swamps situated in the floodplains of meandering rivers. Man-made impoundments of flowing watercourses have created small ponds and massive lakes with miles of shoreline. As the park rises in elevation, outcrops of limestone become apparent, some of which contain caves and fossils. Limestone is also the parent material underlying the park's remnant prairies. The natural feature most readily visible, however, are the vast tracts of eastern deciduous forest lining the parkway motor road.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Flora and fauna "]},"\n\nAs a 444-mile long National Park, the Natchez Trace Parkway provides a safe corridor for wildlife to move between neighboring national forests, state parks, and other public lands. While traveling on the Parkway, visitors may see mammals on the move, especially around dawn and dusk. Deer are quite common, but a lucky traveler may have a chance to see a coyote, fox, or armadillo. While black bear have been confirmed on the Parkway, a bear sighting is extremely rare.\n\nSeveral of the parkway's pull-offs are noted for their quality birding opportunities. Wading birds such as great blue herons, great egrets and double-crested cormorants can be seen from the Ross Barnett Reservoir, Ten-Tom Waterway, or Colbert Ferry.  Songbirds such as buntings, cardinals, cedar wakings and scarlet tanagers are commonly seen from the Rocky Springs, Jeff Busby, Witch Dance, Donivan Slough, and Meriwether Lewis nature trails.  Raptors such as bald eagles, red-tailed hawks, Mississippi kites, and kestrels have been seen in the skies at Chickasaw Village, Pharr Mounds, Water Valley Overlook, and Birdsong Hollow.  The parkway's grasslands are home to killdeer, whip-poor-wills, and the Northern bobwhite.  Hundreds of people visit Rock Spring every fall to witness the ruby-throated hummingbirds feasting on jewelweed nectar. Featured on the North Alabama Birding Trail, both Rock Spring and Colbert Ferry provide excellent birding opportunities throughout the year.  In addition, turkey, Canada Geese, vultures, and hawks are often visible while driving.\n\nFifteen species of frogs, from big bullfrogs to stealthy leopard frogs, are known to live within the woods and wetlands preserved along the parkway.  Newts and salamanders are plentiful within the park as well.  Note that the park's amphibians are very vulnerable to traffic, particularly south of Interstate 20 in Mississippi, and frequently try to cross the parkway between December and March in an attempt to reach their breeding pools; please obey posted speed limits to protect them.\n\nThe Parkway is home to over 40 different species of reptiles, including alligators, turtles, and snakes. While reptiles may not be as easy to spot as many of the mammal species of the Parkway, there are opportunities to see alligators at Cypress Swamp, or turtles along the numerous creeks and streams along the Natchez Trace Parkway.  There are 25 species of snakes that live along the Parkway, with only three of them being venomous (Southern Copperhead, Western Cottonmouth, and Canebrake Rattlesnake). While the chance of seeing a venomous snake is rare, visitors are encouraged to use caution when hiking and picnicking along the Parkway.\n\nThe Natchez Trace Parkway contains a huge and diverse array of plant species by virtue of it being a 444 mile long park oriented in a generally north-south direction. This enables it to contain representative habitat from four ecosystem provinces: the eastern broadleaf forest at the northern end of the park is dominated by hickory and oak species, while the lower Mississippi riverine forest at the opposite terminus features beech and oak species adapted to warmer conditions. In between the two extremes lie the outer coastal plain mixed forest and the southeastern mixed forest, both of which contain more of a pine and hardwood mix. Add to this diverse array of ecoregions the fact that the parkway traverses eight major watersheds, and it is not surprising that as of now nearly 2,200 plant species have been documented in the park. More will surely follow as additional studies are completed. But while this diversity of species is impressive, more readily apparent is the ever-changing beauty of the park's vegetation, whether it be the flowers of spring, the lush greenery of summer, or the magnificent fall colors of autumn.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Climate "]},"\n\nIn the summer, expect hot and humid weather throughout the length of the Parkway, high temperatures typically in the 90s.  In the winter, because the Parkway spans 444 miles north and south, conditions vary greatly.  Expect very mild winters near Natchez with only occasional freezing.  In Tennessee, snow and icy bridges are common.  Spring and fall are very pleasant. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Fees \/ Permits "]},"\n\nThere are no fees for entering the parkway, nor for any of the visitor centers, exhibits, or campgrounds along the route.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Prepare"]},"\n\nThere is no food or gas located on the parkway itself, but the route passes numerous towns where services are available.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nA combination of low speed limits and no commercial traffic make for a very relaxing and enjoyable drive - popular with bicyclists, motorcyclists, and cars.  The route is fairly unique in that a motorist can travel the 444-mile length without seeing commercial buildings, traffic lights, or many other signs of the modern world.  Rangers enforce the 50 mph speed limit, so the journey is at a slower pace than on most modern roads.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drive"]},"\n\nThe parkway mileposts start at Natchez (milepost 0) and end near Nashville at milepost 444.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tennessee"]]}," "]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["444.0 Northern Terminus"]},".

Please obey posted limits, both for your own safety and for the safety of wildlife that makes the area its home.\n\nDangers from wildlife are minimal and exercising commonsense should prevent any unwanted encounters.  There are three species of venomous snake in the area (Southern Copperhead, Western Cottonmouth, and Canebrake Rattlesnake), which, while rarely seen, can be avoided by paying close attention to where hands and feet are placed.  Note that all wildlife, including venomous snakes, is protected along the Natchez Trace Parkway.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Nashville"]]}]}," - The parkway's northern terminus is located in America's country music capital."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Tupelo"]]}]}," - Elvis Presley's birthplace is located just off of the parkway near milepost 260."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Jackson (Mississippi)"],["Jackson"]]}]}," - The parkway passes through Mississippi's capital city between mileposts 90 and 100."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Vicksburg"]]}]}," - Site of a major Civil War battlefield and home to the Vicksburg National Military park, this town is located about fifteen miles from the parkway near milepost 60."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Natchez"]]}]}," - The parkway's southern terminus is home to an impressive and historic cemetery as well as many Antebellum homes."]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["guideitinerary"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["related"],["United States National Parks"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Natchez Trace Parkway"]]}]
