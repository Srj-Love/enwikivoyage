The chariot carrying the image is said to have become stuck in Mewar while traveling, and hence a temple was established with the permission of the then Rana of Mewar at Nathdwara. \n\nAccording to local worshipers, the Srinathji deity is believed to have originally self manifested from stone and emerged from the Govardhan Hill. Shrinathji was originally worshipped in a humble shrine and then moved to a larger temple on top of the Govardhan Hill. Vallabhacharya made arrangements for the worship of this deity, and this tradition was continued by his son, Vitthalnathji. It is believed that Taj Bibi, a wife of the Emperor Akbar, had visited this temple. It was during the 17th century that this image was shifted to Rajasthan   \n\nThe structure of this temple is simple, but the aesthetic appeal of this temple is ceaseless. The image of Shrinathji is worth seeing and feeling the celestial beauty of the God. Lord Shrinathji symbolizes a form of Lord Krishna, when he lifted the 'Govardhana' (a hill). In the image, the lord is revealed with his left hand raised and the right is bunged in a fist. The idol is carved out of a large black stone. Images of two cows, a snake, a lion, two peacocks and a parrot by the god's head are imprinted on the idol. \n\nThe temple authorities have not less than 500 cows and amongst them; one is regarded as Shrinathji's cow. It is considered that this cow has come from the pedigree that served the lord for centuries. Earlier, wagon-loads of food used to come here, which were said to be consigned by and consigned to Shrinathji. The holy shrine of Shrinathji is famous all over Rajasthan and India. People of Vaishnava community come in large numbers to visit this holy pilgrimage.\n\nDarshan opens eight times a day and the devotees are expected to keep track of the timings. Every darshan is called by different names like Mangala (early morning), Gwal, Utthapan etc. The Lord looks different in every darshan and the Rajbhog darshan taking place around noon is the most important and sought after. During any major hindu festival it is common to see enormous crowds packing the entire town and the temple complex.\n\nPhotography and mobile phones are strictly prohibited in the temple premises\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nThe main attractions are the Aartis and the Shringar, i.e. the dressing and beautifying of the idol of Lord, treating it as a person, adorning it with best appropriate dresses for the time of day \/ night. The intricately woven shaneels and silk clothe have original zari and embroidery work done upon them, along with tonnes of real precious jewels. The formal prayers are offered with diya, incense sticks, flowers, fruit and other offerings, with local instruments and devotional songs of the Lord Shrinathji, according to the demand of the time and occasion. The view of the idol, called jhakhi, after the ‘‘parda’’ (curtain) is removed is a spectacular sight, that is simply mesmerizing, leading to a melee (gully) of visitors crowding to have a glimpse (jhakhi) of divine Lord. The mystic, spirited aura of India comes alive.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nNathdwara has a small but throbbing township around the temple.
