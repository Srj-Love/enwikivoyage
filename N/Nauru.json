Although other island states may be smaller and\/or less populous, they are all dependent territories of other countries. An off the beaten track-destination if there ever was one, Nauru is also the least visited country in the world. The remoteness, and the fact that much of the island is a charmless open phosphate mine, are two strong reasons for this.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nMining of Nauru's phosphate deposits, which occupied about 90% of the island, began in the early 20th century under a German-British consortium. During World War I, the island was occupied by Australian forces and became a dependent territory.  Nauru achieved independence in 1968.  In the 1980s, phosphate exports briefly gave Nauruans one of the highest per capita incomes in the Third World.  As of 2008, most of Nauru's revenue comes from the export of phosphate to Australia, South Korea and New Zealand as well as other countries. The industry is controlled by the Nauru Phosphate Corporation (NPC). It is anticipated that the phosphate reserves will be completely exhausted before 2050. The sale of fishing licences is the other major revenue raiser.  Countries such as Australia and Taiwan provide substantial development cooperation funding. Despite this, the unemployment rate currently stands at 90%.\n\nIn 2001 the container ship ",{"type":"''","value":["Tampa"]}," rescued several hundred asylum seekers from a sinking Indonesian vessel and attempted to deliver them to Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean, which is an Australian Federal Territory.
