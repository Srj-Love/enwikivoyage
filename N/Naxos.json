The main town, referred to as 'Hora' on maps, but also as simply 'Naxos' or 'Naxos Town', contains most of the shops and restaurants frequented by visitors. A number of beach communities extend south along the coast from Hora.\n\nThe port at Hora is too small for cruise ships, and too close to the more famous Santorini, saving the island from hordes of tourists.  The majority of non-Greek tourists stay in the few beach towns close to Hora, so it is very easy to lose them in the rural centre, or further along the coast.  Many wealthy Athenians own houses in the old villages of Halki and Filoti, and use the island as escape from the heat of Athenian summers.\n\nThe islands has stunning Mediterranean beaches, with white granite sands, and mountains and lush green valleys, making it more varied than many of the other islands.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nThe climate of Naxos varies depending on region.  The west side is sheltered and flat, getting up to 30 degrees in the summer.  Sea breezes help to prevent it feeling too stuffy directly on the coast.  In the centre, the mountains and valleys keep the air temperature cooler.  The mountains are high enough that it is rare to have a completely cloudless day, again helping to keep it cool.  The rain caused by the mountains keeps the land green and fresh, unlike its rather brown Cycladic cousins.  Rain storms are infrequent in the summer, but very heavy, turning marble paths and streets into ice rinks.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nEnglish and German are very common in Hora; French and Italian are also spoken by many.  Elderly people often only speak Greek, especially in rural central areas.  In the villages, expect to have to order in Greek or by pointing.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nNaxos is about 5 1\/2 hours by the fastest regular ferry from Piraeus, faster by catamaran, and about 2 hours by regular ferry from Santorini.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By sea"]},"\nFrom the Greek mainland, ferries and highspeed catamaran services ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ferries.gr\/booking\/"]}," run daily all year from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Piraeus"]]},", and in high season from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rafina"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lavrio"]]},".\n\nNaxos is a central hub in the sea transport system, and enjoys multiple connections in all directions. Ferry boats and high speed catamaran services, respectively costing around € 29 and € 45 one-way in economy class, run daily from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Piraeus"]]}," during high season.\n\nVarious shipping companies sail for Naxos (via ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Paros"]]},") including:\n",{"type":"*","value":["Hellenic Seaways ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.hellenicseaways.gr"]}]},{"type":"*","value":["Blue Star Ferries ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.bluestarferries.com\/ENGLISH\/defaultmain.htm"]}]},{"type":"*","value":["NEL Lines ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.nel.gr"]}]},{"type":"*","value":["GA ferries ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.gaferries.gr\/index.php?lang=en"]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":["Aegean Speed Lines ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.aegeanspeedlines.gr\/index_en.html"]},"."]},{"type":"*","value":["Anek Lines ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.anek.gr"]},"."]},"\nNEL Lines also operates a highspeed link from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lavrio"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Attica"]]},". This is a pleasant port to travel from if you have the option, as it is relatively near the airport and doesn't have the stress and chaos of Piraeus.\n\nThere is also the High Speed (Hellenic Seaways) which leaves from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rafina"]]},", closer to Athens airport than Piraeus and a pleasant place to have lunch if you have time before you board your ferry.  The High Speed takes just under 4 hours and is around € 40 in high season.\n\nIn Naxos, ticket offices for ferries in all directions can be found along the quay in Hora. Ferries from Piraeus to Naxos are frequent, as many as half a dozen a day during the summer but generally two or more. The length of the trip does not require a cabin. Blue Star Lines is the most common carrier between Piraeus and Naxos. The ferry takes about 6 hours and the high-speed takes half that time and costs twice as much. Usually there are several departures at 7:30AM every day and then a high-speed and ferry at around 5PM and in the summer a ferry that leaves Piraeus at around 10PM. The Hellas Flying Dolphin High-speeds are catamarans and take about 4 hours to get to Naxos from Piraeus.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Sailing"]},"\nA welcoming port together with a lack of cruise ships make Naxos a popular stopping point on an Aegean sailing cruise.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nOlympic Air ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.olympicair.com\/Home.aspx?a_id=549"]}," operates a daily service from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Athens"]]}," on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday (as at summer 2013).  Flights take ~30 minutes, and planes are comfortable.  Naxos airport is small and basic, but very friendly.  If you're starting from Athens airport, it's much quicker than the ferry, due to the transfer to Piraeus.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Walking"]},"\nIn Hora, many areas are pedestrianised, making it easy to amble from beach to cafe to shop.  Outside Hora, there are many footpaths (the best map is Anavasi ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.anavasi.gr\/index.php?lang=en"]},"), but they are not always easy to follow.  Footpaths up Zas are easy and clearly marked.  Walking on the roads is fine, with caution, as cars are infrequent, but drivers tend to go fast.  In rural areas, locals will almost always offer a lift, especially if you can speak a little Greek.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Cycling"]},"\nNaxos starts to develop a bit of a cycling culture, with people visiting with cycling in mind. Cycle hire is possible. Simpler mountain bikes can be rented from many \"rent a car\" or \"rent a motorbike\" shops. More fancy Mountain bikes and especially road bikes can be rented from two specialized shops in Hora. If you bring your own bike and need repairs\/parts\/accessories, there is a bike repair shop near the harbour (",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.naxosbikes.com Giannis bike shop"]}]},", in the \"grota\" area, they are also one of the shops renting road bikes). If you plan on doing serious cycling with a rental bike, consider bringing at least your own shoes with cleats. If you plan on bringing your own bike, it's good to know that on Blue Star ferries you can transport your bike as luggage without any extra charge.\n\nBike theft is not as prevalent as in big cities, but it is now recommended that you look after your bike or use at least a simple lock in town - though you will still see unlocked older bikes around sometimes.\n\nDrivers are getting more used to cyclists these days, but they are still speeding and driving reckless in general, so beware. Mountain roads in summer offer a great ride, take care to stay hydrated and know your limits. In July and August it is recommended to take advantage of early morning \/ early evening hours. Some of the best known road cycling routes are the climb to Apeirantho and the \"circle of the island\" passing by Apollona. Easier and flatter cycling routes are around Hora towards Agia Anna, Plaka, Mikri Vigla, Alyko.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Bus"]},"\nEvery village has a bus service, but there may only be 3 buses a day.  Find information stuck to the kiosk, or ask at the bus office at the north end of the sea front in Hora (near the ferry building).  Tickets can be bought from the machine outside the bus offices, or from a kiosk in the villages.  They cost ~2 euros, depending on destination.  You must have a ticket before you board.  Expect the morning bus to be standing only, full of little old ladies going to do shopping.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Cars, scooter and quad bikes"]},"\nThe roads are very well maintained, with extensive repairs and upgrades carried out within the last ten years.\n\nThe mountain roads are windy, with steep drops, and frequent shrines, normally above a burnt out car that hasn't been recovered.  Tourists are a pain on the roads, because they are not used to Greek-style driving, so don't give way, causing long tail backs.  Expect to meet a truck hurtling around a blind bend.  They take no prisoners!\n\nA better option is a quad bike.  They are more stable and safer than scooter, are narrow enough that even if you meet a truck, you don't get run off, and have the advantage of being able to see the amazing scenery as you drive through.  Also much easier to park in busy villages with narrow streets.\n\nEvery village has a petrol station.  The owner normally puts the petrol in for you.  Petrol stations are a social gathering point in more remote areas, so don't expect to get away without stopping to chat. When going to the eastern side of the island (Moutsouna, Panermos), take care to note that the last petrol station is near Filoti, in the center of the island, quite a distance off.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThe most recognizable landmark of Naxos is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Portara"]},", an iconic 6th century BC marble gate on the islet of Palatia in Naxos harbor. It is the only remnant of a temple dedicated to Apollo.\n\nNaxos is well known for its wonderful beaches, some with advantageous winds for prime windsurfing and kitesurfing. Most of the Island's West coast is one long sandy beach with crystal clear azure water, the most popular areas of which are Prokopios, Agia Anna, Plaka and Mikri Vigla.\n\nIt also has a mountainous interior with a great variety of valleys and villages, easily reachable by a well-maintained road system. Archaeological highlights include the Kouros of Melanes and Apollonas, Dimitra's Temple at Sangri and the Cheimarros Tower.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Castro"]},"\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Castro"]}," (old walled city) section, on its elevated ground overlooking the harbor, provides some of the quietest and most photogenic alleyways to be found in the town. It survives from the days when Naxos was an outpost of the Venetian empire.  The area was fortified against attack by locals and pirates.  The archaeology museum is well worth a visit, with a good collection of the Bronze Age Cycladean artifacts.  A good place to get out of the sun.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Beaches"]},"\nFor tourists, daytime activities centre on the ",{"type":"'''","value":["beaches"]},", especially those to the south of town, ",{"type":"'''","value":["Agios Prokopios"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["Agia Anna"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Plaka"]}," being the most famous ones.  These have beach cafes, wind surfing etc. Naxos beaches, like those on many Greek islands, offer clothing options. Generally, nude sunbathing is more frequently encountered in southern beach communities that have sand dunes blocking the view from the access road - such as in Plaka.  At the end of Plaka beach nearest to Ag. Anna there is a group of rocks and small coves, and this area is excellent for ",{"type":"'''","value":["naturists"]},". It is hidden from the road by trees, yet is an easy (300m) walk along a flat beach from the bus stop at Paradiso taverna.  To avoid the crowds, head further south to the crystal clear waters of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mikri Vigla"]},".  The locals swim on either side of the causeway to the Portara.  The west side is a sheltered shallow bay, with steps and seating built into the causeway.  The east side is much deeper, and if the sea is calm you can hold your breath and dive down to ancient columns that have fallen in from the temple.  Beware of sea urchins!\n\nThe tiny harbours of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Lionas"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Moutsouna"]}," on the East coast are very picturesque and quiet even in the summer months. Both have tavernas and a beach. A newly asphalted road from Moutsouna down to Panermos is also well worth exploring, as it passes by several secluded bays.\n\nFor those who love adventure, the island offers many opportunities for active sports. ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.bluefindivers.gr Bluefindivers Naxos Diving Center"]}]},", located at Agios Prokopios beach, offers beautiful and safe diving\/snorkelling trips around the island.

Ancient olive and lemon groves surround the small villages, with narrow gorges with terrapin-inhabited streams.  The area is still agricultural, with this being the main source of income to the island.  Above the groves rise two chains of mountains.  The central chain is a moonscape of exposed and weather gneiss, with the village ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ano Potamia"]}," perched in the middle.

Using these types of vehicles is very common on Naxos and there are a lot of rental agencies. Some of them are ready to cheat. They will offer faulty motorbikes or ATVs for a lower price, but in case of accident they will demand that the customer pay for the whole cost of damage. They are offering only basic insurance but will present it like full insurance. Also, there is a big possibility of serious injuries.\n\nIt is possible to recognize these rental agencies by observing them aggressively attracting tourists and offering lower prices than others. Employees in front of these type of agencies will be loud and ready to promise everything until the contract is signed. It is necessary to check the vehicle before making any decision. Their vehicles are in most of the cases dusty, dirty and look old. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\nMove on by boat to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Small Cyclades"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Paros"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mykonos"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ios"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Santorini"]]},".\n\nWord of advice: It is not an uncommon story on Naxos that someone who initially planned to stay for only a few days missed their original ferry out, and liked the island so much that they ended up staying there forever.
