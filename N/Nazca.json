It is most famous for the so-called ",{"type":"''","value":["Nazca Lines"]},", a mix of long lines, geometrical figures, and giant drawings in the desert sand.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nToday's Nazca town is on the site of where the ancient Nazca civilization was based after the fall of its first capital, Cahuachi, in around AD 400. It has an exotic, dusty, desert setting but holds little enchantment in itself. It can provide between a few hours' and a few days' entertainment depending on one's interest in the ",{"type":"'''","value":["ancient Nazca people"]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["The ancient Nazca people"]},"\n\nFor much of their history, the Nazca people were based in the Ceremonial City of Cahuachi, an ancient pilgrimage center 28 km southwest of modern Nazca. The society emerged in around 100 BC and was active until around AD 750. Its influence stretched from Ca√±ete in the north to Acari in the south. The lower section of the Nazca Valley was likely chosen to situate Cahuachi due to its abundant underground water, which allowed extensive irrigation for improved agriculture.\n\nThis civilization was responsible for the famous ",{"type":"'''","value":["Nazca lines"]},", giant representations of animals and other designs that are also seen on Nazca pottery and textiles found at Cahuachi. Discovered pottery fragments also suggest that the Nazca people gathered in the desert to perform religious ceremonies, with objects being smashed as offerings to the gods in the sky. The fragments found in the desert among the Nazca Lines are mainly pieces of panpipes and whistles, suggesting the importance of music in the religious rites.\n\nA series of natural disasters, climatic and tectonic, began to undermine the civilization in around AD 350. An earthquake finished the capital, Cahuachi, in around AD 400, leaving the society to limp into oblivion for next few centuries from its new base in what would become modern Nazca.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Discovery of Nazca culture"]},"\n\nNazca culture first aroused academic interest through its pottery. In the 1890s, archaeologist Max Uhle was studying ceramic samples at the Anthropologisch-Ethnografische Museum in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dresden"]]},". The consignment contained many works from South America, including some striking and colourful work from the Nazca people. In 1901 he travelled to Peru to examine their origins. After months of searching he arrived at the Valley of Ica at a place called Ocucaje, where he met farmers who told him about the ancient cemeteries where these colourful ceramics were frequently found. Uhle excavated the sites and found Nazca ceramics at many of them. His work introduced Nazca culture to the wider world.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Discovery of the Nazca lines"]},"\n\nThe Nazca Lines were first spotted when Faucette, an early Peruvian airline, began flying from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lima"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Arequipa"]]}," in the 1920s. The pilots noticed lines criss-crossing the desert between the valleys of Palpa and Nazca.\n\nThe pilots' discoveries led Toribio Mejia Xesspe, an archaeologist, to come to Nazca in 1926. His research arrived at the conclusion that the lines were part of ancient sacred roads. Xesspe never flew over the area and so only saw straight lines; he missed the figures. \n\nA more worthy discovery of the lines was made in 1939 by Paul Kosok of Long Island University. Kosok came to Nazca to study the ancient irrigation systems, the puquios (see below). He surveyed the channels and noted that over 50 of the underground aqueducts were still in used. He was told of other, even older, ancient channels and so set out to the Nazca desert but found only long shallows furrows. He thought that perhaps these other ancient channels were located very far away and so hired a small crop-dusting aircraft to go and find them. On the flight he saw hundreds of lines and geometrical forms in the desert. He later recalled asking the pilot to follow one particular line and being somewhat surprised at it leading to a bird! Kosok later met Maria Reiche, who then devoted her life to studying and preserving the lines.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Nazca channels or ",{"type":"''","value":["puquios"]}]},"\n\nAfter the fall of Cahuachi, the Nazca people still achieved some notable, though oft overlooked feats. An extensive series of underground channels, the puquios (a Quechua word to describe a natural spring), are one of the greatest legacies of the Nazca culture. This underground system is unique in South America, and perhaps the world, because of its very intricate construction. Over 50 underground channels were built over one hundred years starring in AD 400; many of them are still in use! Some of the best preserved channels are at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#See"],["Cantalloc"]]},", also known as Cantayo, where visitors can see a series of spiral blow holes, which were probably used to allow cleaning of the channels' interiors and also to restore them after earthquakes.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Nazca ceramics"]},"\n\nThe cemeteries along the Nazca River contained the colourful ceramic works that first drew attention to the Nazca people. The high-quality work on vessels shows realistic and complex depictions of the ancient Nazca world: everyday life, animals, plants, fruits, birds, insects and gods are all represented. Vessels showing stylized creatures, including zoomorphic and anthropomorphic designs, sometimes contain over ten colours. Bridge-handle bottles with two landfills are the most common find, but spherical pots were also produced, as well as cups and glasses. The best examples of Nazca ceramics are in museums, such as the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#See"],["Museo Arqueologico Antonini"]]}," in Nazca, the Anthropological and Archaeological Museum  in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lima"]]},", the Regional Museum of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ica"]]},", and many others in Peru and around the world.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Nazca textiles"]},"\n\nThe Nazca people's belief in life after death led to mummification of their corpses. The shrouds wrapping the dead were fine textiles, which still retain their quality and colours. The Nazca people, like many other pre-Inca peoples, believed textiles to be spiritually important, leading their textiles to be skillfully produced and depicting sophisticated artistic scenes on fabrics of cotton and the fibre of Andean camels. \nSamples from the ancient capital of Cahcuachi can be seen at the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#See"],["Museo Arqueologico Antonini"]]}," in Nazca.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nThere are frequent collectivos (small buses) to and from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ica"]]},".

They're unquestionably ancient (dating back 1400-2200 years), and remarkably precise (with straight lines and clean curves). The images are so huge that they are only appreciable from the air, a fact which has led to speculation that the ancient Nazca people either had access to hot air balloons or alien helpers.
