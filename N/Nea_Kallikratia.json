There are a multitude of ways to get here the most obvious being by air which is the easiest although not the cheapest option if you plan to travel during the sunner months. In this case you are not restricted to the two or three scheduled airlines which operate all year round. \nBecause of it's unique location on the coast of Central Halkidiki you have to pass it to get to any other resort on the Kassandra or Sithonia penninsula's and so it is easily accessible by all modes of transport except that of any train.\n\nNea Kallikratia can be reached from Thessaloniki by bus or coach as well as an expensive taxi ride, or from the airport you may find it easier to travel into Thessaloniki to get the regular bus service which is also the cheapest form of travel to the resort. If you hire a car there are a multitude of car hire agencies both in Thessaloniki and at Makedonia airport to meet your requirements, all of which depend on how deep your wallet is. After hiring a car it is no more than a 30 minute trip from the airport or 45 minutes from the city, except for Friday afternoon's during the summer when the roads are busy with everyone from the city flocking to the coasts for the weekend.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nThe tour of the nearby archaeological site of the ancient city of Antigonia, built by Antigonos-successor of Alexander the Great, is the town's major attraction.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Chalkidiki"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["no Wikipedia link"]]}]
