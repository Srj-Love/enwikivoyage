This article covers the town of Negara and all areas of interest in southern Jembrana regency outside of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Medewi Beach"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gilimanuk"]]},". \n\nThis is the least visited area of Bali, and is sparsely populated, except along the main southern coast road from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Denpasar"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gilimanuk"]]},", the seaport which connects Bali to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Java"]]},". Most of the land is covered by the forests and highlands of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["West Bali National Park"]]}," and adjacent protected areas. The flatter southern region is very fertile and is rice growing country. Villages have a clean air, partly due to the mass of flowering shrubs which almost obscure the neat little houses. Income is derived primarily from fishing, rice paddies and planations of coconut, coffee, cloves and vanilla. The main southern coast road runs alongside black sand beaches for much of its course through Jembrana regency. \n\nJembrana has always been a somewhat isolated regency and largely unaffected by events on the rest of the island. Its history is tied to Buleleng after the Dutch overran that Regency in 1849 and assumed control of Jembrana at the same time. Due primarily to settlement by Bugis people from Sulawesi, the influence of Islam is stronger here than anywhere else in Bali, and visitors will notice a relatively large number of mosques.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nNegara is on the main coastal road between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Denpasar"]]}," (about 75 km to the east) and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gilimanuk"]]}," (about 25 km to the west).

The whole area is sparsely populated, and two areas of some interest are the villages of Blimbingsari and Palasari. The former is a protestant community and the latter catholic, and both were carved of out the jungle by trailblazing Christian pioneers. The communities, whilst Christian, are heavily influenced by Balinese culture. There are epic plays and dances for example which substitute the normal Hindu characters with those from the Bible.
