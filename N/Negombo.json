Its key attraction is proximity to the international airport. Formerly the haunt of budget travellers, rising hotel rates and luxury resorts (Jetwing) mean it now attracts an elderly European crowd for its yellow, sandy beaches and its relaxing and friendly environment.  There are a few other tourist attractions, and decent opportunities for diving and watersports.\n\nThe 100 km long canal network running through the city is still used, and outrigger canoes and modern water-craft ply this route daily, for trade and tourist purposes. Remains of colonization include the Dutch fort built in 1672, as well as centuries-old Portuguese and Dutch houses, Administrative buildings, Churches and the ceiling frescoes of St. Mary's cathedral church. Negombo is the centre of Sri-Lanka's Catholic community, and you can expect to see many shrines during a visit.\n\nNegombo is also home to the country's second-largest fish market, the \"Lellama\", at the north end of the town's lagoon. There are daily fish auctions, which give tourists a chance to meet the area's fishermen and even organise fishing trips into the lagoon and the ocean beyond. Other nearby attractions open to visitors include Muthurajawela marshland, which is part.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nKatunayake International Airport (CMB) is closer to Negombo than the capital Colombo.
