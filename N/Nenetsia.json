Today, the region is vast, very sparsely populated, an important center of Russian gas and oil exploration and extraction, and, yes, cold. Nearly the entire region lies to the north of the Arctic Circle. The principal riverway of the region is the northwards flowing Pechorin River, which leads into the region from the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Komi Republic"]]}," and leads to the capital, Naryan-Mar, before terminating in the Barents Sea.\n\nIn addition to its sheer novelty, visitors will likely be most interested in Nenetsia's stark Arctic coastline, its reindeer herders, and its spectacular, otherworldly, lake-ridden tundra landscapes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nSome knowledge of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russian phrasebook"],["Russian"]]}," is pretty much requisite here, unless you have a guide.

The principal means of transport is by boat on the Pechorin River and on the seas to the north, but ship traffic is closed most of the year, only running from mid-July to mid-October. If you are traveling on an icebreaker, you may be able to navigate the Pechorin River as late as mid-November. For most of the year, the principal means of transport is by air—travel around the region may be possible via helicopter.\n\nNenetsia is also a good place to live out your Santa fantasies by traveling around on a reindeer-driven sleigh.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Itineraries"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Northwestern Russia"]]},"\n\n\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["commons:category:Nenetsia"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Nenetsia"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["68.833333"],["54.833333"]]}]
