However, the middle Vaishya and Shudra are underrepresented in the hills, apparently because they did not have compelling reason to leave the plains while Muslim invaders tried to eliminate previous elites.  Dalits seem to have accompanied the upper castes into the hills because they were bound by longstanding patronage arrangements. However, the absence of Vaishya people in the Hindu hill population supports the second theory.\n\nTraditional caste rules govern who can eat with whom, especially when boiled rice is served, and who can accept water from whom. Until the 1950s these rules were enforced by law.\n\nDalits are subject to caste-based discrimination and so called ‘untouchability’ in social, economic, educational, political and religious areas. The National Dalit Commission (2002) categorized 28 cultural groups as Dalits. Some argue that the use of the term Dalit will never ever help to abolish caste-based untouchability.

Although Nepal is a popular tourist destination, most flights from anywhere will stop on the way in either Asia or the Middle East. Because of this, expect long travel times if you're coming from Europe or North America.\n\nIn recent years, with the more stable political situation, more airlines are offering flights to Nepal. Some are listed in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kathmandu#By_plane"],["Kathmandu city article"]]},".\n\nThe terminal building has limited facilities. There is an immigration hall where new arrivals obtain their visas, a customs counter, a tourist information booth and a currency exchange counter. The latter may only have services available for a short time after scheduled flights arrive.  The departures area has a number of ticket counters for airline use, an immigration area where you have your visa and exit card examined, a security section where passengers and their baggage is searched or scanned, and several departure lounges. One small retail concession is available where you can buy drinks and some snacks.\n\nIt's possible to get passport photos prepared in the arrivals hall and pick up the immigration form from tables at the back of the hall, but your progress through immigration can be made easier if you come with some of your own passport photos and your visa forms downloaded from ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.nepalimmigration.gov.np\/ Nepal Immigration"]}]}," and already completed. You may be given an immigration card on your flight but you will still need the long form visa application that you can get either on-line or in the arrivals hall at the airport. Don't bother joining any queues until you have your application form, your passport photos and your visa fees in hand.\n\nVisitors may want to complete currency exchanges in the city closer to where they are staying. Thamel, for example, has many currency exchange booths where rates are competitive and the service is quick and efficient. Visa fees can be paid at the airport in most major currencies, with US dollars preferred.\n\nOutside the airport, all 'representatives' of the tourist industry are required to remain 10m from the front door. Many will be waving large signs and yelling in an attempt to encourage you to choose them as your guide\/taxi\/hotel\/luggage carrier. Make your choice ",{"type":"'''","value":["before"]}," crossing the line. Be aware that as you leave the immigration section of the airport and collect your luggage, someone with a luggage cart is very likely to approach and assist you. Unless you insist on handling your own bags and luggage cart, this person will accompany you to the exit doors from the terminal and to your transportation and will then expect a tip.  It's useful to have some small denomination bills or coins, even in a foreign currency, that you can use for a tip. Many visitors might arrive with only travellers cheques or large denomination bills, making tipping difficult.\n\nIf possible, arrange your first night's accommodation before you arrive and ask the hotel to send someone to meet you. Many hotel and guest houses offer complimentary airport transportation. If you have made arrangements with a trekking agency it is possible that they will collect you from the airport as part of the package. If you have made such arrangements, someone from your hotel or trekking agency will be displaying a sign so they can be identified. Either of these two latter options are good choices if you are new to Nepal and especially if you are arriving late at night and are not familiar with the city or how things in Nepal work.\n\nFixed price",{"type":"'''","value":["Taxis"]}," can be arranged before you exit the building, but you may get a cheaper fare if you are willing to negotiate. The best practice is to agree on the price beforehand with the driver. A taxi ride to Thamel or Boudha should be under NPR500 but this can be quite variable. Otherwise, order a taxi at the pre-paid booth inside the airport. This will likely be more than a negotiated rate outside, but it might save time.\n\nThe only other situation that might complicate your transportation to the city is a strike (bandh). These are less common now than they used to be some years ago, but one such strike was called by a coalition of political parties during the week leading up to the Nov 2013 elections.  Strikes seem to affect taxis less later in the evening than during the day and, in any case, if you're arriving, there is little you can do aside from sorting it out when you get here. When you're leaving, it's a good idea to be aware if any strikes have been called and try to make arrangements. An early morning or evening trip to the airport may be a possible solution. Your hotel or trekking company may also be able to help.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car or motorcycle"]},"\nIt's quite easy to rent a car with a driver in Nepal; however, you'll need to haggle to get a reasonable price.

The roads are amazing and the new east-west highway currently under construction with support from the Japanese will open up new destinations for those interested in exploring Nepal by motor-bike.\n\nPlease check before hiring a motorbike on the current state of fuel. In late 2009 there were problems with fuel supply which can leave riders stranded. Bike hire should cost around NPR500 a day (Pulsar, Hero Honda, scooter) unless you are hiring an Royal Enfield.\n\nHire firms are also notorious for trying to charge tourists large amounts of money for 'damage' that may not have done by you on returning the bike. Therefore, make sure a thorough damage assessment is carried out before departing and, if the hirer tries to scam you on return, go to the local police.\n\nThe best route to explore Nepal by road on motorcycle, is to enter from the border crossing of Banbasa- Mahendra Nagar, just after the border crossing, the Mahendra Highway (made with collaboration from India) is amazing to ride on.\n\nCrossing the border requires you to pay a daily toll of NPR120 and a transport permit of NPR50 (one time), the police can ask you for these two documents any time during your ride.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nThere are Five border crossings open to tourists.

Because Hindus hold cattle to be sacred, beef is forbidden but still can be obtained for a high price in some expensive restaurants although the price is high mainly because it is imported from India. Buffalo and yak are eaten by some but considered too cow-like by others. Pork is eaten by some tribes, but not by upper-caste Hindus. Similar to India there are some communities and tribes who are vegetarians.\n\nOutside the main morning and evening meals, a variety of snacks may be available. Tea, made with milk and sugar is certainly a pick-me-up.  Corn may be heated and partially popped, although it really isn't popcorn. This is called \"kha-jaa\", meaning \"eat and run\"  Rice may be heated and crushed into \"chiura\" resembling uncooked oatmeal that can be eaten with yogurt, hot milk and sugar, or other flavourings.

Otherwise flies land in the human waste that is everywhere in the streets, then on your food, and so you become a walking medical textbook of gastrological conditions.\n\nBecause of the multi-ethnic nature of Nepali society, differing degrees of adherence to Hindu dietary norms, and the extreme range of climates and micro-climates throughout the country, different ethnic communities often have their own specialties.\n\nNewars, an ethnic group originally living in the Kathmandu Valley, are connoisseurs of great foods who lament that feasting is their downfall, whereas sexual indulgence is said to be the downfall of Pahari Chhetri.  In the fertile Kathmandu and Pokhara valleys this cuisine often includes a greater variety of foodstuffs -- particularly vegetables -- than what are available in most of the hills. As such, Newari cuisine is quite distinct and diverse relatively compared to the other indigenous regional cuisines of Nepal, so watch out for Newari restaurants. Some of them even come with cultural shows: a good way to enjoy good food while having a crash-course in Nepalese culture. \n\nThe cuisine of the Terai lowlands is almost the same as in adjacent parts of India. Locally-grown tropical fruits are sold alongside subtropical and temperate temperate crops from the hills.  In addition to bananas ('kera') and papayas ('mewa') familiar to travellers, jackfruit ('katar') is a local delicacy.\n\nSome dishes, particularly in the Himalayan region, are Tibetan in origin and not at all spicy.

The Nepali school system, which many children only attend for a few years, requires English fluency so there is always a demand for native English speakers of all ages, races and nationalities.

Be aware that many schools, especially private ones, charge families higher fees if \"foreign teachers present\" and often locally available English teachers may not be able to find work because of the number of foreign mostly illegally engaged foreign volunteers, many of whom may be illegally employed.\n\nIf you want to teach, a school may request and obtain a non tourist visa for you so you can teach legally. \n\nThere are many options for finding volunteer opportunities. Several international volunteer organizations, will find you a project, room and boarding, either at the school or with a local family for a fee. This \"fee\" can range from 500USD to 2000USD depending on the type and length of program. Often only little of that money will go to the school and host family, often they are too poor even to support a volunteer, so the bulk often goes to the agency. \n\nSome organisations will provide language and culture lessons as well as general teaching supplies and support. Once you make a deposit on a particular program there may be limited options for change. Programs can last from two weeks to five months if made in tourist visa, but keep in mind a regular, legal work and a longer stay may be more rewarding for both you and the school, as it can take several weeks to get into the swing of things.  Above all, examine carefully how your money is spent and who really benefits.\n\nAn alternative to paid placement is to find a local, grassroots program, or to contact schools directly in Kathmandu when you arrive. Local hostels and restaurants usually have bulletin boards full of often doubtful requests for volunteers. More and more local groups are placing ads on the web as well. These programs are more likely to charge only for room and board, but you will need to do some research to find out the specifics of each group and what, if any, support you will receive. Waiting until you arrive also lets you get to know the areas you can volunteer in and allows you to shop around for a situation that best suits you. These placements tend to be longer term (3-5 months), but this is always negotiable with a specific school or project.\n\nAlways check if your engagement does not take away work of other people and that your volunteer work is done legally and that the community profits from the deal. Report to police or other serious NGO\/INGO any kind of misuse. Always demand written receipts with complete organisation address, stamp and signatures.

However without proper antivenin numbness can progress to deadly paralysis, even with bites from small, seemingly harmless specimens.

Micro SIMs can be cut for free if you need. Ncell offers two different SIM cards. The first is a usual SIM card that allows you to make calls to any phone (local calls are about NPR2.5\/min), and you can also buy mobile data to use. The second is a data only SIM card, and can not be used for making or receiving calls. The advantage to the second sim being the rates for data are significantly cheaper than a call and data SIM.
