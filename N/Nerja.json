It is the first resort town going away from Malaga to not be dominated by large ugly concrete hotels and is situated in the attractive foothills of the Sierra Almijara mountains.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nDon't be misled by the tourist brochure descriptions of Nerja as a fishing village. Tourism is this town's main industry and the few fishermen with their boats still to be seen along the beach provide a picturesque scene for visitors and a slim livelihood for local families. Until the last decade the town retained a strong Spanish identity, but during recent years the influx of both northern European visitors and residents has eroded significantly the genuine charm of a truly Spanish working town.\n\nThat said, compared to many other Costa Del Sol destinations, especially to the west of Malaga, Nerja is still very much worth a visit. It is a quiet town with a central historical area that still feels like a village, and the tourist mix is not exclusively northern European as many Spanish people use this resort for holidays, together with French and Italians. Unsurprisingly, the relative peacefulness of the town along with the absence of high rise developments along the coast or noisy nightclubs means many British people have retired here.\n\nThe town is built on a hillside with a not too steep gradient and the sprawling centre itself consists of an older part with white streets partly pedestrianized mainly to the east of the Balcon de Europa, the natural focus of the town and the venue for fiestas, but beyond the 17th century church and the Plaza Cavana more modern development takes over and it is in these areas that the town seems like any other recently developed Spanish Costa resort.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Nerja map.png"],["thumb"],["right"],["400px"],["Map of Nerja"]]},"\nThere is no plane, boat or train service to Nerja - the nearest city you can access with these modes of transport is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Malaga"]]}," to the west. The train station in Malaga is across the street from the bus station, where you catch a bus to Nerja. The port in Malaga serves cruise ships from North Africa (alternatively, there is a seaport in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Almeria"]]}," to the east).\n\nFrom Malaga Airport, which is served by flights from across Europe and America, you can drive along the A-7 E-15 motorway in the direction of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Almeria"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Motril"]]},", hire a taxi to Nerja (which will run you anything from €78-100, or you can prebook a taxi with Nerja Taxis ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.nerjataxis.net"]}," for around €69), or Pre-Book your Malaga Airport Transfers with malaga cabbie ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.malagacabbie.com"]}," for €65 a really good bargain or you can take a bus to the Malaga bus station and transfer to a Nerja-bound bus there.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nThe bus stop in Nerja is on Avenida de Pescia, between a large roundabout and a bridge with blue railings. There's no facilities - it's just a ticket booth with benches, with taxis occasionally parking across the street. The stop is about a 10 minute walk inland from the Balcony of Europe and serves buses along the coast and to the major Andalusian cities. From Malaga there is non-stop service available and a trip will cost less than €5. Alternatively, there is another bus stop a few miles outside Nerja proper serving the Nerja caves.\n\nNerja has buses to many other places in southern Spain, but some as little as one bus a day. ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.nerjatoday.com\/nerja\/bus-timetables\/"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nThe A-7 E-15 motorway runs parallel to the coast, with Nerja situated about a 10 minute drive from the clearly marked freeway exit. Be aware that the long Torrox tunnel you will drive through has cameras at both ends to calculate your speed and fines for speeding are harsh.\n\nEven in the winter months, street parking can be very difficult in the town's narrow and sometimes one-way streets, so use one of the two large central carparks instead - One is situated off Calle La Cruz, right in the middle of town, which charges a reasonable rate per hour. The other is a larger car park off Prol Carabeo, a 5 minute walk from the town centre and the one most often used by locals but very expensive for visitors.\n\nThe town has a  number of roundabouts. Be aware that the Spanish are taught to drive around the outside of a roundabout, even when going all the way around, and have the right of way when they do so. This leads to them cutting across the path of tourists on the inside who think they have the right of way. Also many people tend to step out onto crossings without even looking so always be prepared to stop at a crossing.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nWalking is the easiest way. The centre of Nerja is small enough to be able to walk around on foot though you will find yourself walking up or down a sometimes gradual, sometimes steep hill much of the time. As the town has no specific center, shops, banks, bars and eateries are scattered throughout the town.\n\nThere is a bus from the beach near the Monica hotel which takes you uphill as far as the Sol supermarket. Next stop is about a mile out of town, before returning on the same route. Another bus from the same stop takes you uphill then along the N340 and past where the Tuesday and Sunday market is held (it stops there on the way there and back so gets very crowded on market days). Do not get them mixed up.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Balconyofeurope nerja.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["350px"],["The Balcony of Europe"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["The ",{"type":"'''","value":["Balcony of Europe"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["Balcón de Europa"]},") is a recently reconstructed promenade built out onto a natural headland in the centre of town with spectacular views along the coast.

Granted, for all the attention tourist guides give to this place there's not much to do except look up and down the coast, but the views are spectacular.
