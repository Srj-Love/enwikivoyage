Some people from other provinces may be offended by the usage, though it is common enough that many have learned to tolerate it.\n \nAfter the Eighty Years' War that led to the country's independence from Spain in 1581, the Netherlands became a great naval power and one of the world's most powerful nations in a period known as the Dutch Golden Age. Because of its naval history, this small nation boasts a wealth of cultural heritage visible in many towns across the country. This period also constituted a cultural peak that produced renowned painters like Rembrandt and Vermeer.\n\nOver the course of centuries, the Netherlands has gained a reputation for tolerance and progressivism: the country was the first in the world to legalize same-sex marriage and Dutch people generally have an open attitude to cannabis and prostitution. As a founding member of the EU and NATO and host to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the Netherlands is at the heart of international cooperation. \n\nWith its international airport ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Schiphol Airport"],["Schiphol"]]}," and its advanced network of motorways and international high speed train lines, it is easy to reach from all across the globe.

In 1830 Belgium seceded and formed a separate kingdom. During the liberal revolutions of 1848, a new constitution was adopted and the Netherlands became a constitutional monarchy. The personal union with Luxembourg ended in 1890 as Salic Law prohibited a female ruler.\n\nThe Netherlands remained neutral in World War I, but suffered a brutal invasion and occupation by Germany in World War II. A modern, industrialized nation, the Netherlands is a large exporter of agricultural products. In 1944, the Low Countries formed the union of the Benelux in which they economically (and sometimes politically) work together. The country was a founding member of NATO in 1949 and the European Community (EC) in 1957, and participated in the introduction of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in 1999.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Attitudes"]},"\nQuite a few travellers visit the Netherlands to enjoy its famously tolerant attitude (more or less true especially for the centres of larger cities), which includes relaxed treatment of marijuana use, legal prostitution, a right to euthanasia under strict conditions, and just about complete acceptance of gays and lesbians, including a right to marry one's same-sex partner.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Geography"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Kinderdijk11.JPG"],["350px"],["thumbnail"],["Kinderdijk windmills"]]},"\nThe Netherlands is one of the most densely populated countries in the world.

Otherwise, just visit the official local 'tourist shops', known as the VVV (run partially by volunteers), found in all the cities. On the other hand, tourists who take a bicycle may be surprised by what they might find on the quite lovely cycle paths. \n\nThe geography of the Netherlands is dominated by water features. The country is criss-crossed with rivers, canals and dikes, and the beach is never far away. The western coast has extensive sandy beaches, attracting many visitors from as far afield as Germany.\n\nSince the 17th century, about 20% of the entire country has been reclaimed from the sea, lakes, marshes and swamps.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Ice Skating Fun (6861180671).jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Ice skating in Groningen"]]},"\nThe Netherlands has a temperate climate, which generally means that summers are cool and winters mild.

Frost can occur until the start of May, but temperatures exceeding 20°C are not uncommon either. The sun shines 4 to 7 hours a day on average, increasing throughout the season. Although spring is the driest season (and April is the driest month), always prepare yourself for some rain.\n\nIn summer, the temperature rises generally to above 20°C and frequently to 25°C. Colder weather is mostly combined with rain. Temperatures in excess of 30°C are not unknown, and occur for a few days most summers. A heat wave usually ends with a thunderstorm. The sun shines 7 hours a day on average.\n\nIn autumn, temperatures decrease, but in September and October, the temperature is still a pleasant 15-19°C, sometimes exceeding 25°C in September. Rain is abundant, and the number of sunshine hours decrease markedly. In November, frost is more common and temperatures at daytime fluctuates around 9°C, but freezing daytimes and snow are not unheard of. Autumn mornings are quite foggy.\n\nIn Winter, temperatures are around 0-6°C most of the time, although frosty periods occur each winter, generally down to -5°C, but frosts of -10°C are common too.

If a user fails to check out, the checking-in fee, which is higher than the fare for most actual journeys, is not refunded.\nLoading travel credit can be done at station ticket machines, at ticket offices and some tobacco shops and supermarkets.\nDuring a trip, personnel can check cards with a mobile card reader.

Card readers are placed near each door for this purpose.\n\nChecking in and out is always required, except when you transfer from one train to another from the same operator. Changing trains from one operator to a different operator requires checking out at a card reader of the first operator and checking in at a card reader of the second operator.

There are two main types of trains: Intercities which only stop at major stations and Sprinters which stop at all stations. All types of train have the same prices. Also, there are high-speed trains called 'Intercity Direct' between Amsterdam and Breda, which only requires a supplement ticket between Schiphol and Rotterdam. Travelling all the way from the north of the country (Groningen) to the south (Maastricht) takes approximately 4 hours.\n\nThe ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.spoorkaart2014.nl\/downloads\/spoorkaart_2014_A4.pdf Spoorkaart"]}," is an map of the railway system and shows all services. Connections with only one train per hour are shown in thinner lines.\n\nMost lines offer one train every 15 minutes (every 10 min during the rush hours), but some rural lines run only every 60 min. Where more lines run together, the frequency is, of course, even higher. In the western Netherlands, the rail network is more like a large urban network, with up to 12 trains per hour on main routes. \n\nThe ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ns.nl\/en\/travellers\/home Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS)"]}," operates most routes. Some local lines are operated by Syntus, Arriva, Veolia and Connexxion.\n\nBecause of the high service frequency, delays are quite common. However, the delay is usually not more than 5 or 10 minutes. Trains can be crowded, especially in the morning rush hour. Reserving seats on domestic trains is only possible on the Intercity Direct.\n\nOne particular mistake tourists often make is getting on the wrong part of a train. Many trains consist of two parts with different destinations. Somewhere on the way to the final destination, both parts will be separated and will continue on their own to their respective destinations. In that case, the signs over the platforms will show two destinations and which part goes where: ",{"type":"''","value":["achterste deel\/achter"]}," means back and ",{"type":"''","value":["voorste deel\/voor"]}," means front, referring to the direction of departure. Feel free to ask other passengers or an employee.\n\nAnother frequently made mistake involves travelling from Schiphol to Amsterdam. From Schiphol you can go to either Amsterdam Centraal or Amsterdam Zuid (South). These railway stations are not connected directly and many tourists with the idea of going to Amsterdam Centraal wind up at South. Therefore always check the destination of the train. From Amsterdam Zuid you can take the metro to Centraal, or a train to Centraal with an interchange at station Duivendrecht (2nd floor).\n\nThere is a convenient night train service (for party-goers and airport traffic) between Rotterdam, Delft, The Hague, Leiden, Schiphol, Amsterdam, and Utrecht, all night long, once an hour in each direction. In the nights F-Sa and Sa-Su, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North-Brabant"]]}," is also served. You can get to Dordrecht, 's-Hertogenbosch, Eindhoven, Tilburg, and Breda.\n\nMost trains have two comfort classes (1e klasse and 2e klasse). Some regional lines don't have first class. First class and second class are usually distinguished by different colour schemes. Signs with either \"1\" or \"2\" next to outside doors and carriage doors indicate class.\nSome zones in train are silent zones. Noise is to be kept to a minimum in these areas. They are indicated either by a stylised face in silhouette holding a finger to the lips, or a yellow oval with \"Ssst\".\n\nFree Wi-Fi is available at almost all major train stations and in many Intercity trains. Electrical outlets are only available in a few Intercity trains, and then only in First Class. \n\n",{"type":"=====","value":["Buying train tickets"]},"\nThere is one national tariff system for train travel. You don't need separate tickets for other operators. All train companies in the Netherlands now use the OV-chipkaart: paper train tickets are no longer issued.

Tickets are valid on both sprinter and intercity services; there is no difference in price. However, for domestic travel with Intercity Direct or ICE trains, you will need a surcharge which you can buy at the ticket machine, to be used directly. With Intercity Direct, this fee is only needed when travelling between Schiphol and Rotterdam.  The most used tickets are the single (",{"type":"''","value":["enkele reis"]},") and return tickets (",{"type":"''","value":["retour"]},"). The latter is valid only for a return on the day itself, but the price is equal to two singles, therefore a return offers no price advantage over buying singles (except when using a disposable OV-chipkaart).\n\nTickets are valid in any train on the route (as opposed to being valid in only one fixed train). It is allowed to break at any station on the route (even on stations on the route where you don't have to change). Like in many countries, there is a difference between first and second class. A second class ticket is about 60% of the price of a first class ticket. The main advantage of first class is that it is less crowded, and seats and aisles are generally wider. For children 4–11 years accompanied by adults, a Railrunner ticket can be bought for €2.50.\n\nTickets may be purchased in advance online (\"e-tickets\") ",{"type":"[","value":["https:\/\/www.ns.nl\/eticket\/ticket?language=en"]},", although a Dutch bank account for payment (iDEAL) is necessary.

Only larger stations have a ticket counter. The ticket machines have English-language menus available. A common mistake made by foreigners is accidentally getting a 40% discount ('korting') ticket from the machine. A special discount-card is required for these tickets, although you can travel on other people's discount cards too. (See ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Discount rail pass"],["Discount rail pass"]]},").

It is important to note the validity of such tickets (e.g. not valid during morning rush hours, and valid for all days or just Saturday-Sunday, and the time period for which they are valid). Using one of those tickets is probably the cheapest way to get around in the Netherlands by train, especially for round trips.\n\n",{"type":"=====","value":["In the station"]},"\nMost stations are small with only one or two platforms. Stops at towns or villages in general aren't provided with railway staff. However cities like Amsterdam and Utrecht have large central stations with up to 14 platforms. It can take 5, maybe even 10 minutes to move from one platform to another, especially for people who not familiar with the station.\n\nThe platforms are all numbered. When platforms are so long that two or more trains can halt at the same platform, the different parts of the platform are indicated with the lowercase letters a\/b\/c. On some stations, capital letters are used to indicate which part of the train stops at which part of the station. Do not confuse the lower case and upper case letters.\n\nTime tables can be found in the station hall and on the platforms. All train tables are normally yellow, with exceptions for the different schedules during planned maintenance works (blue) and queen's day (orange). Departing trains are printed in blue (on yellow tables), arriving train tables in red. Unlike in other countries, the tables themselves are not ordered by time of departure, but by direction (Please notice this is actually by line, from bigger stations some cities are reach by several lines! Tourists better ask someone, which line is fastest for your destination.). In some cases, more than one table is necessary to cover a single day for a certain direction. Additionally, most stations have blue electronic screens, indicating the trains departing during the next hour.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["By bus"]},"\nThe network of regional and local buses in the Netherlands is fine-grained and frequent and usually connects well with the train network; by bus travellers can reach most small villages easily. However, for long-distance travel, these regional buses are not convenient and much slower than the train.\n\nFast long-distance buses are only available on a small number of routes that aren't covered by the rail network; these buses have special names that differ by region, such as ",{"type":"''","value":["Q-liner,"]}," ",{"type":"''","value":["Brabantliner"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["Interliner"]}," and special tariffs.\n\nThere are four main bus companies in the Netherlands, ",{"type":"''","value":["Connexxion,"]}," ",{"type":"''","value":["Veolia,"]}," ",{"type":"''","value":["Arriva"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["Qbuzz."]}," A few large cities have their own bus company.\n\nA cheap way to get across the Netherlands is to buy a \"buzzer\" ticket. It costs €10 a day, and is valid after 9AM on every single Connexxion bus for two adults and up to three children. On weekends and holidays it is also valid before 09:00. Because Connexxion have a wide-spread network, you can get from Groningen to Zeeland this way in a day, and it undercuts the train. A big downside though is that bus lines are very indirect. For example, getting from Amsterdam to Rotterdam, would require three or more changes. In short: bus journeys will almost always take longer than train travel. For example, trip to Rotterdam from Utrecht will take 40 minutes, but in the Bus it will take 1.5 hr. However, if you want to enjoy the countryside and villages you can prefer the bus trips.\n\nMany companies and regions have their own bus discount tickets, which are often cheaper than using credit on the OV-chipkaart.\n\nPark-and-ride-(travel-)tickets: some towns and cities have special cheaper bus tickets from car parks near the city limits to the city centre, for outside rush hours, usually a return ticket.\n\n",{"type":"=====","value":[" Night buses "]},"\nAmsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht offer public transport at night.

All these factors plus many more additional facilities such as numerous picnic places, terraces, small ferry-connections and camping places, makes it often preferable to discover the country by bike rather than by car. \n\nThe proliferation of bicycles also means that you're seen as a significant part of the traffic mix - motorists will let you know if you don't keep to the rules and presume you are aware of other traffic.

They often simply offer them for sale to passers-by, if they think no police are watching. Buying a stolen bike is itself illegal, and police do arrest buyers.

Drive on the right. \n\nThe motorway\/highway network is rather extensive, though heavily used. Congestion, especially during peak hour, is usual and can better be avoided. Roads are well signposted and many times provided with new technologies. A Motorway\/highway (",{"type":"''","value":["Autosnelweg"]},") is indicated with a letter A\/number combination which is placed in a red box. In the less urbanised parts, such as the Southwest and the North, motorways\/highways are few. Many times connections there are made by a semi highway called ",{"type":"''","value":["Autoweg"]},", or another N way. All these connections are indicated with a letter N\/number combination in a yellow box. Most times motorist will automaticly be directed to the nearest A or N road.

Leased (business) cars and rental cars are usually serviced by the ANWB services included in the lease\/rental price; but you may want to check any provided booklets.\n\nRoad signs with directions are plenty, but having a map is useful, especially in cities where there are many one way streets, and getting from one part of the city to another is not always so straightforward. Be careful not to drive on bus lanes, often indicated with markings such as ",{"type":"''","value":["Lijnbus"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["Bus"]},", nor on cycling paths, marked by the picture of a bicycle, or by a reddish colour of the asphalt.

It's better to fill your vehicle before entering the Netherlands, since the Belgian and German fuel prices can be €0.30 lower per litre. Unmanned gas stations, such as TanGo or Firezone, save up to 10 cents, but are still far more expensive than their Belgian counterparts. Prices of fuel are, as of 2012, €1.84 ($2.20) a litre in manned stations. Along highways many gas stations are open 24\/7. More and more unmanned gas stations can be found, even along highways, selling petrol cheaper. These unattended stations accept all common debit and credit cards. All gas stations sell both petrol and diesel; the \"premium\" brands have the same octane level (they allegedly contain compounds that improve fuel efficiency to offset the higher price). Liquid Petroleum Gas is sold at relatively many gas stations along the high ways, but it is never sold in built-up areas. The symbol for LPG gas is a green-coloured gaspump-icon, set beside the general case black-coloured gaspump-icon. LPG fueled cars need regular petrol to start the motor, and can also be operated using strictly petrol, though it is more expensive.\n\nIf you come in the Netherlands with your LPG fueled car, probably you will need an adaptor.

There is a maximum tariff, and it's built into the taxi meters. If you negotiate a price before you get in, the price you have to pay is the negotiated price, or the metered price, whichever is lower.

In the eastern provinces of Groningen, Overijsel, Drenthe and Gelderand people speak a local variety of Low Saxon (Grunnegs or Tweants for example).

In areas bordering Germany, German is widely spoken. However, outside of the eastern provinces, many people (especially among the younger generation) can also speak basic German too.

However, with much of the country's land below sea level, the water also caused terrible floods and great losses over centuries.\n\nDutch attempts to protect their lands with dikes are well recorded from the 12th century, but started around 2,000 years ago. An enormous flood in 1287 created the large Zuiderzee, an inland sea that is now known as the IJsselmeer. From that period onwards, a long process of reclaiming lands lost to the sea began. Windmills and extensive networks of dikes were created to pump out the water, slowly creating the characteristic polders. One of these polders is the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beemster"],["Beemster Polder"]]},", and when you visit you get a few fortifications of the Defence Line of Amsterdam included as a bonus.\n\nAfter another devastating flood in 1916, the country started the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Zuiderzee Works"]},", a massive undertaking to reclaim and tame the Zuiderzee once and for all.

",{"type":"''","value":["Hutspot"]}," is a variety with carrots and onions.\n\nDutch cuisine differs strongly by region. Western cuisine is known for its many dairy products, including prominent ",{"type":"'''","value":["cheeses"]}," such as Gouda, Edam, Leerdammer and Beemster.

As such, it is renowned for its many rich pastries, soups, stews and vegetable dishes. It is the only Dutch region which developed an ",{"type":"'''","value":["haute cuisine"]}," that forms the base of most traditional Dutch restaurants.

Tipping is not mandatory and seen as a sign of appreciation, not as means to make up a tiny salary. In case you do want to tip, as a rule of thumb rounding up to the next euro is normal or 10 percent. Going to a restaurant is generally seen as a special night out with friends or family, not as a quick way to eat food. As such, dining with Dutch people can take a couple of hours.\n\nSmoking is banned in all restaurants, cafes, bars, festival tents and nightclubs. Smoking is allowed only outside or in separate, enclosed, designated smoking areas in which employees are not allowed to serve.

Typical dishes are fried rice (",{"type":"''","value":["nasi goreng"]},"), fried bakmi (",{"type":"''","value":["bami goreng"]},") and prawn crackers (",{"type":"''","value":["kroepoek"]},"). A suggestion is the famous Dutch-Indonesian ",{"type":"''","value":["rijsttafel"]},", which is a combination of several small dishes from the East Indies, not unlike the ",{"type":"''","value":["nasi padang"]}," of Indonesia.

They often have police-style uniforms to confer some authority, but their powers are limited.

The same report points out a \"dramatic growth of Islamophobia\" paralleled with antisemitism.

The purchase of other (hard) drugs such as  ecstasy, cocaine, or processed\/dried mushrooms is still dealt with by the law. However, often people who are caught in possession of small amounts of illegal drugs for personal use are not prosecuted.\n\nThe act of consuming any form of drugs is legal, even if possession is not. If you are seen taking drugs, you may theoretically be arrested for possession, but not for use. This has one important effect; do not hesitate to seek medical help if you are suffering from bad effects of drug use, and inform emergency services as soon as possible of the specific (illegal) drugs you have taken. Medical services are unconcerned with where you got the drugs, they will not contact the police, their sole intention is to take care of you in the best way possible.\n\nAt some parties, a \"drug testing desk\" is offered, where you can have your (synthetic) drugs tested. This is mainly because many pills contain harmful chemicals in addition to the claimed ingredients; for example, many pills of \"ecstasy\" (MDMA) will also contain speed (amphetamines). Some pills don't even contain any MDMA at all. The testing desks are not meant to encourage drug use, since venue owners face stiff fines for allowing drugs in their venues, but they are tolerated or 'gedoogd' since they mitigate the public health risks. Note: the desk won't return the drugs tested.\n\nPlease note that there are significant risks associated with drug use:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" While marijuana bought at coffeeshops is unlikely to be hazardous, hard drugs like cocaine and heroin and synthetic drugs like ecstasy are still illegal and unregulated.

Alcohol and weed amplify each other: a little bit of alcohol can cause you to intensely feel the effect of the weed, but a tiny bit too much can make you feel dizzy and\/or nauseated.\n\nThe use of drugs is condemned, disapproved and sometimes feared by many Dutch people, notwithstanding the legal nature of it.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Prostitution"]},"\n\nProstitution in the Netherlands is legal since 1988 if the prostitute consents. Pimping or otherwise exploiting women against their will is a crime, even in the Netherlands. Have sex only in safe locations that have a license to host prostitutes to engage in sexual activities with their clientele.\n\nIllegal prostitution in hotels can be raided by the police and the client as well as the prostitute can be fined or be put in jail. Hotel personnel are obliged by law to notify the police if they suspect these kinds of illegal activities. Having sex with a minor (18 for prostitutes, 16 for other people) is also illegal. Always ask for an ID from the prostitute to confirm her age.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\n\nThe Netherlands has some of the best 'tap water' in the world.

Food (either bought in a supermarket or eaten at a restaurant) shouldn't pose any problem either.\n\nThe health care system of the Netherlands is up to par with the rest of Europe.

Nevertheless, the standards for ",{"type":"''","value":["overt"]}," rudeness and hostility are similar to those in other western European countries.\n\nThe exception to this openness is personal wealth. For instance, it's considered vulgar to reveal how rich you are, so asking somebody about this will be considered nosy and will probably just get you an evasive answer. \n\nLikewise, it's not advisable to be forceful about your own religion or to assume a Dutch person you've met is a Catholic or a Calvinist, since most people do not adhere to any faith at all. In urban areas it's not considered rude to ask somebody about this, but you'll generally be expected to be entirely tolerant of whatever the other person believes and not attempt to proselytize in any way. Openly religious behaviour is usually met with bewilderment and ridicule rather than hostility. An exception is the Dutch Bible Belt which runs from Zeeland into South Holland, Utrecht and Gelderland, and consists of towns with many strong Dutch Reformed Christians, who are more likely to be insulted by different religious views. \n\nOpenly nationalist sentiments are likewise viewed with some suspicion among the general public, although there are a number of celebrations like Queen's Day (",{"type":"''","value":["Koninginnedag"]},", 30 April) and during football championships. Some people dress in orange and\/or get drunk, but you don't have to fear hostility to foreigners.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Social etiquette"]},"\nIn the Netherlands, cheek-kissing is a common way of greeting among women and between women and men. Two men will generally shake hands. Kissing is particularly suitable for informal occasions, and is also common practice when congratulating someone. Hand shaking is more appropriate for formal occasions. Trying to shake hands when offered a kiss or refusing a kiss altogether could be considered odd or rude.\n\nDutch people will kiss three times alternating right and left cheeks. This could lead to awkward situations for British people and many other Europeans, being used to just two kisses. Also, always kiss on the cheeks instead of giving air-kisses.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Gay and lesbian travellers"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Gay Pride Amsterdam 2009c.jpg"],["thumb"],["Gay Pride in Amsterdam"]]},"\nAs mentioned above, the Netherlands is quite liberal when it comes to ",{"type":"'''","value":["homosexuality"]}," and by far is considered to be ",{"type":"'''","value":["one of the gay-friendliest countries in the world."]}," The Netherlands has a reputation of being the first country to recognise same-sex marriage, and openly displaying your orientation wouldn't cause much upset in the Netherlands.

Don't get mistaken by Dutch using 'gay' ('homo') as a swearword, as this doesn't mean, in many cases, that they oppose homosexuality. They just don't want to be too serious about it. Recent polls indicate that more than 90% of Dutch people think homosexuality is moral and should be accepted, though only 25% to 30% of ethnic Turks and Moroccans in the Netherlands agree with this.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Location and language"]},"\nOutside the provinces of North and South Holland (and probably Utrecht and Flevoland), it's considered disrespectful to speak as if you're in Holland.

However, do not confuse the two countries!

The cell phone networks are operated by KPN, Vodafone and T-Mobile; other operators use one of these 3 networks. The networks are high quality and cover every corner of the Netherlands. If you're bringing your own (GSM) cell phone to call (or receive calls) whilst in The Netherlands, make sure to check the relevant \"roaming\" charges for your provider, as they vary substantially. Receiving phone calls on a cell phone using a Dutch SIM card is free in most cases; charges apply if you're using a foreign SIM card, as the call is theoretically routed through your country of origin. It may be cheaper to buy a pay-as-you-go SIM card to insert into your GSM phone, or even to buy a very cheap pay-as-you-go card+phone bundle.

Most dial-around services offer USA, Canada, Western Europe and many other countries at the price of a local call so you can save on your phone expenses easily. They also work from public payphones.\n\nThere are few public phone booths left in the Netherlands. They are mostly found at train stations. Telfort booths accept coins, whereas most KPN booths accept only prepaid cards or credit cards. Some new public phones have been installed which accept coins again. Note that tariffs (per unit or amount of calling time) can differ between public phones in a truly public area and the same types of machines in a more public-private area.\n\n0800 numbers are toll-free while 09xx numbers are charged at premium rates. Mobile phones have numbers in the 06 range, and calls to cell phones are also priced at higher rates.
