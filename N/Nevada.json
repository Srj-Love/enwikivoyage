The Park Service offers developed campgrounds where fees are charged and no-fee primitive campgrounds.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Hiking"]},"\nMost of Nevada lies within the Basin-and-Range geographic province, so there are literally hundreds of mountain ranges.  Some ranges are short, ten miles (15 km) or so, but others are over a hundred miles (160 km) long.  Several ranges have well developed trails, however others are just beginning to be discovered by enthusiastic hikers, who often make their own routes from backcountry jeep roads, cattle or game trails, desert washes, and crosscountry travel which the lack of dense forests makes fairly straightforward.  Perhaps not the place for novices to venture alone, however intermediate hikers will find abundant opportunities.\n\nThe highest peaks over 13,000' (4,000m) are right on the California border (Boundary Peak in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["White Mountains (California)"],["White Mountains"]]}," and near the eastern border with Utah (Wheeler Peak in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Great Basin National Park"]]},".  Other ranges scattered all over the state rise into the alpine zone which begins above 11,500' (3,500m) in the south to as little as 9,000' (2,700m) in the north.  Many peaks reaching into the alpine zone have evidence of past glaciation such as cirques, moraines and even glacial tarns (lakes), but Nevada has only one contemporary glacier on Wheeler Peak.\n\nThe driest ranges are those of moderate elevation in the rainshadow of California's Sierra Nevada Mountains which parallels Nevada's southwest border.  Precipitation increases with elevation, to the north where the Sierra and Cascade ranges are lower, and to the east where the rainshadow effect lessens and moisture moving north from the Gulf of California comes into play.  Hikers used to streams and mountain lakes will certainly find them in the Ruby and East Humboldt Ranges in the northeast, and in the Snake Range near Wheeler Peak, however drier ranges have unique landscapes not found in hiking venues elsewhere except perhaps in Central Asia, Africa and Australia.  Dry ranges also have unique flora including open subalpine woodlands of Bristlecone and Limber Pine and lower down of Singleleaf Pinyon Pine which bear nuts that were a dietary mainstay of the Paiute and Shoshone tribes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nRestaurants in and around casinos in Reno, Las Vegas and Tahoe especially cater to the dietary whims of urban California.  Notable chefs have opened restaurants worth a detour from the usual tourist activities.  Buffets in casinos are often heavily subsidized in hopes that those who come to eat will stay to gamble.  The more upscale examples offer surprisingly good food and plenty of it.\n\nOutside of these tourist meccas, food takes on a western character.  This is certainly the rule in small town cafes, but also in casinos along borders with Oregon, Idaho, Utah and Arizona drawing a western clientele with different dietary preferences than Californians.\n\nNevada and other parts of the larger intermountain region export beef and lamb, but are no cornucopia when it comes to fruit and vegetables.  These are produced in very finite quantities because water is scarce and elevations usually high enough to induce late and early frosts.  Accordingly cafes and restaurants with local clienteles serve 'meat and potatoes' fare.  Coffee can be a weak disappointment.  Nevertheless the food can be interesting in a regional way, often making inventive use of a limited range of ingredients.  \n\nChinese immigration drawn by railroad-building and mining opportunities established Chinese-American cuisine even in remote towns.  Urban sophisticates may find it quaintly amusing -- chow mein, sweet-and-sour, egg drop soup, fortune cookies and all.  Basque sheepherders went everywhere green grass could be found.

Privately-owned liquor stores tend to have an extremely comprehensive selection of liquor, beer and wine, especially in Las Vegas. While some bars may close they do so by choice, not by legal necessity. Indeed many Nevada bars have been continuously open every single second for well over 40 years, including holidays.\n\nMost bars feature some sort of casino gaming. Video poker machines are often built right into the bar itself. Indeed it's unusual to not see something like that in a Nevada bar. Bartenders may even offer you free drinks if you're actively playing. \n\nAs with the casinos, Nevada bars tend to take a decidedly cavalier attitude towards smoking; ask first, but chances are its perfectly OK to light up if you so choose.
