A former British colony, these islands became independent from Britain in 1983. St. Kitts and Nevis are separated by a 2-mile wide channel known as \"The Narrows\". Several ferries run every day between Charlestown, the capital of Nevis, and Basseterre, which is the capital of St. Kitts. \n\nNevis is not very commercially developed. It is still a very quiet and relaxing island, and a lot safer than many Caribbean islands. The local people who live on Nevis are kind and welcoming, but Nevisians who don't work with tourists on a regular basis tend to be shy at first. Nevis has one of the highest literacy rates in the world; education and religion are very important aspects of the islanders' lives.\n\nNevis was the birthplace and childhood home of Alexander Hamilton. It was also the place where Horatio Nelson was stationed as a young sea captain and where he met and married his wife, a young plantation widow, Fanny Nisbet.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Regions"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Nevis Aerial.jpg"],["thumb"],["Part of the east coast of Nevis seen from the air"]]},"\n\nNevis is almost round in outline, with a large dormant volcano (known as Nevis Peak) in the middle.  The island divides naturally into three regions: the peak itself, which is so steep that it was never farmed, the coastal plain which rises up towards the central mountain, and hills of various sizes around the island which are the remnants of far more ancient volcanic activity.\n\nThe island of Nevis is also divided administratively into five parishes: Saint George, Gingerland; Saint James, Windward; Saint John, Figtree; Saint Paul, Charlestown; and Saint Thomas, Lowland. Each of these Nevis parishes is shaped like a slice of pie, and they all come together at one point on the top of the mountain. \n\nDuring the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries almost all of the less steep parts of the surface of Nevis were cleared of natural vegetation and the land was completely covered in sugar plantations. Numerous ruins of the old plantation buildings (especially the conical mills where the cane was ground up) are found throughout the landscape of Nevis.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Settlements"]},"\nThere are no cities in Nevis; the settlements are mostly villages. Only the capital counts as a town.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Charlestown"]},", the capital of Nevis, is a small, picturesque port town. The main street is lined with handsome Georgian stone buildings which are examples of the architectural style of the British colonial era, sporting breezy balconies and wooden upper floors over a ground floor built of stone.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Newcastle"]}," is a settlement in the northern part of the island, next to the airport. The Newcastle Pottery makes and sells attractive items from the red clay that is found in that area.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Bath"]}," is situated a little south of Charlestown and features the historic 18th century Bath Hotel, now used as government offices, as well as two outdoor bathing spots where the volcanic hot spring water can be enjoyed free of charge by anyone who wishes to soak their bodies in this extremely hot water, which is full of salts and is considered to have restorative properties.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Nevis Peak"]},", the top of a dormant volcano, is an attraction to hikers and nature buffs. There are various walks and trails on the lower slopes of the Peak, as well as a challenging route that goes all the way to the summit.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["The Nevis Racetrack"]},". Yes, there is horse racing on Nevis! In the southeast of the island, near Indian Castle, is a racetrack with grandstand and concession huts. The races are held infrequently, maybe once a month or so, but they are very exciting for everyone involved. Nevis also has car racing and motorbike racing at the drag racing track, the St. James Raceway.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Nevis Charlestown.jpg"],["thumb"],["Charlestown is the largest settlement on the island"]]},"\nThe people of Nevis who are not in the tourist business tend to be very shy, but are friendly and helpful once you get past the initial shyness, which can take some time. It is appropriate to greet everyone you pass or meet, saying either, \"good morning,\" \"good afternoon,\" or \"good night\" (which is said instead of \"good evening.\")\n\nNevisians in general attend church regularly. Cursing in public is against the law. Provocative dress and rudeness are frowned on. Topless sunbathing is not allowed on the beaches of Nevis.    \n\nMost non-tourist places on Nevis such as banks, grocery stores, and government offices will often have lines. Ferries frequently do not leave on time. Service in local restaurants can be very slow. Local people expect that you will not complain or show irritation about these delays, which are considered normal.\n\nDon't take photos of the local people or their houses without asking their permission first; this is considered to be very rude.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nThe first inhabitants in Nevis were Amerindians who reached Nevis over 2,000 year ago from what is now Venezuela. \n\nChristopher Columbus saw the island but did not land there. The island was given the name \"Nuestra Senora de las Nieves\", meaning \"Our Lady of the Snows\". Captain Barthemow Gilbert was the first recorded European visitor in 1603. In 1628, the British settled on Nevis. In 1629, the island was invaded and taken over by the Spanish. \n\nEventually Nevis became a British colonial holding, valued for its very rich production of sugar, the whole island other than the steep slopes of Nevis Peak was all turned into sugar plantations. By the early 20th century, the sugar industry was going downhill, and eventually all of the sugar mills closed.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nNevis used to be a British colony, and as a result everyone on Nevis speaks English. Local people who do not often deal with tourists (like farmers on the local market) may sometimes be hard to understand because of their strong regional accent, as well as the fact that they use some dialect words and occasional pieces of unfamiliar grammar.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nComing in by air you may have to take two flights to get to Nevis. If you arrive from Europe or the USA, your first flight will take you to one of the Caribbean hubs, an island much larger than Nevis, such as Puerto Rico or maybe St. Maarten. Then you will get on a much smaller plane and fly over to the small airport on Nevis. \n\nSome visitors can instead take a non-stop flight to the sister island of St. Kitts, and then a ferry or water taxi over to Nevis. If you are staying at a hotel in Nevis and arriving in St. Kitts, the hotel staff will make the necessary arrangements for you to get over from St. Kitts to Nevis.\n\nThere are two main ways to get from St. Kitts to Nevis via ferry. If you decide you want to rent a car in St. Kitts, you can then take a car ferry over to Nevis. The car ferry is called the \"Sea Bridge\" and it also takes pedestrians. It leaves every 2 hours during the daytime from Majors Bay, at the extreme tip of the southeastern peninsula of St. Kitts. It is about a 25 minute (very hilly and very scenic) drive from the airport on St. Kitts to Majors Bay. The \"Sea Bridge\" takes about 15 minutes to cross over to Cades Bay on Nevis, a few miles north of Charlestown. If you don't want to rent a car in St. Kitts you can take a taxi to Majors Bay, get on the Sea Bridge and then get a taxi or bus once you are on Nevis. I you want to make things really easy, you can negotiate a taxi to take you all the way from the St. Kitts airport to Majors Bay and onto the \"Sea Bridge\" and off again, all the way to your destination in Nevis. \n\nThe regular ferries all leave from the port in Basseterre, St. Kitts (which is only a short distance from the airport) and arrive at the port in Charlestown, Nevis. They are mostly passenger ferries: only the ferry boat known as the \"Sea Hustler\" can carry vehicles. The ferries from Basseterre have to travel a much longer distance on water than the \"Sea Bridge\", and so they take about 40 minutes, but it's quite a beautiful ride. These ferries can also be used for a day trip over to St. Kitts if you are staying on Nevis. Just bear in mind that the times of departure are approximate (the ferries often leave later than scheduled), and sometimes a ferry run maybe cancelled without prior notice.\n\nPrivate water taxis will also run the route from St. Kitts to Nevis, but are more expensive, although the cost is not at all unreasonable if you can find enough passengers to fill the boat. The Four Seasons has its own boats to take guests from St. Kitts to the resort on Nevis and will take extra passengers if space is available (this cost approximately USD 60 in 2014). All the larger hotels on Nevis will set up the necessary transfers for you in advance if you need to come over from St. Kitts.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Mapframe"],["17.1493"],["-62.5855"],["zoom=13"],["height=750"],["width=620"],["layer=M"],["staticmap=Nevis.JPG"],["align=none"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Taxis"]}," are vans that have ",{"type":"'''","value":["yellow"]}," license plates that ",{"type":"'''","value":["start with T or TA"]},".

Drivers can bring you to your destination and wait for you, or can come back and get you at your convenience. Although a bargain in terms of what you get (really more like a personal limo -- and the charge is the same no matter how many people are coming with you) -- taxis are relatively expensive in absolute amounts (USD10-20 is typical) to go even a rather short distance.

The vans are privately owned, but government-registered. These buses are safe, cheap, extremely convenient, quite fast, and are a fun way to see a little of real life on Nevis. Everyone from old ladies to little kids will be getting on and off. Buses are extremely frequent during early morning and late afternoon, but are not as frequent in the middle of the day; they also do not run at all after about 9 pm. A bus will pick you up anywhere on the main road and drop you off anywhere else on the main road, or even on a side street if you pay a little extra. The buses take people from point to point very inexpensively for around XCD3-5 (USD1-2, depending on how far you are going) per person. Buses generally make circuits on one part of the ring road (the road running around the island) with each van running back and forth on roughly a third of the 17-mile road.  To catch a bus, you just stand on the side of the road anywhere, look for a van going your way whose license plate is green and starts with H, then wave at them with a downwards motion (like saying \"slow down\") as the van is approaching. Occasionally a bus will only beep and drive past, but  that is simply because the bus is already completely full. You can pay when you get on the bus, or on your way out (it is easier and faster if you have EC dollar coins that you can give to the driver). Just tell the driver where you are going. if the bus is very full you may want to call out a reminder when the van is approaching the point where you want to get off. If you want to go somewhere that is far outside the loop that the van is running, the driver will drop you at a point where you will can meet the next bus. Buses are really great: they can save you a lot of money and they give you a taste of local culture."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Car Rentals"]}," are good if you plan to stay for more than a couple of days and want to have more freedom than the buses offer, or want to go to inaccessible places that the buses don't service.

Their fur is olive-green and beige, and because of this, when they are are motionless they are very hard to spot, because they blend in so well with the vegetation. Hundreds of troupes of these monkeys sleep at night in the forest on Nevis Peak. They are usually seen by humans only when a troupe goes out foraging for food in the early morning, or the quiet part of the afternoon, when the monkeys venture into gardens and cultivated areas looking for  not only edible seeds of wild plants but also mangos, tomatoes, and other delicious cultivated items. The tourists find the monkeys exciting and picturesque, but they are considered a nuisance by locals, because they raid farms and gardens mercilessly. During the driest parts of the year troupes of monkeys come all the way down to the coast, travelling on foot in the \"ghauts\" or ravines, and then you might see some of them almost anywhere on the island, although they prefer to stay at a safe distance from people."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Pinney's Beach"]}," on the western (Caribbean) side of the island is a straight sandy beach several miles long which features the Four Seasons Resort, various beach bars, etc."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Oualie Beach"]},", further north on the Caribbean side, this is a very sheltered bay beach with very calm shallow water, a scuba centre, a laid-back hotel, etc."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Golf at The Four Seasons"]},".
