Taxis are also prevalent (but relatively expensive), and the size of the town is such that walking is not out of the question.\n\nDriving is also possible but parking is difficult to find in the downtown area and expensive. Most on-street parking in the downtown area is 2-hour only Monday-Friday, and parking garages tend to run about $1.50-$2 per hour. On-street regulations are suspended on the weekend but most spots are taken by residents. Some garages, such as the Lower Church Street garage, are free on Saturdays if you park before 5:00PM.\n\nTraffic gets unbelievably stuck up after football games and Rutgersfest, with cars and buses often coming to a standstill on Route 18 and in neighboring Piscataway, as well as in downtown New Brunswick.
