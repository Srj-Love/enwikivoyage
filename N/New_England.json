New England's coastal location does somewhat modify continental temperature extremes; but storminess is enhanced by New England's relatively rough topography.  Northern New England winters can seem especially harsh -- if you plan to visit between December and mid-March, be prepared for freezing temperatures, wicked winds, and chills that take a couple of cups of coffee to dent. \"Dress warmly\" is an understatement -- in northern New England \"prepare for nuclear winter\" might be more accurate advice for travellers.  The best advice, though is to dress in layers that include an outer layer to block the wind, plus a sweater or jumper to be removed when exerting oneself.  Generally, the only areas of New England that are somewhat comfortable in the winter are the southern coastlines of Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts, which are warmed by nearby unfrozen salt water.  For the visitor prepared for cold weather, northern New England's deep snows and crisp air can be exhilarating.\n\nThe months of April and May can be New England’s best-kept secret. In southern Vermont you will find off-season rates in many historic inns, but as noted local Robert Frost once so eloquently put it, \"Nature's first Green is Gold.\" The area is bursting with daffodils, tulips & lilacs and the temperatures are mild with cool nights, just perfect. \n\nNew England summers can range from mild to uncomfortably humid. They provide a beach season of mid-June to mid-September. Most warm weather tourist destinations have a season from mid-May to mid-October. Areas right along the shoreline are often cooler and more temperate than inland areas.\n\nNew England shines during autumn. New England foliage is world-renowned for displays that rival pyrotechnics for their intense colors, rapid appearance, and equally rapid disappearance. Peak season ranges from early September at the farthest north points of Maine to early November for Southern Connecticut. Combine that with local festivals, hay rides, fresh-pressed apple cider, and fruit harvesting, and you have the recipe for a wonderful time.\n\nAs in upstate New York and along the Eastern Seaboard, many New England towns grew up around textile mills or other kinds of factories.  When those industries relocated and\/or shut down during the 1900s, several of those towns fell into a depression, where they remain.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nEnglish is, as with the rest of the US, the de facto official language. Some areas with large Hispanic populations might have a majority speaking Spanish, but most have at least basic English skills (and these are off the tourist path). French is also spoken in Vermont and Northern Maine, near the Quebec\/New Brunswick borders. There is a rich French-Canadian heritage in Biddeford, Maine, and Manchester, New Hampshire's largest city. Though the demographics are changing, it is still possible to find shops that cater to French speakers and churches that conduct Mass in French.  In truth, though, not much is done to accommodate visitors who do not speak English.\n\nAlong with Southerners, New Englanders have a reputation for a distinct flavor of English speech.  This is an overly broad generalization.  The accents of Senators Kennedy and Kerry are rarely heard.  The typical \"pahk the cah in Hahvahd Yahd\" Boston accent prevails in eastern ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Massachusetts"]]},", but is losing ground even there.  There are some distinctive vocabulary words.  \"Bubbler\" refers to a drinking fountain.  Carbonated sweet drinks called \"pop\" in other parts of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United States"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Canada"]]}," are called \"tonic\" or \"soda\" in New England.  \"Wicked\", an adjective interchangeable with \"very\", is frequently used by young New Englanders, though the once-common phrase \"wicked pissah\", meaning \"excellent\", has faded considerably and is used primarily by either the older generation or misled tourists.  A relatively common New England traffic intersection not encountered much elsewhere in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United States"]]}," would be called a \"roundabout\" in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United Kingdom"]]},", but is called a \"rotary\" in New England.  When given directions on how to exit a \"rotary\" the driver would be instructed to \"bang a right\" in Boston.  Large clams are called \"quahaugs\" in southern New England.  In ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Maine"]]}," an inland vacation home is called a \"camp\" while one on the coast is called a \"cottage.\"  Mainers also add the definite article \"the\" to the official names of roads, but not streets or avenues; and the tree that others might call an aspen is called a \"popple\" by Mainers.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\nNew England is served by several airports: ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/massport.com\/logan\/ Logan International"]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boston"]]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/pvdairport.com\/ TF Green Airport"]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Warwick (Rhode Island)"],["Warwick, RI"]]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/bradleyairport.com\/ Bradley International"]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Windsor Locks"]]}," (between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hartford"],["Hartford, CT"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Springfield (Massachusetts)"],["Springfield, MA"]]},"), ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/tweednewhavenairport.com\/ Tweed New Haven"]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Haven"]]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/burlingtonintlairport.com\/ Burlington International"]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Burlington (Vermont)"],["Burlington, VT"]]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/portlandjetport.org Portland"]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/flybangor.com\/ Bangor"]},", and ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/flymanchester.com\/ Manchester"]}," Airport, to name a few.

See the state articles for ski area listings.\n\nNew England skiing is unlike skiing in the western ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United States"]]},".  Instead of open slopes above tree line, New England ski areas have relatively narrow trails carved through thick woodlands.  New England's variable weather continues in winter.  The skier or boarder may experience mild weather with temperatures above 10 Celsius\/50 Fahrenheit or bitter cold with high winds delivering wind chill temperatures of -30 or less.  Rain or snow may fall at any time.  Rain often coats the snow with ice, and snow is often wet and sticky.  The result of these conditions is that skiing and snowboarding in New England require attention to conditions.

Although there are hundreds of miles of hiking trails in the region's state and federal parks, bear in mind that most hiking trails do cross private property, and the owner's rights are to be respected.

",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Haven"]]}," is home to hundreds of bars and restaurants, and has a thriving scene including the Playwright, the largest Irish Pub on the East Coast, a huge space holding two thousand people built out of church parts salvaged from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ireland"]]},".  In addition, several other cities in the region have an active nightlife.  Microbreweries and wineries are also located throughout the region, and many can be visited by travellers.  \n\nBe aware that New England states have strict laws on driving while under the influence of alcohol.  Some New England police departments enforce these laws by stopping traffic near popular bars and interviewing drivers, or by stationing unmarked police cars in or near the parking lots of popular establishments.\n\nTypes of stores that sell alcohol for off-premises consumption vary from state to state.  Generally, wine and beer may be purchased in groceries and convenience stores but harder liquors may only be available from retail liquor stores known locally as \"package stores\" or \"packies\".  While former \"Blue Laws\" prohibited the sale of alcohol on Sundays in Massachusetts and Connecticut, many those laws have since been repealed. However, some cities and towns remain \"dry\" or do not allow for the sale of alcohol. Other New England states have slowly repealed such alcohol sales bans, but be aware of this odd tradition.\n\nNew England is Dunkin Donuts country.  Although it has donuts in the name, this is a coffee chain.  They are easy to find all over New England, especially southern New England where you are probably within a mile of several locations at once.  For those unfamiliar with it Dunkin Donuts (sometimes referred to as \"Dunk's\" or \"Dunkies\") is a fairly barebones experience.  If you want fancier coffee, most towns will have a few locally owned coffee shops as well.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nNew England is one of the safest regions of the country overall, but it is no stranger to crime. All of the region's towns and cities, regardless of their size, have areas that should be travelled with caution at night.  Larger cities are the best-known for crime because of media publicity but most crimes in big cities occur among friends and acquaintances.  Random acts of violence can happen anywhere, even in smaller towns.  It is also best not to hitchhike.  \n\nFurthermore, as with other areas of the country, take care while driving.  You are 200 times more likely to be injured or killed in a car accident than in any random act of violence.  Particular areas to use caution are small, winding roads away from major interstates where cars can travel erratically and at high speeds.  Hikers leaving an automobile at trail heads in remote areas should take care not to leave valuables in the vehicle.\n\nAs in the rest of the USA, 911 can be dialled for emergencies, even from pay-phones.\n\nDangerous animals are hardly a concern in New England.  During May and early June hikers may want to avoid thick woodlands in northern New England or risk being plagued by hordes of tiny black flies.  The best time for hiking is September and October when cold nights have suppressed insect activity.  That said, however, there are many trails with locations exposed to wind and sunshine and minimal contact with biting and stinging insects.  There are rare encounters with poisonous snakes in southern and western parts of New England, but hardly any deaths.  These snakes are so rare that they are considered endangered and it may be against the law to kill them.  The hiker will encounter no poisonous snakes in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Maine"]]}," or northern ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Hampshire"]]},".  The most dangerous animal likely to be encountered by a hiker in New England is the deer tick, a tiny creature no more than about 2 mm in diameter.  Deer ticks carry Lyme Disease, which can engender severe medical symptoms in the victim.  The best defense against the deer tick is to use insecticides and wear long pants and long-sleeved shirts.  Wild turkeys, bears, and coyotes abound in New England but almost always avoid humans.  Moose can be dangerous to motorists speeding along dark roads in northern New England.  These animals are large and their massive bodies will go right through the windshield when struck by a smaller automobile.  The best defense is to drive slowly through moose crossing areas and watch carefully for moose stepping into the road.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nTravellers continuing to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Canada"]]}," may take Interstate 89 North from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Burlington (Vermont)"],["Burlington"]]},", Vermont to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Montreal"]]}," or Maine state highway 9 East from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bangor (Maine)"],["Bangor"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Maine"]]}," to the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Atlantic Provinces"]]}," of Canada.
