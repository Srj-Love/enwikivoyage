The best local place to get a lobster dinner.  It is closed mid-October to late May, but during the summer it is a hot spot!  It provides indoor and outdoor seating, but you'd be crazy to miss the views of the harbor.  Unlike your typical restaurant with wait staff, Shaw's has a counter where you go and order food.  When your order is called, you grab your tray and find a place to sit.

Experience a truly relaxing vacation here.  All of the cottages are either directly on the water or near the water.  The cottages do not have televisions, internet access, or phone access.
