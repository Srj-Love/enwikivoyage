Each pueblo is unique, with their own distinct artistic styles, attractions, and customs.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\"Pueblo\" - the Spanish word for \"town\" or \"village\" - is used in New Mexico to refer to the series of small Native American communities in the state, most of which were established along the Rio Grande. This usage of the word dates back to the first Spanish explorers who passed through the area, who used the term to refer to what were then (and in some cases still are) Native communities housed in apartment-like structures built of adobe and stone, usually arranged around a plaza or perched atop a mesa for defense reasons.\n\nThough often referred to in the collective, each pueblo is unique, with its own set of artistic, cultural and linguistic sensibilities, though they have often had to unite in response to outside forces. The pueblos' historical relationship with the Spanish settlers has varied considerably, from a violent revolt in 1680 in response to the extremely harsh measures the first ",{"type":"''","value":["conquistadors"]}," took in converting the Natives to Catholicism (to this day, the Pueblo Indians have tried to reconcile their Native beliefs with Catholic traditions) to more friendly terms in later years when the Pueblos would unite with their Spanish neighbors to fight other Native tribes in the area, like the Navajo, Apache and Comanche.\n\nThe absorption of New Mexico into the United States in the 1840s brought new difficulties, with many young Natives taken from their communities and placed in boarding schools in the decades that followed. Today, many Pueblo Indians live outside their historic settlements in modern-day housing. But in spite of all this, the Pueblo tribes proudly continue on, practicing the traditions their ancestors did. Some pueblos have taken measures to isolate themselves as a way of protecting their old traditions from an encroaching outside world, while others eagerly welcome visitors so long as they respect the locals' privacy and way of life.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Etiquette"]},"\nMany, but by no means all, of the pueblo communities welcome visitors, usually with some restrictions.

You will also want to refrain from bringing a cell phone onto a pueblo, as tribal officials could confiscate cell phones if they feel they might be used for photography.

Many of the elements of \"New Mexican\" apply to Puebloan cuisine as well, but there are a few dishes which are distinctly Indian:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Oven bread"]}," is very popular among the pueblos. It is baked in a ",{"type":"'''","value":["horno"]},", an outdoor beehive-shaped oven built out of adobe that uses a wood fire as its only heat source. Hornos are common in northern New Mexico and the bread baked in them is light and fluffy."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Frybread"]}," is another common dish, made by frying or deep-frying a flat dough in oil or lard. It is similar to a ",{"type":"''","value":["sopaipilla"]}," (a common New Mexican dish) but different in that sopaipillas are pillowy and filled with air (and thus often stuffed with other ingredients) while frybread is thick and flatter. It can be served as a sweet dish with honey or powdered sugar added on top, or as an ",{"type":"'''","value":["Indian taco"]}," with beans, ground beef, and shredded cheese added on top."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Cornbread"]}," is a traditional staple among the Pueblo people, and cornmeal has always played a significant role in Pueblo life."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Posole"]}," is another staple of Pueblo cuisine. It is soup or stew made from hominy, often with pork, chili, corn, beans, and squash added."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nGiven how remote many of the pueblos are, you won't be able to find a significant amount of nightlife without traveling to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Albuquerque"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Santa Fe (New Mexico)"],["Santa Fe"]]},". However, nearly all of the casinos listed above serve drinks, and several of them bring in name-brand entertainment (primarily the large ones immediately surrounding Albuquerque and Santa Fe).\n\nBeware: small-town bars here are not always good places for the out-of-state visitor to hang out. For one thing, northern New Mexico has significant problems with drunk driving, and the concentration of intoxicated drivers is high close to small-town bars. For another, there have been ethnic tensions intermittently in this part of the state that have led to serious bar fights, some of which have involved visitors. Tread carefully.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nOhkay Owingeh, Pojoaque, Santa Ana, Sandia, Isleta, Laguna, and Acoma Pueblos have hotels on-site, and nearly all of them are attached to their large casinos. However, accommodations at these hotels, which are usually full-on resorts with golf courses and such, are usually not cheap. A larger selection of accommodations can be found in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Taos"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Santa Fe (New Mexico)"],["Santa Fe"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Albuquerque"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gallup"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\nSome of these pueblos are quite remote. While you should do okay maintaining a cell phone signal in these parts (a lot of cell towers have been built in New Mexico recently) don't be surprised if you do lose it. Wi-fi is almost non-existent in the pueblos (except perhaps at some hotels), so it's not even worth the trouble to try.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nThe pueblos are just one of the many things to experience in New Mexico. However, if you're hankering for more Indian culture, head out to the Navajo or Apache reservations in the state.
