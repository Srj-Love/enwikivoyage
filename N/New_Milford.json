Much of the downtown area still has authentic looking building fronts from the early 1900’s which adds a nice touch of history in your experiences you have during your visit.\n\nThe town center consists of small shops and boutiques that are all very affordable.  There are also a large variety of restaurants including Mexican, American, and Italian.  The town green is a nice place to walk around and enjoy the outdoors especially in the summertime.

Bars in this area have a relaxed feel to them and are very affordable as well.  Being situated in the center of Candlewood Valley, the rolling hills that surround the town are very pleasant to look at during any season of the year. Multiple parks in the area provide a place where you can enjoy views of the area as well as places to hike or have a picnic.  \n\nThe prosperity of this town relies a lot upon its locally owned businesses and restaurants so it is a nice place to get away from chain businesses.
