Nicknamed the Big Easy, New Orleans has long had a reputation as an adult oriented city. However, the city also offers many attractions for families with children and those interested in culture and the arts. It is a city with a majority Roman Catholic population owing to its European origins.\n\nFamous festivals like Mardi Gras and Jazz Fest bring in tourists by the millions, and are the two times of the year when one needs to be sure to book well in advance to be sure of a room. The city also hosts numerous smaller festivals and gatherings like the French Quarter Festival, Creole Tomato Festival, Satchmo SummerFest, the Essence Festival hosted by the magazine, Halloween parading and costume balls, Saint Patrick's Day and Saint Joseph's Day parading, Southern Decadence, and so many more. The city takes almost any occasion for an excuse for a parade, a party, and live music, and in New Orleans most events often have a touch of Mardi Gras year round. Like they say, New Orleanians are either planning a party, enjoying one or recovering from one. Party down!\n\nIt is a city of great culture with a clash of French, Cajun and some Spanish designs. You may see some voodoo activity at night.  The trolley rides are fun and many of the stores carry exclusive cultural art such as the blue dog collection.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Jackson Square.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Jackson Square is the historic heart of the French Quarter"]]},"\n\nIn the late 1600s, French trappers and traders began settling in what is now New Orleans, along a Native American trade route between the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain via Bayou St. John. In 1718 the city was officially founded as \"Nouvelle-Orléans\" by Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, Governor of the French colony of Louisiana, with the intent to build it into a provincial capital city. The early French city grew within the grid of what is now the French Quarter. Louisiana was transferred to Spanish rule in the 1760s, but much of the population retained French language and culture.  After briefly returning to French rule, Louisiana was purchased by the United States in 1803.  At first the new \"American\" settlers mostly built their homes and shops upriver from the older French parts of the city, across wide \"Canal Street\" (named for a planned canal that was never built).  Canal Street was the dividing line between the Anglophone and Francophone sections; the street's wide median became a popular meeting place called \"the neutral ground\"—and \"neutral ground\" became the common phrase for the median of any street, still in use in the New Orleans dialect today.\n\nA British attempt to seize the city in 1815 was repelled downriver from the city in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chalmette"]]}," by local forces led by Andrew Jackson, whose equestrian statue can be seen in the square named after him in the center of the old Quarter.\n\nEarly New Orleans was already a rich melting pot of peoples and cultures. French Spanish African and Anglos were joined by immigrants from Ireland, Germany, and the Caribbean. While a center of the slave trade before the American Civil War, New Orleans also had the USA's largest population of free people of color.  The city grew rapidly as a major trade center on the mighty Mississippi River.  In the American Civil War of the 1860s, New Orleans fell to the Union early in the conflict without battle within the city, sparing the city's rich historic architecture from the destruction suffered by much of the American South. \n\nAt the start of the 20th century, the then largely neglected old French Quarter started gaining new appreciation among artists and bohemians for its architecture and ambiance. Around the same time, a new musical style developed in the city; the music developed and swept around the world under the name of \"jazz\". \n\nAlthough far from the big battlefronts, New Orleans is proud of its contributions to the Allied victory over Fascism in World War II, especially the development and construction of landing craft such as \"Higgins Boats\" which made rapid landing masses of troops on hostile beaches possible. This legacy is why America's National World War II Museum is located in the city.   \n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath"]},"\nIn August 2005 New Orleans and the surrounding area was hit by Hurricane Katrina. Much worse than the hurricane was the failure of the federally designed levee system; in what has been called \"the worst civil engineering disaster in U.S. history\" when some 80% of the city flooded. \n\nNew Orleans was not destroyed, but the flood was a severe blow, perhaps the worst disaster to hit a U.S. city since the great ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Francisco"]]}," earthquake 99 years previous.  Six years later, many visitors might notice little or no sign that anything bad happened.  For locals, however, rebuilding is still an ongoing process.  The French Quarter and other oldest parts of town most popular with visitors were built on comparative high ground, and were less damaged and have been more quickly restored.  However, not everything is back to normal in the city; scenes of devastation can be still seen in many neighborhoods. More than two-thirds of the city's pre-Katrina population is back living in the city; most of them have a fierce love of their city and have faced many hardships in their continuing efforts to rebuild it bit by bit.\n\nThe city's public services - especially police - have struggled to return to their full strength, and are dealing with a city where decades of neighborhood stability have been disrupted.  The city overall has experienced an increase in crime as a result.  (See \"Stay safe\" below.)\n\nWhile some visitors decide to confine their trip to the more fully intact parts of the city or just visit the worse hit areas as part of a half-day \"disaster tour\", for others the historic events of Katrina and its aftermath are the focus of their visit.\n\nVolunteer projects such as ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.habitat-nola.org\/ New Orleans Area Habitat for Humanity"]}," which builds new houses has attracted volunteers doing good work.  Organizations such as ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/levees.org Levees.org"]}," are vigilant in encouraging further investigation into the flooding and hurricane protection issues surrounding New Orleans, and visitors to the city are encouraged to tour ravaged areas and help keep alive the attention needed to restore New Orleans to its original grandeur.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Imperial"],["janhigh = 62"],["febhigh = 65"],["marhigh = 71"],["aprhigh = 78"],["mayhigh = 85"],["junhigh = 89"],["julhigh = 91"],["aughigh = 90"],["sephigh = 87"],["octhigh = 80"],["novhigh = 71"],["dechigh = 65"],["janlow = 43"],["feblow = 46"],["marlow = 52"],["aprlow = 58"],["maylow = 66"],["junlow = 71"],["jullow = 73"],["auglow = 73"],["seplow = 70"],["octlow = 60"],["novlow = 50"],["declow = 45"],["janprecip = 5.1"],["febprecip = 5.5"],["marprecip = 5.3"],["aprprecip = 4.8"],["mayprecip = 4.9"],["junprecip = 5.6"],["julprecip = 6.6"],["augprecip = 5.9"],["sepprecip = 5.4"],["octprecip = 2.8"],["novprecip = 4.5"],["decprecip = 5.3"],["description = ",{"type":"{{","value":[["ForecastNOAA"],["New Orleans"],["29.95374"],["-90.07776"]]}]]},"\n\nA local joke has it that New Orleans really does have four seasons: Summer, Hurricane, Christmas, and Mardi Gras.  Summer is certainly the longest; for about half the year, from about late April to the start of October, the days are usually hot, or raining, or hot and raining.  Winters are generally short and mild, but subject to occasional cold snaps that may surprise visitors who mistakenly think the city has a year round tropical climate.  The high humidity can make the cold snaps feel quite penetrating. Snow is so rare that the occasional light dusting of flakes will make most locals stop what they are doing to stare; they'll excitedly show the phenomenon to local children too young to remember the last time snow visited the city.  If you happen to be visiting town during a rare freezing event, be forewarned that most locals have no idea how to drive on iced or snowy roads. \n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season (which includes all of the Gulf of Mexico) is June 1 through November 30. The most active month is September.\n\nSome say the best time to visit New Orleans is between late November and early June.  However New Orleans has things going on all year long.  A rewarding visit can be made even the hottest part of the summer: Start your day early, and do your outdoor sightseeing in the morning.  The lush local flora can display a wealth of colorful flowers. Mid-day and afternoon, retreat to air-conditioning; visit a museum, have a leisurely visit to a cafe or restaurant, or take a siesta at your hotel.  Come back outside when the sun gets low. After dark the night shift of flora comes on duty; especially in older neighborhoods such as Esplanade Ridge, Carrollton, the Garden District, etc. with an abundance of night-blooming jasmine, the sweet deliciously scented air can be almost intoxicating.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Creoles, Cajuns, and New Orleanians"]},"\n\nDespite what many visitors expect, the population, food, music, and traditions of New Orleans are not predominately Cajun. The Acadian or Cajun (from 'Cadien, pronounced kay-juhn) people developed their rich culture to the west of the city, in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Acadiana"]]}," section of Louisiana. While there are some good places for Cajun food and music in the city—some are branches of famous Southwest Louisiana Cajun places that opened up locations here—understand that Cajun food and culture are a recent import that has no roots in New Orleans. Unfortunately a number of businesses in the most tourist heavy parts of town decided to profit by selling visitors what they thought they wanted, slapping the term \"Cajun\" on dishes and products with little to do with Acadiana.\n\nThe oldest aspects of New Orleans culture are ",{"type":"'''","value":["Creole"]},"—which here designates the people that were already here before the city became part of the United States with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803.  French, Spanish, and African are the primary ethnic and cultural groups in old Creole culture, with additional input from Native Americans and early German immigrants (who became much more numerous later in the 19th century).  \n\nSince the Louisiana Purchase, other major immigrant groups and influences on local cuisine and culture have included Italian (mostly Southern and Sicilian), Irish, German, Caribbean and Central American. Hondurans are traditionally the largest Hispanic group in the metro area, but after Katrina, there is now an influx of Latinos, mostly hailing from Central America and Mexico who have decided to stay after helping in the construction boom in the aftermath of Katrina. Smaller populations of Cubans, Dominicans, and Puerto Ricans are also sparsely located throughout the area. In the late 20th century a sizable Vietnamese community was added to the New Orleans gumbo. They can be found in greatest concentrations in New Orleans East and portions of the Westbank suburbs (Marrero, Harvey, & Gretna).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By plane "]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.flymsy.com Louis Armstrong International Airport"]}]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["MSY"]]},") is the city's primary airport, located in the suburb of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kenner"]]},". After a severe dip after the disaster in 2005, by late 2006 the airport has rebounded to 3\/4 of its pre-Katrina flights with daily flights to\/from 37 destinations throughout North America. Additional flights have continued to be added in more recent years. European vacation packages are available from the UK on several British airlines who offer charter\/cruise services nonstop to the Crescent City.\n\nTo get into town a taxi ($33 for one or two people, $14 per person for three or more) is quickest; that's the flat fee from the airport to any spot in the French Quarter or Central Business District. Limo service is also available for rates starting at $35, and the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.airportshuttleneworleans.com\/ airport shuttle"]}," is $20.

On weekdays, the bus runs straight down Airline Highway (US 61) to Tulane and Loyola Ave. in the New Orleans Central Business District; the trip takes 45 minutes.  (From this intersection, simply walk toward the river, deeper into the central business district, and take a left, crossing Canal Street and into the French Quarter.  From Canal Street one can also take the streetcar Uptown or into Midcity.  \n\nThe Airport bus stop is on the second level of the airport, outside door #7 near the Delta counter on the west end of the terminal, in the median (look for the sign and bench); the stop is a fair walk from the east end baggage pickup, and you'll probably have to ask at an information desk to find it.\n\nMany major hotels have shuttle buses from the airport. Even if you're not staying at one of those hotels, the shuttles can often be a value for those getting in to town if their destination is near one of the hotels.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By car "]},"\nThe main artery into and out of town is Interstate 10, going to the east and west.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By bus or train "]},"\nBus and train stations are next to each other at the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Union Passenger Terminal"]}," (1001 Loyola Avenue), by the edge of the Central Business District and within walking distance of the Super Dome.

Walking is fun and healthy during daylight and early evening. After  midnight, you may want to call a taxi, but likely it will be a short trip at reasonable cost. For a great way to see the city, try renting a bike from one of the several bike rental companies in the French Quarter or Marigny.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" With a car "]},"\nBe alert that the streets of much of the city were laid out before the automobile, especially in the older parts of town of most interest to visitors.

In the French Quarter, bicycle rentals are available at a bike shop on Dauphine Street near the hotels of Canal St as well as at an antique shop on Decatur Street near the French Market. Other places with bike rentals include a bicycle shop in the Marigny Triangle neighborhood on Frenchmen Street and another Uptown on Magazine Street.\n\nThe Riverfront, Canal Street and St. Charles streetcars travel to or near many of the sites listed here. Fares for buses or streetcars are $1.25, 25¢ extra for a transfer (good only on another line but not a return trip on the same line). Express buses are $1.50. Day passes are available for $3.

From the local perspective, the entire route goes one way: up (or on the return trip from Carrollton to the Quarter, down).\n\nKnow that Canal Street is the ",{"type":"''","value":["up river"]}," boundary of the French Quarter. (Keep going further \"up\" away from the Quarter and you'll be in \"Uptown\".) \n\nSome streets are labeled \"North\" and \"South\", this reflects which side of Canal Street they are on (despite the fact that Canal Street runs from southeast to northwest). The part of Rampart Street on the French Quarter side is North Rampart Street; the part on the Central Business District side is South Rampart.  Also, a good map of the entire city is a must, as people from out of town may have to learn to simply match letters on signs to letters on the map.  You see, most street names are French and Creole in origin and may be hard to pronounce.  For instance, try to pronounce these example street names : Urquhart, Rocheblave, Dorgenois, Terpsichore, Tchoupitoulas, Burthe, Freret.  (For the record, locals say \"Urk-heart, Roach-a-blave, Der-gen-wa, Terp-sic-cor, Chop-a-two-lis, B'youth, Fa-ret.\") Now you understand.\n\nMany major New Orleans streets are divided, with a \"neutral ground\" (median) running down the middle.  For this reason, the traffic lights have no dedicated cycle for a protected left turn.  On streets with a wide neutral ground, there is a solution.  Imagine turning from an avenue to a street; the solution is to turn left on green, queue in the stretch of the street between the two halves of the avenue, then proceed once the traffic light on the street has turned green.  On streets with a narrow neutral ground, there is not enough room for cars to queue.  In these situations, left turns are often prohibited; the solution is to go straight, take the next U-turn, then take a right turn when you arrive back at the intersection.  Streets such as Tulane Avenue famously have \"No Left Turn\" signs posted for miles. In these situations, the adage \"three rights make a left\" comes in handy.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Island of Salvation Botanical mural.JPG"],["thumb"],["210px"],["Voodoo in the Bywater"]]},"\nDetailed listings of attractions are mentioned in the Districts sections listed above.

The Creoles were the peoples originally in New Orleans from its founding. Creole has a mixture of influences, including French and Spanish, with a strong West-African foundation.  Creoles cook with roux (a blend of butter and flour) and the \"trinity,\" a popular term for green pepper, onion and celery. These are the base for many savory dishes.  19th-century southern Italian immigrants added increased appreciation for garlic — an old local joke calls garlic the \"Pope\" to the culinary \"Trinity\" — along with tomato based sauces and other dishes. (The influences went both ways; some New Orleans \"Italian\" restaurants have their own take on the Italian tradition, sometimes called \"Creole Italian\".) Eastern European, Latin American, Vietnamese, and other immigrants have added to the New Orleans mix. Thus New Orleans cuisine is rich in tradition while open to new ideas, and culturally inclusive while still uniquely distinctive.\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["seafood"]}," is fresh and relatively cheap compared to many places.

Either way, it's good, but only part of what makes the sandwich tasty. The rest is what is put on it, of course. Roast beef with \"debris\" gravy, fried shrimp, oysters, etc...  You'll probably be asked if you want it \"dressed\".  In New Orleans, \"dressed\" means with lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, and sometimes pickles, depending on the restaurant.  Every neighborhood in New Orleans has its favorite po-boy places; the better ones butcher, slow cook, and season their own meats. The po-boy is a great and filling taste of New Orleans at a reasonable price.\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Muffaletta"]}," is a sandwich served on a big round airy Italian loaf (also called a muffaletta) which is similar to focaccia, it consists of a variety of sliced meats such as capicola, salami, and mortadella as well as cheeses topped with olive salad.

Seafood is the most common meat; but one will just as often find chicken, duck, smoked sausage or \"andouille\" sausage, the ages-old \"gombo d'zherbes\" (vegetarian) and other types of gumbo on many a menu.

The flavors need not be overly sweet, and can come in a wide variety ranging from striking to subtle, including such treats as wild cherry, lemonade, chocolate cream, coffee, orchid vanilla, and dozens of others.  Locals almost worship the better neighborhood sno-ball stands during the city's long hot summer; try the refreshing treat as a snack or dessert and find out why.

Coffee in New Orleans differs from any other coffee in the world.  During the Civil War, coffee beans were very scarce.  The local French extended their coffee supply by adding ground roasted chicory (the root of endive lettuce) to the brew.  New Orleanians became very accustomed to the new beverage, noting that the chicory softened the bitter edge of the coffee while enhancing the robust flavor.  Many taste a slight chocolate flavor while drinking café au lait, due to the addition of chicory.\n\nMany restaurants will have ",{"type":"'''","value":["hot sauce"]}," as a condiment on the table (even Chinese and fast-food restaurants).

New Orleans also has no \"blue laws\" or mandatory closing times for liquor establishments, which means that any hour of day or night, every day of the year, there is always somewhere to get alcohol.\n\nYou can head out the door with an open container of alcohol—but not in a bottle or can; to try to keep broken glass and jagged metal from filling the street, local laws mandate you use a plastic cup while on city streets and sidewalks. These are known locally as \"go cups\", and every local bar provides them, usually has a stack of them by the door and the bouncer will take your drink from you and pour it into the cup because bars can be held liable if they don't.

Hotels on or near the St. Charles Avenue streetcar line in Uptown are popular with many visitors, and the smaller hotels and guest houses in neighborhoods like Marigny and Mid-City can provide an immersion in New Orleans away from the larger masses of tourists. Individual hotels are listed in the parts of town sub-articles.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Hurricanes"]},"\nKatrina alerted the world to the danger of hurricanes in this part of the world. However if one visits a place vulnerable to natural disaster, at least hurricanes give warning. During the height of the hurricane season, from July through October, be sure to check with the weather service before going to New Orleans, and if a large storm is threatening the Gulf Coast, consider a change of plans. If one threatens the city while you're there, play it safe and leave early; don't wait for an evacuation order to head away from the coast.  If you cannot get out of the area you should at least be sure to get to a hotel located on high ground (as a rule in New Orleans, the older the neighborhood, the higher the ground).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Health"]},"\nWorries about health risks in New Orleans remaining after the post-Katrina cleanup were fortunately unfounded. The main health concerns are the same for the rest of the U.S. South: If you're not accustomed to the sub-tropical heat, drink plenty of liquids and pace yourself in the sunshine.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Crime"]},"\n\nThe majority of the city's notorious crime problem is manifested away from the parts of town of interest to most visitors, but always be aware of your surroundings. The ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Orleans\/Central City"],["Central City"]]}," neighborhood is having the worst problem, and at present should be avoided by casual visitors. The \"Back of town\" sections of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Orleans\/7th, 8th, and Upper 9th Wards"],["7th 8th and 9th Wards"]]}," have also been having serious problems. Visitors are advised to check on current local conditions before visiting these neighborhoods and take extra care if they go.\n\nStay out of St. Louis cemetery unless you are with a tour group. Ditto Armstrong Park, unless you're there for an event like Jazz in the Park. Avoid the Iberville project on the other side of N Rampart St, west of Armstrong Park. \n\nWhile the French Quarter and attractions most visited by tourists are some of the safest areas for violent crimes, beware opportunistic thieves looking for a chance to snatch something from visitors who are not keeping an eye on their valuables. A famous 19th century sign from the Quarter reads: \"Beware Pickpockets and Loose Women.\" Not much has changed. Tourists can be so drunk and distracted that they are separated from their common sense and, all too often, other things. Keep things in your front pockets, and be careful with your digital on Bourbon. Locals have an expression, \"Nothing good happens in the Quarter after midnight\". Bar bouncers are allowed to kill and injure people with impunity, so don't tangle with them.\n\nAround parts of the French Quarter and nearby areas with many tourists, visitors can encounter hustlers who will try to get a few dollars from tourists offering anything from a flower to a hat, a foot massage, or even to clean your shoes. Another popular tourist scam is to bet a tourist $20 that the scammer knows where the tourist got their shoes.  If the tourist takes the bet, the scammer responds, \"You got them on your feet\" and demands the $20.  Remember that you are under no obligation to talk to people and it's just best to ignore them. This is especially true of the hordes of gutter punks in the lower Quarter, near the old U.S. Mint and where Frenchman intersects with Esplanade, near the fire station.\n\nAll in all, though, the government and police are aware of the problem and are there to help you, but you can help them (and yourself) also by using one simple rule: ",{"type":"'''","value":["use your common sense"]}," (as one would do in any other sizeable city). Being alone and utterly drunk is not the best state to be in when walking through a deserted alley in downtown New Orleans on a regular busy Saturday night, and during massive crowd-drawers like Mardi Gras or Southern Decadence, one should be more careful than on an average Wednesday afternoon.\n\nLast but not least: looking for drugs or illegal activities will not only expose you to danger; if someone you just met is trying to lure you into a strange part of town for something decadent, assume you're probably being set up for a robbery or worse. Also be advised that Louisiana has the harshest sentencing laws in the country as most felonies carry a mandatory prison sentence, so conduct yourself accordingly.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\nThe telephone area code for New Orleans and the nearer suburbs is ",{"type":"'''","value":["504"]},".\n\nThere are cyber-cafes throughout the city, with the greatest number in the French Quarter and CBD.
