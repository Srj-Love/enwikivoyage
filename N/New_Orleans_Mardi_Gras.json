The yearly festival includes numerous events throughout the city, and is known as ",{"type":"'''","value":["the biggest free party on earth"]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Understand "]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:BandStPh.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Costumed musicians in the French Quarter, Mardi Gras"]]},"\n\nThe festival is rooted in the ancient ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Europe"]]},"an Carnival traditions. It marks the final celebrations before the period of fasting during Lent in the Roman Catholic Religion, although New Orleans Carnival is enjoyed by people of any belief.\n\nFor locals, \"Mardi Gras\" strictly speaking is only the last and biggest day of the Carnival season, \"Fat Tuesday\". Visitors less clear on this distinction sometimes call the whole New Orleans Carnival season \"Mardi Gras\". The final big day is thus sometimes called by the (technically redundant) name \"Mardi Gras Day\".\n\nAfter spotty earlier festivities, parades roll most nights starting 2 weekends before Mardi Gras. Things kick into high gear the weekend before Mardi Gras, when the population of New Orleans more than doubles (book a room well in advance!). There's an all day party along the riverfront downtown on Lundi Gras (\"Fat Monday\", the day before Mardi Gras) followed by more parades that evening, and just when you think things couldn't get more wild, the climax of Mardi Gras takes Carnival to an entirely new level.\n\nWearing a mask or costume on Mardi Gras Day is highly recommended by Mardi Gras veterans; one becomes part of the party, rather than just watching it. Veterans also start the party on Mardi Gras morning, even if you aren't usually a morning person. Mardi Gras officially ends promptly at midnight Tuesday.\n\nThe next day is Ash Wednesday (nicknamed locally \"Trash Wednesday\" from the debris left in the streets from the parties), the start of Lent. Wearing Mardi Gras beads during Lent will mark you as a tourist; time to take them off.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Mardi Gras date "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" 17 February 2015"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Parades "]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Rex 2012 Butterfly King 3.JPG"],["right"],["thumb"],["300px"],["The Rex parade is one of Mardi Gras' most famous and beautiful"]]},"\nMardi Gras parades are a big attraction. Many locals have their favorites and by not following the crowds, you can often get a better perspective on the Big Easy.\n\nThe parades are put on by private organizations known as \"krewe\"s; they do not receive any government or corporate sponsorship.\n\nWatching a parade in New Orleans is a participatory party; crowds dance to the music of the bands and clamour for \"throws\". Throws are the trinkets thrown from krewe members on the floats to the crowd, including plastic beads and cups (often decorated with the emblem of the krewe), \"dubloons\" - small aluminum discs like a souvenir coin, and various toys and gee-gaws.\n\nPick up the Mardi Gras Guide magazine, or consult the newspapers for parade schedules and routes. Note that many of the smaller parades, marching krewes, neighborhood pageants, Mardi Gras Indians, etc are usually not listed in these schedules.\n\nThe majority of the parades follow a standard route, starting ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Orleans\/Uptown"],["Uptown"]]}," at Napoleon Avenue and going down St. Charles Avenue to the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Orleans\/Central Business District"],["Central Business District"]]}," then on to Canal Street at the upper border of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Orleans\/French Quarter"],["French Quarter"]]},". \n\nThere are sizable parades two weekends before Mardi Gras, then every night starting the Wednesday before Mardi Gras.
