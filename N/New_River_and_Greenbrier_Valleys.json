As of March 2007, the Hatfield-McCoy Trail System totals several hundred miles of off-road trails in five of its nine project counties. Each of its six trail systems are open to ATV's, Dirt Bikes, select Utility Vehicles (UTVs), Mountain Bikes, Horses, and Hikers. Many of the trail systems also offer community connecting trails that allow visitors to access “ATV friendly towns” to experience the charm of southern West Virginia. \n\nThe six Hatfield-McCoy trail systems are Browning Fork, Buffalo Mountain, Dingess Rum, New Indian Ridge, Little Coal, and Pinnacle Creek Trails. No matter which trail system you choose, Hatfield-McCoy Trail visitors can expect to find a variety of trails ranging from easiest to most difficult. These are not your typical “flatlander” trails however and can be a challenge for a first time rider. For this reason, visitors may choose from a list of ATV guided tour and rental providers. You can find a listing of these providers and a complete list of lodging facilities by visiting our accommodations page of this web site. \n\nThe overall goal of the Hatfield-McCoy Trails project is to develop a world class trail system with an emphasis on safety in each of its nine project counties throughout southern West Virginia. Project estimates have concluded that once the trails are developed and linked through each of the project counties, there may be as much as 2000 miles of total trails. Long term plans for the Hatfield-McCoy Trails also include a 4x4 park in Kanawha County and designated trail areas for equestrian and other non-motorized users. \n\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Hatfield-McCoy Trails"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.trailsheaven.com"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone ="],["tollfree=+1-800-592-2217"],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content= Open daily, sunrise to sunset.
