Home  to only about 5,000 people, the town offers great opportunities to tourists while preserving the small town feel that is missing from places like New Orleans.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nNew Roads is the second oldest settlement in the state of Louisiana, after ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Orleans"]]},".  It was built alongside what was once the Mississippi River.  But since the city was first settled, the river has changed its course and left behind an oxbow lake. Oxbow lakes are know for their semi-circular or crescent shapes, and they occur when one curve in the river is cut off from the main channel and becomes sealed of from it, creating a lake.  Over the years, New Roads has become one of the most visited small towns in the state, and several tourists return after their first trip.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Plane"]},"\n\nThe airport closest to New Roads is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Baton Rouge"]]}," Metropolitan Airport, located about 35 miles southeast.  New Orleans International is about 125 miles Southeast.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Car"]},"\n\nNew Roads is somewhat remote and does not lie along any interstate. But from Downtown Baton Rouge take I-10 westbound crossing the Mississippi River via the Horace Wilkinson Bridge.  Exit at LA HWY 415 which will merge into US HWY 190.  Turn onto the LA HWY 1 . This stretch of road comes to an end but LA 1 continues left.  Take left and arrive in New Roads.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Bus"]},"\n\nBus service from Baton Rouge does not travel to New Roads, as most of the town's tourists are from within the state and drive there.  But rental cars are available at Baton Rouge Metro and New Orleans Intl.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nNew Roads and the surrounding countryside are relatively easy to navigate for an attentive motorist, but beware, the oxbow shape of the Lake can get you turned around when traveling on LA 1.  Within the city proper, the main arterial streets are Main Street (LA 10), New Roads Street (LA 10), Parent Street-Morganza Hwy (LA 1).  New Roads offers ample parking space along Main Street and Morrison Parkway.  There is also a lot behind the courthouse on Main Street (accessible via Alamo and Court Streets) and large lot behind the post office (accessible via Main Street)\nBe advised, rush hour traffic on Main Street can be highly annoying, so try to travel during the middle of the day during the week and early or late on weekends.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Pointe Coupee Parish Courthouse"]},", E.
