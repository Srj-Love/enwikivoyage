Most of that population is concentrated in Sydney, which has 4.2 million of the state's 6.7 million inhabitants. The next largest cities are (in order) Newcastle and Wollongong. After that the larger cities and towns in the state are merely moderately-sized regional centres of 40,000-50,000 people. Many of the cultural sights are concentrated in Sydney and nearby. However, this isn't true of historical or natural sights. Many of the state's most beautiful natural sights, obviously enough, lie well outside the Sydney metropolitan area. Australian history and identity is to some extent tied up with rural settlement and lifestyle, and thus you will find many of the outlying regions of New South Wales base their tourism industry around pioneer and rural history.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Climate "]},"\n\nNew South Wales' climate varies considerably depending on the area in the state. \n\nIn winter the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Snowy Mountains"]]}," can receive significant snowfalls, with an extensive ski fields operating between July and September.  During cold snaps in mid-winter snow can fall down to 800 metres in inland New South Wales, giving a light snow cover to large areas of the state.  The desert areas of inland New South Wales struggle to reach 15ºC, and southern coastal areas including Sydney range between 9-17ºC in July, the coldest month.  However the north coast of New South Wales, towards ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tweed Heads"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Byron Bay"]]},", averages above 20ºC even during mid-winter.  Winter generally isn't the time for beach swimming in New South Wales, with the season generally being between October and March - maybe a little earlier up north, and maybe a little later down south.\n\nIn summer most head for coastal regions, with New South Wales having literally hundreds of clean patrolled beaches and coastal towns.  The inland towns can be hot, with many averaging over 30ºC in summer, often peaking above 40ºC.  After Christmas until the end of January can be difficult to find any available accommodation near the coast at short notice.\n\nThe best time to visit New South Wales depends on your interest.  Most activities, transport, restaurants and other facilities operate year-round.  For the beach holiday summer December to February is perfect.  It can be hot, but if you are the beach, that is the way you want it.  The best months for reliable snowfalls are August to September, although you are always at the whim of Mother Nature on the ski fields.  Spring and Autumn are good for walking, and for country driving holiday.\n\nIf you are exploring Sydney and the cities, avoiding the summer period will reduce the crowds and peak accommodation costs.
