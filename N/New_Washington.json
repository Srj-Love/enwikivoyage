You can take a ship from one of the piers at the Manila North harbor to the port of Dumaguit. In the late 60's and early 70's this is the mode of transportation of foreign and local tourists who flock to Kalibo at the height of the popularity of the Ati-atihan festival. The rich and famous of Ilo-ilo and Negros used to charter ships and anchored them at Dumaguit when attending the Ati-atihan festival, a sort of floating hotel. \n\nBy ship is also the mode of transportation for backpackers who want to immerse in local culture on their way to the world famous Boracay. They take a leisurely trip from the east (Dumaguit)to the west(Caticlan).This is until there is a direct route by ship to Boracay via Caticlan.\n\nThere used to be a port in the town of New Washington, until the Lagantik river become heavily silted that render it inaccessible. The Lagantik river route is now mainly used by barges and ship of small tonnage carrying cargo. The town is situated in the narrow strip of land approximately 300 meters long from the old municipal building to the north and the port of New Washington to the south. From the sea side you can see the river. The port is at the Lagantik river that runs westward from Dumaguit to the town proper and beyond. New Washington has been the gateway to Kalibo the capital of Aklan and other towns and to Manila because of the presence of the port. Before the construction of the Kalibo-Banga-Balete-Altavas road, buses from the province of Capiz and Ilo-ilo took the Altavas-Batan route, then by barge to Dumaguit and continue the trip to Kalibo.\n\nYou can also go by air using the Kalibo International Airport. New Washington is only 9 kilometers away along well paved road. Transportation is not a problem.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThere are several resort to see in New Washington. One is the Maria Mercedes and Frogs Hollow resorts both located at sitio Malogo a kilometer away from the town proper. Sampaguita Garden Resort and Convention is at Rizal street just across the Aklan State University, College of Fisheries and Marine Sciences, New Washington campus.\n\nTo the west going to Kalibo is the Bay Park at barangay Tambak. There is a band playing every Saturday night. Adjacent to the Park is a place for family picnic, swimming and fishing. It is a good place to unwind during weekends.\n\nIn sitio Contang at barangay Ochando is the site of Pacto de Sangre (Blood Compact) on March 3, 1897.The Blood Compact is a radical way of expressing their loyalty to the aims of the revolution against Spain by signing their name in blood.\n\nAcross the Lagatik river to the south, 20 minutes boat ride from the town proper is the Isla Kapispisan Mangrove Reforestation Aquasilviculture and Eco-tourism Project. It won First Place in the Regional Development Council (RDC) and National Development Authority (NEDA) Search for Best Public Sector Project Award in Region 6.

The project hope to reforest the wetlands and bring back marine resources in the area. It is one big step to help the environment and have a positive impact on climate change.Here you will see mangrove trees just starting to grow and others in different stages of development.\n\nIn the town plaza you will see the statue of the late Jaime Cardinal Sin previous Archbishop of Manila facing the Holy Rosary church.

Peralta==Eat==\nNew Washington has a lot of offerings when it comes to food. You can order the regular yummy crabs and prawns. You may also have the sea shell locally called \"hale-hale\" known for its aphrodisiac  power. For the adventurous (shade of Fear Factor) you may want to experience eating a local delicacy called \"tamiluk\". It is a wood worm that feed on dead mangrove trees. There is also another worm locally called \"sasing\" a marine worm dug from the inter tidal zone of the Lagatik river. It is eaten raw. These worms are not for the squeamish and the faint hearted. In a sense they are exotic and for other people are taboo. It is mentioned here for their uniqueness and has been part of local food culture.\n\nOf course we have the regular glutinous rice (malagkit) cooked in coconut milk and wrapped in coconut fronds. Locally it is called \"ibos\". We can also find these in other part of the country, other giving it a twist of their own usually in the way it is wrapped. We have also another snack locally called \"suman\". The flour is made from a native palm called \"ambolong\". The flour is locally called \"okao\". The flour is mixed with grated young coconut and sugar. It is the oil from the coconut that act as the catalyst in cooking. It take special skill to wrapped these in banana leaves. The secret is to heat the leaves just enough (eahob) since banana leaves tear easily without the heat treatment. It has a tacky texture. These are great for snacks. It is similar to the Ilocos \"tupig\" young coconut mixed in glutinous rice but in this case broiled.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nThere is a drink popular in the Visayas (Philippines) called \"tuba\". This drink is exotic, a form of coconut wine. Fresh \"tuba\" has wine like smell but milder (compared to red wine from fermented grapes) and taste like one but sweeter. Although sweetness and sourness I would say depend on the age of the coconut tree and other factors. There is however a belief that the taste of \"tuba\" depend on the \"tuba\" gatherer's skill (manang-gite) raising it to an art.\n\n\"Tuba\" is derived from the sap drawn from the peduncle of the coconut tree using a very sharp scythe. The peduncle is slice thin {1 to 2 mm., thick and 2 to 3 slices) across the length to expose fresh peduncle everyday until it is used up. The slicing is done everyday since the peduncle dies up at the end. Slicing also increases the production of sap.As much as a liter of sap can be drawn from each peduncle in a twenty four hour period, but this may depend again on the age of the coconut tree.\n\nLocal folks drink it as a beverage which can make you red in the face, tipsy and mildly inebriated.The effect is comparable to drinking beer but may vary from person to person. The alcohol content is of interest to pursue. \"Tuba\" do not keep long. This is because it readily ferments to vinegar. One to two days old \"tuba\" is sour to the taste. \"Tuba\" is enjoyed fresh from the coconut tree, just like freshly baked bread from the oven.\n\nThere was this American expatriate (a Richardson) who love \"tuba\" so much he has steady supply everyday. \"Tuba\"is a drinking experience.\n\nAnother way of enjoying \"tuba\" is by putting one raw chicken egg in one glass of \"tuba\", stir well and drink. It makes a potent brew.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nThere are several places you can choose from, during your stay in New Washington. It depends on what you want to experience and inclination. For a rustic setting 'far from the maddening crowd' there is Maria Mercedes resort. It is located at Malogo about two kilometers away from the town proper. It is named after the mother and mother in law of the owner. Here, you will get pampered in a way, only a loving mother can. If you love the night life, the Rainbows Inn is the place for you. You will not miss it on your way from the Kalibo International Airport to New Washigton (on the right) because of its eye catching facade. It is very close to the Bay Park at Barangay Tambak. The Bay Park is the place where you can see the beautiful sunrise, and they say it is also where the sun set because of the video bars and the pubs as night falls. If you are lucky you will see and hear a live band playing. In the morning you can take a swim on the beach for free to wash the hangover away. New Washington is also known for the Sampaguita Garden Resort and Convention Center, at Rizal street in the poblacion. It is just across the Aklan State University School of Fisheries and Marine Sciences, New Washington campus.
