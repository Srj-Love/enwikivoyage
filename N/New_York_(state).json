The ",{"type":"'''","value":["Iroquois Confederacy"]}," (or ",{"type":"'''","value":["Haudenosaunee"]},"), comprising the Cayuga, Onondaga, Seneca, Mohawk, Oneida, and Tuscarora tribes, was a major early exercise in representative democracy.\n\nEuropean settlement of New York began at New Amsterdam on Manhattan Island.  From there, Dutch and then English settlers expanded northward along the Hudson River to present-day Albany, then west along the Mohawk River.  Sites in this area of New York were pivotal in the Revolutionary War, especially at Saratoga north of Albany, and New York City served briefly as the nation's first capital.  Settlement further west was impeded by poor terrain and Indian territories, but by the early 19th century, even those areas were becoming well settled.\n\nA true population explosion was brought on by the construction of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Erie Canal"]}," from Buffalo to Albany, completed in 1825.  Cities like Rochester grew up almost overnight, able to ship their goods easily to points both east and west, and New York City at the mouth of the Hudson became the young country's busiest and most important harbor.\n\nNew York grew and thrived for decades, its cities serving as centers of industry, business, and culture for the entire nation.  Even as more and more western areas opened up and began to be settled, New York remained the Empire State.  New York Harbor served as the point of entry for countless immigrants after the Civil War, which contributed to a diverse, energetic population.\n\nNew York held the title of most populous for over 150 years and has counted numerous important and influential figures among its native sons and daughters.  Since the middle of the twentieth century, New York's influence has waned somewhat as California, Texas, and Florida have swelled in population, but New York remains one of the most dominant states in the nation.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Geography"]},"\n\nThere is no concise way to describe the geography of New York, except maybe to say it is \"diverse\".\n\nThe city of New York, a major Atlantic port, is of course at sea level.  It serves as a small fulcrum connecting ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Long Island"]]}," (to the east) and the rest of the state (to the north)—to reach one from the other, one must pass through New York City.  North of the city lies the vast majority of the state, known as \"Upstate New York\".  The land rises as one goes north, following the Hudson River upstream.  The river cuts a gorge through these Appalachian highlands, forming a wide river valley.  To the west of this valley, the Catskills rise—a \"dissected plateau\" to geologists, but just \"mountains\" to laymen.  Beyond the Catskills, the terrain drops and levels, forming the rolling hills of the Southern Tier.\n\nNorth of the Catskills is the Mohawk River valley, which runs from west to east into the Hudson.  Further west, you will find the Finger Lakes region, a series of long skinny lakes formed when river valleys were blocked by debris from retreating glaciers.  North of the Finger Lakes, between them and Lake Ontario, lie large swaths of lowlands, areas which were once underneath the surface of a much larger, pre-glacial Lake Ontario.\n\nNorth of the Mohawk valley and east of Lake Ontario, you can find the vast mountain range of the Adirondacks, which gradually give way to the St. Lawrence River valley in the northernmost part of the state.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Indian Summer 2.JPG"],["thumb"],["250px"],["The brilliant colors of autumn in New York"]]},"\n\nNew York has four distinct seasons.\n\nUpstate New York is well known for its brutal winters.  Although temperatures don't get as low as they do in areas like Minnesota and North Dakota, thanks in part to the giant heat reservoir known as Lake Ontario, that same lake serves to generate plenty of ",{"type":"'''","value":["lake-effect snow"]},".  That being said, it is not unheard of for temperatures to drop into the single digits or even below zero, especially in areas of the Adirondacks and North Country, away from the Lake. The major upstate cities compete each year for the \"coveted\" Golden Snowball Award for most total inches of snow—one small measure of pride for a city digging itself out from piles of snow several feet deep.\n\nSnow is especially heavy to the east of Lake Ontario.  Clouds pick up moisture as they travel over the lake's longest dimension, then dump it all on ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Watertown (New York)"],["Watertown"]]}," as they are forced to rise by the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Tug Hill Plateau"]},".\n\nNew York City is downright tropical by comparison.  With the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast, the Big Apple benefits from the warm Gulf Stream waters without having to deal with ocean-effect snow. Nevertheless, though New York City gets much less snow than places upstate, it is not uncommon in winter, especially January and February.\n\nSpring in New York tends to start out cold and damp, especially in areas near Lake Ontario, as the Lake's waters have by then been thoroughly chilled by winter.  True springtime comes around May, segueing quickly into summer.\n\nSummer features brilliant sun that is only rarely scorching, with occasional heat waves.  Humidity is often high but the months are punctuated by spells of lower humidity that bring everyone outside to enjoy the weather.\n\nLeaves start to turn color in September; at their peak, New York's ",{"type":"'''","value":["leaf scenery"]}," is among the best in the country.  By late October, though, it's all over but the raking, and winter begins to set in, with snow often falling by Halloween.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nEnglish is spoken throughout the state, as expected.  Other languages can be found with varying degrees of regularity in scattered pockets across the state, particularly German, Italian, and Polish.  French is sometimes heard in the North Country, due to proximity to Canada, and Spanish is common wherever Hispanics live.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nInternational travelers will almost certainly come in via one of New York City's airports; while the major upstate cities have airports that can accommodate international flights, they are now fairly rare.  Domestically, travelers will usually be coming from hubs such as Chicago, Atlanta, Charlotte, Philadelphia, or Boston.

The Thruway, a toll road for most of its length, is the primary route between the major upstate cities and is often used to get to and from New York.  Expect to pay about four cents a mile ($13.10 from Downtown Buffalo to Downtown Albany for a car with no trailer, for example).  Most New Yorkers grumble at the price but pay it anyway for the efficiency the route offers.\n\nTo allow travelers to avoid leaving the highway (and paying a toll) before they reach their destinations, the Thruway is dotted with large service plazas every 35–50 miles or so.  Each contains two or three restaurants\/snack stands (at least one restaurant will be open all night) and a gift shop\/convenience store.  Burger King, Tim Horton's, Roy Rogers, and TCBY are among the more common vendors.  Vending machines, free wi-fi, and of course gas pumps are available as well.  Gas prices are high, but such are the benefits of having a \"captive audience\".\n\nA cheaper but slightly slower route to New York City from the west is along I-86, the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Southern Tier"]]}," Expressway"]},".  State Route 17, which I-86 is supplanting, is still in the process of being upgraded to Interstate standards; east of Binghamton you'll encounter a few at-grade intersections, but it's still a quick route, and it's toll-free.\n\nThe slowest but most \"interesting\" route across the state is U.S. Route 20.  As a route stretching coast-to-coast across the northern U.S., it covers much of the same ground as Interstate 90 does today.  U.S. 20 is much older, though, traveling right through the middle of countless old villages that lie south of the Thruway.  It's a simple two-lane highway for most of its length in New York, but if you have the time and the patience, it can be more interesting than the long stretches of nothingness along the Thruway or the Southern Tier Expressway.\n\nI-81 and I-87 are the major north-south routes.  I-81 travels south from the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Thousand Islands"]]}," at the Canadian border through Syracuse and Binghamton into Pennsylvania.  I-87 (known as the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Northway"]}," north of Albany) connects Montreal in Quebec with Albany and New York City.  I-88 travels diagonally northeast-southwest, providing a connection between Binghamton and Albany.  The only significant east-west route across the top of the state is U.S. 11, which diverges from I-81 in Watertown and heads northeast, then east.\n\nIn Western New York, Rochester is connected to points south via I-390 to Corning.  From Buffalo, travelers can head southwest along I-90 or south along U.S. Route 219, which is currently being upgraded to expressway.  (Those heading southeast will take the Thruway to I-390.)\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["State routes"]},"\n\nNew York has a good network of state routes, supplemented by county routes in some counties.  Most villages are at the intersection of two or more state routes, and signage is usually clear, making it relatively simple to find your way to a particular place.  You can be fairly confident that numbered state routes will be well maintained (including plowed in the winter) and rarely too far from civilization.  Some interesting itineraries can be devised just by following a particular route wherever it leads.\n\nIn general, one- and two-digit state routes will be primary routes, although plenty of exceptions exist; you shouldn't assume anything just from the number.  Major cross-state routes include 3, 5, 7, 17, and 104.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Safety"]},"\n\nMunicipalities in New York are well prepared for winter weather, but it can get so severe at times that even their expert crews can't keep up.

Follow a snowplow (at a safe distance!) if you can, though watch out for ones dropping salt.\n\nCell phone service can be spotty in the northern part of the state; be aware that you may not be able to easily call for help on the highways in that region.\n\nA few miscellaneous traffic laws:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" State law mandates that your headlights must be on if your windshield wipers are running."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Drivers, front-seat passengers, and children sitting anywhere must wear seat belts with primary enforcement."]},{"type":"*","value":[" You are not permitted to use hand-held cellular phones while driving; hands-free phones are permitted but use with extra caution."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Turning right on red light is permitted after stop, except where signs indicate otherwise like \"NO TURN ON RED\".

The Erie runs from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Buffalo"]]}," all the way to the Hudson River at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Albany (New York)"],["Albany"]]},", but there are several smaller canals that connect the Erie to other waterways: the Cayuga-Seneca Canal to the Finger Lakes, the Oswego Canal to Lake Ontario, and the Champlain Canal to Lake Champlain. This extensive network means you can, in theory, see the six biggest cities in the state all without leaving your boat.\n\nThe canals are drained and unusable between November 16 and April 30 each winter... not that you'd want to be out on them anyway.  The canals open at 7AM and close between 5PM and 10PM depending on season.  Call toll-free 1-800-4CANAL4 (422-6254) for canal information and conditions.\n\nThere are locks and sometimes lift bridges throughout the system, and if you want to go through any of them, you'll need to purchase a permit.  Two-day, ten-day, and all-season passes are available, and the price varies based on the length of your vessel. You can purchase permits ahead of time by mail, or in person at any Canal Corporation Sectional Office; many of these offices are located next to locks or bridges, but not every lock or bridge has one. The canal web site has a list of offices, and forms for mailing. Permit fees as of 2012:\n\n",{"type":"{|","value":[["class=\"wikitable\""],["|-"],["! scope=\"col\" | Boat size !!

The Statue of Liberty in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New York City"],["New York"]]}," Harbor is something every American should see at least once, and many a tourist has passed the time just gawking at every sight in Manhattan.  Certainly the Big Apple has the lion's share of the state's museums and landmarks, but that's no excuse for ignoring upstate.

Obviously, the busiest time of year is the summer—which can be glorious—but localities work hard to make sure there's plenty to keep residents and visitors occupied even in the depths of winter.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["New York City"]]}," is the cultural center of the country, never mind the state, with countless theaters and world-renowned sports teams.  None of the upstate cities compares in profile or in prominence, but each of them has a selection of first-class attractions and amenities sufficient to support tourism, without the crowds and frenetic activity of their larger neighbor.  And when it comes to recreation, the Big Apple can't hold a candle to upstate's natural landscapes.\n\nThe mountainous terrain of the Catskills and the Adirondacks is perfect for hiking and camping, while the numerous waterways of the state—including Lake Ontario, Lake Erie, the Erie Canal, and the Hudson River—all see regular boat traffic throughout the summer months.  Hunting and fishing are also big business upstate.\n\nNew York will never be mistaken for Colorado by winter sports enthusiasts, but the unique glacial terrain of Western New York and the mountainous Adirondacks provide for some pretty good skiing. (Keep an eye out in late 2014 for state-sponsored bus service from Toronto and New York City to upstate ski resorts!)  Ice rinks (most of them indoor, allowing year-round skating) abound as well.  One of the premier winter-sports destinations is sleepy little ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lake Placid"]]},", which has twice hosted the Winter Olympics and is home to Herb Brooks Arena, site of the 1980 Miracle on Ice.\n\nOenophiles can visit one of the top wine regions in the country in the Finger Lakes; the entire region is dotted with small towns and villages of historic character, with almost 100 wineries in between.  The region produces perhaps the best Rieslings outside of Germany, and Finger Lakes ice wines are growing in popularity.  Wine tours, which let you visit multiple wineries in a single trip, are also starting to see huge crowds.\n\nNew York's agriculture is also on display at the numerous county fairs held in late summer.  The biggest of these by far is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Erie County Fair"]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hamburg (New York)"],["Hamburg"]]},", south of Buffalo—it's the third-largest (and one of the oldest) county fair in the country and rivals even the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Great New York State Fair"]}," (held just outside ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Syracuse (New York)"],["Syracuse"]]},") in popularity.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Sports"]},"\n\nNew Yorkers love all kinds of sports.

New York is also a hotbed for amateur hockey, and no state has more varsity college hockey teams than New York.  Ten New York colleges and universities play Division I men's hockey, and eight play women's hockey; fourteen have D-III teams.\n\nNew York high schools are producing some outstanding lacrosse players, and that's reflected in the growing popularity of professional lacrosse.  Rochester and Buffalo both have indoor teams in the National Lacrosse League, while Rochester and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hempstead"]]}," (on Long Island) have outdoor teams in Major League Lacrosse; both leagues feature the sport's top professionals.\n\nSoccer is very popular among the youth of New York, but professional soccer has struggled to make inroads.

New York City, of course, as the point of arrival for so many immigrants, is home to some of the most authentic and most diverse ethnic cuisines in the country.  Even upstate, though, in cities not known for their diversity, you can find plenty of variety.\n\nAmerican cuisine is ubiquitous, of course, except perhaps in areas of New York City like Chinatown and Little Italy.  Italian food (much of it Americanized, admittedly) is also found throughout the state.  Asian cuisines—mostly Chinese and Japanese, but with some Thai and Indian restaurants in the larger cities—are also common.  Greek food is readily available, primarily at family restaurants that also serve plenty of American food and a smattering of Italian.  Polish specialties can be found in Buffalo, and the North Country has some French-Canadian influence in its cuisine.\n\nNotably, each of the upstate cities seems to have its own unique home-grown dishes.  Buffalo is famous for its chicken wings, of course, but also features \"beef on weck\".  Rochester is home to \"white hots\" and the late-night favorite \"garbage plates\".  Syracuse has salt potatoes, the Utica-Rome area has its \"chicken riggies\", \"spiedies\" originated in Binghamton, and Plattsburgh residents favor \"Michigan\" hot dogs.  While perhaps not as famous as Philadelphia's cheese steaks, most of these local favorites are worth trying, if only to get a taste of the local \"flavor\". From the Finger Lakes region all the way up to the North Country, Amish and Mennonite communities contribute fresh vegetables, fruits, and baked goods that are often found at road-side farm stands or at farmers markets.\n\nMany visitors don't realize that New York still has a very large agriculture industry.  The state is one of the top American producers of apples, grapes, milk, sweet corn, and maple syrup.
