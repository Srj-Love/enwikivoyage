Infants and toddlers don't count as long as they sit on an adult's lap. Occasionally you can find a mini-van taxi that will seat up to five people. Taxis do not carry infant or booster seats and children are allowed to ride without one. Most New Yorkers don't bother with a booster seat though some will carry an infant seat for the baby.If you want your child to be strapped into one, bring your own. The trunk in a taxi is huge and a Maclaren stroller will fit inside without having to be folded up.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Subway"]}," can be fun as well as a challenge. While older kids will love the clatter of trains and enjoy watching the express rush by without stopping, parents with younger kids may have to negotiate an ancient system with their strollers. There are few escalators or elevators in New York subway stations and the odds are you'll have to lug your stroller up and down the steps. Fortunately, the tracks are just a few feet below street level so the lugging is not extensive. If you are alone and stand around long enough, someone will offer to help. If you have a stroller and want to take it through the turnstiles without folding it, you must use a subway entrance with a manned token booth. A doorway next to token booths (labeled 'Emergency Exit') provides entry for passengers in wheelchairs or people with strollers. Inform the token booth attendant that you wish to use the door, slide your card through the turnstile and turn it with your hand, return to the door and pass through. Looks complicated but it is really quite easy! Technically, children under 48 inches ride free on the subway but any kid who looks like a kid can duck under the turnstiles and enter the system.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Bus"]},". If you have younger kids, note that strollers must be folded and carried onto a bus. Buses are a nice, above ground, way to see the city but can be very slow if you're traveling more than a few blocks. Look for \"Limited\" buses if you're planning to go a long way (for example, on the M4 from the Metropolitan Museum to the Cloisters).\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Walking"]}," is the best way to enjoy the city. In winter it can get very cold and you will spend more time outdoors than you do at home so dress your children in warm clothes.
