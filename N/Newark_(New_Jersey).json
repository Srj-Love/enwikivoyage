Although one of the great historic cities of the Northeast and the most culture-rich city in the state, Newark is often overlooked in favor of Goliath-like Manhattan and towns along the Hudson River, such as Jersey City and Hoboken. While no longer the industrial powerhouse it once was, Newark remains one of America's major shipping, rail, and air hubs. Public transportation is abundant, making it easy to get to, from, and around the city.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Newark skyline Prudential Headquarters.jpg"],["thumb"],["458px"],["Newark Skyline"]]},"\n\nNewark has been economically disadvantaged for some time, and suffers from a bad reputation, often informed by negative stereotyping. Thanks in large part to a nationally high-profile mayor (Cory Booker, now a U.S. Senator), committed populace, and changing attitudes towards once decaying urban areas, the often proclaimed, but stunted renaissance of Newark is steadily and substantially taking hold. \n\nThe city is divided into five wards, each with its own character. Downtown has retained much of early 20th century architecture and has an iconic skyline. Nearly 100,000 people commute to the central business district on workdays, making for a lively urban landscape. Since the millennium it has become more residential as former office buildings and warehouses, such as the art deco Eleven80 (at 1180 Raymond Blvd.), are converted to housing. A new performing arts complex and sports\/concert venue and restaurants have encouraged visitors to linger longer into the night, \n\nThe North Ward is home to Branch Brook Park, site of the nation's largest collection of cherry blossom trees, and the neo-Gothic Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart. Surrounding neighborhoods include architecturally interesting suburban enclaves on the east and bustling urban districts on the west. The East Ward, or the Ironbound, is home to a large Portuguese\/Brazilian community, with a \"restaurant row\" offering a cornucopia of eating establishments for every budget. The South Ward, once the heart of the Jewish community and home to the Weequahic Park and architectural gems, has fallen on hard times, and is were much of the city's crime is concentrated. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Manhattan2.jpg"],["thumb"],["upright 1.8"],["Port Newark, Jersey City, and Manhattan from Newark Airport.

Car theft and car jackings are the biggest crime in Newark. Home invasions come in second. Downtown Newark is crowded and safe during the day.  It empties out at night and may seem creepy, but as long as you stay in well lit open areas you should be fine. The Ironbound district has most of the great restaurants and is pretty bumpin' on nights and weekends and is probably the safest part of the city, behind Downtown and residential Forest Hill. If you were to go to a concert at the NJ Symphony Hall or see an event at the Prudential Center you should be fine. They are well lit areas with a police presence and are the safest part of the city. \n\nThe North, South and Central Wards have heavier crime rates and it pays to be more guarded in those areas.\n\nAlthough bustling during peak travel hours and almost completely safe in daylight, Newark Broad Street station (NJ Transit) can be very dangerous after hours and through the night when fewer people wait for trains (usually from 10pm-5am). Armed robberies are common and can occur even when you are not the only one waiting for a late train. If you do find yourself at the station after hours, wait in the lobby beneath the platform, or failing that, one of the lit waiting booths on the platform. Look confident, dignified, and do NOT display cell phones or iPods.\n\nRemember, the best advice to be given about doing business in 'stickier' neighborhoods is just keep your wits about you. If caught in a confrontation, act confident, no matter how scared you might actually be. Afterwards, make yourself scarce, fast. Remember that money and material things can be replaced, while lives cannot.

From there, get to an on-ramp and put out your thumb. Be advised, however, that New Jersey state laws on hitchhiking are notoriously ambiguous, and you will be hassled by local police, so use common sense and discretion. If you're trying to go west into Pennsylvania, your best bet is to take NJ transit to Mt.
