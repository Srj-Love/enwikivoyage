Here, in Hydesville, stood a cottage where a peddler was murdered, and where the Fox family came to live in 1847.  On March 31, 1848, the two daughters of John D. Fox claimed they could communicate with the dead through a series of 'intelligible rappings.' Margaret Fox (1834-1893) and Kate Fox (1836-1892) soon took to holding seances in nearby Rochester, where their older sister lived.  The rappings were thought to have been produced through a variety of tricks, including a snapping sound from their toe joints.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Biking, Hiking, and Fishing on the Erie Canal Path"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat=43.0475"],["long=-77.0946"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=There is a great section of the Erie Canal Path that runs from T.
