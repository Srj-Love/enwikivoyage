The refuge contains a wide variety of habitats including beaches, sand dunes, saltmarshes, salt pannes, freshwater impoundments, and maritime forests. The large salt pannes located on the west side of the refuge road are excellent places to see a large variety of shorebirds during fall migration (July through September) and egrets and herons from mid-April through October. The Hellcat Wildlife Observation Area has large freshwater impoundments, an extensive swamp, and deciduous forest. The impoundments and swamp usually support large numbers of waterfowl, herons, and shorebirds. The woodlands are excellent places during the spring and fall to observe large numbers of migrating songbirds, including the magnificent wood-warblers. Near the southern end of the island, Stage Island Pool is also excellent for waterfowl and waders. Sandy Point State Reservation at the sound end of Plum Island is a breeding area for the endangered Piping Plover during the summer and a very productive site in fall for shorebirds. During the winter, the Parker River National Wildlife Refuge is a great place to see waterfowl plus many northern species that winter in our area.
