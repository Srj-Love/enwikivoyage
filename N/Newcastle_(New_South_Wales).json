The second largest city in the state of NSW and sixth largest in Australia, Newcastle city had a population of 153,000 in 2008 and the suburban area had over 500,000.  The city is the focal point for a diverse district that encompasses beaches and mountains, restaurants and wineries.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nNewcastle is Australia's oldest sea port, currently the second most important in the country in terms of overall tonnage. It is also the world's largest coal exporter. The city of Newcastle is the hub for exploring the many activities and sights that surround the city.\nIn the north is Stockton beach, miles and miles of uninhabited beaches that stretch up to Nelson bay. The wreck of the Signa can be seen from Fort Scratchley, which was Newcastle's maritime defence during the world wars. Travel westward to the wineries and taste some of Australia's best wines. Barrington Tops National Park in the north west has beautiful fresh water rivers and rain forests, a good place to spot a platypus. Newcastle is a great place for surfers, wine buffs, bush walkers, and anyone interested in Australian history.\n\nSince the closure of the BHP steelworks, Hunter New England Health and The University of Newcastle have become the city's primary employers.\n\nMany Novocastrians take an avid interest in sports, as participants, spectators or both.  The local NRL Rugby League team, the Newcastle Knights are widely followed.  Newcastle also hosts soccer, baseball, ice hockey, netball and various other sporting teams.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Tourist Information Centre"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Newcastle Visitor Information Centre"],["url="],["email=tourism@ncc.nsw.gov.au"],["address=Honeysuckle Wharf, Newcastle CBD"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Now relocated to the Martime Centre, Honeysuckle Wharf"],["phone=+61 2 4929 5948"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=M-F 9AM-5PM, Sa-Su 10AM-3PM"],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nNewcastle is a two hour drive north of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sydney"]]}," on the M1 Motorway which starts at Wahroonga (close to Hornsby) on the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sydney\/Upper North Shore"],["Upper North Shore"]]},". The freeway is in excellent condition and driving is normally not difficult. However, as a large number of people commute to Sydney daily from the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Central Coast (New South Wales)"],["Central Coast"]]}," and even Newcastle, northbound travellers during the evening peak (5PM to 7PM) will encounter high speed and heavy traffic between Wahroonga and the Central Coast, with traffic easing off further north. The reverse applies to southbound traffic during the morning commute.\n\nThe M1 is on the Western side of Lake Macquarie. To travel up the Eastern side of Lake Macquarie (through Swansea) then take the \"Charlestown\" exit on the M1. This route is more scenic, more hilly, and less congested (though it takes a few minutes longer). If you follow this route you will eventually come to the \"Charlestown Bypass\" at Bennett's Green which you can take if you wish to head north-west (towards Lambton). Otherwise veer right to keep following the Pacific Highway until you reach Charlestown and then follow the signs to the city.\n\nTraffic during holiday periods and long weekends is also affected, with heavy northbound traffic at the beginning of the period as Sydneysiders flee the city for the weekend, and heavy southbound traffic as they return.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\nSydney's Central, Strathfield, Epping and Hornsby stations have  ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/transportnsw.info hourly trains"]},"  to Newcastle Station via the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Central Coast (New South Wales)"],["Central Coast"]]},".

These trains are more expensive than intercity services and tickets must be booked in advance, but they are somewhat more comfortable and are also faster. Occasionally NSW Trainlink discount tickets offer discounts, and $1 fares for kids, so it may be worthwhile checking their fares.\n\nHowever, work is set to begin on a light rail service which will mean the trains will terminate as far away as Broadmeadow. The light rail is planned to link the CBD to the outer suburbs, including Broadmeadow, which is home to Hunter Stadium.
