Newfoundland was first discovered by Europeans in about 1000AD by the Vikings, but they did not last.  In 1497 Italian explorer John Cabot may have discovered Newfoundland, and claimed it for England.  Both Newfoundland and Labrador soon became popular places for European fishermen and whalers exploiting the Atlantic coast to come ashore for supply and rest.  Newfoundland was the first overseas outpost of the British Empire: Sir Humphrey Gilbert landed in St John's in August 1583, and formally took possession of the island for the British, who were slow to populate the island, however.  The small French presence on the island was mostly eliminated by 1760.  During the 19th century, Newfoundland received an influx of Irish settlers, added another layer to present-day character of the island in terms of its unique regional accents and musical traditions.  Newfoundland choose not to join Canadian Confederation in 1867, and became a self-governing colony, and by 1907 a Dominion, legally equivalent to Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.  Newfoundland was devastated by huge losses of young men during the First World War and economic crisis during the Great Depression, and voluntarily gave up its independence to Britain in 1934 in exchange for a debt bailout.  This situation ended in 1949 when Newfoundlanders and Labradorians narrowly voted in a referendum to join Canada as the tenth province.  Newfoundland experienced another economic crisis in the later twentieth century.  Stocks of the all-important cod fish collapsed and the Canadian government declared a moratorium on fishing for that species in 1992, ending the province's largest and oldest industry overnight.  Likewise the seal hunt, another major industry, has been under threat due to anti-fur boycotts in Europe and elsewhere.  Newfoundlanders have been emigrating to mainland Canada in large numbers for generations.  But as well offshore oil and gas drilling, inland mining and hydroelectricity, and tourism have recently taken on a greater role in the economy, making Newfoundland and Labrador a net payer into the Canadian interprovincial transfer system for the first time ever in 2008.\n\nThe beauty of Newfoundland can be found on the rocky coasts of the island and the relatively new, and stunningly beautiful East Coast Trail, but this is a truly coast-to-coast kind of place. There's much to see in the Tundra of Labrador (often called \"the Big Land\"), the \"mini-Rockies\" of the West Coast's Long Range Mountains and Lewis Hills, the historic Avalon Peninsula, home to the capital of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["St. John's"]]},". Also don't underestimate the power of the largely uninhabited Newfoundland interior. There is a raw, untouched quality to the entire place, especially where water meets rocks. Adventure racer Mats Andersson has described it as a mix of \"",{"type":"[[","value":[["Patagonia"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sweden"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Zealand"]]}," and other countries from all around the world.\"\n\nAs for the people, everyone talks to everyone; indeed, everyone helps everyone, and everyone knows everyone (people often can tell what part of the island someone is from by their last name). \n\nNewfoundlanders are known for their distinctive manner of speech. Believe it or not, they speak dialects (that's right, not accents) that are sometimes unintelligible to \"mainland\" Canadians - especially in outports such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Burgeo"]]},". Its roots (while still North American English) are mainly Irish, English and French, and the language has evolved and developed in semi-isolation for about 500 years. The Dictionary of Newfoundland English is about the size of a standard English dictionary. It is immediately noticeable to most visitors, or \"Come-From-Aways\" as they are occasionally called, that the syntax and grammar varies slightly. As for the accent, it varies from district to district in the province. As Canadian author Douglas Coupland puts it in Souvenir of Canada, Newfoundlanders \"speak in a dialect that can rival Navajo for indecipherability - that is, when they really ham it up...\" . \n\nNewfoundlanders pronounce Newfoundland to rhyme with 'understand,' placing emphasis on -LAND, not New or found-. It sounds something like \"newfin-LAND.\" Canadians outside of the Atlantic provinces (therefore, not including Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia as well as Newfoundland) and tourists are noted for their pronunciation of Newfoundland as \"new-FOUND-lind\", \"NEW-fin-lind\" or \"NEW-found-lind.\"\n\nTwo \"traditions\" persist with a visit to Newfoundland—kissing the cod and the \"screech-in.\" (Both were actually enacted by Ben Mulroney in the Canadian Idol television show while he visited Newfoundland, demonstrating how widespread these activities are thought to be). These \"traditions\" are little more than tourist activities originally invented by locals for a laugh. The tourists found them enjoyable, and now they are becoming extremely common. Commercial tours will often include these activities, concluding them with a certificate proclaiming the participant an honorary Newfoundlander.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" the \"Screech-in\"- The most famous of newcomer traditions, mainlanders and visitors to the isle must drink a shot or glass of Screech (a brand of Jamaican Rum famous to Newfoundland). Take this all in good humour, but don't be surprised if you don't like the taste; the name has good meaning."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Kissing the Cod- As well as being \"Screeched in\", occasionally visitors will be coaxed into \"Kissing the Cod\". The visitor must kiss a codfish, emblem of the historic fishing industry, after arrival. While this does happen occasionally, it is usually a humorous part of a guided tour or similar event. The use of an actual fish is rare, though, especially since the introduction of the cod moratorium. Kissing a real codfish is discouraged by many, not to mention possibly unhygienic, so an imitation cod, made of wood, plastic, or rubber is used."]},"\nGenuine traditions practised in Newfoundland include celebrations of: \"Bonfire Night\", with roots in the English \"Guy Fawkes Night\"; and \"Old Christmas Day\" which is the twelfth night of the Christmas season. The latter of these is also associated with the tradition of \"Mummering\" or \"Janneying\" which is still practiced in several other parts of the world as well.\n\nAnd finally, the \"Newfie\" (also \"Newf\") stereotype: in Canada, this figure is similar to the Hillbilly stereotype or the rural Hick stereotype. As with both of those cases, it is rooted in discrimination. While some Newfoundlanders may call themselves \"Newfies\", it may be wise to refrain from calling the province's residents as such yourself, as many see this as a slur or putdown when it comes from a non-native. Not unlike \"Canuck\", originally a slur against Canadians, the word \"Newfie\" is acceptable to some, but err on the side of caution and use Newfoundlander instead.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Gros Morne NP westernbrookpond2.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Gros Morne National Park"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nFlights from major centres in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Newark, New Jersey"],["Newark"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ontario"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Quebec"]]}," and the other ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Atlantic Provinces"]]}," arrive at St. John's airport ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.stjohnsairport.com"]}," several times per day. \n\nFlights to Stephenville ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cyjt.com\/"]}," from Toronto are available during the summer months and allow easy travel to the nearby city of Corner Brook ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cornerbrook.com\/"]},".

During calf season, moose can be especially aggressive, standing their ground and even challenging people and vehicles, but the most common risk is collision. Remember that hitting a moose is not like hitting a deer-most of its bulk is above the height of the average car's front hood. Your car will hit its legs, knocking the brunt of its quarter tonne (1100 lb+) weight into the windshield and you. This is the last thing you want to have happen to you, and it may well be the last thing that will happen to you! It is for this reason that moose are considered one of the most dangerous animals in North America.

Rural restaurants offer an over-abundance of \"golden foods\" (deep fried) and classically simple fare. Vegetarians will be hard pressed to find anything without meat in it, and vegans might want to pack a lunch. But if you're a fish and chips lover, you'll \"fill your boots\". Mainly you will see battered cod, \"chips dressing and gravy\", dressing being a savory-laced stuffing mixture, fish-and-brewis (pronounced \"fish and brews\", salt cod mashed up with a boiled rock-hard sailor's bread, pork scrunchions, and traditionally drizzled with blackstrap molasses), jigg's dinner (also known as corned beef and cabbage, a traditional one pot meal consisting of salt beef,root vegetables such as carrot, turnip, parsnip and potato,and cabbage. Also thrown in the pot is a muslin bag of yellow split peas, known as pease pudding), burgers and fries, and seafood chowder. \n\nBut if you're nice, and lucky, someone might invite you in to their home for a homemade moose stew, rabbit pie, seal flipper, caribou sausage, partridgeberry pie or a cuppa tea with home-baked bread and homemade bakeapple jam. All of these are very interesting and delicious. A big traditional meal is often referred to as \"a scoff\", and as Newfoundlanders also love to dance and party, an expression for a dance and a feed is a \"scoff and scuff\", which might be accompanied by accordion, guitar, fiddle, a singalong, and a kitchen party. Kitchen socials are so much a part of Newfoundland culture that even today, many houses are better equipped to receive visitors through the back door (leading to the kitchen) than through the front.\n\nFish has always been at the heart of Newfoundland culture and even with the collapse of the commercial fisheries, you will find seafood dishes almost everywhere. Cod, halibut, flounder, crab, lobster, squid, mussels, and capelin (a small fish not unlike smelt or grunion) are all well represented. So too are other animals supported by the ocean system - seal, turr (murre) and the like.\n\nA lot of Newfoundlanders habitually drink tea with evaporated or \"canned\" milk (a popular brand being Nestle Carnation milk). If you prefer \"regular\" milk, you usually ask for \"tea with fresh milk\" and this is, in fact, a good way to spot a Newfoundlander (or at least an Atlantic Province native) in other parts of the country. An easy excuse to have a friendly chat is to invite someone in for a \"cuppa tea\". \n\nIn \"town\" i.e. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["St. John's"]]}," (and the other city centres of Newfoundland) there are many good restaurants for the picking, and several vegetarian and vegan friendly spots.\n\nWhile in Newfoundland, particularly St. John's, do try to sample some of the candy and sweets from Purity Factories, an island fixture for many years and makers of several traditional-style confections. For many Newfoundlanders, Christmas would not be the same without a bottle of Purity Syrup, and breakfast without some of their partridgeberry and apple jam wouldn't be right. (Note: Partridgeberries in Newfoundland are referred to in many other places as \"lingonberries\".)\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nYou will be in for a \"time\" (a social gathering) with lots of cheer. This is a province that consumes per capita more alcohol than any other in Canada. The legal drinking age in the province is 19. You will find nearly all the alcohol you desire in a Newfoundland bar.  George Street in St. John's, Newfoundland has a reputation for having the most bars per capita in North America.  Its largest celebration, George Street Festival, starts in early August and finishes on the Tuesday before Regatta Day.\n\nNewfoundland & Labrador has a wonderful set of regional beers that you cannot find outside of the province. While a number of these are now brewed by the large Macrobreweries (Labatt and Molson), some of them are not. Depending on where you are, you will be able to locate brews with names like Kyle, Killick, Rasberry Wheat Ale, Hemp Ale, India, Black Horse, Jockey Club, Dominion Ale, Quidi Vidi 1892, and Blue Star. Something you may notice while drinking beer in the province is the tendency for the breweries to advertise that their beers are union-made \"right here\" in Newfoundland. Beer is commonly found in convenience stores with a liquor license and from the Newfoundland Liquor Corporation (NLC). The NLC is a government-owned monopoly and, much like most of Canada, there is a better selection of local and foreign beers than there are provincial beers. Inter-province trade in beer tends to be limited to the major brands, with no attention paid to the many excellent craft breweries in other regions. \n\nWhile in Newfoundland, you will also encounter Screech. Screech is a Jamaican-style dark rum. This is the historic result of the trade between Newfoundland and Jamaica. Jamaica got the salt cod, Newfoundland got the rum. In all honesty, the Rum has been tamed to conform with contemporary liquor laws, especially when compared to descriptions of its much more potent ancestor. Hard liquor is usually found only at the Newfoundland Liquor Corporation in urban areas, and in licensed convenience stores in rural areas.\n\nNewfoundland has a quiet but strong tradition of berry wines. Blueberry wine, for those in the know, is as closely associated with Newfoundland tastes as Screech, and for many, may be a far more palatable first experience. Also be sure to look for partridgeberry, blackberry, cloudberry, and rhubarb wines. All of these can often be found in NLC outlets. The NLC retains the distinction of being the only liquor control boards in Canada which still directly manufactures and bottles several of its hard liquor products (Screech, notably, but also gin, brandy and two vodkas), to retain the strong provincial association.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay Safe"]},"\nThe only dangers of which tourists should be mindful are related to nature and not to crime.
