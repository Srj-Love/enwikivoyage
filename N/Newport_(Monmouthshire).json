Usually, you will encounter no problems, however at times the city centre can be slightly intimidating and conflict between locals is not an uncommon sight. Unfortunately, yobbish behaviour from deprived youths is on the rise in Newport. Unknown to them, this causes problems for the city's reputation and even economy.\nNewport's rough reputation is unfortunately very accurate at night. Non locals may find themselves extremely intimidated at night as thuggish behaviour is on the rise, the best way to avoid trouble at night in Newport is to always stay in groups, as the more yobbish kind will start a fight over something as small as accidently being bumped into. Note that in certain bars such as the Meze Lounge and Lloyds Queens Hotel you will be much safer than places such as Revolution.\nVisitors should be aware that while you may be intimidated, your personal safety in Newport on the whole is not really at risk, in the unlikely event that a threatening situation occurs it is best to simply move on and avoid offending anybody. Rest assured that the problems described above lie mainly within the youths of the city, and most people you meet will be friendly!! Newport is without a doubt the roughest city in Wales... but remember we only have 6!!\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["51.587739"],["-2.998344"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Monmouthshire"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Newport"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Europe\/United_Kingdom\/Wales\/Newport\/"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Newport, Wales"]]}]
