The city itself is situated in a valley from where the peaks of the Mourne, Cooley and south Armagh mountains can been seen.\n\nThe city has existed as a settlement for well over 850 years. When John De Courcy came to Ireland in the twelfth century he established significant bases at Newry,",{"type":"[[","value":[["Carlingford"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Carrickfergus"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Coleraine"]]}," all of which developed into towns and monasteries.   \n\nAfter the Irish war of independence to drive the British out of Ireland(1919 – 1921), a truce was called and a treaty was signed which partitioned the Country, despite being a nationalist town, Newry fell on the northern side of the border. As a result of partition Newry people, because of their nationalist sympathies suffered greatly from mass unemployment and discrimination inflicted on them by a Unionist lead government.\n\nNewry is thankfully seeing better days. It is a major population centre almost equidistant from Belfast and Dublin, and the border partitioning the island is almost non-existent. However, economically, it’s a different story.
