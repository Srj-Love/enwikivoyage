While mainly a suburb of Boston, it is a sizable city in its own right, boasting a population of over 80,000.  Each village has its own historical and architectural character. Many of the villages grew up around railroad stations after the Boston & Worcester Railroad opened up through the north side of Newton in 1833. Another railroad line opened up across the south side of Newton in 1851 and is the \"D\" Branch of the MBTA's Green Line today. Walking tours of most villages are available through the website of the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ci.newton.ma.us\/Planning\/hist\/history.htm Newton City Planning Department"]},".\n\nStriking enclaves of Victorian houses and Gothic Revival churches can be seen in Auburndale, Chestnut Hill, Newton Centre, Newton Corner, Newton Highlands, and Newtonville, and West Newton Hill. Newton's grandest boulevard is Commonwealth Avenue, which winds through the entire city and is lined with historic mansions.  \"Comm Ave,\" as it is known to Bostonians, connects Boston to Weston and serves as the route of the Boston Marathon (Patriot's Day, third Monday of April). Heartbreak Hill begins just east of Newton City Hall.  Divided down the middle by a landscaped mall that runs throughout the city, the street was designed by celebrated landscape architect Fredrick Law Olmstead, who also designed Central Park in New York City and the Emerald Necklace in Boston.\n\nFor trivia buffs: in 1886, Nabisco's Fig Newton cookie was named after the City of Newton.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Logan International Airport"]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boston"]]}," is the most convenient and has various ground transportation alternatives available.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train or bus"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Mass Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA)"]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.mbta.com"]},".
