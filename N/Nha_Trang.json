It's more lively and urban in character than other beach destinations like Mui Ne and Phu Quoc. It's also the scuba diving centre of Vietnam.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nTraces of human settlement in Nha Trang date back to the Cham Empire, though in times of Vietnamese rule, there wasn't much more here than small fishing villages. The French recognised that this beautiful bay, with its islands and white sand beaches, made for a perfect bathing spot, and began the transformation into a resort town. American soldiers agreed, and Nha Trang became a favourite R&R stop during the war.\n\nThe monsoon season is from Oct to mid-Dec. Sea winds can be heavy, and sometimes the weather can get pretty chilly. Summer, naturally, brings many vacation goers into town and hotel rooms get somewhat more difficult to find.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Cam Ranh International Airport"]}," (CXR), built on the grounds of the old American airbase in 2004, is 30 km from the city and serves only domestic destinations and Russia. Taxi fare from the airport to downtown locations is a fixed rate of 380,000 dong, though many hotels have their own buses. Do not offer to go by the meter here as it is about 100,000 dong more expensive than the fixed rate.\n\nA cheaper option is to take the airport bus at 70,000 dong to the old Nha Trang Airport. They sell the tickets for this minibus at a desk near the exit of the airport. The old airport terminal is in the city not far from most hotels and taxis can be found there. Most city hotels should be reached by taxi for 30,000 dong or less. Mini-hotel alley at 64 Tran Phu costs just 15,000 dong. From Nha Trang (Old Airport Terminal) to Cam Ranh Airport the shuttle bus leaves 2 hours before each scheduled flight for the same price.\n\nMai Linh taxis offer fixed price fares to and from the airport, starting at 180,000 dong for a small, 4-seat taxi.  For the adventurous traveller, take a short taxi ride to a Phuong Trang bus stop in Cam Ranh, then catch the Phuong Trang bus, 40,000 dong to Nha Trang (about an hour). The bus stops and the buses are orange coloured.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nNha Trang is a stop on the main railway-line connecting ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hanoi"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ho Chi Minh City"]]}," (HCMC or Saigon). The railway station is close to the cathedral in the north part of town. If you want a soft-sleeper (the highest class available on Vietnamese trains), book your train ticket directly at the train station as far in advance as you are able. Having a private travel agent book this ticket will quite often result in you paying the agent for a soft-sleeper — the agent will book a hard-sleeper and you will not know until you board the train and it is too late to make changes. This is one of the most common scams in Vietnam!  Soft sleeper rooms are 4 berth, hard sleepers are 6 berth. You can sit comfortably on a lower bed in a 4 berth room but in a 6 berth you will have to be very short in order to sit up straight. SNT trains (meaning Saigon to Nha Trang) have similar quality cars, but are slower than the SE trains. The TN trains have the oldest and dirtiest cars and are the slowest so therefore are not recommended. Each of the SE, TN and SNT coded trains end with a number. If the number is odd it travels from north to south. If it is even, it travels from south to north.\n\nThe journey to Nha Trang from Ho Chi Minh City takes between 6-8 hours on SE trains (often delayed), so a sleeper is not really necessary, a cushioned seat in the air-con car costs 190,000 dong. Soft seats are 310,000 dong. The SNT trains take over 9 hours and travel overnight only. The SNT2 departs Ho Chi Minh City at 19:40 and arrives in Nha Trang at 06:00. The train station is about 1 km from the city centre, so you can easily walk.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Bus"]},"\nNearly all long distance sleeper buses stop in Nha Trang, including the open bus.  This is the way most travelers arrive to Nha Trang from anywhere else in Vietnam. Buses to Nha Trang can be booked from any bus company or travel agent at quite low rates. Sleeper buses usually drop you off on the side of the street somewhat near the tourist areas.  A short walk or $2 taxi or motorbike ride can get you to your hotel from the drop off point.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nPrivate car rental with a driver are usually modern air-con cars and can be rented for about 1,000,000 dong per day. Car rental prices (as mostly anything in Vietnam) usually increase during holiday seasons especially around Tet (Vietnamese New Year). Make sure to avoid high prices by booking it beforehand with the car rental services.\n\nYou can also arrange private taxi transfer from to Mui Ne with ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/saigon2muine.com\/transfer\/airport-taxi-tour\/nha-trang-mui-ne Saigon2MuiNe"]},". Book and pay on-line via PayPal. No hidden fee.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nToday, most of the tourist infrastructure is in the southern part of town around ",{"type":"'''","value":["Biet Thu"]},", whereas most of the locals live around the Cho Dam in the northern half. Cho Dam Market is a popular destination for visitors as well, though.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Tran Phu"]}," is the backbone of the city, accompanied by a pleasant waterfront promenade, palm trees, and the nearly 6 km of beach.\n\nNha Trang has a reliable and easy-to-navigate public bus system, where the ticket fare does not exceed 3,000 dong for a ride on a modern, air-conditioned bus with Vietnamese music. You will find buses 2 and 3 the most useful, since they pass through the southern quarters. Alternatively, you'll find the usual selection of taxis, cyclos, and motorbikes.\n\nThere is no destination in downtown Nha Trang that justifies a fare higher than 20,000 dong\/person. Taxis are a good option, but be sure they turn on the meter to get the cheapest price.\n\nA wonderful option for seeing the sites is to hire a cyclo-driver for the day. This runs about USD15 plus tip. All the in-town highlights, the post office, and my choice of restaurants from 08:00-19:00. English skills may be basic. The driver will keep the touts away--a real bonus!\n\nIts also easy to get around by bicycle. Nha Trang is quite flat and bicycles are easily found for hire, typically 20,000 dong for one day for a basic no-gears bike. Locals on bicycles are more commonly seen at night when its cooler and no sun to burn their skin.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThe beach is the main draw here. But the beaches are littered and the water can also be polluted, so if you are going to Nha Trang specifically for the beach, and have been to other Asian destinations such as Thailand and the Philippines you are likely to be very disappointed. You will see many female vendors walking along the beach selling fruit and hot, steamed seafood.\n\nMake sure that you visit in the right season. The beach can be disappointing when the weather is grey and the waves choppy. The experience is then one of murky sandy waters, a strip of standard brown sand with a multitude of empty beach chairs and no one to be seen.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Alexandre Yersin Museum"],["url="],["email="],["address=10 Tran Phu St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+84 58 822355"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=M-Sa 08:00-11:00 and 14:00-16:30"],["price=USD2"],["content=This is a scientific museum of Swiss-born Dr. Alexandre Yersin (1863-1943), who arrived in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vietnam"]]}," in 1891 to study infected animals.

A two-dive boat trip with equipment rental and modest lunch can be had for USD45.\n\nCoastal and undersea construction has stirred up a lot of sediment in the area, so under-water visibility is sometimes not great. The area is heavily fished, so fish life is also limited. You wouldn't cross the world just to dive at Nha Trang. But if you always dreamed of getting a scuba certification, Nha Trang is a good place to do it. The shops generally offer good-quality equipment and experienced, certified dive masters. Diving goes on year-round, but in the Oct-Dec windy season, the boat ride can be a bit rough and diving is limited to a few sites in the lee of the islands.\n\nOrganisation of the Nha Trang dive industry is sometimes complex. If you sign up for a trip with shop A, you might find yourself joined with a group and divemaster from shop B, which shares a boat with another group and divemaster from shop C, the boat itself being independently owned. Consolidation is especially active in the off-season, when few if any shops can fill a boat on their own. It's a good illustration of Vietnamese culture, which does not stand on ceremony, and loves a bargain, and is very skilled at making maximum use of resources.

The turn off for Jungle Beach gets you off the busy highway for a more relaxing 20 km stretch of road to Jungle Beach Resort. Just after this turn off for Jungle Beach is the turn off for Doc Let Beach, which is another 13 km away and a similarly more relaxing and scenic road.

At night Nha Trang is extremely rampant for theft and pick pocketing of tourists leaving the bars or just walking around late at night. Travelers should be advised to leave all valuables at their hotel room, including cell phones and cameras which are targeted the most. Unless you are willing to lose it, you shouldn't bring it out to the bars."]]},"\n\nNha Trang generally has a low crime rate, though the risk of petty crime especially late at night is high compared to most other places in Asia. The most common crime is pick pocketing after midnight near the Sailing Club. During the day, it is relatively safe though bag snatching on the beach is no uncommon, so don't take any valuables to the beach. Staying cautious at all times is best. Do not wear too much jewellery, and keep an eye on your belongings. It would be smart to travel in groups when you are out roaming the streets at night. Also, people coming home from the clubs should take a taxi and not a motorbike taxi. Single males walking back to their hotels in the early hours from clubs and bars such as the Sailing Club and Why Not Bar, especially if a little drunk, should beware of ladies approaching, typically in twos or threes, but often with a couple of guys on motorbikes watching closely from a distance ready to be get-away drivers or to get involved if things get nasty. They come over all friendly and touchy-feely, first checking to see what valuables you have and where, then relieve you of them. Often the victim doesn't even know he's been robbed until he gets back to his room or after he wakes up. This is almost becoming a tourist attraction in the sense you can watch this spectacle almost nightly, perhaps helping out a fellow drunken tourist being robbed. Unbelievably, no police are seen, and no hotel or bar security gets involved.\n\nDo not keep money in your passport. If you want your hotel to lock up your money, they will usually be happy to do so in their hotel safe and have procedures for doing that. Passports are kept separate from other valuables as they need access to these for reporting each day your stay to the government. Better than giving the passport to the hotel is handing over a photocopy (personal data page and visa). It is never a good idea to give your passport to anyone other than officials. Never store money in your passport. Keep some money in a different pocket to your wallet\/money belt. No point in displaying it when paying for small purchases.\n\nDrive-by motorcycle theft is fairly common in Nha Trang. Banknotes and wallets have been snatched from tourists' hands.\n\nIf hiring a motorbike, check what coverage your insurance company gives for riding motorbikes in Asia, and it is frequently none.\n\nDo not argue with locals who try to hustle money from you. This includes tourist touts, moto taxis, etc. They can become violent and aggressive easily, often resorting to the use of rocks or even concealed weapons. Although they can be a bit harder to get rid of than in other places, it is best to avoid these people altogether.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\nInternet access can be found in many hotels and through cheap Internet cafes all over town. There are not that many Internet cafes around now as most hotels typically have about 3 Internet computers available for free use by guests. Most hotels and many restaurants and bars also provide free Wi-Fi.\n\nWhen using the telephone at a hotel be sure to check what service provider they use. A Skype phone will cost a few US dollars for a lengthy phone call compared to USD1 per minute by landline.\n\nMobile SIM cards are readily available, mobifone seems the best option for tourists. Their SIM cards cost 50,000 dong or a little more depending where you buy it and come with about 100,000 dong credit for use in the first month. They also provide 3G Internet data packages, e.g., 1.5 Gb for one month costs 120,000 dong.
