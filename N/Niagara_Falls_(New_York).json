The large Canadian falls—with their distinctive curved shape—are also known as the Horseshoe Falls.  They are separated by Goat Island from the American Falls, which are separated from the narrow Bridal Veil Falls by a small island at their south end.\n\nEach side of the falls offers a different perspective, and it is always best to visit both sides to maximize your experience. In contrast to the panoramic view of the falls afforded by the Canadian side, what is seen from Niagara Falls, New York is a heart-pounding, sidelong, close-up look at the rushing water at the moment it tumbles over the precipice. On the American side, the immediate vicinity of the falls is part of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Niagara Falls State Park"]},", the oldest state park in the nation.  The presence of the state park (originally laid out by renowned landscape designer Frederick Law Olmsted) serves to preserve the natural beauty of the area and prevent the kind of commercialization that you'll find on the Canadian side. Visitors looking to experience the falls as a natural wonder will appreciate this.\n\nDuring the Winter season, a lot of maintenance of the falls, tours, and surroundings takes place. Many areas, such as Terrapin Point and Luna Island, are closed due to slippery conditions.
