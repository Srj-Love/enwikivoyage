It has a population of some 32 000 inhabitants and lies alongside the river Weser, an important geographical feature that has influenced its cultural and historical development over the centuries, as it was one of the most important river crossing points between Porta Westfalica and Bremen.  Its name was first being mentioned in 1025 AD as being a part of the Bishopepric of Minden.  The meaning of the name Nienburg can be literally translated as 'Neue Burg' or 'New Fortification' which may have been a reference to neighboring strongholds (for instance Wölpe or Drakenburg).  In 1215 Nienburg belonged to the Graf von Hoya and received its town rights in 1225.  After the Grafschaft (County or land belonging to a count) was divided in 1345, Minden gained 'Residenz' status until the new line, Graf Otto VIII died without issue and the land passed to the Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg who made Nienburg into a Fortification.  \n\nIn the 30 years War, Nienburg was taken on a number of occasions.  In 1623 the Duke Georg of Calenberg collected troops within the town.  In 1625 Nienburg was partially occupied by the forces of Graf von Tilly, one of the Kaisers most successful and ruthless Generals.  During one night, a group of the townsfolk sneaked into Tilly's camp and stole a tent and a Flag.  This group called itself 'Dat Wählige Rott' and this escapade is a tradition reenacted today as part of the annual shooting comptetion.  In the following years Nienburg suffered under occupation, destruction, takeovers, military occupation \/ quartering, and finally disease in the form of the Pest. In 1627 Nienburg was taken over once more by troops of the Kaiser.  After the Peace of Prague in 1635 which finally brought the civil war aspect of the 30 years war to an end, Minden was occupied by Swedish troops, and despite the Westphalian Peace treaty its wasn't until 1650 that Minden was able to restore its fortifications.  \n\nIn 1757 during the 7 Years War Nienburg was occupied by French troops, until forced out a year later by Herzog Ferdinand.  During the Napoleonic Wars, Nienburg was once again taken by the French, becoming an Arrondissement in the 'Department Wesermündung', a part of the French Empire.  The occupation continued until Napoleon's bitter retreat from Russia in 1813. \n\nDuring the industrial revolution in 1847, Nienburg was connected to the Royal Hanover State Railway system, improving communications to the south and north.  \n\nNienburg was brought into line as part of the third Reich in 1933 after its majority SPD (labour) party council was banned by the Nazi Party.  On 9 April 1945 British Troops marched into Nienburg, and the town became the base for the British 30th Corps, a three star command that encompassed the state of Hanover as it was known at the time.  A large number of refugees came to Nienburg in those early post war months mostly from Silesia, and were housed in camps at Langendamm. The British Army continued to have a prescence in Nienburg during the years of the cold war, and the major unit stationed there over more than 40 years was a Divisional Engineer Regiment (21 Engineer Regiment from 1973)up to 1996.  The Royal Engineers were awarded the Freedom of Nienburg on 7th June 1980 in recognition of the close ties between the townsfolk and the soldiers and families from this British Regiment.  \n\nAs part of the area reforms of 1974 Nienburg took on the neighboring areas of Erichshagen-Wölpe, Holtorf, Langendamm and Schäferhof\/Kattriede.  \n\nNienburg whose inhabitants had lived by growing agricultural produce, including chicory as a coffee substitute and by making soap, vinegar, dextrin and mustard, became an industrial town. Its products which included bottles, chemicals, vehicle parts and adhesives, are highly rated and its pearl-catalysts, the remarkable pearls with the hardness and colour of amber enjoy a world-wide reputation, for they are exported to oil refineries all over the world. \n\nNienburg, with its numerous shops, both old and new, and its supermarkets, is a popular shopping-centre. It is worth noting that the town’s image is being shaped by the happy coexistence of old and new. Richness and variety characterise both cultural life and sport. The river and adjoining waters are available for water-sports (in particular rowing) and angling.  \n\nNienburgers enjoy eating well and they like a good strong drink when they play Skat or Doppelkopf (local card games), or get down to a quiet game of skittles, after a hard day's work! Until a few years ago 'Baerentatzen' (bears paws) biscuits were a delicacy in the town. The émigrée family Facompré had brought the secret recipe with them when they came here in 1791 (and this is represented on the towns coat of arms today). Numbered among the favourite dishes here are, Nienburg asparagus with ham from pigs reared in Hoya; green-kale with Braegenwurst (literally 'brain sausage' though the percentage is relatively low), and Sauerkraut with Kasseler (smoked pork). All of these reflect the basic features of prevailing tastes in Lower Saxony.\n\nNienburg is a charming town on the scenic river Weser, with some good places to say and a rich variety of traditional German food.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["A7"]}," Take exit 50-Schwarmstedt for B214 toward Nienburg\/Celle\/Wietze.
