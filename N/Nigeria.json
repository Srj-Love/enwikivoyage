The Yoruba mythology believes that Ile-Ife is the source of the human race and that it predates any other civilization. Another prominent kingdom in south western Nigeria was the Kingdom of Benin whose power lasted between the 15th and 19th century. Their dominance reached as far as the well known city of Eko, later named Lagos by the Portuguese.\n\nIn southeastern Nigeria the Kingdom of Nri of the Igbo people flourished from the controversial date of around the 10th century until 1911 and the city of Nri is considered to be the foundation of Igbo culture.\n\nIn addition, Tiv culture in the North central region of Nigeria dates to 6 B.C.. Some of the famous bronze terracota sculpture heads from this culture have been shown around the world.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Colonial era"]},"\n \nPortuguese explorers were the first Europeans to begin trade in Nigeria, and called the main port Lagos after the Portuguese town of Lagos, in Algarve. This name stuck on with more European trade with the region. The Europeans traded with the ethnicities of the coast and also established a trade in slaves which affected many Nigerian ethnicities. Following the Napoleonic Wars, the British expanded trade with the Nigerian interior.\n\nIn 1885 British claims to a West African sphere of influence received international recognition and in the following year the Royal Niger Company was chartered. In 1900 the company's territory came under the control of the British government, which moved to consolidate its hold over the area of modern Nigeria. On January 1, 1901 Nigeria became a British protectorate (northern and southern protectorates) and part of the British Empire. In 1914 the northern protecorate and the southern protectorate under the colonial rule were merged forming one single entity named \"Nigeria\" (meaning: Niger[river Niger] area. The name \"nigeria\" was given by the wife of the British Governor-General in charge of the country - Sir Lord Lugard.\n \nFollowing World War II, in response to the growth of Nigerian nationalism and demands for independence, successive constitutions legislated by the British Government moved Nigeria toward self-government on a representative and increasingly federal basis. By the middle of the 20th century, the great wave for independence was sweeping across Africa.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Post-independence"]},"\nOn October 1, 1960, Nigeria gained its independence from the United Kingdom. As was the habit of colonialists during that era, no attention was paid to the fact that the \"protectorates\" suddenly and quite chaotically merged hundreds of distinct and autonomous ethnicities, or to the fact that some communities were ripped apart by the sudden construction of boundaries that never existed before. There was never a truly developed sense of singular Nigerian identity. In part, it was this disequilibrium which set the stage in 1966 to several successive military coups. \nThe Northern coup, which was mostly motivated by ethnic and religious reasons, was a bloodbath of both military officers and civilians, especially those of Igbo extraction. The violence against the Igbo increased their desire for autonomy and protection from the military's wrath. By May 1967, the Eastern Region had declared itself an independent state called the Republic of Biafra and the 30 month Nigerian Civil War began. More than one million people died, many of them starving to death.\n\nDuring the oil boom of the 1970s, Nigeria joined OPEC and billions of dollars generated by production in the oil-rich Niger Delta flowed into the coffers of the Nigerian state. However, increasing corruption and graft at all levels of government squandered most of these earnings. Nigeria re-achieved democracy in 1999 and although the elections which brought Obasanjo to power in 1999 and again in 2003 were condemned as unfree and unfair, Nigeria has shown marked improvements in attempts to tackle government corruption and to hasten development. Ethnic violence over the oil producing Niger Delta region and inadequate infrastructures are some of the current issues in the country.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nVaries; equatorial in the south, tropical in the center, arid in the north.

The road systems in Nigeria are relatively poor compared with North American and European countries, but often still passable.  The \"okada\" (motorcycle) is not for the faint-hearted (there used to be no helmets but as a law the rider is required to have two helmets for himself and a passenger) and should only be used for short distance journeys. \"Okadas\" will get you to where you want to go quickly and you will get there in one piece. In Lagos, there are lots of buses and taxis. There are two main types of buses, the molue and the danfo. Most smaller cities have more taxis than buses, and they are quite affordable. \n\nFor travelling from one city to another, you go to the \"motor park\", find the taxi that's going to your destination, and wait until it \"fills up\". The price is fixed, you don't have to negotiate. Some drivers may have a risky driving style however - practically this means that the only rule consistently adhered to (by cars, not necessarily motorcycles), is keeping on the right.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nDriving in Nigeria (especially Lagos) is somewhat unique, vaguely resembling driving in Cairo.  If mastered, you should however be able to cope in most other countries on the planet. Or any other planet.\n\nRoads are bad. Expect potholes of every size. Expect people to drive on the wrong side to avoid potholes or just bad patches of road. Even on the highway. Expect the road to be gone. Expect everything.\n\nGrass or branches on the road means there is a broken down vehicle ahead of you, be careful.\n\nIf you are white,get used to Nigerians shouting at you as you pass by. It will be something like \"Oyibo\", \"MBakara\", \"Bature\" or \"white man\" if you're white. It all means the same, they are just telling you. \n\nSelf-driving for short-term visitors unfamiliar with the roads, especially in Lagos, is by no means advisable and could actually be quite foolish if not dangerous. With crime on the rise, you could easily wander into an area or a road block set by local gangs.  If you choose to rent a car, it will come with a driver familiar with the area and style of driving, which is a much easier and safer option.\n\nIf you as a foreigner wish to drive yourself, it is advisable to stick to the rules, as you will be an easy target for poorly paid police officers looking for somebody to \"fine\" (payable directly to the officer in cash without a ticket or receipt) for the most petty reasons like not indicating your intention of wanting to drive straight.  Should you be pulled over, do not give your license, as you will then lose all bargaining power when negotiating the fine, which could easily be a maximum of all the visible cash you have on you at the time.  Rather carry a copy of the license and hand that over, or show your license through your window.  Also do not let the police get into your car.  They are not really dangerous, but it could get expensive and certainly annoying.\nHowever, if you just don't pay and never get angry, it only costs time. They have no real power over you.\n\nEspecially over weekends and festive times, it is common practice for police, especially in the richer areas of Lagos, to flag you down and wish you happy weekend\/holiday\/Christmas\/Easter\/sunny weather\/trip to work.  In this case, you did nothing wrong and they do not intend to \"fine\" you, but are rather begging for some small money for them.  If you insistently yet politely refuse to give something, they will eventually let you go. Just wish them a nice weekend\/holiday\/etc. too.\n\nIf you work for a big company in Nigeria, you will usually have a company driver to drive you around, thereby avoiding the abovementioned problems to a large extent.  He can arrange a local driver's license for you should the need arise without a driving test or proof of foreign license.\n\nNigeria is not part of the most standard international Road Traffic Convention and as such will require a special International Driving Permit (valid only for driving in Nigeria, Somalia and Iraq) (if you do not want to get the Nigerian license), not the normal one applicable to almost all other countries in the world.\n\nLots of  street sellers surround the car when you get to crossroads in crowded areas. You should not have a problem if you keep the windows and doors locked however. \n\nThe last Saturday of the month is Sanitation Day in Lagos, when the locals clean their premises.  While it is not illegal to be out on the street between 7:00AM-10:00AM, due to the higher than usual presence of police officers and road check points, most Nigerians choose to restrict their movements until after 10:00AM.  Should you be caught at this time, you may be taken away by the police to perform some \"public sanitation\" duty, like mowing lawns, etc.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nArik, Virgin Nigeria and Aero Contractors have good scheduled domestic connections with modern aircraft to most significant destinations at reasonable prices.

That sounds reassuring, but Nigerian English can be surprisingly different. Most Nigerians speak pidgin English which sometimes, due to the addition of local slang and varying dialect, greatly differs from standard English.\n\nFor example, consider American Creoles in the Louisiana region or the over-exaggerated (but well recognized) Jamaican pidgin English. Understanding Nigerian pidgin English may take time for the unaccustomed ear, but it's definitely possible, not to mention exciting as the acquisition of a new language often is. The easiest way to overcome any initial language block is to ask questions. They will not hesitate to ask you to clarify what you mean, or admit that they do not understand an outsider's particular manner of phrasing. Do not assume that a Nigerian's inability to answer you indicates ignorance. Remember: initially, your English is as difficult to understand to them as theirs is to you. Once you both adjust yourselves to a newer cadence of English, the static will clear and mutual understanding will commence.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nNigeria's currency is ",{"type":"'''","value":["naira"]}," (symbol:₦, ISO 4217 code: ",{"type":"'''","value":["NGN"]},"). In August 2012 the rate was €1=NGN214. Banknotes circulate in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1,000 and inflation typically runs in double figures.\n\nIt is advised to cash all your naira back into another currency at the airport before you leave Nigeria.  The rate is irrelevant, as the naira is not worth that much outside Nigeria. Naira bills\/coins may be of interest to currency collectors, but other than that, they will be nothing more than colourful souvenirs of your trip. Banks will change foreign currency to naira, but usually not the other way around, even though you are a foreigner. You would therefore need to use the Bureaux de Change at the International terminal or the new Domestic terminal or street vendors to get foreign currency should you end up with unused naira at the end of your trip. A safe place to change in Victoria Island is in the tourist market of Eco Hotel in Victoria Island (not the hotel reception which will give you rip-off rates).  \nIf the Bureaux de Change at the airport do not want to help or are closed, the car park outside the International terminal is full of street vendors only willing to change money from any major currency.  When dealing with these street vendors, keep the money you are buying fully visible until the deal is finished (i.e. don't put into handbag and later discover it is wrong and then try and bargain) and count carefully with them, as they tend to try and short-change you with a note or two, especially when you change foreign currency into naira (which is a thick bundle of small notes), but with necessary vigilance are generally fine. Street vendors are also plentiful at the main land borders to change naira into CFAs (XOF (Benin and Niger side) or XAF (Cameroon side)) if need be.  XOF and XAF are freely and easily convertible to and from euros at a rate of 655.957 (sometimes with a small commission) when you are in the French countries.\n\nChanging large bills of US dollars or euros will give a better rate with professional money changers, such as on the currency exchange market near Lagos Domestic Airport. This is a walled enclosure with a large number of money changers, which is primarily used by local nationals.\n\nIf you have a VISA card, you can withdraw money from Standard Chartered Bank ATM Machine's in Lagos - Aromire St, off Adeniyi Jones, Ikeja & Ajose Adeogun St in Victoria Island Branch, Abuja and Port Harcourt (in Naira) and ATM Machines of some other banks with \"Visa\" stickers on them, like GT Bank, UBA, Zenith, etc. This will save you a lot of stress carrying large sums of money and it is secured.\n\nOn Abuja and Lagos International Airport money can be withdrawn from ATM machine's. On Lagos International there are several ATM's, several may not function at all times. On Lagos Domestic Terminal there is also a functioning ATM in the domestic terminal on the 1th floor. Usually this a quiet ATM which also is very private and secure.\n\nMasterCard \/ Maestro users can also withdraw Money from ATMs at several branches of Zenith Bank and GT Bank. Some ATM machines of Ecobank, First Bank and Intercontinental Bank also allow for MasterCard \/ Maestro cards. Look for the red ATM sign outside, or ask the on-site security officer at any branch. Also look for Ecobank, they have a branch within the premises of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport.  Visa is however a safer option if you are visiting the French countries around Nigeria as well, as MasterCard\/Maestro is close to useless in these countries.\n\nAlso note that Nigeria is currently on an active drive to become a cash-less society, and as such, more and more hotels, restaurant and shops (all the bigger ones at least) accept major credit cards (VISA being the preferred one - but ask first, there is both \"local VISA\" and \"international VISA\" - and MasterCard).  Diners Club and Amex are almost universally useless in Nigeria.  When paying by card, take the usual precautions (watch how they swipe, don't let the card out of your sight, etc.)\n\nIt is advisable that you know where to buy things in advance of your going out. This can save you unnecessary exposure to touts.

As a general rule, the real price is about half the price that was first asked. The seller may exaggerate the price when he or she thinks that you are a rich tourist ignorant of the real price. After agreeing on a price, don't walk away without buying, this is considered very rude.\n\nShops like supermarket and restaurants will typically charge fixed prices.  Fresh products and Western-style sit-in restaurants are quite expensive, with it not being uncommon to pay $75 for a dinner per person.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nThere are many types of traditional cuisine to enjoy. For example: afang soup, okra soup, owo soup and starch in the Niger Delta, plantain (fried, boiled, roasted), pepper soup, amala, eba, efo, pounded yam (iyan - Yoruba for \"pounded yam\" pronounce \" ee-yarn\" ), jollof rice, ground nut soup, ogbono soup, isi ewu (goat's head stew), egusi soup, suya (kebab), moin moin, ewedu, gbegiri soup (beans soup), edikangikong, ground-rice, puff-puff, chin chin, ikokore, owerri soup (ofe owerri), which is the most expensive African soup in Nigeria. Not to forget 404 pepper soup - it will make you act like \"Oliver Twist.\" You must realise that 404 means \"dog meat.\" and yes, it can only be found in certain parts of the country because in the west it is seen a barbaric.\n\nFor the less adventurous traveller, there are loads of \"foreign\" restaurants in Lagos, e.g. Sky Bar and the grill at Eco Hotel, Churasco's, Lagoon and Fusion all three next to each other (all-you-can-eat Brazilian grill, Indian and Sushi respectively) with a nice view of the lagoon, Piccolo Mondo, Manuella's Residence (great Italian Pizza from Manuella the Italian lady), Bungalow (close to Coschari's BMW in VI) - good sports bar, grill and Sushi, great Sunday buffet at Radisson Blu.  Chocolate Royal is a nice family restaurant with excellent ice cream selection (including ice cream cakes) and pastries in VI.  Inside Chocolate Royal is an Oriental restaurant called Métisse.  Bottles in VI is a grill and Mexican restaurant.  And there are loads more flavours from every corner of the world.  Just Google and ask taxi to take you there.  Outside Lagos and to a lesser extent Abuja, Western food will tend to disappear, with \"Jollof Rice and friend chicken\" being a \"safe\" option if you are not adventurous.\n\nForeign restaurants are expensive and you can prepare for a bill of at least $50 to $75 or even $100 per head for main course, ice cream and one drink per person.  If this is too much, try the Syrian Club in Ikoyi (turn North - away from the water) at the Mobil filling station in Awolowo Road (the night club street) in Ikoyi, continue a few blocks and on your left you will see the Syrian mosque, turn in the gate just after the mosque and the Syrian Club will be on your right on the inside of the premises with nice Lebanese\/Syrian flair at very affordable (for Lagos) prices in an outdoor setting.\n\nIf you are a new expat living in Lagos, do yourself a favour and acquaint yourself early on with the following more expensive, foreign owned, but well worth-it, smaller specialist shops in VI selling all the delicacies and nice imported red meats that foreigners long for in and that Shoprite, Park and Shop and Goodie's (the main supermarkets) may not stock:  1. Deli's on Akin Adesola (the main road leading to Bar Beach), 2. L'Epicérie across the road from Mega Plaza and 3. La Pointe on Kofo Abayomi Street (close to the Brazilian Embassy\/Consulate) and not easy to spot.  Knowing these places will significantly improve your coping ability in the first couple of months.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Nigeria is one of the places where Guinness is brewed outside of Ireland.

Ironically, the only places where you can drink a beer in these states are the police staff bars and the army barracks, because these are institutions under federal law. Beer is available in Kano, in restaurants managed by foreign or Christian people, Chinese restaurants, and\/or French cafes.\n\nFor a real night out, go to the Sabongari area of the old town. Plenty of bars around that stay open till very late. Many do decent food as well. Sabongari is also the place to buy alcoholic drinks and there are plenty stores open late into the night.

It is worth it to organize a trip to whatever institution of learning you are interested in as this would give you a personal perspective on what facilities are available in your school of interest. There is a nationwide, standardized common entrance exam for students wishing to go into secondary schools, after they have completed their primary schooling. To gain admission into the universities (both public and private universities are in every state of the federation including the FCT), a prospective student has to sit for and successfully pass the UME(Universities Matriculation Examination) which is administered by JAMB (Joint Admission and Matriculation Board). Also individual universities regularly screen prospective candidates to make sure they are up to par for university level work.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Work"]},"\nWorking in Nigeria can be a very positive experience. Nigerian organizations tend to operate like small families, taking in newcomers with open arms and avoiding the coolness and sterility that often characterize the Western professional work environment. For instance, don't even think about coming into the office in the morning without greeting each of your colleagues. Even if you don't, be sure that they will go out of their way to greet you and inquire about your well-being.\n\nIt is hard to make generalizations about a country with 140 million inhabitants, but some Nigerians have a work ethic that would put most Westerners to shame. An eight-hour day (not including lunch) seems to be the norm, though it's not uncommon for people to stay late into the night and even come in for a few hours on weekends. Depending on the organization, a foreigner may be able to avoid this, but one should be prepared to work beyond the standard 35-40 hr work week. \n\nThe notion of \"African time\" applies very much to the work environment in Nigeria. Meetings are regularly held later than scheduled and often take longer than necessary. Although Nigerians will unabashedly admit to their habitual tardiness, rarely does one see efforts to correct this behavior.  The higher ones position, the later one may arrive at a meeting. On top of that, starting the meeting before the important people arrive is very rude--a common principle shared with many Western countries. One should note, however, that when dealing with foreign organizations, Nigerians will often make some efforts to correct this behavior, for some Nigerians are aware that their conception of punctuality is not shared by all.\n\nThose who are used to the strict North American conception of political correctness at the office may be shocked by the more liberal inter-sexual relations in the Nigerian workplace. Mild sexual jokes are common in meetings and in the office in general, though usually good natured and harmless. A white person working in an all-Nigerian workplace should also be prepared to frequently be reminded of their skin tone, though never in a nasty way. This can become tiresome, but Nigerians are generally very friendly. They use the term \"Oyibo\" (white man in Yoruba) or \"Bature\" (white man in Hausa) as a form of affection.\n\nThe use of professional titles in written and verbal form is very common in Nigeria. Expect to address your boss as Sir, Doctor, Colonel, etc., and avoid using the first name of a superior unless given permission to do so. Being a foreigner, you will be forgiven for any faux pas, but it is always best to err on the side of caution and politeness.\n\nThe mobile phone (cell phone) is an essential tool for virtually all urban - and most rural - Nigerians. Because of the instability of local networks, many people have two or even three \"handsets\", each on a different network. Anyone doing business in the country for more than a few days should consider having a mobile phone.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["warningbox"],["There have been several kidnappings of foreign oil workers.
