It's the largest multi-day walking event in the world and comes with a range of festivities. Attracting over 42,000 participants and over a million visitors, including many international ones, the event takes place for the 98th time in 2014.

The local hill provide good views over the surrounding valleys and the rivers Rhine and Waal that pass by here. A village grew around the Roman stronghold. In the year 98 it gained Roman city rights. After the Roman empire crumbled, the area became part of the Frankish lands. The town grew as its trade activities via the river Waal flourished. \n\nIn the 12th century, Henry VI, the later Holy Roman Emperor was born in Nijmegen but it was his son, Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, who granted city rights in 1230. Some 17 years later, the city and the surrounding lands were used as collateral for a loan from the Guelders, that would never be repaid. As a result, Nijmegen is part of the province of Gelderland still today.\n\nAs modern warfare rendered traditional fortifications as good as useless, the city walls were finally demolished. The city had already expanded massively by that time, with far too many souls living packed inside the city walls. And it kept developing further. A university was established in 1927 and in 1936 the reportedly largest bride in Europe of that time was constructed for car passage over the river.\n\nIn 1944, the city centre sustained massive damage when it was bombed by the Americans by mistake, as pilots thought they were attacking the German city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kleve"]]},". Shortly after, it was the scene of severe battle during Operation Market Garden. When the city was finally liberated, most of its historic heritage was gone or damaged. Rebuilding efforts and city planning in the following decades included further destruction of some of the remaining structures. The fine collection of monuments today is therefore only a small glimpse of Nijmegen's rich history.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Tourist information"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=VVV Rijk van Nijmegen"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.arnhemnijmegenregion.com\/vvv-rijk-van-nijmegen"],["email="],["address=Keizer Karelplein 32h"],["lat=51.84259"],["long=5.85842"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Tu-F: 09:30-17:30, Sa: 10:00-16:00, closed Su & M"],["price="],["content=The tourist information office (VVV) works closely together with that of the city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Arnhem"]]}," and all the smaller destinations around.
