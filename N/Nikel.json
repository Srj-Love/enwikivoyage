As the town's name hint Nikel owes its existence to the vast quantities of nickel that have been mined nearby since the 1930s. Russian mining giant Norilsk Nickel owns the mines and operates a huge smelter plant just outside the town where a large part of the population finds employment. This smelter also happens to be one of the world's biggest emitters of sulfur dioxide affecting the environment (and people!) living nearby - including those on the other side of the border. Emissions and the future of the Nikel smelter continues to engage both the Norwegian government as well as the general population.\n\nVisa requirements have been eased in the last few years in the border area which has led to a large increase of visitors from Norway, mostly interested in cheap gasoline but in the process driving a small boom economy.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["mapframe"],["69.4083"],["30.2115"],["zoom=14"]]},"\n\nBuses connect with the regional capital ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Murmansk"]]}," up to six times a day taking 3½ hours.
