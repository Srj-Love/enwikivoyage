The White Nile forms the eastern border of the park for c.48 km. Beyond it, on the eastern bank, there is a buffer zone, bounded by the Assua river to the north and by the Juba-Nimule road to the east. The Kayu river flows through the park from the Uganda border to the White Nile. The topography is hilly and most of the park is covered with savanna woodland of Acacia spp., Balanites aegyptiaca and Combretum aculeatum. Riverine woodland, found along permanent and seasonal watercourses, is composed principally of Acacia sieberiana and Borassus aethiopium. The site is contiguous with two IBAs in Uganda; Mount Kei Forest Reserve (UG022) and Mount Otzi Forest Reserve (UG023).\n\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nCan be reached by Swamp Airboat operated by www.bahr-el-jebel-safaris.com.\n",{"type":"*","value":[" At your own you can do: Arriving from Juba just before Nimule there is a sign at your right.
