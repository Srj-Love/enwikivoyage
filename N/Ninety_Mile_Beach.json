It is actually about 58 miles in length. It got its name from the estimate which the early farmers in the area used when bringing their cattle to market. They figured they could drive their livestock 30 miles per day and it would take them three days to make the trip from the top to the bottom of the beach. Thus the ninety mile name.\n\nThe beach is also a road and can be driven, when the tide permits, for its entire length using appropriate 4WD vehicles. Once clear of the village of Ahipara, one can count on one hand the number of man-made structures on the entire length of the beach.\n\nThere is extensive forestry situated beyond and eastward of the primary dune line. This adds to the beauty and mystery of the beach. In addition, a large herd of wild horses, estimated at over 300 head, live in the forest and can oftimes be seen, not only in their forested habitat, but on the beach as well.\n\nClose to its northern end, the shallow Te Paki Stream joins the beach. The stream may be traversed by appropriate vehicles. At the far end of the stream is an extensive and very beautiful sand dune system. Visitors often climb the steep sand hills or toboggan down them.\n\nSome refer to Ninety Mile Beach as the \"mother of all beaches\". Once one experiences it, its easy to see why.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nDaily sightseeing tours are operated by Fullers GreatSights Bay of Islands ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.dolphincruises.co.nz"]}," and include sandboarding on boogieboards down the massive sand dunes at Te Paki Stream, towards the northern end of the Ninety Mile Beach.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Itineraries"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Far Far North"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Ninety Mile Beach, New Zealand"]]}]
