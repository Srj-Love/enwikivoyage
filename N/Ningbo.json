If you've been to other \"ancient towns\" in China, you will know that they run the gamut of being fully functioning towns as just as they were hundreds of years ago, to tourist dumps with nothing but trinket shops and unwashed hordes. This town receives about 300 to 500 tourists a day (according to the locals) and is large enough that you can spend about an hour wandering around. The level of preservation is still very good, although there were a few buildings being rebuilt in the \"old style\". This town strikes a decent balance between having some tourists, while maintaining its role as a functioning village. It seems like they've built up the infrastructure to really push more tourism though, despite relatively few making the trip out, so you might want to check the place out now before it becomes overrun."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Bowling"],["url=http:\/\/www.mandarin-nb.com"],["email="],["address=4F, 2 Wenchang Jie, Zhongshan Xi Lu 中山西路文昌街2号4楼"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+86 0574 8726-8668"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=noon-11:30PM"],["price="],["content=Inside the Mandarin Prosperous Hotel you will find a modern six lane bowling alley."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Orient Golf Country Club"],["url="],["email="],["address=Taowu, Mashan, Wuxi"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+86 0574-8622-8999"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=7,221 Yards, 18 Holes, Par 72"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Lu Han Golf Club"],["url="],["email="],["address=360 Zhongxing Lu 中兴路360号"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+86 0574 8777-7525"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Cheap and easy driving range"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Ningbo Delson Green World Golf Club"],["url=http:\/\/www.delsongolf.net"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+86 0574 8840 1166"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=18-hole golf course with 6 artificial lakes, Par 72, 7200 Yards.

But given the opening hours of the store which are appropriate for caterers and restauranteurs (early in the morning to late at night) its possible that some items are simply sold out and that day time re-stocking activities frustrate customers making their way down aisles. Have no fear for parking - there is plenty of it with a massive car park part of the compound. There are not many immediately obvious places to eat out near Metro. So don't go on an empty stomach or be prepared to snack on some of your purchases. Strictly speaking you will need a Metro card to purchase. But obtaining one is free and easy.
