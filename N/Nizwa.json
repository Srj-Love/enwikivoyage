For centuries it was a seat of conservative Islamic scholarship, and was considered to be so hostile to outsiders that even in the mid-20th century the explorer Wilfred Thesiger was forced to abandon his attempts to visit the city.\n\nIn the 1950s Nizwa revolted against the Sultan of Muscat; this was eventually suppressed with the aid of British forces. Since the 1970s it has quickly modernized, yet managed to retain its traditional character in its newer architecture. Today the city is known for date cultivation, the most highly prized varieties of which are khalas and khumaizi.\n\nNizwa is located at the base of the Hajar Mountains, and can be a good base for day trips into the mountains or nearby wadis. It is now after Muscat the second city most visited by foreigners.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Mapframe"],["22.91903"],["57.53574"],["zoom=14"]]},"\n\nNizwa is about 1 hr 30 min southwest of Muscat on Highway 15.
