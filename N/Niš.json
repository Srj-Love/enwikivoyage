The malls are usually a bit cheaper than small shops and visiting them is advisable if you should need supplies for a longer period of time (food, clothing, stationery, equipment...). Major streets contain numerous signs directing a traveler to one of these (Mercator Center, Tempo, Metro, Interex, Impex Mega Market). \n\nSouvenirs are available in small shops in the Fortress, in the central squares of the city, or in shops near historical locations.\n\nThe local currency is dinar (€1 = approx. 110 dinars). The Serbian law does not allow that you pay in euros, dollars or any other currency in the shops, so, if you use cash, you must convert the money into dinars. Fortunately, this may be done in any bank or exchange office, and there are many in the city center (including some automatic exchange machines in the very core of the city). In addition, a variety of credit cards are now welcome in most city shops. Vendors are legally obliged to provide fiscal stubs after any transaction. In practice, many places such as hotels will accept euro notes (often at a nominal rate of €1=110 dinars) and give change in dinars.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nNiš is a food paradise. It is said that Niš produces the best ",{"type":"<","value":["i",["Burek"]]},", a sort of greasy, phyllo dough pastry filled with cheese or ground meat that is popular throughout the Balkan peninsula. It resembles a cheese pie, but contains more fat and has stronger flavour. Also, by general consent, it is much more delicious.  Some vendors sell other varieties such as apple, spinach or pizza burek (frequently just a combination between the meat and cheese Burek). Traditionally, you eat burek with yoghurt. \n\nThe Shopska salad is another phenomenal, yet simple, dish to be found in Niš.  It consists of chopped up tomato, cucumber, onion, oil, a little salt and a generous topping of a domestic feta-like cheese.  The local feta is usually less sharp than feta typically found in the west by a considerable margin.  Most websites with recipes simply call it a brined sheep cheese and the French are known to make a similar feta. Another local trademark is the 'Urnebes' salad, literally translated as 'chaos' or 'pandemonium' - basically cream cheese in oil mixed with ground peppers, garlic and sometimes sesame. \n\nPljeskavica, sometimes referred to as the \"Balkans Burger,\" is ubiquitous.  Typically it contains a concoction of spiced ground beef, pork and lamb.  It may be served in a bun, pita bread or by itself on a plate depending on where you get one.  It usually is accompanied by onions, a paprika based sauce and in the case of the fast-food-esque vendors you'll have a variety of sauces and toppings to accompany it.\n\nChevapchichi (usually spelt with accented \"c\" instead of \"ch\", i.e. ćevapčići) is similarly made from spiced ground beef, pork and lamb.  The mixture is formed into a 2-to-3 inch long sausage and served with onions and a paprika based sauce.  Sometimes it will be served in a pita bread for easy, \"on-the-go\" consumption.\n\nOther favorites include pizza, of which the Serbs do a splendid job, and various pasta dishes. \n\nFor those who do not wish to experiment too much, there are numerous traditional bakeries and pastry shops, and the inevitable McDonald's on the central city square. \n\nVegetarians had been almost totally neglected in Serbia until recently, but now most restaurants will have some options for them, too. Vegans might encounter more problems, although most are usually solved with the help of kind local restaurant owners. Note the traditional fasting periods, especially in April before Orthodox Easter holidays, when many restaurants offer fish and non-animal food, including some specialties.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nTap water is drinkable in Niš. Locals like to boast that, in addition to Vienna, Niš has the best water in central and southeast Europe. Although this claim can probably be contested, the water from the central supply system is drunk by most residents. More cautious visitors are advised to buy bottled water in any shop: a variety of brands are available, and Serbian mineral waters are very good, especially Knjaz Miloš, Vlasinska Rosa, Mivela and Heba. You can also try Jamnica and Jana which are imported from Croatia.\n\nThere is a throng of cafes in downtown Niš, most of which serve various coffee drinks, beers and liquors.  Some specialty bars serve a more limited scope of beverages. There is also a branch of Costa Coffee on the central square.\n\nLocal wines are usually not the best of quality.

In summer months, even late into the night, you will see people walking through its streets with no fear whatsoever. In winter months, late at night, and in suburban areas, some reasonable caution is warranted. As with any other travel, keep your money, cell phones, travel documents and other valuables in secure places. As a pedestrian, follow regulations, including zebra crossings and green lights, even when you see locals ignoring them, as traffic wardens may jump out of nowhere and fine you.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Emergencies "]},"\nIn case of an emergency, call 192 (police), 193 (fire), 194 (ambulance) or the European standard 112. \n\nIn case of injury or illness, the place to go is the Hitna Pomoc (Emergency Aid Centre) of Nis Clinical Centre. If the urgency is not total, you may ask for help in the state Clinical Centre (follow the white signs with this name in the streets) or any of the numerous small private clinics scattered downtown. Be aware that not all medical facilities are well-stocked or have personnel that speak foreign languages, including English. Cash payment on the spot will almost certainly be required for medical services. Consult the embassy of your country, if possible.\n\nSerbia has a social insurance agreement with most European nations. If you get a form from your local health insurance you can obtain free treatment in the local hospitals. You would first need to go to the national social insurance (RZZO) branch office in Niš to hand in the form and get a another form for the local hospital or health centre. Since this procedure is complicated to complete without Serbian language skills it may be easier to visit a private doctor or polyclinic. Prices are very reasonable by European standards, starting from 10€ for a simple consultation with a PD.\n\nPharmacies are located all over the central city zone. They are marked with green crosses in front of the entrance. Their working hours are 7AM - 9 or even 10PM every day, including weekends. The central pharmacy, located in front of the National Theater building, a 2-minute walk from the central city square, is open 24\/7. Serbia is still very liberal in terms of purchasing medication, so you are allowed to buy practically any basic drugs over the counter (painkillers, fever medication). However, for antibiotics a prescription is now required. Prior consultation with a physician would be a good idea, though.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sofia"]]}," and beyond to the east"],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Buses and trains both available"],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Skopje"]]}],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["content=Buses and trains both available"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Belgrade"]]}],["alt="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions= frequent bus and train service"],["content="]]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bosnia and Herzegovina"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Montenegro"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Croatia"]]}],["lat="],["long="],["directions=can catch a bus"],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kosovska Mitrovica"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kosovo"]]}],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=twice daily  going over Novi Pazar (Serbia)"],["content=Arrive to Mitrovica there should change bus if going to Priština or somewhere else."]]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Priština"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kosovo"]]}],["alt="],["lat="],["long="],["directions= only one direct bus"],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Germany"]]},", Swiss and France"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["content=Companies like Eurolines-Lasta, Touring, Jedinstvo or Niš-Ekspres, have long-distance buses to almost any bigger city."]]}]},"As with most of Europe it is usually recommended that one travels by train for safety, cost and speed.
