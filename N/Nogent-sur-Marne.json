The ride takes approximately 15 minutes from the center of Paris (Les Halles Station).  \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nIf you plan a Journey into Nogent, you may be interested to visit other neighbouring towns. Vincennes is very close and its castle and woods are worth visiting. Neighbouring towns like Joinville and the wealthy Saint-Maur-Des-Fosses are less interesting. There is an interesting housing project in Fontenay-Sous-Bois called \"Val de Fontenay\" which you may visit if you are interested in that kind of architecture. Contrary to similar projects, a visit there is relatively safe. However, be careful and beware that contrary to Nogent or the remaining of Fontenay-Sous-Bois, the Val is a poor neighborhood.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nAbove all Nogent is known for its ",{"type":"'''","value":["guinguettes"]},", restaurants on the Marne, where people in the 1960s loved to dance. Nowadays there are still guinguettes but not as many people dance anymore.\n\nIt is mainly a wealthy residential town and you may find some nice houses if you wander near the Marne River or the neighborhoods near the Woods.  If you go by the woods, don't miss the remains of Nogent's colonial exposition of 1907 (near the tropical gardens). Although the remain are now in Paris proper, the territory was annexed by Paris, and in 1907 it was a part of Nogent. \n\nA landmark and icon of the city is the \"Pavillon Baltard\", an old market which was formerly in Paris. When it was to be demolished in Paris, Nogent's mayor ordered it to be dismanteled, and build back in Nogent. It is nowadays used for TV shows, concerts and other events. \n\nIn Nogent there's a cinema (which used to be a famous cabaret), a lot of renowed schools and an old church which is interesting to visit. There is also a harbour and a swimming pool. \n\nOn a side is the marne and on the other side in the wood called “Le bois de Vincennes”, which is the beginning of Paris proper.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nHave a walk on the Marne or near the Woods if you are fed up with Paris's urban environement ! \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\nThe city is mainly a residential one so don't expect the same nightlife as in Paris. However, some events and festivals are sometimes organized at the pavillon baltard or in the woods so called \"Parc Floral\". However, the city is well connected to other town in the Paris Region so if you booked an hotel there, you should be well positionned to profit from Paris nightlife while sleeping in a calm and quiet environement. \n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["48.8375"],["2.4833"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Île-de-France"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Nogent-sur-Marne"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Nogent-sur-Marne"]]}]
