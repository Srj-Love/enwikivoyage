The trip takes approximately 8 hr and costs 110,000 kip per person. Purchase tickets at the office near the boat landing (near the bridge) from 08:00. The boat won't leave until all seats are filled. Reportedly, this is a minimum of 9 persons. If you're lucky it will leave as scheduled at 11:00. The ticket office reportedly keeps a list of wannabe travellers, so see the list to gauge your chances of departure and ask to be put on the list. Take a packed lunch as the boat will only make a few toilet stops at random places along the river and you can't buy supplies.\n\nAlternatively, you can arrange a private boat. Riverside Eco-lodge will arrange it for 1,500,000 kip for the entire boat, or you can ask around.

Speedboats to Muang Khua costs 1,000,000 kip and take only 2.5 hr. Especially the part north of Muang Ngoi is extremely picturesque and worth visiting\/cruising through. You can do that also with a day cruise from Muang Ngoi in a small boat.\n\nRemember: In Laos even the public transportation is mostly privately-owned and drivers stand in a queue to grab the next job\/drive.
