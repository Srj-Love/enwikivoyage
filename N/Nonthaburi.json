Officially, however, Nonthaburi is one of the five neighbouring provinces of Bangkok. Covering an area of 622 square kilometres and separated into 2 parts by the Chao Phraya River, Nonthaburi is administratively divided into six districts: Mueang Nonthaburi, Pak Kret, Bang Kruai, Bang Yai, Bang Bua Thong and Sai Noi.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nThe history of Nonthaburi dates back 400 years to the era of Ayutthaya Kingdom. Firstly known as Tambon Ban Talad Khwan, and noted for its fertile soil and plentiful water where a lot of orchards nest alongside the Chao Phraya River, this tambon was promoted to Nonthaburi City in 1549 under the reign of King Mahajakrapat.\n\nIn 1665, King Narai the Great had noticed that the river has changed its own route and it might consequently have a negative effect to the city’s security. Hence, the fortifications have been established at the delta of Om River where the city pillar has been built as the symbol of the new foundation of Nonthaburi.\n\nAt the time of Rattanakosin Kingdom, King Mongkut has had Nonthaburi moved to the entrance of Bang Sue Canal in Tambon Ban Talad Khwan where later in the reign of King Chulalongkorn, the city hall has been founded and lasted till 1928. In the same year, King Pokklao has initiated the idea of building a new city hall at Rajawitthayalai Ban Bang Khwan, Tambon Bang Tanowsri on Pracharaj I road alongside the Chao Phraya River which nowadays belongs to the Ministry of Interior Affairs. The building, constructed in a European style, has become a relict of Thailand while the current city hall is situated on Rattanathibet Road.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n#Phibun Songkhram Road, between the foot of Rama VI Bridge and Sri Phon Sawan Theatre intersection\n#Pracharat I Road, between the city hall and Sri Phon Sawan Theatre intersection\n#Tiwanon Road, between Wat Lanna Bun triangle and Patumthani Pier \n#Ngamwongwan Road, between Khae Lai intersection and Kasetsart University intersection\n#Nonthaburi I Road, between the city hall and Tiwanon Road\n#Bang Kruai-Sai Noi Road, between Rama VI Bridge and Amphoe Sai Noi  \n#Krungthep-Nonthaburi Road, between Tao Pun triangle and Wat Lanna Bun triangle\n#Rattanathibet Road, between Khae Lai intersection and Bang Bua Thong-Taling Chan Road\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nSeveral public buses operated by the Bangkok Mass Transit Authority (BMTA) connect Bangkok with Nonthaburi.\n\n#Number 69 (Victory Monument – Sanambin Nam)\n#Number 104 (Victory Monument – Pak Kret) \n#Number 166 (Victory Monument – Pak Kret)\n#Number 63 (Victory Monument-Nonthaburi)            \n#Number 30 (Southern Bus Terminal -Nonthaburi)\n#Number 203 (Sanam Luang - Nonthaburi)\n#Number 33 (Sanam Luang - Pathum Thani)\n#Number 64 (Sanam Luang - Pra Athit - Samsen - Nonthaburi Road)\n#Number 114 (Lam Luk Ka intersection - Nonthaburi)\n#Number 117 (Huai Khwang-Wat Khema)\n#Number 128 (Krungthon Bridge - Bang Yai)\n#Number 32 (Wat Pho - Pak Kret)   \n#Number 51 (Wat Pho - Pak Kret)\n#Number 65 (Tha Tian – Wat Pak Nam)\n#Number 97 (Monks' Hospital - Nonthaburi)\n#Number 522 (Rangsit - Victory Monument)\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By ferry"]},"\nThere are also daily express boats that run along the Chao Phraya River from Wat Ratcha Singh Khon Pier, Amphoe Yanawa and Wat Toei Pier, Amphoe Pak Kret District.
