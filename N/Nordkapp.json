It is the northernmost point in Europe by car. Nordkapp is the northernmost place connected with the international road network.

The rock has had a great variety of names and it was only in the mid 16th century that it was given the present name.\n\nIn 1553 a English commander, Richard Chancellor passed Nordkapp and named the cliff as Nordkapp, the North Cape. From that time, it has been called Nordkapp. At that time it wasn't exactly the center of interest. But only 100 years later, the first \"tourist\" was reported to have climbed up to the plateau. He was an Italian priest called Fransesco Negri. It took him more than two years on foot, by boat, on horseback, on sleighs and on skis. In 1664, finally having reached his destination, he noted in his travel log: \"Here I am now on the North cape, at the extreme tip of Finnmark, really at the end of the world\"\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, a journey to Nordkapp was still an adventure – an expensive one. This is why there were quite a few high-ranking people among the first tourists: Prince Louise Phillippe of Orleans, Oscar the second, King of Norway and Sweden, King Chualalonkorn of Thailand. He got his name and date carved into a rock on the top of the plateau. This rock can be seen in the Panorama hall in front of the souvenir shop. And Emperor Wilhelm the second, of Germany.\n\nIn 1875, London Travel agent Thomas Cook organized the first group travel to Nordkapp for 24 participants. At that time travelling to Nordkapp was very different compared to how it is now. There was no road leading across the island to the plateau. Travellers were taken by rowing boat from Skarsvåg or Gjesvær to Hornvika, just below the north cape. From there they had to climb up the steep and rocky ravine, to reach heigh of plateau. The first modest wooden buildings started to appear to the plateau. One of those was an hut \"Stoppenbrink's Champagne Pavilion.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Honningsvag from ship.JPG"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Honningsvåg."]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nHonningsvåg airport (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["HVG"]]},") has three daily departures from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tromsø"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hammerfest"]]},".
