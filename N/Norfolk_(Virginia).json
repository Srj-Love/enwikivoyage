The world's largest naval base is located here. But it is also known as a major cultural center, with world-class museums, opera, symphony, ballet and a vibrant arts community. In the last ten years or so, downtown area has experienced a major resurgence, with gourmet restaurants, shopping and attractions. \n\nTown Point Park is a waterfront park area right downtown that hosts several festivals and events throughout the year. A new cruise terminal was just built in 2007 making Norfolk one of the top cruise ports in the country. \nGranby Street is the main downtown thoroughfare, lined with restaurants and bars.\n\nGhent is a historic district adjacent to downtown. Filled with historic homes, tree-lined streets and beautiful old churches, it is a good mix of residential and business. Colley Avenue and 21st Street are the main shopping and dining areas, with dozens of locally-owned boutiques, shops, antique stores, restaurants and bars. The Naro theater on Colley Avenue is the region's sole movie theater with indie flicks. \n\nOcean View is Norfolk's beach community, and features relatively uncrowded beaches on the Chesapeake Bay. During the '50s and '60s, Ocean View was in its prime and was a major beach destination for families and sailors. During the following decades, the beach community fell into a bit of a slump, succumbing to crime. The last five years, the city has been turning things around and now Ocean View is on its way to becoming one of the region's most sought after neighborhoods.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Norfolk International Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["ORF"]]},"), 2200 Norview Avenue ",{"type":"''","value":["one mile east of Interstate 64 Exit 279"]},", Phone: 757-857-3351, Fax: 757-857-3265, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.norfolkairport.com"]},".
