Its fertile grounds and the fact that it is situated along the banks of one of Europe's largest rivers that has been used for centuries for transportation purposes have contributed to the early settlement of people in the area. There are still remains of the era of ancient Greece and the Roman Empire all across Moesia. \nLater, when the Slavs and the Proto-Bulgarians settled in the region, they built upon the legacy of their predecessors, utilising the many fortresses, roads and aqueducts, present even today, to their own needs. In the Middle Ages the region was home to the major cities of Bulgarians. During the Renaissance, the cultural and scientific development of Europe was funnelled through Danube to the entire East contributing to the Enlightenment across the Bulgarian lands as a whole.\nIn modern times, after World War Two when Bulgaria fell under the influence of the Soviet block, the North was the gateway to the Soviet partners. Nowadays, however, the region is relatively underdeveloped when compared to other regions in Bulgaria. For tourist this means that, with the exception of larger towns, the region is not very lively. Nevertheless, the countless number of historical artefacts, remains from various epochs, are worth seeing: from ancient fortresses and medieval castles, to renaissance homes and baroque opera houses; from traditional hand-crafts to classical fine arts; the region towns like the ones nicknamed \"Small Vienna\" and \"Second Bulgarian Empire Capital\" are full of culture and history.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\nThe cities in the region vary from student towns filled with historical and cultural entertainments to industrial urban areas.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Arbanassi"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Belogradchik"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chiprovtsi"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lovech"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Montana (Bulgaria)"],["Montana"]]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pleven"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rousse"]]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Svishtov"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Varshets"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vidin"]]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vratsa"]]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Veliko Turnovo"]]}," "]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Arbanassi"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Baba Vida"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Belogradchik fortress"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Magurata"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Sexaginta Prista"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Tsarevets "]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Bulgaria"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["43.26521"],["25.41138"],["zoom=8"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Northern Bulgaria"]]}]
