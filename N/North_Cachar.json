That said, the Hills are a place of breath-taking beauty.  The Dimasa people have a long history in the hills, which were the heartland of their ancient kingdom.  The region also has villages of Zemi Naga, Hrangkhol, Hmar, Kuki, and Biate tribal people.  Each group has unique traditions and a proud culture.  While the isolation of the region has helped preserve these traditions, it also means a lack of development.  \n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nIndigenous languages of the various tribal groups are most common.
