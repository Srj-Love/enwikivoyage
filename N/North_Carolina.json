Booming, diverse cities lie just \"down the road\" from quiet Southern towns where not much has changed since the Civil War.  The state's metro areas, and especially the Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham metros, have seen a rapid influx of migrants since the 1980s, with a significant number coming from the northeast and midwest, and the state's internationally-born population has skyrocketed in recent decades.  These newcomers have added layers of culture and dynamism to the down-home Southern way of life that has defined the state since colonial days.  Because of this, visitors will find no shortage of cultural and culinary wonders throughout the state-- whether in experiencing the native Southern culture, which is very much alive and well, or the multitude of ethnic restaurants, off-Broadway shows, art galleries, and fine dining that have blossomed in recent years.\n\nDespite the ever-evolving metro areas of the state, small towns throughout North Carolina remain deeply rooted in a past that goes back to America' colonial foundlings.  From the shipwrecks of 17th century pirates off the Carolina coast to dramatic Civil War battlefields, North Carolinians are deeply proud of their heritage and place in American history.\n\nEven with this shared heritage, visitors will notice a dramatic difference in food, culture and lifestyle as they travel from east to west in the state.  Travelers spending a leisurely afternoon beneath a Spanish-moss draped live-oak tree along a waterway in WIlmington will feel worlds away from a hiker exploring the most hidden corners of the Smokey mountains.\n\nThat said, throughout the state, even in the heart of downtown Charlotte or Raleigh, the ubiquitous easy-going and well-mannered way-of-life will always remind visitors that they are very much in the heart of the South.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Climate "]},"\nSummers can be warm, especially during July and August, but in general the climate of North Carolina is mild compared to its neighbors in the southeast.  For example, the average July high in Charlotte, and most central NC cities, is 90°F (32°C).  In the mountains of Asheville, the average July high is only 84°F (29°C), and highs below 90°F are also found on the coast.  For travelers coming from warmer climates, summers in North Carolina are quite nice, especially in the mountains.\n\nDuring the summer, high humidity combined with summer temperatures above 90°F may be hazardous for senior citizens and those of ill health.  Between the months of June and August, heat advisories are not uncommon. The good news about the heat is the air and ocean water temperatures, particularly for the Southeast NC beaches, remain comfortable for swimming and beach-going well into September, if not October.\n\nIn general, for travelers coming from cooler climates, the heat and humidity of southern summers can be a shock, making spring and fall much more attractive.  During the Fall season, the Blue Ridge Mountains are a popular destination due to the beauty of the foliage.\n\nIn the winter, the mountains of northwestern North Carolina offer skiing and other winter sports. It should be noted that northwestern North Carolina has a distinct climate even for North Carolina. The area termed \"The High Country\" due to its elevation, has a climate more related to areas of New England and parts of the Upper Midwest, as compared to other areas of the South. This is particularly true in the winter, where the area gets considerably more snow and wintry precipitation than the rest of the state. The area, also, stays, on average, much cooler year round than other parts of the state.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nEnglish, the state's official language, is almost universally spoken. \n\nThe Southern dialect is commonly found in North Carolina and is usually easily understood by most people.  Being in the Northern South or \"Upper South\" the dialect of North Carolina is somewhat different than the stereotypical southern accent, which is often more of the dialect found in the \"Deep South\". The standard dialect in most parts of the state, especially in the Piedmont and Eastern parts of the state borrows from the Virginia Piedmont accent, which is derived from the Virginia Tobacco Planters of the colonial era. The difference may be trivial to the untrained ear, but in some people with thicker accents it may sound a bit strange at first with some words sounding more British than in other parts of the South. The Southern dialect varies within the state, though, with the mountainous western portions having a dialect shared with most areas of the Appalachian Mountains in the South. Due to years of isolation, some residents of parts of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Outer Banks"]]}," speak in a distinct \"brogue\" that in many cases sounds more like British English and Irish than any American dialect. This brogue can be difficult to understand at first, but not impossible to comprehend.\n\nSpanish is spoken by a sizable minority population in some areas, and as a second-language throughout the state.\n\nCherokee is spoken by 15,000 to 20,000 people in western North Carolina, along with a number of other Native American languages.\n\nIn the cities of Charlotte and Raleigh you will also find a wide variety of languages spoken due to these cities' high immigrant populations.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nNorth Carolina borders ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Virginia"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tennessee"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Georgia (state)"],["Georgia"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South Carolina"]]},".

These schools have a tradition of college basketball excellence, and many North Carolinians are very devoted to following the sport.  This statewide passion has helped make the Duke-North Carolina rivalry the most famous in college basketball.  Carolina, NC State and Duke all have historic basketball arenas: Carmichael Auditorium (North Carolina) and Reynolds Coliseum (NC State) both host women's basketball games and other athletic events, but North Carolina men's basketball is played at the Dean E. Smith Center and NC State men's basketball is played at the RBC Center.  Both Duke's men's and women's teams play at Cameron Indoor Stadium, named by Sports Illustrated (7 June 1999) as one of the top sporting venues in the world.  Wake Forest plays at Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Winston-Salem.  While North Carolinians love the drama of the NCAA Tournament, they are also devoted to the annual Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament held in early March.  The Tournament does not affect businesses and schools in the way that it once did (many North Carolinians have fond memories of long work \"breaks\" and lunches or games being shown in classrooms), but do not expect much serious work to get done in a typical North Carolina office or school on ACC Friday!

It's usually eaten hot with butter, or crumbled into something soupy, like more buttermilk, pot liquor from cooked greens, or pinto beans.\n\n:* ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hush puppies"]}," are deep-fried cornmeal dumplings, either round or elongated, sometimes flavored with chopped onion and served alongside barbecue or fried seafood. Restaurants usually serve them with butter, as if you need to make them any oilier. They can be quite addictive, as well as heavy, so don't overdo it! Legend has it that they were named when a cook tossed some to a barking dog who was begging for food.\n\nAlso in the bread category are ",{"type":"'''","value":["biscuits"]},", which are round leavened breads usually made from buttermilk, and are often used as the litmus test for any good Southern cook. They're usually split down the middle and spread with butter and possibly some kind of jam, or used for making breakfast sandwiches.\n\nBecause of its large coastal area, ",{"type":"'''","value":["seafood"]}," is also a popular item on North Carolina menus: fresh fish, shrimp, scallops, clams, oysters and crabs can be found across the state, particularly in the eastern half. Preparation tends to be simple rather than elaborate, emphasizing the fresh taste of the ingredients. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Calabash-style"]}," seafood is popular throughout the state; this is dipped in evaporated milk, then a dry breading mixture, and deep-fried. There's also ",{"type":"'''","value":["catfish"]},", found in rivers throughout the state, usually served dredged in cornmeal and deep-fried.\n\nAround the Winston-Salem area, there's a large ",{"type":"'''","value":["Moravian"]}," settlement which specializes in local delicacies that aren't found elsewhere in the state. Moravian ",{"type":"'''","value":["sugar cookies"]}," are paper-thin and extremely labor-intensive to make (recipes can be found online, for those of curious natures and muscular arms), and available in a wide variety of flavors including ginger, spice, lemon, Key lime, butterscotch, chocolate and black walnut, as well as regular sugar. Moravian ",{"type":"'''","value":["sugar cake"]}," is a leavened cake topped with melted butter and cinnamon sugar. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Lovefeast buns"]}," are tasty potato rolls flavored with mace and citrus peel, a favorite during the holiday season.\n\nA snack which may have originated in North Carolina, and is certainly popular throughout the state, is ",{"type":"'''","value":["cheese straws"]},", crispy baked strips of extruded dough flavored with copious amounts of Cheddar cheese and hot sauce.\n\nPopular throughout the South is ",{"type":"'''","value":["pimiento cheese"]}," (often spelled \"pimento\") — at its simplest, a spreadable mixture of grated sharp cheddar cheese, pimiento strips and mayonnaise. It's usually made into sandwiches, often toasted so that it melts, and topped with lettuce and tomato; but you may also find it as a spread for crackers or celery sticks. It can be found in tubs at the grocery store or in convenience-store sandwiches, but the flavor tends to pale in comparison to homemade.\n\nPerhaps North Carolina's most celebrated food is the addictive yeast-raised ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.krispykreme.com\/ Krispy Kreme doughnut"]}]},", a tradition in Winston-Salem since 1937. These light, fluffy, heavenly-tasting fried confections are now available all over the US and internationally; connoisseurs claim that they're the best doughnuts on the planet. If you're lucky enough to visit a town that has a Krispy Kreme store, you can stop by when the red light is on to watch the fresh, hot doughnuts go through the glazing machine, and buy one or a whole dozen of them before the glaze has even fully set. It's a treat not to be missed, if you're in the state.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nMany areas of North Carolina are increasingly known for their microbreweries.  ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Asheville"]]}," has more ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.exploreasheville.com\/foodtopia\/food-adventures\/asheville-beer\/ microbreweries"]}," per capita than any other city in the nation, with 11 in total.  Recently, major Colorado breweries New Belgium and Oskar Blues have chosen Western North Carolina as their second locations.  In addition to the Western part of the state, the Triangle area of Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill is home to several craft breweries.\n\nNorth Carolina is an up-and-coming area for ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ncwine.org\/ winemaking"]},". The Yadkin Valley American Viticultural Area is a relatively new wine-growing region in the northwestern part of the state. One particular specialty of the state is wine made from Scuppernong grapes, a fragrant variety of Muscadine, which gives it a remarkable flavor.\n\nNot a wine, but named as if it were (owing to its burgundy color), is local cherry-flavored soft drink ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cheerwine.com\/ Cheerwine"]}]},". It's been a North Carolina favorite since 1917, originating in the town of Salisbury. Until recently, it was difficult to find outside of the area, but its popularity has caught on and it's beginning to expand throughout the US.\n\nAnother drink native to North Carolina is Pepsi Cola. It was made by a pharmacist in New Bern named Caleb Bradham who sold it in his pharmacy in the early 1890s. It was first called Brad's Drink but was changed to Pepsi in 1903. \n\nAnd, of course, there's always the ubiquitous Southern ",{"type":"'''","value":["sweet iced tea"]},". As in practically all of the South, sweet tea is the beverage of choice for a lot of people; the stronger and sweeter, the better. \"Iced\" is always assumed (ask for \"hot tea\" if you want it steaming) and \"sweet\" is the default, although people still tend to specify \"sweet tea\" when ordering. Most places do offer \"unsweet\" tea, but remember to ask for it if you want it.\n\nThe alcohol laws of North Carolina prohibit the sale of alcohol after 2AM Monday through Saturday, and from 2AM until noon on Sundays. Beer and wine are available for purchase at most markets, grocery stores and gas stations but keep in mind liquors are only sold at state-run ABC (Alcoholic Beverage Commission) stores, rather than at a traditional liquor store.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nNorth Carolina isn't known for violence and most areas of the state have relatively low crime rates. As with any state, it is best to use common sense whenever visiting an unfamiliar place. In most areas, the greatest safety threats are bad drivers on the highway. Most cities in North Carolina are very safe compared to cities in other southern states and other parts of the country.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\n\nOutside of the major metro areas, North Carolina is generally rural and undeveloped. You should be aware that this makes for dangerous wildlife and plants. If hiking, avoid straying from the marked trail.  There are numerous venomous animals located in North Carolina.  Please use common sense.  Also, during the summer months, thunder storms increase and the potential for dangerous lightning should be acknowledged.\n\nNear the ocean, shark attacks have been on the rise in recent times. Always take precautions while enjoying the beautiful Atlantic ocean.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Respect"]},"\nThe Southern drawl in language is generally charming to most outsiders.  In most cases, mutual respect is expected and southern hospitality is a staple of the area.  This is expressed in a number of ways:  holding doors open for strangers, not honking a car horn unless necessary, and keeping one's voice down when in a crowded room. \n\nAs is common in other parts of the South, North Carolinians typically take offense at being stereotyped as \"hicks\" or \"rednecks\".  While some rural residents might apply such labels to themselves as a matter of humor, it is not expected that outsiders will follow suit.  It is very strongly advised that visitors treat the locals with the same respect that you'd afford to any other group of people, and not attempt to make a joke out of age-old class discrimination.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Virginia"]]}]}," - North Carolina's neighbor to the north is home to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shenandoah National Park"]]},", which offers great scenery along the top of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Appalachian Mountains"]]},".
