This park features the largest whitewater rapids in Florida. Limestone bluffs, towering 80 feet above the banks of the Suwannee River, afford outstanding vistas not found anywhere else in Florida. When the water level on the Suwannee River is between 59 and 61 feet above mean sea level, the Big Shoals rapids earn a Class III Whitewater classification, attracting thrill-seeking canoe and kayak enthusiasts. A smaller set of rapids downstream is called Little Shoals. Over 28 miles of wooded trails provide opportunities for hiking, biking, horseback riding, and wildlife viewing. The Woodpecker Trail, a 3.4 mile long multipurpose paved trail, connects the Little Shoals and Big Shoals entrances to the park. The river offers excellent opportunities for freshwater fishing. A picnic pavilion that seats up to 40 people is available at the Little Shoals entrance."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ocala National Forest"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Osceola National Forest"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Itineraries"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nature Coast"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Northeast Florida"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["North Florida"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:North Central Florida"]]}]
