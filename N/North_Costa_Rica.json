From Los Chiles there are regular buses to Ciudad Quesada. Recently a bridge crossing the Rio San Juan has been built connecting Nicaragua and Costa Rica by land on this side of Lake Nicaragua but as of March 2014 it has not yet been opened to general traffic.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Itineraries"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Costa Rica"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["no Wikipedia link"]]}]
