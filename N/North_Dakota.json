It was settled mainly by farmers of Scandinavian and German descent.  North Dakota's population has scarcely changed since 1915, but its urban-to-rural ratio has changed dramatically over the years.  One-sixth of the people in the state live in Fargo, and that figure is growing all the time. The state's economy is based on its agriculture, food processing, mining, tourism and machinery.\n\nNorth Dakota is the least-visited state in the union, not surprising given its location.  But there is something to be found for those willing to venture into the unknown. North Dakota is living proof that there is much to see and do off the beaten tourist path and in small towns. Outdoor activities abound year round: hiking, biking, camping (tent and RV), boating, fishing, sailing, tubing, birding, photography, cross country skiing, snowmobiling, hunting, archery, and more. If you fancy disc golf, there are fourteen regulation courses in the state. Or you can simply take a scenic drive through hills and lakes, badlands, or plains. Military buffs will enjoy visiting the old frontier forts. Nature lovers can see hundreds of species of birds, animals, fish, and wildflowers. Geological formations of almost every type are here. You can dig for fossils or hunt for unique mineral specimens.\n\nNorth Dakota is a significant state to Native Americans. It holds many holy-sites that are important to Native American History, and Spirituality. It has been reported that many of these holy sites have been abused by tourists. Some reports include tourists using the Native American's holy sites as restrooms. North Dakota is known to be untouched, most of these holy sites are yet to be discovered. When visiting these Native American holy sites, it is recommended to NEVER take an object off the ground especially if it resembles Native American art, these objects are hopefully going to continue being undisturbed in the vast graveyard known as North Dakota.  \n\nFamous North Dakotans include: former CBS newsman Eric Sevareid (Velva, ND), actress Angie Dickinson (Kulm, ND), \"Fever\" singer Peggy Lee (Jamestown, ND), \"bubbling machine\" bandleader Lawrence Welk (Strasburg, ND), and author Louis L'Amour (Jamestown, ND).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nScheduled airline service is available in Bismarck, Devils Lake, Dickinson, Fargo, Grand Forks, Jamestown, Minot, and Williston.\n\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.delta.com Delta Air Lines"]}," offers daily flights to all destinations.\n\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.united.com United Express"]}," serves Bismarck and Fargo. \n\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.allegiantair.com\/ Allegiant Air"]}," serves Bismarck, Fargo, Grand Forks and Minot.\n\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.frontierairlines.com Frontier Airlines"]}," also serve Bismarck and Fargo.\n\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.greatlakesav.com Great Lakes Airlines"]},"  Dickinson and Williston.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nInterstate 94 runs east-west through the southern side of the state.
