Millions of foreign visitors come to check whether its rough image as the city of cannabis and Red Light District is really justified.

But North Holland consists of much more than just Amsterdam. The ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zaanstreek-Waterland"]]}," around it consists of flat green polders with thousands of canals, windmills and farm houses, a landscape considered typical for the country.

They are quite calm and relaxed, though ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zandvoort"]]}," can be crowded on very warm days. Another way to take some time off is in one of its natural parks. The historic towns of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Haarlem"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alkmaar"]]}," are also popular day-trips among tourists, the latter for its typical Dutch cheese market. The ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Holland Peninsula"]]}," is a distinctive area, part of which is known as West-Friesland with its own dialect (West Fries).

Buy a ticket in the main hall, take the escalator below ground floor and wait for your train to arrive. A one-way to Amsterdam costs about 4 euro, to Haarlem 5 euro, to Hilversum 7 euro and to Alkmaar 8 euro.

From ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Belgium"]]},", there is a direct intercity train from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brussels"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Antwerp"]]}," to Amsterdam that takes less than two hours to reach. There's a direct connection from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Paris"]]}," to Amsterdam with Thalys that takes a bit more than three hours. Traveling by international train is generally not cheap, but booking earlier does make it cheaper.\n\nIf you're coming from other provinces in the Netherlands, the easiest way to visit is to use the Netherlands Railway ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ns.nl\/cs\/Satellite\/travellers"]}," service to come over. Generally, it is a reliable, fast and cheap way to get into the province. A one-way trip from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rotterdam"]]}," costs about 14 euro and takes about one hour, while a trip from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["The Hague"]]}," costs about 10 euro and takes about 50 minutes.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nNorth Holland is an important region and is approachable from all surrounding provinces.

Its characteristic architecture and lovely canals (known as ",{"type":"''","value":["grachten"]},") demand some pictures to be taken. But there are a lot more of them in the province — every region of North Holland at least has one town with a historic town centre.\n\nMany visitors to Amsterdam incorporate a day-trip to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alkmaar"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Haarlem"]]},", the largest towns of their respective regions with a historic core.

",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hoorn"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Enkhuizen"]]}," are also beautiful historic towns well worth a visit.\n\nThe nearest fortified town from Amsterdam is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Weesp"]]},", which is just a 14-minute train ride. It has a quiet historic centre on the river Vecht with windmills. From there, it's an easy bicycle ride to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Muiden"]]},", which is home to the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Muiderslot"]},", an amazing 13th-century castle, as well as other mediaeval remains.

In total, it consists of 42 forts about 10 to 15 kilometres from the city centre. It's surrounded by low polder lands, which could easily be flooded in time of war. It was constructed between 1880 and 1920, but the invention of the aeroplane made the forts obsolete almost as soon as they were finished.

",{"type":"'''","value":["Teylers Museum"]}," is the oldest museum of the Netherlands home to a very diverse collection of cultural objects, such as fossils, minerals, scientific instruments, medals, coins and paintings (including several works by Michelangelo and Rembrandt). The ",{"type":"'''","value":["Frans Hals Museum"]}," is home to more than a dozen paintings of the famous painter Frans Hals. There are three other interesting museums in the city, including the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ten Boom Museum"]},", which is about a hiding place for Jews and other underground refugees during World War II.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hoorn"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Enkhuizen"]]}," both lie north of Amsterdam and in the 17th century were port towns used by the Dutch East India Company (VOC).

You can also take a bicycle taxi that brings visitors to any place they request, such as one of the museums.\n\nThe locals like to spend their weekends cycling through the nature of the surrounding areas. If you want to see the typical Dutch polder landscape and picturesque villages, consider a cycling route through ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zaanstreek-Waterland"],["Waterland"]]},". ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hilversum"]]}," is a good starting point for cycling through affluent villages, forests and heath of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gooi en Vechtstreek"]]},".

There are plenty of Indonesian, Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Italian, Surinamese, Mexican and Argentinian restaurants in the city, among others. It is also the best place for Dutch restaurants, as they cannot easily be found elsewhere.
