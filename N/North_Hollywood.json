Go down Tujunga Ave. (Henry's Tacos is on the intersection of Tujunga and Moorpark) and you'll reach Vitello's, the Italian restaurant and the site where Robert Blake's wife was found dead (after he had to go back into the restaurant to retrieve his gun), and Aroma Cafe- a smaller, more cozy version of Starbucks.\n\nAlong Lankershim can be found several gems including, Vicious Hot Dogs, Big Mama's Pizza, Eclectic Cafe, Indie Coffee, and Salomi Indian Restaurant.\n\nNorth of the gentrified \"Arts District\" is a working class neighborhood largely populated by Latinos. Delicious authentic street food can be found along such streets as Vineland (north of Burbank) including numerous taco trucks and bacon-wrapped hot dogs. These are affordable options that are usually open late.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Drink "]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Tonga Hut"]},". 1950's tiki bar on Victory at Coldwater Canyon."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Big Wang's"]},".
