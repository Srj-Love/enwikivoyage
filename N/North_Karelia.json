There are two long distance railroads terminating in Joensuu; one from Helsinki to Lappeenranta and along the border up to Joensuu and another going horizontally through the country. If you are going to Lieksa or Nurmes you can continue by local train from Joensuu. There are also bus connections to cities and towns from other parts of Eastern Finland, most notably from Kuopio and Lappeenranta, as well as buses connecting Helsinki with Joensuu.
