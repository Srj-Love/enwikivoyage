North Kingstown also encompasses the villages of Allenton, Hamilton, Davisville, Quidnessett, Lafayette, Slocum, Belleville and Saunderstown.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThe history of the town dates back to 1637, when theologian Roger Williams established a trading post between two major Native American thoroughfares.  In 1674, “Kings Towne” was founded by the colonial government and included several present-day towns.  Kings Towne was the center of the King Philip's War fought from 1675 to 1676. At the start of the 18th century, settlement increased so quickly that in 1722 the colonial government divided Kings Towne into North and South, with North Kingstown being the area of earliest settlement.  The seaport and colonial fishing village of Wickford was also established in the early 18th century.\n\nThe town's population grew during the second World War, when Quonset Naval Base was in full operation.  During this time, Quonset consisted largely of airplane hangars, barracks and other functional buildings.  After the base ceased to be full-functioning, many of these buildings were converted to house businesses and factories.  Over the past two decades the business park has become more developed and has brought industry to North Kingstown from all over the world.  Through use of its port, Quonset receives automobiles from across the world, including Germany and Japan.  Recently, the Quonset Gateway project has promoted the growth of the area by providing space for local retailers and high-tech industrial and commercial businesses.  To accommodate for these businesses and to improve the area, many of the WWII era-buildings have been destroyed or are currently in the process of being deconstructed.  However, adventurous visitors can still see some of the WWII-era buildings by simply driving or biking around the area.
