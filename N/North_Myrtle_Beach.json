[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.northmyrtlebeachchamber.com\/ North Myrtle Beach"]}]}," is a small town in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South Carolina"]]}," with approximately 15,000 residents.  North Myrtle Beach proudly has two claims to fame.  It is the birthplace of South Carolina's state dance, the shag.  It is also the hometown of Vanna White of \"Wheel of Fortune\" fame.\n\nPrior to incorporation in 1968 North Myrtle Beach consisted of the individual towns of Cherry Grove Beach, Ocean Drive Beach, Crescent Beach, and Windy Hill Beach.  It is part of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Grand Strand"]]},", and usually advertised along with Myrtle Beach on the whole.  Once there however, you'll see that it has a distinctly separate personality of its own.  More laid back than it's \"big sister\" you'll find that it is a close knit community with lots of community involvement, pride and spirit.  There is more of a true family atmosphere and a less transient feel in the area.   \n\nCloser to the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Carolina"]]}," border, commercial and residential development is not quite as advanced yet as Myrtle Beach proper since the city tries to balance that growth with quality of life for their residents.  As desirable available waterfront property is rapidly disappearing however, North Myrtle Beach is also taking advantage of the current real estate market and adding marinas on the Intracoastal Waterway along with upscale housing and resort accommodations to keep up with demand.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nThe major area airport is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Myrtle Beach International"]}," (MYR).  Located about 15 miles south of the North Myrtle Beach border and east of Bypass Hwy. 17, it is served by the following airlines: Delta, Spirit, United, and U.S. Air.  Direct flights may be difficult to find depending on the season, but flying to a major hub such as Atlanta then taking a short hop to the area should not be a problem.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Grand Strand Regional Airport"]}," is actually the closest airport to North Myrtle Beach, and serves mostly chartered or private flights. \n\nFrom Interstate 95, the easiest way to town would be to take the exit for Hwy. 9 in Dillon, SC and continue south towards Myrtle Beach.  Hwy. 9 will then merge with Hwy. 17, so just continue south on Hwy. 17 for the rest of the ride.\n\nVehicle travel will become easier once the direct connection from SC Hwy. 31 (Carolina Bays Parkway) via the Main Street Connector (North Myrtle Beach Connector) is completed, but funding was only approved in June, 2005 and construction has just begun.  Traveling in and out for hurricane evacuations, as well as north and south along the Strand in general will be much easier once the connector is complete.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nTravel around North Myrtle Beach is best done with your own or a rented vehicle.  Although taxi service is available, it can be a bit expensive. Yellow Cab of North Myrtle Beach (843-420-1200) operates in the area.  Livery service is also available for hire.  Be sure to call ahead with your itinerary for reservations, especially when making travel arrangements for a large group.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Ghosts and Legends Theatre"]},", 4818 Hwy 17 S, Barefoot Landing, +1 843 361-2700, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ghostshows.com"]},": Experience the only Myrtle Beach shows that are about Myrtle Beach.
