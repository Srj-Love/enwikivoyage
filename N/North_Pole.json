Unlike the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South Pole"]]},", which is located on the continent of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Antarctica"]]},", the geographic North Pole is covered by nothing but a sheet of shifting ice on the surface of the Arctic Ocean.  There is thus no permanent habitation nor even an official marker for the position, as the ice moves from year to year.  Although it was once an elusive goal that took the lives of many explorers, thanks to modern aviation and other technology, it is now the destination of commercial travel expeditions.\n\nThere is also the ",{"type":"'''","value":["North Magnetic Pole"]},".  One definition is the point on the surface that magnetic compasses point to, following the Earth's geomagnetic field.  Another uses the Earth's more broad magnetosphere (which affects the Aurora Borealis) as a reference.

Some expeditions drop travelers here or somewhere else short of the Pole itself, leaving them to finish on the ice.
