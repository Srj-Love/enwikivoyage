The journey is very beautiful, don't forget to stop your vehicle in between to take snaps. The series of Buddhist white prayers flying from long poles create spectacular sights. \n\nThere are two major towns in North Sikkim except Mangan, the district capital. These are Lachen and Lachung. The road to both these towns are same except for the last 30 km where they bifurcate. At the junction is a small dhaba serving amazing tea, samosas and coconut based sweets. Don't forget to try them out. \n\nBoth Lachen and Lachung are sleepy towns with very few local population. Lachung is more developed than Lachen. A series of hotels with basic facilities have sprung up.
