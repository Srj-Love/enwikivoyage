North Smithfield includes the historic villages of Forestdale, Primrose, Waterford, Branch Village, Union Village, Park Square, and Slatersville. The population was 10,618 at the 2000 census.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 24.7 square miles (64.1 km²), of which, 24.0 square miles (62.3 km²) of it is land and 0.7 square miles (1.8 km²) of it (2.83%) is water.\n\nNorth Smithfield is in a New England upland region; both the Branch and Blackstone Rivers provided much of the power for the early mills in the town.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThere are a number of ways to get in and out if North Smithfield.

Originally settled in the 17th century by British colonists it started out prodominately as a farming community. Located along the Blackstone River, mills were later built along the river. These mills are still standing today, some of them are open to public tours and others have been turned into luxury living communities or offices. \nIf you are into old, historical New England architecture, then consider checking out the historic Slatersville Congregational Church. Built in the early 1800s this historic white colonial church features an old piano, organ and the original pwes and balcony. The church is open for viewing Monday - Friday from 9AM - 12PM and worship is open to all on Sundays from 10-11 with a coffee hour following the service. The service is open to all religions and all people.\n\nThe historic Slatersville Public Library may be of another interest to some. This Public library was also built in the 1800s right on the Blackstone river. Behind the library lies an old bridge as well as remnants of old mill engineering devices.\n\nIf you are into historic school houses, the Forestdale Red School House is also located here. Though this old one room school house is no longer used for educational purposes, it is open to tours.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Indian Burial Grounds"]}," - On the corner of Black Plain & Greenville Rd.
