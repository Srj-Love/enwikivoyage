Though the company closed in 1970, the Herschell Carrousel Factory Museum lives on in the former factory buildings, providing 15,000 visitors annually with exhibits and demonstrations on the history of the Herschell Company and amusement rides in general. An original Allan Herschell carousel from 1916 is the centerpiece of the museum's collection.
