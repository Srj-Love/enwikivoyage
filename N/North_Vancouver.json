Surrounded by mountains and water on three sides, it's the ideal playground for the outdoor-minded. You can wander on miles of hiking trails (or test yourself on Nature's stairmaster), take in steep decents on a mountain bike or skis, kayak a fjord and cross canyons on a suspension bridge. If you're not looking for something that gets the heart going, there are always the stellar views the city affords. Ride the gondola to the top of Grouse Mountain for a view of Vancouver and beyond, stroll along the waterfront by Lonsdale Quay or relax in one of the many coffee shops. And that's one of the great things about North Vancouver — it's close to the sophistication offered by Vancouver but in 30 minutes you can be in the wilderness or a beautiful spot like Deep Cove and forget you're in a metropolitan area of over two million people.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["City and District"],["There are actually ",{"type":"'''''","value":["two"]}," municipalities called North Vancouver: the ",{"type":"''","value":["City of North Vancouver"]}," ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cnv.org"]}," and the ",{"type":"''","value":["District of North Vancouver"]}," ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.dnv.org"]},". The City centers around Lonsdale Ave and is more dense and urban in character. The District is more suburban and single-family homes. The distinction between the two is largely irrelevant for travellers and most locals would have a difficult time telling you exactly where the City ends and the District begins (it's all just \"North Vancouver\"). However, if you get a parking ticket or need to visit one of the city halls, make sure to check which one — City or District — you need to go to."]]},"\n\nThe history and culture of North Vancouver is largely shaped by its geography and climate. Drawing on the frequent rain and temperate climate, the slopes of the Coastal Mountains were forested with massive trees and lush vegetation. The streams and rivers cascading down the mountains were ideal sources of salmon and the forests had abundant wildlife. The first inhabitants of the area, the Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh peoples, had a number of villages and camps on the shores of Burrard Inlet and relied on the rivers and forests for food and resources. \n\nThe same giant trees attracted European settlers, who started arriving in the mid 1800s. Logging became the principle industry and for a stretch of time in the late 1800s, the sale of logs from the Moodyville mill in North Vancouver was one of British Columbia's largest sources of export revenue.  By the early 1900s, most of the old growth forest had been chopped down and the industrial focus switched to shipbuilding. The North Vancouver shipyards were at their peak during World War 2 and the decades immediately following, and are estimated to have built half of Canada's wartime cargo vessels. Much of the old shipyards are gone now, but their story is still told in the Shipyards area close to Lonsdale Quay.\n\nOne thing any visitor to North Vancouver will notice is the mountains rising up behind the city. More than just a beautiful backdrop on a pretty postcard, the mountains are an attraction onto themselves. Grouse Mountain and Mount Seymour became popular in the 1920s and 30s with hikers and skiers. Chalets and cabins were built, followed by rope tows and chair lifts. Development has continued with Mount Seymour now protected as a provincial park while Grouse Mountain has become one of the Vancouver region's top tourist attractions with its views and year-round activities. The mountains were early hot-spots for and helped push snowboarding and mountain biking and remain favorite locations for pro photo shoots. Many people choose to live in North Vancouver today for the easy access it provides to outdoor recreation.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:North Vancouver WV map.png"],["thumb"],["center"],["700px"],["Map of North Vancouver"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nIf you're coming from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vancouver"]]},", you enter North Vancouver by either ",{"type":"'''","value":["Highway 1"]}," (Trans Canada Highway) across the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Second Narrows Bridge"]}," or by ",{"type":"'''","value":["Highway 99"]}," across the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Lion's Gate Bridge"]},".  \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.translink.bc.ca TransLink"]}]}," bus system connects North Vancouver with the rest of the TransLink system in Vancouver and its surrounding suburbs.
