As a general rule of thumb, allowing one hour to travel 70 kilometres should provide for relaxed and comfortable travel and plenty of time to enjoy travel breaks.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southeast Tasmania"]]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Northeast Tasmania"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["East Coast (Tasmania)"],["East Coast"]]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["West Coast Tasmania"],["West Coast"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Tasmania"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:North West Tasmania"]]}]
