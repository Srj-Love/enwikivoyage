To get a sense of that distance, the trip from Adelaide to Perth is close to 2,700 km.

You pass over the Tropic of Capricorn just north of the Minilya roadhouse (near the Lyndon River), as well as through a region with some of the largest iron ore deposits in the world just inland from your route, and some of the oldest rock on the planet.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Prepare"]},"\nIts a great trip and a busy highway, you need to be prepared for long sections between roadhouses, as well as hot long boring sections, good food supplies and water supplies are worth getting at the larger stops like Geraldton and Carnarvon.\n\nAs an itinerary this trip can be spread out in time as long as you can afford, as there are stopping places, and regions that can consume time.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nFrom Perth, travel north along ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Great Northern Highway"]]},", turn left at Brand Highway, and continue through to Geraldton to reach the southern end of North West Coastal Highway. Other routes can be taken to reach Brand Highway near Dongara, such as Wanneroo Road and then Indian Ocean Drive from Perth's north-west, or The Midlands Road from Moora.\n\nFrom the state's north or the Northern Territory, travel along Great Northern Highway to Port Hedland. The northern end of North West Coastal Highway is about 30 kilometres beyond the Port Hedland turnoff.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drive"]},"\nBetween ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Geraldton"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Carnarvon"]]},", the highway passes through remote and dry semi-desert areas. There are no towns along the highway for about 400 km, with several ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Roadhouse (facility)"],["roadhouse"]]},"s being the only settlements. Travellers are advised to bring adequate drinking water as the roadhouses do not provide it for free. On this stretch, a turnoff at the Overlander Roadhouse leads to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shark Bay"]]}," with its world-famous ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Monkey Mia"]]}," via a stretch of road known as ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.sharkbay.wa.gov.au\/world-heritage\/world-heritage-drive\/ World Heritage Drive"]},".\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Carnarvon"]]},", the only town between Geraldton and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Karratha"]]},", marks a change in climate. Bananas and other subtropical fruits are grown here. Unlike the subtropical areas on the east coast, the climate is much drier, but Carnarvon is also notorious as one of Western Australia's windiest locations.\n\nFurther north, the highway passes through desert and becomes very flat. Bridges span many creeks and rivers, which from the distance can be spotted by stands of eucalyptus which grow along their courses towering above the surrounding spinifex and mulga plants. Most of the time these creeks and rivers are dry; however between November and April, the passage of cyclones and other rain bearing depressions can cause the rivers to rise from dry to over 10 metres deep in less than a day.\n\nNear Minilya Roadhouse is the turnoff to the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North West Cape"]]}," area which is home to the tourist destinations of Cape Range National Park, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Coral Bay"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Exmouth (Western Australia)"],["Exmouth"]]},". Exmouth is also home to the US Navy communications base.\n\nFurther north the road goes inland and crosses the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ashburton River (Western Australia)"],["Ashburton River"]]}," near Nanutarra Roadhouse.

The following turnoff leads to the coastal town of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Onslow"]]},". After crossing the Robe River, Fortescue River, and Maitland River, the highway reaches ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Karratha"]]},". Karratha, together with its nearby sister town ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dampier"]]},", is home to the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North West Shelf"]]}," oil & gas project, and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pilbara"],["Pilbara's"]]}," number two iron ore exporting port.

Significant distances separate larger towns such as Geraldton, Carnarvon and Port Hedland with extensive rangeland expanses. The highway provides access to some of the better known tourist destinations in the North West of Western Australia.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nThe highway has long monotonous sections where drivers fall asleep at the wheel - be vigilant in watching other vehicles movememnts and behaviour.  The roadhouses along the route are excellent stops for coffee or stretching the legs, and have sufficient facilities for drivers on the long stages of the route.\n\nIf riding at dawn or dusk expect wildlife that goes to the roadside, and be vigilant at that time for tired truck drivers not paying attention.
