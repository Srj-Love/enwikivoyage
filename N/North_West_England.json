It consists of the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria and Cheshire as well as the conurbations of Greater Manchester and Merseyside. The area consisting of Manchester, Liverpool and Warrington is primarily urban. Lancashire and Cumbria are primarily rural with a few large town and cities, and Cheshire is mainly flat agricultural land. \n\nThe North West shows a wide diversity in people and language: the most common accents and dialects in the region are Scouse (from Liverpool), Lancastrian, Mancunian (also known as Manc) and the Cumberland dialect (Cumbria). There is also North West English, which is a combination of the above mainly spoken outside the accent areas. Most visitors will be hard-pressed to notice significant differences between the dialects but there are many to the trained ear. The people are generally friendly and do welcome tourists. \n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, the main industry in the North West was textiles, and there is still evidence of this (especially in South Lancashire), but today the textile industry has all but disappeared from the region, giving way for the chemical industry (especially in Cheshire and Merseyside), and defence (especially around Barrow-in-Furness). Many big national and international retailers are headquartered in the region.\n\nThe region's weather is mild and wet, with frequent heavy outbreaks of rain. Nearer the west coast, the wind is stronger and can be very bitter. Temperatures on some summer days can reach the mid 20s in degrees Celsius. The best advice is to wear layers (it's very rare to see a North Westerner without a jacket on).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nMost international flights to the region arrive into ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Manchester Airport"]]}," (approx 9 miles from Manchester city centre), where most of the regions key tourist destinations can be reached from the airport railway station, with Manchester Piccadilly about 15 minutes away by train. \n\nThere are also low cost intra-European flights available from ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.liverpoolairport.com\/ Liverpool John Lennon Airport"]}," (approx 7.5 miles from Liverpool city centre) and ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.blackpoolinternational.com\/ Blackpool International"]}," (about 3 miles from Blackpool town centre).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nThe North West can be reached from other regions as follows\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South East England"],["South East"]]}," - M1 then M6"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Midlands (",{"type":"[[","value":[["West Midlands (region)"],["West"]]}," & ",{"type":"[[","value":[["East Midlands"],["East"]]},") - M6"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North East England"],["North East"]]}," - A1 then M62"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Wales"]]}," - A55"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Scotland"]]}," - M74 then M6"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South Wales"]]}," - M48, then M5, then M6"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South West England"],["South West"]]}," - M5 then M6"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yorkshire"]]}," - M62"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nNational Express and Megabus operate long distance coach services to the North West.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\nThe rail backbone of the region is the West Coast Main Line connecting London to Glasgow via the North West, these trains are operated by Virgin Trains. The hub of all other long distance trains is Manchester Piccadilly, from where you can connect to regional trains (either directly or via Manchester Victoria). \n\nLiverpool, while not as well connected as Manchester still gets direct rail links from London, Birmingham, South Yorkshire, East Anglia and the North East.\n\nOther cities with long distance rail links include Warrington, Chester, Wigan, Preston and Carlisle.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\nFerries sail from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Heysham"]]}," near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lancaster (England)"],["Lancaster"]]}," to the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Isle of Man"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Warrenpoint"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Northern Ireland"]]},".

It takes around three hours to travel from north to south and about two hours to travel east to west.  There is a dense network of motorways and dual carriageway roads. However certain parts of the area are very densely populated, so traffic congestion is a common occurrence, especially the rush hours of between 7am and 9am and 4pm and 6pm. Also, as with everywhere else, the motorway frequently undergoes maintenance works and accidents are an almost daily occurrence, so motorways can suffer congestion at any time.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nBus services are useful in rural areas where trains do not run, and for short journeys. They are cheap especially if \"day tickets\" are bought which allow travel all day in an area. There is also a place for buses within the major cities, as buses are fairly frequent. Bus travel can be slow owing to frequent stops and traffic congestion. Long distance coach services are infrequent in the North West apart from on the Liverpool-Manchester-Leeds route. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\nThe North West benefits from a good network of commuter and rural trains, most trains within the region are operated by ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.northernrail.org Northern Rail"]},".

If in or near the Lake District try Cumberland Sausage, Cumberland being a former county which is now part of Cumbria. These peppery sausages are very long and are usually presented in a coil shape. Herdwick lamb from the Cumbrian fells is also particularly tasty.  When in Lancashire, try the eponymous Hot Pot, which is a dish of meat, often lamb or pork served with sliced onions and potatoes and other vegetables.\n\nThe North West is also home to Lancashire and Cheshire Cheese, both have a crumbly feel and mild flavour both of which can hold their own against so-called 'superior' cheeses.\n\nThe coastal regions are a source of great fish and cockles and mussels which can be easily bought from a local chippy or at source in the fishing ports of Morecambe and Heysham. If however you prefer something more filling then there is always the classic fish and chips available in all towns in the North West, which can be eaten with curry sauce, mushy peas or gravy. \n\nDessert and confectionery includes Blackpool rock, Kendal mint cake, Eccles cakes from Manchester, or Chorley cakes. Of particular note is the Cartmel brand of sticky toffee pudding which can be purchased in the Lake District - this is an absolutely delicious must for pudding lovers!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Europe\/United_Kingdom\/England\/Regions\/North_West\/"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["England"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:North West England"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["54.016666666667"],["-2.6333333333333"]]}]
