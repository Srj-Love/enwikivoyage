A geopark is a region with a great geological heritage and various ways by which the geology is explained to the visitor, for instance by visitor centres or geological trails.  There are at present 32 European Geoparks all endorsed by UNESCO.  See the website of the European Geopark Network ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.europeangeoparks.org"]}," for other European Geoparks.\n\nThe North West Highlands Geopark is a geological wonderland: the rocks range from the 3 billion year old Lewisian Gneiss to the Torridonian Sandstone which makes up the spectacular mountains such as Ben More Coigach, Suilven and Quinag.  White quartzite caps many mountains and the largest area of limestone in Scotland occurs in the Geopark.  For geologists, however, the most famous feature is the Moine Thrust, a large geological fault that attests to the vast forces that built the Caledonian Mountain Range, some 400 million years ago.  Much more recently, during the Ice Age, vast glaciers sculpted the mountains and valleys as we see them today.\n\nThe geological history and the way that geological processes shaped the landscape is explained in various visitor centres and road side panels.  The visitor can also learn more on guided walks during the summer months.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe North West Highlands Geopark is between 20 and 50 km north of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ullapool"]]},".

The Visitor Centre is always open.  There is no shop or catering, but there are toilets.  In summertime, there is sometimes a Ranger who can explain more about the geology.

One of the best places is the Handa Island Bird Reserve which in the right time of year can host up to 100.000 breeding seabirds, such as puffins, shags, guillemots and kittiwakes.

Excellent rock climbing can be found on the sea cliffs near Reiff, on the Coigach Peninsula.  Climbs on Stac Pollaidh are also well-known, but probably the best known climbs are on the sea-stacks of Am Buachaille and The Old Man of Stoer. Good climbs on Lewisian Gneiss can be found around Kinlochbervie and Sheigra.  In Strath Dionard there are some good climbs on quartzite.\nNone of the climbing routes have bolts or pegs, so all protection must be placed by the climber.
