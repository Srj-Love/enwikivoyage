Unlike the vast majority of large US cities that have grown through annexation of outlying areas in their central counties and beyond (e.g., Chicago or Columbus), the City of Cleveland proper only encompasses 1\/3 of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cuyahoga County"]]},", which has nearly 60 municipalities. It would be a mistake, frequently made, to consider the City of Cleveland as a point of direct comparison with other major US Cities. NEO simply isn't structured like most US metropolitan regions, in part, because of its rich history of individual centers of industry in the 1800s merging together into one super-metropolis throughout the 1900s.\n\nAlthough Cleveland is the largest city in the region, the other large cities in Northeast Ohio like Akron, Youngstown, Canton, and Warren, all have their own distinct identities. It might not go over well, for example, to tell someone in Akron that their city is \"part of the Cleveland area\", even if it is shown that way in some official tourism campaigns or Census and demographic maps.\n\nNortheast Ohio has been hit hard by the recent economic crisis, and locals may complain about the area among themselves. However, they usually don't take kindly to outsiders trash-talking Ohio. Northeast Ohioans tend to be stubbornly proud of their little corner of the world, as evidenced by the cultlike following of the Browns through losing season after losing season. People in Northeast Ohio would want outsiders to see the better parts of living here, such as the booming food and restaurant scene in Cleveland, beautiful Lake Erie shorelines, parks and outdoor activities, among other things.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cleveland Hopkins International Airport"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["CLE"]},".
