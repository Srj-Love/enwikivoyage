It is comprised of two of Thailand's least populated provinces, Ranong in the north and Phang Nga in the south. In total, the coastline is more than 200 km in length.\n\nPopulation centres are few, and generally small. From the north to the south, the larger settlements are ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ranong"]]}," (in Ranong Province), and Kuraburi, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Takua Pa"]]},", the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Khao Lak"]]}," group of villages, Tablamu, and Thai Muang (in Phang Nga Province).\n\nThis stretch of coastline, particularly the Andaman shore line of Phang Nga Province centred on Khao Lak, was the region hardest hit by the Dec 2004 tsunami. Traces of the devastation are still visible.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Itineraries"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nThe Andaman Sea is famous for its diving opportunities. Many companies based in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Khao Lak"]]}," offer day trips as well as liveaboard trips to the Similan and Surin Islands offshore. A few companies based in Ranong offer 3 to 7 day trips to Myanmar\/Burma.\n\nThe mangrove forests on the coast are alive with wildlife and ideal for a kayak trip. Inland, the jungle is home to many species of animals and birds, made accessible to visitors by virtue of excellent trail systems.\n\nPhang Nga and Ranong Provinces have much to offer those who investigate. Among Thailand's least populated provinces and most heavily forested, these mountainous provinces are lush and green—thanks to abundant rainfall (Ranong Province being the second rainiest place in Thailand)—and being blessed with natural wonders on land and at sea. \n\nThe city of Ranong has the busy atmosphere of a border town and benefits from its Chinese heritage coupled with contemporary Burmese accents. The result is colourful markets, golden-cheeked women in sarongs, food stalls selling unfamiliar delicacies. Visas can easily be renewed within a day, by simply crossing the border to Burma by boat from Ranong. \n\nThe two provinces includes some 100 islands with white sand beaches, unspoiled forests, and refreshing waterfalls, many of which are incorporated in national parks or wildlife sanctuaries.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Khao Sok National Park"]]}," — sleep amid nature in wooden houses"]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Southern Thailand"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["no Wikipedia link"]]}]
