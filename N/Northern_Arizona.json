The region also extends southward along I-17 from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Flagstaff"]]}," toward ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Phoenix"]]},", to include attractions within 20 miles or so of the highway north of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Greater Phoenix"]]},". This definition is arbitrary, as region definitions for this state vary.\n\nThis is a geographically diverse area that contains not only the famous ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Grand Canyon"]]}," but also some mountainous country near Flagstaff and lesser canyon\/mesa terrain to the east and west.  Part of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Navajo Nation"]]}," falls within this region.  There are a number of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United States National Parks"],["national parks and monuments"]]}," here, many of them either clustered around Flagstaff or within Navajo Nation.  Flagstaff makes a good base of operations from which to explore these attractions, most of which do not feature lodging themselves.\n\nThe northernmost part of this region is separated from the rest of it by the Grand Canyon and is known as the \"Arizona Strip\" - no relation to the \"Strip\" in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Las Vegas"]]},", although that city isn't far away as the crow flies.  Getting to the Arizona Strip from elsewhere in northern Arizona can be tricky owing to the obvious logistical difficulties imposed by the Canyon, and as a result, it has acquired a cultural identity that in many regards has more to do with southern ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Utah"]]}," than with the rest of Arizona.  First settled by Mormon pioneers, the area features several areas of interest such as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Pipe Spring National Monument"]},", a onetime Mormon outpost, and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Colorado City"]]},", a polygamist community on the Arizona-Utah border.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nEnglish in the state of Arizona represents a blend of North Midland and South Midland dialects without clear regional differences. Although English is the primary language of Arizona, many primary and secondary Spanish speakers are prevalent due to the state's proximity to Mexico. Much of the regional language and place-names are directly influenced by Spanish and the local Native American languages. With the possible exception of the Navajo word hogan (earthand-timber dwelling), the linguistic influence of Arizona's Yuma, Papago(Tohono O'odham), Pima(Akimel O'odham), Hiaki (Yaqui), Apache, Navajo(Dine), and Hopi tribes is strongly limited to place-names, including Arizona itself, Yuma, Havasu, Tucson, and Oraibi.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nThere is commuter air service to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Flagstaff"]]},", connecting to the major airport at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Phoenix"]]},".

Primary access, however, is by road.  Historic ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Route 66"]]}," follows the route of I-40 along this region's southern edge, with points of interest along the way and reasonably good roads leading north and south.  I-17 connects Flagstaff and Phoenix (and can be a complete zoo on the weekends as Phoenicians get out of town).  Access from the north is distinctly limited by the daunting terrain of the Grand Canyon, but US highway 89 enters from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Utah"]]}," at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Page"]]}," and eventually connects to I-40 near Flagstaff.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:SunsetCrater LavaTree.JPG"],["thumb"],["Tree growing in lava fields, Sunset Crater"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Wupatki_Pueblo.JPG"],["thumb"],["Pueblo ruins, Wupatki"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pipe Spring National Monument"]]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["+1 928"]}," 643-7105, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/pisp"]}," is a site of historical interest near Fredonia.
