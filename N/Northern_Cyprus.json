Citizens of the European Union, the US, Japan and most other industrialized countries get a visitor visa issued free of charge at the border or green line crossing point. Others will need to apply at \"representative offices\" (the TRNC has no embassies outside Turkey) in ",{"type":"'''","value":["London"]}," (29, Bedford Square, London WC1B 3EG, UK.

Tel: +1 212 687 2350). \n\nWhen passing a Green Line checkpoint between the Republic and TRNC or entering via air or sea, TRNC immigration will stamp either a piece of paper (which seems to be the norm at the Green Line) or your passport (which seems to be the norm at air and seaports). You can usually get the officer to stamp the other document if you so wish. As TRNC stamps are no longer a problem for later visits to Greece or Cyprus, at least for EU citizens, you may choose whether to have that souvenir stamp in your passport or not.\n\nOne uncertain source told that you can only get 1-day visit \"VISA\" if you enter Northern Cyprus from Cyprus-side but this may be wrong or may have changed.\n\nBeware that if you are not a European citizen and you enter the island at the north, the officials in the south may deny you the entry, though there have been reports that this rule is not strictly implemented, especially for Canadian and US citizens. For European citizens, entry to both sides constitutes no problem.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nAs the state is not recognised by any international organisation, its ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ercanairportnorthcyprus.com\/ Ercan Airport"]}," is not recognised by the IATA.

It is best to have a travel operator arrange for a taxi from the north to collect you, since Greek Cypriot taxi drivers may not be willing to take tourists to the north. See details on crossing the Green Line below.\n\nAlternatively - to avoid paying a \"travel operator\" - you can walk across the border at Ledra Street. There is a small tourist information \"kiosk\" on the left as soon as you cross.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]}," \nFrequent ferry services operated by ",{"type":"'''","value":["Fergün Shipping"]}," ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.fergun.net\/uk\/index.htm"]}," connect ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kyrenia"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alanya"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Taşucu"]]}," in Turkey. The only car ferry service is via Taşucu, and the fast ferry to and from Alanya only operates in the summer. There are occasional ferries to other destinations in Turkey as well.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nYou can enter northern Cyprus (TRNC) with a rental car from the South at six of the eight(see below) border crossing points. However, you will need to purchase car insurance for the North at the border (€20 for three days €35 for one month); this is due to the fact that the insurance companies and police departments of both sides do not co-operate. See details on crossing the Green Line below.\n\nSince you need to have Turkish Cypriot car insurance to drive in the north (Cypriot (south) car insurance is not acceptable), it is important to know the working hours of insurance people at the border crossing points. Being the busiest crossing point, Agios Dometios\/Kermia\/Metehan crossing point in Nicosia offers the most extended hours. Here, the insurance people work 7 days a week from 08:00 to late at night usually till 24:00. At the rest of the crossing points, insurance people work from 08:00 to 17:00 7 days a week. On the other hand, immigration officers of the north and south work 24 hours a day all year long. So as long as you have Turkish Cypriot car insurance and your passports (IDs are acceptable for EU countries, Schengen Area countries, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Turkey) with you, you can enter north Cyprus (TRNC) any time.\n\nIt should be noted, though, a few of the Cypriot (south) car rental companies can refuse to hire a car if they know that it will be driven to the north. In one reported case (admittedly in 2005 or 2006), a rental company refused to release a pre-booked car because the tourists had a hotel address in north Cyprus.\n\nWhile driving in north, one should also be very careful about stationary speed cameras. The cameras work both ways on single lanes and work only one way on double lanes. There are 4 blue camera signs warning you before each camera and the signs are 100 metres apart. The fines range from €50 to €150 depending on excessive speed.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["On foot"]},"\nYou can cross by foot at Ledra Street in the old town, and at the Ledra Palace crossing point to the west of the old town.

From the EU's point of view, the entire island is a part of its territory and thus, there can be no restrictions on EU citizens (including Cypriots) traveling across the Green Line. \n\nEU citizens may thus now cross the Green Line provided that they have entered Cyprus from a legal point of entry (airport or port declared open by the Republic of Cyprus) Other nationalities may  be arrested and deported by Greek-Cypriot authorities if they entered the island via the north. \n\nThe main crossings between the south and north are:\n",{"type":"*","value":["Astromerits\/Zodhia (by car only) - the westernmost crossing near the town of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Morphou"],["Morphou\/Güzelyurt"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":["Agios Dometios\/Kermia\/Metehan - major road and pedestrian crossing near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nicosia (North)"],["Nicosia"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":["Ledra Palace (pedestrians only) - the oldest crossing, just outside the walls of old ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nicosia (North)"],["Nicosia"]]}," to the west of the city"]},{"type":"*","value":["Ledra Street (pedestrians only) - newest crossing opened on 3 April 2008 along ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nicosia"]]},"'s old shopping street, making it the most central of all crossings."]},{"type":"*","value":["Pergamos\/Beyarmudu"]},{"type":"*","value":["Strovilia near Agios Nikolaos - located at the eastern part of the island near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Famagusta"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus or dolmuş\/shared taxis"]},"\nPublic transport is in a pathetic state in Northern Cyprus. The main cities (Nicosia, Famagusta and Kyrenia) are connected by buses run by the İtimat company, but these services stop after 6 pm. You can check the bus terminals of these cites for other buses, and there are usually buses that run once a day to and from rural areas (though these tend to bring commuters to Nicosia in the morning and leave at night). Bus services within cities are in a better condition, though these stop at late hours as well. Ercan Airport is rather well-connected to the main cities with buses.\n\n\"Dolmuş\" or \"kombos\" are excellent options for budget travelers. These are shared taxis that stop for people who wave them down. The price of travelling between major cities and towns via dolmus (around 4-5 TL) are much lower than taxis, however, there are no schedules. Dolmus run often, and backpackers should be able to locate them in a few minutes. In city centers, there are usually plenty of dolmus options going to many cities, though late hours are still problemmatic.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nThere are many taxi stations in Northern Cyprus, but you won't able to see many taxis around to wave them down, so make sure to get some numbers.

Souvenir shops are available in all major cities, especially at the Kyrenia Harbor and the Arasta region of the walled part of Nicosia. Lefkara lace, originally produced in the Lefkara village which remains in the southern side of the Cyprus, then carried on by the displaced Turkish Cypriots, is now a widespread item to buy. Sele and sesta are traditional items made of straw.\n\nThere is currently one shopping mall in Famagusta, the Lemar AVM, with many international brands.

However, potential buyers should be wary of title disputes, as title insurance is not generally available. Accordingly, it is very important to understand the various types of title deeds available in North Cyprus. See North Cyprus Title Deeds.\n\nAlso be sure and check thoroughly that the property (whether a house or land) intended for purchase in North Cyprus, was not originally (and still legally is according to international law) owned by a Greek Cypriot (prior to the war in 1974 and abandoned as a result).\n\nThere is a risk, if the property was once owned by a Greek Cypriot, that the buyers could face legal action in the Republic of Cyprus and elsewhere in the EU, including the United Kingdom, from where most foreign buyers come from. The buyer could likely be ordered by the (Greek) Cypriot, British or other EU member courts to pay legal fees to their legal Greek Cypriot owner.

In Kyrenia, British retirees often speak of how safe they feel there, and that they can walk down dark streets at any time of night and feel safe. Crimes such as pickpocketing are unheard of, even in the bigger cities and lively areas, such as the Dereboyu quarter of Nicosia.\n\nHowever, there are a few exceptions to this. The walled town of Nicosia, inhabited mostly by Turkish mainlanders, is known as an unsafe place among locals and most refrain from going there apart from the main streets at night. While during daytime it is as safe as anywhere in Northern Cyprus, be careful during the night, especially if going through dark streets, and exercise common sense. Catcalling for female travellers is sometimes encountered when the Turkish mainlanders are involved, though this by no means should cause limitations.

For example, alcohol is frequently consumed by Turkish Cypriots and women dress casually (Headscarves and veils are very rare and are limited to very few deeply religious women and some elderly women). Religion only plays a limited role within the community, for example, with the circumcision of Turkish Cypriot boys at a young age due to religious reasons, as well as with funerals, and occasionally religious weddings by an imam, which is symbolic, as only civil weddings are recognized by the strictly secular Turkish Cypriot state.\n\nHowever secular and liberal the Turkish Cypriots are on  religion, it is extremely rude to insult or mock some of its traditions, and ensure that you do not speak badly of the Islamic religion.
