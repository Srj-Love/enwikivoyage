The mountain has 1,500 acres of lift-served terrain in addition to 19,000 of backcountry terrain served by SnoCats.  Beginner or expert, Brundage offers plenty of choices with a variety of terrain ranging from wide, groomed trails to plunging steeps and powder fields.  Unlike the crowded larger resorts, powder lasts for days on the slopes at Brundage.  Another bonus to Brundage being a bit smaller is their prices -lift tickets range from just $22 to $48 for a full day!\nIn the summer, Brundage offers scenic chair lift rides, concerts, a music festival, and lift-served mountain biking, all at great rates.  \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boise"]]}," — south of the region"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Montana"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Spokane"]]}," — just west of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Coeur d'Alene"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Idaho"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Idaho Panhandle"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["47"],["-116"]]}]
