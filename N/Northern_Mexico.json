But at the same time with some of the more modern cities in the country. Truly this is a very rich and virgin region. Visit Chihuahua or Coahuila and you will be far off the well worn gringo path. In many ways traveling to the north is like traveling through an old Western movie.\nNorthern Mexico is one of the country's most wealthy and modern regions.

The variety of Mexican Spanish spoken in the region distinguishes itself from the rest of the country with its strong intonation and contraction of words. Due to its proximity to the United States, it receives a great deal of influence from English. For example, English words such as troca (truck), lonche (lunch) and bai (bye) are of common usage. \n\nEducation in English is widespread among the middle and upper economical classes of the population, albeit with varied degrees of fluency. Students and business people would the best bet if you need to ask something in English on the street.\n\nNorthern Mexico has the lowest concentration of indigenous communities of all regions in the country. There is no a single indigenous language that surpasses 100,000 speakers. Some of the most significant indigenous languages include Tarahumara, Mayo, Huichol, and Paipai. Please note that is not essential to learn any of these languages unless you go into a very remote area or you want to be immersed in the local culture.

Additionally, the area's sparse population means heavy traffic congestion is seldom an issue (outside of the Monterrey area). As a result, taking the bus or finding a few friends to carpool with are probably the best option for getting around. If you are short on time there are many regional flights between the larger cities. If you have plenty of time buying a horse or bicycle would really allow one to slow down and absorb the region's unique scenery, culture and lifestyle; it could be the travel experience of a lifetime.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nExplore a largely overlooked area that is several times the size of Spain.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Fajitas"]}," - Chicken or meat strips usually marinaded with lemon, salt and Worcester sauce and often served as a burrito filling.
