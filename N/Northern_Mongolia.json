Zanabazar's body was interred here in 1788. At its peak, the monastery had 3,000 monks and 40 temples laid out with symmetrical unity according to exacting design specifications by the Emperor of China. The communists closed the monastery, killed several of the monks, and destroyed 10 of the temples in 1937. Luckily, 26 of the temples survived and have been partially restored through help from UNESCO and the Indian government. Several new stupas and a large statue of Buddha have been added recently to the neighboring hills. As of 2012, about 60 monks live in the monastery."]]}]},{"type":"[[","value":[["image:Amarbayasgalant Khiid 531183590 1e34c7c396 o.jpg"],["thumb"],["Courtyard of Amarbayasgalant"]]},"\n \n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Lake Hövsgöl"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat=51.1"],["long=100.5"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=The 2nd largest lake in the world by volume is one of the most scenic places in Mongolia, with the reindeer herding Tsagaan tribe living along its shores"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nNorthern Mongolia is the easiest region to travel outside of the capital, with most of the cities reached by paved road and rail lines.
