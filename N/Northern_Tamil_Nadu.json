The temple is surrounded by a star shaped path. Walking through this star shaped path is a real divine experience as the mind stays calm and the devotees get to read several messages of truth and righteousness.\nThe main deity in this temple is Goddess Mahalakshmi. More than 400 gold and copper smiths from the Tirupathi Thirumala Devasthanam are said to have worked for six years to craft the Rs. 600-crore golden temple located on 55,000 sq ft of land. The temple appears in its utmost beauty when the lights are illuminated in the evening as the golden temple reflects in the surrounding water.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Itineraries"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Tamil Nadu"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.lordmurugantemples.com Lord Murugan Temples In Tamil Nadu and Travel Guide"]}]},{"type":"{{","value":[["no Wikipedia link"]]}]
