In the rainy season sections may become muddy and bridges may flood or collapse. Inspect any rental vehicle before taking it into the bush. Ensure that the tires -- including the spare -- are not too worn. Two spares are better than one, and a jack and wheel spanner are easily forgotten. Four-wheel drive is mandatory, and if you anticipate any mud, insist on a vehicle with a locking differential. Stick with diesel engines, because petrol (gasoline) is more difficult to find.\nMany Kampala-based drivers are unfamiliar with the north. Although they allow you to rest while traveling and may be helpful in the event of a breakdown, they are likely to be no more knowledgeable about directions than you.\nAny driver's license from your home country will be accepted here. \n",{"type":"===","value":["Rail"]},"\nA rail line once reached from Mombasa to Arua.
