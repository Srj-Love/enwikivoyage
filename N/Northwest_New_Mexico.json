This problem is exacerbated by the fact that cellular phone coverage is spotty owing to distances and terrain.  You may find it difficult to arrange rescue via cell phone if something does happen to you on a river or a trail.  When venturing into the backcountry, it's thus a good idea to carry a little more in the line of emergency gear and supplies than might otherwise be your usual practice.  Extra water is also important, as water sources are few and commonly contaminated.\n\nIt seems incongruous to raise safety issues involving flash floods in an area as dry as this one, but flash floods do claim lives here.  The limited rainfall tends to come in brief but extremely violent thunderstorms that can drop a lot of water in a short time, onto a landscape that the water generally doesn't soak into, owing to desert varnish, caliche, etc.  Use caution when entering gullies and washes, even if there don't seem to be any storms nearby; flash floods can occur far downstream of the storms that create them.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usableregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["New Mexico"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["no Wikipedia link"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["35.9"],["-108.0"],["zoom=8"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Mapmask"],["36.9990,-109.0452"],["37.0000,-108.3796"],["37.0001,-107.4779"],["37.0001,-106.8773"],["35.7072,-106.8952"],["35.5903,-106.7121"],["35.3988,-106.9899"],["34.7783,-107.0193"],["34.7854,-109.0454"],["35.2500,-109.0461"],["35.5464,-109.0465"],["36.0060,-109.0460"],["36.9990,-109.0452"]]}]
