This gives you unlimited freedom to chose your own itinerary.\n\nPicture the scene - you're driving down the highway and you look to your left, you see a vast expanse of wilderness, maybe a picturesque sunset and even a herd of caibou going about their business. You look to the right and a black bear is peeping out from behind trees. With uninterrupted views of the wide open space and wildlife, you will be alert to all the new sights and sounds until you come across a sleepy little community that offers a camping ground with small restaurant of home cooked delights and a welcoming atmosphere.\n\nCar hire is a good resource to make the most of in the Northwest Territories. Reliable and cost effective, car hire companies will be able to advise you of the best routes to spot wildlife and the best routes to take you from waterfall to river to lake.\n\nAnother of the best ways to travel around the Northwest Territories is by plane, due to the airports dotting the landscape, as well as the lack of roads and rails throughout many parts of the Northwest Territories. (Indeed, passenger rail service has yet to be extended to the Territories.) Yellowknife essentially began partially through the efforts of bush pilots, and float planes can presumably land on the territories' many lakes (they are known to land in Yellowknife Bay). Airline service can be had to Yellowknife, Fort Good Hope, Fort Liard, Fort Simpson, Fort Smith, Hay River, Inuvik, Norman Wells, and other communities, and bush pilots presumably reach further.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\t \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\t \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\t \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\t \n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["64.2667"],["-119.1833"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["North (Canada)"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Northwest Territories"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Northwest Territories"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North America\/Canada\/Northwest Territories\/"]]}]
