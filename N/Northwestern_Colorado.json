It is fairly evenly divided between some of the highest, snow-covered peaks in the Rockies and the  beginning of the sandstone canyon and mesa country that is typical of the high-desert Colorado Plateau. The two biggest geologic features in Northwestern Colorado are the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Western Slope"]}," of the Continental Divide and the mighty Colorado River, fed by the mountain snow of the Rockies and eventually carving out the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Grand Canyon"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Arizona"]]},". \n\nThe mountains are still growing, thrust upwards by a subducting tectonic plate that scientists hypothesize is situated at an odd angle. It explains why Northwestern Colorado is curiously free of any volcanoes similar to the Cascades in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Washington (state)"],["Washington"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oregon"]]},". (Although there has been volcanic activity in the past, and Northwestern Colorado is dotted with geothermal pools in places like Steamboat Springs and Glenwood Springs). Northwestern Colorado boasts Mount Elbert near Aspen. It rises 14,433 ft (4268m) above sea level and is the highest mountain in the entire Rocky Mountain range.  \n\nA geological formation characteristic of the mesa portion of the region are the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bookcliffs"]}," that are shown to good advantage around Grand Junction.  A legacy of this geology is that the region is famous for its Jurassic-era fossils, found throughout the Morrison Formation.

Northwestern Colorado is a region of both small, struggling towns and high-end ski resorts (some of the richest and most expensive in the world). The ski resorts are a playground for jet-setting millionaires and billionaires, with multimillion dollar mansions and high costs of living.  Outside of these pockets of excess are large rural areas, home to ranches and orchards. Northwestern Colorado is also where ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Colorado's Wine Country"]]}," is located, the state's answer to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Napa"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sonoma"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["California"]]},". Sizable portions of Northwestern Colorado are public lands owned by either the federal government or the state. So there are plenty of opportunities for hiking, camping, fishing, hunting, mountain biking, rafting and other forms of recreation. \n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Rafting Yampa River, Dinosaur National Monument Colorado.jpg"],["thumb"],["170px"],["Rafting on the Yampa River at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dinosaur National Monument"]]}," near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Craig"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nBetween 250 and 1300 AD, the Fremont people were the area’s first inhabitants. Their culture can still be glimpsed today in the many petroglyphs and pictographs they created on canyon walls in the mesa portion of the region. Circa 1500, the Ute nation moved into Northwestern Colorado. \n\nWith the conquest of the Aztec Empire in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Central America"]]}," in 1521, the Spanish formed the Viceroyalty of New Spain and claimed a large part of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North America"]]}," for themselves, including a nebulous region around Northwestern Colorado. The borders were not firmly fixed on a map, and the Spanish only managed to settle as far as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South Central Colorado"]]},". \n\nDuring the 19th century, the area was very much in dispute with a young nation, the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United States of America"],["United States"]]},". After the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, the U.S. claimed all the land south and west of the Arkansas River. Spain declared a large trade zone around its colony of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Mexico"],["Santa Fé de Nuevo Méjico"]]},", a claim the U.S. challenged. In 1806, Zebulon Pike led a U.S. Army expedition into the area, \"discovering\" Pike's Peak in the process, but Pike never reached as far as Northwestern Colorado. A contingent of Spanish cavalry apprehended and arrested the Pike expedition in South Central Colorado, eventually expelling them from New Spain. The U.S. relinquished its claim on the region as part of the purchase of Florida from Spain with the Adams-Onís Treaty of 1819. \n\nIn 1821, the Viceroyalty of New Spain successfully revolted, splitting with the Spanish crown. Northwestern Colorado may have become part of Alta California, a province in the new nation of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mexico"]]},". \n\nHoping to develop the area, Mexican officials opened the land up to mountain men, trappers and traders. Between 1821 and 1840, explorer Antoine Robidoux ventured through the region in search of beaver pelts. With this influx of adventurers and speculators came many of the men who would later lead U.S. Army expeditions and Government Surveying parties through the area: Kit Carson, \"Pathfinder\" John Charles Fremont and Captain John Gunnison.\n\nIn 1846, the U.S. Army invaded and defeated Mexico in the Mexican-American War. With the Treaty of Guadalupe y Hidalgo, the U.S. gained control of Northwestern Colorado, as well as California, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nevada"]]},", Utah, and portions of Arizona, New Mexico and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wyoming"]]},".\n\nIn 1849, the Mormons established the Provisional State of Deseret, which included parts of Northwestern Colorado, a claim the U.S. refused to recognize. For the next 20 years, the Mormons refused to settle east of the north-south running Green River.\n\nWhile the U.S. was busy expanding its territory, the Utes were fighting a rear guard action, with intermittent settler encroachments on their lands. Friction between the Utes and whites over resources was inevitable. In 1868, the U.S. Government and the Ute Indians signed a treaty that designated Northwestern Colorado as part of the Ute reservation. But the area's rivers offered both a reliable source of water and arable land. This was compounded by the discovery of gold and silver in the San Juan Mountains to the south. There was also a missionary spirit amongst the whites, who saw it as a God-driven destiny to convert the nomadic Utes to Christianity and an agrarian way of life.  These factors proved to be too great for the settlers to resist. \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Meadow Vole Arapaho National Forest Colorado.JPG"],["thumb"],["210px"],["A meadow vole clears clods of dirt from its burrow in the Arapaho National Forest."]]},"\nDetermined to turn them into farmers, the head of the government's Indian Agency, Nathan Cook Meeker, approached the Utes with a mixture of arrogance and hostility. He plowed up a Ute horse-racing track to plant a field, and later engaged in a fist fight with the owner of the race track. In 1879, Meeker telegraphed for military assistance, and the Federal government responded with around 200 soldiers to police the area. The situation was handled with mutual mistrust on both sides, and several skirmishes occurred. The crisis culminated with the Utes killing several whites at the Indian Agency (including Meeker) and launching the so-called Ute War. Initially successful, the Utes were forcibly relocated to Utah, and Southwestern Colorado, near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cortez"]]},". \n\nThe Uncompahgre Reservation was opened to settlers in the fall of 1881. Settlers poured into the area. Towns like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Paonia"]]},", Grand Junction, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Meeker"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Craig"]]}," were rapidly established. For the next 80 years, farming and ranching were the staples of the region's economy. Mining towns like Aspen, Breckenridge and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Leadville"]]}," capitalized on the silver and gold bonanzas.\n\nPost World War Two ushered in an area of unprecedented prosperity for Northwestern Colorado, with the founding of area's modern ski resorts. The second half of the 20th century witnessed the birth of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Snowmass Village"]]},", Vail, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beaver Creek"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Copper Mountain"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Arapahoe Basin"]]},", Vail, and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Keystone (Colorado)"],["Keystone"]]},".
