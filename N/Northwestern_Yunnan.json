Three rivers — the Nujiang (Salween), Lancang (Mekong) and Jinshan (Yangtze) — flow in parallel, separated by snow capped mountains. Culturally the region is a transition zone between the Sinic civilization to the east, Tibetan to the west and numerous minorities to the south. Historically, here lies the Tea Horse Road, a trans-Himalayan trade network between the tea planters of Puer and the horse herders of Tibet. Narrow paths carved into the cliff faces hanging precariously above the raging river are all that the horse caravans had to go on. Winding through villages across vistas, these ancient footpaths provide endless trekking opportunities.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Itineraries"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Yunnan"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["no Wikipedia link"]]}]
