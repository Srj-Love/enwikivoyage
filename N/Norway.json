In the following period, Norwegians settled in many places, such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Iceland"]]},", the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Faroe Islands"]]}," and parts of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Scotland"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ireland"]]},", where they founded ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dublin"]]},". In the beginning of the 14th century, Norway and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sweden"]]}," were unified as the Norwegian king was also elected king of Sweden. At the end of the century, the two countries and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Denmark"]]}," were unified in the so-called Kalmar Union.\n\nSweden broke out of the union in 1521. Norway remained in union with Denmark until 1814. Only a few months after the declaration of independence, Norway entered into union with Sweden, though it must be noted that this union with Sweden allowed Norway to keep a great deal of independence.\n\nThe union with Sweden lasted until 1905, which is considered the beginning of modern Norway. From 1940 until 1945, Norway was occupied by German forces during World War 2.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Geography"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Svaberg Mærrapanna (bilde 03).jpg"],["thumb"],["Typical polished, coastal cliffs"]]},"\nNorway sits on a large peninsula shared with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sweden"]]}," in the north of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Europe"]]},". In the north, it also borders ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Finland"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russia"]]},". Some 5 million inhabitants share an area about the size of Germany and larger than Britain. Norway is primarily a very long country - driving from the most southern to the most northern cities equals the distance from Hamburg to Malaga (and through much more rugged terrain). Norway's coastline is also one of the longest in the world - if islands and fjords are included the coastline has been calculated as 50,000 to 100,000 km. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nordland"]]}," county alone has a longer coastline than the entire United Kingdom when fjords and islands are included.\n\nNorway is well known for its amazing and varied scenery. The famous ",{"type":"'''","value":["fjords"]}," are long narrow inlets of the ocean, flanked on either side by tall mountains where the sea penetrates far inland. Norway's endless coastline also includes countless islands of all sizes - there are more than 200,000 identified islands along Norway's coast (only surpassed by Greece). The many islands and skerries shelter the coast from the rough Atlantic such that ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hurtigruten"]]}," and other ships can travel long stretches on calm waters. There are more than 450,000 lakes throughout Norway, even inside the city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oslo"]]}," there are several hundred lakes. The vast majority of the land (about 95 %) is a rocky wilderness and forests, and thus Norway has large, completely unpopulated areas, many of which have been protected as national parks. Also outside the national parks, much of the land is largely unspoiled nature - there is in fact no need to visit a national park to experience wilderness and great landscapes. Roads and railways as well as ordinary ferries offer easy access to great panoramas. There are few sandy beaches along Norway's endless shores, shores are typically rocky, steep cliffs or gentle polished slabs of rock.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Mardalsfossen.jpg"],["thumb"],["Water in all forms dominates Norwegian landscape and economy."]]},"\nNorway's highest point is Galdhøpiggen, 2,469 m (8,100 ft) in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jotunheimen"]]}," region that lies midway between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oslo"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Trondheim"]]},", but away from the coast. In the far north (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Finnmark"]]},"), there are relatively flat open spaces. Several of the world's greatest ",{"type":"'''","value":["waterfalls"]}," are in Norway, particularly in the western fjords and the mountain region. While there are ",{"type":"'''","value":["mountains"]}," all over Norway, some major mountain areas define Norway's main regions. The north-south line of mountain areas (notably ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hardangervidda"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jotunheimen"]]},") are major barriers and separates West Norway from East Norway. Similarly the wide ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dovrefjell"]]}," separates Middle Norway (Trøndelag) from East Norway. Norway also includes the nearly unpopulated ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Svalbard"]]}," archipelago far from the mainland, on the edge of arctic ice shelf.\n\nThe long rugged coast, fjords, countless lakes, tall waterfalls and pretty rivers means that ",{"type":"'''","value":["water"]}," is the one thing that most characterizes Norway.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["People"]},"\n\nNorway is one of Europe's most sparsely populated countries.

Most of the population are Norwegians. The indigenous Sami people traditionally inhabit the northern part of Norway, that along with parts of Sweden, Finland and Russia outlines an area known as ",{"type":"''","value":["Sapmi"]}," (or ",{"type":"''","value":["Sameland"]},"). Other recognized minorities are the Kven people, Jews, Forest Finns, and Norwegian Romani Travellers. In recent years, immigration, in particular from the European Union, has increased greatly.\n\nNorway is formally a Christian country with a dominant Lutheran majority of around 80%, however many Norwegians do not attend church.\n\nNorway has become rather liberal in moral issues and thus more similar to southern neighbors like Denmark and the Netherlands. Homosexuality is accepted by most people and recently (2008) same-sex marriage was given the same legal status as traditional marriage. For instance, a previous male minister of finance and prominent figure in the conservative party is in partnership with a prominent male business manager. With that said, some parts along the southern and southwestern coast are fairly conservative, especially in the more rural areas.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Economy and politics"]},"\n\nNorway's primary income is the oil and gas industry in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Sea"]]}," which constitutes 20 per cent of the total production ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ssb.no\/norge_en\/sekundaer_en\/"]},". It also has several other natural resources such as hydro-electric power, wood, fish and minerals, some manufacturing, and a healthy technology sector. Politically, it is dominated by a widespread and continued support for the ",{"type":"''","value":["Scandinavian model"]},", which means high taxes and high government spending to support free schools, free healthcare, an efficient welfare system and many other benefits. As a result the unemployment rate in Norway is extremely low (about 2 percent).\n\nThe Norwegian people have rejected membership in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["European Union"]]}," (EU) in two independent popular votes in 1972 and 1994, both times just by a few percent, after being vetoed out of membership by France in the 50s and 60s. However, being a member state of the European Economic Area and part of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Europe#Schengen_Agreement"],["Schengen agreement"]]},", Norway is closely connected to the EU, and integrated as a full member in most economic matters, as well as in customs and immigration matters. This is of great economic importance to Norway. \n\nAs one of the richest countries in the world and with a strong currency, most visitors should be prepared for greater expenses than at home. In addition, Norway has a very compressed wage structure which means that even the typical low skill work is relatively well paid. For the same reason, firms try to keep the number of staff as low as possible, even for low skill service work. On the other hand, many attractions in Norway are free of charge, most notably the landscape and nature itself. Furthermore, you don't have to spend much money on accommodation if you're prepared to sleep in a tent or under the open sky. According to the Norwegian ",{"type":"[[","value":[["right to access"]]},", you may stay for up to two nights in one spot in uncultivated land if you keep away from houses and other buildings and out of the way of other people, provided that you ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Leave-no-trace camping"],["leave no trace"]]},".

The length of the winter and amount of snow varies considerably. In the north there is more snow and winters are dark; on the southern and western coast, winters are moderate and rainy.

Phone reservations normally incur a 50 NOK fee per train ticket bought.\n\nFor long-distance trains and night trains, seat reservation is mandatory, but usually can be done on short notice, e.g., at a train station, since the trains are rarely fully booked. Generally, the trains are most crowded at the beginning and end of the weekend, and that means Friday and Sunday evening. Shortly before and at the end of major holidays like Christmas\/New Year and Easter, trains are usually very busy. If you try booking for these days at a late time, you may find all the cheap tickets sold out. Furthermore, the seat you reserve may be among the least desirable, that is, facing backwards, without recline, and facing towards and sharing the legroom with other passengers.\n\nNight trains operate Oslo - Bergen, Kristiansand, Bergen, Trondheim and Bodø. With a regular ticket, you will get an ordinary seat, blanket and earplugs. Sleeping compartments are available for an extra of kr. 750.

In some trains there is even free Internet access via wifi; one just needs to register (giving any 8-digit number as 'phone number').\n\nUnlike much of Continental Europe, Norway does not have a high speed rail system, except for the route between Oslo and its airport. Attempts at implementing high speed trains are underway, but has failed so far. Therefore, a journey between the two largest cities, Bergen and Oslo, takes as much as six and a half to seven and a half hours.\n\nIn eastern Norway, where cities are closer together, there are several people who make a daily commute, and hence many of these cities have more frequent train service with hourly departures much of the day.

Reservations are usually not needed, drive to the ferry quay and wait in line until the ferry docks. On main roads tourists typically don't have to worry about timetables as there are frequent departures. Note however that most ferries don't run after midnight or they run only every second hour on main crossings.\n\nStretches with lots of ferries are desirable when bicycling, as the ferries are cheap for bicyclists and offer an often well-deserved break with a great view.

Norwegian roads have varying quality, but all public roads have asphalt. Most roads are two-lane undivided, there is a limited motorway network around Oslo. General speed limit is 80 kmh and speed is often slower due to road conditions. Driving in winter require special equipment, snow and ice experience is highly recommended prior to winter trip. Some of the scenic mountain passes, notably at Geiranger, Trollstigen and Nordkapp (North Cape), are closed during winter.\n\nDriving is generally easy as traffic is calm, and most drivers are disciplined and law abiding, although moderate speeding is common on highways. However, some city centers (such as Bergen and Oslo) may be confusing to navigate for the first time visitor due to many one-way streets. Traffic is generally light except for city centers and a handful of stretches on main roads (notably E18 near Oslo). Near or inside Oslo the E18, E6 and ringroads can get congested during morning and afternoon rush, as well as during weekend rush (friday afternoon) out of Oslo. Gas is expensive, starting at around kr. 14.50 per litre (approx. USD 9.30 per gallon). Manual transmission is regarded as standard in Norway and is found in most private cars. Renting a car is very expensive, but can be essential for easy access to some of the more rural areas, although most areas have a good reliable bus service.\n\nSome rules to note\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Headlights are mandatory even during daylight."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Off-roading is generally forbidden.

There are few bicycle paths, and most of the time cyclists have to share narrow roads with heavy transport. Attitudes to cyclists vary. While some drivers show respect, slowing down and giving cyclists a wide berth, others show hostility, driving far too close and at far too high a speed, when passing. Cycling, as a sport, is becoming increasingly popular in Norway, especially since the success of Norwegian cyclists like Thor Hushovd. Attitudes to bicycle tourists vary, but in general is positive. Hostels and camping sites are generally a good place to meet people with similar interests. Norwegians themselves prefer to ride on well equipped, often expensive, bicycles. Good bicycle shops can be found in most cities.\n\nYou'll find quite a number of travel diaries online. Only few designated cycle paths exist, mostly in the big cities, and they are not fully interconnected. Except for densely populated areas, they can mostly be ignored. While speed limits are relatively low and the vast majority of drivers are responsible and patient, Norway also has its share of speeders and road hogs. At places where a highway is built, the old road is often re-designated as a cycle route. \n\nIt is important for cyclists to be seen. The use of highly reflective safety vests, along with flashing lights on the bicycle, is encouraged to help prevent accidents.  \n\nIn most of Norway, cycling can be physically challenging, due to steep climbs and strong winds. Your equipment should be lightweight and aerodynamic. You will need a wide range of gears: a ratio of 39-27 for a strong cyclist without luggage or even 22-32 for a normal cyclist with luggage is necessary on many slopes. Your brakes should be of high quality and you'll need spare brake pads when doing a trip of more than a few days. Lights are necessary because of the many tunnels. Because of the winds, it is advisable to avoid wide panniers and loose fitting clothes. A lightweight recumbent should be considered as a serious option for those experienced with this type of bicycle, especially when cycling south to north.\n\nThe roads are generally paved well, although gravel roads are sometimes unavoidable. As long as you don't go off-road, you will not need suspension or grooved tyres.\n\nBecause of the long distances and numerous hills, bicycle tourists are advised to plan well and be prepared to use public transport for the less interesting or difficult stretches. Particularly in western and northern Norway, passenger boats (including longer tourist ferries) can sometimes be used to avoid tunnels, mountain passes or less interesting stretches.\n\nFerries take bikes for free or a minimal charge. On trains you have to pay a fare. Some buses do not allow bikes, but in all other cases will only be transported if there is enough space (no fare or children's fare). The Norwegian Cyclist Association ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.syklistene.no\/"]}," offers information.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Berdalstunnelen.JPG"],["thumb"],["Long (4 km) and narrow tunnel, not recommended for bikes."]]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Tunnels"]},"\nSpecial attention should be given to tunnels, as many of them are forbidden for cyclists, as are a few roads. Some long and narrow tunnels are not recommended for bikes, even if allowed. An online map of tunnels can be found ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cycletourer.co.uk\/maps\/tunnelmap.shtml"]},". The tourist information also has a map of those forbidden routes. When hiring a bike, you can consult the person that lends you the bike concerning the track you want to take. In many cases, signposts indicate the route for cyclists and pedestrians around forbidden roads or tunnels. Some of the high speed tunnels have bus stops a short distance from the entrance where you can board special buses equipped with bike racks to transport you through the tunnel. On main roads, buses usually run frequently. Some subsea tunnels are in addition really steep. If you do enter a tunnel on bike, use lights and safety reflectors (such as reflector jacket or vest). Norwegian drivers don't slow down in tunnels.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Warning"]},": Do not underestimate the number and length of tunnels, particularly in western Norway. On the E16 between Bergen and Lærdal for instance, 30-50 % of the road is in tunnel. Frequently, tunnels replace an older road that remains open for bicycles and pedestrians in summer or for local traffic all year. Ask locals or read map carefully to find way.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By thumb"]},"\nHitchhiking in Norway is best on the routes from Oslo-Trondheim (E6), Oslo-Kristiansand (E18) and Kristiansand-Stavanger (E39). However, near the cities these are now motorways and it is not possible to stand at the road itself. Hitchhiking is not that common in Norway. If hitchhiking is ever safe, it's pretty safe in Norway, however it's difficult to get a lift and it may be very slow.\n\nWhen waiting make sure to stand in a place where the vehicles can see you and have a safe opportunity to stop. Ferry ports and main fuel stations are good places to try. Stretches with low speed limit (50-60) is generally better than high speed as drivers find it more cumbersome to make a halt. Drivers of heavy trucks in particular prefer to keep a steady speed. Roadside cafeterias where truckers have a break can be good place to ask for a lift.\n\nGood hitchhiking spots from major cities are:\nOslo to:\nBergen and the mountains- if you're daring, try Oksenøyveien (see Kristiansand), but be aware that most cars continue southwards to Drammen. Rather catch the Timekspressen bus, direction Hønefoss, to Sollihøgda.\nTrondheim and the north- is getting more difficult as motorway development continues. The best bet inside Oslo is bus stop Ulvenkrysset. Get the metro to Helsfyr, then bus 76, 401 or 411 for one stop. Further outside, to avoid the local traffic, you are best off at the Shell gas station at Skedsmovollen, bus 845 and 848 from Lillestrøm train station.\nKristiansand and the south: Few spots beat the bus stop Oksenøyveien, connected by bus 151, 251 and 252. You may be dropped in Sandvika by cars heading towards Hønefoss and the mountains\/Bergen. Carry a sign.\nSweden along E6: Highway all the way, except close to the centre. Try the bus stop Nedre Bekkelaget, bus 81 and 83.\nSweden along E18: You may try Nedre Bekkelaget, but as most traffic continue towards Strömstad and Gothenburg, you should rather catck the Timekspressen bus 9 to Østensjø stop, just after the Holstad roundabout. \n\nBergen to:\nOslo - Get local train to Arna and try near the entrance to Arnanipa tunnel.\nNorthwards - Go by bus to Vågsbotn in Arna, and try hithing a ride close to the Hjelle bakery.\nSouthwards - Get the light rail to Nesttun, then nearly any bus for three stops to Skjoldskiftet. Hitch southwards along E39.\n\nTrondheim to:\nOslo - Get bus 46 to the shopping centre City Syd, then go under the E6 and try your luck at City Syd E6 stop. Soon, the city tax on buses will be extended past the Klett roundabout, if this is in effect you should go to the bus stop just after the roundabout at any Melhus-bound bus and try your luck there.\nMolde\/Ålesund - Get any Orkanger bus to the stop just after Klett roundabout. Soon, Trondheim city tax will extend to Børsa, after which you should stay on the bus for as long as you can, and hitch a ride from there.\nNorthwards - Get city bus 7 or 66 to Travbanen stop.\nSweden - To be sure to hitch only on cars going towards Sweden, get a train or bus to Stjørdal and hitch on the E14.\n\nIn general, looking polite and friendly is a good trick. Asking cars in line at a ferry quay (if travelling along the coast) is a very good idea, and may bring you very far. Hitching rides from Molde all the way to Bergen are not unheard of, but don't bet on it.\n\nIn general though, you can really get to anywhere from anywhere by thumb, just in some places it might take a while.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["seealso"],["Norwegian phrasebook"]]},"\n\nThere is no standard spoken ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Norwegian phrasebook"],["Norwegian"]]}]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["norsk"]},") and a wide range of dialects is used even in public broadcasting.

While it is possible to travel in Norway on a limited budget, some care must be taken. Because labour is costly, anything that can be seen as a \"service\" will in general be more expensive than you expect. Travel costs can also be a killer, because the country is large and distances long, so a rail or air pass can save you a lot of money.\n\nAs rules of thumb, subsisting on under 500 NOK\/day will be difficult even if you stay in hostels and self-cater, with 1000 NOK\/day allowing a more comfortable mid-range lifestyle and over 2000 NOK\/day needed for good hotels and restaurants.\n\nTake care when buying alcohol and tobacco. It will most certainly be more expensive than you expect. A 400 or 500 ml beer in a pub or restaurant will cost around 60 NOK whilst a 500 ml can of 4.7% beer in a supermarket costs about 25 NOK. Cigarettes cost about 90 kr for a pack of 20, and a bottle of 500 ml Coke will usually cost 15 NOK. On the positive side: Norway has good quality tap water. Buying bottled drinking water is unnecessary and hugely expensive.\n\nFast food restaurants like McDonalds and Burger King are also more expensive than in most countries due to the labour costs. A large BigMac menu will set you back around 90 NOK, the same goes for a Double Whopper Cheese menu. Also, keep in mind that most bakeries, fast food chains, and other types of restaurants that offer takeout, charge more if you eat it at the restaurant than if you take it with you, due to differences in the VAT rate.\n\nIn Norway, waiters are not dependent on tips from customers as they are in the US, as they are well paid. However, tipping is not unusual in mid- to high-end cafés and restaurants, but only if you feel you have been treated well. Tipping cab drivers is usual if you travel for more than 200 NOK, but you will get no reaction from the driver should you choose not to tip, so this may be a new experience to American and English tourists. Tipping is never considered offensive, but not tipping is also rarely frowned upon.\n\nIf you are a bit careful about your expenses a daily budget of around 1500 NOK (€190) per day is not unrealistic.\n\nYou can save some money by bringing supplies. Be aware of the strict Norwegian border regulations, which allow a maximum of 200 cigarettes or 250 grams of tobacco, 1 litre of hard alcohol and 1 1\/2 litre of wine and 2 litres of beer OR 3 litres of wine and 2 litres of beer OR 5 litres of beer. As a general rule, tobacco, alcohol and meat will be comparatively expensive. Vegetables, flour, baby articles, car supplies (oil, window wiper fluid and so on), and clothes will have (almost) the same price as in neighbouring countries, or even be cheaper.\n\nMany Norwegians living near the borders with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sweden"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Finland"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russia"]]}," head into those countries to purchase groceries, as the costs are significantly cheaper. While the option of crossing into Russia is not available for most travellers due to Russia's onerous visa requirements, those visiting areas near the Swedish or Finnish borders should consider this option before travelling to other areas, as there are no border controls between Norway and Sweden or Finland.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Money exchange"]},"\nIt is possible to exchange money in most banks near tourist information offices, in the post-office or withdraw the money in local currency from the ATM. In some places, however, they don't handle cash in the banks so they only way to exchange money is in the post offices where the exchange fee might be up to 75 kr (9.5 €, US$ 12.2)!\n\nYou will get the best rate when you withdraw money from the ATM or simply pay with a credit card. Note that the country is currently upgrading to a new system using computer chips embedded in the card and a pin number. Credit cards with magnetic strips are still accepted throughout the country; however, you will have to let the merchant know that the you do not have a pin code you need to sign instead. It is also important to note that sometimes a merchant system will not allow signatures, so it is a good precaution to have cash on hand to pay if needed.\n\nFor example (August 2009) the exchange rate in the bank was 8,75 NOK for €1 (taking into consideration that it is not possible to exchange an amount for more than 5000 NOK per one transaction and there is a commission of 100 NOK for each transaction); in the tourist information office the rate exchange was 7,28 (no commissions), by withdrawal from ATM the rate was 7,74 (taking into consideration all the bank commissions).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Shopping"]},"\nOpening hours in Norway are better than they used to be, though many smaller stores still close early on Saturday (1 PM or 3 PM is typical) and nearly everything is closed on Sundays.

You'll often see opening hours written as \"9-21 (9-18)\" on doors, meaning 9 AM to 9 PM weekdays, 9 AM to 6 PM Saturday. The grocery market is dominated by a handful of chains covering most of Norway: Rimi, Rema 1000, Kiwi, Prix and Bunnpris are low price shops with a narrow selection of items; Coop, ICA and Spar have wider selection and better quality at a slightly higher price; Meny, Mega and Ultra have fewer shops and higher prices.\n\nConvenience stores, notably the major chains ",{"type":"'''","value":["Narvesen"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mix"]}," (all over the country), ",{"type":"'''","value":["Deli de Luca"]}," (Oslo, Stavanger, and Bergen only) and ",{"type":"'''","value":["7-Eleven"]}," (bigger cities only), are open from early morning until late at night every day, with 24 hour service in the biggest cities.

Convenience stores and gas stations are relatively expensive.\n\nMost big cities have over the years been almost exclusively dominated by shopping malls. Although you do have shopping streets like Karl Johans Gate in Oslo, Strandgaten in Bergen and Nordre gate\/Olav Tryggvasons gate in Trondheim, you are bound to find malls around the country by Thon Gruppen and other major companies. Norway is also home to Scandinavias biggest mall - Sandvika Storsenter - located 15 minutes outside Oslo by train. In Oslo you have Byporten Shopping Senter, Oslo City and Gunerius located right next to Oslo S train station and Paléet and Arkaden Shopping in Karl Johans Gate, as well as several malls and shopping centres a bit further out.\n\nGetting \"good deals\" and bargaining is frowned upon, and the service workers are generally not authorized to give you a better price - only larger items such as cars are subject to haggling. The price you see is the price you pay. If you plan on buying tax-free, a good practice is to bring with you the necessary forms.  Most stores will have these forms at hand themselves but it is a good precaution. Also, if you pay with credit card, you might have to sign the receipt which will require some form of ID, drivers license and passport are both ok.

Lunch usually consists of some bread and snacks instead of a warm dish but this is then compensated by eating well at dinner time.

The words derives from German and can be translated into pre- and afterparty. If going out in the weekend, it is not unknown for Norwegians to gather at a friends house and not leave there until after twelve in the evening. So if you've seen Norwegian drinking culture abroad, and are shocked by the empty bar\/club at ten o'clock, call your Norwegian friend and ask where the vorspiel is. (note if that person is Swedish, there are many of them in Norway, vorspiel means foreplay, they would say foreparty) It's likely to be a whole lot of fun.

This law is very strict, and even encompasses your own balcony, if other people can see you! Luckily, the law is very seldom enforced (I've never heard of anyone being fined on their own balcony, for instance), and Norwegians indeed do drink in parks. There are calls for modifying the antiquated law, and recently, there has been a debate in media: most people seem to agree that drinking in parks is alright as long as people have a good time and remain peaceful. However, if you bother others and get too intoxicated or a policeman happens to be in a bad mood, you may be asked to throw away your alcohol, and in a worst-case scenario, fined. Drinking openly in the street is probably still considered somewhat rude, and it would be more likely to bring the police's attention than a picnic in a park, and is advised against.

If anything, it is important to keep in mind that Norway is perhaps the most egalitarian country in the world. Behaving in a way that suggest either party is inferior or superior is considered exceptionally rude, and the flaunting of wealth or rank (if any) is frowned upon. Most Norwegians will handle misunderstandings or possibly offensive comments in a friendly manner and almost all will respond well to compliments paid to the country in general. \n\nMany Norwegian people can however be mistaken as somewhat rude and unwelcoming, because they can be very direct and that small talk generally doesn't come easy. This is just a matter of culture; making contact with strangers, such as talking with fellow passengers on the bus, is uncommon. This does not apply to train journeys, or outside the bigger cities where small talk will be made upon the base of curiosity. During hikes in remote wilderness, talking to strangers on the same trail is customary.\n\nFurthermore, Norwegian as a language is very straightforward. The once common use of the polite pronoun is nowadays extremely rare, and so are polite phrases and words in everyday situations, so don't be offended if a Norwegian speaking a foreign language uses a very familiar language. The use of informal language also applies when shopping, checking in at hotels and similar, but do not expect small talk in those situations either. Norwegian does not have something corresponding directly to ",{"type":"''","value":["please"]}," (German ",{"type":"''","value":["bitte"]},"), some may say ",{"type":"''","value":["unnskyld"]}," (excuse me) to call your attention.

For instance after a eating or travelling together some Norwegians says ",{"type":"''","value":["thanks for good company"]},". Many Norwegians also express a ",{"type":"''","value":["thanks for last time we met"]}," for instance a few days after meeting a party. \n\nThe Norwegian culture in general is very informal and Norwegians usually address each other's by first name only, except perhaps in official meetings. The informal culture is not equivalent of that in southern parts of Europe; showing up late for meetings is considered rude, so is talking loud, being too personal with strangers and losing your temper. It is customary to take off your shoes when entering a Norwegian home, in winter this is often a necessity. \n\nNorwegians' reputation for being cold and unwelcoming may be a result of a surprisingly complex unwritten code of conduct with many apparent contradictions. For example; while as noted before it is very uncommon to make contact with strangers at public transportation like buses, the opposite is true when you meet Norwegians in outdoor activities like hiking or skiing: Greeting a fellow hiker or skier is expected, not doing so is often considered quite rude. Another phenomena that often confuse foreigners is the role of alcohol in social interactions. It is best explained as the grease that enables Norwegians to meet and make contact without too much friction, again with exceptions.

May 17, the constitution day, can perhaps be a bit overwhelming for foreigners, as the country is covered in flags, citizens dress up in their finest clothes and celebrate all day long.
