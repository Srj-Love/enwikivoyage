[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Skibotn banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Norwegian"]}," is the language spoken in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Norway"]]},". It's closely related to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Danish phrasebook"],["Danish"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Swedish phrasebook"],["Swedish"]]},", and most speakers of the three languages can understand each other without much difficulty. Norwegian is also historically closely related to Icelandic and Faroese, but is no longer mutually intelligible with them as they have diverged too much during the last millennium. Norwegian is also related to English, Dutch and German with a large number of similar words. \n\nWritten Norwegian is very close to Danish and phrasebooks for the two languages can largely be used interchangeably. Almost all of Norway's 5 million citizens speak Norwegian, while most Norwegians also speak reasonably good English; and a few know languages like French, German and Spanish from school or ones like Polish, Russian, Arabic, Persian, Urdu and Somali because of immigrant roots. Norwegian is written with the \"standard Latin alphabet\" (identical to the English alphabet) and three additional vowels (\"Æ\"\/\"æ\", \"Ø\"\/\"ø\" and \"Å\"\/\"å\"; respectively added in that order to the end of the other 26 letters; the alphabet is identical to that of Danish). Some of these letters are used very rarely, for varying reasons, because they may only be found in loanwords or be disfavoured in comparison because of either more archaic or newer spellings. Like in English, diacritic marks are relatively rare, because such traits as the dot over the \"i\" and the circle above the \"å\" aren't considered as such marks, but as parts of distinct letters; the most common occurrence of them is the use of an acute accent with the final \"e\" in a word where stress is to be put on that \"e\", such as in \"idé\" (idea), allé (avenue) and kafé (cafe).\n\nBecause Norwegian is a Germanic language, learning a decent form of Norwegian shouldn't be too hard if you already speak English, German and\/or Dutch. Norwegian ",{"type":"'''","value":["grammar"]}," is similar to English and relatively easy compared to German. For example, the role of a word is determined by its place in the syntax, rather than by morphology. Norwegian basically only has two grammatical cases: Nominative and genitive - genitive differs from nominative by an \"s\" at the end of the noun (like in English, but without the apostrophe). Verbs are not conjugated according to person. Adjectives are (like in English) placed before the noun. Norwegian has three grammatical genders, and nouns are inflected according to their grammatical gender, though many Norwegians use only two genders, both in speech and writing. Regular plural forms of nouns are formed with the suffix \"-er\", or just \"-r\" if the noun ends in an \"e\" (examples: \"en katt, katter\" = \"a cat, cats\"; \"et bilde, bilder\" = \"a picture, pictures\") and instead of using a definite article like English \"the\", Norwegian uses suffixes for this as well, along the same lines as how plurals are made (examples: \"katten, kattene\" = \"the cat, the cats\"; \"bildet, bildene\" = \"the picture, the pictures\").\n\nAlthough modern Norwegian is relatively easy to understand and practice at a superficial level, learning Norwegian a hundred per-cent fluently is exceptionally difficult. There are several reasons to this: The first thing worth mentioning is that there is a wide range of ",{"type":"'''","value":["dialects"]}," in Norwegian, that could differ significantly to the standard written form. Due to the country's geography, being extremely long and narrow and sparsely populated with mountains and other obstacles, these dialects have had the opportunity to develop over time. There is no standard spoken Norwegian, and it is fully socially accepted (even highly regarded) to use your local dialect whatever the context or situation. Politicians and news reporters all do this. Norwegian has a number of idioms, many of which are used regularly but hardly make any sense to an outsider (they just have to be learned). Many idioms originate from playwright Henrik Ibsen, from the ancient sagas (compiled by Icelander Snorre Sturlason), or from the Bible, as well as from popular culture. The weak Norwegian verbs could also have one of five different endings. \n\nThere are two official variations of ",{"type":"''","value":["written"]}," Norwegian: ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bokmål"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Nynorsk"]},". The differences are small, but important to a lot of Norwegians. Bokmål is by far the most common, and evolved from Danish. Nynorsk is a reconstructed standard written form, developed by Ivar Aasen, a teacher and linguist. Aasen traveled through most of the country, except for the eastern parts, because he felt those parts had been too heavily influenced by Danish language. Between 1848 and 1855, Aasen published grammar, lexicon, dialect samples, and a set of readings as he developed Nynorsk (called then ",{"type":"''","value":["landsmål"]},") A summary of the language situation can be found at: http:\/\/odin.dep.no\/odin\/engelsk\/norway\/history\/032005-990497\/index-dok000-b-n-a.html\n\nIn 2003, approximately 15% of primary school pupils were in school districts that taught Nynorsk as the primary written standard. \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Numbers, time and dates"]},"\nNote that Norwegians use comma as the decimal sign, for instance 12,000 means 12 (specified with three decimal places) not 12 thousand, whereas 12.000 means 12 thousand. Norwegians use both the 24 and 12 hour time system, with spoken often being the 12 hour system and the 24 hour system often used in writing. Norwegians don't use PM\/AM to indicate morning or afternoon. Dates can be abbreviated in a number of ways, but the order is always DATE-MONTH-YEAR, for instance 12.07.08 is July 12, 2008.\n\nOther notable features:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Unlike some Germanic neighbors, in Norwegian the definite article is postfixed (a suffix) while the indefinite article is a separate word like in English (a house = et hus; the house = huset).

A \"short\" vowel will almost always be followed by a double consonant (i.e. two similar consonants, such as ll or tt).

The Norwegian alphabet has three letters more than the English alphabet, vowels æ (Æ), ø (Ø), and å (Å). Here's the full list:\n\n; a : like 'a' in \"father\" \n; e : like 'e' in \"where\" (but like æ if it is followed by an 'r')(some exceptions, see below)\n; i : like 'i' in \"pin\"\n; o (",{"type":"''","value":["short"]},") : mostly like 'o' in how the British say \"Ox\", rendering it a short 'å'; but in a few cases simply a short \"oo\", just like a short 'u'\n; o (",{"type":"''","value":["long"]},") : similar to a common pronunciation of 'oo' in \"fool\" or \"cool\"\n; u : (",{"type":"''","value":["long"]},") like the \"oo\" in \"shoot\" or \"ou\" in a possible rendering of \"route\"\n; u : (",{"type":"''","value":["short"]},") same sound as a long 'o' only short (much like the English \"put\")\n; y : like 'i' in \"pin\" (but narrower; y doesn't correspond to any sound in English. English speakers may have difficulty distinguishing Norwegian's i and y. It's similar to German ü or French u.) Halfway between \"ee\" and \"ewwww\".\n; æ : like 'a' in \"mad\"; almost always long. A short \"ær\" sound is spelled 'er'.\n; ø : like 'u' as in \"burn\" (\"bu:n\"). One starts with e and rounds one's lips to produce ø.\n; å : like 'o' as in \"lord\" (Note: in older texts or names written as \"aa\"); it is long unless followed by a double consonant.\n\n\n\nThe letters 'o' and 'u' may give you the most trouble.
