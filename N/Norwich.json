There are six P&R car parks served by six colour-coded lines numbered 601-606.  P&R buses run every 6–7 minutes throughout the day but stop around 7-8pm. Tickets are purchased from machines at the car park and are valid for a group of up to 5 people. The prices regularly change but there's generally a 25% discount for tickets purchased after 12pm.

Park&Ride Yellow Line buses run every 7–8 minutes from the airport car park to Surrey Street bus station non-stop, however the one-way fare is £2.50 so if there's a group it's easier to buy a park & Ride ticket from the machines as this covers up to 5 passengers.

London Street is nearby and was England's first pedestrianised street. The market is the site of the principal shopping area and is occupied by well-known chain stores; additionally, a wide range of independent specialist stores is concentrated around the Upper Goat Lane\/Pottergate\/St. Benedict's area of the city centre.

Upper St Giles is home to a number of independent shops, restaurants and delicatessens.
