Its prosperity is historically derived mostly from the lace making and coal-mining industries, little of which now remains. Nottingham has moved towards a more service-based economy.\n\nThe centre of Nottingham lies on the River Leen and its southern boundary follows the course of the River Trent, which flows from Stoke to the Humber. According to the 2001 census, Nottingham has an estimated city population of 275,100. The Nottingham Urban Area conurbation (which includes surrounding suburbs outside the city boundary, and neighbouring towns) has a population of 666,358 (2001 Census). Nottingham is a member of the English Core Cities Group.\n\nThe heart of the city is the Old Market Square, which underwent a major redevelopment in 2006. Most of the main shopping streets are around the square. The Council House, whose tall dome can be seen for miles around, is at the top end of the square. The inside of the Council House is the Exchange Arcade, a shopping centre. A bohemian quarter of the city known as Hockley ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.hockleyvillage.co.uk"]}," has arisen in recent years, situated close to the Lace Market area.
