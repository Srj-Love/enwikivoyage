One of the most westernized capitals in the Pacific Islands, it features beautiful beaches and colonial mansions and is not yet a heavily touristed destination.  Where metropolitan French will hear a bad French accent, wince and say that they speak English, the Francophones of New Caledonia are either less willing or less able to accommodate Anglophones.  It is probably a matter of capability, since they are marvellously willing to persevere in determining what it is that a foreigner needs.  Without tourist-level French, you may find yourself lost--but it's a lovely place to be lost!  The French spoken by Caledonians is much harder to understand than the French of people in Paris: on a par with Quebec French (or think of the challenge offered by broad Scots or Yorkshire for a naive English-speaker).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]}," \n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["New Caledonia Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["NOU"]]},"), in Païta, 52km northwest of Noumea, (687) 35 11 18, http:\/\/www.tontouta-aeroport.nc\/ Regular flights are available from Tokyo on ",{"type":"'''","value":["Aircalin"]},", as New Caledonia is very popular with the Japanese.

Others have recommended this only if you feel your French is up to scratch, as the bus drivers very rarely understand anything but French.  It is sufficient to know that the bus goes to \"Centre Ville\", then hand over the money and state the number of tickets required (une personne, deux personnes, trois personnes, etc.).  The big catch is working out where the buses start, as different lines leave from different places. The majority of buses go from near the ticket office in Place de la Marne, where Rue d'Austerlitz passes through the Place des Cocotiers. Other lines depart from a rough piece of ground near the corner of rue Clemenceau and rue de la Somme, within sight of the Municipal Markets and the cinema and a couple of blocks south of Place des Cocotiers.

Validation just means inserting them in a machine that will stamp them with a time and a date, but this is nowhere explained.

The city bus line is called  ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.karuiabus.nc Karuiabus"]},". \n\nThe first trick is to recognise a bus stop when you see one.  These are white-ish pillars, usually with a name on them, sometimes with a shelter from sun or rain, but usually with no indication of the line(s) that stop there.\n\nAlso available for tourists is a \"Noumea Explorer\" service that runs an hourly loop pass the major tourist sites (Museums, Parc Forestier and Zoo, Tjibaou and hotels) hourly. That for 1500CFP a day (March 2010 price), is a great idea to be used to explore each of the sites for an hour before catching the bus onto the next location when it comes past again.  The service takes a little over an hour, the stops are hard to locate at the start, and you need both a map that shows the stops, and also a leaflet from your hotel or a tourist office that gives the timetable.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nMost of the tourist attractions in Noumea are closed on Mondays and open all other days. with the exception of Museum of Caledonia that is closed on Tuesdays.

Walk up the street warily (the drivers are a bit wild) then pick up the track at the top end of the street.  This leads up to the road that comes from somewhere past the Meridien hotel.
