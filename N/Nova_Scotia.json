The novel \"Rockbound\" is written entirely in the South Shore dialect of the fishermen of that region, a fusion of Shakespearean English, German and unique local idioms.\n\nChamplain named Nova Scotia \"Acadie\" and claimed it for France in 1604. French immigrants settled the area and became prosperous farmers and fisherman until officially expelled by the British in the mid 18th century - their lands especially on the South Shore to be repopulated with \"foreign Protestants\" meaning mostly Dutch and German.  Many areas still retain a strong Acadian French culture, including the largest francophone municipality, Clare in Digby County and Argyle, in Yarmouth County.  Nova Scotia hosted the World Acadian Congress in 2005.  The Louisiana \"cajun\" is a slang adaptation of \"Acadien\" in the French.  Longfellow's poem \"Evangeline\" celebrates the victims of the Expulsion, as does Zachary Richard's drum and voice song \"Reveille\".  Because of the expulsion, French is far more commonly heard in New Brunswick.\n\nHalifax, the capital, is one of the oldest cities in North America and was a critical sea link during World Wars I and II.  The infamous \"Halifax explosion\" caused by collision of two ships in Halifax Harbour in 1917 was the worst man-made explosion on Earth until Hiroshima in 1945.  Halifax today is an education and high technology center with over a dozen post-secondary institutions including Dalhousie University and substantial operations by major high-technology firms.  Academics have unusual influence in Nova Scotia perhaps because of the concentration of them in the capital.  Many have even written legislation.\n\nUnless you are a winter surfer, or like to snowshoe, then it is probably best to visit Nova Scotia sometime June-Oct when the weather is warm, the skies are blue and the water may be less frigid.  The main byways are along the coast, and a lot of small shops and restaurants are open around the coast during the summer months.  Watch out for mosquitoes and horseflies in the summer, however, especially after a storm.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Robert L.
