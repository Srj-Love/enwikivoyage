Novara once had an encircling wall, which was demolished to permit urban development. Of the old wall there remains only the Barriera Albertina, a complex of two neo-classical buildings that constituted the gate of entry to the city, the required passageway for those who traveled from Turin to Milan. After their removal, the walls were replaced by the present-day baluardi, the broad, tree-lined boulevards that surround the Historic Centre.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Learn"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Work"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Budget"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Mid-range"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Splurge"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Budget"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Mid-range"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Splurge"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Piedmont"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Geo"],["45.4500"],["8.6167"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Novara"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Europe\/Italy\/Regions\/Piedmont\/Localities\/Novara"]]}]
