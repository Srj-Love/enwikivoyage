It's also possible to walk in a loop via the southern mining branch line\/access road. Sand dunes on 600m of permafrost - it's a bit odd!\n\nThe Kodar Mountains to the north are an ideal location for a hike lasting several days to several weeks or longer. Accessible in this way is several reasonably well preserved gulags that originally mined Uranium. They are also accessible by helicopter. Photos and artefacts from an expedition there are visible in the museum.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Zabaykalsky Krai"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Novaya Chara"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["56.795277777778"],["118.25416666667"]]}]
