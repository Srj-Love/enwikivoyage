In winter residents build an ice town on the Ob River, and in summer you can go to the beach. Near the city center on Krasny Prospekt,you can also see some excellent works in the Novosibirsk Art Museum and Local Studies Museum.

You'll never see any buses with tourists visiting the city. Yet Novosibirsk is the third biggest city in Russia, it's probably one of the most not touristic destinations in the country. You won't find a lot of touristic guides and prospects about the city. However, if you are interested in exploring real Russia and Siberia and understanding Russian culture, seeing what life in Russia is like and getting in touch with Russia and Russian household, it's a must visit place. Here are a couple of things you might do while staying there:\n\n1.  One of the things you should do is visiting Opera House (Novosibirsk State Academic Opera and Ballet Theater). Here is the link to their web-page http:\/\/www.opera-novosibirsk.ru\/index.php?locale=en_us. But it's recommended to book tickets in advance. They have very nice operas and ballets and they usually play classic things. Many of the plays are known around the world and it'd be very interesting to see a sort of Siberian interpretation. The Opera House is situated on Lenin Square and you can get there by catching a subway train. There are also a lot of buses and troleybuses running to OperaHouse. The location is very central and you'll easily find it.\n\n2.  As there's a lot of snow in Siberia in winter, going skiing or ice skating could be a lot of fun in Novosibirsk. There are a lot of ice arenas in the city. Some of them are free of charge, but those don't usually rent skaters. The ones that rent skaters may be not free of charge. One of the central stadiums is \"Spartak\", it's quite central.\n\n3. Try some Russian specialties, such as pancakes (\"Blini\") and \"pelmeni\").

They offer a lot of goods from all round the world and you can have a great time while shopping. However, be careful when buying anything there - always check what you buy, before you pay. Sometimes the goods you buy may be produced not by a brand company but by a company in an Asian country that has a license for producing products under this brand name. Sometimes the quality of these goods doesn't correspond to the quality of the original brand. This may be especially applied to the European brands. For example, the same scents may have a different aroma in Novosibirsk and somewhere in Europe. It doesn't mean that the goods have bad quality and you shouldn't shop. But be careful if you want to purchase anything.\nYou could have a lot of fun if you go to markets like Central Market (\"Центральный рынок\") or \"Baraholka\". There you'll see people from around the world selling stuff that is not brand but it may have a good quality. Be careful there as well, as you may run into pocket pickers. You may even find some local food there and try some specials. There are a lot of different markets in the city but the most famous are Central Market and Baroholka.
