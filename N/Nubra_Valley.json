The color of the trees during the months of Sep and Oct turns to yellowish red and is a treat to watch. The gentle Nubra enhance the charm. The mountains just rise from the valley as some child has made them of mud. Snow can be seen on the peaks.  There is minimal public transport available in Panamik or nearby areas.

Until 1971 a part of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Baltistan"]]},", shared strong economic and cultural ties with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tibet"]]},". The residents speak Baltistani, and some Ladakhi and English.\n\nTurtuk is the penultimate village open to foreign tourists before Pakistan. You can go on for a few KMs to the village of Shaksey (with a single guesthouse). There is another village before the Line of Control, closed off to foreigners as of August 2012.  Turtuk is on the edge of the Shyok Valley, in popular understanding a part of the Nubra Valley area. As such, foreign visitors will need an ",{"type":"'''","value":["Inner Line Permit"]}," to visit Turtuk, as for anywhere else in Nubra. These permits are easily issued via any of the many travel agencies in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Leh"]]},", or directly via the Magistrate Office in Leh. You will need your passport, passport copies and between 300-450 Rs.  Before setting off to Turtuk or anywhere in the Shyok Valley, prepare at least three photocopies of the permit (more if you also plan to visit the Nubra Valley, e.g. Panamik), as the checkpoints you will encounter will usually ask you to deposit a photocopy with them.\n\nTurtuk is serviced by a local bus service from Leh a few times a week, and back. Enquire at the New Bus Stand in Leh for detailed schedule. Notice it is a long and bumpy ride, although the road is well-paved almost all the way from Leh, apart from Khardung La, as of August 2012. Most people, however, opt to share a jeep for a 2-3 day trip to the entire valley, organized in Leh; this seems quite a short time to enjoy the beautiful village, however.  Hitchhiking might be hard since there is very little traffic going on the Diskit-Turtuk road, apart from the multitude of military trucks and tourist jeeps.  It can be very pleasure to motor-cycle or bicycle in here, but don't expect to buy any provisions on the ~90km way from Diskit.  The actual village is on the plateu above the Shyok river, not the houses around the road.\n\nIt can be extremely pleasurable to stroll around this pictureqsue village. The documentary film ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cultureunplugged.com\/play\/1591\/Prayers-Answered ‘Prayers Answered’"]}," by Geleck Pasang, a former student of TCV school Ladakh and Bylakupee, documents a visit in August 2005 of the Tibetan leader Dalai Lama to Turtuk.

Chang, a local brew (type of ale or beer) and butter tea are must haves in Nubra. Camel safaris are yet another way to see the valley. Bactrian camels, which were once used as pack animals are quite popular today as a convenient mode of transport for the locals. There are a row of shops in Diskit. Trekking to gompas and villages rewards with endless scenic vistas from snow-covered mountains to gorges and deep valleys for the adventure buffs. Saboo to Khalsar and beyond is a good trek option to start with. Close to the village of Sumur, lies a beautiful camp site by the river. Camping is suggested for a day or two. \n\nmomo, thupka with mutton\n\nTurtuk:  There is a restaurant on the \"main drag\" and also a tea shop near the Mosque. Otherwise just rely on your guesthouse or homestay family for the freshest meals. Remember that if visiting in the summer, you could well be here during the Islamic holy fasting month of Ramadan (or ",{"type":"''","value":["Ramzan"]}," to the locals), in which the locals don't eat from sunrise to sunset. Your host family or gueshouse will still serve you lunch, but don't expect for too much.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nDotted with guest houses and budget hotels, Diskit is a major halt for tourists.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Turtuk"]},"\nThe easiest and cheapest option is probably staying with a home-stay, e.g. Kashmiri Homestay or Issue Homestay. In August 2012, this cost 300 Rs per night per person, including supper and breakfast, with very nice conditions. These home-stays are easily found once up in the main part of the village. \n\nThere is a government guesthouse on the right as you enter the village. \n\nThe \"Maha Guesthouse\" is very nice and situated on the side of the village before you cross the river.\n\"Balti Residency\" is a homestay run by Abdullah, and is in the side of the village after crossing the river. It's unmarked, and there are no signs, so it's best to ask. If you find the Mosque, you are close and someone will show you the rest of the way.\nThere is a tent camp on the right as you enter the village but it's quite expensive (Rs2800 min.).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nThe only way out is to go back to Leh and then proceed somewhere else.
