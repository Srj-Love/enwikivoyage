That does not change the fact though that the beaches here are glorious - white sand, deep, long and safe for swimming. The public beach at Geger is the best to head to if you are not staying at Nusa Dua. This is also home to one of the best museums in Bali. The fact that it is nearly always empty is testament that most visitors who stay here in the least Balinese part of the island are, not unsurprisingly, rather disinterested in learning much about Bali.\n\nThe Nusa Dua enclave has three manned gates and everyone entering is subject to a security search. This can have a slightly claustrophobic effect, and only contributes further to the impression that you are in an artificial location.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Bali-NusaDua-Map.png"],["thumb"],["500px"],["right"],["Map of the Nusa Dua area"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nNusa Dua is located 40km south of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Denpasar"]]},", the provincial capital of Bali.
