More than 40 airlines fly regular flight to and from here. Everything you would expect from a large international airport is here: plenty of restaurants, shops and ATMs.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nFirst opened in 1952, this airport has been renamed twice in the last couple of years; you may find that people and publications still refer to it by its previous names of Johannesburg International Airport or Jan Smuts. It is also known by the abbreviation ORTIA. The airport is constantly expanding, and you will probably find construction work in progress: the current big project is an additional international terminal.\n\nThe airport's location at around 1700m above the sea level combined with the sometimes high temperatures demand a longer takeoff run or a lower takeoff weight than average airports. Still the airport is accessible to all common airplane types. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Configuration"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Ekurhuleni Aerotropolis.jpg"],["thumb"],["Terminal buildings at OR Tambo."]]},"\nThe arrival area is at the ground floor of the terminal. That's also where the passport control, the baggage claim and the customs are located.\n\nThe airport is organized into two main terminals, linked by a common atrium: Terminal A and Terminal B.  Terminal A (the northern one) is for international flights and Terminal B (the southern one) is for domestic flights.  The vast majority of international check-in counters are in Terminal A, but South African Airways international passengers must check in at SAA's counters in Terminal B even though their flights will depart from Terminal A. \n\nMost airlines have their ticket counters in the departure hall at the second floor. There more than 100 E-Check-in counters, and if youâ€™re departing on an European airline, you will likely be using those with the higher numbers. After security you will get to the gates, just like at any airport. \n\nOR Tambo's directional signage is notoriously vague and confusing, so ask for directions whenever you feel lost. For example, when you first approach the check-in counters, you will see many signs designating the counters by numbers, but no signs indicating ",{"type":"''","value":["which"]}," airlines correspond to which numbers.   Some of the signs in Terminal A imply that the fastest way to the Car Rentals area is to walk ",{"type":"''","value":["through"]}," the parkade, which is incorrect.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Baggage"]},"\nFor anyone who arrives and looks lost there are a large number of official and unofficial porters in the arrivals halls and outside the terminals in the area connecting the International Terminal and the Domestic Terminal. The official porters have bright orange uniforms and navy-blue shirts, and carry ACSA permits. They work exclusively for tips: a general guide is to give R5 (five South African rands) a bag.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Tourist information"]},"\nThere are several well-marked tourist information and help desk booths at the airport.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Flights"]},"\nDomestic destinations within ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South Africa"]]}," include: ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bloemfontein"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cape Town"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Durban"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["East London"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kimberley (South Africa)"],["Kimberley"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Port Elizabeth"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Upington"]]},".\nSome of the local airlines are ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.flysaa.com South African Airways"]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.comair.co.za British Airways (Comair)"]},"  and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Low-cost_airlines_in_Africa#South_Africa"],["low-cost carriers"]]}," ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.1time.co.za 1Time"]}," and ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.kulula.com Kulula.com"]},". \n\nOR Tambo International is one of the very few airports that have ",{"type":"'''","value":["nonstop flights to all inhabited continents"]},".

Delta Air Lines runs flights from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Atlanta"]]}," via ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dakar"]]},"  to Johannesburg as the only major US carrier to fly to Africa.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Connections"]},"\n\nWhen planning connections to domestic destinations within South Africa, note that OR Tambo does not have a direct link between the secure arrival area of Terminal A and the secure departure area of Terminal B. As in the United States, you will have to pass through customs and immigration if OR Tambo is your first stop in SA. Also, note that Terminal B does not have jetways or aircraft parking spots within walking distance for the domestic E Gates. In other words, the E Gates are actually a tarmac-level bus terminal for buses that take you to aircraft sitting at very remote parking spots.  \n\nThus, to be assured of a smooth connection from international to domestic SA flights, you need to incorporate a minimum of at least ",{"type":"'''","value":["two hours"]}," to pass through immigration control upon arrival at Terminal A, retrieve your baggage and go through customs, check your baggage again at the Connecting Flights counter on your left after exiting Customs, walk over to Terminal B departures, pass through Terminal B security control, and then walk to your gate. Of course this does not apply in the case your baggage is already checked through to the final destination.\nThen you may then have to take a bus ride if your aircraft was assigned to an E gate.  \n\nFinally, the Connecting Flights counter is small and understaffed and lines tend to accumulate quickly.  It's not a mere bag drop. They will have to look at your papers just as when you checked in. Since you will have to pass through Terminal B security anyway, it may be faster to take your baggage over to the domestic check-in counters if the lines are long and your connection period is very tight.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Ground transportation"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nThe airport is located at the intersection of the R21 and R24 freeways.
