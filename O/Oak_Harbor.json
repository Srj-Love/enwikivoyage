Sumner from New England Houses and businesses sprouted up along the shores of Oak Harbor as the pioneers relied entirely on water transportation until the 1900s. For the next thirty years, steamers and freighters carried passengers and freight from the Island to the mainland and back as well as Fidalgo Island to the north.\n\nThe Irish came in the late 1850s, making Oak Harbor grow and prosper as they fished and farmed the area, and the city's Dutch heritage arrived in the 1890s. Churches, schools, and more businesses followed the arrival of the Dutch. A high school was built in 1906. Oak Harbor flourished as a small country town until Deception Pass Bridge and the U.S. Navy Base connected the city to the rest of the region and the world.\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Oak Harbor City Marina"],["url=http:\/\/www.oakharbor.org\/"],["email="],["address=1401 SE Catalina Dr, Oak Harbor, WA"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +1 360  279-4575"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content= conveniently located between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Seattle"]]}," and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Juan Islands"]]},".
