Oakland's history in the arts and entertainment arena is notable as well, as Oakland has nurtured or been a second home to novelists Gertrude Stein, Jack London, Amy Tan, and Maya Angelou; actors Meryl Streep, Mark Hamill, Bruce Lee, and Tom Hanks; architect Julia \"Butterfly\" Hill; classical conductor Calvin Simmons; rappers MC Hammer, 2Pac, Messy Marv, and several other notables in the liberal arts and sciences.\n\nOakland as a city reflects the amazing diversity of its residents and long history.

Many of the buildings and streets of Chinatown reflect the diverse nature of its history, in architecture and in the bilingual signs seen throughout the neighborhood.\n\nThe curious traveler can venture to take a bus southwards along Broadway, and come to ",{"type":"'''","value":["Jack London Square"]},". The unlikely mixture of warehouses and very expensive restaurants and posh atmosphere alongside some of the landmarks of the city's waterfront makes the Square an interesting place to visit and explore, even for locals. It's the home of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["USS Potomac"]}," and the site of the namesake author's residence, still preserved and humbly standing not far from a saloon from the same era.\n\nJust west of Downtown and slightly north of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Financial District"]}," is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Uptown"]},". In the evening it buzzes with art galleries, theaters and residents and Bay Area visitors coming into the area to see concerts. A popular area on the weekend with a mixed vibe of hipster and hip hop. It's a burgeoning neighborhood of performing arts ranging from nightclubs to music halls, avant-garde performance art, and even an improv theater company.

Northeast of Temescal and near the Berkeley border lies ",{"type":"'''","value":["Rockridge"]},", a neighborhood mixed with family friendly and artistic vibes.

South of Rockridge, and southeast of Temescal lies ",{"type":"'''","value":["Piedmont Avenue"]},", a street extending from Broadway near 34th and Hawthorne and an area with a group of hospitals on a hill (Pill Hill) up and through a neighborhood bordered on both sides by picturesque hills, houses and trees. Another of North Oakland's group of foodie spots, home to the city's single Michelin-rated restaurant and many others; cafes, ice cream, coffee shops and pleasant walks complete the vision of this interesting and quiet neighborhood. East along I-580 and not far from Piedmont Avenue are two neighborhoods separated by a couple of blocks. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Grand Lake"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Lakeshore"]}," both share a friendly, suburban sort of feel.

It has seen a period of decline between the 1960s and the more recent past. Strangely, twice in its history the neighborhood has seen benefits from major earthquakes. After the 1906 earthquake, many San Franciscans relocated there, and the industrial development of the 20s and 30s saw its population in the hundreds of thousands. With Loma Prieta in 1989, the effective barrier of the Cypress Street Overpass was destroyed, and the decades since have seen the rebuilding and refurbishing of many of the neighborhood's original Victorian houses, and there is a burgeoning performing arts community growing near the center of the neighborhood. Though there are a few draws for the traveler, West Oakland is dominantly a very poor working-class residential neighborhood with a less than spectacular reputation.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By plane "]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["Oakland or Auckland?"],["It's not just ",{"type":"''","value":["Full House'"]},"s Stephanie and Michelle Tanner that have ended up in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Auckland"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Zealand"]]}," instead of Oakland, California.
