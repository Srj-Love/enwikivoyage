A strange mix in a strange, interesting town.\n\nOamaru started its existence in the mid-1800s as one of a few large sheep farms in North Otago. The natural harbour was recognised and a breakwater built to facilitate trade. Buildings sprung up – banks, grain stores, post offices and a court house – built with a type of limestone called ",{"type":"'''","value":["Oamaru stone"]}," because it is sourced locally and used all over the country. Oamaru fell on hard times and lacked resources to pull down the older buildings while other towns were replacing older buildings with new ones. As a result Oamaru has a fantastic collection of older buildings in an unspoilt precinct by the harbour. Better times have returned recently with the district becoming wealthy through the ",{"type":"'''","value":["meat, dairy and education"]}," industries and this has allowed the locals to restore and strengthen the old buildings.\n\nToday Oamaru is a little known tourism spot where prices tend to be reasonable for accommodation (of which there is a glut) and there are some exceptional restaurants, which you would not generally expect in a town this size.\n\nVisitors come to view the nightly return to shore of little blue penguins. The town has several colonies of these birds, the smallest and only blue variety of penguin in the world. The largest colony is now run as a commercial activity by the town council, offering an opportunity to view the penguins in their natural habitat. There is also a small colony of yellow-eyed penguins, one of the world's rarest penguins, just outside the town.\n\nOamaru is the gateway to the Waitaki Valley, a stunning natural area bisected by the braided Waitaki River, whose dams have created numerous lakes for water sports and recreation. The Waitaki Valley is home to New Zealand's newest wine appellation, where a number of vineyards are producing Pinot Noir, Pinot Gris, Riesling and other varietals that are winning international awards.\n\nPartly because of its impressive architecture, and partly because of its artsy nature, Oamaru has become New Zealand's self-proclaimed capital of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Steampunk"]},". A festival of steampunk is held annually in Oamaru, usually during June. The town's Victorian heritage is also celebrated in a festival, held annually in November.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Car"]}," - drive three hours south of Christchurch or one and a half hours north of Dunedin on State Highway 1."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Bus"]}," - services are available from all main centres."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Plane"]}," - there are no scheduled flights, but for those who want to make the most of their time, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.noac.co.nz charter flights"]}," are available on demand for up to three passengers at a time from Oamaru Airport, 20 km north of the town."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Train"]}," - there is no passenger service."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nOamaru town is small enough to cycle around.
