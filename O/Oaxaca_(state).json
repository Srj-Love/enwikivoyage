Therefore, there's a great lack of public services in the whole state. While visiting Oaxaca, you will find a lot of roads and places in poor conditions, but people tend to be friendly if you give them nice comments about their place of origin.Regardless of the lack of services, Oaxaca has much to be proud of. Its great biodiversity and cultural heritage is reflected in having almost every type of ecosystem and many monuments from different epochs, including pyramids, churches and some new buildings in the capital city. So for an open-minded visitor, there is much to learn and enjoy in Oaxaca.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nOaxaca is known for its linguistic diversity. Many dialects are spoken in the state, with Zapotec and Mixtec being the most prevalent. Fortunately, most speakers of these dialects also speak Spanish, even if their knowledge of the language is limited sometimes, and their accent may be difficult for some native Spanish speakers to understand.\nThe government is now doing a Hispanization work in all the indigenous communities in order to guarantee the knowledge of the Spanish language by every single person in the state. In Oaxaca de Juárez it's still very common to hear indigenous people who are selling some kind of merchandice talking to each other in their native language (Zapotec, Mixtec, Chontal, etc.) However, they'll always address you in Spanish, so the English-speaking tourist should make an effort to learn at least the very basics of Spanish.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Monte Alban"]]}]}," - A 2,500 year old Zapotec city built atop a mountain outside Oaxaca City."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Pacific beaches such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Puerto Escondido"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mazunte"]]},"."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hierve del agua"]}," - A mineral spring with large travertine formations."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Santo Domingo"],["url=http:\/\/es.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Convento_de_Santo_Domingo_(Oaxaca)"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=This beautiful cathedral is a must see of Oaxaca, attached to the cathedral is a botanical garden and museum that are both worth visiting."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nOaxaca has a very rich gastronomy that offers a wide range of dishes.
