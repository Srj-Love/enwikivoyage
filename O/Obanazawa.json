Famed in Japan because it was used as a movie set for a period drama decades ago, Ginzan is a place to visit for a short period in winter when it is spectacularly covered in the metres of snow for which this area of Japan is famed or in summer for hiking in the surrounding hills.\n\nIf you visit in winter, you may be lucky enough to attend the New year festivities in mid January - when the small town comes out to celebrate the end of the old year and the incoming new year. Men and boys dress in sumo type apparell and barefeet in the freezing cold around a big bonfire - where last year's decorations are tossed in, and the town and visitors drink sake together.\n\nGinzan is a charming small town clinging to its history but with younger people resettling there. The primary school had 8 students last year (with 7 teachers!!!). In winter, there is little to sustain a visit longer than 1-2 nights but it is highly worthwhile to see how the hardy friendly and straight forward rural Japanese live. \n\nSpeaking Japanese will assist greatly - though there are groups of Taiwanese who visit and who speak no Japanese.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Obanazawa beef"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=JR Ou icon.png"],["imagesize1=100"],["directionl1=N"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Aomori"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Akita"]]}]}],["directionr1=S"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fukushima"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yamagata"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["38.6000"],["140.4000"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Yamagata (prefecture)"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Obanazawa, Yamagata"]]}]
