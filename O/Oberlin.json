North\/south streets are divided by College St (ex: Pleasant St. is divided into North\/South Pleasant by College St. There are many scenic biking trails on Oberlin's periphery that converge on Tappan Square in downtown Oberlin.\n\nDowntown Oberlin is located at the corner of Main and College. The central square, Tappan Square, is located across College St. from downtown and is a square block with corners at Main\/College Sts., Main\/Lorain Sts., N Professor\/Lorain Sts., and Professor\/College Sts. The Oberlin College campus is located just west of Tappan Square (the Student Union building, Wilder Hall, is located at 127 W.

The school is known for its liberal and progressive leanings, and the campus sees its share of drifters moving through, particularly within the Bohemian co-ops on campus. The school itself is very beautiful in the Spring and Summer. Oberlin College has always taken great pride in its architectural heritage, and visiting the campus is like seeing a slice of New York architecture in Ohio. Beaux-Arts architect Cass Gilbert designed many buildings on campus. World Trade Center architect Minoru Yamasaki designed the Conservatory. The campus features many Gothic and Victorian specimens as well, all well-preserved. Architecture buffs will be pleasantly surprised with Oberlin.\n\nThe Conservatory attracts lots of great musicians to the school, which also has a very active cultural life.
