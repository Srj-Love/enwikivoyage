Osborn, a Methodist Preacher, attended  week long outdoor holiness camp meeting in Vineland, New Jersey. Osborn's enthusiasm knew no bounds and eventually\nhe found an ideal camp meeting site, a secluded community on the North Jersey Coast, where spiritual and physical health could be renewed. On July 31,1869 a group of ministers and friends camped at what is now called Founders Park and after a candlelight prayer service dedicated themselves to establish a permanent Christian camp meeting community called Ocean Grove. From this simple beginning there would emerge a permanent town. In 1975, Ocean Grove received the designation as a State and National Historic District as an example of a 19th century planned urban community. The district contains the largest aggregate of Victorian and early 20th century structures in America. A Board of Architectural Review was established to create exterior design standards ensuring that the District would maintain its existing architectural heritage of Victorian seaside cottages.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By car "]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" From New York and points north"]},"\nNew Jersey Turnpike to exit 11 ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.state.nj.us\/turnpike\/index.htm"]},"change to the Garden State Parkway South to exit 100B to Route 33 East follow straight to end of road crossing Main Street and following to  Ocean.
