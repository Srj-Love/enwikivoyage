We love to watch the pelicans dive for their fish.  There are also a pod of dolphins who regularly patrol up and down the coast.

Right on the beach, little fish called grunion come to lay their eggs at night. They do it for 3 sequential nights every 2 or 3 weeks from March to early Fall.  The three nights are determined by the moon and tides, and the dates and times of the runs are printed in most tide guides.  The first night they start around 11:30, the next night an hour later and the third night another hour later.  To see them you will need to bring a flashlight, and should go north of the jetty, because the street lights and the North Coast Village lights make them shy.
