There are many companies that offers private transfers to Ocho Rios from the Montego Bay.

The large \"main pier\" (nearest downtown) has some facilities and many vendors just outside the secure area. The \"James Bond\" pier farther West is very industrial, with almost no services except for tour operators; it requires a substantial walk to downtown, but the sidewalk is lined with taxis.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By route taxi "]},"\nDirect route taxis are available from St. Ann's Bay and Port Maria (~J$150).\n\nTo get to Ochi from Kingston, Port Antonio or cities in eastern Jamaica, take a route taxi to Port Maria and take a route taxi from there to Ochi. Avoid saying you're going to Ochi, otherwise route taxis going to other destinations will try to grab you and you will require another route taxi to get over to Port Maria.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nRoute taxis are everywhere. To give you an idea of the local cost 120 JMD$ is the cost of a shared route taxis between Ocho Rios and Oracabessa!

Have the hotel call a taxi for you; they know the island better and you will not be put in an unmarked taxi.
