There is the vacation at the luxury hotel and resort, Complex Balnear, and there is the day at the salt lakes. No matter how long you plan to stay in Ocna Sibiului you can enjoy the rejuvenating effects of Romania’s salt lakes while relaxing in the sun. \n\nThe lakes are a product of abandoned salt mines that were abandoned  as far back as the 1700s. The lakes developed during the 1700’s and became known to the public in the early 1800’s. The resort was officially opened at Ocna Sibiului in 1858. There are three salt lakes:Horia, Closca and Crisan. One of the more popular lakes known as “the bottomless lake” has been designated a natural monument. It’s given that name for the opacity of the waters, which give the lake the illusion of being bottomless. The opacity of the water also creates a great heliothermic effect, meaning that the water traps the sun’s heat leaving the water a comfortably warm temperature. When you are submerged in the lake you can’t even see your hand under the waters.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nOcna Sibiului can be reached by bus (Transmixt) or by train from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sibiu"]]}," (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Copşa Mică"]]},"- station stop: Baile Ocna Sibiului.)
