There is a tremendous quantity of fish in the lake.  According to a Georgia Department of Natural Resources sample, there is a standing crop estimated at 355 pounds of fish per acre.  That is 250% more than any other lake in the Southeast.  Because the lake is a young impoundment, it is still peaking in number of fish per acre.  It is considered by fishermen to be the “hottest” and most fertile lake in the state.\n\nPopular game fish on the lake include large mouth, striped, and hybrid bass, black crappie, bream, and channel catfish.  Lake Oconee is the only lake in the state where the Department of Natural Resources protects the brood fish of the largemouth bass, restricting harvesting of the species in the 10” to 14” slot.  Large mouth bass are the most often sought-after Lake Oconee species, but crappie and other species of bass have a strong following.\n\nWhen the lake was formed, Georgia Power left 1200 acres of standing or topped timber to provide areas for fish to collect.  There are fifty timber areas, averaging four acres each.  They are topped at 10’ and marked by bouys.\n\nLake Oconee’s pumped storage operation positively affects fishing conditions.  When the dam is generating electricity, strong currents are created, and fish collect near the river channels.  The stable water level protects hundreds of coves where fish spawn.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Lodging"]},"\nCuscowilla Golf Resort on Lake Oconee has beautiful Golf Cottages, Lake Villas, and Luxurious Lodge Villas available for overnight rental.
