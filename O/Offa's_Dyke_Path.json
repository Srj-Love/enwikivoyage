The dyke itself (",{"type":"''","value":["Clawdd Offa"]}," in Welsh) has partially disappeared in places, although in the parts where it is preserved, it's about 20m wide and 2.5m high. In particular, there is an 130km (80mi) section between the Wye Valley and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wrexham"]]}," where the Dyke is easily seen. The route is approximately 289km (177mi) in length, and takes between 12 to 14 days. The path was inaugurated in 1971 and an estimated ??? people walk the route each year.\n\nMuch of the history of the Dyke is based on some speculation, but it is named after ",{"type":"[[","value":[[":w:Offa of Mercia"],["Offa, King of Mercia"]]}," between 757 and 796 AD. It's believed that construction was started around 785 AD but it's not known if the Dyke represented an agreed border or a defensive structure. However, some sections still form the England\/Wales border more than twelve centuries later.\n\nRelations between the Welsh and the English haven't always been comfortable.  To quote George Borrow in ",{"type":"'''","value":["Wild Wales"]},": ",{"type":"''","value":["\"It was customary for the English to cut off the ears off every Welshman found east of the dyke, and for the Welsh to  hang every Englishman whom they found to the west of it.\""]},"  Thankfully it's more civil these days.\n\nThere is much variety in the route, passing as it does through historic towns such as Knighton, Kington, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hay-on-Wye"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Monmouth (Wales)"],["Monmouth"]]},", some wide river valleys, moorlands, remote villages and woodlands.
