Almost the whole area of the islands is included in the Ogasawara National Park, which is full of beautiful nature. You can visit the marine park as well. This is an area known for whale watching. Although the access to the islands is limited to ship, it is always highly popular among tourists.\n\nOgasawara has a very diverse and rich history.

The ferry runs every three days in each direction and takes 25.5 hours one way in good weather, but longer if the sea is rough (and it often is). Please note that in bad weather the Ogasawara Maru travels at a slower speed and thus arrives at the destination late. As a result, many tourists have missed connecting trains and flights. Be sure to purchase travel insurance and to schedule your travel itinerary to compensate for this unpredictable event.

Turtle meat is a traditional island food that dates back to the early 19th Century when the island was first settled. It is considered a delicacy and in no way is prohibited under Japanese law. There are two dishes made with sea turtle meat. Kame sashimi (Turtle Sashimi) is raw meat served chilled with wasabi and soy sauce. Kame stew is preferred in the winter months where it is served hot in a light broth. Turtle meat dishes can be found at many restaurants, most notably at Kanza, Fukuchan and Como. Additionally, turtle products (canned turtle meat, turtle eggs) can be purchased at both of Chichijima's major grocery stores (Super Koiwai and Seikyo).\n\nShimazushi is the traditional island sushi. It is made from the sawara fish (wahoo in English). Sawara is sliced and lightly marinated in soy sauce. Instead of using wasabi, a dab of spicy mustard is placed under the sliced sawara and then rested on a bed of sushi rice. This traditional island sushi migrated to the Ogasawara island from Hachijojima in the 19th century, when natives from Hachijojima were sent to Ogasawara to form a colony in order to strengthen Japan's claim on the Ogasawara islands.\n\nTry the local island sushi as well, it's made from katsuo tuna and served with soy sauce and pickles.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Yankee Town"]}," has a unique style.
