During the Seven Years War (1750s), warriors from this fort attacked British colonists on behalf of the French. After the  1760 Battle of the Thousand Islands, the territory became British; in 1796, Jay's Treaty placed Fort Oswegatchie on the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United States of America"],["US"]]}," side of the border. US settlers largely displaced the Oswegatchie natives and named the village Ogdensburgh after Samuel Ogden, an early landowner. \n\nDuring the War of 1812, the city was captured by British forces; local merchants conducted extensive trade with Canada. Before the St. Lawrence Seaway (1958), Great Lakes vessels would unload grains in Prescott-Ogdensburg for transport eastward by rail.
