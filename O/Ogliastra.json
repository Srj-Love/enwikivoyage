Together, they are the administrative capitals of the recently born \"Province of Ogliastra\". Lanusei is a very ancient mountain town overlooking the valley of Ogliastra, Tortoli is a coastal settlement that reached the status of economical centre of Ogliastra thanks to the proximity of Arbatax port, the main gate to the area from the sea.\nPopulation is Ogliastra is very little, around 45000 people only, with some of the lowest densities in Italy.\nDozens of minuscule villages spot the region of Ogliastra, each one with its tradition and its proud heritage.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nItalian of course, but as well Sardinian languauge is widely spoken as in most of the Island.\nEnglish starts to be spoken among the young people, while several elder ones can be surprisingly good in German thanks to the emigration of the 60' and 70'.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nBy sea: the port of Arbatax is the classic gateway from the continent.\nBy plane: there is a small airport in Arbatax with just a few flights, only seasonal.

From Cagliari, follow the same SS125 but northbound for 1.5 hours. From Alghero you need to cross Inland Sardinia: follow first Sassari, then turn towards Nuoro and then follow Lanusei.
