Shore Road is even more coastal, connecting with Route 1 further south.\n\nDuring the tourist season, Ogunquit experiences major traffic jams on Route 1 (Main Street) and Shore Road, centered around the intersection of the two roads.  Public parking is in high demand and be quite expensive ($25\/day).  See the Town of Ogunquit website for a map of available parking lots and rates.  If driving, it is advisable to carpool if applicable, and determine where you would like to park in advance. Most overnight accommodations, like inns and resorts, provide their own free lots. Obed's Lot on Cottage Street requires advanced payment, which can be inconvenient if you do not know how long you wish to park, but which does allow you to leave without waiting in an exit line (unlike the main Beach Lot).\n\nTaking the Ogunquit Trolley between your parking lot and destinations of interest can be cost effective.  Paid dedicated motorcycle parking is available in the main Beach Lot, and is underused compared to automobile parking.  Taking public transit or parking outside of town and bicycling in would also avoid traffic hassles.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nOgunquit is said to be the most walkable community in Maine.
