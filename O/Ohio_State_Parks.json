The parks  are scattered all over the State to give access to all. To the north, the Parks around Lake Erie have some of the best beaches and camping areas. Many have boat launches. Inland, most are in forest areas and offer outstanding amenities to campers, picnickers, boaters and horseback riders.\n\nIf you are visiting Ohio, visiting any of the Parks may be a great choice at reasonable cost. Fees vary from park to park, but all are very affordable. All are open to the public.\n\nOhio has approximately 57 State Parks that provide places to sleep. Some provide year-round camping, showers, swimming, boat rental, bike rental, horse camps, sport fishing and a variety of other activities. Some of those that provide a place to sleep are listed below.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["For camping and getaway rental reservations on any of Ohio's Parks tel.
