The lake itself is over three million years old. Ohrid town is first mentioned in Greek documents from 353 BCE, when it was known as Lychnidos - or, “the city of light.” Only much later, in 879 CE, was it renamed Ohrid. The name probably derives from the phrase “vo hridi” – meaning roughly, “in the cliff.” It comes from the time when the town was limited in a small area on the lake side of the hill, which in fact is a huge cliff rising above the lakeshore. The town as we know it today was built mostly between the 7th and 19th centuries. During the Byzantine period, Ohrid became a significant cultural and economic center, serving as an episcopal center of the Orthodox Church and as the site of the first Slavic university run by St. Kliment and St. Naum at the end of the 9th century. At the beginning of the 11th century, Ohrid briefly became the capital of the kingdom ruled by Car Samuil, whose fortress still presides over the city today.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By plane "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Ohrid \"St. Paul the Apostle\" International Airport"],["alt=",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["OHD"]]}],["url=http:\/\/ohd.airports.com.mk\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat=41.174"],["long=20.740"],["directions=about 7 km from city center"],["phone=+389 46 252 820"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=The airport is open year round but most airlines only fly during the summer, so check with your travel agent or airline for most current information."]]}]},"Flights are operated between Ohrid and the following locations (although on occasional incoming flights have been known to be diverted to Skopje instead, without notice):\n:# ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amsterdam"]]}," - Mondays (28th May - 17th September), Tuesdays (12th June - 13th September) with Macedonian Airlines\n:# ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Belgrade"]]}," - inbound on Mondays, outbound on Thursdays (14th May - 27th September) with Jat Airways\n:# ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dusseldorf"]]}," - Sundays (1st July - 26th August)\n:# ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ljubljana"]]}," - inbound Tuesdays and Saturdays, outbound Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays (from 20th April) with Adria Airways\n:# ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vienna"]]}," - incoming on Fridays, outgoing on Sundays (year round) with Macedonian Airlines\/Austrian Airlines (codeshare)\n:# ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zurich"]]}," - Saturdays and Sundays (1st July to 26th August), Saturdays (year round)\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By boat "]},"\nThere is a daily boat to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pogradec"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Albania"]]},", leaves Ohrid at 10:00.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By bus "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Bus station"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat=41.124638"],["long=20.812485"],["directions=few kilometers outside of the center of town, about a 30 minute walk.
