Living a semi-nomadic life, the natives survived on wild game, berries, and the plentiful salmon runs. The first Europeans arrived in the area in 1811, and the first permanent settlement was a mission built by Father Charles Pandosy on the site of present day Kelowna. The early settlers subsisted on cattle ranching, and later, via the valley's hallmark fruit production industry. In the early 20th century many large paddlewheel steamships plied the waters of Okanagan Lake, shipping out fruit to other markets and returning goods and supplies to the many towns along the lake which were then still not connected by road or rail.\n\nToday, the Okanagan Valley has a permanent population of 297,601. The area has almost always depended on tourism, a continually growing industry fueled by the region's agreeable climate, thriving wine and fruit production, and virtually limitless opportunities for all manors of outdoor activities including boating and watersports, hiking and mountainbiking, rock climbing, camping, and fishing. The majority of tourists flock to the valley from the metropolitan regions of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vancouver"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Calgary"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Edmonton"]]},", all of which are within a days drive. The amount of international tourists is steadily on the rise, not coincidentally, in proportion to the increasingly international renown of the area's many wineries.\n\nGeographically, the region runs predominantly north-south following the course of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Okanagan Lake"]},", and is framed by mid-level mountains on the east and west sides. Highway 97, which navigates the region, follows a different valley several kilometers to the east of Okanagan Lake north of Kelowna. While the big lake is the most renowned, there are several other notable lakes in the valley including Kalamalka, Wood, Skaha, Vaseaux, Tuc-El-Nuit, and Osoyoos Lake.  \n\nWeather is generally mild in the winter, with snow at the upper elevations and rain in the lower cities. In summer the region is quite hot and dry, and in fact this region contains Canada's only ",{"type":"''","value":["true"]}," hot desert in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Osoyoos"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nThe predominant language in the Okanagan (as with the majority of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["British Columbia"]]},") is English. You may hear French accents from the many ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Quebec"]]},"ers who come to the region for seasonal work at the many wineries, orchards, and ski resorts. However, as the number one industry in the region is tourism, you may hear any world language spoken by the thousands of visitors that make their way here every year.  \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:okanagan_valley.png"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Map of the Okanagan Valley"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["From the south"]},"\n\nHighway 97 crosses the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["USA"]]},"-",{"type":"[[","value":[["Canada"]]}," border at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oroville (Washington)"],["Oroville"]]}," (USA) \/ ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Osoyoos"]]}," (CAN).

Scientists were ready to validate claims, and Lloyds of London insured the prize, but alas the bounty expired unclaimed, without even a serious contender.\n\nLike \"Nessie\" you're more likely to see it on a t-shirt or hat than you are swimming around in the deep, glacial lake, but you never know.
