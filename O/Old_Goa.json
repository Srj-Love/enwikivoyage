Full of history, it today is home to some scenic churches and convents, that are well maintained and worth a visit.

Accommodation options are limited. It's best to stay at Panjim or elsewhere in Goa, as travel within the small region tends to be easy—even if traffic jams are a growing reality due, in part, to the spurt in tourism.\n\nNearest hotels are in Panjim, though there are a few in the locality too.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\nUsually by bus.
