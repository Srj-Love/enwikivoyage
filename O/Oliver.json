While Oliver has a private taxi company, there is no public transportation system except for specialized bus services for seniors or people with disabilities.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nOliver is a relatively small town; most, if not all, of everything is within walking distance. However, you can get a private taxi service to drive you around if need be. There is the KVR trail (also referred to as the Hike & Bike path) that makes its way to Osoyoos and up to OK Falls and Penticton; it is a scenic route along the Okanagan River. Most of the route is paved and well maintained, and even the unpaved (gravel) parts are well looked after with minimal holes and obstructions. This path is definitely faster, safer and more fun to travel on than the highway, if you plan to bike or walk to any of Oliver's neighboring cities.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nMake sure to visit some of the many world class wineries while in Oliver. Oliver is home to the Golden Mile, and some of the valley's best grapes are grown here.\n\nAcross the valley from the Golden Mile is the Black Sage bench, which is home to some of the valley's most acclaimed wineries. It is renowned for its easterly position, heat, and long summer sun exposure, allowing for the production of high-quality red wines. Not all wineries in the area focus on \"big red\" wines, however. The Black Sage region of the South Okanagan is definitely a worthwhile area to tour during a stay in Oliver.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Stoneboat Vineyards-"]}," 7148 Orchard Grove Lane, Oliver BC (turn left onto Rd 9 from Hwy 97, turn left again at Orchard Grove Lane), +1 250 498-2226 ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.stoneboatvineyards.com\/"]}," Stoneboat Vineyards is a family owned and operated estate winery that focuses on premium Pinot varietals as well as Pinotage, a robust red varietal that is relatively unique in Canada.
