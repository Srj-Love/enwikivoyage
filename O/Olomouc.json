Olomouc lies astride the Morava River and is surrounded by the fertile Haná plain. It was the capital of Moravia until 1641 and is the fifth-largest city in the country, with approximately 99,500 inhabitants.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nThe first written mention of a settlement at Olomouc is almost 1000 years ago when the Kosmas Chronicle described a fortified castle watching over the important Morava river ford on the road between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kraków"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Prague"]]},". Between 16th and 19th centuries, Olomouc served as a strategically important fortress. The city today is the seat of the regional government, the Moravian archbishopric and the oldest university in Moravia, Palacky University (",{"type":"''","value":["Universita Palackého"]},"). \n\nLegend claims that the city was founded by Julius Caesar. It's unlikely that Caesar actually visited in person, but it is known that the city was originally a Roman military camp with the name Julii Mons (Julius' Hill). This name was gradually corrupted to its present form, Olomouc - which is pronounced 'Olo-mowts'. The Roman influence is a proud heritage of the city, and manifests itself in numerous areas. \n\nOlomouc is doubtless the undiscovered gem of the Czech Republic. It is home to countless beautiful buildings, great culture (home of the Moravian Philharmonic Orchestra), and hundreds of unique restaurants, bars, and pubs. Olomouc is totally off the radar of most tourists, feeling quietly normal and relaxed even on a nice day in July.\n\nAs the home to Palacky University, Olomouc is the country’s largest student city by percentage of population. Palacky University is one of the largest and most prestigious universities in the country and only Charles’ University in Prague has a longer history. During the academic year, the population of the city is increased by roughly 20,000 students, giving the city a vibrant feeling of life and energy. This is important to remember if you want to enjoy the thriving nightlife of the city - many bars and clubs depend on the student population and close for the summer vacations.\n\nOlomouc has been the seat of the Catholic Archbishop for almost 1,000 years, and thus has some of the most beautifully decorated churches in Central Europe - though they will not appear in many travel guides.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Prague"]]},": 2½h, hourly IC\/EC trains; 2h, SC ",{"type":"''","value":["Pendolino"]},"\/",{"type":"''","value":["RegioJet"]},"\/",{"type":"''","value":["Leo Express"]}," (with compulsory reservation for CZK 200) every two hours"]},"Fast trains (category ",{"type":"'''","value":["R"]},") are useless at this route, they're slower and cost the same as IC\/EC.\n\nRegular fare is CZK 324, second person in a group (of 2 or more) pays 195, extra people pay CZK 162, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Czech Republic#Train tickets"],["SporoTiket"]]}," is CZK 190.\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brno"]]},": 1½h, every two hours"]},"Beware that apart from these, there are trains Brno–Olomouc via Břeclav and the journey would be 2 hours longer.\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ostrava"]]},": 1h, IC\/EC trains every two hours"]},"Beware of some fast trains (category ",{"type":"'''","value":["R"]},") from Ostrava to Olomouc, they go longer way through Jeseníky mountains for more than 3 hours. \n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Warszawa"]]},": 5½h, EC ",{"type":"''","value":["Praha"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kraków"]]},": The only direct train is a night train ",{"type":"''","value":["Silesia"]}," arriving in Olomouc at 4:45AM.
