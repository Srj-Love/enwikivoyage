Tahtalı, the highest mountain of the vicinity and, along with some other 20-odd noticably high mountains in northeastern Mediterranean basin, known as Olympos in antiquity.\n\nA hippie haven until recently, the completion of a surfaced road from the main highway in summer 2009 means that there are ",{"type":"''","value":["many"]}," more people (including families with fussy children, and rowdy and drunk teenagers) heading there compared with only a few years past. In summer weekends when hordes of day- (and night-)trippers pour in, Olympos is sadly not much different from any ordinary resort town now. However, former habitués report that autumns when everyone else quits the scene, Olympos is just as beautiful as it used to be.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nOlympos is about 50-60 km south of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Antalya"]]},".

Follow the dusty road down past the end of the guesthouses and it leads to an ancient winding path, past the remains of ancient Greek ruins and down to the sparkling water. It's a pebble beach with absolutely no shade, so it's blisteringly hot to sit on and not very comfortable without thick padding, but the scenery is spectacular.\n\nThe ruins themselves are quite impressive, not as much so as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ephesus"]]}," but still worth seeing. The relative lack of tourist traffic compared to Ephesus means the site is largely overgrown, which gives the place a \"mystical\" feel, so you have to do some hiking to get to some of the remains. I was there in late May and it was already brutally hot, so be prepared with lots of sunscreen and water.\n\nEntering the ruins cost 5 TL\/person, and going to the beach ",{"type":"''","value":["requires"]}," entering the ruins and the staff at the gate make no distinction between someone visiting the ruins and a beachgoer, so you'll have to pay this fee each time you're going to beach, except, of course, late at night and very early in the morning, when the office is unmanned. There is also the option of buying a weekly pass which costs 7.5 TL and for 10 entrances to the ruins, and thus the beach.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nBayrams has a lively social scene, with several resident Aussies tending bar. When it's fully dark you can take a bus up to Mount Olympos, with a 45 minute hike up to the Eternal Flames of the Chimera. These flames issue from natural gas jets in the side of the hill, which will self ignite if put out. These are the flames that inspired the Greek myth of Bellarophon and the Chimera. Ranging in size from small flickers to decent size campfires, they're quite interesting when you consider they've been burning for thousands of years. \n\nGulets cruising down the coast from Antalya stop at the beach to allow their passengers to wade ashore and visit the ruins or eat at one of the many beachside restaurants.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nSince the area is under protection, no permanent construction is allowed (save for treehouses) and as such there is no formal bank in Olympos.
