For example, the Derry bus stops in Strabane, Sion Mills and Newtownstewart, while the Belfast buses stop in Dungannon and Ballygawley.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nMost of Omagh can be explored on foot. There are no trains or trams, and buses connect most of the suburbs to the town centre, but there's nothing to do there. So walking around is your best bet.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nNo visit to Omagh or the surrounding areas would be complete without dabbling in the local tradition of streetdrinking. This is usually accompanied by copious amounts of Buckfast, a tonic wine produced in Devon, but insanely popular in Scotland and Northern Ireland, as well as the Republic. Popular drinking places include the Grange Park and the Riverbank. Give it a try!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nLuigi's in Campsie has good, cheap food, and a colourful proprieter. Zio's on Main Street (called that even though you wouldn't think it was a street at all) is also cheap, and reasonably tasty.\n\nCheck out the Kamal Mahal, also in Campsie, between twelve and two in the afternoon. All you can eat lunches for a fiver, with awesome food.\n\nIn Newtownstewart just outside Omagh there is a great local restaurant called Mambojax, it concentrates on local suppliers and has an amazing menu, its a real taste of Northern Ireland.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nLots, because there isn't much to do otherwise. Omagh is a pretty expensive town to drink in. It's much cheaper to get a 'carryout' (a local word meaning alcohol bought in a shop), as bars in the town rarely have drink promotions.\n\nIf you do decide to venture out, the Embankment and the newly-opened Rue are in fierce competition for the title of \"the place to be seen\". Other pubs such as Sally O'Brien's or Top of the Town offer the usual Guinness and craic (fun) that you would expect from a bar in Northern Ireland.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["County Tyrone"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Europe\/United_Kingdom\/Northern_Ireland\/Tyrone\/Omagh\/"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Omagh"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["54.59897"],["-7.30162"],["zoom=14"]]}]
