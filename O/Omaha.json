Simply using caution and avoiding any situation in which you are uncomfortable will basically keep you out of trouble. The vast majority of violent crime occurs in North Omaha, roughly defined as the area North of Lake St, between 24th and 72nd St. Exercise a bit of additional caution when in this area after dark.\n\nOmaha is in Tornado Alley, so severe weather can erupt between the months of April and August with the main threats being hail, high winds and street flooding, but tornadoes can sometimes be a threat. Tornado alert sirens are located throughout the city. At 11AM on the first Wednesday of the month, the sirens are tested. If in doubt, ask a resident. Local stations KETV Channel 7 (ABC), WOWT Channel 6(NBC) and KMTV Channel 3(CBS) break into programming if a severe weather event is in progress. Radio services 1110AM and 590AM also provide severe weather coverage. Be aware that Omaha is within Douglas County in the state of Nebraska, as meteorologists often point out warnings this way.\n\nDuring winter months, Omaha often sees cold temperatures as well as snow or ice events. Also, be aware that steep hills do exist within the city, and precaution should be taken during slick driving conditions.  Blizzards are often possible, the entire city normally shuts down during one of these.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/omaha.com\/ The Omaha World-Herald"]}]},".
