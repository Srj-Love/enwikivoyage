The problem is the flash floods move quickly from town to town, it is easy to get trapped by washed out roads. Many wadi crossings have white and red poles to indicate when it is safe to cross the wadi in case of a flood. These are painted white on the bottom and red on top. If the water level reaches the red-painted part, do not attempt to cross, even in a 4WD.\n\nIf you managed to get a map of Oman regard it as how Oman would like to have the roads. Some roads might be drawn as well-built streets but are not even paved. Roads not being visible on the map might just end and may even be painted till the end!\n\nDistances in Oman are relatively long. The problem is the limit of kilometres of the typical rented car of 200 - 250 km per day. Prepare to pay and negotiate for extra kilometres. Monthly rates sometimes include unlimited kilometres.\n\nPetrol in Oman is very cheap by European and even North American standards. As of January 2010 the price for regular petrol was approximately OMR0.12 per litre.\n\nSince 2006, in order to try and limit the rather frightening road death toll, the motorways\/dual carriageways are littered with speed cameras.

There is a large variety in quality, from the handles to the sheath. The best handles are made of silver-adorned sandalwood, while the lesser quality handles are made of resin. Look carefully at the sheath to determine the quality of the sliver work. A good quality ",{"type":"''","value":["khanjar"]}," can cost upwards of OMR700. Typically, those will come in a presentation box, and include a belt.\n\nAnother reminder of the country's tribal past is the walking stick known as ",{"type":"''","value":["arsaa"]},". This is a cane with a concealed sword in it, which can prove quite a talking point at home. Unfortunately, in many countries, it will prove a talking point with customs officials rather than friends and family. In Musandam, the khanjar is frequently replaced by the Jerz as formal wear, a walking stick with a small axe head as the handle.\n\nOmani silver is also a popular souvenir, often made into rosewater shakers and small \"Nizwa boxes\" (named for the town from which they first came). Silver \"message holders\" (known as hurz, or herz), often referred to in souks as \"old time fax machines\" are often for sale as well. Many silver products will be stamped with \"Oman\" on them, which is a guarantee of authenticity. Only new silver items may be so stamped. There is a large quantity of 'old' silver available which will not be stamped. Although it may be authentic, stamping it would destroy its antique value. Caveat Emptor are the watch words. Stick to reputable shops if you are contemplating buying antique Omani silver of any sort.\n\nThere is a wonderful selection of Omani silver available as jewellery as well. Items for sale in the Muttrah souk may not be genuine Omani items. Instead visit Shatti Al Qurm just outside of Muscat or the Nizwa Fort.\n\nThe distinctive hats worn by Omani men, called \"kuma\", are also commonly sold, particularly in the Muttrah Souk in Muscat. Genuine kumas cost from OMR80.\n\nFrankincense is a popular purchase in the Dhofar region as the region has historically been a centre for production of this item. Myrrh can also be purchased quite cheaply in Oman.\n\nAs one might expect, Oman also sells many perfumes made from a great number of traditional ingredients. Indeed, the most expensive perfume in the world (Amouage) is made in Oman from frankincense and other ingredients, and costs around OMR50. You can also find sandalwood myrrh and jasmine perfumes.\n\nOpening hours during the holy month of Ramadan are very restricted. Supermarkets are less strict, but don't rely on being able to buy anything after iftar. At noon, most shops are closed anyway but this is not specific to Ramadan.\n\nUsing credit cards in shops is hit or miss. It is better to get cash at an ATM. Small denomination notes are hard to come by but necessary for bargaining. Unless you are in a supermarket, restaurant or mall bargaining is recommended, and this should be conducted politely.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Wahiba Sands2.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["300px"],["Wahiba Sands"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nThe food is mainly Arabic, Lebanese, Turkish, and Indian. Many Omanis make a distinction between \"Arabic\" food and \"Omani\" food, with the former being the description of the standard dishes found throughout the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nOmani food tends to be less spicy and served in quite large portions - whole fish are not uncommon at lunch in some local restaurants (sticking to local food, it is quite easy to eat a substantial meal for less than OR2). As benefits of a country with a long coastline, seafood is quite a common dish, particularly shark, which is surprisingly tasty. True traditional Omani food is hard to find in restaurants. \n\nOmani sweets are well-known throughout the region, with the most popular being \"halwa\". This is a hot, semi-solid substance which behaves a little like honey and is eaten with a spoon. The taste is similar to Turkish Delight. Omani dates are among the best in the world and can be found at every social place and at offices.\n\nAmerican fast food chains, especially KFC, McDonalds, and Burger King, are  not hard to find in the bigger cities, especially Muscat and Salalah.\n\nIn Khaboora you can get Pakistani Porotta. They are double the size of Indian Porottas and look like pappadams. But they taste like porottas and are much thinner and delicious. Three porottas are available for the equivalent of Rs11. Traditional Omani Khubz (bread) is hard to find outside of an Omani home, but for an experience one should try hard not to miss. This traditional bread is made of flour, salt and water cooked over a fire (or gas stove) on a large metal plate. The bread is paper-thin and crispy. It is eaten with almost any Omani food, including hot milk or chai (tea) for breakfast-- \"Omani cornflakes\".\n\nIn Sohar you may get an excellent lunch with Ayla curry, Ayla fry and Payarupperi. Expect to pay only OMR0.4 (Rs 44) which is considered very low lunch price here.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nBottled drinking (mineral) water is easily available at most stores. Tap water is generally safe; however, most Omanis drink bottled water and to be safe, you should too.  \n\nAlcohol is available only in select restaurants and large hotels and is usually very expensive (ranging from OMR1.5 for a 500 mL Carlsberg to OMR4). Drinking alcohol in public is prohibited, but you can get your own drinks and enjoy at public areas but in privacy such as camping by beaches, sands, mountains, or actually in any remote areas. Only foreign residents can buy alcohol from alcohol shops and with certain limits. But an alcohol black market is widely spread around the cities and alcohol can be found easily.\n\nForeigner travellers are allowed 2 litres of spirits as duty free baggage allowance. Travellers can pick up spirits at the duty free shop in the arrival lounge. \n\nDuring Ramadan, drinking anything in public is prohibited, even for foreigners. Take care to drink in the privacy of your room.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nOman has the full spectrum of accommodation - from ultra-luxurious hotels to extremely rustic huts in the desert constructed from date palm leaves. \n\nIn recent years, Oman has been attempting to turn itself into something of a five-star destination for well-heeled travellers. This does not pose a problem to the budget-minded in Muscat, and even outside of the capital there is still a range of budget options. In some parts of the country, however, accommodation may be limited to higher-end hotels and resorts.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Work"]},"\nWorking in Oman requires that you hold a residence permit.  In common with other Gulf countries, you must be sponsored by an employer to obtain a residence permit.  It's not uncommon for people to enter on a tourist visa then look for a job - this is fine.  Penalties for the employer are substantial if they are caught employing illegals, although this naturally varies depending on how good their connections are.\n\nThe majority of positions are filled by expats from the sub-continent.  Positions for Europeans tend to be restricted to upper management levels or specialised occupations, so don't expect to pick up a position as you pass through unless you are prepared to work for very little!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\nVisitors may be interested in the monthly English language lifestyle magazine, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.apexstuff.com\/ot\/index.asp Oman Today"]},", which is widely available in Oman.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nHomosexuality is a crime in Oman. LGBT tourists should be self-aware.\n\nDriving in Muscat can sometimes be a problem, although this is due more to congestion than bad driving on the part of the locals. Outside of the major cities, a common driving risk is falling asleep at the wheel due to the long stretches of featureless desert. Driving in Oman calls for attention to the unexpected. It has the second highest death rate from traffic accidents in the world (surpassed only by Saudi, followed closely by the UAE). Omani drivers outside of the cities tend to drive very fast and pass with impunity. Driving at night is especially hazardous as many drivers fail to turn their headlights on. Camels will walk into the road even if they see cars approaching, and collisions are often fatal for both camel and driver.\nFemale travellers should be careful to dress modestly, as not to offend local customs.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\nOman is warm year-round and summers can be extremely hot. Always carry drinking water with you and be wary of de-hydration in high temperatures. If you're not used to the heat it can sneak up on you and cause serious health problems.\n\nSeveral people have tried to cross stretches of the Omani desert on their own in a rented 4WD. Some of these people have died or got rescued just in time.\n\nTravelling through a desert requires proper preparation. It looks easy from a modern air-conditioned 4WD, but if that fails you are suddenly back to basics. \n\nNever go off-road alone. A minimum of two to three cars (of the same make) is the rule. Leave your itinerary with a friend with clear instructions if you do not return in time.\nTake at least:\n- recovery tools: spades, rope (and attachments), sand mats or ladders\n- two spare tires and all required equipment \n- a good air pump (high capacity) \n- sufficient water (at least 25 litres more than you think you will need for drinking) \n- sufficient petrol: there are no petrol stations in middle of nowhere. \n\nIf you have – or can get – a satellite phone, take it. (Mobiles work only in limited areas.) \nCheck your car before embarking on such a trip.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Respect"]},"\n\nAs he has done more to develop the nation than any Arab leader, or most world leaders for that matter, in recent history, Sultan Qaboos is a figure who is held in the highest regard – even revered – by the vast majority of Omanis and foreigners. Visitors should refrain from making any comments or statements that could be construed as disrespectful.\n\nThe Omanis are generally very humble and down-to-earth people. The usual rules of respect when travelling in a Muslim country should be followed in Oman, even when locals appear to be a little less \"uptight\" than their neighbours. Homosexuality is officially illegal due to Islamic law but is practised with discretion; however as elsewhere in the Gulf it is taboo to discuss such topics.\n\nWhile Omanis may not say anything to foreigners who dress in tight or revealing clothing, it is considered to be very disrespectful. Yes, some visitors push the goodwill of the Omanis in choosing their attire, but a little sensitivity goes a long way. A general rule of thumb is that women should always keep shoulders, knees, and midriff covered, and avoid tight or revealing clothing. For men, shorts should be worn only for outdoor activities; longer shorts (i.e. at or below the knee) are fine in the city.\n\nStaring is quite common in Oman; children, men and women are likely to stare at you simply for being a foreigner, especially if you travel off-season and in out-of-the-way places. This is not meant as an insult, it rather shows an interest, and a friendly smile will leave the kids giggling and showing off, and the adults happily trying out their few English phrases. Depending on which area of Oman you are in, smiling, though, may not be a good idea. In larger areas in which the locals have had excessive amounts of one on one experience with foreigners, smile-away. Outside of Muscat and Salalah, it's not advised to smile at anyone of the opposite sex regardless of how friendly they are (save for tour guides) due to the fact that nearly any interaction with the opposite gender (even holding doors open, picking up something that has fallen and handing it to the owner, eye contact, etc.) is viewed as flirtatious. It is especially important for Western women to take into account that an innocent smile saying, \"I see you seeing me, do you need something\" means \"I'm interested, come closer\" to most Omani men. They live in a heavily gender segregated society and so any chance they have to speak to the opposite gender is usually viewed as having at least semi-sexual overtones.\n\nUnder Omani law, an Omani be taken to court for insulting another person, whether it is calling them an insulting name (one of the more common Arabic insults of \"donkey,\" \"dog,\" \"pig,\" \"sheep,\" etc.) or worse. Omanis, although \"humble\" are extremely sensitive to anything they perceive as criticism whether personal, national, or anything they perceive as being directed at the Gulf. Although Saudi Arabia is usually a fair target for jokes in the Arab world (especially in the Levant), Omanis don't take well to it. What Westerners would usually consider hypersensitive is fairly normal in Oman and due largely to the fact that Omanis have grown up in an environment in which criticism and name-calling is more or less outlawed. This is especially important to know for those who come here to teach Omanis - unlike those from the Levant and parts of north Africa where teasing and intellectual \"jousting\" can be used as a form of building relationships or a sign of friendship, it doesn't work here and Omanis do not interpret it positively, save for those who have lived in the West or have worked with Westerners for extended periods of time. It might be said that teasing in general here, whether about accents, dress, food or anything else is just a bad idea.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\nThe country code for Oman is ",{"type":"'''","value":["968"]},". \n\nDialling out from Oman you will need to dial 00 + International Code + Number\n\nDialling into Oman callers use +968 followed by an 8 digit number...\n\nThese 8-digit numbers generally start with a ",{"type":"''","value":["9"]}," if it is mobile number, and with ",{"type":"''","value":["2"]}," for land lines, though other numbers will eventually start to get used.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["21.5"],["55"],["zoom=6"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Middle_East"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecountry"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Oman"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Middle East\/Oman\/"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Oman"]]}]
