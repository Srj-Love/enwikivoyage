From the mainland at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Claddaghduff"]]}," the island is inconspicuous and almost hidden.

Poets, philosophers, writers and artists have been inspired by this sensation. Omey is as much a part of the spirit of the community as the people are. This is a place of joy and sorrow, of life and death. Don’t be fooled into thinking that time stands still here. Everything is constantly moving and changing with shifting sands, water, rocks and skies. This is a mysterious place.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Read "]},"\nThe following could be of interest and are avilable from ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Clifden Bookshop"],["url=http:\/\/www.clifdenbookshop.com\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Omey Island Map + Guide + DVD; Sean Corcoran"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Connemara, the last pool of Darkness; Tim Robinson"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Connemara Wild Flowers, Introductory Guide; Dieter and Jane Stark"]},{"type":"*","value":[" The Shores of Connemara; Seamus Mac An Iomaire"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Connemara, Land of Contrasts; Clifden Bookshop"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Birds of Inishbofin; Tim Gordon"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Collins Complete Irish Wildlife; Derek Mooney"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Playing Dead.

There’s a nice shop there and a post office, beer, wine, petrol, diesel, gas and briquettes. From there you can check the tides and take in the view. Omey will come alive before your eyes. The size of the strand will become apparent if the tide is open. Be careful with the tide though, it can close with remarkable speed.

A bit closer to captivation a 26 year old donkey called Snowy patiently grazes a little field with an occasional carrot from his admirers. \n\nMake sure to get to the two rock mounds on the highest point, the eye as I call it is mesmerising. Above the lake see if you can identify Love Heart Rock not far from the poet Richard Murphy’s Octagonal Retreat. \n\nBring a kite to catch the wind or some golf balls and clubs to meander to the head. Hire a bike or there’s pony trekking locally.The landscape is ever changing; no two photographs will be the same. There is some visible history including the Sunken Church, the Holy well and ancient middens.  \n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Do "]},"\nWalking, swimming, snorkelling, fishing, bring a boat or canoe? You’ll amaze yourself at how much entertainment you can squeeze out of one little sandy island.Before long you’ll find yourself collecting yellow shells or white quartz stones. When was the last time you caught a crab? Explore the shore and rock pools at low tide. Boulder hopping, how’s your balance? \n\nWatch the sun set or the tide close or the moon rise. Simple things that we often overlook. Once a year the strand plays host to the Omey Races, an amazing spectacle. Horses, jockeys, bookies, punters and spectators come from far and wide to the temporary racetrack in the sand.\n\nThere’s not much in the way of broadband, telephone reception or TV signal so prepare yourself for DIY entertainment. I’m currently reading Tim Robinson’s new book, Connemara, the last pool of darkness which is very enlightening and the fruit of over 20 years work.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Cleggan Beach Riding Centre"],["url=http:\/\/www.clegganridingcentre.com"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+353 95 44746"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Eat "]},"\nCatch it, cook it or plunder the mainland for provisions.

If you want to spread your wings a little bit further, Cleggan is only around the corner where you can have a nice meal or take a ferry to Inis Boffin. Letterfrack is further up the road, it's a nice village close to Connemara National Park.
