Set in British India (known as the Raj) when Victoria was on the throne and Empress of India, it is one of Kipling's best known novels. \nIt is the story of Kim, whose full name is Kimball O'Hara,  an orphaned son of an Irish sergeant who is living an aimless and perfectly happy life on the streets of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lahore"]]},". He encounters Teshoo Lama, a Tibetan Buddhist monk in search of the River of Life, a conduit to his enlightenment. Kim tags along with the monk. His temporal quest to find his calling in life runs parallel to the Lama's spiritual one. During the course of the novel, Kim gets an English education and finds a way to use his innate skills in the service of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Great Game"]},", the strategic conflict the British government was engaged in with the Russian Empire for control over Central Asia. The Lama, after a few false trails, finds his River. The search takes the two of them through the plains and hills of Northern India, where they encounter a wide cast of characters. \n\nThe modern day traveller who attempts to retrace Kim's path will naturally find that much has changed, while quite a bit hasn't. Some of the train journeys that Kim took are no longer possible, because the routes now cross the international border between India and Pakistan, two countries that are in a state of conflict. The British have left, but many of their institutions endure and the people Kim encountered may dress and speak very differently from his time, but continue to be an interesting lot. Central Asia continues to be an area of conflict, though the disputants have now changed.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Infobox"],["Rudyard Kipling (1865-1936)"],["Kipling was a short-story writer, poet and novelist. He was born in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bombay"]]}," to John Lockwood Kipling who at that time taught at the JJ School of art. He was shipped to Britain at the age of 5 to be educated, and  returned to India as a teenager. His 5 years in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lahore"]]}," while Lockwood Kipling was curator of the Lahore museum were formative. He used Lahore as the base to write extensively about India. \n\nThere is no doubt of his understanding of India or his love for the Indian character, as displayed in one of his most famous poems, ",{"type":"''","value":["Gunga Din"]},". But Kipling was also an unabashed imperialist who believed in the cultural superiority of British institutions. His problematic and controversial poem ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.fordham.edu\/halsall\/mod\/kipling.asp ",{"type":"''","value":["The White Man's Burden"]}]},", encouraging American imperialism in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Philippines"]]},", is of a piece with his view that spreading the benefits of modern civilization to the less developed peoples of the world was a solemn duty, a necessary burden even, for the whites. Having said that, it is unlikely that Kipling was a racist in the modern sense - he would probably view the cultural superiority of the white people a result of historical factors rather than an innate feature of skin colour. \n\nKipling left behind a rich body of work, including great children's literature like ",{"type":"''","value":["The Jungle Book"]},", poems like ",{"type":"''","value":["If-"]},", probably the most famous depiction of British stoicism, and clearly deserved his Nobel prize for Literature.

Of course, Kim was an orphan while Kipling was not; and Kim entered adolescence speaking fluent Urdu and with barely any English, while Kipling, who moved to Britain at the age of 5, was probably proficient in the Queen's language at Kim's age. Kipling returned to India as a teenager, spent time in Lahore with his father, and clearly loved the place. He may have, through Kim, reconstructed the childhood he would have had if he had never left for Britain. \n\nKipling's portrayal of both Indian and British characters in the novel is a joy to read. Teshoo Lama's other worldliness and aversion to getting caught in ",{"type":"''","value":["Samsara"]},", the fatalism and the superstitious character of the average Indian, all reflect his deep understanding of the nation's psyche. The British people that are portrayed positively, like Creighton or Lurgan, are the ones who can have immersed themselves in Indian society and can communicate with the natives in their languages, while the ones who can't - like the two clergymen that Kim encounters - are caricatured and made fun of. In particular, Creighton is an ethnologist, much like Kipling's father who was an expert in Buddhism, and indeed Creighton acts as a kind of father figure to the orphan Kim. \n\nThe British Raj was much larger than modern ",{"type":"[[","value":[["India"]]},"; it included what are now ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pakistan"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bangladesh"]]}," together with most of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Burma"]]},".

He is on a pilgrimage to the places of the Buddha's life and to find a legendary holy river. He has come via Lahore in order to see the museum's fine collection of Buddhist sculpture.\n\nKim guides him into the museum, then listens at the door as the old man chats with the British curator. He learns of the lama's journey and that the old fellow's chela (disciple and student) died of fever in Kulu. He determines to volunteer as a new chela and join the journey, searching for his own red bull on a green field along the way. The lama accepts and Kim begins his duties as chela by begging dinner for both of them.\n\nIt is interesting to speculate on whether, or to what extent, characters in the book are based on Kipling's own experiences or on his family. Kipling himself grew up in Lahore, and his father was the curator of the Lahore Museum.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["The journey East"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:JLKipling Kim Mahbub Ali.jpg"],["thumb"],["200px"],["Mahbub Ali"]]}," \nThe lama's goal is to reach Benares (now known as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Varanasi"]]},"), the holiest city of Hinduism, and use that as a base to visit sites related to the Buddha's life such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lumbini"]]}," (where he grew up), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bodh Gaya"]]}," (where he reached enlightenment), and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kushinagar"]]}," (where he died).

Neither national government accepts the current dividing line; each claims territory currently controlled by the other.\n\nKim has a friend at the serai, a ",{"type":"''","value":["big burly Afghan"]}," horse trader named Mahbub Ali.

Like the Scots, Sikhs and Gurkhas, the Pathans resisted the English or British quite fiercely at one time and later, after being defeated, provided some of the Empire's finest troops; the Pathan regiments were all cavalry.\n\nMahbub is a Moslem like nearly all Pathans, and a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hajj"],["Hajji"]]}," who has made the pilgrimage to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mecca"]]},".

This time, Mahbub entrusts Kim with a secret message for a British officer in Umballa, now called ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ambala"]]},". On the surface, the message confirms the pedigree of a stallion, but Kim knows that is just a cover for some intrigue.\n\nThey get on train to Umballah and Kipling gives us a comic interlude with a cast of characters from all over the Punjab — a farmer and his wife from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jalandhar"]]},", a fat Hindu money lender, a courtesan from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amritsar"]]},", a Sikh soldier from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ludhiana"]]},", a Dogra soldier from around ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jammu"]]}," and various others.\n\nOn arrival in Umballah, the holy man and disciple are invited by the farmer's wife to join them in staying at a cousin's house.

A bit later, the whole regiment arrives and pitches camp.\n\nKim and the lama go back to their own camp for dinner, then return to have a better look at the military camp. Kim leaves the lama concealed nearby and sneaks in for a better look. He is caught by the regiment's Church of England padre who finds Kim's documents — his father's military discharge and masonic membership plus Kim's birth certificate — and summons the regiment's Catholic chaplain to help him figure out why on Earth an apparent thief speaks English and has these documents. Kim calls the lama to join them and explains ",{"type":"''","value":["I have found the Bull, but God knows what comes next. .... Come to the fat priest's tent with this thin man and see the end. ... they cannot talk Hindi.
