[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Caravane Marco Polo banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["itinerary"]]},"\nMarco Polo was a Venetian traveler who went far to the East, following some of the many branches of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Silk Road"]]},". He left in 1271 and returned about 1295. His book about his travels was a best-seller then and is still well-known 700 years later.\n\nWilliam Dalrymple retraced the route in the 1980s and wrote a book, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.williamdalrymple.uk.com\/Pages\/Xanadu.html ",{"type":"''","value":["In Xanadu"]}]},", about it.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" The book "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Marco-polo-hanbury.JPG"],["thumb"],["Mosaic portrait"]]},"\nMarco Polo owes his fame to a book which he wrote after his return. At the time, there was an intense rivalry between the great trading cities of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Venice"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pisa"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Genoa"]]},". The Venetian Polo and his co-author, Rusticiano of Pisa, were both prisoners of war in Genoa when they met and wrote the book.\n\nThe original title translates as ",{"type":"''","value":["A Description of the World"]},", but it is usually referred to as ",{"type":"''","value":["The Travels of Marco Polo"]},". This was the first account of a journey to the East to be widespread in Europe, and was the best reference on Asia from its publication around 1300 until the Portuguese reached the East by sea almost 200 years later. Polo's tales of the riches of the East were part of the reason for the Portuguese voyages, and also spurred on Columbus.\n\nThe book was the first in Europe to mention a number of things including oil from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Iran"]]},", and coal, paper money and window glass from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China"]]},". Some claim that Polo introduced noodles to Italy, but this is hotly disputed.\n\nThis itinerary is based on a version of the book downloaded from ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ Project Gutenberg"]},". They describe it as  \"the unabridged third edition (1903) of Henry Yule's annotated translation, as revised by Henri Cordier; together with Cordier's later\nvolume of notes and addenda (1920).\" All quotes are from that version.\n\nThere is considerable scholarly controversy about the book. It was written by two Italians, but the original was probably in medieval French, the trade language of the day. The oldest known copies are from a few decades later, several conflicting versions in French, Italian and Latin. A later Italian version contains additional material, apparently based on Polo family papers. Polo actually saw some of the things he speaks of, but for others he repeats tales from other travelers. Which are which? How much did Rusticiano, the writer of romances, embellish the story? Some critics say Marco never got East of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kashgar"]]}," and only heard tales of central China — he never mentions chopsticks, tea, bound feet, or the Great Wall. Others cite Mongol records indicating someone named Polo was indeed there.\n\nFortunately, various scholars have figured out most of this. Here, we simply follow Yule and Cordier, and discuss the route as the book gives it, ignoring the controversies.\n\nThe book generally uses Persian names for places. What about the Mongol names? Or Chinese? What was lost in various translations? In various wars? Is the city still there? Has it been renamed? We give Polo's term and the modern name. For example, Polo's Kinsay (which Yule and Cordier call Hang-Chau-Fu) is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hangzhou"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Background "]},"\nThe brothers Nicolo and Maffeo Polo were Venetian traders.

From 1260 to 1269, the brothers made a trip to the far East. On their second trip, starting in 1271, they brought Nicolo's teenage son Marco. \n\nThe family had strong ties to the Adriatic island of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Korčula"]]}," near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dubrovnik"]]},", then a Venetian possesion. It seems likely Marco was born there, though he grew up mainly in Venice. Because Korčula is trying to develop tourism, there are some Polo-related museums and monuments there. Of course, there are also some in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Venice"]]},".\n\nSome quotes from Yule and Cordier's commentary, about the political and economic situation when the Polos set out are as follows:\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Mongol empire.jpg"],["thumb"],["The Mongol Empire"]]},"\n:''Christendom had recovered from the alarm into which it had been thrown some 18 years before when the Tartar cataclysm had threatened to engulph it.

The jealousies of the commercial republics of Italy were daily waxing greater. Alexandria was still... the great emporium of Indian wares, but the facilities afforded by the Mongol conquerors who now held the whole tract from the Persian Gulf to the shores of the Caspian and of the Black Sea, or nearly so, were beginning to give a great advantage to the caravan routes.\n\n:''In Asia and Eastern Europe scarcely a dog might bark without Mongol leave, from the borders of Poland... to... the Yellow Sea.

They returned to Acre, got replies to the letters, and headed off for Kublai's court again in late 1271. They had letters from the Pope and two friars instead of the 100 scholars the Khan had requested, but the friars soon turned back. It is interesting to speculate on how history might have been different if the Pope had sent the requested 100 scholars, or even if the friars had stuck it out.

Already in the lifetime of Chinghiz himself the northern Provinces of China Proper, including their capital. Peking, had been wrenched from them, and the conquest of the dynasty was completed by Chinghiz's successor Okkodai in 1234.\n\n\"Chingiz\" is Genghis Khan. China is still \"Kithai\" in modern Russian. Another romanisation of \"Chúrchés\" is \"Jurchen\".\n\n:''Southern China still remained in the hands of the native dynasty of the Sung, who had their capital at the great city now well known as Hang-chau fu. Their dominion was still substantially untouched, but its subjugation was a task to which Kúblái before many years turned his attention, and which became the most prominent event of his reign.\n\nThe \"Sung\" are also called the \"Southern Song\". \"Hang-chau fu\" is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hangzhou"]]},".\n\n:''Kúblái received the Venetians with great cordiality, and took kindly to young Mark, ...[and] began to employ him in the public service.\n\nBy the time the Polos reached China the second time, the Khan had subjugated Southern China, which the book calls \"Manzi.\" However, he needed officials to help rule it and did not yet trust the newly-conquered Chinese.

The aged Emperor growled refusal to all their hints, and but for a happy chance we should have lost our mediaeval Herodotus.\n\nAt this time, the Mongols ruled most of Asia and the Great Khan had vassals in various places. One of these ruled Persia, today known as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Iran"]]},".\n\n:''Arghún Khan of Persia, Kúblái's great-nephew, had in 1286 lost his favourite wife... and... took steps to fulfil her dying injunction that her place should be filled only by a lady of her own kin. Ambassadors were despatched... to seek such a bride ... the choice fell on the lady Kokáchin, a maiden of 17. The overland road from Peking to Tabriz was not only of portentous length for such a tender charge, but was imperilled by war, so the envoys desired to return by sea. Tartars in general were strangers to all navigation; and the envoys... begged the Kaan as a favour to send the three _Firinghis_ in their company. He consented with reluctance, but, having done so, fitted the party out nobly for the voyage, charging the Polos with friendly messages for the potentates of Europe, including the King of England.\n\nOn the trip, they visited several of the main ports of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Maritime Silk Road"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" The great port, Zaiton "]},"\n\nThey sailed in a fleet of 14 ships with 600 passengers from Zaiton in Fujian province. The journey would take two years and cost many lives. The book says only 18 passengers survived, but all three Polos and the bride were among them. \n\nThe English word \"satin\" is thought to be derived from \"Zaiton,\" the original source for its export. It was from this port that Kublai Khan's ill-fated expedition against Japan sailed.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Marco Polo traveling.JPG"],["thumb"],["Zaiton, from one edition of the book"]]},"\nZaiton is generally thought to be modern ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Quanzhou"]]},", though some scholars argue in favour of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Xiamen"]]},". Polo's description is long and detailed. Some highlights: \n\n:''... frequented by all the ships of India, which bring thither spicery and all other kinds of costly wares. ... hither is imported the most astonishing quantity of goods and of precious stones and pearls... I assure you that for one shipload of pepper that goes to Alexandria or elsewhere, destined for Christendom, there come a hundred such, aye and more too, to this haven of Zayton; for it is one of the two greatest havens in the world for commerce. \n\n:''Many come hither from Upper India to have their bodies painted with the needle in the way we have elsewhere described, there being many adepts at this craft in the city.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Chinese ships "]},"\n\nMarco describes the Chinese ships in some detail:\n\n:''They have but one deck, though each of them contains some 50 or 60 cabins... The ship hath but one rudder, but it hath four masts; and sometimes they have two additional masts... Each of their great ships requires at least 200 mariners [some of them 300]. \n\n:''... some thirteen compartments or severances in the interior, made with planking strongly framed, in case mayhap the ship should spring a leak... the planking is so well fitted that the water cannot pass from one compartment to another. \n\nThese are much larger than European vessels of the day and the system of watertight compartments was far ahead of contemporary European methods. The Chinese routinely sailed to India, Arabia and even East Africa several hundred years before the great European voyages of discovery, and Arabs and Persians sailed to China.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" The journey West "]},"\n\nPolo did not himself visit ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Japan"]]}," but he digresses to give a fairly detailed account of \"Chipangu\" and of Kublai Khan's unsuccessful invasion attempt.\n\nThey stopped in Champa, a kingdom in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Indochina"]]}," paying tribute to the Khan. It is not entirely clear where this was, probably somewhere in modern ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vietnam"]]},". Polo decribes ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Java"]]},", but it is not clear if he actually visited it. They did stop in a city Polo calls Malaiur. This was in the area of modern ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Singapore"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Malacca"]]},", but it does not seem to have been either of those.\n\nAfter that, they spent several months in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sumatra"]]},", probably waiting out the monsoon season. Polo calls this \"Lesser Java\" and gives much detail of various kingdoms, commerce, religion and culture. They also visited the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Andaman and Nicobar"]]}," islands and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sri Lanka"]]}," en route to India.\n\nIn ",{"type":"[[","value":[["India"]]},", he visited several places on the East coast including the tomb of Saint Thomas near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chennai"],["Madras"]]},". On the West coast, the first stop was naturally ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Calicut"]]}," on the Malabar coast, now ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kerala"]]},", then along the coast to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Thane"]]}," near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bombay"]]}," and to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Khambhat"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gujarat"]]},". He describes ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sindh"]]}," but does not seem to have stopped there. He also describes several inland provinces of South India.\n\nHe describes the Indian Ocean island of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Socotra"]]}," reasonably well, then goes on to talk of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Madagascar"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zanzibar"]]}," which he gets quite wrong. Presumably he was repeating travelers' tales for these. He also describes Abyssinia, now ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Somalia"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Eritrea"]]},", but it is not clear if he went there. He also discusses ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Aden"]]},",  a city in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yemen"]]}," which was then the capital of an empire that included Somalia and Eritrea, but it is not clear if he visited there.\n\n:''This Aden is the port to which many of the ships of India come with their cargoes; and from this haven the merchants carry the goods a distance of seven days further in small vessels. At the end of those seven days they land the goods and load them on camels, and so carry them a land journey of 30 days. This brings them to the river of ALEXANDRIA, and by it they descend to the latter city. It is by this way through Aden that the Saracens of Alexandria receive all their stores of pepper and other spicery; and there is no other route equally good and convenient by which these goods could reach that place.\n\nEventually they reached ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hormuz"]]}," and continued overland to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tabriz"]]}," to deliver the bride. The planned bridegroom having died in the meanwhile, she married his son.\n\nThe Polos then returned home, sailing from Trebizond (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Trabzon"]]},") on the Black Sea to Constantinople (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Istanbul"]]},") and on to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Venice"]]}," which they reached in 1295.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Marco_Polo"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usableitinerary"]]}]
