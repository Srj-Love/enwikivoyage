The Corner Café is located on 110 Broadway in Newport, RI and you can call them at 846-0606.  They have outdoor seating along Broadway which is a relaxing experience.  I recommend getting the Fitsy’s Irish Fry Up.  It costs around $10.00 but it is well worth the price!  It is quite large so you better bring your appetite.  The fry up has eggs, black and white pudding, grilled tomatoes, bangers and hash browns making it a classic Irish breakfast.  Once your belly is full you can head over to the scenic mansions that are located along Bellevue Avenue.     \n\nWe will start the day’s site seeing by exploring the beautiful mansions along Bellevue Avenue.  The top four mansions include The Breakers, The Elms, Marble House and Rosecliff.  Each of these top four mansions provides an audio tour which gives the participant a much more enriching experience.   You can buy a Newport Mansion experience pass that will allow you to access up to five mansions.  An adult pass is $31.50 and a youth pass is only $10.00.  For more information about the mansions you can visit the Newport Visitors Center which is located on 23 America’s Cup Avenue in Newport, RI.  You can also call the visitors center at 401-845-9123 and ask them about group tours if that is more suitable to your needs.   \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Afternoon"]},"\n\nAfter having viewed the mansions it is time to get some lunch.  If you are interested in a quick bite to eat I recommend heading down to Thames Street.  Thames Street is parallel with Bellevue Avenue so all you need to do is head back to towards the Tennis Hall of Fame and take a left at the light.  This road will lead you to upper and lower Thames.  If you want specific dining, the destination Newport site has a lot of information concerning food.  Their website is Newport Food ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.destinationnewport.com\/food.asp"]}," and they have breakfast, lunch and dinner reviews and recommendations.  For our itinerary I recommend Fatulli’s because it is a great place for soups, sandwiches and desserts.  Fatulli’s is located on 909 East Main Road in Middletown, RI and they are open Monday-Saturday from 8am-5pm.  You can have a great little lunch for less than ten dollars.  They also have a build your own sandwich station which I really enjoy. \n\nAfter eating at Fatulli’s you can walk across the street to Newport Vineyards.  They have public tours from 1-3pm so it is convenient to stop by after lunch.  If you prefer going at a different time you can still visit their wine shop and have a wine tasting.  There open on Monday-Saturday from 10am-5pm and on Sundays from 12-5pm.  They sample award winning wines and have an amazing selection for the wine connoisseur.  For more information on the wine tours you can call them at 401-848-5161 or visit their website at Newport Vineyards ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.newportvineyards.com"]},".\n\t\n",{"type":"==","value":["Evening"]},"\n\nAfter visiting the winery it is time to get a fancy dinner!  I recommend the Spiced Pear which is located on 117 Memorial Boulevard in Newport, RI and is situated right along 1st Beach.  The food is fantastic and very fancy so it is going to cost a little more than Fatulli’s.  The entrée prices can range from fifteen dollars to fifty dollars so it isn’t terribly pricey if you don’t want it to be.  The best part about dining at the Spiced Pear is that after dinner you can take a walk along Cliff Walk.  At around 8pm you can watch the sun set on the water and it is quite a sight to behold.  The combination of food and great scenery makes dining at the Spiced Pear a wonderful evening.  \n\nIf you haven’t decided where to sleep for the evening you could stay at the Chanler.  The Chanler actually houses the Spiced Pear so all you have to do is walk to the front desk and ask for a room.  I recommend calling in earlier if you plan to stay because it isn’t guaranteed you will get a room.  Their website is Chanler ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.thechanler.com\/accommodations\/"]}," and has a utility that you can use to check availability and pricing.  As you will notice it is really expensive.  One room can cost $479.00 dollars so for most people this isn’t economically kosher.  There are plenty of other cheaper hotels around Aquidneck Island and can be accessed at RI Hotels ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.gonewport.com\/ViewPage.aspx?id=1"]},".  On this website there is a utility that asks your preference of places to stay.  From there you will get a selection of hotels that can help make your decision of where to stay much easier.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usableitinerary"]]}]
