A week in Sydney will help you see many of the sights of Sydney and its surrounds, and understand the city and its culture.\n \n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]}," \nThe following itinerary illustrates a few ways to spend a week in Sydney. These assume that you start from and end your trip where you are staying;  These activities, including morning, afternoon and evening itineraries, are designed to be mixed up and changed around to your likings. They do not require you to have a car.\n\nAll price estimates here do not include the prices of food, drinks, or transport between your lodging and the location of the first and last destination stated in each itinerary - for convenience, fares and travel to and from starting points is listed as if you were travelling from somewhere in the CBD and will be more expensive if you are travelling from outside that area. However, if you follow the suggestion below about the MyMulti ticket, you should not have to pay for any extra Government-run public transport at all if it is within the area of your ticket.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Prepare"]}," \nTravelling in Sydney is very easy, however, a good map will not go astray, especially when walking around the CBD area. As Sydney can get very hot and humid during late spring, summer, and early Autumn (from October-March), sufficient sun protection is advisable during these times, including SPF30+ sunscreen, a hat, and sunglasses. This is a good idea even during winter as you can still get sunburnt at those times, depending on the weather. It is also advisable that you carry a bottle of water around with you. Tap water in Sydney is very safe to drink and has no bad taste; alternatively, large bottles of water (1L or more) can be bought from any supermarket, usually for less than $2, and will be a lot cheaper than bottled water sold in restaurants or food outlets.\n\nA suggestion, to save time and money, is to buy a yellow ",{"type":"'''","value":["My-Multi"]}," (<font color=#FCB514>",{"type":"'''","value":["â– "]},"<\/font>)weekly ticket. This ticket is valid for seven days on all public transport within a given zone. Details can be found at the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.myzone.nsw.gov.au\/mymulti.html MyZone (Sydney ticketing) website"]},". For the following itinerary, it is recommended that a MyMulti3 be purchased. Although moderately expensive at $60 a ticket (for adults, concession is half price), this should cover all public transport (except monorail and private ferries) around the city within the seven days and will save you money and time from buying single tickets every time. You can buy a MyMulti2 weekly ticket that is $51, but you will not be able to travel to the Blue Mountains except by purchasing separate tickets, which are $16.40 return for an peak adult train fare and will cost you more than the difference between a MuMulti2 and MyMulti3. A MyMulti 1 ticket ($43) will restrict you to ferries and buses outside of the inner city and will not cover train travel to any of this itinerary that takes place outside of the CBD and inner suburbs.  MyMulti tickets are available at any train station, bus ticket office (though not buses themselves), or Manly or Circular Quay ferry wharf.\n\nAt Sydney Airport you can buy MyMulti tickets from the NewsLink newsagencies in T1 (International) Arrivals, and T2 (Domestic) Arrivals, but they will not include travel to or from the Airport railway stations. If you purchase them from the Airport railway stations but they will include a \"GatePass\" which will add at least $15.40 (Domestic)\/$16.20 (International) to the price of the ticket (per trip). You may want to purchase separate train tickets to the city, or for an alternative means of travel from the Airport and avoiding these fees, see the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sydney#Get in"],["Sydney"]]}," guide under the \"Get In\" section.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Day 1"]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["Morning"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:HydeParkBarracks.jpg"],["thumb"],["200px"],["right"],["The Hyde Park Barracks Museum on Macquarie Street"]]},"\nTo begin your itinerary in Sydney, we'll begin by taking a walking tour of the eastern side of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sydney\/City"],["Central Business District"]]}," to see the sights. As you have a long day ahead of you, start early, although most attractions won't open until 9am. You won't have time to visit everything here in detail, so read through here first and take your pick of attractions.\n\nTake the train on the City Circle to ",{"type":"'''","value":["Museum Station"]}," ($3.40 from anywhere in the CBD). Wait on the platform until the train has departed and admire the view - the station was built in the 1920s and was designed like a London Underground station, and is kept in the old-fashioned style, even down to the advertisements on the walls. Take the exit to Elizabeth\/Liverpool Street and walk around to ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hyde Park"]},", a green area in the middle of the city. Head towards the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au\/AboutSydney\/HistoryAndArchives\/SydneyHistory\/HistoricBuildings\/AnzacWarMemorial.asp ANZAC Memorial"]}]}," (which is free).  You can enter the building via the side entrance at the ground level.  There is a small museum to the right and ahead is a statue of a dead soldier being carried by the grieving women left behind in his life. Read the explanatory plaque, then head upstairs to the main chamber where the eternal flame burns. Exit the Memorial and walk around to the reflecting pool.\n\nWalk down the path towards Park Street, which cuts through the middle of the park. On your right across College Street, in the sandstone building on the corner, is the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.austmus.gov.au Australian Museum"]}]}," ($12 adult\/$6 children, $30 family (2+2)). This museum, which focuses on natural history, is worth a visit in its own right if you have more time in Sydney and will take a couple of hours to explore. It is a great museum for children. Otherwise, continue down the central path of Hyde Park and cross Park Street. Note the amazing canopy of trees as you walk towards the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au\/history\/waterexhibition\/OrnamentalFountains\/ArchibaldFountain.html Hyde Park Fountain"]}]},". This is a beautiful place, especially on a sunny day when rainbows form in the spray from the fountain. Head east towards the Cathedral and cross the road.\n\nEnter ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.sydney.catholic.org.au\/Cathedral\/history.shtml St Mary's Cathedral"]}]}," (free), which is the largest cathedral in Australia via the main stairs off the plaza, and have a look around. The layout of the cathedral is unusual in that it runs north-south, rather than the usual east-west. You need to purchase a photography permit from the cathedral shop before you can take photos of the interior. The crypt underneath is especially beautiful and well worth a look. You can exit the Cathedral via the shop on the left side. Head north until you reach Macquarie Street (at the north end of Hyde Park), which runs down the eastern side of the CBD.\n\nThe first building you will come to is the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.hht.net.au\/museums\/hyde_park_barracks_museum\/hyde_park_barracks_museum Hyde Park Barracks"]}]}," ($10 adults, $5 children, $20 family) which was built in 1817 and was the principal male convict barracks in New South Wales until 1848. The museum is a fascinating insight into Australia's early history and will take around 45 minutes to an hour to look around. Guided tours are available. If you don't want to pay the admission fee to the museum, you can still enter via the front door and have a look at the first room on the left, which shows some of the historical uses of the building over the years, and have a look at the museum shop.\n\nExit back onto Macquarie Street. Directly across the street is Queens Square. On the left of the square is ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.stjameschurchsydney.org.au\/ St James Church"]}]}," (which is open to the public during the daytime (free)) and on the right is the Supreme Court of NSW. The square is fronted by a large statue of Queen Victoria, facing a matching statue of Prince Albert in front of the Barracks. Look south for a magnificent view along Hyde Park's esplanade of trees, past the Archibald Fountain, towards the ANZAC Memorial. The next building as you head north along Macquarie Street is the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.hht.net.au\/museums\/the_mint\/history\/royal_mint_sydney Sydney Mint"]}]},", built in 1816, in which you are free to look around and contains a nice cafe, followed by ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.sesahs.nsw.gov.au\/sydhosp\/History.asp Sydney Hospital"]}]},". \n\nAcross the road from the Hospital is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Martin Place"]},", one of Sydney's pedestrian plazas within Sydney. It extends right down to George Street in the west of the CBD; halfway down is the fountain featured in the \"woman in red\" scene in the film ",{"type":"''","value":["The Matrix"]},". The white marble building at the top of the street on the left is the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.rba.gov.au\/Museum\/ Reserve Bank of Australia"]}]},", Australia's chief bank. There is a free museum on Australia's monetary system, accessed via the building's main lobby.\n\nFor a spot of lunch, there are a couple of cafÃ©s on Macquarie Street; alternatively, head down Martin Place to find some cheap eateries. Attached to Martin Place station (underneath the street) are the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Colonial Centre"]}," and the ",{"type":"'''","value":["MLC Centre"]},", both of which have a food court. If you have your own lunch, head to ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Domain"]}," to eat it. You can cut through from Macquarie Street by the walkway between the Mint and the Hyde Park Barracks.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Afternoon"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:BotanicGardenSydney.jpg"],["200px"],["thumb"],["left"],["The Botanic Gardens are located right on the edge of the CBD"]]},"\nOnce you've eaten, head back to Macquarie Street, and continue walking down the street on your right. You will come to a historic building with a large iron fence in front of it. This is the New South Wales ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.parliament.nsw.gov.au Parliament House"]}]}," (free), the home of the State Legislature. Free guided tours are available when the Parliament is not sitting; if Parliament is sitting and you enjoy politics, sit in on Question Time in the Legislative Assembly. It begins at 2:15pm on sitting days (check the website). Be warned - the New South Wales Parliament is notoriously rowdy and is known as the \"Bearpit\" because of the small room and the rowdiness of the politicians.\n\nOne building further on is the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.sl.nsw.gov.au State Library of New South Wales"]}]}," (free), the main library for New South Wales. The building is in two parts, the modern State Reference Library and the older sandstone Mitchell and Dixon Wing. There are often interesting historical, art or cultural exhibitions in the top floor of the State Reference Library (enter via the Macquarie Street entry), but the library is worth a visit only if to just see the beautiful Mitchell Reading Room. To access this, walk along Macquarie Street to the end of the block. Turn right and admire the sandstone entry, then enter via the main doors. The Reading Room is straight ahead. If you want to go inside, you will need to leave your bag in one of the lockers; they are accessible via the stairs that head down - just ask the attendant at the front where to go. The cafÃ© between the two buildings is good for a spot to eat.\n\nHead across the road and into the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au\/welcome_to_bgt\/royal_botanic_gardens Royal Botanic Gardens"]}]}," (free), one of three botanic gardens in the Greater Sydney area. The gardens, used originally by the Cadigal people as an initiation ground, were set aside as the Governor's private reserve shortly after the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788, and at times were used for a zoo and for a massive exhibition palace, the ",{"type":"''","value":["Garden Palace"]}," (which burnt down in a large fire in the 1880s, but the gates still survive). Today, they are the home for thousands of different species of plant found in and area the Sydney area. The gardens contain a tropical glasshouse, a herbarium and other interesting areas. There's plenty to see or do here, or you can just walk through. Take the paths that lead down to Farm Cove on Sydney Harbour.\n\nWalk up and around to the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.sydneyoperahouse.com\/ Sydney Opera House"]}]},", located on Bennelong Point. This magnificent building, one of the things Sydney is well known for, was designed by Danish architect JÃ¸rn Utzon and was completed in 1973. It contains a large concert hall, large opera theatre, several smaller halls for theatre and drama, a reception room and several restaurants, among other things. The best way to see inside the Opera House is in one of two ways - to attend a show, or to take a tour. After a couple of anti-war activists scaled the sails a couple of years ago, the Opera House massively increased its security, so there's not much to see unless you are there for a good reason. Normal tours (also available in French and German), which last for 1 hour and run between 9am and 5pm cost $35, but if you book online and in advance the price reduces by around $5. Backstage tours are also available, though they only run at 7am and cost $155, but you see a lot more than the normal tour. Tours are also available in Mandarin, Korean and Japanese ($24, 30 mins). If you don't want to go inside, just take a walk around the outside and admire the architecture. There are some places to eat and drink inside or on the western side of the Opera House underneath the main level.\n\nFor dinner, there are places to eat in and around Circular Quay, ranging from the cheap cafe to the expensive restaurant. Enjoy dinner looking out over Circular Quay.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Day 2"]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["Morning and early afternoon"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Australia_208.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["250px"],["The Queen Victoria Building, from George Street (at the Town Hall end)"]]},"\nOn Day 2, it's time to return to the CBD, this time to explore the western part of the CBD, starting at Wynyard in the north of the CBD. Like the itinerary for Day 1, you're not going to have the time to cover everything here, so start early, plan your itinerary well and select the things you like.\n\nStart at Wynyard Station, and head up to the exit at George Street (through the Wynyard Arcade). Turn right, cross at the next set of traffic lights, and keep walking until you see a large plaza area. This is the other end of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Martin Place"]}," which you would have seen yesterday. The George Street end has some historic buildings; take the time to admire the sandstone buildings. Chief among these is Sydney's ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.gposydney.com\/ General Post Office"]}]},". The entire building was formerly used for postal services; while those services still exist in a small part of the building, the remainder has been taken up by a number of up-market bars, restaurants and shops. Go inside and admire the former courtyard inside, now turned into an atrium. In front of the GPO is Sydney's ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cenotaph"]},", the site of ANZAC Day services and Rememberance Day services each year.\n\nHead one block up Martin Place (to the end of the GPO), and turn right into Pitt Street and walk until you come to the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/pittstreetmall.com.au\/index.php\/about Pitt Street Mall"]}]},". The Pitt Street Mall is the other major pedestrian zone in the CBD (currently undergoing major renovations) and contains a number of large shopping centres, containing many fashion outlets and much more. If shopping is your thing, there's plenty to do and see here. On the right, halfway down the mall is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Strand Arcade"]},", one of the original Victorian shopping arcades that used to dominate this area. At the far end of the Mall, on your left is Westfield Centrepoint, which contains the lifts to take you to the top of Sydney, in ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/sydneytower.myfun.com.au\/Buy-Tickets\/Ticket-Prices.htm Sydney Tower"]}]}," which commands fantastic views over the city and beyond ($25\/$15, up to 40% discounts available by booking online beforehand). On clear days (most of the time!) you can see out to the Blue Mountains. If it's cloudy or raining, it's probably best to skip this and come back on a day when the weather is better.\n\nIf you've finished with Pitt Street Mall, walk to the other end of the Mall (Market Street) cross Market Street and turn right until you come to the major intersection with George Street. On your way, pop into the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.statetheatre.com.au\/ State Theatre"]}]}," and admire the beautiful art deco foyer. The State Theatre puts on a number of musicals and other theatrical performances throughout the year. Across George Street you will see the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Queen Victoria Building"]}," (QVB) ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.qvb.com.au\/"]},". The original site of one of Sydney's markets, the building was almost demolished in the 1970s and replaced by a carpark. Thankfully, public reaction to that plan saw the building preserved and transformed into one of Sydney's boutique shopping centres with many of the major fashion brands having a store inside. There are also some nice cafes inside. Make sure you check out the large dome in the centre of the building.\n\nAt the other end of the QVB is the equally beautiful ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au\/sydneytownhall\/ Sydney Town Hall"]}]},". Sydney's Town Hall is one of its grand old buildings and has been recently renovated. The Town Hall is not normally always open to the public, but group tours ($5 donation) are available of the building by prearrangement; see the website for details. At times, there are recitals on the grand organ (and tours available afterwards) which are not to be missed. Next door, and open to the public during the day, is ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/sydneycathedral.com\/ St Andrews Cathedral"]}]},", Sydney's Anglican Cathedral. While much smaller than its Catholic equivalent, it is worth a look inside, and services take place regularly during the week.\n\nWhile you're walking, and you are after a spot of lunch, there are food places available in Town Hall Square, accessible from the back of the square between the Cathedral and Town Hall; this arcade links to Town Hall station from where you can find more food shops on the bottom floor of the QVB or the bottom floor of Galeries Victoria. Sydney Central Plaza also has a food court underneath the Myer department store.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Evening"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:SydneyHarbourBridgeNight.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["200px"],["Sydney Harbour Bridge at Night, what you will experience!"]]},"\nTo end off the day, we'll explore the northern part of the CBD in ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Rocks"]}," then cross the harbour as the sun sets over one of Sydney's most famous icons, the Sydney Harbour Bridge.\n\nCatch the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.sydneybuses.info\/free-cbd-shuttle.htm Route 555 Free CBD Shuttle"]}]}," to Circular Quay if you are able to (only runs until 3:30pm Mon-Wed and Friday, 6pm weekends, 9pm Thursday) north from George Street to ",{"type":"'''","value":["Circular Quay"]},", or walk up George Street until you come to the Circular Quay rail overpass. Alternatively, take the train to Circular Quay Station. Circular Quay is a busy interchange at the harbour end of the CBD, and is the terminus for ferries and buses and a busy railway station. Look up and admire the skyscrapers, especially the shorter ",{"type":"'''","value":["AMP Centre"]}," (the short one), which was Australia's first skyscraper, which now looks rather short compared to the buildings next to and behind it.\n\nFrom Circular Quay railway station, walk under the railway overpass towards George Street (as if heading towards the Bridge). When you get to George Street where the railway line disappears into a tunnel (where'll you be if you walked here), turn right through The Rocks, one of Sydney's oldest areas and full of shops and interesting places to visit. Head north towards the Harbour Bridge. When you get to Argyle Street, turn left and head uphill. Ahead of you you will see the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Argyle Cut"]},", a large opening in the sandstone cliff, carved out by convicts, which has since been covered over by the roadways of the Harbour Bridge above.\n\nOn just beyond the Argyle Cut, on the left, is a roadway heading up to Observatory Hill. This is a popular picnic spot for Sydneysiders, as well as for wedding photos. You can see why, as there is a fantastic view of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and across the harbour to Sydney's northern suburbs. If you have time, you can check out ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.sydneyobservatory.com.au\/ Sydney Observatory"]}]},", which was the original observatory for the colony, and, although now affected by the bright lights of the city, still is open for amateur astronomers and for tourists to explore its grounds.

On the Rocks side of the Argyle Cut you will see a archway with the words \"Argyle Steps\" on it. Head up those stairs, cross the road (Cumberland Street) and you will see a sign pointing to \"Bridge Steps\". Head up those steps and there will be signs showing you how to get onto the roadway. The pedestrian walkway is on the eastern side, and unfortunately you are not able to traverse the western side unless you have a bicycle. Take the walk along the bridge roadway, admiring the eastern harbour, the Sydney Opera House, and the setting sun.

The 7:21 from Central to Mount Victoria (arriving at 9:24) or the 8:24am train from Central to Lithgow (arriving Katoomba at 10:19) are recommended trains. Thr 8:24 is an express and is slightly faster than the others which stop at all stations once into the Blue Mountains. You can also pick up the train from Strathfield, Parramatta, Blacktown and Penrith stations in Sydney and may stop at other stations on some services.\n\nOn your way up to the mountains, admire the scenery, particularly as the train crosses the Nepean River into Emu Plains, then begins to head up into the mountains, also look out for the small villages which make up the City of the Blue Mountains. On your way up you may catch glimpses out of the train into the spectacular World Heritage listed valleys to the south.\n\nOnce you get to Katoomba, exit the station towards the town centre and head up to Katoomba Street. Cross the road and head for the Carrington Hotel, an old-looking grand hotel just a few doors up the hill on the right, and look for the bus stop on the street outside (the bus heads towards the station to start off with, so don't wait on the other side of the road).

Be careful as you descend - besides being steep, the stairway can be slippery if it has recently been raining, or it can be extremely windy as you descend.\n\nWhen you get to the bottom, you will be on a track called \"Dardanelles Pass\". Keep the cliff on your right and keep going. Eventually you will come to an intersection with signs to \"Federal Pass\" and a sign to the scenic railway. Turn right. You are now following the \"Federal Pass\" track, one of the main bushwalking routes through this part of the mountains.
