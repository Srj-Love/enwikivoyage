There is various entertainment ranging from live music to quiz nights and poetry nights. Visitors from all around the world come and see the Inn as it is a unique, alternative place that brews its own beers. The finest beers (take care with Monkey Puzzle) and some of the tastiest grub can be found here - and should be partaken here, as you cannot take it away, unfortunately, due to a licencing technicality to do with the only road in town being a state highway. Great place do do a little drinking, eating, making friends and listening to music.
