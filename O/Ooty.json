Ooty stands at 7,347 feet above sea level in the Nilgiri mountain range.  It was founded in the 19th century by the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United Kingdom"],["British"]]},", and served as the summer headquarters of the Madras Presidency.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nLocated in the mountainous range called the Nilgiris (\"Blue Mountains\"), it draws swarms of tourists every year. The weather is quite pleasant at a mean of 15-20°C around the year, dropping to lows of 0°C during winter. The landscape is marked by rolling hills covered with dense vegetation, smaller hills and plateaus covered with tea gardens, and eucalyptus trees. Many portions of the hills are preserved as natural reserve forests, and special permits will be needed to camp in noncamp sites. Ooty is not the destination in itself, as much as it is the focal point of attraction. Auto touring the surrounding country side is certainly a must do. Unfortunately, the hill town suffers from overcrowding and erosion of natural resources. Tourism has placed an enormous strain on the natural resources resulting in pollution, water shortage and roads.\n\nThe hilly region also houses smaller towns like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Coonoor"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kotagiri"]]},". These smaller towns are a better choice to visit and spend time in, since they are off the beaten path, yet less than 1 hour away from Ooty. They enjoy the same natural climes and prices are a lot cheaper.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nThe ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Coimbatore"]]}," airport is the closest to the hills at 3-1\/2 hours by road. There are flights into ",{"type":"'''","value":["Coimbatore"]}," from Singapore, Sharjah, Colombo and most parts of India including Mumbai (Indian Airlines, Jet and Indigo), Chennai (Spicejet, Air India, Indigo and Jet) and Bangalore. The ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mysore"]]}," airport is about 4  hours away from Ooty by road. The road trip is quite scenic from either airport.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nThe hills are connected to by a nightly train. The ",{"type":"'''","value":["Nilgiri Express (Train No. 2671)"]}," leaves from Chennai at night, and reaches Mettupalayam (which Indian Rail spells Metupalaiyam), a small town at the foothills of the Nilgiris early the next morning. The train ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Nilgiri Mountain Railway"]}," leaves Mettupalayam at 7.10 pushed by a small steam powered historic locomotive that is a remnant of Swiss engineered trains imported in the late 1800s. The steam train is much smaller, and can only accommodate a portion of the passengers that disembark at Mettupalayam.You have to book separate ticket for this journey (tickets can be booked through IRCTC(www.irctc.co.in) like any other rail ticket booking.), although many prefer the faster route of taking a cab or a bus from Mettupalayam.\n\nThe steam train takes a very scenic route, and the pace of travel will let you take in the beautiful scenery at leisure with stops at stations for the engine to take on water(the journey takes about 5-1\/2 hours compared to 2 hours by road). The train uses a rack and pinion system to haul itself up steep slopes, and also to prevent the train from sliding down when stopping. The train is pushed from behind. There are brakesmen at the rear of every carriage who will apply and release hand powered brakes individually for that carriage. The train often travels only at 5 - 10 Kmph, allowing some adventurous passengers to disembark from the train and walk along the train. This practice is ",{"type":"'''","value":["not"]}," recommended and can be dangerous, besides there is a good chance that the train will speed up, and you will be unable to get back on board.\n\nIf you don't have a confirmed ticket of that toy train then you would not get the chance to board in it as railways issue limited say only 30 tickets on the spot at mettupalayam starting at 5AM, and at 1PM at ooty for the full stretch journey from mettupalayam to ooty, and make sure that you have gained nearer position to the ticket window before it opens.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nThere are buses and shared taxi vans that can be boarded from most parts of India to Ooty. If you don't want wake up early to take the train from Coimbatore, plenty of buses are also going to Ooty. The Coimbatore \"new bus station\" has frequent bus service to Ooty via Mettupalayam, and it takes around 3-1\/2 hours to get there. However buses are not every comfortable and often crowded. The lack of air conditioning in the buses hurts till it reaches the hills. One can also avail taxi from the same \"new bus stand\".\nOn the way back in morning, some busses make a 10-15 minute stop over at Mettupalayam for breakfast. From the \"new bus station\" it takes about 25minutes by (another) bus to reach the Coimbatore railway station. From Kozhikode (Calicut) there are two government buses daily, leaving 05.00 and 07.00, travel time is about 6 hours. Mysore is served few times a day, too. From Kannur there is a KSRTC Bus starting at 7:30AM everyday and a Tamil Nadu Bus at 10PM everyday reaching ooty at 4PM and 7AM next day respectively.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nThe Nilgiris are in  ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tamil Nadu"]]},", but it is quite near the borders of neighboring states ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Karnataka"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kerala"]]},". The hills consequently can be reached from within Tamil Nadu by travelling up a heavily forested winding road, with many sharp hair-pin beds. The road trip from any state is quite scenic, although the Coimbatore-Mettupalayam-Coonoor-Ooty road (i.e. the Tamil Nadu route) is the most travelled and well maintained. All roads to the Nilgiri hills are toll roads, although the tolls are quite nominal.\n\nOne can also avail taxi from the Coimbatore \"new bus stand\", they agree to go for Rs. 2500\/- (negotiable) when reserved and Rs. 600\/- each on sharing basis, four people share an Omni (Maruti Van). In case a hotel has been per-booked, they often have contracts will taxis to provide pick-ups to and from Coimbatore for Rs 2000\/-.\n\nOoty is 284 km from Bangalore by road. The journey takes about 8 hours, depending on the condition of the road. One can take a shorter route for which a diversion has to be taken at Mudumalai wildlife sanctuary. This route will take you past the small towns of Masinagudi and Kalhatti. This route will curtail the distance to Ooty by about 50 km. Keep in mind that this road is closed at night as it passes through the jungle, so you may actually have to spend a few hours at the check post which is closed invariably at night. Only good drivers should take on this road as it is very narrow and steep.You'll find some eateries and a fuel station in the town of Masinagudi. There are some wonderful resorts around Masinagudi town where one can rent a cottage. These places are a good weekend getaway for rest and relaxation. There are eating places between Bangalore and Mysore, and within Mysore, but from Mysore to Ooty one should carry some food, as there are very few restaurants. Start early if you can so that the drive through Bandipur and Mudumalai forest can be done leisurly taking in the occasional animal sightings.\n\nDistance from ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ooty"]}," to various cities:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Coonoor"]]}," (17 km)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kotagiri"]]},"   (28 km)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Coimbatore"]]},"   (89 km)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Coorg"]]}," (225 km)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kodaikanal"]]},"    (236 km)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Munnar"]]},"     (282 km)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bangalore"]]},"    (297 km)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Calicut"]]},"   (187 km)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mysore"]]},"   (126 km)"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nTaxis, tourist cabs, auto rickshaws are available in plenty.
