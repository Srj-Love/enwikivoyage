Together Oppland and Hedmark constitute the wide interior between Oslo and Trondheim. Oppland is characterised by rows of mountains and valleys extending from the ocean accessible lowlands around Oslo up to the high plateaus and mountain peaks of central Norway. This is the highest county in Norway as 50 % of the county lies above 1000 meters, and 80 % is above 600 meters.\n\nOppland is made up of two major valley systems: ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gudbrandsdalen"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Valdres"]]},", between these there are forests, highlands and eventually ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jotunheimen"]]}," in the north-west corner.
