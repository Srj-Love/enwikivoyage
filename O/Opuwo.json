In Sept\/Oct 2009 I travelled there with work and needed a very capable guide that knew Kaokoland and knew the Himba extremely well. Western was highly recommended by some local residents and he turned out to be the perfect guide (and was wonferful company too). He comes from a Himba family and so knows the traditions, the villages and can help you get the best out of your time in Opuwo and Kaokoland. His details are: +264 (0) 812750156 and he also has an email address at westerntjiposa@yahoo.com  but as this is Africa he may only access his emails every few days.....\n\nMayor of Opuwo (Cllr Pieter de Villiers): mayor@opuwo.info or 0811222263\n\nABBA guesthouse: abbaguest@gmail.com or 0812346810\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\nMalaria area.
