The women and children were herded into the church and systematically shot. The men were rounded up into groups in the various buildings of the town and also shot to death. The town was then set alight. The ruins have been left as they stood and each building carries a brass plaque honoring those who died there. The local doctor was visiting patients outside the town and was shot as he drove back into the central square - the remains of his car still stand where it was abandoned.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nA new museum has been built underground nearby so that it does not distract from the scene and it contains many harrowing images of the massacre.
