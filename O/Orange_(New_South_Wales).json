(Somewhat amusingly, Orange is instead noted for its apple orchards.) Rather, it was named for Prince William of Orange, later William I of the Netherlands.\n\nOrange has a population of approximately 40,000 people and is one of the older towns in inland New South Wales. The one square mile village of Orange was established in 1841, and grew quickly due to Australia's first payable gold discovery in 1851 in nearby Ophir and later due to agricultural output.\n\nThe City of Orange municipality is in the centre of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cabonne Shire"]},". The Cabonne Shire consists of farmland and orchards and calls itself ",{"type":"''","value":["Australia's Fruit Basket"]},". Orange and the surrounding area are known for quiet getaways and excellent food and wine. Orange calls itself ",{"type":"''","value":["Australia's Colour City"]}," due to its large number of European trees and their autumn colours. Late March and April are the best times to visit to see the colours.\n\nOrange has a mild climate, with very comfortable summers (25℃-35℃\/80℉-95℉ during the day), cool autumn and spring weather (15℃-25℃\/60℉-80℉ during the day, falling as low as -1℃\/30℉ at night) and, for Australia, cold winters (0℃-10℃\/35℉-50℉ during the day, falling to -5℃\/20℉ overnight). Because of its elevation (862 meters\/2 828 feet) it is one of the few areas of mainland Australia other than the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Snowy Mountains"]]}," that has relatively frequent snow during winter, and it is one of the very few population centres that gets any significant snowfalls.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nOrange is four hours west of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sydney"]]}," by car. Travellers would take the Great Western Highway to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bathurst (New South Wales)"],["Bathurst"]]}," and the Mitchell Highway to Orange.\n\nOrange has several public transport links to Sydney operated by NSW Trainlink ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/nswtrainlink.info\/"]}," (tel 13 22 32). There is one direct train service in each direction daily and several bus services meeting trains at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lithgow"]]},". Train or bus from Sydney usually takes five hours.
