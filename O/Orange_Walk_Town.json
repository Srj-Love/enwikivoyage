There is a toll booth on the approach to the Town from Belize City (or simply Belize, as the locals put it).

The market area between the Corozal road and Main Street gets going early in the morning.  There are many small to medium shops and restaurants.  Do not miss the carts selling breakfast tacos.  Walking anywhere in the town is fairly safe, especially in groups, and the people are friendly and will be happy to chat.\n\nHowever walking at night, especially alone or even in pairs in not considered safe, you won't see the average local out after dark as they tend to get robbed and or assaulted.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThe best attraction in the area is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lamanai"]]},", the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mayan ruins"]}," up the river.

The menu emphasizes seafood.

You can recognize them by their perfectly tended farms.\n\n2nd Class buses (no air conditioning, and usually no \"trunk\" for suitcases) run regularly from Orange Walk to Belize City, usually no more than 2 hours one way.  From Belize City, you can connect to almost anywhere else in the country.  While avoiding Belize City is desirable, it is almost unavoidable if you want to make bus connections to other locations.\n\nDay trips to the Mayan ruins at Lamanai by boat can be arranged by the better hotels in town.  The trips typically include lunch, admission to the ruins, and a tour of the ruins in a large group with a government-certified guide.  The boat trip (if the captain isn't rushed) offers some good opportunities to see the bird life and other wildlife on the river.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Northern Belize"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Orange Walk Town"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["18.075"],["-88.558333333333"]]}]
