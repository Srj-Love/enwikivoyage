Monumental architectures line the center axis flanked by identical apartment blocks built by the dozens. Outside of China, Ordos is known as a \"Ghost City\". Whether Ordos is the way of the future or a very expansive make-work project is a question only answerable by those to come in person.\n\nSince the name \"Ordos\" can refer to both the new city and the prefecture whose centre is actually the old city, Dongsheng, things can get really confusing. Ordos (the new city) is also referred to as Kangbashi New Area (康巴什新区). Mentioning Kangbashi can remove a lot of the ambiguity when communicating with locals.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nIt is important to note that Ordos is the new city, whereas Dongsheng is the old city.
