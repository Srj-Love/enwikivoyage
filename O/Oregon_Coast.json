Hidden from view to the casual traveler, the landscape just beyond the coastal highway is radically different than the impression one gets from driving up and down the coast. The entire coast was once covered by enormous ancient rain forests, almost all of which have been logged several times over and replaced by industrial tree farms.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nU.S. Highway 101 runs along the Oregon Coast from Astoria in the north (on the border with Washington) to Brookings in the south (on the California border). The highway offers views of Pacific Ocean, making it one of the most scenic drives in the country, and runs through the heart of many coastal cities. However, from Florence to Bandon, the highway is slightly inland because of the vast Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area.\n\nThe highway is connected to Interstate 5 by many highways that run along rivers, such as the Umpqua (Highway 38). Typically it takes one to two hours to reach I-5 from the coast.\n\nThe only commercial airport on the coast lies in North Bend. The airport is serviced with daily flights to and from Portland International Airport via Horizon Air.  You can drive from the airport in Portland to the coast via Highway 26 and Highway 6 in about couple hours.  Flying into Portland is usually more economical than flying into North Bend.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nA car is the best way to get around the Oregon Coast.  U.S. Highway 101 often serves as the main drag in most of the coastal cities. Many businesses have built along 101 in an effort to attract tourists passing by. During the summer season, make sure you are not in a big hurry. It was recently named No. 1 for tourist congestion, beating out the popular Cape Cod.\n\nGreyhound no longer serves the coast, but many towns are serviced by local bus lines such as Porter Stage Coach.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nHere are just a few attractions that you need to check out on your visit to the Oregon Coast:\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Cummins Creek Wilderness Area"]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yachats (Oregon)"],["Yachats"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Oregon Coast Aquarium"]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Newport (Oregon)"],["Newport"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Yaquina Bay Light House"]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Newport (Oregon)"],["Newport"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Yaquina Head Light House And Outstanding Natural Area"]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Newport (Oregon)"],["Newport"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Sea Lion Caves"]}," (Between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yachats"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Florence (Oregon)"],["Florence"]]}," on Hwy 101)"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Sand Dunes"]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Florence (Oregon)"],["Florence"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Tillamook Cheese Factory"]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tillamook"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Tillamook Aviation Museum"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.tillamookair.com"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tillamook"]]}]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Chinook Winds Casino"]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lincoln City"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Newport Bayfront"]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Newport (Oregon)"],["Newport"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Bandon Safari Zoo"]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bandon"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Rogue Brewery"]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Newport (Oregon)"],["Newport"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Jerry's Rogue River Mailboat Rides"]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gold Beach"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Far West ATV & Dune Buggy Rentals"]}," Between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Reedsport"]]}," & ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Bend"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Cleowox Lake Kayak and Paddle Boat Rentals + Public Swimming and Picnicing Area"]}," South of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Florence (Oregon)"],["Florence"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Putt n' Bat Miniature Gold and Batting Cages"]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lincoln City"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Ripley's Believe It or Not and The Wax Works Museum"]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Newport (Oregon)"],["Newport"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Walk the 804 Trail"]}," Yachats, Oregon (also known as the Yachats Smelt Trail).
