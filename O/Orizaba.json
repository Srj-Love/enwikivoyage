However, it is possible to reach the city flying to Mexico City International airport and taking a bus directly to Orizaba from the airport.\n\nIf you know someone or are alone when travelling to Orizaba, it may be more convenient to fly into Veracruz International Airport in the city of Veracruz. The drive to Orizaba is about 3 hours long, but the roads are fairly well maintained. There are numerous car rental companies in Veracruz. \n\nThe reason for flying into Veracruz vice Mexico City is for several reasons: \n1) Traffic in Mexico City is notoriously horrible. Veracruz traffic is considerably thinner and easier to manage.\n2) The mountain overpass between Orizaba and Mexico City is extremely dangerous, with sharp turns and angles of nearly twenty degrees vertical. During the winter it is nearly inaccesible and not recommended for driving.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nGetting to Orizaba by car is easy.
