A driver with a SunPass or E-Pass transponder and a prepaid account continues straight along the road at the speed limit, with the toll accounted for electronically; drivers paying cash (almost all tourists) must follow signage that diverts them to toll booths constructed off the right side of the highway. Drivers who don't have transponders and continue going straight past the toll booth are photographed and ticketed. The fine is $100 per offense, plus tolls outstanding.\n\nSome rental car agencies use Sunpass or toll-by-plate to cover tolls, with incurred tolls charged to the customer's credit card.

You will need the license plate number and, to the best of your knowledge, note the date, time, and location of the missed toll."]]},"\n\nThe car is omnipresent in Orlando, and it is a very easy and convenient (if not congested) way to get to your destination. Orlando is a sprawling city with most attractions lying far to the south of the CBD and into adjacent cities like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kissimmee"]]},". The roads are all wide and easy to drive on with all major attractions well signed, but traffic jams around downtown are common in the afternoons, and around the touristy areas on Friday nights and all day Saturday. Orlando ranks 8th in the nation in terms of traffic congestion, and there are numerous ongoing construction projects on area expressways. Traffic information is available from electronic signs over roadways, most local radio stations, and also by calling 511 (a free, automated service which provides current traffic info).\n\nAs with most urban areas in the U.S., there are plenty of drivers who prefer to speed and drive aggressively. The Orlando area receives over 50 million visitors each year, many who drive while in town, while home to just 2 million residents. The combination of these two types of drivers can make Orlando's roads a bit hectic at times. Speed limits in the Orlando area are higher than some parts of the U.S., with a speed limit of around 45-50mph on major roads. The speed limit on Interstate 4 and tollroads is 65mph, with urban sections close to downtown posted at 55mph. Drivers in the left lane tend to drive 5-15mph faster than the speed limit. While it is the law to keep right except to pass, this is not strictly enforced.\n\nThe main highway through Orlando, and the only interstate serving it, is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Interstate 4"]}," (commonly called \"I-4\") which runs diagonally from northeast to southwest across the Orlando area. In recent years major construction on it has widened it through areas south of S.R. 528 making it a commuter-friendly highway (except for traffic during rush hours and Friday and Saturday evenings). Downtown Orlando; International Drive; Amway Arena; the Mall at Millenia; Arabian Nights dinner theater; and theme parks such as Walt Disney World, Universal Studios, Sea World, Discovery Cove, the Holy Land Experience, and Wet n' Wild are all conveniently located along\/near I-4.\n\nOther major highways include the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Beach Line Expressway (S.R. 528)"]},", a toll road known until recently as the Bee Line, which runs east from I-4 (exit 72) towards the Space Coast beaches and Kennedy Space Center, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cocoa Beach"]]},", and Port Canaveral. S.R. 528 is, like all Orlando area ",{"type":"''","value":["expressways"]}," (which doesn't include I-4), a toll road. While tolls are modest for short trips within Orlando, tolls can quickly add on long cross-town trips. Bypassing Orlando on S.R. 417 is $5.50 for 55 mi (89 km). The ",{"type":"'''","value":["Central Florida GreeneWay (S.R. 417)"]}," starts at I-4 just west of SR-192\/Disney World.

See this convenient toll calculator online: ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.expresswayauthority.com\/Corporate\/travel\/TollCalculator.aspx"]},".\n\nIn Orlando, the main tourism area is ",{"type":"'''","value":["International Drive"]},", a strip of road that runs parallel to I-4 for about 10 miles (16 km). Many tourist-focused shops, restaurants, and attractions are to be found along this road; therefore, it is excruciatingly hard to drive on and find parking along this road on weekends, especially in the summer and from Thanksgiving to New Year's Day, and excursions to this area are best by bus during such times.  Other major roads include: U.S. 192 in Kissimmee (fronted by thousands of small shops and attractions), Orange Blossom Trail (US 17\/92\/441...a North-South alternative to I-4), John Young Parkway (which can be an alternative to US-441), & S.R. 50 (E-W route towards the CBD).\n\nA few local laws to keep in mind:\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Lights on when raining"]},".

Plan ahead to have enough time before your flight to drive an extra mile or so up Semoran to the cheaper stations. There also are stations around Disney World that have similar practices.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By rental car"]},"\n\nOrlando is the largest rental car market in the world and is known as capital of car rental companies, with all major car rental companies accessible.  Operating directly within the airport are Alamo, Avis, Budget, Dollar, Enterprise, E-Z Rent-a-car, L & M Car Rental, National, and Thrifty; courtesy shuttles are available for transport to other rental companies.\n\nIf you arrive by air via Orlando International Airport and pick up a rental car there, you can go through the north exit and head to SR-528 West to get to International Drive, Universal Orlando and SeaWorld. This will require $1.75 in tolls.  Alternatively, you can take a direct route to Walt Disney World through the south exit to SR-417 South, following it to Exit 5, and taking SR 536 straight into Disney. This requires $2 in tolls.

This is a lower income area that has struggled with high crime rates. The Greyhound bus station is in Pine Hills and is a place to use caution."]},"\nWhile it is unlikely that any one individual would experience serious crime in these areas, tourists stand out in these areas, and can unwittingly do things that can make them targets for criminal behavior, so it is sensible to stay away.\n\nWhile crime in the Orlando area is not particularly high, with the annual tourists far outnumbering the regional population (~2million), a substantial amount of local crime ends up being directed at tourists. The most common crimes are theft of items from cars and hotels, so following common sense travel precautions  are particularly important in an area like Orlando.\n \n",{"type":"*","value":[" Never leave valuable items in your car unattended, and get any purchased items to your hotel room as soon as possible.

These occur nearly every day during the rainy season from mid-June through September. While some days it may only rain for 10 minutes, other thunderstorms can last for hours and its not unheard of for one location to remain dry while another spot 10 miles away gets a couple inches of rain on an afternoon. The summer thunderstorms are the main reason that Florida is the lightning capital of the western hemisphere. During these storms it is best to remain indoors due to the danger posed by frequent cloud-to-ground lightning. Golfers are especially vulnerable. A couple of dozen people are killed each year by lightning in Florida and many more spend much time receiving treatment for lightning strikes.\n\nPets are better off left with a friend or in a kennel. If you choose to bring your pet, note that most theme parks and hotels prohibit pets but may provide kennels for a fee. Most places to accommodate service animals, however.
