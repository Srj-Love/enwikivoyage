There may not be much to do in any one location, but the county as a whole offers a variety of recreational and historical attractions, all within easy driving distance of each other.\n\nThe county owes much of its tourism to the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Erie Canal"]},", which runs east-west through several communities, and to ",{"type":"'''","value":["Lake Ontario"]},", which lies to the north.  Orleans County's many creeks attract ",{"type":"'''","value":["fishing"]}," enthusiasts from throughout the region.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Albion (New York)"],["Albion"]]},", the county seat, is located close to the middle of the county, and it makes a great jumping-off point for day trips.  Albion and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Medina (New York)"],["Medina"]]}," are the largest villages; both have quaint 19th-century canalside downtowns, with light commercial strips farther out.  The other villages and hamlets are much smaller but have a number of hidden gems.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nUnlike other areas of Western New York, there were very few—if any—permanent Native American settlements in this region.  Certainly they used the high Ridge (now State Route 104) as a major transportation route, and they hunted and fished here, but the swampy land led to illness for anyone who tried to settle down.\n\nEarly European settlers also stayed away until well after other areas like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Canandaigua"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Batavia (New York)"],["Batavia"]]}," were prosperous and thriving.  In 1796, the area was included in the Holland Purchase, an enormous swath of land encompassing the every part of the state west of the Genesee River.  The land office in Batavia sold off parcels throughout the Purchase, which became known as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Genesee County (New York)"],["Genesee County"]]},".  The other counties of Western New York were split off from Genesee in turn, with Orleans being the second-to-last in 1824.\n\nThe major impetus for the settlement of the area north of the Oak Orchard Swamp was the construction of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Erie Canal"]},".  The westernmost stretch of the canal opened in 1825, and that opened up eastern markets for the products of Orleans County farms.  Only a few years later, high-quality sandstone was discovered to exist under the topsoil in the region, and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Medina sandstone"]}," was soon being quarried and exported throughout the state.\n\nManufacturing has never been as important here as in neighboring counties, due to the low population and lack of readily available power.  Instead, farming remains the county's major industry.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nThe vast majority of visitors come to Orleans County by car.  Long-distance travelers from the east and west can take the New York State Thruway to exit 48 (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Batavia (New York)"],["Batavia"]]},") or 48A (Pembroke), both in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Genesee County (New York)"],["Genesee County"]]},".  From there, you'll join the folks from the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southern Tier"]]}," heading north and take State Route 98 from Batavia to Albion, or Route 77 to Route 63 from Pembroke to Medina.\n\nFrom ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Buffalo (New York)"],["Buffalo"]]},", taking the Thruway would work, but you could also take I-990 towards ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lockport"]]},", then pick up State Route 31 which parallels the Erie Canal.  From ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rochester (New York)"],["Rochester"]]},", State Route 104 is the most convenient route, although the Lake Ontario State Parkway is quicker and more scenic if your origin or destination is farther north.  From ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Niagara Falls (New York)"],["Niagara Falls"]]},", Routes 104 and 31 are your best bets.\n\nYou could also arrive by boat, if you've got one available.  If you're coming in via Lake Ontario, there's a small marina in the Oak Orchard State Marine Park ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/nysparks.state.ny.us\/parks\/131\/details.aspx"]}," at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Point Breeze"]]},", the mouth of the Oak Orchard River.  If you come in via the Erie Canal from the east or west, you can tie up right in the heart of the county's three canalside villages: Medina, Albion, and Holley.\n\nWhile there are a number of rural airstrips scattered around the county, the only public airport is Pine Hill ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.vintageaircraftgroup.org"]}," (FAA: ",{"type":"'''","value":["9G6"]},") southwest of Albion and southeast of Medina.  Even there, don't expect much; it's got a half-mile asphalt runway, no scheduled commercial flights, and very few services.  You can fly in on a private single-engine plane, but that's about it.  Genesee County Airport ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.co.genesee.ny.us\/dpt\/airport\/"]}," (FAA: ",{"type":"'''","value":["GVQ"]},") to the south is bigger and can accommodate small jets, but still has no commercial service.  For commercial air service, you'll have to fly into Rochester (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["ROC"]]},"), Buffalo (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["BUF"]]},"), or maybe Niagara Falls (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["IAG"]]},"), then rent a car and drive in.\n\nThere's no passenger train service to Orleans County.  The nearest terminals are in Rochester, Buffalo, and Niagara Falls.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Map - Orleans County NY.png"],["400px"],["right"],["thumb"],["Map of the county"]]},"\n\nAs noted above, you'll probably want a car to get around the county.  If you need to rent one, there's an Enterprise ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.enterprise.com"]}," branch in Albion, but you're probably better off renting at the airport or train station where you came in.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Orleans Transit Service"]},", a subsidiary of the Rochester Genesee Regional Transportation Authority ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.rgrta.com"]},", does offer weekday bus transportation around and between the villages of Medina and Albion ($1 within a village; $2 between; halved for seniors and children 6-12; kids under 6 free with adult), but if you're going any farther afield, or interested in traveling at night or on weekends, you'll need a car.\n\nFortunately for drivers, the county is criss-crossed by an array of well-maintained state routes.  Routes 18, 104, 31, and 31A travel east–west, while routes 63, 98, and 237 are the main north–south routes.  104 is the primary highway, with only a few speed zones to slow you down, while 18 is a scenic lakeside route.  31 parallels the canal through Medina, Albion, and Holley, while 31A bypasses those villages to the south.\n\nOff the state routes, roads are usually paved, but they're often narrow and sometimes completely devoid of markings—even on what are nominally \"major\" connecting roads.  Nonetheless, traffic is light enough that you shouldn't have any problems.  Deer will probably pose a greater hazard to you than other motorists.\n\nThe major creeks of the county are not well-suited for boat navigation, though the stretch of Oak Orchard River immediately upstream of the dam—an area known locally as Lake Alice—is fairly placid.  The canal, on the other hand, is eminently navigable, with only a few lift bridges and no locks to delay your voyage.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Itineraries"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Oak Orchard River - Lake Alice.jpg"],["right"],["thumb"],["200px"],["Lake Alice in Waterport is a popular place for fishing and boating."]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\nThe county is entirely within Rochester's 585 area code, which was split off from Buffalo's 716 years ago.  There are full-service post offices in Medina, Albion, and Holley, with smaller offices in Lyndonville and Kendall.  The hamlets of Kent and Waterport have tiny post offices located in converted houses.
