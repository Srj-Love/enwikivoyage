It was the first major town in the area and grew enormously in the mid-19th century due to the Gold Rush, after which it slowly transitioned in to being the seat of Butte County, one of California's poorest.  Constantly overshadowed by neighboring ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chico_(California)"],["Chico"]]}," (due to the university campus there), Oroville has spent most of its post-Gold Rush existence quietly serving administrative purposes with some unfortunate race tensions in the middle of the 20th century.\n\nSince the construction of the massive dam which in turn created Lake Oroville, outdoor tourism has become one of the main draws of the town and more people have moved there as it becomes a \"bedroom community\" of towns such as Chico and even Sacramento.  Visitors to Oroville will more than likely be spending their time hiking or on the lake as the town proper, while having a nice, old historical area, isn't heavy on cultural attractions.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Historic downtown oroville.jpg"],["400px"],["thumbnail"],["Historic downtown Oroville"]]},"\nThere are three main bus methods to get to Oroville.\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Amtrak ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.amtrak.com"]}," - While better known for their trains, Amtrak does run a connecting bus service from their Sacramento hub.

While snow is extremely rare, it will often get below freezing which creates the hazard of \"black ice\" when driving.  Also to note is the period in late January or February when a longterm fog settles in for a week or two that is quite cold, but more importantly makes for very hazardous driving due to decreased visibility.
