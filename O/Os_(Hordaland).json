[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"],["pgname=Os"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Os"]}," is in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hordaland"]]}," county in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Norway"]]},". Located south of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bergen"]]},", most visitors visit on day trips from the city.\n\nThe municipality Os is situated in the southern part of Bergenshalvøya - The Bergen Peninsula - where the fjord and the coast meet. To the north Os borders on the city Bergen. Otherwise Os faces Krossfjorden, Bjørnefjorden and Fusafjorden, and borders on the municipality Samnanger to the east. The driving distance to the centre of Bergen, and also to Flesland Airport, is 30 kilometres.\n\nThe centre of Os\nOsøyro is the ancient seaside settlement that has developed into a modern centre. The centre of Os can be reached both on land and at sea. Here you can find the municipal council and most of the services both inhabitants and tourists need. The centre circles around the river mouth, and faces seafarers as well as wayfarers. \n\nPopulation\nOs has about 16 000 inhabitants. The last 100 years the population has increased steadily. This has also been the situation in the other municipalities around Bergen. Osøyro, the centre, is most densely populated. Other areas with a concentration of population are Lysefjorden, Søfteland, Søre Neset and Nore Neset.\n\nArea\nOs covers about 140 square kilometres. Towards the south and the west there are hills and open fields and a coastline with islands, bays and sounds. Towards the north-east there are rather steep fjord sides, narrow valleys and mountains with peaks as high as 850 metres. \n\nCultural life\nThe Place with Sculptures\nIn the roundabout at Osøyro, in the shopping centre, in shops, in parks and public buildings you will find sculptures in steel and bronze, marble and granite. Not like in Carrara or other famous sculpture cities, but enough to characterise Os as \"The Place with Sculptures\". A couple of excellent, local sculptors, and also the international sculpture symposium must be given credit for this. The sculpture symposium is a biennial event which has tempted artists from all over the world to spend a couple of summer weeks at Os working with chisel and angel grinder in a big tent at the banks of The Os River. They have used both Italian marble and Norwegian granite, but mostly marble. During the two weeks of the symposium each of the sculptors finishes one sculpture, and it is open for the public to come and watch the sculptors working. \nMany of the sculptures from the symposiums have remained at Os, to the great delight of both inhabitants and visitors. \nDuring the month of May 2002 the sculptor Mette Midtseter could open the first sculpture workshop in Western Norway at Lysefjorden, where she has her studio together with some other artists.\n\n\"Fritio i Os\" - \"Time off at Os\"\n\"Fritio i Os\" was first arranged in 1978. It is a great cultural event that receives the attention of most people at Os for some hectic November days. Every other year a whole week is devoted to various kinds of music and theatre: traditional concerts, plays, musicals, cabarets, jazz concerts and revues. An exhibition of arts and crafts, where the Os people can show what they are doing in their spare time, is always a part of \"Fritio i Os\". Most people involved in the cultural life at Os contribute to \"Fritio\", even if it is not possible for everyone to participate each time.\n\nMusic and theatre\nStrong music traditions, with choirs and bands at a high level, have traditionally been the most important aspect of the cultural life at Os. That is the reason why several young musicians from Os, mostly jazz musicians, have become professional. A raising star on the national rock scene is Furia, a girl band from Os that has been touring the whole country. However, brass bands and choirs - and the municipal music school for children and young people - are still the cornerstone in the local music life, from which coming stars will grow up. The municipal culture- and music school offers a versatile education in music, dance and art.\n\n\nBlues and jazz\nA weekend at the end of June is the time for the blue notes. Osøren Blues & Jazzfestival has been arranged each summer since 1999, and has attracted an imposing group of musicians at a high national, and even international level. The blues artists are mostly brought to Os from other places, while the jazz artists are generally local. They have developed their skills on the flourishing local music scene. However, the quality of the jazz concerts during the festival is still very high.\n\nArt\nAt present several artists are working at Os. Some of them are full-time, professional artists, others work on a part-time basis having other sources of income to support them. Many genres are represented by these local artists, ranging from more or less abstract installations to naturalistic oil paintings. Perhaps it is the sculptors who have reached the furthest, with works in both stone and ceramics, wood and bronze. Some artists working two-dimensional have succeeded too. About 30 artists and handicraftsmen have been organised in a network that among other things arrange an annual exhibition. \"Os kunstlag\" and the municipal culture council have for many years arranged art school for children, with courses twice a year.\n\nRose painting\nThe most distinctive art form that has a tradition at Os is rose painting. This local tradition, \"The Os-painting\", has been developed from the eighteen twenties and further on, and it is the only one of the styles of rose painting in Norway that has an unbroken tradition until today. Rose painting has traditionally been a male profession, but today it is women that carry the tradition on to new generations.\n\nSports\nAt Os there are different kinds of sporting activities with special emphasis on a few sports. Handball and football are most popular, but other sports also have strong traditions. Race walking has an exceptional position. Kjersti Tysse Plätzer’s silver medal at 20 kilometres in the Olympic Games is the greatest trophy any person from Os has ever won. Otherwise she and other athletes from Søfteland have won a lot of royal cups and other great trophies in race walking. Athletes from Os have also excelled in rowing, swimming and karate. The same goes for the brave men and women in Os Aeroklubb, flying their gliders high up in the air. Os Aeroklubb is one of the most active glider clubs in the country. Otherwise you can enjoy sports ranging from horse sports, shooting and sailing to athletics and most ball games. A recent development is the increasing interest in golf, which has led the golf club to become the biggest sports club. Bjørnefjorden Golfklubb runs a nine hole golf course at Hauge, some hundred metres from Osøyro.\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nFrom the city centre of Bergen, follow E39 south.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nBergen Airport, Flesland is the closest airport.
