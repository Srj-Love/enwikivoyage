It is located in parts of Columbia, Baker, Bradford, and Hamilton counties. The forest is headquartered in Tallahassee, but there are local ranger district offices located in Olustee.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Ranger District Offices"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Osceola Ranger District, P.O.

Spanish activities during this time centered primarily in North Florida included the development of the mission system and establishing trade with the native Floridians. The Native Americans living in the area were the Northern Utina, a Timucuan tribe.\n\nDuring the twenty-year British occupation, 1763-1783, the Osceola was included in the “land claimed by the Creek Indians.” It was not until after the Revolutionary War that individuals began to settle in the Forest establishing an agricultural based economy. Less than ten years after Florida’s entrance into the United States (1845) there were 14 sawmills around Jacksonville receiving timber harvested from the Forest.\n\nThe Battle of Ocean Pond (Olustee), fought in 1864, took placed within the Forest on the Olustee Battlefield Historic Site. During this encounter Union soldiers attempted unsuccessfully to cut off major railroad supply lines to confederate troops.\n\nThe Osceola was proclaimed a National Forest by Presidential Proclamation on July 10, 1931 and is one of 154 National Forests managed by the USDA Forest Service for the benefit of the American public.\n\nThis new “forest” had been cutover and heavily burned. A management plan was developed that focused on establishing new growth through reforestation. Fire controls were implemented to ensure the survival of the young trees. During the 1940’s a new concept, prescribed burning, was developed and managed fires began to be used to reduce the fuels and lessen the threat of wildfire.\n\nIn the 1960’s, management in the USDA Forest Service National Forests was expanded from managing primarily for timber production to include managing for range, water, recreation and wildlife, with an emphasis on the “multiple use” of forest resources. Wise stewardship has left the Osceola National Forest with an abundance of natural and cultural resources. Today the forest is managed for multiple uses on an ecological basis with the mission of “Caring for the Land and Serving People.”\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\nThis “flatwoods” forest is a mosaic of low pine ridges separated by cypress and bay swamps. It is typical of the flatwoods country with elevations ranging from 90 to 200 feet. Visitors enjoy quiet, peaceful woodlands named in honor of the famous Seminole Indian warrior, Osceola.\n\nMost of the Osceola has a high water table and poorly drained soil. Ground water normally fluctuates from 0-40 inches below the earth’s surface. Many intermediate swamps flow through the flatwoods.\n\nThe northern portion of the forest is characterized by Pinhook Swamp and Impassable Bay. These wetland ecosystems link the forest to the Okefenokee Swamp and form the headwaters of the Suwannee and St. Marys Rivers.\n\nBig Gum Swamp is a 13,600-acre Wilderness Area in the north central part of the Forest. The Osceola also has a 373-acre Research Natural Area included on the register of National Natural Landmarks.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\nVegetation on the Forest is generally divided into two types; swamps and ridges (a ridge may only be a few feet higher than a swamp.) Longleaf and slash pine, saw palmetto, gallberry, wiregrass and wax myrtle grow on the ridges. Cypress, blackgum, bay maple, ferns, mosses and briars are found in the swamps. These vegetative types provide plant species that have high value as wildlife food.\n\nThe Osceola National Forest has been known for its ability to produce high-quality timber. Remnants of old railroad grades used to move logs to sawmills crisscross the forest. Trees across the forest were tapped for resin and remnants of old turpentine camps can be found throughout the forest. The Olustee Experimental Forest was established in the 1930’s to provide research for the naval stores industry.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nThe temperatures for the dry months of November through February range from a daily average of 50F to a high of 72F. The summer season is much warmer and wetter. Short afternoon thundershowers often raise the humidity to about 90%, while the temperatures range from 80F to 95F. The average rainfall is approximately 55 inches per year.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Lodging"]},"\nThere are no hotels or motels in Osceola National Forest.
