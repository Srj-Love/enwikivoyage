It is a cosmopolitan, fast growing metropolis, and the transport hub for Norway. In 2010 it was ranked as the world's most expensive city to live in by the Swiss wealth management company UBS AG.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Stortinget 2005.jpg"],["thumb"],["500px"],["Stortinget, the parliament"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nOslo is the demographic, economic and political centre of Norway. As the capital of Norway, Oslo hosts several national institutions. The city has good selection of cultural institutions and a good selection of restaurants, some world class but most ordinary, as well as night life in general. While it is an expensive city for overseas visitors, many of the best things are free of charge, notably Oslo's proximity to wild nature and variety of outdoor activities.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Name and history"]},"\n\nThe history of the city can be traced back over 1,000 years. Oslo was founded in 1048, by the king Harald Hardråde. The city became capital of Norway around 1300, but lost its privileges during the Danish-Norwegian union from 1348 to 1814. In 1624, a fire devastated old Oslo, and the city was moved some kilometres west to gain protection from the fortress at Akershus. The new city was built in a strict grid plan that still appears modern, this area is now within downtown Oslo (between Akershus fortress and Oslo cathedral) and known as ",{"type":"''","value":["Kvadraturen"]},". The city was renamed ",{"type":"'''","value":["Christiania"]},", after the Danish King Christian IV, a name that remained until it was officially renamed on January 1, 1925 to Oslo. Traces have been found close to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ekeberg"]]}," indicating settlement as far back as 10,000 bc. After the 1624 fire Oslo\/Christiania was built exclusively form brick and stone, this gives a city clearly different appearance compared wooden towns like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bergen"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Stavanger"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Trondheim"]]},".\n\nAfter the devastating 1624 fire, old Oslo (around the mouth of river Aker) was largely abandoned and the ruins converted to farmland. Today, a few church ruins are still visible under the Ekeberg hill (across the water from the new operahouse, between road E18 and the railway). Beyond these ruins virtually nothing remains of medieval Oslo. Ironically, the new city Christiania was established outside the borders of Oslo, and 'Oslo' remained the name of the small, surviving settlement outside the new city borders. During Christiania's rapid expansion in the 19th century, as the capital of a new state, the site of original Oslo (old Oslo, or 'Gamlebyen') was included in the city. Due to the rapid inclusion of surrounding agricultural areas in the 19th century, a large number of remains from the city's farming history is still clearly visible in place names and farm houses. The remains of historical pastures can be found at parks such as St. Hanshaugen.\n\nIn 1814 Christiania became the capital of the new state under the Swedish crown. The city was still a small town with a few thousand inhabitants, notably smaller than ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bergen"]]},". During the 1800s Oslo expanded rapidly to become a big city. In 1850 there was some 30,000 people living in the city, by 1900 this had grown ten-fold, and by 1950 Oslo had more than 500,000 inhabitants. The rapid expansion in the late 1800s was particularly related to the heavy industry around Akerselva (river) - the river and waterfalls provided water and power to the factories, ship building along fjord notably what is today Aker brygge was also important. Today most heavy industry has left the city.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Geography"]},"\n\nOslo, with its approximately 453 square kilometers, is one of the largest capitals in the world by area. Granted, most of this is forest, making Oslo a city in close contact with the nature surrounding it.\n\nOslo is situated in an amphitheater-like setting, with the city centre in the bottom close to the Oslo fjord, and residential areas stretching uphill from there in all directions. Behind the residential areas, the forested area of Marka (Nordmarka, Østmarka, Lillomarka) extends, with flora and fauna that is quite extraordinary for a city of this size. Moose are commonplace (easily spotted in winter), and the whole of the capital is part of Norway's wolf reserve (even if they rarely come here).\n\nThe Oslo fjord is going northwards from the Skagerrak sea. Oslo has an impressive archipelago of islands, which in summer becomes the city's favoured playground.\n\nThe city centre is bounded by Oslo Central Station (Oslo S) to the east, the Royal Palace (Slottet) to the west and the seafront (from Akershus fortress to Aker brygge) to the south. It's fairly compact and easily walkable. Karl Johans gate, the mostly pedestrian main street connecting Oslo S and the Palace, is the main artery of downtown Oslo. However, several of the neighbourhoods close to the centre hold interesting sights and entertainment offerings, so to explore these you should make use of the city's comprehensive public transport system.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Climate chart of Oslo.svg"],["thumb"],["170px"],["Climate chart for Oslo, by month"]]},"\nAlthough well into the northern latitudes, Oslo's climate is fairly temperate thanks to warm air being wafted across the Atlantic from the Gulf Stream. Summer weather in Oslo is mild and pleasant, with frequent hot spells, and plenty of long sunny days. In winter temperatures hover just above or below freezing. Snow is most often plentiful in the forested areas and also often in the city in winter, making it a great winter sports venue. Rainfall is spread across the year, the rainiest month being August.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["People"]},"\n\nOslo proper has a population of 600,000 people, or 900,000 when including its extra-municipal suburbs (such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bærum"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lørenskog"]]},"). The Oslo metropolitan area has a population of around 1.4 million. The diverse population includes some of Norway's wealthiest celebrities and socialites, as well as more than 150,000 immigrants. This has made Oslo a highly ethnically and culturally diverse city, with 28% of the city's population having an immigrant background. Accompanied by a large influx of people from all around Norway, Oslo is thus often referred to as the \"melting pot\" of Norway. Cultural differences have affected Oslo's society and cityscape in matters of food, shopping, crime and so on, which have all blended in to the everyday life of Oslo's population. Some areas of Oslo, especially around Grønland and Tøyen, and many suburbs east of the city center, have majority-immigrant or majority non-ethnic Norwegian populations. Depending on the area, the most notable immigrant communities are Pakistani, Somali, Swedish, Sri Lankan, Iraqi, Polish, Vietnamese, Iranian, Ex-Yugoslavian, Moroccan, Turkish, Albanian, Filipino, Thai and Danish. Pakistani immigrants, and children of Pakistani immigrants form the largest minority group in Oslo.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Economy"]},"\n\nThe Oslo region is the country's premier business centre and has a diverse and dynamic economy with one of the highest regional GDPs in Europe. Figures published by the regional development agency for Oslo show that GDP per capita in the region was €44,190 ($51,950) (excluding oil and gas) in 2000, compared to an EU average of approximately €20,000 ($23,512). According to a report produced by the city's Chief Commissioner's Department and the Department of Finances and Development, the service sector dominates employment in Oslo. In 2001, Public and Business services accounted for more than 59 percent of jobs. Other major employment areas within the service sector include trade, hotels and catering, banking and insurance.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Orientation"]},"\n\nFollowing the latest reform of January 1, 2004, the city is divided into fifteen boroughs (bydeler) that are to a considerable extent self-governed. Each borough is responsible for local services not overseen by the City Council, such as social services, basic healthcare, and kindergartens. For convenience, the city can be divided into six larger districts.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Sentrum (Sentrum) Central downtown area around Karl Johan street."]},{"type":"*","value":[" West (Bygdøy) \"The Museum Peninsula\" and the poshest area in Norway"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Inner West (St. Hanshaugen, Frogner)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Inner East (Sagene, Grünerløkka, Gamle Oslo)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Outer West (Ullern, Vestre Aker, Nordre Aker)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Outer East (Alna, Bjerke, Grorud, Stovner, Nordstrand, Søndre Nordstrand, Østensjø)"]},"\nFor the short term visitor, navigation is typically related to key buildings and streets in the Central downtown area.

There are six lines, but the network is easy enough to figure out: all lines merge to one single tunnel through the city center, from Majorstuen through Jernbanetorget (Oslo S\/Oslo Central Station) to Tøyen, and then spread out into the suburbs. A loop line runs in a circle from northern Oslo city centre to the center and back. The loop line is called \"Ringen\" (the ring) in Norwegian.\n\nWith rolling stock from the 1960s, the Oslo metro used to be one of the most run-down in Europe, but it has now been fully replaced with new metro trains engineered by Siemens and designed by Porsche.\n\nWhen entering a T-bane station, make sure to pick the correct platform: all stations except three on the loop line (Sinsen, Storo and Nydalen) have separate entrances and separate platforms for trains going west and trains going east. If you have a paper ticket, make sure that it is valid (stamped) before entering the train.

The main, central tram terminal is at Jernbanetorget, where all lines converge.\n\nBus lines cover the rest of the city, as well as several ring lines.

The local trains use the same tickets as the metro, trams, and buses within Oslo and Akershus counties, but a different pricing scheme is used on journeys beyond that.\n\nSome of the cars on local trains have orange doors, with the notice \"Ubetjent\" and \"Carriage without Conductor\".

In addition to rentals, it is possible to take guided bike tours. ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.vikingbikingoslo.com"]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nTaxis are expensive. The minimum charge with most companies is at least 80NOK, increasing to a whopping 160 NOK late at weekend nights. Short central hops cost upwards of 100NOK, so if public transport still runs, use it. Taxis in Oslo as in most of Norway are frequently new, large and comfortable cars like Volvo or Mercedes. Most taxis wait for customers in a line in front of hotels or train stations, or you can order one by phoning one of the handful of taxi companies (for an extra charge). You can also flag one from the street, or go to a taxi stand.\n\nSeveral companies compete to have the most incomprehensible price structure. All taxi companies have a starting fee (0-160 NOK) and a fee per kilometer that varies from 14-30NOK. These fees vary by taxi company and time of day. Usually, there's three different rates: The lowest one is the day rate, usually between 06.00 and 18.00. The next is the evening and night rate, usually 18.00-06.00 M-F and 06.00-18.00 Sa. The last rate is usually for Saturday after 18.00 till Monday 06.00, but different companies do have different time frames. Beware that some companies will operate with a special holiday rate (helligdagstakst) on public holidays, including the night before, which will result in staggering rates.\n\nTaxi drivers in Oslo aren't a particularly jolly breed, but they usually do not speed too much, and taxi-crime towards customers is almost non-existent (towards tax authorities, however, is a different matter). Sometimes a taxi driver will attempt to charge you extra for luggage, and some companies do have a surcharge for this. The price structure should be shown on a sticker inside the car, but is always in so small print, and with an overwhelming amount of details, you can't possibly decipher it. Another thing that often disturbs visitors is that the taxi drivers' name and license is not printed inside the car itself. If you encounter any problems, ask for a receipt which will help you identify the car later, or make a note of the taxi licence number on the car roof.\n\nAll taxis accept Visa and MasterCard, and the card should be swiped in the meter at the start of the journey for card validation. The driver will usually keep the card on top of the meter so that you can keep an eye on it. If you are uncomfortable with this, it is possible to ask to get the card back, but the card needs to be swiped again when you arrive at your destination. Most meters are just swipe and sign, but some companies have EMV chip terminals where you'll need to authorize the charge with your PIN. There have been no known scams connected to credit card fraud in taxis.\n\nSome people tip taxi drivers, or round the bill up to the nearest NOK 10, but taxi drivers do not generally expect tip - most people pay the exact amount by card anyway.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nFor general information on driving in Norway, see ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Norway"]]},".\n\nThe major roads entering Oslo is also used for travel inside the city.

Normal precautionary rules apply:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Watch out for pick pockets in crowds and public transport."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Do not leave your belongings unattended."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Avoid leaving your mobile phone and wallet on café tables."]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Scams"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Common scams"]]}," occur in Oslo, and there are recent (2008) reports on the \"guessing game\" being perpetrated on the street - don't get involved in street-betting as it is certain to be a scam.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Winter conditions"]},"\nIn winter watch out for icy patches, and when wandering in the forest beware when crossing snowy clearings - they may well be frozen lakes with snow over them, which may look safe but could crack. Finally, beware of snow falling from the roofs in Oslo - there are usually red\/yellow signs upwards, and some areas are occasionally cordoned off.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Politics"]},"\nPolitics is a none-too-sensitive subject in Norway, and is often discussed in public. Like in other western countries, political views differ, and most people seem to tolerate this. There are both far-right and far-left opinions in the everyday crowd, but true extremism is rare. Pay normal attention when expressing your political opinions; violent and autocratic ideologies are generally not tolerated in Norway. In addition, being a highly diverse city, racism and sexism is generally not tolerated among most people in Oslo. In environmental policies, Norwegians have a fairly European-minded attitude when climate issues are discussed, but fewer people (including activists) will be vegetarian. Sensitive issues include the war (second world war), religion, race and the July 22nd atrocities. Environmental issues such as whaling may also be sensitive.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Water"]},"\nThe tap water of Oslo is among the cleanest in the world. Do drink tap water instead of bottled water, which does nothing but drain your pocket of much needed kroner.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Traffic"]},"\nCars are required to yield to pedestrians at marked and signed crossings, and will be heavily fined if they don't. However, this rule does not apply to trams (streetcars); the trams have the right of way.

Most people will respond in English to any question you may have. Many Norwegians also speak some German, Spanish or French, due to the proximity of the language, and that you may study it in school. Information on public transport and in government offices are often printed in English. Some bars or cafes operate in English.\n\nThe Youth information (Unginfo) runs an independent information desk in ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/use-it.unginfo.oslo.no\/ Møllergata"]}," aimed at budget travelers.
