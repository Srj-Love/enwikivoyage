Otakou means red earth.\n\nOtago was settled by Europeans in 1848. Initial settlement in the region was concentrated in Dunedin. The 1860s saw rapid commercial expansion after Gabriel Read discovered gold at Gabriel's Gully near Lawrence, and the Central Otago goldrush ensued. Veterans of goldfields in California and Australia, plus many other fortune-seekers from Europe, North America and China, poured into the then Province of Otago. Further gold discoveries at Clyde and on the Arrow River round Arrowtown led to a boom, and Otago became for a period the cultural and economic centre of New Zealand. The gold rush came and went but left its touch on the region, including a 'frontier' feeling in many of the small towns.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThere is an international airport at Dunedin.

There is an alternative option which is to take State Highway 85, which branches off from State Highway 1 north of Dunedin at Palmerston. That takes you to Alexandra (and on to Queenstown) via Ranfurly, and is an amazing scenic route (this way follows along some of the path taken by the Central Otago Rail Trail).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\t\nLike many New Zealand provinces, the landscapes and the playground they provide are the main attraction - not settlements.

The vineyards are also the highest in New Zealand at 200–400 m above sea level, on the floor of glacial valleys. Central Otago is a sheltered inland area with a continental micro-climate characterised by hot, dry summers, cool autumns and crisp, cold winters.\n\nPinot noir is the leading grape variety in Central Otago, and is estimated to account for some 70% of plantings. The Pinot Noir is notoriously fickle and difficult to grow. Central Otago, however, with its combination of climate, ",{"type":"''","value":["terroir"]}," and determined winemaking appears to have the capacity to produce a world-class Pinot Noir that is increasingly sought-after. The grape there is producing elegant wines with great ageing potential that some experts believe will ultimately equal the best in the world.\n\nThe other 30% of production comes from Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc, Riesling, Pinot gris, and Gewürztraminer. The latter three in particular, amenable to Central Otago's climatic conditions and soil type, are showing great promise, and may develop a reputation to match the Pinot Noirs. Limited production of sparkling wine, made in the traditional style from Pinot Noir and Chardonnay grapes, has been of good quality, and has received some accolades at wine tastings around the world.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nUnlike the more northerly parts of New Zealand, parts of Otago often gets snow in winter.
