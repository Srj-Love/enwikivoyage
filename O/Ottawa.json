The metropolitan population of Ottawa is 1.1 million and it is currently the fourth largest city in Canada, and the second largest in Ontario after Toronto.\n\nUnique as a North American capital, the city is bilingual.

Staff in most stores and restaurants speak both well and, in general, bilingualism is common.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Parliament hill flag.jpg"],["thumb"],["350px"],["The Peace Tower, Parliament Hill"]]},"\nOttawa is home to many of the world's cultures as thousands of immigrants from around the world now call Ottawa home.

Lumber mills were built along the Ottawa River in the mid-nineteenth century and those brought employment and wealth to the growing population. The centre of action then, as now, was the ByWard Market. While it's still the centre of the city's nightlife, it has changed appreciably from the rough and tumble early days of brothels and taverns.\n\nIn 1857, Queen Victoria chose Ottawa as the capital of Canada. The choice was controversial, partly because it sidestepped the rivalry between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Toronto"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Montreal"]]}," (then, as now, Canada's largest cities), and partly because the new capital was still a tiny outpost in the middle of nothing much â€” an American newspaper famously commented that it was impregnable, as any invaders would get lost in the woods looking for it.\n\nDuring the latter half of the nineteenth century, the telephone was demonstrated to the Canadian public for the first time and the city was electrified. The first electric streetcar service was started in 1891. A menu from 1892 states that, \"the first instance in the entire world of an entire meal being cooked by Electricity\" was in Ottawa.\n\nToday, the major economic sectors are the public service, travel and tourism and the high-tech industry. Ottawa has proudly remained a green city and is situated at the confluence of three rivers (Ottawa, Rideau and Gatineau) as well as the Rideau canal. Many residents make regular use of Ottawa's parks and green spaces, bikeways and cross country ski trails. Many national attractions are located in Ottawa: Parliament Hill; the National Library and Archives; the National Gallery; as well as the Museums of Civilization, Contemporary Photography, Nature, War and Science & Technology.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh = -6"],["febhigh = -4"],["marhigh = 2"],["aprhigh = 11"],["mayhigh = 19"],["junhigh = 24"],["julhigh = 26"],["aughigh = 25"],["sephigh = 20"],["octhigh = 13"],["novhigh = 5"],["dechigh = -3"],["janlow = -15"],["feblow = -13"],["marlow = -7"],["aprlow = 1"],["maylow = 8"],["junlow = 13"],["jullow = 16"],["auglow = 14"],["seplow = 10"],["octlow = 4"],["novlow = -2"],["declow = -10"],["janprecip = 64"],["febprecip = 52"],["marprecip = 65"],["aprprecip = 68"],["mayprecip = 81"],["junprecip = 91"],["julprecip = 89"],["augprecip = 88"],["sepprecip = 87"],["octprecip = 79"],["novprecip = 77"],["decprecip = 74"],["description = See the Ottawa 7 day forecast at ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/weatheroffice.gc.ca\/city\/pages\/on-118_metric_e.html Environment Canada"]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Visitor information"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Capital Information Kiosk"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.ottawatourism.ca"],["email="],["address=at 111 Albert Street at Metcalfe"],["lat=45.42163"],["long=-75.69664"],["directions=in the World Exchange Plaza"],["phone=+1 613 239-5000"],["tollfree=+1-800-465-1867"],["fax="],["hours=10AM-5PM daily"],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nThe newly renovated and expanded ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/ottawa-airport.ca Macdonald-Cartier International Airport"]}]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["YOW"]]},") is Ottawa's main airport with regular arrivals and departures from most major Canadian and many American cities.

The bus terminal is downtown on the corner of Catherine Street and Kent Street, between Bronson Avenue and Bank Street. Though the bus terminal is downtown, a 15-20 minute walk will get you to most hotels and downtown attractions. Alternatively, a 5-10 minute local bus ride will do the same. (Bus #4, with its stop around the corner from the terminal on Kent Street, is the bus that you will want to take.)\n\nGreyhound busses coming from Montreal also usually make an intermediary \"University of Ottawa\" stop (actually at Laurier Station near the corner of Laurier Avenue East and Waller Street) before going to the Catherine Street terminal.

Tickets cost $1.30 each and are available from local stores in sheets of six (but some stores will sell smaller numbers at a time). Children 6 to 11 years of age require only one ticket. Upon boarding, make sure that you are given a transfer, which allows you to ride any number of buses or trains until its expiry (in roughly 1.5 hours).  The transfer is also your proof of payment in case fare enforcers board the bus to check that passengers have paid.  A day pass can be purchased on any bus for $7.75 and is good for both buses and the train. On Sundays, families (up to two adults and four children, age 11 and under) can share a day pass. \n\nThe O-Train operates on a \"Proof of Payment\" (POP) system. Valid proof of payment is a bus transfer (see above), or an O-Train ticket purchased from the automated vending machines for $2.75.  Note that the vending machine does not accept bus tickets, nor are bus tickets acceptable proof of payment.  Children 11 and under can ride the O-Train for free. Articulated buses (the long ones) use this same POP system as well, where rear boarding is available to pass holders.\n\nAlthough the downtown is very walkable, if you are within the downtown area (Lebreton station to Campus station), you can take any bus going east-west. If you are going to the Byward Market from the Transitway (#95, #96, #97, #85, #86, #87), get off at Rideau Centre and walk through the mall to the other end.

Most cab drivers know Ottawa well, but have clear instructions if you're going anywhere in the suburbs as many developments in the outskirts are relatively new.

There are many tourists in the city, especially in summer months, and there are very few incidents of robbery or assault.\n\nThat said, buses and transit stations have had issues in recent years with violence and swarmings\/robberies, even during daytime hours. OC Transpo has hired new constables and placed plainclothes security as well as cameras on select buses and trains to counter the problem. Use common sense, especially when riding at night, every transit station has multiple emergency call boxes.  After dark, take extra care in areas near downtown such as Lowertown, and also Hintonburg, Vanier, Bayshore, Ledbury, Heatherington, Caldwell and South Keys. These neighbourhoods are known to have gang presence, and drug problems. The section of Rideau Street between Sussex Drive and King Edward Avenue is infamous for its homelessness and panhandling, though this rarely causes problems for anyone. Ottawa is generally very safe, but like any other city it has bad apples.\n\nOttawa is the fourth coldest capital city by annual average temperature, but it has the second coldest January, only topped by Ulan Bator, Mongolia. Add to that nearly 3m (10') of snow per average winter and throw in an ice storm from time to time, winter can be a challenge but locals do a great job of handling it particularly with recreation. Summers are (normally) short, hot and humid. Humidity in the summer can make the heat feel quite aggressive, while in the winter, humidity, coupled with wind chills, can make the cold feel very brutal.
