This is also where the greatest concentration of people reside in the region.  Although not synonymous, the Ottawa Valley is closely associated with Renfrew County as the towns most closely associated with the valley (Arnprior, Renfrew and Pembroke) are all located there, on or near the river.\n\nAcross the river is the Quebec region of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Outaouais"]]}," (Ottawa in French). We treat that in a separate article but parts of it, especially the historically English-speaking towns near the river such as Aylmer (now part of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gatineau"]]},") are very similar to places on the Ontario side of the river.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Renfrew County"]},"\nRenfrew County is a region with no city, but with several medium sized towns and townships.  The largest of these are Petawawa, Renfrew, Arnprior and Pembroke.  You may hear locals refer to Renfrew and Arnprior as \"the Frew\" or \"the Prior\". Numerous villages are present in Renfrew Country and often are linked to the nearby tourism. \n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Arnprior"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Barry's Bay"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Calabogie"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Combermere"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Deep River"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Eganville"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Killaloe (Ontario)"],["Killaloe"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Algona Wilberforce"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pembroke (Ontario)"],["Pembroke"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Petawawa"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Renfrew"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wilno"]]}," - First and oldest Polish settlement in the country."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\nWhile there is not a substantially-sized park within Renfrew County, Algonquin Park  borders much of the region to the west. The Ottawa Valley itself is largely cottage country (forming a sort of transition area between cottage owners from Ottawa and Toronto.)\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Driftwood Provincial Park"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Foy Provincial Park"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lower Madawaska River Provincial Park"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Westmeath Provincial Park"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bonnechere River Provincial Park"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bonnechere Provincial Park"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThe region was first settled, as was most of North America, by First Nations people.  In this region very few Native Americans still reside, though there is a presence near Golden Lake, including a pow wow once a year.  As with many early attempts to penetrate the continents interior, the rivers served as the main route by which to do this and the Ottawa River was no exception.  Later the river served as the conduit for the lumber trade, which made millionaires out of men in the region.  The ties to the river are less strong these days, built still live on in some folklore, most notably Joseph Montferrand or Joe Muffaraw (depending on which side of the river you are on) a local strongman comparable to Paul Bunyan.  Renfrew is considered by some to be the birthplace of the NHL, though there is little in the town to show for it.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nThere is a discernible accent in the Ottawa Valley though those that understand English will have little trouble understanding or being understood.  There are some French speakers in the area as well, but even into the Quebec region on the other side of the Ottawa River, English will be easily understood.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nDespite the region's one time strong link to the railroad and the river, the only viable way to visit the region is by motor vehicle.  Highway 60 from the west and highway 17 (the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Trans-Canada Highway"]]},") from the northwest and southeast form the main routes in the region.  Bus service is possible to some areas, but there will often be only one bus per day.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nAccess to a motor vehicle is almost a necessity when travelling through the region, especially for areas off the beaten track.  Greyhound services the major towns but at infrequent times.  Some people take advantage of the relatively calm rivers to arrange multi day river journeys, but these also require some transport to the start and end points.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nThe urban areas serve primarily as local centres and have very few actual sites.  These towns usually have a local museum, and in Renfrew and Arnprior the river offers a pleasant locale for a walk or picnic.  \n\nFor a more authentic experience head for the rural areas.  Balaclava, not far from Renfrew, often makes the list for most picturesque villages in Ontario.  Eganville is another village on the Bonnechere River (as is Renfrew) and has a nice setting.  Nearby and also on the Bonnechere River are the Bonnechere Caves, a series of caves carved out of the limestone by the moving water.  These are privately owned and there is an entrance fee involved.  \n\nWilno has strong ties to Polish culture, and those interested can find numerous Polish sites nearby.      Foymount is the settlement in Ontario at the highest elevation.  On County Road #9 north of Kelly's Corner stands a small piece of virgin forest.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Itineraries"]},"\nThere are no set itineraries for the region, as points of note are often tied to scenery as opposed to \"must see\" sites.  One of the best ways to see the region is to explore the back roads.  If you are driving between two points, check your map or inquire locally if there is a back way to go.

Every town will have a greasy spoon, a Chinese restaurant, a fancier restaurant, a pizza place, and one or two fast food places.\n\nIf you ask around among locals you may be able to find some less common meats, which often come from hunting.  Be aware that it is also possible to buy illegal meat in this way, which is could result in some legal action.  In summertime, look for church picnics or BBQ's.  The town of Wilno is known for its Polish fare.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nLocal taverns abound throughout the region, many of which amount to little more than watering holes, although several of these are where you'll be able to see some of the local culture of the region.
