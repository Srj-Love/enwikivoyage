White taxis are rarer, more expensive, and exclusive. Green taxis are ubiquitous and of much lower quality, but are much cheaper to use. As there are no meters, all fees for all taxis are negotiated in advance, and you should not enter a taxi until you and the driver have agreed upon a price.\n\nThe small green taxi cabs should cost no more than XOF300 per person during the day for straight runs on main roads. Fees increase with distance or with departures from the main routes. Be prepared to share the cab with as many people as can be crammed in, or to pay a premium rate. Cabbies may attempt to charge foreigners far more.  If you have a lot of baggage, expect to pay more as well.  \n\nPrices go up at night especially to the city center (centreville). You should never pay more than XOF1,500 per person, and this is negotiable if you have a lot of people in your group to share the cab.  \n\nTravel to and from the airport is always expensive, even if you are only going a short distance. Expect a minimum of XOF1,500, and do not be surprised at asking prices in excess of XOF5,000. Be firm, and you can negotiate the price considerably downward.\n\nAlthough Ouagadougou is generally a very safe city, maintain the same caution that you would in any urban environment: only use green or white cabs, don't accept rides from drivers that appear to be drunk or who have cars that appear unsafe, and know that whites, obvious tourists, people with many bags, and people seeking rides at unusual hours are all at a higher risk of theft and other crimes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Ouagadougou place nations unies.JPG"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Place des Nations Unies (United Nations Square)"]]},"  \n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Grand Mosque of Ouagadougou"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat=12.366234"],["long=-1.521428"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Ouagadougou Cathedral"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat=12.361979"],["long=-1.526989"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Built by the French in teh 1930s, it is one of the largest in western Africa.
