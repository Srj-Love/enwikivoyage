Its location on the confluence of the Linschoten river and the Hollandse IJssel allowed Oudewater to develop as an important industrial center in the 16th and 17th century, with the production of rope being the main economic activity. \n\nInhabitants of Oudewater are nicknamed \"geelbuiken\", or \"yellow bellies\", after the dried, yellow hemp stems that the rope makers used to wrap around their waist as part of the production process.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Tourist Information Point"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.tip-oudewater.nl\/"],["email="],["address=Leeuweringerstraat 10"],["lat=52.02362"],["long=4.87185"],["directions="],["phone= +31 348 561628"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Apr 1 - Oct 31: Tu-Sa 10-16h, Su 11-15h, winter: W, F, Sa: 11-15h"],["price="],["content=The tourist information point is helpful if you have any questions, but also sells tickets for the boat trips, guided walks and single entry \"tourist cards\" that give access to both museums."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["N228"]}," passes right through Oudewater on its way from Utrecht to Gouda, and both cities are about a 20 minute drive away.
