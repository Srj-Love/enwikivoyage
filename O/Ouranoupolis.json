It was founded in 1922, when approximately 50 families, Greek refugees from Asia Minor arrived under the auspices of the League of Nations, looking for a new home. The land was provided by Mount Athos and each family was given an one bedroom house, an arid plot of land and ten sheep. Without a road to connect it to the rest of the world the village remained isolated and life was hard. In 1947 the locals took shovels and spades and cut a crude dirt-track road which ended the isolation and brought the very first adventurous tourists to the village.\n\nCurrently, Mount Athos-related trade and pilgrimage is the biggest source of income for the village.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nOuranoupolis can be reached by bus, car or taxi from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Thessaloniki"]]},".\n\nTo get by bus, you have to get to Chalkidiki Bus Station, located south of Thessaloniki.
