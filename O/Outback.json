Intensive agriculture on the coastal areas has animals per hectare (or acre),  in the outback, it is the animal per hectares (or acres).  The outback is often characterised as 'dry', but this is not always true: in the tropical north, the outback areas are wet as you can get anywhere on the planet.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe easiest way is to drive or join a tour. Most larger regional towns have airports, but lack car hire facilities, and the airports are often several kilometres out of town, so unless you intend to stay in one place the whole time, hiring a car in a major city and driving yourself out there is your best bet.\n\nAnother avenue to get to an outback destination is to fly in with an air charter company like ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.kirkhopeaviation.com.au\/ Kirkhope Aviation"]},"  There are many air charter companies that provide small group tours, usually 6 - 10 people. Small group air tours and charters flying to destinations throughout outback australia usually start from a major city Airport.  Flying into remote locations is possible when travelling in a small airplane. Air Charter services provide tour guides and most always include accomodation, tours, camping, food and entertainment.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nFor the average person, in more remote parts of the Outback, the only way to get around is by car (make sure you read up on staying safe. If you can afford bit more, consider chartering a helicopter. \n\nIf you want to try your luck hitch-hiking, depending on remoteness, make sure you ask around at the local pub rather than standing by the roadside. Some roads receive less than a car a week, or even longer, and given the semi-arid to desert climate, you could dehydrate and die in a matter of hours. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The beauty of the wilderness"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lake Eyre"]]}," "]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Itineraries"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Gibb River Road"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Gunbarrel Highway"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Oodnadatta Track"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Stuart Highway"]]},": crossing Australia north-south"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nMost towns have small grocery stores with basics essentials.

Even the Nullabor Plain is a drive that anyone can undertake once they are aware of the distances involved.\n\nHowever, it is always important to plan your trip carefully.

If you leave your vehicle you are likely to be the subject of a sad news story about the rescue services finding your car and not you. In any case, your vehicle is where you're storing your immense amounts of water.\n\nYou should also think about carrying a satellite phone or other means of contacting emergency services.\n\nYou should talk to the police in each town about your journey and the condition of the roads and your vehicle.  Be careful - even locals die out there.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["related"],["Driving in Australia]]"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["extraregion"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Australia"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Outback"]]}]
