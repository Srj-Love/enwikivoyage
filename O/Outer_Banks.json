State Highway 12 is known as Virginia Dare Trail, or more commonly \"the Beach Road\".  US 158 is known as Croatan Highway, but the locals refer to it as \"the Bypass\" or \"the Big Road\".  Most advertisements you find will refer to them that way.  \n\nThe Mileposts are similar to what you find on the interstates.  Green signs on the right hand side of the road, marked every half mile.  Milepost \"0\" is at the Wright Memorial Bridge on the north end in Kitty Hawk.  Head south on the Bypass or Beach Road and the Mileposts get higher with Milepost (MP) 16 at Whalebone Junction being the end of the 'main drag'.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Cape Hatteras"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/caha\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Is probably the most famous lighthouse in the Outer Banks; it presides over an area known as the \"Graveyard of the Atlantic.\" This is an area with a large number of wrecks."]]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":[" Four other lighthouses are located on the Outer Banks: Currituck, Bodie Island, Okracoke, and Cape Lookout."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[" Wright Brothers National Memorial"]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kitty Hawk"]]},", dedicated to the first successful flight."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Watch a Beach Apparatus Drill Reenactment at the Chicamacomico Lifesaving Station in Rodanthe"]},{"type":"*","value":[" The Lost Colony on Roanoke Island ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.thelostcolony.org\/"]}," Runs June-August; Wonderful entertainment for the whole family- from musical numbers to battle scenes.

If you want pirate kitsch or Rebel flag merchandise, this is the place to be.

In season, most restaurants are open and the choices are virtually unlimited.  Off season, many of the local eateries close down or limit their hours.  If you are traveling in the off\/shoulder season, expect the restaurant and shopping choices to be a bit more limited than during peak season.\n\nA few great places to try:\n\nFor breakfast, burgers and hometown lunch specials, try ",{"type":"'''","value":["Art's Place"]},", open 6AM to 6PM at MP (Mile Post) 2.5 on the Beach Road. Lunch specials daily, kids' menu and full ABC license.  Nice front porch and upper deck where you can enjoy a drink or chow down on their huge all-beef burgers.  Their ad says: \"Art's Place -- Food so good you'll think we stole your mom!\" They aren't kidding.\n\nFor dinner and a view, try ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Black Pelican"]}," at MP 4.5 on the Beach Road.  Stone oven pizzas, fresh seafood, steaks, nightly specials and drinks.  The building is an old lifesaving station said to be haunted.  Large dining room means you never have to wait hours for a seat.\n\nIf straight-out oysters and seafood is what you're after, ",{"type":"'''","value":["Awful Arthur's Raw Bar"]}," on the Beach Road at MP 6 is your best bet.  The only authentic raw bar on the beach, the food is great, the atmosphere is Outer Banks casual and when you're done stuffing your face full of oysters, you can skip right across the street to the Avalon Pier to see what they're catching.\n\nOf course, there are many nice restaurants to sit and have a great dinner.  Others to consider for their food, atmosphere, locations and overall popularity include: ",{"type":"'''","value":["Jolly Roger"]}," (MP 7 Beach Road), serving Outer Banks Italian; ",{"type":"'''","value":["JK's"]}," (MP 9 Bypass), serving seafood\/steaks and more; ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mako Mike's"]}," (MP 7 Bypass), serving steak\/seafood. Check out the live shark tank; kids love it!\n\nTake advantage of the local bars and restaurants on the island that not only offer good food but a great experience.

You will get your food in a hurry, but make sure your whole group arrives at the same time; otherwise the latecomers will be told to push through to join the earlier arrivals, which may not make the other guests entirely happy. You pay at the end of the queue, take your loaded tray to a table, eat, and exit through the back door, which expels you onto a narrow walkway beside the building's buried septic tanks. (Despite all this, the place has many regulars who claim to love it.) The servers are friendly and helpful, especially considering the cattle-herding ambience of the place; they refill your coffee and such, and tips are appreciated.
