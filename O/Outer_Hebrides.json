The scenery is beautiful. The landscape is rocky and mountainous, but also lush and verdant - due in no small part to the large amounts of rain which tend to fall. It is easy to find a quiet peaceful spot.\n\nThe Gaelic language and culture is appealing. At a practical level this means that place names on road signs are in Gaelic, but the bus timetables use the English names!\n\nReligion still plays an important part in many people’s lives. In Lewis and Harris this is often in the form of Protestant Churches. As a result the Sabbath (Sunday) is respected, so you are unlikely to find shops etc. open on a Sunday. Activities happening on a Sunday often are opposed locally. In contrast Barra and South Uist are mainly Catholic, and many businesses typically open after midday on a Sunday. Benbecula is half-Protestant and half-Catholic, and one can still find businesses open on a Sunday there.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Outer Hebrides UK relief location map.jpg"],["thumb"],["Outer Hebrides relief map and location"]]},"\nThe main languages are ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Scottish Gaelic phrasebook"],["Gaelic"]]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["Gàidhlig"]},") and English, with Gaelic (pronounced in English as 'gallick') being the dominant language in people's homes. However, outside their homes, Gaelic is mainly used as a social and cultural language. Virtually all Gaelic speakers over the age of 5 speak English to a near-native fluency.\n\nMost modern maps and road signs show the local place names in Gaelic with the English name shown below, usually in a smaller and often illegible font.
