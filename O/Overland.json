Today overlanding is a form of extended adventure holiday, often in a group. Overland tour companies provide a converted truck or bus and a tour leader, and the group travels together overland for a period of weeks or months.  Individual travelers may use public transport, personal motor vehicles, bicycles, or even travel on foot.\n\nSince the 1960s overlanding has been a popular means of travel between destinations across ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Africa"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Europe"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Asia"]]}," (particularly ",{"type":"[[","value":[["India"]]},"), the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["America"]]},"s and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Australia"]]},".

The railway has carried more than 4 billion passengers and its new N700 series trains are capable of 300km\/hr. France's TGV (",{"type":"''","value":["tres grand vittese"]}," or very high speed) attains similar speeds, making it faster than air travel for many journeys.

The Cairo to Cape Town and v.v. route covers more than 10,000km, usually following the Nile River through Egypt and Sudan, continuing to Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia along the way.  From the mid 1980s, the non-operation of the Aswan to Wadi Halfa ferry between Egypt and Sudan as well instability in Sudan, northern Uganda and Ethiopia, made the journey impossible. In recent years however, the Cape to Cairo and Cairo to Cape Town route has again become possible and increasingly popular both with commercial overland trucks carrying groups of 20 or so paying passengers as well as independent travellers on motorbikes or with 4WD vehicles. See ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alexandria to Cape Town by train and bus"]]},".\n\nThe traditional Trans Africa route is from London to Nairobi, Kenya and Cape Town, South Africa.  The route started in the 1970s and became very popular with small companies using old Bedford four wheel drive trucks carrying about 24 people each, plus lots of independents, normally run by groups of friends in 4x4 Land Rovers heading out of London from November to March every year. The usual route was from Morocco to Algeria with a Sahara desert crossing into Niger in West Africa, continuing to Nigeria. This was followed by a month long journey likened to Joseph Conrad’s “Heart of Darkness” through the forests of Zaire (now Democratic Republic of Congo), surfacing into the relatively modern world in Kenya via Uganda. From Kenya the last leg was south through Tanzania to either Zimbabwe or South Africa. \n\nThis route has changed dramatically due to border closures and political instability creating no-go zones.  The route has reversed itself somewhat over the last few years, with trucks now crossing from the north to the south of Africa, closely following the west coast all the way from Morocco to Cape Town with the biggest change in the route being made possible by the opening of Angola to tourism.  The journey then continues through Southern and East Africa from Cape Town to Nairobi and on to Cairo.\n\nIn South Africa the most popular route is Cape Town to Victoria falls. Companies have trucks leaving daily starting the route in Cape Town South Africa. The Cape to Vic route takes travellers through Namibia, Botswana and ending in either Zimbabwe or Zambia. \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Summary"]},"\n\nSince 2006 a few companies have offered overland expeditions from the UK to Australia.
