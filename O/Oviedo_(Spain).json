The cider you will find in Asturias is natural cider and has a reputation all over Spain. Drinking cider in Asturias is a ritual in itself: it is poured from on high in order to incorporate air into the cider as it falls from the bottle to the glass. When you get your glass of cider it will be naturally fizzy.  You are meant to drink in one gulp what the waiter offers you, leaving a little in the base of the glass. You then pour what's left out of the glass and hand the glass back to the waiter, who will  pour another glass for someone else.  Don't worry, though, he only ever pours about 2 mouthfuls at a time! Be aware that cider pouring is a messy business and the floor will get very, very wet and sticky (which is why the floors of sidrerías are covered in sawdust). \n\nIn many other bars and restaurants there is cider available. Look out for signs saying \"Sidrería\" or \"Chigre\". The best place to find a number of Sidrerías bz far is La Calle Gascona {100 mts from the Cathedral}.
