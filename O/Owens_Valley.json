However, due to a 1997 lawsuit, LA was required to restore the river in what was the largest river restoration ever undertaken in the US.  Starting in 2006, a sixty-two mile stretch of river is again flowing and the valley is beginning an impressive comeback.  LA retains rights to pump water from downstream, and thus this project has not significantly impacted the city's water supply."]]},"\n\nMuch of the recent history of the Owens Valley involves the \"theft\" of its water supply by Metropolitan Los Angeles.
