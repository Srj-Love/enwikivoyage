With its scenic town square, acclaimed restaurants, unique boutiques, oak-shaded neighborhoods, and friendly people, Oxford is the model Southern town.  Named after Oxford, England in hopes of attracting a university, the town was selected as the home of the University of Mississippi in 1848, which dominates life here today.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Oxford - Peabody Hall.jpg"],["thumb"],["350px"],["Peabody Hall"]]}," \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nOxford is the home of the University of Mississippi, affectionately known as \"",{"type":"'''","value":["Ole Miss"]},",\" and is in Lafayette County.  It also served as the inspiration for Nobel Prize winner ",{"type":"'''","value":["William Faulkner"]},"'s fictional Jefferson (Lafayette County being ",{"type":"''","value":["Yoknapatawpha"]},"), the locale of many of his novels.  Oxonians and University members like to describe the town with the motto ",{"type":"''","value":["\"We may not win every game, but we never lose a party.\""]},"  Locals also, \"partially\" jokingly, refer to the Square as the ",{"type":"''","value":["\"Center of the Universe.\""]},"  Many residents see Oxford as a small town ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Orleans"]]},", calling it the \"",{"type":"'''","value":["Little Easy"]},".\"  It is widely known throughout the South for its Southern charm, Old South feel, party atmosphere, and its ",{"type":"'''","value":["beautiful women"]},", whom even Hugh Hefner called the finest in the world.  Oxford is also considered a literary center with many writers calling it home.  Also being home to the Ole Miss School of Law and a federal courthouse, it is often said that everyone in Oxford is a ",{"type":"''","value":["\"lawyer, writer, or both.\""]},"  As if to prove this point, famous author ",{"type":"'''","value":["John Grisham"]}," still owns a house in Oxford and visits frequently.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["The Square"]}," is the center of downtown and is the main location for the town's best restaurants, shops, bars, and scenery (of the ",{"type":"''","value":["Old South architecture"]}," and gorgeous ",{"type":"''","value":["Southern belles"]},").  Chain restaurants, a Wal-Mart Supercenter, and other national retailers are located on the fringes of town.  However, most locals are staunchly anti-chain.  They actively protested the arrival of Applebee's and the Wal-Mart Supercenter, even voting out the old mayor because she did not do more to stop it.  Therefore, to truly enjoy Oxford, you must visit the Square and eat and shop at locally-owned establishments.  Otherwise, you are wasting your time visiting and are missing out if you only come for a football game.

Once you figure out how to navigate the square (it will take awhile) and the surrounding one-way streets, you can find a place to park by cruising the back alleys.  If you park illegally, you will get an expensive ticket.\n\nDo not drink and drive as the cops keep a watchful eye on the byways, not to mention you are risking your life and the lives of others.  You can avoid this by walking home, hitching a ride (it's easy to find a ride from a friendly stranger on the Square), or calling a cab.
