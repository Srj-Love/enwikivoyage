Oxford was first called Hood's Crossing, after the local Hood's Tavern. The borough was later called Oxford Crossing and Oxford Village.\n\nOxford was located near the half-way point on the main road from Philadelphia to Baltimore. The owner of the stage between the two cities purchased Hood's Tavern and re-named it Oxford Hotel. It became the stopping point on the two-day trip between the two cities.\n\nIn 1833, Oxford was officially incorporated as a borough. Its first burgess (currently called the mayor) was Thomas Alexander, who operated a general store in which the oldest public library in Pennsylvania was located. His store is thought to be the oldest building in Oxford.\n\nThe northern half of Oxford was owned by the Dickey family in the 19th century. The Dickeys included the local Presbyterian minister, the founder of the local bank, a state Representative, and local businessmen. Reverend John Miller Dickey and his wife Sarah Emlen Cresson founded Ashmun Institute in 1854 which later became Lincoln University, PA. The family played a major role in re-routing the planned railroad connecting Philadelphia and Baltimore. Track was laid in the 1850s, and by the time of the Civil War, Oxford was a bustling community. The business district on Third Street was entirely re-built at this time, including the Oxford Hotel (1858) and Oxford Hall (1862). Oxford became known for its confectionery and candy businesses and was the location of many manufacturing facilities.\n\nIn the late 20th century, transportation changes resulted in Oxford being located off the main roads. A bypass was constructed for U.S. Route 1, but the major change was the construction of Interstate 95 - which shifted the bulk of the Philadelphia-Baltimore traffic away from Oxford.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Geography"]},"\nOxford is located at 39°47′2″N 75°58′42″W﻿ \/ ﻿39.78389°N 75.97833°W﻿ \/ 39.78389; -75.97833 (39.783877, -75.978375).[1]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of 1.9 square miles (4.9 km²), all of it land.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Demographics"]},"\nAs of the census[2] of 2000, there were 4,315 people, 1,703 households, and 1,047 families residing in the borough.
