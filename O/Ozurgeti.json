Contrary to popular belief, you don't need to go via Kutaisi! Take any Batumi or Poti bound mashrutka, and get off at Kobuleti. From Kobuleti, you'll get a mashrutka to Zugdidi :)\nFailing that, head to Poti from Kobuleti and catch a Zugdidi bound mashrutka from there. The last mashrutka to Mestia leaves from Zugdidi between 1 and 3pm, so bear this in mind!\n\nSticking your head into one of the buses and saying 'Ukatsravad, \"place name\",' can help, especially if you can't read Georgian. \n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Southwestern Georgia"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Geo"],["41.933333"],["41.983333"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Ozurgeti"]]}]
