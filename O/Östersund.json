The city is famous for both its location to nearby nature aswell as winter activities. Östersund profiles itself as \"",{"type":"''","value":["vinterstaden"]},"\" (the winter city), and a lot of world cups in winter sports like biathlon and skiing are hosted in and around Östersund. As of 2014, Östersund is the home to roughly 60 000 inhabitants in the municipality.\n\nÖstersund (and Jämtland in general) have a long history with the Norwegian neighbours which is reflected in both tourism and trade. However most of the people living in Östersund are Swedish and of Jemtlandic descent. During both summer and wintertime there can be a lot of tourists in the city, especially during the annually \"",{"type":"''","value":["Storsjöcupen"]},"\" (a football cup for youths) and the music festival \"",{"type":"''","value":["Storsjöyran"]},"\". Östersund is residing next to Swedens 5th largest lake named \"",{"type":"''","value":["Storsjön"]},"\", and a lot of establishments and events are thereby influenced by that name. The lake itself is excellent for swimming and bathing in the summer and iceskating or dogsled in the winter - and of course fishing.\n\nThe city centre is filled with everything you would expect from a city, like bars and pubs, restaurants, shopping malls and stores. In the outskirts of the city you'll find the usual residential areas and industries. Östersund is also home to a lot of sights and museums, ranging from arts to cultural sites and activities. The weather in Östersund is very varying, from cold and dark winter nights with auroras and stars to sunny summer days where you'll spot most of the people bathing in the sun. However there are one more or less constant element which is the wind. Because of the location of the city (next to a big lake) it can be quite windy and the temperature feels a lot colder, especially during the winter months.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Åre östersund flygplats.jpg"],["thumbnail"],["Åre Östersund Airport"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Åre Östersund Airport"]}," is located on ",{"type":"'''","value":["Frösön"]},", 9 kilometres outside the city centre.
