The drive north from Copalis Beach on 109 is very beautiful with peaks of the ocean and the windswept forest all around you.  The quicker way to Pacific Beach is to head north out of Hoquiam on highway 101.  After four miles turn left onto Ocean Beach Road (well marked) and continue on this road for 20 miles, where it ends at Pacific Beach.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nPacific Beach is a small town.  You can walk end to end in about one mile.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThe attraction of Pacific Beach is the beach! The beach stretches for 50 miles from Ocean Shores in the south to Point Grenville on the Quinault Indian reservation to the north. Dogs, cars, fires, and fireworks are allowed on this beach - all of which are restricted further north on the beaches of the Olympic National Park. This area is the closest ocean beach accessible from Seattle (via Olympia\/Aberdeen).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nPacific Beach State Park - Campground and RV park directly on the ocean. The beach is wide and sandy. You will find seagulls, sandpiper birds, crabs, sand dollar and clam shells, seaweed, and driftwood. North and south of the campground a 100 foot high cliff rises up behind the beach.  Beyond the town the clifftop is forested, adding interest to the beach.  Waist-deep Joe Creek runs through the beach in this area.\n\nAnalyde Gap Road - Another route down to the beach, one mile north of the state park. Here you can drive your car right onto the beach. 100 years ago there were no roads in the area - the beach was the road.\n\nPacific Beach Resort - A motel, RV park, and vacation house rental resort for retired military personnel. The Windjammer restaurant, gift shop, and bowling alley are open to the public.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nBobsPacificBeachHouse.com - Great Ocean View, Short Walk to Beach, 3 King Beds\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=WA-109.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["directionl1=N"],["majorl1=END"],["minorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Taholah"]]}],["directionr1=S"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Aberdeen (Washington)"],["Aberdeen"]]}," via ",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:US 101.svg"],["18px"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ocean City (Washington)"],["Ocean City"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Olympic Peninsula"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Pacific Beach, Washington"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["47.208888888889"],["-124.20333333333"]]}]
