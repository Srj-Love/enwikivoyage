It is administered by the US Forest Service. The Forest Service partners with the Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, California State Parks, and the Pacific Crest Trail Association to provide effective management and protection of the trail.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Cascade pass.jpg"],["300px"],["thumbnail"],["North Cascade Pass, Washington State"]]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThe 2,663 mi (4,286 km) long Pacific Crest Trail ranges in elevation from just above sea level at the Oregon-Washington border to 13,153 feet (4,009 m) at Forester Pass in the Sierra Nevada. The route passes through 25 national forests and 7 national parks.  Its midpoint is in Chester, California (near Mt. Lassen), where the Sierra and Cascade mountain ranges meet.\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nThe Pacific Crest Trail was first proposed by Clinton C. Clarke as a trail running from Mexico to Canada along the crest of the mountains in California, Oregon, and Washington. The original proposal was to link the John Muir Trail, the Tahoe-Yosemite Trail (both in California), the Skyline Trail (in Oregon) and the Cascade Crest Trail (in Washington).\n\nThe Pacific Crest Trail System Conference was formed by Clarke to both plan the trail and to lobby the federal government to protect the trail. The conference was founded by Clarke, the Boy Scouts, the YMCA, and Ansel Adams (amongst others). From 1935 through 1938, YMCA groups explored the 2000 miles of potential trail and planned a route, which has been closely followed by the modern PCT route.\n\nIn 1968, President Lyndon Johnson defined the PCT and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Appalachian Trail"]]}," with the National Trails System Act. The PCT was then constructed through cooperation between the federal government and volunteers organized by the Pacific Crest Trail Association. In 1993, the PCT was officially declared finished.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Thru hiking"]},"\nThru hiking is a term used in referring to hikers who complete long distance trails from end-to-end in a single trip. The Pacific Crest Trail, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Appalachian Trail"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Continental Divide Trail"]]}," were the first three long-distance trails in the U.S. Successfully thru-hiking all of these three trails is known as ",{"type":"''","value":["the Triple Crown of Hiking"]},". Thru-hiking is a long commitment, usually taking between four and six months, that requires thorough preparation and dedication. Although the actual number is difficult to calculate, it is estimated that around 180 out of approximately 300 people who attempt a thru-hike complete the entire trail each year.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Prepare"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Deadman Canyon backpacker.jpg"],["250px"],["thumbnail"],["Hiker in Kings Canyon National Park, California"]]},"\nThe most common cause of failure to complete the PCT is lack of preparedness. It is important to begin regular walks in the months and weeks leading up to the thru-hike, beginning with low-impact day-hikes in easy terrain while carrying a minimum of weight. When these day-hikes become nearly effortless, increase the distance and include several multi-day hikes that require a full backpack with food, water and gear. In addition, hilly terrain should be incorporated as soon as possible in order to build up strength in the muscles required for climbs and descents. Performing regular hikes that continually push the body's current limits will not only toughen the body but will also go a long way toward mentally preparing oneself for the constant strain on body and mind.\n\nPreparing financially and logistically are also essential to a successful thru-hike. The cost of a hike will range from several hundred dollars a month on the low end to upwards of a thousand dollars a month for the high end. Each person has a different minimum level of comfort and nourishment; it is vital to discover what one's own level is as early as possible and to make supply arrangements accordingly. Study the route and identify towns that will serve as likely resupply centers and map out distances between post offices. An experienced thru-hiker resupplies his or her dry goods every 10-14 days, either through the post offices' general delivery drop-box system or through local purchases.  The average thru-hiker plans for six to eight months before the actual hike. In a few cases, the PCT passes through or near towns and resorts where supplies can be purchased. In other cases the trail users may need to get off the trail and travel to a town. Contact the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.pcta.org PCTA website"]}," for additional information on resupplying along the trail.\n\nMuch of this info is available in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wilderness backpacking"]]}," travel section, but generally equipment should be purchased well in advance of the PCT start date and should be used as many times as possible to both allow the hiker to become familiar with the gear (backpacks adjusted properly, boots broken in, etc.) and to identify any broken, impractical or unsatisfactory items. Prospective thru-hikers should get in contact with local hiking clubs and solicit advice on what pieces of equipment are completely unnecessary, which are luxury items and which are essential. Different hikers have different philosophies on how much gear should be taken, from those in the \"lean and fast\" school of thought which advocates a minimum of everything - no stove, no tent, hiking sandals instead of boots and little else - to the \"slow and comfortable\" school which sacrifices speed and low weight for comfort. One should get as many opinions as possible and attempt hikes with various levels of gear until an acceptable amount of weight and speed has been achieved.\n\nFire permits are needed in many areas, and fire closures may exist during extremely dry times of year. Above certain elevations or in some areas fires are not permitted. Please check ahead of your trip to determine if a fire permit is needed and where it can be obtained.\n\nMany of the wilderness areas, National Parks and other special management areas require an overnight use permit. Please check with the local area to determine if a permit is needed and where it can be obtained. Persons undertaking a trip of 500 miles or longer should contact the Pacific Crest Trail Association for a permit.\n\nWater is essential when traveling on the PCT. Depending on what location you are in, time of year and if there are water sources along your travel route will help determine how much water to carry. Filter and purify all water obtained from any natural source along the PCT.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nUseful information about the trail is provided by the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.pcta.org\/ Pacific Crest Trail Association"]}]},".

The first thing prospective thru hikers have to do before attempting a thru hike is to plan out and sketch out their trip. In general the decision of which route to take needs to be considered. While most hikers travel from the Southern Terminus at the Mexico Border northward to Manning Park, British Columbia, some hikers prefer a southbound route. In a normal weather year, northbound hikes are most practical due to snow and temperature considerations. If snowpack in the Sierra Nevada is high in early June and low in the Northern Cascades, some hikers may choose to 'flip-flop.' Flip-flopping can take many forms but often describes a process whereby a hiker begins at one end (on the PCT, usually the southern end) of the trail and then, at some point, like reaching the Sierra, 'flips' to the end of the trail (Manning Park in B.C.) and hikes southbound to complete the trail.
