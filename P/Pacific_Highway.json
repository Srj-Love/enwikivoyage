Additionally, it passes through a populous area of New South Wales, connecting you with many of the state's major cities and towns. The Pacific Highway is 800 km. long. It is possible to drive up the highway in a single day, but this is a six segment itinerary with several shorter drives and a number of stops in New South Wales cities.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Prepare"]},"\n\nWhen planning a trip up the Pacific Highway, the major consideration is ",{"type":"'''","value":["holidays"]},". The Pacific Highway links several large Australian cities and also passes through major beach holiday areas close to Sydney. Thus traffic is absolutely nightmarish at either end of a holiday period; it's not unheard of for trip times to be four times as long. The worst times to be traveling north are the afternoon and evening of Christmas Eve (or of the day before if Christmas Eve is a Sunday), the afternoon and evening of the day before the Good Friday holiday and the night before and morning of the first day of any long weekend. When traveling south, the end of holiday periods are the peak time. Since Australians take summer holidays in January, you will also want to avoid traveling north on the Friday or Saturday of any weekend in January, and likewise avoid traveling south on Sundays in January.\n\nAs the Pacific Highway is a major road passing through a populated area, there's no need to take special precautions as you might when driving through a remote area. It might be a good idea, as with all car trips, to make sure that you have food, water and warm enough clothing so that having to sleep in the car for a night wouldn't be a disaster. However, you wil have ample opportunity to purchase all food and drink along the way.\n\nSee also: ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tips for road trips"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Driving in Australia"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nYou can start from either end of the road, or from many points along its length.

There are freeway sections bypassing the parts from the Harbour Bridge to Chatswood and from Wahroonga to the Hawkesbury if speed is of the essence.  The section from Chatswood to Wahroonga cannot be readily bypassed.\n\nThe Pacific Highway starts directly on the northern side of the Sydney Harbour Bridge.  Stay left over the bridge and take the Pacific Highway exit (you can't access the highway from the tunnel).

Trees close to the sides of the roads are unforgiving of any mistakes made at speed.  This is especially true on the North Coast section of the road.
