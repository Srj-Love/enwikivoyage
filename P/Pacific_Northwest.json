Two thirds of the population lives west of the Cascades where progressive opinions such as environmentalism prevail, while in eastern sides political thought tends to be rather conservative.\n\nOregon was the first state to allow initiative and referendum, it was the first state to establish a beverage container deposit law (also known as a bottle bill), the first to legalize physician-assisted suicide, one of the first to legalize medical marijuana, and the first state to conduct all elections entirely by mail. Portland elected one of the first gay mayors for a city of its size. While Washington was the first state to actually legalize marijuana, Seattle was the first major U.S. city to have a female mayor and one of the first states to legalize gay marriage.\n\nThe Pacific Northwest has a reputation for innovation and is known for its airplane and computer product facilities.  Some of the largest and most well-known corporations call the Northwest home, these include: Costco, Eddie Bauer, Expedia, Amazon.com, Nordstrom, Starbucks, Tully's Coffee, Boeing, Microsoft, Intel and Nike just to name a few.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nMost people associate the Pacific Northwest with a lush region that receives large amounts of rain during the winter months, with wonderful summer days. However the Northwest's climate is largely defined by its impressive natural features; most importantly its mountain ranges which not only provide convenient dividing lines, but which also create distinct climates in each of the state's regions from the Pacific Coast to the valley and, once over the mountains, a desert region—all within a few hours drive of each other. Travelers who cover multiple regions during their stay will find the differences between regions stark and remarkable in that by traveling throughout the area a great variety of climates will be experienced.  Most of the glaciers in the lower 48 states are located within the Pacific Northwest as well as the largest rainforest and the Puget Sound which is the second largest estuary in the United States. There is more than enough to keep any outdoor enthusiast busy.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nThe Pacific Northwest accent is considered very similar to the General American standard accent (native to the Midwest), popularized in the 20th century by radio, TV and movies. People in the area generally have little to no problem understanding different accents of the English language. The Pacific Northwest attracts tourists from around the world, and it is common to hear many foreign languages being spoken in public in major tourist areas.\n\nThere are ethnically diverse neighborhoods in some of the larger cities where many languages are spoken, including large 'International Districts' in Portland and Seattle where many Asian languages are spoken.\nWashington is the thirteenth most populated state for example, but by comparison has the fourth highest Asian population.  Spanish is spoken by the majority in some smaller pockets in eastern Washington and Oregon.  Seattle's 98118 zip code centered around the Columbia City neighborhood in South Seattle is considered the most ethnically diverse zip code in the country by the US Census bureau with 59 different languages regularly being spoken.\n\nChinook Jargon was a pidgin or trade language established among indigenous inhabitants of the region. After contact with Europeans, French, English, and Cree words entered the language, and \"eventually Chinook became the lingua franca for as many as 250,000 people along the Pacific Slope from Alaska to Oregon.\" Chinook Jargon reached its height of usage in the 19th century though remained common in resource and wilderness areas, particularly but not exclusively by Native Americans and Canadian First Nations people, well into the 20th century.  Chinook Jargon was still in use in Seattle until roughly the eve of World War II, making Seattle the last city where the language was widely used. Today its influence is felt mostly in place names and a handful of localized slang terms.  Pronunciation of some of these terms is difficult and often separates the visitor from the local.\n\nSome examples of common Chinook terms\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Potlatch"]}," — in Chinook Jargon is a ceremony among certain tribes involving food and exchange of gifts, nowadays sometimes used to refer to a potluck dinner or sometimes the giving away of personal items to friends."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Tillicum"]}," — means \"people\/person\", \"family\", and \"people\"."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Tyee"]}," — leader, chief, boss.
