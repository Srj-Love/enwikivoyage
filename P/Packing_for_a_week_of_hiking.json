[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["TT Banner.jpg"]]},"\nThis is a sample list of things you might take on a week-long trip hiking in a wilderness area.  Even more than with other kinds of travel, packing for this kind of trip requires compromises between keeping weight down and making sure you bring everything you'll need, because you have to carry it all with you.  Depending on where you're going and the time of year, some of the items may not be useful to you, and there are inevitably additional items you'll want to bring along, but this should give you a general idea of what you'll want to pack.  (Please keep in mind that we want this list to be useful to people in general, so don't edit it for your own specific needs.)
