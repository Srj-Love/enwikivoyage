The place was still then named “TONGOTONG”, which was one of the barrios of the Municipality of Bangui, Ilocos Norte. He sold his wares from one house to another and he did not notice that it was already noon time. He was too tired and hungry, that he sought shelter in one of the houses nearby and probably to ask the hospitable owner of the house for a simple lunch. After the peddler had settled down, the owner of the house asked the peddler his purpose. The peddler did not at all understand the question, but just merely answered, “Ako’y pagud na pagod at ang sapatos ko’y pudpod,” in his usual Batangas accent. This reply became the byword of the residents of Barangay Tongotong even if they didn’t know the meaning of what the peddler had said.\n\nMonths later, a native of the Bicol Region came to seek employment in one of the logging companies which was operating in the locality. The place at that time had a lot of virgin forests and mountains, and logging business was still legal. The stranger did not know where the office of the company was located, so he just alighted in Tongotong even if it was not still the place where he was supposed to go. He asked one of the bystanders the name of the place and he immediately replied, “Ako’y pagud na pagod at ang sapatos ko’y pudpod,” because the bystander knew that he was Tagalog and that was the only Tagalog words that he knew. The amazed Bicolano just interpreted that the place might be Pagud-pudpod.\n\nThere and then Tongotong was changed to Pagud-pudpod and later shortened to Pagudpud.\n\nAccording to the elders Pagudpud is a deep Ilocano word which means soft sandy soil “kuppuoy” a kadaratan.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Mapframe"],["18.575"],["120.7979"],["zoom=14"],["height=470"],["width=470"],["layer=OP"]]},"\nYou can fly into Laoag City via Cebu Pacific or Philippine Airlines and then take a 90-minute bus or taxi ride into Pagudpud.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["GV Florida Transport"]}," - Offers sleeper buses with built-in toilet.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["RCJ Bus Lines"]},"\n\nEarnshaw cor Lacson St.\nManila\nTel. 63-2-7412994, 63-2-7819306\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Saud White Beach"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Saud white beach is very popular not only in the country but also to the other parts of the world.
