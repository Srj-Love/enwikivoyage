Photocopies of valid IDs are usually not considered valid. In-house security makes rounds of inspections to check compliance. If you are under age or without a valid ID to prove your age and found in the gambling premises, hotel staff will ask you to leave, and could ask the metro police to issue you a citation. Moreover, underage gamblers cannot collect any jackpot; such bets are void and the casino will at best return your wager before asking you to leave the premises. There is a curfew for anyone under the age of 18 and police are comfortable transporting violators to a juvenile center."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Front Sight"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.frontsight.com\/"],["email="],["address=1 Front Sight Road"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone =+1 702 897-9107"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Learn to handle any firearm like a professional."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Las Vegas"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Death Valley National Park"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=Nevada 160.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["directionl1=NW"],["majorl1=Ends at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beatty"],["N"]]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:US 95.svg"],["18px"]]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Las Vegas"],["S"]]}],["minorl1="],["directionr1=SE"],["majorr1=END"],["minorr1=",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Las Vegas"]]}]}],["image2=Nevada 372.svg"],["imagesize2=22"],["directionl2=W"],["majorl2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Death Valley National Park"],["Death Valley N.P."]]}],["minorl2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shoshone"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["lfarrow"]]}," Becomes ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:California 178.svg"],["18px"]]}],["directionr2=E"],["majorr2=END"],["minorr2="]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["36.208611"],["-116.011944"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Southern Nevada"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Pahrump, Nevada"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North_America\/United_States\/Nevada\/Localities\/P\/Pahrump\/"]]}]
