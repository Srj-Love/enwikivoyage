The town's permanent residents are a seemingly harmonious mix of common Thai folk, with an admixture of Western hippies and Thai rastas thrown in, which gives the place a unique vibe which may be appealing to some and off-putting to others.\n\nA sudden boom in guest house and bar construction from 2006 onwards has resulted in a great deal of spare capacity in the off-season. There has been a large increase in Thai people visiting after Pai was featured in a romantic Thai film, ",{"type":"''","value":["Pai in Love"]},". It can be hard to find a room during the busy season (Oct-Feb). There are now around 350 guesthouses and hotels in Pai, and the city centre has transformed into a tourist warren of Western-style restaurants, souvenir shops, live music venues, tattoo parlours, and bars that cater largely to the now significant influx of tourists and package tours.\n\nWhile the growth of Pai has been rapid and more or less every farm in the valley seems to rent bungalows, development so far has been largely tasteful and the town remains relatively serene during low season.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By road "]},"\nRte 1095 which connects Pai with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mae Hong Son"]]}," (50 km as the crow flies, but approximately 110 km by road) and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chiang Mai"]]}," (135 km) is a very scenic route through the mountains which takes several hours.

You can stop at the waterfalls and small towns along the way, and you'll really enjoy the trip, as opposed to being motion sick in a bus for hours, and being forced to stop at the driver's friends restaurants. Make sure to take some warmer clothing on your bike, as it tends to get a bit chilly in the higher portions of the ride.
