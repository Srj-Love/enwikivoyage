Its more recent history is particularly dark, with the successful invasion by the Khmer Rouge in the 1980s. For most of the 1990s the area was a Khmer Rouge stronghold, resulting in exploitation of gems and hard woods, with the profits funding their guerrilla campaign. The town and its surrounding area today, has been stripped of any natural resources, including those that made it famous. Mine fields are a common sight, and like the rest of Cambodia, locals live in abject poverty.\n\nIn 2009, a new strain of malaria was discovered in Pailin province, immune to easy treatment.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By land"]},"\nPailin is 80 km from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Battambang"]]}," on Hwy 57.
