You will likely be in Pakbeng because the two-day boat between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Huay Xai"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Luang Prabang"]]}," has to stop for the night, and a number of guesthouses have been set up to cater to passing tourists.

It`s also possible to arrive by speedboat en route to the north. Much more uncomfortable than the slow boat, however you will arrive before the slow boat so you have the option of choosing a guesthouse and showering with no lines\/queues. You also get to see the town as the only Westerner. Another possibility is to reach the place by bus. This is a rough and long option.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\nThe boat landing is at the end of Rte 2 on the Mekong. Slow boats leave in the morning in both directions. They depart when full but expect to start at around 09:00. Arrive early to get one of the better seats (as far away from the loud engine as possible). The in-bound  boat normally arrives at about 17:00, but this is Laos, so bear in mind that this is a guideline.  Laos transportation goes when the driver can be bothered. It's best just to relax and enjoy the peace and quiet.

Most of the guesthouses are along the first 50 m of the main street as you head up the riverbank.\n\nWith the roads and particularly the rocky riverbank just above the boat landing being very steep, it might seem tempting to accept an offer for someone to carry your bag for you.

Be careful while paying though, he might tend to give you back too little or hand you unusable (too old, broken) dollar notes. (NEVER accept a banknote that's torn. It's unusable!)\n\nLocals set up small sandwich stands along the road to the waterfront each morning. You can buy basic sandwiches of bread and Laughing Cow cheese.

There might be places where you can get a room for USD2, but you'll have to search long and bargain hard. Considering hot water: make sure that your bathroom has an individual electric boiler, as there are guesthouses with central boilers that only provide a certain amount of hot water for the whole guesthouse on a first-come first-served basis. \n\nTouts are prevalent in Pakbeng, and you will be bothered. However, these touts are very laid back, especially compared to Thailand. If you are after a really cheap option, it is possible to get a mattress and a mosquito net under a veranda for about USD0.50. Just watch out for monkeys. \n\nIt is possible, but not necessary to book accommodation in Pakbeng in advance, as there are plenty of guesthouses and almost all visitors stay only one night.\n\nThe exception to this rule is if you're looking for something a little more upmarket, in which case you have only two choices.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Mid-range"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Luang Say Lodge"],["url=http:\/\/www.luangsay.com\/Luang-Say-Lodge.Laos-mekong-river.html"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=Up-market option, offering luxury bungalows mostly for passengers on the Luang Say cruise boat."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Pak Beng Lodge"],["url=http:\/\/www.pakbenglodge.com"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=USD62-135"],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=French-run hotel offering smart rooms, river views from the balcony and French wine in their restaurant."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Pheksokxai Lodge"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=If you have entered Pakbeng by slow boat from Huay Xai, when you get out of the boat and walk up the road leading down to the port, then turn left almost following the road out of the town.
