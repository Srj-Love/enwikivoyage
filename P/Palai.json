It also has trade in spices such as pepper, ginger etc. Indeed, before rubber became common around the middle of 20th century, Palai was noted for its spices. A particular brand of pepper called ",{"type":"''","value":["Palai Pepper"]}," was then quoted in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]}," market.\n\nPeople of Palai are largely dependent on agriculture, particularly rubber. The good price of natural rubber for nearly half a century has made the people here prosperous. Historically the people are hard-working and attached to land. \n\nPalai can be visited throughout the year but the heavy monsoon months of June and July may be avoided, as roads are likely to be flooded. Also, the extreme summer months of March-May are quite warm and sultry. But like the rest of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kerala"]]}," temperature rarely goes above 35C or below 22C at any time during the year.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe nearest airport is about 80 kilometres away at Kochi (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cochin"]]},") from where one can travel by road (a 2 hour drive).

But an autorikshaw will save you from the heat and the humid weather. Due to the presence of thick vegetation the atmosphere is quite sultry.
