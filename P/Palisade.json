Named for the austere and dramatic stone palisades of Mesa Verde Sandstone and Mancos Shale north of town, this sleepy farming community is surrounded by mesas of all shapes and sizes. Looming in front of the town are the dun-colored bluffs of the Bookcliffs, also known as the Palisades. The Bookcliffs form many different pillars, boulders and hoodoos that balance in seemingly impossible positions along Interstate 70. \n\nPalisade is peach country, home to the eponymous Palisade Peach. Over 75 percent of Colorado's wine grapes come from Palisade, and the town is home to over a dozen wineries. Most visitors come in the summer months, or early fall when the grapes are being harvested.\n\nThe best times to visit Palisade are May, June or September. The weather is mild and there are an abundance of outdoor activities to enjoy. The town is probably best known for its three  big festivals, Palisade Bluegrass and Roots Festival ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.palisademusic.com"]},", Palisade Peach Fest ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.palisadepeachfest.com"]},", and Colorado Mountain Wine Fest ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.coloradowinefest.com"]},".\n\nThere is an informal, rustic charm to this small town. Historic Victorian gingerbread houses line the road into town, while Main Street offers a \"Norman Rockwell\" setting. Most of the inhabitants know each other by first name. Travelers can experience this camaraderie first hand at the summer farmer's market, held downtown on the weekends. The market features local musicians, artists and fresh produce. \n\nThe changing seasons bring something different for visitors to enjoy. The fruit trees blossom in the early spring, the grapes hang heavy on the vines at harvest time, while the grape leaves turn red and orange in late fall. \n\nPalisade is the perfect coda to the more frenetic and higher-priced ski resorts of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Aspen"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vail"]]},". Visitors can relax on the front porch of a local inn or bed and breakfast, sip fine wine and enjoy the scenery, all without breaking their budgets.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nYou're going to have to rely on neighboring Grand Junction, just 10 minutes away by car or taxi, to fly into Palisade.\n \n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.walkerfield.com\/index.asp Grand Junction Regional Airport"]}]},", (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["GJT"]]},"), otherwise known as Walker Field, is served by six airlines with nonstop service to Dallas\/Fort Worth, Denver, Salt Lake City, Phoenix, and Las Vegas.
