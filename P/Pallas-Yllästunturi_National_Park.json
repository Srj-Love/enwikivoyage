The park with an area of 1020 sq.km (third in size in Finland) was established in 2005, by extending one of the oldest national parks of the country, established 1938, and is visited by around 400,000 people per year. It has around 350 kilometres (220 miles) of marked hiking trails and 500 km of cross-country skiing trails.

Height differences are more than 500 metres, which is unusual for Finland. The location gives an interesting mixture of fells, forests and mires, associated species and local livelihood (where farming ends and reindeer husbandry becomes important). Enontekiö, with its centre ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hetta"]]}," at the northern end of the park, is part of the ",{"type":"''","value":["Sami native region"]}," (where Sami have special rights, such as Sami being an official language).\n\nDue to the nearby ski resorts (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ylläs"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Levi"]]},") and the comparably southern location, connections to the park are good (especially in season), with night trains, planes and coaches (combining with regional bus or shuttle taxi transport).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Wilderness Hut Finland.jpg"],["thumb"],["Wilderness hut near the treeline."]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nThe peak season is in February–April (especially the winter vacations of schools and Easter).

Daylight is scarce. Temperatures below -20° are normal and -40°C possible. Before New Year there is often only little snow.\n\nMay to middle June is spring, with lots of water because of melting snow. Trails are very susceptible to wear.\n\nSummer and early autumn, from mid June onwards, are also popular seasons.  With the summer come the mosquitoes and their friends.

Some of the most remote routes (\"wilderness skiing trails\") have poorer quality tracks.\n\nOrdinary modern cross-country skis are for skiing in prepared tracks. If you deviate from these you may not be able to cope with changing snow conditions.
