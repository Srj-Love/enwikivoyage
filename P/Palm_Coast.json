This is an excellent city for outdoor recreation, with an expansive Intracoastal Waterway system that attracts boaters, to a number of parks and winding ocean front jogging trails where outdoor lovers can start their day off right with a walk or jog.\n\nThe city is home to approximately 60,000 residents, and lies on the Northeastern coast of Florida in between Jacksonville and Orlando. Palm Coast is close enough to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["St. Augustine"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Daytona Beach"]]},", and Mt. Dora for a few afternoon trips but far enough away from any major tourist developments. The beauty of Palm Coast lies in the ability to sustain a downtown lifestyle with charming shops scattered throughout the downtown streets. As well, Palm Coast manages to maintain an essence of peace and tranquility while still inviting tourists to enjoy the laid back lifestyle. There are an abundance of golf courses, marinas, and tennis courts to keep visitors busy for an entire summer.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nWith the peaceful, laid back lifestyle of Palm Coast, this is a perfect location to bring along a pet during your vacation.

Part of the pathway and bike trail is already open, currently known as the St. Joe Walkway, which starts at the Palm Coast Community Center on Clubhouse Drive. The remainder of trails and waterway paths are opening as they are renovated and will be an excellent place for visitors to take dogs on a leisurely walk while enjoying the beauty of Palm Coast. \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["James F.

As of 2004, the city began adding on a dog park at the edge of the park, close to the Florida Park Drive entrance, near pavilion 3. While there are many amenities dedicated to families at the park, this portion will be dedicated to allowing the family pets room to run around and play. The park should be finished as of 2006 and will be a fenced area where pets can even get off their leashes for a while to enjoy a little fresh air and freedom.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Princess Place Preserve"]}," This beautiful 1500-acre park offers abundant opportunities for dogs and humans alike to get out and stretch their legs after a long ride in the car traveling to Palm Coast. The preserve is in Palm Coast at 2500 Princess Place Road, off of Old Kings Road. There are facilities for canoeing, kayaking, and boating, as well as primitive camping and walking trails. For dog owners, the walking trails are an excellent place to let dogs have a little freedom. With the many different, winding trails it is likely you could walk for a few miles without running in to another hiker or dog walker. While the park is open to campers overnight, the main gates open at 7AM and stay open until 6PM.
