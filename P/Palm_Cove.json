It could almost be seen as the northern limit of suburban Cairns.  It avoids the crowds and some of the over development that is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Port Douglas"]]},", its northern neighbour.\n\nIt is immediately adjacent to the residential suburb of Clifton Beach, but you could easily stay there for a month and never be aware of this.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nFrom Cairns it is a half hour taxi ride to Palm Cove.  The Cairns local bus service runs to the town surprisingly frequently, every half an hour or so.

There is a walking\/cycle track to Clifton Beach will will take around half an hour.  Ignore the nice \"rainforest walk\" map distributed around town, which is a 20 metre walk designed to take you to the newer apartment developments, head the opposite direction, south, along the beach for much better bush, beach, and walking opportunities.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Jet Ski Hire"]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Swim"]}," - there are stinger nets in season.
