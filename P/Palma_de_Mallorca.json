Half the population of Mallorca lives in the city of Palma.\n\nThe city occupies the north western end of a bay in the south west of the island of Mallorca. The city council also has jurisdiction over the sub-archipelago of Cabrera including the islands of Cabrera, Conejera, Estells, Imperial, Rodon, Foradada, Plana, and Pobra.\n\nThe name ",{"type":"''","value":["Palma"]}," dates back to the Roman settlement on the site of the present city, although the area was originally settled during the Bronze Age. In the early middle ages it was conquered by Arabs, who named it ",{"type":"''","value":["Madina Mayurqa"]},". In 1229 it was conquered by King Jaime I, ruler of Valencia and Aragon, and became an important trade city.  Palma saw its dark ages in the 16th century, when a significant decline was caused by attacks from Turkish and Berber Pirates and through plague.  Lasting until the 18th century, Felipe V changed the government which made Palma the capital of the Balearic Islands.  Later, Carlos III established a free trade pact with the Indies, which had a huge impact turning financials around in Palma.\n\nThe city became a tourist destination in the 1950s, and tourist numbers have continually increased in the subsequent half century.  Palma is a busy commercial and cultural center of Mallorca.  This independent region of the Balearic Islands of Spain have over half of the island’s population living there. The holiday season lasts from the end of April until October, and from November to April, temperatures range from 20-28 degrees Celsius (60-70 degrees Fahrenheit) and may require a jacket in the evenings.\n\nPalma de Mallorca, during the 19th century, more sea traffic would come in bringing in much economic growth for the island.  Today, Mallorca is one of Europe’s major holiday destinations, with many tourists coming from everywhere, every year.  Palma is a city of modern, hotel chains, and flashy shops, yet, is dated and still retains much of the old architecture, with the Old Town having narrow streets, and showing the restored cathedral standing proud in the center of town.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Plane"]},"\nPalma's city airport (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["PMI"]]},") is the major airport in Mallorca, and has daily flights from many European cities on national and budget carriers.

All EMT buses are equipped with onboard screens and loudspeakers that state the current and next stop, in both Spanish and Catalán.\nEMT's line number 1 will take you from the airport through Palma downtown and to the outer dock of the main harbor (where most large cruise ships dock). Arrivals\/departures every 15 minutes from 7:00am until 8:00pm. They operate once every 30 minutes from 6AM to 10PM. The fare is €3.00.  There is only one fare, so you don't need to specify your destination to the driver\/conductor! All other local EMT destinations within Palma cost €1.50, so you need to tell the driver \"no aeroporto, por favor!\".\n\nIn an effort to reduce drunk driving and get less people driving on the weekends, Palma offers a ´bus de nit´ bus service.  In Catalán, it obviously means ´night bus´.  It is full of locals, and Spaniards from the peninsula and runs from 10PM to 6AM every 20 to 30 minutes all night long.  The bus costs 1€ and goes all the way down the infamous ´paseo maritimo´, which is where all the best clubs are in Palma.\n\nTip; if you really enjoy clubbing, do not be afraid to go a few miles along the Paseo Maritimo. The numbers start at 1 and go up to about 80.  The biggest clubs (i.e. Tito´s and Level) are located in the 20´s.

The first bus in the winter season starts from Cathedral at 10:00AM and the last bus in winter starts from the same place at 06:00PM.\n\nLike much of the Balearic Islands and the Catalonia region of Spain, the locals speak Catalan as well as Spanish. In addition, the island of Mallorca has it's own version of Catalan called Mallorcan. For this reason, fewer locals learn to speak English.
