It is a natural bay surrounded by lofty headlands on either sides, resulting in a calm, idyllic sea with a gently sloping bed which allows you to walk up to 100 m out from the beach.\n\nPalolem is located at almost the southern end of Goa and is thus far from the more crowded places. This is in a way both an advantage and a disadvantage. For those seeking quiet and solitude, Palolem and the other beaches around it fulfill that need very well. But for those who need a noisy, vibrant place, it can be quite disconcerting.\n\nOver the last few years, though, there has been a fair increase in tourists. One reason for this could be the film The Bourne Supremacy which had a scene filmed here. During the peak season, the place can become quite crowded with backpackers, traveling groups and the attendant businesses.\n\nUnfortunately Palolem has been saturated by travellers, hawkers and over priced sellers: it is sometimes difficult to walk up the beach at high tide due to the restaurants jutting into the cresting waves and you will certainly be asked about your plans for dinner a few times.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nThe easiest way to get to Palolem is to take the train or fly to Margao (locally known as Madgaon) and pay for a Government approved fixed-price taxi to Palolem.  Fixed-price taxis are available from the train station and from Goa Dabolim Airport(GOI) at Vasco da Gama.\n\nAlternatively, Canacona is Palolem's nearest train station, approximately 5 minutes drive away, but for shorter journeys from other parts of India it is almost always better to arrive by bus due to the remoteness of the train station from Palolem beach.\n\nBackpackers may also take a State Transport bus from Margao Bus Stand to Canacona or Palolem. It takes around 90 minutes. If you alight at Canacona bus station, you can take an autorickshaw or taxi to Palolem Beach which is only about 3 km. The journey by bus is comfortable and the route is a scenic one too. However do keep in mind that local buses in Goa are not air-conditioned and at times quite dusty. It is possible to walk from the bus station to Palolem, but might not be the ideal option on a hot sunny day.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nPalolem is quite small, so easy to explore on foot.  Mopeds and bicycles are available for hire on the main street.\n\nTaxis and rickshaws are also readily available on the main street or though a travel agency.  Day trips can be booked through agencies.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nCotigao wildlife sanctuary is a good day trip from Palolem. You can also ride along the narrow but beautiful coastal road northwards to visit Agonda beach and still further north Cabo da Rama(a ruined fort on a cliff)\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Palolem green island sunset.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["Sunset over Green Island from Palolem Beach"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Beach"]},"\n\nTake a walk to Butterfly Island... You will spot this island to your right on entering the beach... you can walk along the beach and across some rocks during low tide and reach the island, during high tide water covers and makes it impossible to walk across. The island has a network of trails to explore and the more adventurous can traverse the rocks on the periphery of the island. Make sure you carry your water bottle and be careful, people have injured themselves walking over these rocks.\n\nFurther on to the right is Butterfly Beach. You'll need a boat to get there but worth a trip for a change of scenery. It has a very steep beach, so deep that you can dive in from the waters edge if you time your dive correctly.\n\nFurther on still is Honeymoon Beach, a small strip of beach which generally brings you total seclusion. These islands are usually visited by couples who want get away from the prying eyes of tourists.\n\nThe best time for a boat ride to these islands is either in the morning at 07:00 or in the evening around 17:00 when you can see the setting sun from the boat. You need to bargain really hard with the boatsman to strike a good deal, there are quite a few guys running these boats and it would be best to talk to 3-4 guys before you strike a deal, a good rate would be Rs 700-800 for an hour long ride.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Activities"]},"\n\nPalolem is a small beach town but do take long walks (carry a torch\/flashlight if walking along the beach at night!). If you happen to be there on a full moon night, its quite an experience stolling on the beach on a full moon night with the islands clearly visible in the moon light,you will find people partying late into the night up to 2 - 03:00 in the morning .Immediately to the south of Palolem, which gets busier every season, is the beautiful Columb Bay where you can stay in a comfortable yet eco friendly complex. Just beyond is Patnem beach which used to be much quieter than Palolem but has a few guest houses and beach shacks.\n\nYou can take a boat ride in the river joining the sea on northern side of the Palolem beach.\n\nVery quiet and more in the 1960s than in the 21st c (thank goodness). No Jet Skis - no rip-offs or touts - very good locals who make this a unique place in India - one that the authorities could learn a lot from - more the sort of place you come to compose music on the beach.\n\nFrom Palolem you can find some outdoor sport as :\n",{"type":"*","value":["Scuba diving ( near Palolem Guest house )"]},{"type":"*","value":["Canyoning and trekking tour ( book at Casa Fiesta restaurant )"]},{"type":"*","value":["Rent self-paddle sea kayak boat(in samson`s kiosk)"]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["Other activities"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Palolem.JPG"],["thumb"],["right"],["Palolem Beach"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["Take a boat trip to see Dolphins, best time is sunset and sunrise, great boat crew near the Church on the right hand side."]},{"type":"*","value":["Day trip to Dudhsagar Falls (Sea of Milk) which are in the top 100 highest falls in the world."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":["A visit to the spice farms."]},{"type":"*","value":["A day trip to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Karwar"]]},".

Palolem Beach is long beach now entirely filled with rooms and huts (150-400 Rs.) and restaurants, sometimes with live music. There's also a market for tourists. Walk the beach at night with a flashlight and you'll be amazed by crabs running away from you.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nIf you are part of the consumer rat race - a shoppaholic - this is not a great place for you - but there are great crafts people on the beaches (stone carvers, instrument makers etc.). Be very firm but polite if you don't want their wares - they are much more polite and civilised than sellers on other Indian beaches - let's keep it that way! The situation has got worse in recent years though with the result that there are now far too many beach sellers. Your best bet is to compare their prices with what the shops are charging....generally the shops are cheaper. There are also many beggars, some are regulars who follow the tourist season and the tourists around, but giving 10 or 20 rupees to an old woman will not kill you.\n\nOn the beach front and inland there are many wonderful little music shops, spice shops and garment shops - some of which are mini bazaars. The hippy influence over the years means that they can let you chill out and choose rather than trying to hard sell you from the second you enter the store. Some of the stores are now onwed by westerners offering western labels at cheap but fixed prices.\n\nThere are no ATM's near the beach in Palolem. There is one that is 2 km away from the main stretch of restaurants and shops that the rickshaw drivers will take you to at a heightened charge (try to get 40 rupees there and back, but you may need to pay 60 or 70). This one has a surcharge of $4 though. The easiest thing to do is bring enough money with you. More shops, a Saturday market and several ATM's are a 10-minute drive away in the local town, Chaudi.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nSome people are under the mis-apprehension that most of the food in Palolem is quite westernised.  Actually most places serve both \"international\" food and Indian - so you have the choice. There are great curries and rotis\/nan\/chippati\/rice almost everywhere and these are great and very cheap to live on. Being more sensitive to local needs and choosing local brands is more environmentally sound, means that you help the local economy more - your money doesn't just go on exports, halves the cost of your stay and give you a more Indian experience - so call for a King's, not a Fosters as so many embarrassing \"westerners\" do! Also remember that the chefs idea of an western dish may be slightly different than yours in some of the restaurants.\n\nLocal trade is mainly tourism and fishing - so it can be guaranteed that your fish dinner is straight from the sea.  A good fish main course usually starts from 300Rs upwards.\n\nFernandes - just past the church on the right hand side of the beach, great Indian food and tandori plus fairly cheap and fresh fish, a favourite for old regulars.\n\nPalolem Beach Resort - Curries in Palolem tend to be quite lacklustre - but the Palolem Beach Resort does a great paneer butter masala and chana masala with garlic naan and rice.  Chicken is great here too. The service is really poor and most of the focus is on foreign tourists, best avoided. The food quality is ok and serving size is quite genorous. One of the few places on the beach where there is a proper restaurant and clean washrooms and a proper kitchen. They also have a large wall mounted TV, which mostly plays football to cater to western tastes.\n\nCool Breeze - a jazz café that is quite popular with the locals, great food.\n\nSameer Restaurant - good breakfasts and their fish sizzlers are to die for.

Bear in mind that a local law prohibits permanent structures on the beach, so from May to October the shacks are supposed to come down (although this does not always happen!). Shacks should be 100% free of crawling insects. At Xmas and New Year it can get very busy and room rates are high, expect to pay a minimum of R500 \/ 700. The left hand side of the beach tends to be quieter with the right hand side where the bars \/ nightlife are. Cressida does good live music on Wednesdays. Local touts would gherao you once you hit the parking area, you can take there services, they would show you the shacks, bargain hard with them. Most of the average cost shacks would cost about 500 -700 Rupees ( Nov 2011 prices) and are very basic, do check before you pay that it has clean bed sheets, and running water and the room has been cleaned up. Most of the shacks would have a mosquito net, however no a\/c or hot water would be availabe in the room.\n\nDon't forget to bargain for the prices of the beach huts - the more temporary it looks, the cheaper it's supposed to be.

The beach dogs are not generally aggressive and the main problems they present are fleas and mange, but the dogs on the back roads away from the beach can be noisy and peevish. Many dogs in Goa are badly treated by their owners, and some have no owners at all. Please do not harm the dogs of Goa, but be aware that they can be a nuisance.\n\nThere were also people selling mehndi (similar to henna) carelessly mixed with cheaper chemicals.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\nThe local train station is Canacona - less than 5 minutes drive from Palolem.  It's very quiet with not many trains.\n\nIf you want more choice, get a taxi to Margao where you can link up with all the main lines. If you have a little extra time and you want to save money, take the local buses. Dirt cheap, respectful locals and careful drivers. For a taxi ride that would cost you 1000 Rs. upwards (depending on what the cabbie thinks he can make off of you), you could get there for 17 Rs.!!\n\nDon't miss the chance to haggle with flashy yellow plate cars. These are taxis heading to the Airport. (Though all yellow plate cars are taxis, the flashy ones usually head to the airport. These are either returning or heading to pick a prebooking. Haggle hard and you may settle for under Rs. 500, though only during the day. As the sun goes down, the price goes up, which is normal for all facilities.\n\nIf you are interested in exploring nearby places, like the Patnem beach about 2-3 kilometres away, rent a bicycle. Better yet, rent a scooter\/motorcycle for about Rs.300-500 per day and explore the area even more conveniently.\n\nA little quieter (and more expensive) than Palolem is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Agonda"]]},", a 15-minute autorickshaw trip north.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usablecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["15.008889"],["74.022778"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Canacona"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Palolem Beach"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Palolem Beach"]]}]
