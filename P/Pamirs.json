The violence occurred after a top military official was stabbed to death, which resulted in the military going after a local opposition strongman. Official reports indicated 42 dead, but there are unofficial reports of 200 or more dead, including Tajik troops, opposition, and possibly civilians. The region's largest city, Khorog, is said to resemble a warzone. The government has blamed \"citizens of Afghanistan\" for the violence and is investigating whether members of the Taliban or al Qaeda are involved, but this is most likely hot air. This is likely the worst outbreak of violence the region has seen since the end of a civil war which kept it within Tajikistan. Travelers planning to visit the region in the coming months (after July 2012) should follow news of the security situation in the region closely and seek the advice of your embassy.
