It has its own charm, a river flowing along one side of the city, some areas which are low-rise and red-roofed, and even a Latin Quarter at the eastern end of town. Increasingly, it is shaping itself as a centre where cultures (many from across the globe, and from diverse areas of India too) meet and creativity flourishes.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Panaji Church (3044129555).jpg"],["thumb"],["Church of Our Lady of Immaculate Conception"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nThe nearest airport is at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vasco da Gama"],["Dabolim"]]},", 35 km away.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\nThe nearest railway station is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Karmali (IR station code : KRMI)"]},", about 10 km to the east, but many express trains do not halt there.

Be sure to fix fares before the ride.\n\nIf you are on a tight budget, and carrying little baggage, you could take the local bus. To get to the bus stop, get out of the Karmali station, a short climb and across the road is the bus stop. Wait across the road for busses going towards Panaji. There is no sign board marking the Bus stop.\n\nOn the first floor of the KTC Bus stand at Panaji is the Konkan Railway ticketing office, you can make or cancel all Indian Railway tickets here. A Rs. 10 service fee is levied on each transaction, which is well worth it, as it saves you making a trip to Karmali, Thivim or Madgaon station to do ticketing work. The ticketing office is air conditioned, has seats, and issues tokens, so you don't have to stand in a queue awaiting your turn.

The non air-conditioned, state transport bus, that though cheap is an interesting way to travel, if you don't mind the discomfort of a rattling bus body, ridgid seats, over crowding and stopping at umpteen villages and bus depots along the route. You could also take a reserved ticket, which assures you of a seat, though is no protection against over crowding. Locals usually share seats. The state transport corporations, also have semi luxury and luxury busses. Luxury meaning the seats are padded and recline.\n\nThe major state transport corporations operating in Goa are the Kadamba Transport Corporation (KTC), from Goa, Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC), from Maharashtra, and the Karnataka State Road Transport from Karnataka. All the state transport busses, usually begin and terminate at the Kadamba bus stand at Panaji. Bookings, time tables etc. can be had here.\n\nDozens of semi luxury and luxury busses also connect Panaji with Mumbai, Pune, Mangalore, Bangalore, and Hyderabad. A relatively comfortable option is the Air conditioned Volvo coaches that operate towards the later hours. Find out prices before you purchase a ticket, as it is not uncommon to find that your neighbour on the bus has paid a much higher or lower price for the ticket. Many travel agents have their offices in the building adjacent to the Kadamba bus stand.\n\nA famous romantic Bollywood film \"Bombay to Goa\" starring the Indian super star Amitabh Bachchan, was based on this bus journey.\n\nAll private busses leave from the bus stand at the beginning of the Mandovi bridge.
