In just one week, visitors can enjoy two different oceans, experience the mountains and rainforest, learn about native cultures and take advantage of vibrant urban life. The capital, Panama City, is a modern, sophisticated metropolis that resembles Miami and has established commerce, arts, fashion and dining. Fodors, Frommers and National Geographic have all recently began publishing guides for Panama, only the second country in Central America, behind Costa Rica, to have such extensive travel coverage.\n\nPanama is known as the \"Crossroads of the Americas\" due to its privileged position between North and South America. The indigenous meaning of the country's name, \"abundance of fish\", reflects Panama's reputation as a paradise for water sports enthusiasts and eco-tourists alike. As the isthmus connecting two massive continents, Panama's flora and fauna is incredibly diverse. For example, Panama was recently named the country with the most bird species in the world; over 900. Panama's many indigenous tribes are still thriving, living in the same ancient manner as their ancestors, making its cultural fabric exceptionally rich.\n\nPanama's government has strong ties to the United States and strongly supports business, development and tourism. The International Monetary Fund applauds the country's diversified economy and predicts it to have one of the strongest GDP growth rates in the world for the next several years. Panama is known for its highly developed international banking sector, with about 80 banks from several countries establishing local branches, including HSBC, BBVA and Citi Bank. Currently undergoing expansion, the Canal continues to drive Panama's service-based economy and remains one of the most important transportation links in the world. In addition to the country's strong economic base, Panama's physical infrastructure, including modern hospitals, airports and roads, is much more highly developed than its Central American neighbors. \n\nPanama boasts a large expat community; about 25,000 US citizens live in the country. It is worth spending some time reading up on Panama and communicating with locals, expats and fellow travelers alike before arriving in the country.  Consider joining some local forums or blogs for expats or the Central America Forum. Many of the local blogs can give you the most current info on: floods, earthquakes, trail closings, and the best restaurant reviews.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nLess than 9 degrees north of the equator, most of Panama enjoys temperatures that are fairly consistent year round, with daytime temperatures in the 90s (30 - 33 °C) and nighttime around 70 (21 - 23 °C).

Airport taxis use set rates, and can be shared--the transportation information booth in the lobby will help you make arrangements.  There are a couple of hotels near the airport where you can spend the night at relatively high prices (US$60).\n\nIf you are short on cash you can catch a bus to the downtown of the city for .25 balboa. Just walk towards the highway and cross the street towards the bus shelter. Make sure you get the bus that says \"Via España\".\n\nThe country has more private airstrips per square mile than any other country in the world, and it is technically feasible for the adventurous private pilot to fly to one of them, either directly or through country hopping through Central America.  Many of the remote interior regions of the country are best accessed by private plane, although a combination of hiking and canoeing can get you to most places, too.  If you are flying a private aircraft into Panama, it is important to verify where you can clear customs and immigration--not all airstrips are equipped to clear you.\n\nBusiness jet FBO services are available in Panama City (Albrook and Tocumen), David (by appointment), Howard, and Bocas del Toro.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" From Costa Rica: You can drive across at Paso Canoas (Pacific side) which closes at 11PM (Panama side) or 10PM (Costa Rica side), but be aware that it is one of the busiest (if not the busiest) and disorganized border crossings in Central America.

The various offices at the border are randomly scattered throughout the bordertown, and you can do quite a bit of trekking while finding them, as they don't look distinct from the surrounding buildings in any way.

Most of them, like in the USA require appointments to service your car. Most of the service personnel in all of the car dealers are manufacturer certify. If you need car repairs and do not want to go to a dealer to save some money or you have an emergency repair, you can find good independent mechanic services\/shops in all of the major cities by looking in the yellow pages(paginas amarillas), in addition to towing services. If you need parts for your vehicle, you can find a great number of autopart stores for all major car manufacturers in the yellow pages (paginas amarillas)too. \n\nThe use of \"shade tree mechanics\" and parts from junkyards are the same as in the USA; these options are for do-it-yourself type of persons.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nYou can't cross from Panama to Colombia by bus--the Darien Gap begins at Yaviza, where the Interamericana runs out. \n\nIf you're coming in from Costa Rica, however, things will be a bit easier.

The trip from San Jose is quite cheap, but takes about 18 hours.  If you want to see things in between, you can also go by local buses, although the trip will take much longer. \n\nIf you want to save time yet not pay US$280 or so for a SJO-PTY airplane ticket with COPA or TACA, you could consider taking the bus from San Jose to Changuinola and fly from there to Panama city.  That flight takes about one hour and costs US$110 (Nov. 2011).  Check the website of Aeroperlas.com for flight schedules.  \n\nKeep in mind that Panamanian law requires you to have a return ticket to get into Panama.  The border guard may not check, but you never know.  A return flight from San Jose, Bogotá or Abu Dhabi won't work.  The return ticket has to originate from within Panama.  If you run into this problem, you can always buy a return ticket from the bus driver.  In general, if you're having a hot-tempered day, it may not be a good day to cross any borders.

They're pretty frequent, and the buses will pick you up or drop you off at any point along their route, and most of them are air conditioned.  The roughly linear shape of the country makes it ideal for a bus system, so ideal in fact that you don't really need to rent a car to get around most areas.  Take a bus to the intersection on the Pan American highway that you want. You can get on a bus any place on the Pan American highway going towards Panama City, but all trips originating from within the city require a ticket. The Grand Terminal in the city is large and modern, and will remind you of an American shopping mall or airport (it actually is a shopping mall, Albrook Mall, too).

The locals are very helpful with tourists on buses, and may offer help. \n\nThe highway buses are very cheap, count on a fare of about US$1 per hour traveled, sometimes less.

Unlike the urban taxis you may be used to, they can take you way out into the country.\nA taxi ride from Tocumen airport to Panama City, at a minimum of US$30, can easily exceed your taxi fares for the rest of your trip combined.   If you share a taxi ride with other passengers going from the airport to the city, your fare per person can be cheaper, at around US$12.

The road system of Panama is in very good condition (for Central and South American standards). You can rent a car and drive it around the country if you are an excellent defensive driver. While traveling by car you can discover attractions that are hard or impossible to reach with public transportation. \n\nPanama City is more difficult to navigate than any big city in the United States, with terrible traffic jams at rush hours, few signs for names of streets, poor street design, and a lack of traffic lights at busy intersections. You must be aggressive about positioning your car to get anywhere, yet highly alert to erratic and irrational behavior by others. Drivers have little respect for or even knowledge of traffic laws, and drivers from North America or Western Europe will be stunned by their recklessness. In the rest of the country, driving is mostly stress-free.\n\nThe Pan American Highway is paved for the entire length of the country, and has many roads which branch off to towns off the highway, most of which are paved, and most of the rest are still easily navigable in a sedan. However, road engineering standards are low, so be on the lookout for off camber turns, deep potholes, and sharp turns with no warning. It is highly recommended to drive well informed about your route. Use the detailed information which ",{"type":"''","value":["cochera andina"]}," provides on its site when planning your trip and check out road conditions, distances and travel times. On the road, don’t forget to take also a good road map with you. \n\nFor driving in Panama you need the driver’s license of your country but to avoid trouble at police controls it is better to have an international driver's license with you as well. The traffic rules are almost the same as in Europe or the U.S. Road signs are frequent. The speed limits are 40 km\/h within cities, 80 km\/h outside and 100 km\/h on the highways.

In less than five days you can visit it all: beach, mountain, modern city and historic ruins. While in Panama city don't miss the four \"must do\": the Panama Canal, Panama Viejo, Casco Antiguo (also known as Casco Viejo) and the jungles surrounding the Canal area. \n\nPanama Viejo was the first city of Panama, founded by the Spanish back in 1519. It was the first city founded at the Pacific and it became rapidly a prosperous point where gold from the southern colonies would make it to the Caribbean and later on to Europe. It was attacked by pirates several times, the last of them by Pirate Henry Morgan who destroyed it forever in 1671. In 1673, a new city was built, but this time using the knowledge painfully acquired by experience. The Spanish by then knew well the risks of settling cities in tropical swamps: mosquitoes, tropical diseases and difficulty to defend its territory. The second city was founded at the opposite side of the bay in very different conditions: a rocky peninsula easy to defend and with crossed winds that would ensure the health of its inhabitants. This city is known today as Casco Antiguo, and it is here where the Republic of Panama was born as it is known today. \n\nCurrently a UNESCO protected site, Casco Antiguo (or Casco Viejo) is Panama City's second touristic destination and the reason is that its buildings reflect the diversity of Panamanian society. Although a Spanish colonial city, because of several fires and the influence of merchants from all around the world, it became a vibrant city with styles ranging from Caribbean to French and even Art Deco. Today, Casco Antiguo undergoes an interesting revitalization process. Boutique hotels have started to appear, and some of the best bars and restaurants of the city can be found here. It has also become Panama City's artistic center with the recurrent art events and shows such as the Panama Jazz Festival, the Music Festival, Sobresaltos Dance Festival and many others. \n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Parque Soberania"]]},", Parque Chagres and Parque Metropolitano: fifteen minutes away from modern Panama City, you'll be able to hike primary and secondary tropical rainforests. There are several activities you can do here, from birdwatching at Gamboa's Pipeline Road to fishing at the Gatun Lake or visits of the caves at Madden. For those interested in research, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute offers visitors educational tours to Barro Colorado Island, one of the most studied jungles in the world.\n\nA visit to the Panama Canal is probably the most important item in the traveler's list. There are several ways you can experience the canal, it will depend on your level of interest. For the curious visitor, there are two museums devoted to it: the Canal Museum at Casco Antiguo, featuring Panama's history as a crossroads of cultures, oceans and a bridge between continents and a second museum is located at the Miraflores Locks. This museum shows the technical aspects of the Canal. You can observe the transits at the balcony of the restaurant on the top. \n\nAnother way to experience the Canal is to cross it. Either partial crossing which takes four hours or complete crossing which might be done in eight, in both cases it is recommendable to hire a guide that is knowledgeable in history of the Panama Canal.\n\nAn interesting twist on viewing the Panama Canal is to travel the length by train. The Panama Railroad was first built in 1855 and then rebuilt in 1909 during construction of the Panama Canal. For many years the railway provided an invaluable link between the Atlantic and Pacific. Ocean to Ocean by railway, the trip will take one day and transits through the tropical jungle.\n\nAlthough the Panama Canal is the most famous destination in Panama, travel outside the City is growing in popularity.

Because a legal treaty (1904) between US and Panama the Panamanian coinage is completely interchangeable with standard US coinage in Panama.  You may get a handful of change back with a conquistador on the quarter and an Indian on one of your pennies, but Lincoln on the other penny and Roosevelt on the dime.

Incidentally, if you run short on change in the United States, Panamanian coins work in parking meters, payphones, vending machines, etc.\n\nYou can typically use a credit card at all hotels in the capital, as well as medium-sized regional cities (David, Las Tablas, Colon, Santiago, Bocas del Toro, etc.).  Restaurants, grocery stores, and department stores in major cities will also usually take credit, or even debit cards.  However, outside the capital using your card could be difficult. \n\nThough Panamanian ATMs function on the Cirrus\/Plus system, they may not take cards with the Interlink symbol.  Make sure you're carrying a lot of cash (especially small bills) and understand how to take cash advances out on your credit card.  Traveller's checks are not widely used.\n\nMany businesses do not accept US$50 or US$100 bills at all. Most of those that do will ask for your passport and store your data\/serial numbers of your notes in a special book. The reason is that many US$50 and US$100 bills have been counterfeited.\n\nThere are 91 banks in Panama ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.panamaforum.com\/panama-banks\/9372-panama-banks-complete-list.html"]},".  Opening hours vary widely from bank to bank.  On weekdays, all banks are open until at least 3PM, and some until 7PM  On Saturdays many banks are open until noon, and some branches located in shopping centers are also open on Sundays.

There are Arabic restaurants, Italian, Chinese, Indian, Mexican... whatever you're in the mood for. \n\nOutside of the cities, the selection is largely Panamánian with bountiful seafood and beef due to the abundance of cattle farms and the fantastic fishing in the area.  Panamanian cuisine is a mix of several cultures.  Reminiscent of the country's Afro-Caribbean, French and Spanish influences, the dishes take on a complete character of their own.  If you get tired of eating beans or gallo pinto in the rest of Central America, you might want to head towards Panama.  Since Panama has a little more Caribbean influence than other Central American countries, you'll see a lot more plaintain than beans here. Most dishes are served with coconut rice and a type of squash or other native vegetable. If Panamanian food has to be summed up in one word, that word would be culantro, which is a local plant that tastes like cilantro, except that it has a much stronger flavor.  \n\nA typical plate in a humble, family restaurant can range from $1.25 up to 5.00, including your choice of meat: mondongo (beef stomach), fried or baked chicken, pork, beef and sometimes fried fish; rice, beans, salad: cabbage, carrot & mayonnaise; beet salad; green salad; potato or macaroni salad; and patacones (fried green plantains). The Panamanians also enjoy their \"chichas\" (fruit, water & sugar), of which there is always a selection, ranging from tamarindo, maracuya  (passionfruit), mango, papaya, jugo de caña (sugar cane juice), or agua de pipa (juice from young green coconuts). If you like your food picante, Panama may not be the place for you.  They definitely have several hot sauces, but the emphasis is not on the heat.  \n\nYou can get excellent food really cheap if you look around.  A quick and cheap lunch can be found at the so-called ",{"type":"'''","value":["Fondas"]},", which are small eateries located near schools, sports stadiums and in industrial areas where workers and students will have their afternoon meal. There are often several of these Fondas clustered together so just look for the one with the longest line and you can count on it having the best food for the money. A full plate of rice and beans with a large piece of chicken and a small salad will cost around $2-$2.50 plus the cost of a Coke (Squirt is very popular with lunch). If you chose to eat your food at the Fonda you will be given a real plate and actual silverware as well as a glass bottle of soda with a straw (be sure to return the empty bottle). The local food is far more tasty than the typical Subway sandwich, Whooper or KFC meal and a lot cheaper. If you eat at the same location often enough you will move from the status of a crazy gringo who must have gotten lost on the way to the Burger King to just another one of the locals enjoying lunch and casual conversation (in an industrial area the patrons will be mostly men and the subject of conversation mostly football and women). \n\nThe equivalent of a 5-star meal with drinks can be US$8-30 in some places.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nNational beers are produced (Balboa, Atlas, Soberana, Panamá), but don't measure up to a good import.

If you want a more relax bar, Sahara or The Londoner both offer retro music and pool tables.\n\nAnother great spot for \"bar hopping\" is Zona Viva in the Amador Causeway. Zona Viva is a closed off area so it is very easy for you to find everything in one place. You will find here clubs such as Jet Set Club, the Building, the Chill Out Zone, X Space, etc. \n\nCasco Viejo is a more cultural zone of Panama. Art galleries in the area coordinate Art Block parties once a month and there are always exhibits. The National Theater offers ballets, opera, and concerts weekly.
