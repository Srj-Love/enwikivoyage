Spanish is spoken by most, and many speak some form of English. Customer service is slowly improving, and surprisingly dismal in hotels.  However, on the streets, Panamanians are for the most part extremely friendly and helpful and would love to give you some advice.\n\nThere's great shopping, from high-end stores in the malls around Paitilla and in the banking district around Via Espana, to veritable bargains around La Central (Central Avenue, now turned into a pedestrian walkway) and the Los Pueblos outdoor mall. You can also find many ethnic stores (mostly Chinese and Indian), in certain parts of the City.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Tocumen International Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["PTY"]]},") is just outside Panama City (it's part of the San Miguelito district, which has been incorporated as a separate city but essentially exists as part of Panama City).  The airport is a hub for Copa Airlines, and is also served by American Airlines (Dallas\/Ft.Worth, Miami), Delta Airlines (Atlanta, Georgia), United Airlines (Houston, Newark), Avianca (Bogotá, Colombia) and TACA (San José, Costa Rica and San Salvador, El Salvador).  Most major Central American airlines, and several South American airlines and European Airlines also serve the city. There are at least six daily flights to and from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Miami"]]},", two from Orlando and Atlanta, and three daily flights from Houston, 1 from Los Angeles LAX, two from Newark, and 1 from New York's JFK. There are daily flights to Mexico City; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Port-au-Prince, Haiti; Caracas, Venezuela; Santiago, Chile; Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, Brazil; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Asunción, Paraguay; Havana, Cuba; Kingston, Jamaica, at least 7 Colombian cities (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Medellín"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cali"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pereira"]]}," and Bogotá included) and several international destinations. There's also service to Madrid, Spain, and service to Amsterdam with KLM.\n\nGetting to the city center from Tocumen is unfortunately not easy. Taxis cost $30, which can be reduced to $10 if you can find two other people to share with. Depending on traffic, the trip can take well over an hour.\n\nIf you don't want to pay for a taxi, there are modern, air-conditioned buses which cost $1.25 to get to the city center from the airport, but as of February, 2012, the buses only accept fare cards, not cash, and in April, 2012, there was still no place to buy fare cards in the airport. However, the bus is always full of people going to and from the airport, so you can probably find someone willing to pay your fare with their card; you can pay them back in cash. Take the bus going to Albrook, from the bus stop that is across the street, farther from the airport, by the billboards. To get there, turn right as you exit the terminal, follow the fence along to the right, cross the small parking lot, and follow the (mostly) covered sidewalk the rest of the way -- or just follow people. It's no more than a 5-minute walk. There are at least two different bus routes that go to Albrook; take the one marked Corredor Sur if at all possible for a half hour trip (depending on traffic), or take the local bus (Via España) for a slow (at least 1.5 hr) trip. You can buy a fare card at the Albrook transit center once you get there.  There is a $2 fee for the card.\n\nGetting back to the airport, you can catch a bus at the 5 de Mayo station. Heading down the stairs in the pedestrian underpass to the bus station, want to go left to platform 1, doors 'C' (corredor sur to Tocumen). At 4pm on a weekday there can be a substantial wait and the ride takes 50min due to rush hour.\n\nAlso, forget anything you may have heard about the red devil buses--they no longer serve the airport, although they are still common in the city.\n\nDomestic flights leave out of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Gelabert\/Albrook Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["PAC"]]},"), a former US military airfield (Albrook Air Force Base).

It's mostly a freight train, but it has a very nice passenger car.  The train ride offers excellent views of the Panama Canal and the tropical rainforest.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nCar travel in Panama City is notoriously difficult. During weekday work hours, traffic jams are continuous. Many street intersections lack traffic signals creating right-of-way confusion. Short distances may be quicker on foot or other means of transportation. During holidays like Carnival the traffic can be expected to be worse.\n\nCar rentals are available from major corporations like Hertz at Panama's Tocumen International Airport.\n\nAll taxis in Panama are required to be painted yellow by law. Hitch hiking is not uncommon.\n\nCheck points run by the national police occur at strategic locations to prevent the movement of illegal persons and goods.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nPanama City has one of the most modern bus terminals of whole Latin America. It's the main hub and well organized. The terminal is next to the Albrook airport (the domestic terminal) and it is very easy to find a bus here. All of the international buses (\"tica buses\" too) start and ends in this terminal. Arrivals are usually on the top floor and you can transfer to city buses on the lower level.\n\nThere are two proximity cards you may want to buy here: within the terminal you will probably need a \"RapiPass\" card, sold at various places throughout the terminal, to actually get on the buses (it's just 10 cents and the machines take coins and bills). You can also use that card to pay the $0.25 for bathroom use. For Panama City buses (e.g., to the airport), you'll need to buy a MetroBus card (fee is $2) at the orange\/yellow booth by the central stairs. You'll probably have to wait in a long line, but it moves fast. As of February 2014, there is also a new RapiPass 3en1 card for metrobus, terminal and metro.\n\nThe adjacent mall offers practically all that a traveler may want: showers, cinemas and plenty of shopping, etc.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Bus Lines"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ticabus.com\/mapa_ing.html Tica Bus"]}]}]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By metro"]},"\nPanama City is currently building the city's first subway system, which is intended to alleviate the city's vehicle traffic problem planned to open March 5, 2014.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:08-130Miraflores-NYK DIANA - Flickr - Salvador.C.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Miraflores locks, Panama Canal"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nOne of the easiest ways to get around town is by taxi.  Taxis do not have a meter.  Fares are set by the authorities, and are determined based on what section of the city you are starting at and what section of the city you are going to, with a surcharge for every additional person.  The cab driver should have a table (which may include a map) that will show the costs for the fare, and they are required to show it to you if you ask or you can check ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.transito.gob.pa\/tarifas_taxi.php Autoridad del Tránsito y Transporte Terrestre"]},".\n\nFares are around $1.25 for travel within one zone, and the longest fares within the City at about $5.  Keep in mind that the former Canal Zone is in a different section, and it will be at least a $5 fare.  The surcharge for additional passengers should be $.50\/additional passenger, and there's also a $.40 surcharge if you call a cab (at least these were the prices a few years ago).  A taxi to or from the international airport typically costs $30 including tolls if you take the Corredor Sur highway.  A taxi to the Amador Causeway costs between $5 - $10.  Cab drivers do not expect tips, and they may pick up additional passengers along the way.  The rule is that unless there's little to no deviation from the first person's route, the first person picked up is the first person dropped off, otherwise they will ask if it's ok to pick up the other fare.  Cabs can also be rented for the day, and the fares again are set (probably around $20-$25).  In this case, they will expect a little extra (tip and\/or lunch).\n\nBeware, taxi drivers will frequently try to overcharge visitors, sometimes up to many times the actual price, and will not have or know about any table as mentioned previously. If you are clearly a visitor and asking for the price, chances are the driver will say whatever they think they can get away with and you can try haggling down. It can help to ask locals what the price should be then negotiate based on that.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:CASCO V 2.jpg"],["thumb"],["400px"],["Panoramic view, Casco Antiguo"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["Diablo rojo"]},"\nGetting around by bus is also cheap and convenient. Fares are $0.25 and the destination of the bus is written across the front windshield in large letters.  Buses are privately owned and drivers usually compete with each other for passengers.  For this reason, buses have colorful decorations to attract customers.  During rush hour some buses can get crowded, and it is not unusual to see 3 people seated on a 2-person bench and lots of people standing along the aisle. It is not advised to use buses during these hours.\n\nAs of 2013, the \"red devils\" have been phased out from the main city routes, but they still connect the city with outlying suburbs.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Metrobus"]},"\nThe city has begun replacing the flamboyant \"red devils\" with modern, air-conditioned city buses (\"",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.mibus.com.pa MetroBus"]},",\" look for the orange sign to find stops), but the red devils are still around.

There are tourist police aplenty in both neighborhoods but do not wander too far in these areas alone (even in the day) and certainly not in the evening (as of 2010 these areas are very safe, lots of activity and tourist traffic)\n\nStay out of El Chorillo, Santa Ana, Curundu and San Miguel.  It is very dangerous right now due to infighting between drug gangs. Tourists have been kidnapped right off the street. El Chorillo borders San Filipe so it is very easy to accidentally walk into it. When driving, car doors should be locked.\n\nLook both ways before crossing the street! Panamanian drivers are notoriously aggressive when the traffic allows and will not slow down for you even if you're lucky enough to find a crosswalk.  There's only one way to cross the road here.  Wait for a break in the traffic and walk.  Once you start, keep going.  Drivers will stop(99% of the time......).  Otherwise you'll be stuck for hours waiting.\n\nThe central neighborhoods of Marbella, El Cangrejo, Obarrio, San Francisco, and the Banking Area are generally the most safe. In any case, be careful of your belongings, even if sitting in a restaurant, as people have had things snatched without noticing it, especially when enjoying a glass too many of Panama's great wine selection. It is never a good idea to drink heavily and walk back to your hotel.\n\nA dumb tourist mistake is bragging aloud about how cheap things are when local wages are also much lower compared to Europe and North America.\n\nIt's always a good idea (in any country really) to spend a few minutes to find out exact taxi fares before taking a taxi and always have exact change for the correct fare. This avoids over-charging and problems with some drivers. Having to ask a taxi driver how much the fare is the equivalent to wearing a \"kick-me\" sticker on your shorts, as you're telling him you don't know. Some have paid $20.00 to get from El Dorado to Via Argentina, but the real fare for one person is $1.75.\n\nOutside of Multiplaza, Albrook and Multicentro are some very good looking Taxis. The drivers wear nice shirts and the Taxis have proper signs on the roof. The drivers will most likely ask you if you are interested. NEVER take these taxis. All they do is wait for foreigners and then charge 4x the price.\n\nSome taxis at the main bus station prey on visitors.  Never put your belongings in the trunk. Sit in the back seat along with your belongings and have your luggage firmly grasped while entering and exiting the vehicle; otherwise, they can drive away with your things while you are still trying to get in.  Lock the doors once inside.  Avoid and ignore anyone who approaches you to \"get a taxi for you\"; go to the curb to get one yourself.  At best they will want money for this \"service\" amounting to half the taxi fare; at worst, they are setting you up to be robbed with certain drivers with whom they work.  Lastly, the cabs are marked on the door with a unique registration number -- memorize it or write it down and secretly tuck it safely away on your person before entering any cab.\n\nNever lose your temper with taxi drivers or police (or anyone else really) no matter how bad you may find a situation or service in some places. Exert your rights politely but firmly.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Embassies"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Embassy of France, Panama City.jpg"],["thumb"],["Embassy of France, in the middle of the old city"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["Canada"]]},"  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Canada"],["url="],["email=panam@international.gc.ca"],["address=Torres de las Americas, Tower A, Piso 11, Punta Pacifica"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+507 294-2500"],["tollfree="],["fax=+507 294-2514"],["hours=M-F 8:30AM-1PM, visas M-Th 1PM-3PM"],["price="],["phoneextra=After hours emergencies 613 996-8885, 613 944-1310 TTY"],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["Egypt"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Egypt"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.mfa.gov.eg\/english\/embassies\/Egyptian_Embassy_Panama\/Pages\/default.aspx"],["email=egempa@hotmail.com"],["address=Calle 55, Casa #15, Zona 5 (El Cangrejo)"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+507 263-5020"],["phoneextra=+507 265-7235"],["phone2=+507 671-40015"],["phonetype2=After hours Emergencies"],["tollfree="],["fax=+507 264-8406"],["hours=M-F 09:00-17:00"],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["Greece"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Greece"],["url="],["email=greecepa@sinfo.net"],["address=Antiguo Edificio NCR, 3er piso, Calle Manuel Espinosa Batista y Entrada de la Via Argentina, El Dorado 6, 1918 Panama"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+507 263-0411"],["tollfree="],["fax=+507 263-5511"],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["Japan"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Japan"],["url=http:\/\/www.panama.emb-japan.go.jp\/"],["email="],["address=Calle 50 y 60E, Obarrio, Apartado 0816-06807, Panamá 1"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+507 263-6155"],["tollfree="],["fax=+507 263-6019"],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["United States"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=United States"],["url=http:\/\/panama.usembassy.gov\/"],["email=Panama-ACS@state.gov; Panama-visas@state.gov"],["address=Bldg 783, Demetrio Basilio Lakas Ave"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+507 207-7000"],["tollfree="],["fax=+507 317-5568"],["hours="],["price="],["phoneextra=+507 207-7030"],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Take a boat trip out to the islands off the coast of Panama City (Isla Taboga)."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Check out the birds and Chagres River in Gamboa."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Take a tour of the San Blas Islands"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Visit the forts of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Portobelo"]]},", a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["UNESCO World Heritage Site"]]},".
