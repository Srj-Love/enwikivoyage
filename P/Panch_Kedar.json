When the Pandavs went to the Himalayas, Shiv avoided them because they had killed so many people in the war. To avoid them He ran in the form of a Bull, and Bhim chased him. On being followed, the colossal Bull dived into the ground to resurface at other places. He left his hump at Kedarnath. But when he resurfaced, it seems that he had assumed human form and emerged at different areas in these mountains. His Face resurfaced at Rudranath. His Arms resurfaced at Tungnath. His Naval (torso, I guess) emerged at Madha Maheshwar. His Hair emerged at Kalpeshwar. \n \nThese temples of Panchkedar have been and are seats of Tapasyas for sages from time immemorial.
