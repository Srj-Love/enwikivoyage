Pangmapha is less touristy and has a more traditional feel than Pai while boasting some excellent natural caves and interesting hill tribe villages. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nPangmapha is in northwestern Mae Hong Son Province, along the border with Burma. Better known is Soppong, a small village in a small valley in the Pangmapha District. Soppong is on the main road, between Pai and Mae Hong Son on the Mae Hong Son Loop. The village is a trading and market centre for the many hill tribe villages that populate the area. There is a total of about 350 homes in the whole village area. The population is about 40% hill tribe (mostly Karen, Lisu and Lahu), 40% Burmese Shan, 20% Thai, as well as few Haw Chinese Muslim families.\n\nThe area does not presently attract too many visitors, in contrast to Pai, located 45 km away, which has become crowded with tourists and now contains more than 300 guesthouses and hotels. There are several guesthouses and restaurants in Pangmapha, but very few tourist-oriented businesses and shops, thus lending a traditional feel to the area. There are several ATM's in the village centre, but if your time is limited you might want to bring enough baht as they sometimes don't work for a several days due to failing connections. \n\nThe area offers fantastic DIY trekking in the abundance of mountains, caves, rivers, and jungle. Information on what to do and where to go is offered at \"Border Bar\" in the centre of the village, across from the market and bus stop, as well as at the guesthouses. The Cave Lodge has a particular abundance of information and organises a wide range of guided trips as well.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nBuses depart from Chiang Mai throughout the day, and are available as either a bus or minibus. The buses cost 95 baht, are fairly cramped, fan only, and take about 6-7 hours. The mini-buses, in contrast, cost 250 baht, have much more comfortable seats, are air-conditioned, and take 4-5 hours. They have racks on top for luggage, so you will not have to buy an extra seat for your backpack as you have to on some other routes. The schedule for the two are as follows:\n\nMinibus: 06:30 \/ 07:30 \/ 08:30 \/ 09:30 \/ 10:30 \/ 11:30 \/ 12:30 \/ 13:30 \/ 14:30\n\nRegular bus: 07:00 \/ 09:30 \/ 12:30\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nMotorbike rentals for 200 baht per day are available at the Castrol Bike Point shop. Motorbike taxi drivers linger right in front of the market, and they have established set fares to most possible locations (e.g., 70 baht to Tham Lot or the Cave Lodge). \n\nA car ride is available if you have lot of luggage or for small groups. The fare to the main cave or the nearby lodge is 300 baht.
