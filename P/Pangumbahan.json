During the 80s an Indonesian company began farming the eggs of these endangered species for commercial sale.  Fifty percent of the eggs excavated were sold for consumption and medicinal purposes. The other fifty percent were incubated, hatched and reintroduced to the wild.\n\nOn the 31st of March 2005 H.E. Mr. Ibrahim Yusuf signed the IOSEA Memorandum of Understanding on behalf of Indonesia. The IOSEA MoU is an intergovernmental agreement that aims to protect, conserve, replenish and recover marine turtles and their habitats of the Indian Ocean and South-East Asian region.  The Memorandum took effect in Indonesia on 1 June 2005.  In 2008 the Indonesian Government seized the turtle farm and turned it into a turtle sanctuary. \n\nEven with government intervention the turtle population at Pangumbahan beach is still under threat. Coastal development such as beach-front construction, land “reclamation” and increased tourism is threatening the turtles of Pangumbahan beach.  Since 2006, illegal hotels, surf camps, and shops have dotted the protected coast line. This is a green belt zone, where development is prohibited, to allow wildlife to return and re-establish itself.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\nThe Pangumbahan area is surrounded by forests with sightings of Macaques, Leaf Monkeys, Wild Boars, Otters, Monitor Lizards, and birds Kingfishers, Herons, Eagles, and other forest species like Pigeons, Fantails, and Sunbirds. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nBy Bus\nTravelers must catch the bus at the airport that takes you to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bogor"]]},", then board the Surade bus at Bogor bus station.
