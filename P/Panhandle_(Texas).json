Flat and dry, the steady prevailing winds can sometimes create mild dust storms, though modern farming techniques have much reduced the terrible dust storms which occurred during the \"Dust Bowl Days\" of the Great Depression.  The region is subject to extremes of temperature like much of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Great Plains"]]},". Temperatures regularly reach 100ºF (38ºC) during the summer, while the winters can bring snows and the occasional blizzard.  While the snows are not frequent, the prevailing winds can drive what little does drop across a large area of the plains until it finds something to pile up against, usually a town or city or a highway.  Drifting is generally the real hazard, rather than large quantities of snow as happen in the North and East of the U.S.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Regions"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["High Plains"]]}," - 180 degrees of sky, wheat and corn as far as the eye can see, and the rich legacy of pioneers and cowboys."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Llano Estacado"]]}," - The heart of Panhandle cotton country, with bustling ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lubbock"]]}," at its center."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Central Plains"]]}," - The Texas Heartland."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Northern Edwards Plateau"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:TXPanhandle.jpg"],["right"],["300px"],["Panhandle region of Texas"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Abilene"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Amarillo"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Big Spring"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Childress"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Clarendon"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Lubbock"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Plainview (Texas)"],["Plainview"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["San Angelo"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Wichita Falls"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Palo Duro Canyon"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Caprock Canyons State Park"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Buffalo Springs Lake"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Lake Meredith"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Lake Ransom Canyon"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Lake Alan Henry"]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nFor most outsiders visiting for the first time, the Panhandle represents a lot of what is expected of the state of Texas.

It is recommended, however, that you keep a close watch on the gas gauge as you travel the Panhandle because population centers are generally spread out over a wide distance, and not all of these towns possess gas stations. The ones which do tend to close at dusk or shortly thereafter, when planning an evening drive make sure you fill up before embarking.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Palo Duro Canyon"]]},", near Amarillo.

Wonderland Park ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.wonderlandpark.com"]}," in Amarillo, the largest privately owned park in the state, boasts more than 25 rides and attractions, including the Texas Tornado double-loop rollercoaster. Joyland Park ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.joylandpark.com"]}," in Lubbock features several carnival-style flat rides, but also has 3 rollercoasters and a variety of water rides.

Many of the towns in the area also possess small rodeo arenas where competition generally takes place on the weekends. \n\nFor avid football fans, high school football in Texas is something not to be missed. It enjoys a stature in Texas that is unrivaled in any other state and has been the subject of many feature films, books, and television shows. For a look at the real fervor that can surround the sport, one should make time to catch a game in one of the smaller towns, where it is often the most prominent diversion in the community. In towns with especially sparse populations, a six-man version of the game is played which is delightfully fast paced and high scoring. Games generally occur on Friday night, and most communities post their respective school's schedule at local restaurants and other establishments.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nA visit to ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Big Texan Steak Ranch"]}," is a must for any Amarillo visitor.

Few of them advertise, so a keen eye is the best way to find them. \n\nAlso, if one is looking for traditional Mexican food, avoid the large chain restaurants and find a small one. These restaurants are usually owned and operated by a single family, with much of the food and trimmings prepared from scratch.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nSince the Panhandle is largely rural, crime is virtually nonexistent outside of the major cities. The weather, however, does require some vigilance, as the region often experiences the widest weather extremes in the state. Panhandle winters can be surprisingly brisk, and the areas at the far north end can receive significant snowfall during the winter months. Conversely, summertime high temperatures routinely top 100ºF (38ºC). Pack and dress accordingly.\n\nAlso, the Panhandle is at the tail end of Tornado Alley. It is wise to pay attention to weather reports during the spring storm season, which runs generally from March through early June.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Texas"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usableregion"]]},"\n\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Panhandle, Texas"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Texas Panhandle"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North_America\/United_States\/Texas\/Regions\/Panhandle\/"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["35.483333333333"],["-101.4"]]}]
