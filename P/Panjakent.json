It lies at the entrance to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zeravshan"]]}," Valley, one of Tajikstan's main tourist attractions. Around the modern town and in its museum you will find remains of the pre-Islamic, Zoroastrian civilization.\n\nThe remains of this Sogdian city are just out of town, on a hill overlooking the valley. You can wander around the site without being bothered by anyone. Unfortunately,there are hardly any signs explaining what is what. The director of the museum just next to the site is able to explain everything in detail though. You may also find some excavators here, and students from St. Petersburg willing to tell you about their work and finds. \n\nThe town has a another small museum with Soviet memorabilia and stuffed animals as well as impressive finds from the excavations nearby -- wall paintings from the 5th century, with faded colors but recognizable motifs and hunting scenes. \n\nYou can also do excellent treks in the surrounding Fan Mountains and further up the Zeravshan Valley. Penjikent is usually visited from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Samarkand"]]}," as part of a tour along the Silk route, other entry points are Dushanbe in the South or Khujand in the North. For the latter routes, you will have to cross high passes though. This means that Penjikent is often isolated from the rest of the country during wintertime.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nThe name Panjakent is derived from \"panj\" (five) and \"kant\" (settlements), meaning \"five settlements\". ",{"type":"''","value":["Rudaki"]},", the founder of Persian-Tajik literature called \"Adam of poets\", was born in Panjakent.\n\nThe ruins of ancient Panjakent are situated in the ",{"type":"''","value":["Zarafshan Valley"]}," about 60 km  east of Samarkand. Panjakant was the easternmost city of ",{"type":"''","value":["Sogdia"]},". The site is being excavated from 1947 onwards. Excavations were led by Y.Yakubovsky, A.Belenitsky and B.Marshak of the Ermitage Museum in St. Petersburg. Due to the long period of excavations, Panjakant has become one of the most thoroughly studied early medieval cities in all Asia. Excavations show that Panjakant was founded in the 5th cent and was inhabited until the 770s. \n\nPanjakent is famous for the outstanding frescoes. Today, a few of them are exhibited in the small Rudaki Museum at Panjakent, but most of them are exhibited in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dushanbe"]]}," and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ermitage"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["St. Petersburg"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["History"]},"\nAncient Panjakent was a town of the ",{"type":"''","value":["Soghdians"]},". The Soghdians were a people of an Iranian language. They belonged to the most important peoples in Central Asia before arrival of the Islam. The name ",{"type":"''","value":["Soghd"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["Soghdian"]}," is mentionned in historical sources of the Achaemenid Empire (6th cent BC). The Soghdians founded several city-states in the Zarafshan Valley and colonies along the Silk Road from the Crimea to China and Mongolia. Ancient Panjakent was the capital of the state of ",{"type":"''","value":["Panch"]},". The town dates to the 5th cent. AD. It was inhabited by rich merchants and land-owners. The Arabs conquered Panjakent in 722. The last ruler, named ",{"type":"''","value":["Devashtich"]},", fled into the mountains, but he was captured and sentenced to death. People stayed in Panjakent under the rule of the caliphate, but towards the end of the 8th century, the city was abandoned.\n\nYaqub Beg was born in the town in the early 19th century when it was part of the Khanate of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kokand"]]},". He joined the Khan's army as a young man and later commanded it as it vigorously, but in the long run unsuccessfully, resisted Russian expansion in the area. Later he took much of the army east, took ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kashgar"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yarkand"]]}," in what is now ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Xinjiang"]]},". He ruled a substantial kingdom from Kashgar for about a decade, but then he died (assassination, suicide and a stroke have all been given as the reason) and the kingdom fell apart.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nMost visitors enter Panjakent and the Zeravshan valley from ",{"type":"''","value":["Samarkand"]},", which is just across the border to Uzbekistan. You will need a valid Tajik visa to enter and a double\/multi-entry Uzbek visa if you intend to return the same way you came. There is no public transport crossing the border and unless you have arranged your trip through one of the many Uzbek tour agents, you will have to switch taxis at the border. Taxis leave from Pandjakent Koutchasi, the south eastern part of the Registan. The trip to the border takes about 30 minutes and costs US$3 per person. From the border, the trip takes another 30 minutes and costs another US$3 per person. Travel agents at Samarkand organize the trip for about US$40 (including transportation, guide, admission fee and \"border crossing fee\").\n\nWarning: as of January 2012, the Samarkand-Panjakent border crossing is closed, with no signs of opening in the future.\n\nFrom ",{"type":"''","value":["Khujand"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["Dushanbe"]},", it is a spectacular but exhausting 7-10h trip to Panjakent in shared taxi.

There is one bus line (not surprisingly bearing the number 1), which is running along the main Road (Rudaki) connecting the far ends of this small city.

The site is huge. Located on the top of a hill, it offers amazings views over the entire valley. The living quarters and fortress were separated by a narrow wadi with a bridge connecting the two parts of the city. \n\nTwo ",{"type":"''","value":["temples"]}," in the shakhrestan formed the center of the urban area. The two temples contained statues and mural paintings. During the 5th and 6th centuries, no building in Panjakent was as magnificient as the two temples and even the houses of the wealthiest residents seemed rather humble compared to the two temples. \n\nThe buildings were made of mud bricks and paksha. The ",{"type":"'''","value":["residential houses"]}," ranged from single room buildings to large estates, reflecting the social status of their inhabitants. In the 7th and 8th centuries, the hoses of the rich dominated the architecture of the city. At the beginning of the 8th century, the spaces between the houses were converted into passageways and often covered with vaults. The houses of the rich became two-story buildings with vaults over the room on the first floor. All residential houses were covered with wall paintings and woodcarvings. \n\nThe larger houses consisted of ",{"type":"''","value":["halls"]}," with four columns and benches along the walls. They were the most important part of the houses and served religious purposes. More than a third of the hoses had such ",{"type":"''","value":["reception halls"]},". It is here where the archaologists discovered many exceptional ",{"type":"''","value":["mural paintings"]},". These paintings date from the 5th to the 8th century and are considered the most important works of early medieval art in Central Asia before the arrival of Islam. Most houses had a dark vaulted room for storage and a spiral staircase leading to the living quarters in the second floor. The houses of the well-to-do population usually had a room with a fire altar and a ceremonial hall decorated with wall paintings and wood carvings. In the main hall, there was a ",{"type":"''","value":["niche"]}," up to 4 m widr opposite the entrance with giant images of tutelary gods and small pictures of the praying members of the household. The center of the hall was marked by four wooden columns which supported complex wooden structures with a dome on a square foundation on the top. The hall was decorated with woodcarvings in high relief and even with small statues of caryatids and atlantes. The most common motif of the reliefs in the ceiling were arched niches with figures of the gods, including the sun-god in his chariot. The wall paintings on the other three walls were much smaller than the gods facing the main entrance. They formed two or three friezes depicting royal feasts, hunting scenes, the heroic deeds of ",{"type":"''","value":["Rostam"]},", local heroes, amazons or persons from the Indian epic Mahabarata. The layout of the Sogdian central hall is unique. The decorations show that the Sogdian artist were familiar with the artistic and literary traditions of different cultures, as Persia, Greece and even India. \n\nThe majority of the population observed some local variation of ",{"type":"''","value":["Zoroastrianism"]},", which is proved by the wide distribution of ossuary funerals and fire-altars. There is, however, some evidence of the presence of Christianity and Buddhism and eventually even of the cult of Shiva. Zoroastrianism was combined with cults of additional gods and goddesses. Not all of these deities were of Iranian origin, as can be seen from the cult of the Mesopotamian goddess Nana. \n\nThe iconography of these goods can be traced back to the Hellenistic period, e.g. the image of a defeated goddess. It was also influenced by Sasanian ideas of the royal attributes of gods and observed some Hinduistic features as well. The iconography took its final form in the 5th and 6th centuries. Each household had its own divine protector, but all gods formed part of a single pantheon, as can be seen from wall paintings depicting several deities side by side. The three-headed god of the wind ",{"type":"''","value":["Veshparkar"]},", who resembles Shiva, and the four-handed ",{"type":"''","value":["Nana"]}," riding on a lion or seated on a throne in the shape of a lion can easiliy be recognized. Altogether, more than 20 deities can be found on small terracotta images, murals, woodcarvings and clay figurines. The images of Nana, a god sitting on a throne in the shape of a camel and of a god standing over a fallen demon are most common."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Rudaki Museum (Republican History and Regional Study Museum)"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=1km west of the City Administration on the main Rudaki street"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=8am - 5pm"],["price=US$10"],["content=This interesting museum of local history has recently been rehabilitated and should not be missed.
