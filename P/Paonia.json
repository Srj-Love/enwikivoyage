Incorporated in 1881, Paonia was named by its founder, Samuel Wade, for the peony rootstock which he brought with him by covered wagon. Wade submitted the Latin name for the flower, \"Paeonia\" as the official town name to the US Postal Service. Unfortunately, the Post Office wouldn't allow the extra vowel. So the name got shortened to \"Paonia.\"\n\nPaonia is a rich agricultural region with many orchards, organic farms and vineyards. In 2001, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms designated the mesas around Paonia as the \"West Elks American Viticultural Area.\" At 6,417 ft (1956 m) above sea level, this wine region is amongst the highest in the world.
