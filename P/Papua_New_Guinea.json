This comes from an archaeological site at Matenkupkum, just south of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Namatanai"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Ireland"]]}," province. Other archaeological digs at several locations in New Ireland have discovered tools and food residue dating back 20,000 years.  \n\nIn more modern times, Papua New Guinea (known popularly as 'PNG'), the eastern half of the island of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Guinea"]]}," (which is the second largest island in the world), was divided between Germany ('German New Guinea') and Great Britain ('British Papua') in 1884. The Dutch had West Papua, now the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Indonesia"],["Indonesian"]]}," territory of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Papua"]]},". The southeast part of the island, also known as Papua, was owned by the UK but administered by ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Australia"]]},", and thus a colony of a colony, until Australian independence in 1901, when it became an Australian colony. In 1914, the Australians did their part in the Allied war effort and took control of German New Guinea, and continued to administer it as a Trust Territory under the League of Nations and (later) the United Nations. However, it was not just disinterested colonialism. Gold had been discovered in several places and was rapidly exploited. Remnants of vast gold dredges can still be seen in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bulolo"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wau (Papua New Guinea)"],["Wau"]]}," area. \n\nDuring World War II, New Guinea was the site of fierce fighting on land (at Buin and on the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kokoda Track"]]},") and sea (at the Battle of the Coral Sea). It was the first place in the war where the Japanese advance was checked and then reversed. After the war, both New Guinea and Papua were administered from the government center of Port Moresby on the south coast, in Papua. In 1975, the country, now united as 'Papua New Guinea', achieved independence from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Australia"]]},". Today Papua New Guinea continues to be the foremost country in Melanesia. The country struggles to fulfil the dreams of independence as economic stagnation, corruption, law and order problems, and a nine-year secessionist revolt on the island of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bougainville"]]}," all conspire to make the country somewhat less than a tropical paradise.\n\nThe attempts by Bougainville to break away at the time of Independence led to a decision to offer the regions of the country a certain amount of political autonomy. Decentralization led to the establishment of nineteen provincial governments and the process of dividing up the country into unviable administrative units seems to be continuing, with a decision in 2009 to split both Southern Highlands and Western Highlands provinces into three new provinces. \n\nIn 2009, Papua New Guinea received 125,000 visitors, but only around 20% of these declared themselves as tourists. The country offers the traveller a true paradox. With little tourist infrastructure outside the main tourist areas, getting around can be tough. But Papua New Guineans themselves are wonderfully welcoming people who will go to great lengths to accommodate strangers. Tourism is well developed and growing in a handful of locations. Beyond these, the country is 120% adventure travel and not for the inexperienced or faint of heart.\n\nFor people who can make it out here, the experience is unforgettable. The incredible natural beauty is simply indescribable. Its unique flora and fauna includes enormous radiations of marsupials and birds, including the Raggiana bird-of-paradise (the national symbol) and several species of tree kangaroos. Untouched coral reefs compete with spectacular World War II wrecks for the attention of divers, and the hiking is out of this world. \n\nWith rugged terrain, inter-tribal mistrust, and diverse languages, intermarriage between the peoples has, until recently, been very limited. Physical and facial appearance varies significantly throughout the country; from those who look almost Polynesian in some coastal areas, through the short, stocky Highlanders, to the tall and statuesque people of the area around Rabaul in New Britain and the dark-skinned inhabitants of Bougainville, who could almost come from Africa.\n\nThe central highlands of Papua New Guinea were not mapped until the 1930s and not effectively brought under government control until the late 1960s. As a result, the people are as interesting as the geography, flora, and fauna. Papua New Guinea is a place that often markets itself as 'the Last Unknown' or a place where you can still find 'Stone Age People'. Of course, telling a Papua New Guinean that you consider them a stone age savage is incredibly rude. While you can, if you try hard enough, find old men who remember the first time they or anyone in their society saw ",{"type":"''","value":["metal"]},", you'll also have trouble finding anyone who has not seen ",{"type":"''","value":["Titanic"]},". Indeed, what makes Papua New Guinea so interesting today is not the fact that it is some sort of living museum, but its incredible dynamism. In the hundred-year shift from stone to steel to silicon, Papua New Guineans have turned the shortest learning curve in human history into one of the most colourful, and often idiosyncratic, experiments in modernity ever produced by human beings. Featuring ritual garb made of human hair and rolled up Instant Noodle wrappers, rap in Pidgin English, or tribal warriors named 'Rambo' for their valour in combat, Papua New Guinea's collision with global culture has been intense and fascinating. So don't worry about the fate of 'traditional culture': in the bar room brawl between Papua New Guinea and the global culture industry the biggest worry is keeping Papua New Guinea from pummelling global culture to a pulp.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nPapua New Guinea is just to the south of the equator and has a tropical climate. In the highlands, though, temperatures are distinctly cool. The (very) wet season runs from about December to March. The best months for trekking are June to September.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Terrain"]},"\nThe country is situated on the Pacific Ring of Fire, at the point of collision of several tectonic plates. There are a number of active volcanoes, and eruptions are frequent. Earthquakes  are relatively common, sometimes accompanied by tsunamis.\n\nThe country's geography is diverse and, in places, extremely rugged. A spine of mountains, the New Guinea Highlands, runs the length of the island of New Guinea, forming a populous highlands region mostly covered with tropical rainforest. Dense rainforests  can be found in the lowland and coastal areas as well as very large wetland areas surrounding the Sepik and Fly rivers. This terrain has made it difficult for the country to develop transportation infrastructure. In some areas, aircraft are the only mode of transport. The highest peak is Mount Wilhelm at 4,509  m (14,793 ft). Papua New Guinea is surrounded by coral reefs which are under close watch to preserve them.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Read"]},"\nThere are many great books about Papua New Guinea, including great fiction as well as non-fiction. An excellent book for the general reader about Papua New Guinea is Sean Dorney's ",{"type":"''","value":["Papua New Guinea: People, Politics, and History Since 1975"]},". The third edition is the best, but it is pretty hard to find outside of Australia (and is not that easy to find there).\n\nJohn Laurel Ryan, a former employee of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), also wrote an excellent book, \"The Hot Land\" which was published about 1970.  Among other fascinating historical information it contains accounts of various manifestations of cargo cult, John Teosin's \"baby garden\" on Buka Island, and eye-witness reports that have been rigidly suppressed in other media about the Indonesian takeover of what was formerly Dutch West Papua.  This excellent and at times disturbing book will also be hard to find, and sadly its author even harder!\n\nThere is also a lot of anthropological work that has been done in Papua New Guinea (leading some to term the area an \"anthropologist's laboratory\"), which can contribute greatly to an understanding of the different groups in the region. Some of the more accessible volumes include Malinowski's \"Argonauts of the Western Pacific\", centred on the Trobriand Islanders, living just north of Papua New Guinea itself; Reading the skin - Michael O'Hanlon; Coaxing the spirits to dance - Welsch, Webb et al.; The Art of Kula - SF Campbell; Inalienable Possessions - AB Weiner.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["People"]},"\nPapua New Guinea has hundreds of ethnic groups and is arguably one of the most heterogeneous countries in the world.

There are flights to villages on the Kokoda trail and others in the Owen Stanley mountain range in Central Province and you can fly a scheduled circuit or \"milk run\" in one morning, although you will have to be at the airport by 05:00. Check with ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.apng.com\/ ",{"type":"''","value":["Airlines PNG"]}]}," for schedules. Fane, Ononge and Tapini strips are particularly scary. Remember your life assurance.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nThere is not so much shopping in the regular sense. In the major cities there are a few malls and supermarkets. Otherwise, most of the shopping is done in small markets that are held irregularly. A great place to visit is the craft market which is held once per month in Port Moresby opposite Ela beach in the car park of the IEA TAFE College. There it is possible to buy handicrafts from every part of the country. Although it is slightly more expensive than out in the villages, the prices are very reasonable. Haggling is not really an accepted custom, one can haggle a bit but to do it excessively could annoy the locals.\n\nDon't buy bird feathers.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Currency"]},"\nThe kina (ISO 4217 code: ",{"type":"'''","value":["PGK"]},") is the currency of Papua New Guinea and divided into 100 toea.\n\nIn September 2013, €1 = PGK3.05\n\nPolymer banknotes in denominations of 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 kina circulate.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nThe food is largely devoid of spices. A typical way of cooking is a ",{"type":"''","value":["Mumu"]},", an underground oven in which meat and vegetables, such as ",{"type":"''","value":["Kaukau"]}," (sweet potatoes), are cooked. In just about every meal, there is rice and another form of starch. \n\nIn the lodges that tourists stay, in there is usually a blend between this type of food and a more Westernised menu.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nThere are brands of local beer. The local brew, SP (short for South Pacific) Lager, is owned by Heineken. Excessive alcohol consumption, primarily of beer, is a major social problem. Beers and wines are often served fairly warm due to a lack of refrigeration in certain areas. Also, while the water quality varies from place to place (and in some cases from day to day), it is generally best to stick to bottled water, even in the upper-market hotels.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nPapua New Guinea offers a wide choice of accommodation for tourists with very little of it budget.\n\nHotels are very expensive (about USD100\/night). Guesthouses are the best budget option in the towns but even then still expensive (about USD40\/night.) The least expensive option is to stay in village guesthouses (about USD15\/night), and that is where the fun is anyhow.\n\nPort Moresby has international hotels including the Crown Plaza and Airways International, mid range hotels such as Lamana and guesthouses. The regional areas offer International and budget hotels depending on the size of the town and some provinces have guest houses. There is a new eco-tourist lodge in Alotau called Ulumani Treetops Lodge, the place is beautiful overlooking the Milne Bay and offers a new bungalow or backpacker options.\n\nThere is a very expensive lodge (USD200\/night) that sits on the edge of Tari basin, called Ambua Lodge that is run by Australians. This lodge is \"an inspired mixture of local architecture, spectacular views and modest luxury off the beaten track.\" It is in the Tari Gap 2100 m in the Southern Highlands, which is the homeland of the Huli clan with their human hair wigs adorned with colourful flowers. It borders on the mid-montane rain forest and grasslands which gives a spring feeling all year round. This lodge won the 1991 Pacific Asia Travel Association's Pacific Heritage Award which cited it due to its \"superb example of culturally sensitive and ecological responsible tourism.\"\n\nA stone's throw down the road from Ambua Lodge is the more rustic Warili Lodge, which is run by locals, is only USD20\/night, and offers birdwatching as good as, or better, than that offered at Ambua Lodge.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Learn"]}," \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Work"]},"\nThere is a workforce of close to two million people in a few different industries.

However, actual gunfire in the capital is mercifully rare. If you plan on taking a tour of any city, make inquiries with your hotel or accommodation provider, as many will be able to either walk with you or drive you to wherever you are planning to go, or just around the local area if that is what you want to do. \n\nAvoid going out after dark, but if you must, stay very alert.\n\nFlying in small planes can be very risky. Hardly a year goes by without at least one fatal accident (the most recent in August 2009 when 12 people were killed). While the planes are usually well-maintained and the pilots technically proficient the problem is the mountainous terrain. Many smaller airfields are situated in steep valleys. When there is cloud cover planes have difficulty in finding them and sometimes crash into a mountain.
