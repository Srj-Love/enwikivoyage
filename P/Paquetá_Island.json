It was a very fashionable place at the beginning of the 20th century, where the Brazilian upper class would have parties and spend their weekends. However, in the 70s, Paquetá became unfashionable among the rich, and you will find that many upper class Brazilians will sneer at the idea of going there. Don't be discouraged by that: although you'll find that most visitors are low income Brazilians, it is a wonderful place to go.  Most of its houses date from the beginning of the 20th century, but there are some older constructions dating from the early 1700s, all of them well preserved. Also, the whole island was beautifully landscaped, with many cozy places to rest and enjoy nature.   Because of its size and the fact that it is accessible only by boat, Paquetá is one of the safest places in Rio de Janeiro, with virtually no crimes.  \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe island is a car-free zone, so travel is limited to bicycles and horse-drawn carriages. \n\nYou can get to Paquetá by ferry ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.grupoccr.com.br\/barcas\/linhas-horarios-tarifas\/#!\/paqueta"]},", departing in the mornings from Praça XV, downtown ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rio de Janeiro\/Centro"],["Rio de Janeiro"]]},".
