However, Paraguay has been experiencing an important increase in the tourism sector due to the opening of new hotels, new paved highways and the great efforts of the National Tourist Board to catch the attention of both local and international travellers.\n\nA major economic fact is that Paraguay is the world's fifth largest exporter of soya beans, so expect to see hundreds of square kilometres of soya plantations especially in the southeast, east and northeast regions.\n\nParaguay is also a renowned producer of beef, so do not be surprised to find cattle eating grass just a few centimetres from the highway, especially in the Chaco region and Misiones Department. Despite all this, Paraguay is South America's second-poorest country in per capita GDP terms and it is as common to see beggars asking for money on Asunción's intersections as it is in many other Latin American capitals.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:General view - Trinidad (Paraguay).JPG"],["thumb"],["Ruins of Jesuit missions in Trinidad"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Rioparaguay 0230.jpg"],["thumb"],["Paraguay river"]]},"\nThe original inhabitants of Paraguay were the indigenous. The ",{"type":"'''","value":["Guaraní"]}," were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practised subsistence agriculture. The Chaco region was home to other group of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.\n\nIn the 16th century Paraguay, formerly called \"The Giant Province of the Indies\", was born as a result of the encounter of Spanish conquerors with the native indigenous groups. The Spaniards started the colonization period which lasted for three centuries. Since the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to keep a lot of its indigenous character and identity. Nowadays, the ",{"type":"''","value":["mestizos"]}," (Spanish + Amerindian) account for more than 80% of the country's 6.6 million inhabitants and Guarani is, side by side with Spanish, the country's official language.\n\nIn the past, Franciscan and Jesuit missions mingled with the Guaranis' dream of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Yvy maraë´y"]},", a land without evil, and produced singular societies. The ",{"type":"'''","value":["ruins"]}," of the Jesuit Missions of La Santisima ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Trinidad (Paraguay)"],["Trinidad de Parana"]]}," and Jesus de Tavarangue, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["UNESCO World Heritage List"],["UNESCO World Heritage sites"]]},", and several villages throughout the country, are witnesses to that peaceful past. On 15 May 1811 a revolution ended the Spanish colonial rule and this day is celebrated as Paraguay's independence day.\n\nShortly after independence came the paranoid dictatorship of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia"]}," (1814-1840) who, convinced of plots to kill him, declared that the buildings in Asunción had to be low enough so that he could see who was on the roof while riding his horse and that at every street corner he should be able to see in all four directions so that would-be assassins would have nowhere to hide. The destruction of colonial buildings that didn’t fit in with this scheme robbed Asunción of some architectural gems.\n\nBut Paraguay also has a history of wars, having fought with all its neighbours. It was one of the richest countries in the mid-19th century (the only one in America to have railways at that time) before the disastrous 1865-70 War of the Triple Alliance. Paraguay was invaded by the allied forces of Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay and after 5 years of heavy fighting and utter destruction, the country surrendered. The result was the loss of two-thirds of all adult males and a great part of its territory.\n\nA unique event was the scene of the first ever attempt at Communism when 700 people sailed from Balmain, Sydney Australia in 1893 to found \"New Australia.\"  A split occurred soon after arrival when some of the arrivals started mingling with the local ladies who were suffering a lack of men due to the  War of the Triple Alliance.  Two-thirds of the immigrants eventually returned to Australia but around 2,000 Paraguayans can trace their heritage to Australia.\n\nTo complete the fighting with its neighbours, in the 1930s another war broke out, the Chaco War of 1932-35 engaged Paraguay with Bolivia over the possession of the Chaco region. When the war ended, large and economically important areas of the Chaco that belonged to Paraguay were given to Bolivia as part of the peace treaty of 1938.\n\nAfter World War II Paraguay received many immigrants, who fell in love with the people's hospitality and decided to stay and call Paraguay their home. New colonies of Germans, Russians, Italians, Ukrainians, Japanese and Mennonites were established in different parts of the countryside areas of Paraguay.\n\nThe 35-year military dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner was overthrown in 1989 and, despite a marked increase in political infighting in recent years, democratic governments have been in power since then. Modern Paraguay is largely based upon political uncertainty and economic hardship. Since the early 1980s, Paraguay is making the difficult decision to move to a more modern market economy. In recent years, the economy has grown and democratic elections have taken place. While ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Asuncion"]]}," is filled with new economic prospects and construction, much of the country remains underdeveloped, consisting of deficient infrastructure.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Geography"]},"\nWith a total surface area of 406,752 km², Paraguay is divided by the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Paraguay River"]]}," into two well-differientiated natural regions: the Eastern or Oriental Region and the Western or Chaco Region, each one with their own fauna, flora, and particular characteristics.\n\nAlthough Paraguay is landlocked, the country is watered by numerous rivers, streams, and lakes, which are all part of the Rio de la Plata river basin. The two principal rivers are the river Paraguay, which divides the country in two, and the river Paraná, which forms the frontier with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Paraná"]]}," state in Brazil and with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Corrientes"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Misiones"]]}," provinces in Argentina.\n\nOverall Paraguay is a quite flat country; while its western neighbours ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Argentina"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bolivia"]]}," include mountains higher than 6,000 m above sea level, the highest point in Paraguay is Cerro Tres Kandú with a height of 842 m.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nParaguay is generally hot for most of the year.

When it is hot, it is more common to drink it as ",{"type":"'''","value":["tereré"]},", served in guampas, which can be made out of wood or of hallow bull horns, and is drunk through a metal straw called a bombilla.\n\nMate is usually enjoyed in the early mornings and late evenings especially during cold days in winter. Terere is enjoyed year-round, though not during lunch time and past sunset, as many recommend. Still, you can see every type of Paraguayan (from construction workers to business executives) carry their tereré set during all times. It is a social activity so the cup is passed around - with in between a refill for each person. If you are offered either you should accept at least one cup. If you can get used to the taste and participate, locals will be appreciative.Often, herbs are added to the tereré water (locally called 'remedios' or 'yuyos', which cure different ailments). For example, adding coconut to one's mate is supposed to help with headaches. The taste is best described as earthy, like a bitter green tea, and it will take getting used to before you can enjoy it.\n\nDrinking mate or tereré is most definitely one of the social customs of Paraguay. Shops will close around noon for a siesta and for a round of mate\/tereré with friends.\n\nAnother variation of preparation is to boil the yerba on the stove with sugar then strain it before serving it with milk.
