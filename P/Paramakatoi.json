This is an extremely remote area.  Calling it a place to \"get away\" would be a great understatement.  It is more like stepping back in time and witnessing subsistence living.  There is no phone or internet service.  There are no restaurants.  Many people living here will have never seen an automobile.  Walking is the main form of transportation, and residents think nothing of walking for two days through the rain forest to make it to a neighbouring location.

Be sure to carry a passport as it may be required before departure or upon return.  During the dry season,  there is a trail from Lethem that is sometimes usable.
