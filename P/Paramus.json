There are three major malls: the Westfield Garden State Plaza, the Paramus Park Mall, and the Bergen Town Center.

Ironically, on any given weekend night except Sunday, the wait at each restaurant is ",{"type":"'''","value":["at least"]}," one hour long. Overall, Houston's seems to have the longest right now, as I've waited there for two hours before being seated.
