The highest peak is 1350 metres.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThis range is one of the most important pilgrimage centres for Jains. They call it Sammed Sikharji. The hill is named after Parasnath, the 23rd Tirthankara. Twenty of the twenty-four Jain Tirthankaras attained salvation on this hill. According to some, nine Tirthakaras attained salvation on this hill. For each of them there is a shrine (gumti or tuk) on the hill. Some of the temples on the hill are believed to be more than 2,000 years old. However, although the place is habited from ancient times, the temples may be of more recent origin.\n\nAbout 50,000 Jain pilgrims visit Sammed Shikharji every year.\n\nThe Santhals call it Marang Buru, the hill of the deity. They celebrate a hunting festival on the full moon day in Baisakh (mid April).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nBest time to visit is from October to March when the weather is pleasant.\n",{"type":"===","value":["By road"]},"\nParasnath Hill is on Grand Trunk Road NH 2.The nearby place for reaching Parasnath is Ranchi 190 KM, Bokaro 40 KM, Jhumri Tileya 80 km Dhanbad 60 KM and Hazaribagh 80 km\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By rail"]},"\nParashnath station on the Howrah-Delhi grand chord line is the base for a visit to Parashnath.

There is small station at ",{"type":"'''","value":["Nimiaghat"]}," from where also Parasnath Hill is accessible, but the said route is not the popular one, people only travel by this route once a year.

In view of the tourist volume, Parasnath station has been built as a model station by Indian Railways.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe summit of Parasnath Hill can be reached either from the southern or the northern side. There are two recognized routes to Parasnath Hill.\n\nThe southern  approach is from Isri Bazaar, to the top, is motorable for about 2 km, the rest being a climb of 8 km.\n\nThe northern approach is a 13 km route from Madhuban village on the Dumri-Giridih road. Madhuban is about 40 km from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Giridih"]]}," and about 10 km from Parasnath rail station\/ Isri Bazaar\/ Dumri, all on Grand Trunk Road (NH 2). Buses ply along this route from Dumri to Giridih and stop at Madhuban village. Hired cars or taxis are available at Isri Bazar, just outside the rail station. There are a number of Jain temples at Madhuban.\n\nAfter 3.5 km from Madhuban there is a stream called Gandharva nala and further up there is another stream Sita nala. The Jains hold the portion from Gandharva nala up to the summit as very sacred. It is easier to reach Parasnath from its northern side.\n\nPonies and dandis for the climb can be arranged at short notice. Jeeps and such power-driven vehicles can be hired to carry visitors for a considerable distance up the hill. Thereafter they have to walk.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Area landmarks"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Parashnath railway station"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat= 23.9879"],["long= 86.0375"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Nimiaghat railway station"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat=23.9322"],["long=86.0763"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\nNote: The attached map is slightly erroneous.
