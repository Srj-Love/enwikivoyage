The main draws to Parga are the historical castle which overlooks the town (from a headland to the west of the town) and the beaches. Near the town centre is Krioneri beach, to the west of the town (beyond the castle) is Valtos beach, and 4km to the west of the town is Lichnos beach. Despite its scenic beauty, tourism is rather new here and the number of foreign tourists is small. Resultantly, people are friendly and the town still feels genuinely Greek. The majority of tourists frequenting Parga are Greeks, although it is gradually becoming more popular among foreign tourists, especially during peak holiday times (namely, July and August).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThere are basically only two ways of getting to Parga, by bus, and by boat.

From the top you can see other villages near Parga, Corfu on a clear day, and the fortress of Parga which Ali Pasha tried to shoot with his cannons.
