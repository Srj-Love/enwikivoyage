Clovis' descendants, aka the Carolingians, held onto the expanded Lutetian state for nearly 500 years through Viking raids and other calamities, which finally resulted in a forced move by most of the population back to the islands which had been the centre of the original Celtic village.  The Capetian Duke of Paris was voted to succeed the last of the Carolingians as King of France, ensuring the city a premier position in the medieval world. Over the next several centuries Paris expanded onto the right bank into what was and is still called ",{"type":"''","value":["le Marais"]}," (The Marsh). Quite a few buildings from this time can be seen in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Paris\/4th arrondissement"],["4th arrondissement"]]},".\n\nThe medieval period also witnessed the founding of the Sorbonne. As the \"University of Paris\", it became one of the most important centres for learning in Europe—if not the whole world, for several hundred years. Most of the institutions that still constitute the University are found in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Paris\/5th arrondissement"],["5th"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Paris\/13th arrondissement"],["13th arrondissements"]]},".\n\nIn the late 18th century, there was a period of political and social upheaval in France and Europe, during which the French governmental structure, previously a monarchy with feudal privileges for the aristocracy and Catholic clergy, underwent radical change to forms based on Enlightenment principles of nationalism, citizenship, and inalienable rights. Notable events during and following the revolution were the storming of the Bastille ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Paris\/4th arrondissement"],["4th arrondissements"]]},", and the rise and fall of Napoleonic France. Out of the violent turmoil that was the French Revolution, sparked by the still known ",{"type":"''","value":["Passion des Français"]},", emerged the enlightened modern day France.\n\nThe Paris of today was built long after the Capetian and later the Bourbon Kings of France made their mark on Paris with the ",{"type":"''","value":["Louvre"]}," and the ",{"type":"''","value":["Palais Royal"]},", both in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Paris\/1st arrondissement"],["1st"]]},". In the 19th century, Baron von Hausmann set about reconstructing the city, by adding the long straight avenues and replacing many of the then existing medieval houses, with grander and more uniform buildings.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Tour Eiffel Wikimedia Commons.jpg"],["thumb"],["210px"],["The Eiffel Tower, Paris"]]},"\n\nNew wonders arrived during ",{"type":"''","value":["La Belle Époque"]},", as the Parisian golden age of the late 19th century is known. Gustave Eiffel's famous tower, the first metro lines, most of the parks, and the streetlights (which are partly believed to have given the city its epithet \"the city of light\") all come from this period. Another source of the epithet comes from ",{"type":"''","value":["Ville Lumière"]},", a reference not only to the revolutionary electrical lighting system implemented in the streets of Paris, but also to the prominence and aura of ",{"type":"''","value":["Enlightenment"]}," the city gained in that era.\n\nThe twentieth century was hard on Paris, but thankfully not as hard as it could have been. Hitler's order to burn the city was thankfully ignored by the German General von Choltitz who was quite possibly convinced by a Swedish diplomat that it would be better to surrender and be remembered as the saviour of Paris, than to be remembered as its destroyer. Following the war, the city recovered quickly at first, but slowed in the 1970s and 1980s when Paris began to experience some of the problems faced by big cities everywhere: pollution, housing shortages, and occasionally failed experiments in urban renewal.\n\nDuring this time however, Paris enjoyed considerable growth as a multi-cultural city, with new immigrants from all corners of the world, especially ",{"type":"''","value":["La Francophonie"]},", including most of northern and western Africa as well as Vietnam and Laos. These immigrants brought their foods and music, both of which are of prime interest for many travellers.\n\nImmigration and multi-culturalism continues in the 21st century with a marked increase in the arrival of people from Latin America, especially ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mexico"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Colombia"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brazil"]]},".

Meanwhile Latin music from salsa to samba is all the rage (well, alongside Paris lounge electronica).\n\nThe 21st century has also seen vast improvements in the general liveability of Paris, with the mayor's office concentrating on reducing pollution and improving facilities for soft forms of transportation including a huge network of cycle paths, larger pedestrian districts and newer faster metro lines.

Unless you hire a car this is the most realistic way to head toward Paris, hence why the airport charge the price they do.

Discounts apply for young\/group travellers and online bookers. Note that if you have connecting Air France flights that land and depart from different airports, you would still generally need to fetch your luggage after landing, catch either the Air France shuttle or a taxi (readily available at all airports) to the other airport and check-in again. This altogether could take up to 2 hours, particularly if traffic is at its worst. It is also common to lose time during disembarking, as passengers often need to get off on the tarmac and get on buses which will take them to the terminal. Be sure you have sufficient time between flights to catch your connection. Check-in counters usually close 30 min before the flight departs, longer if flights are international.\n\nIf you want to take RER B to catch an early flight, make sure you ",{"type":"'''","value":["bring enough change"]},", because you can only buy tickets at the coins-only machines before the counter opens.\n\nIf you arrive to CDG Airport at night you'll need a Noctilien bus to get to the city centre.

Scheduled times for first and last trains are posted in each station on the centre sign. Generally, except for early and late hours, travellers should not worry about specific Metro train times; just get to your station and take the next train.  Trains usually come 2–3 minutes apart during rush hour and 5–10 minutes apart during other times, depending on the line.\n\nVisitors travelling to or from the airport\/train stations with heavy luggage need to keep in mind that changing metro lines might be difficult at times, especially at major metro intersections. Moving from one platform to another generally involves walking up and down multiple flights of stairs. Very few stations have elevators (only the newest line 14 is wheelchair-accessible at all stations, except when the elevators are out of order). Only the busiest ones have escalators. It might be a good idea to check out the Bus routes and timings and see if one can find a convenient bus connection.\n\nAll métro trains stop at all stations on their route. On most lines, all trains run end-to-end. Some lines have rare trains that terminate at an intermediate station; if that happens, get off the train with the rest of the crowd and board the next train on the same track or on the other side of the platform (the driver will usually make an announcement in French). Lines 7 and 13 have a fork, so if you take line 13 north of ",{"type":"''","value":["La Fourche"]}," or line 7 south of ",{"type":"''","value":["Maison Blanche"]},", make sure to board the train for the correct destination which is indicated by a lit arrow on the sign in the middle of the platform and on colour-coded binders in each carriage.\n\nThe lines are named according to the names of their terminal stations (the end of the line). If you ask the locals about directions, they will answer something like : take line number ",{"type":"''","value":["n"]}," towards \"end station 1\", change at \"station\", take the line ",{"type":"''","value":["nn"]}," towards \"end station 2\" etc. The lines are also colour-coded.\n\nIn addition, there are five commuter train lines: ",{"type":"[[","value":[["w:RER A"],["RER A"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["w:RER B"],["RER B"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["w:RER C"],["C"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["w:RER D"],["D"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["w:RER E"],["E"]]},".

Certain lines, however, are operating at or near capacity, sometimes being so full that you'll have to let one or two trains pass before being able to board.  If you can help it, avoid Métro lines 1, 4, and 13 and RER line A and B during rush hours as these are the most congested lines in the system.\n\nIn addition to RER, there are many suburban train lines (Transilien) departing from the main train stations. One line of interest is the one from Gare Montparnasse to Versailles-Chantiers, a quick way to go to Versailles castle (covered by a ticket for at least Zones 1-4). The alternative is to use RER C to Versailles Rive Gauche (this station is the closest to the castle). Do ",{"type":"''","value":["not"]}," use RER C8 to Versailles Chantiers; this will do a very long loop in the southern suburbs before reaching Versailles.\n\nFor travel outside of the Paris zone, the train arrival times are shown on a monitor hanging from the ceiling inside the RER station above the platform.  Information about the stops to be made by the next incoming train is presented on a separate board also hanging from the ceiling. It is important to check this board before boarding the train, as not all trains make stops at all stations on a given line. Four letter codes (KRIN, DIPA, TORE, etc.) are used for the RER and Transilien trains; the first letter indicates the station where the train terminates, and the other three indicate the route and stops. Each line has its own nomenclature; on the RER A and B the letter codes are intended for the RATP or the SNCF staff (the two lines' operators) and the long-term commuters. On the other lines, they are intended for all passengers.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:RER A - Gare Noisiel.JPG"],["thumb"],["Information on service OKRE (Last stop Torcy)"]]},"\nYou can look up what these codes mean on information panels in the station, but the easiest and fastest way is often to check the information screens along the platforms.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["w:RATP"],["RATP"]]}," ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ratp.fr\/en\/ratp\/c_5000\/accueil\/ (website)"]}," is responsible for most public transport including metro, buses, and about half of the RER A and B.

However, both companies take the same tickets, so the difference is of little interest for most people except in case of strikes (RATP may strike without SNCF doing so or the other way round).

This ticket is necessary to ",{"type":"''","value":["enter"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["exit"]}," the RER networks, as the RER trains travel on to the Parisian suburbs, outside the zone where a regular subway ticket can be used. Beware that travelling outside the city centre without a valid RER ticket will get you fined, and the packs of inspectors who roam the system show no mercy to tourists pleading ignorance. In particular, the airports and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Versailles"]]}," Palace are ",{"type":"''","value":["not"]}," within the city, and you'll need to purchase a more expensive RER ticket to get there (see ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Get in"],["Get in"]]},").\n\nFor the subway, a single ticket (",{"type":"''","value":["ticket t+"]},") costs €1.70 (2014); however, it is generally not advisable to buy tickets by the unit. Instead, purchase a ",{"type":"''","value":["carnet"]}," of ten tickets, which can be bought for €13.70 at any station, which will bring the price per ticket down to €1.37. Tickets named ",{"type":"''","value":["tarif réduit"]}," may be purchased for children under the age of 10 but only in a carnet of 10 for €6.85. ",{"type":"''","value":["RER + Métro"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["Bus + Tram"]}," are two separate systems, but they use the same tickets. This means you have to use a new ticket if you transfer from bus to métro or from métro to bus. Tickets do not expire, but note that they are magnetic and thus should be kept away from some metallic objects such as coins.\n\nIf you use the métro, your ticket is valid for up to 2 hours for unlimited transfers in the whole métro network and in the RER within Paris. If you transfer from the RER to the métro, make sure to go through the transfer gates and not through the exit gates, otherwise your ticket will be lost. There are two exceptions: to transfer between RER C and the métro at Javel (with métro line 10) and at Musée d'Orsay (with métro line 12 at Solférino), you need to exit and cross the street but you can reuse the same ticket.\n\nIf you use the bus or tram, the ticket is valid for unlimited bus or tram transfers for up to 90 minutes from the first validation to the last validation (you need to validate your ticket each time you step into a new vehicle).\n\nA one-day ticket, a weekly pass, and a monthly pass are also available.  The price varies according to the zones for which the ticket can be used. The cheapest 1-day ticket called ",{"type":"''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.transilien.com\/web\/site\/accueil\/guide-du-voyageur\/billets-tarifs\/billets-abonnements\/Mobilis\/lang\/en Mobilis"]}]},", is valid for zones 1-2, with a price of €6.40.

Unfortunately, this ticket is not valid for use for travel to\/from Charles de Gaulle airport. Unless you plan to make many trips in one day, the ",{"type":"''","value":["carnet"]}," of ten tickets (for €1.33 per trip) will still be a much better cost than a one-day ticket. However, consider the price for all members of your group\/family, including children, which days you are travelling on, and in which zones you will be travelling.\n\nFor travellers under the age of 26, there is a special ticket (",{"type":"''","value":["Jeunes 26"]},") that you can purchase for use on the weekends or holidays. The price varies depending on the number of zones you wish to cover (Zones 1-3 is €3.55 and Zones 1-5 is €7.10; there are other zone combinations available too) and the ticket is good for one day of unlimited usage of the metro, RER, bus, and trams.\n\nIf you are staying a bit longer, the weekly and monthly passes are called ",{"type":"''","value":["Navigo Découverte"]}," (1 week pass, €19.15 for zones 1-2) and the monthly ",{"type":"''","value":["Navigo Mensuel"]}," (one-month pass, €62.90 for zones 1-2). Note that an ",{"type":"''","value":["Découverte"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["DAY-koo-VERT"]},") starts on Mondays and a ",{"type":"''","value":["Mensuel"]}," on the first of the month. The Navigo pass is non-transferrable and requires the user to provide information on the pass after the sale. The pass is sold for €5. You must write your last name (",{"type":"''","value":["nom"]},") and your first name (",{"type":"''","value":["prénom"]},") and stick your photo on the nominative card. After, you have to refill your pass with a ",{"type":"''","value":["recharge hébdomadaire"]}," (one-week refill), or a  ",{"type":"''","value":["recharge mensuelle"]}," (one-month refill). You have to choose at least two of the contiguous \"zones\": Paris is the first zone, La Défense is in the third zone, and Versailles in the fourth. Everything related to a \"Navigo\" pass is in purple (like the target for the pass in the turnstiles). Starting in September 2012, weekend travel is free throughout the entire Ile-de-France region for passengers holding a monthly or yearly Navigo pass, despite which zones are covered during the week. (For instance a Zone 1-2 pass would be valid for travel within Zones 1-5 on the weekends.)\n\nAlthough not as good a deal for adults in most cases as the ",{"type":"''","value":["Mobilis"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["Navigo"]},", there are also one-to-five-day tourist passes, called ",{"type":"''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ratp.fr\/en\/ratp\/c_22088\/parisvisite-presentation Paris Visite"]}]},", available, which are a bargain for kids of ages 4–11, starting at €4.85 per day for travel within zones 1-3.\n\nKeep your ticket or pass with you at all times as you may be checked. You will be cited and forced to pay on the spot if you do not have a ticket. The most likely spots for being checked are just behind the turnstiles at big Métro stations or during Métro line changes (",{"type":"''","value":["correspondances"]},"). RATP agents may be present in the Métro stations even on Sunday nights.\n\nMétro stations have both ticket windows and automatic vending machines. The majority of automatic vending machines do not take notes, only coins or European credit cards with a pin-encoded chip on the front. Therefore, to use either euro bills or a non-European credit card with a magnetic stripe, it is necessary to make the purchase from the ticket window. Be advised that some ticket vending machines do not give change, so use exact change or go to the ticket window. If you look at the vending machines closely, you may find one in the group that takes euro bills and will give change; these machines can be found at major or touristy stations such as Tuileries, Gare de Lyon or La Défense-Grande Arche.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Access "]},"\nSome larger stations have secondary entrances, where there is no ticket booth. These are labelled ",{"type":"''","value":["voyageurs munis de billets"]}," (passengers with tickets).\n\nWhen entering the turnstile with a ticket or Navigo pass, it will only work once for that particular station and can only be reset if you use it at another station.

Maps are located on the platform if the station has several exits or near the exit if there is only one exit.\n\nExcept for Métro 1, 2, 4, 5 and 14, the doors will not open automatically. In such a case, there are handles or buttons located both inside and outside the train that you have to push or unlatch in order to open the door. Many locals may try to squeeze into the trains after the alarm has sounded to signal the closing of the doors. While one can occasionally pass through on lines with a driver, the automatic doors on Métro 1 and 14 will continue to close despite the presence of a limb or article of clothing.  It is strongly advised to wait for the second train than to chance being caught between the doors.\n\nStrikes are a regular occurrence on the Paris public transit system. Generally during a strike, there will be reduced or no service on certain lines but parts of the network will continue to operate; however, in some cases the entire network may shut down completely. Visit the RATP and SNCF websites for information on which routes are affected by a strike. Generally, Metro lines 1 and 14 will be running during a strike because they are operated without human drivers - if you are caught by a strike, it is best to use it whenever possible.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nSince the Métro is primarily structured around a hub-and-spoke model, there are some journeys for which it can be quite inefficient, and in these cases, it is worth seeing if a direct bus route exists, despite the complexity of the bus network. A bus ride is also interesting if you want to see more of the city. The Parisian bus system is quite tourist-friendly. It uses the same single-ride tickets and ",{"type":"''","value":["Navigo"]}," as the Métro, and electronic displays inside each bus tell riders its current position and what stops remain, eliminating a lot of confusion.\n\nThese same payment devices are also valid in the ",{"type":"''","value":["Noctilien"]},", the night bus. Night buses run regularly through the central hub at Chatelet to outlying areas of greater Paris. There is also a circle line connecting the main train stations. It pays to know one's ",{"type":"''","value":["Noctilien"]}," route ahead of time in case one misses the last Métro home.  Women travellers should probably avoid taking the Noctilien on their own to destinations outside Paris.\n\nAnother option for travelers who want to see the sights of Paris without a stop on every street corner is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Paris L'Opentour Bus"]},", an open-topped double decker bus that supplies headsets with the most up to date information on the attractions in Paris. Your ticket is good for four routes ranging in time from 1-2 h.  Get off when you want, stay as long as you need, get back on the bus and head for another site.   You can purchase tickets at the bus stop.  A one-day pass is €25 for adults and €15 for children. A two-day pass is €32 for adults or €15 for children.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Bateaux Mouches Paris 2011.jpg"],["thumb"],["A bateau mouche near the Pont Neuf"]]},"\nThere are several excellent boat services which make use of the Seine.

Riding a bike anywhere in the city is far safer for the moderately experienced cyclists than almost any town or city in the United States. The French are very cognizant of cyclists, almost to a point of reverence. A few years ago Paris wasn't the easiest place to get around by bike but that has changed dramatically in recent years.  The city government has taken a number of steps in strong support of improving the safety and efficiency of the urban cyclist as well, in establishing some separated bike lanes, but even more important a policy of allowing cyclists to share the ample bus lanes on most major boulevards. Paris also has many riversides which are perfect for cycling.  The Paris bike network now counts over 150 km of either unique or shared lanes for the cyclist.  In addition, the narrower, medieval side streets of the central arrondissements make for rather scenic and leisurely cycling, especially during off-hours of the day when traffic is lighter.  Do remember to bring a good map, since there is no grid plan to speak of and almost all of the smaller streets are one-way.\n\nNote that, while the streets of Paris are generally fairly easy on novice cyclists, there are some streets in the city that should be avoided by those who do not have sufficient urban cycling experience. Rue de Rivoli, Place de la Bastille, and Place de la Nation are particularly hairy, especially during weekdays and the Saturday evening rush, and should not be navigated by anyone not confident in their ability to cycle in heavy traffic. Avenue des Champs-Elysées, Place de l'Étoile, and voie Georges Pompidou (the lower-level express lanes along the banks of the Seine) should be avoided at all times.\n\nYou can find an excellent map of the bike network called ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.paris.fr\/portail\/viewmultimediadocument?multimediadocument-id=18436 ",{"type":"''","value":["Plan des Itinéraires cyclables"]}]},") at the information centre in the ",{"type":"''","value":["Hôtel de Ville"]},".\n\nThere are two different bike rental programs in Paris:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Vélib"],["url=http:\/\/en.velib.paris.fr\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+33 1 30 79 79 30"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=€1.70 per day"],["content=In July 2007 the municipality of Paris introduced the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Vélib"]}," program (",{"type":"''","value":["vélo Liberté"]}," or Freedom Bikes) by which it is possible to rent a bike for a very modest price. Numerous stations are to be found around the city (at major landmarks and metro stations, basically every 300 m). With a credit card with a \"puce\" smart-chip (that means that American Visa and MasterCard cards do not work, however American Express cards should work even though they don't have a chip), you can subscribe for 1 day (€1.70) or 7 days (€8) with a security deposit of €150 and then get a bike. The first 30 min are free, the following 30 min costs €1, following 30 min cost €2, etc., to avoid long rentals. Thus the game is to get to another station in 25 min and get another bicycle. This rental system has been designed to allow you to \"pick & drop\" a bike, not rent the same one all day long. Try it! If your card works in the machines it's a great way to get around! The bicycles are wonderful cruiser bikes, with a front basket to put a purse or bag. If the saddle is turned around, it most probably means the bike is out of order (it's a convention among Velib users, so do the same if you notice your Velib has problems)."]]}]},"\nIn addition to operating a number of bike rental buses, the RATP has some permanent locations, including:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Roue Libre, Les Halles"],["url="],["email="],["address=1 passage Mondétour"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Facing 120, rue Rambuteau, Métro: Les Halles"],["phone=+33 1 04 41 53 49"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Bikes can be rented for one weekend (€25), M-F (€20), a working day (€9), or one day on the weekend (€14).

There are so many scooters in Paris, and there has been scooters in Europe forever really, so when people learn to drive here they learn to drive among the scooters. The French do drive quite fast, but they respect one another and it is rare that a driver will suddenly changes lanes or swing to the other side of the road without signalling. When you're driving a scooter or motorbike in Paris you can expect to be able to \"lane-split\" between the rows of cars waiting in traffic and go straight to the front of the lights.

It is generally a very bad idea to rent a car to visit Paris. Traffic is very dense during the day, and parking is, on average, exceedingly difficult and expensive. This is especially true in areas surrounding points of touristic interest, since many of these are in areas designed long before automobiles existed. A majority of Parisian households do not own cars, and many people who move to the city find themselves selling their cars within a month or two.\n\nThat said, driving may be an option for going to some sights in the suburbs such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vaux-le-Vicomte"]]}," castle or the castle and city at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fontainebleau"]]},", or for starting to other places in France. You may prefer to rent from a location outside Paris proper.\n\nTraffic rules in Paris are basically the same as elsewhere in France, with the exception of having to yield to incoming traffic on roundabouts. However, driving in dense traffic in Paris and suburbs during commute times, can be especially strenuous. Be prepared for traffic jams, cars changing lanes at short notice, and so on. Another issue is pedestrians, who tend to fearlessly jaywalk more in Paris than in other French cities. Be prepared for pedestrians crossing the street on red, and expect similar adventurous behaviour from cyclists. Remember that even if a pedestrian or cyclist crossed on red, if you hit him, you (in fact, your insurance) will have to bear civil responsibility for the damages, and possibly prosecution for failing to control your vehicle.\n\nParis has several beltway systems. There is a series of boulevards named after Napoleonic-era generals (",{"type":"''","value":["Boulevard Masséna"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["Boulevard Ney"]},", and so forth), and collectively referred to as ",{"type":"''","value":["boulevard des maréchaux"]},".

When you do get a taxi to stop, the driver will usually roll down his window to ask you where you want to go. If the driver can't (or doesn't want to) go where you want, he might tell you that he's near the end of his work day & can't possibly get you where you want before he has to go off-duty.\n\nThere is a €6.40 minimum (2012) on all taxi rides, mandated by city law, but the meter does not show this amount, which can result in being asked to pay more than the metered amount on short rides.  In Paris taxis are required by law to charge for the trip with a meter, charging a flat rate is illegal. Frequently the taxi driver will not want to drive you all the way to the doorstep, but will prefer to let you out a block or so away if there are one or more one-way streets to contend with.  Try to look at this as a cost-savings rather than an inconvenience.  You should pay while still seated in the cab as in New York and ",{"type":"''","value":["not"]}," through the front window London style.\n\nThe driver will not let you sit in the front seat (unless there are 3 or 4 of you, which is a rare case usually expedited by more money).  Taxi-drivers come in all types, some nice, some rude, some wanting to chat, some not. Smoking in taxis is generally not allowed, however it might be that the taxi driver himself wants a cigarette in which case the rule might become flexible.\n\nMany drivers prefer that you avoid using your cellphone during the ride; if you ",{"type":"''","value":["do have"]}," to, make an apologizing gesture & sound, and do make a ",{"type":"'''","value":["short"]}," call.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["A tip is included in the fare price; If you're especially satisfied with the service, you can give something (basically 10%), but you don't ",{"type":"''","value":["have"]}," to."]},{"type":"*","value":["There is an extra charge for baggage handling."]},"\nIf for any reason you wish to file a complaint about a Paris taxi, take note of the taxi's number on the sticker on the left hand backseat window.\n\nAlso if you take a taxi to the Charles de Gaulle airport be prepared to pay €70 or more because there is often heavy traffic.

Any native French person will speak French and it helps if you can speak a bit of it. In the parts of the city that tourists frequent the most (Tour Eiffel, Le Louvre, Champs-Elysées), the shopkeepers, information booth attendants, and other workers are likely to answer you in English, even if your French is advanced. These workers tend to deal with thousands of foreign-speaking tourists, and responding in English is often faster than repeating themselves in French. This is not the case for the rest of the city.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Infobox"],["Reading up"],["Before you leave you may want to read a book like ",{"type":"''","value":["French or Foe"]}," by Polly Platt or ",{"type":"''","value":["Almost French"]}," by Sarah Turnbull — interesting, well written records from English speaking persons who live in France."]]},"\n\nFor most Parisians, English is something they had to study in school, and thus seems a bit of a chore. People helping you out in English are making an extra effort, sometimes a considerable one. Parisians younger than 40 are much more likely to be fluent in English. Immigrants, often working in service jobs, are less likely (often, still struggling to learn French.)  If it's your first time in France you will have some problems understanding what people are saying (even with prior education in French). Unlike most language education tapes, real French people often speak fast, use slang, and swallow some letters.\n\nWhen attempting to speak French, do not be offended if people ask you to repeat, or seem not to understand you, as they are not acting out of snobbery. Keep your sense of humour, and if necessary, write down phrases or place names. And remember to speak slowly and clearly. Unless you have an advanced level and can at least sort of understand French movies, you should also assume that it will be difficult for people to understand what you are saying (imagine someone speaking English to you in an indiscernible accent, it's all the same).\n\nWhen in need of directions what you should do is this:  find a younger person, or a person reading some book or magazine in English, who is obviously not in a hurry; say \"hello\" or \"",{"type":"''","value":["bonjour"]},"\" (bon-zhor); start by asking if the person speaks English, \"Parlez-vous anglais?\" (Par-LAY voo on-glay?) even if the person can read something in English, speak slowly and clearly; write down place names if necessary. Smile a lot. Also, carry a map (preferably ",{"type":"''","value":["Paris par Arrondissement"]},"); given the complexity of Paris streets it is difficult to explain how to find any particular address in any language, no matter how well you speak it. If anything, the person may have an idea as to the place you are looking for, but may not know exactly where it may be, so the map always helps.\n\nOn the other hand you will probably get the cold shoulder if you stop a random person in the métro (like, say, some middle-aged hurried person who has a train to take), fail to greet them and say \"where is place X or street Y\".\n\nNow, if you speak French, remember two ",{"type":"'''","value":["magic phrases"]}," : \"Excusez-moi de vous déranger\" [ex-kuh-zay mwuh duh voo day-rawn-ZHAY] (\"Sorry to bother you\") and \"Pourriez-vous m'aider?\" [por-EE-AY voo may-DAY] (\"Could you help me?\") especially in shops; politeness will work wonders.\n\nIt is considered polite to always say \"bonjour\" or \"bonsoir\" to employees when entering any type of shop even if you have no intention of buying anything.  Upon leaving you should say \"merci\" to thank the shopkeeper for allowing you to browse and say \"bonne journée\" (bun zhur-nay) or \"bonne soirée\" (bun swa-ray) to wish them a good day or evening.  \"Bonne nuit\" is only used when telling someone \"goodnight\" when going to bed.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Pont des Arts, Paris.jpg"],["thumb"],["750px"],["center"],["The Pont des Arts (bridge of arts) and just behind, the pont Neuf (new bridge) and the île de la Cité."]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:LouvreParis.jpg"],["thumb"],["Louvre Museum and Pyramid by I.M.

Note these are \"consecutive' days\".  The card allows you to jump lengthy queues, a big plus during tourist  season when line can be extensive, and is available from participating museums, tourist offices, FNAC branches and all the main Métro and RER train stations. You will still need to pay to enter most special exhibitions. To avoid waiting in the first long queue to purchase the museum pass, stop to purchase your pass a day or more in advance after mid-day. The pass does not become active until your first museum or site visit when you write your start date.  After that, the days covered are consecutive. Do not write your start date until you are certain you will use the pass that day and be careful to use the European date style as indicated on the card: day-month-year.\n\nAlso consider the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.parispass.com\/ ",{"type":"''","value":["ParisPass"]}]},", a pre-paid entry card + queue jumping to 60 attractions including The Louvre, The Arc de Triomphe, as well as a river cruise and allows free metro & public transport travel.

These include: The Eiffel Tower, Sainte-Chapelle, the catacombs and the steps to climb to the top of the Notre Dame Cathedral.  To avoid lines, you should start your day by arriving at one of these sites at least 30 minutes before opening time.  Otherwise, expect a wait of at least an hour.  Most museums and galleries are closed on either Monday or Tuesday. Examples: The Louvre museum is closed on Tuesdays while The Orsay Museum is closed on Mondays.  Be sure to check museum closing dates to avoid disappointment!  Also, most ticket counters close 30-45 min before final closing.\n\nAll national museums are open free of charge on the first Sunday of the month. However, this may mean long lines and crowded exhibits. Keep away from Paris during Easter week due to crowding. People have to queue up at the Eiffel Tower for several hours even early in the morning.  However, this wait can be greatly reduced, if fit, by walking the first two levels, then buying an elevator ticket to the top.  Entry to the permanent exhibitions at city-run museums is free at all times (admission is charged for temporary exhibitions).\n\nThese listings are just some ",{"type":"'''","value":["highlights"]}," of things that you really should see if you can during your visit to Paris.

The restaurant trade began here just over 220 years ago and continues to thrive.  It may however come as a surprise that Paris isn't considered the culinary capital of France, rather some people prefer the French cooking found in small rural restaurants, outside of the city, closer to the farms and with their focus on freshness and regional specialities. Even among French cities, Paris has long been considered by some people as second to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lyon"]]}," for fine dining.\n\nThere have been other challenges in the last 20 years or so as restaurateurs in places like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Francisco"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sydney"]]}," briefly surpassed their Parisian fore bearers, again with an emphasis on freshness of ingredients but also borrowings from other cuisines. Parisian cooks didn't just rest on their laurels during this time, rather they travelled, taught, and studied, and together with Paris's own immigrant communities,  have revitalized the restaurant trade. Today you can find hundreds of beautiful restaurants with thoughtful (or just trendy) interior design and well-planned and executed ",{"type":"''","value":["cartes"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["menus"]}," offering a creative ",{"type":"''","value":["mélange"]}," of French and exotic foreign cuisines. It's safe to say that Paris is once again catching up with or edging ahead of its ",{"type":"''","value":["Anglophone"]}," rivals.\n\nOf course there are also some traditional offerings, and for the budget conscious there are hundreds of traditional bistros, with their sidewalk ",{"type":"''","value":["terraces"]}," offering a choice of fairly simple (usually meat centred) meals for reasonable prices.\n\nFor the uninitiated, it is unfortunately possible to have a uniformly poor dining experience during a stay in Paris, mainly because many attractions are situated in upscale areas of town, and that mass tourism attracts price gougers. It is frequent to hear of people complaining of very high Parisian prices for poor food and poor service, because they always tried to eat close to major tourist magnets. For good food and great service, try to go eat where the locals eat.\n\nMany restaurants are tiny and have tables close together - square metres are at a premium and understandably restaurateurs need to make the most of limited space. In some cases when the restaurant is crowded, you may have to sit beside strangers at the same table. If that does not appeal to you, go to a more upscale place where you will pay for the extra space.\n\nTrendy restaurants often require reservations weeks, if not months in advance. If you haven't planned far enough ahead, try to get a reservation for lunch which is generally easier and less expensive.\n\nFor an easy-to-manage eating budget while in Paris, consider: breakfast or \"petit déjeuner\" at a restaurant, possibly in your hotel, consisting of some croissants, coffee, and maybe a piece of fruit. Get a 'walking lunch' from one of Paris' many food stands—a ",{"type":"''","value":["panino"]}," in the centre of the city, a crepe from a crepe stand, a felafel pita or take-out Chinese in the Marais. ",{"type":"''","value":["Traiteurs"]}," serving Chinese food are ubiquitous in the city and good for a cheap lunch and many ",{"type":"''","value":["pâtisseries"]}," sell inexpensive coffee and sandwiches. All these are cheap (about the same as breakfast), easy, and allow you to maximize your sightseeing and walking time while enjoying delicious local or ethnic food.  For dinner, stroll the streets at dusk and consider a €20-40 prix-fixe menu. This will get you 3 or 4 courses, possibly with wine, and an unhurried, candlelit, magical European evening. If you alternate days like this with low-budget, self-guided eating (picnicking, snacking, street food) you will be satisfied without breaking the bank.\n\nIf one of the aims of your trip to Paris is to indulge in its fine dining, though, the most cost-effective way to do this is to make the main meal of your day lunch. Virtually all restaurants offer a good prix-fixe deal. By complementing this with a bakery breakfast and a light self-catered dinner, you will be able to experience the best of Parisian food and still stick to a budget.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Self catering"]},"\nBudget travellers will be very pleased with the range and quality of products on offer at the open air markets (e.g. the biggest one on Boulevard Richard Lenoir (near the Bastille), Rue Mouffetard, Place Buci, Place de la Madeleine and over the Canal Saint-Martin in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Paris\/11th arrondissement"],["11th"]]}," or in any other arrondissement).

Walk up and down Rue des Rosiers to see the variety and choices available from Israeli, Sushi, Italian and others. You will also find a wide assortment of Kosher restaurants in the 9th arrondissement of Paris near the rue Richer and rue Cadet areas. See the district guides for examples.

Most French people presume that ",{"type":"''","value":["fish"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["seafood"]}," are vegetarian dishes. This is a widely spread misunderstanding all around the country. Additionally, French people tend to confuse \"real\" vegetarians with vegans.

See the arrondissement pages for more listings. For fast food and snacks, you can always find a vegetarian sandwich or pizza. Even a kebab shop can make you something with just cheese and salad, or perhaps falafel.\n\nThere are also lots of Italian, Thai, Indian, and Mezo-American places where you will have little problem. The famous South Indian chain Saravana Bhavan have their branch near Gare Du Nord. In Rue des Rosiers (4th arrondissement) you can get delicious falafel in the many Jewish restaurants. Another place to look for falafel is on Rue Oberkampf  (11th arrondissement). Take away falafel usually goes for €5 or less.\n\nMoroccan and Algerian cooking is common in Paris - vegetarian couscous is lovely. Another good option for vegetarians - are traiteurs, particularly around Ledru Rollin (down the road from Bastille) take away food where you can combine a range of different options such as pomme dauphinoise, dolmas, salads, vegetables, nice breads and cheeses and so on.\n\nLebanese restaurants and snack shops abound as well, offering a number of vegetarian ",{"type":"''","value":["mezze"]},", or small plates.

Torn clothing and sneakers are not accepted.  The better you look, the more likely you will get past the random decisions of club bouncers. Also important to remember if male (or in a group of guys) that it will be more difficult to enter clubs; try to always have an equal male\/female ratio.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Hotels "]},"\nBeing often declared the most popular travel destination in the world, Paris has far over a thousand hotels to choose from, and even more in the surrounding ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ile-de-France"]]}," region. The choice may be overwhelming, but should be made carefully. There are huge differences in standards and location is key to make your stay in Paris enjoyable and time used well. Be prepared to pay the price for Paris' popularity - even the cheap hotels are relatively expensive.\n\nDespite the popularity with tourists, global hotel chains have relatively low penetration of the Parisian market. A notable exception is the French-based Accor, which boasts over 300 hotels in the Paris area, although with large swathes of central Paris largely uncovered. There is a fair amount of Best Westerns as well, but most international chains limit their presence to very few exclusive (and expensive) hotels in key locations. Travellers loyal to a particular brand may find their loyalty challenged, be forced to pay for it (rather than be rewarded) or unable to find their hotel brand of choice in Paris.\n\nHotels in the central arrondissements tend to be expensive, although very cheap ones can also be found. With few exceptions, they tend to offer small rooms - be aware of the fact that the difference in price between hotels can translate into difference in service, facility and appointment levels, but not necessarily room size. Rooms of 12-16 square metres (which is roughly half of standard hotels rooms e.g. in the USA) are the norm in central Paris, regardless of hotel standards.\n\nCheaper hotels in popular arrondissements tend to be older, less attractive properties, whose facilities and appointments may be very worn and outdated, far behind standards one would expect from the capital of all things pretty and fine. Even updated and restored hotels may exhibit wide variance in standards between room categories, and keep some of the rooms not refurbished or only minimally touched up to be able to offer attractive, eye-catching pricing for them and then upsell to more comfortable room categories. Always check out latest reviews, preferably with photos, to precisely determine what to expect from a given hotel and given room category.\n\nHotels outside of the city centre, or even outside of the ",{"type":"''","value":["Peripherique"]}," and Paris itself, can be far cheaper and better value for money than ones in central Paris, while still having good transit links via metro or RER. That said, you should check thoroughly how far from the metro \/ RER station the given hotel is, and whether the connection to the POIs you want to visit is direct, quick and easy. Do also factor in the added cost of transportation to outer zones, as well as the time spent to travel to and from the city and obviously resulting limitations.\n\nBecause of local preferences, a bathtub in the bathroom is a norm in most hotels, even if it means squeezing it into a very small bathroom, further limiting space. If you prefer a walk-in shower, you need to look for a hotel that specifically offers those (called \"",{"type":"''","value":["douche italienne"]},"\" by the French), and you should generally look at newer, purpose-built properties.\n\nParis hotels, almost without regard to category or price, observe high and low seasons.  These differ slightly from one hotel to another, but usually the high season roughly corresponds to late spring and summer, and possibly a couple of weeks around the Christmas season.\n\nFor individual hotel listings see the various ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Districts"],["Arrondissement"]]}," pages. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Apartment rentals "]},"\nFor those staying for a week or more, renting a furnished apartment might be a more comfortable and money-saving option, especially for 3 or more adults. Furnished apartments can differ considerably in location and quality, offer different accommodations and selections of appliances and kitchen features, or may be well-above street level with no elevator.  Expect apartment sizes to be modest.  Access to local public transport can also vary widely. So choose carefully only after getting a full description of an interesting property.\n\nMany websites will help you find rentals. Some do a more disciplined job of locating and describing properties and their locale. Most charge a commission of 10% or more; some offer insurance covering some risks.  Some may offer a few apartments for shorter stays, usually at somewhat higher cost per day.\n\nIn late-spring and summer months, desirable properties may be in short supply.  If your plans are fairly firm for those periods, you would be wise to \"reserve\" a unit well in-advance.  Owners will often ask for a non-refundable deposit of up to 50% of the total cost of your stay.  Means of payment can range from money order to PayPal or (occasionally) charge card.  (Take great care of how and with whom you share any charge card account number.)  You should send no payment to any post office box or similarly anonymous place or account...even after exchanging e-mails with a purported owner; most are no more than \"blind\" scams to take your money.\n\nThe city government has recently passed ordinances that require owners renting properties for short periods to collect a tax previously collected only by hotels. This substantial tax may not be collected by some owners, or may be demanded by them but not mentioned in their rates until you arrive.  Tax enforcement and collection remain in a state of flux.\n\nAlso note that some agencies, rental brokers or web sites, that seem amicable, attractive or claim reputations, do not abide by French law to carefully vet and select landlords and apartments they offer for rent. There are a certain number of guarantees, which are required in France before renting an apartment, and an insurance policy, which aims at protecting the tenants during their stay.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Crime"]},"\nThough Paris is a safe city, there has been a significant rise in petty crime in recent years, especially pickpocketing. It is only some of the outer suburbs of the metropolitan area (the ",{"type":"''","value":["banlieues"]},") such as Clichy-sous-Bois and Bondy which one would consider 'rough' by western standards. The most prevalent crime by far is petty theft. Pickpockets and scams, of which there are many, are the most common crime. While not common, purse snatching and muggings do happen. Violent crime is rare. Watch yourself at ATMs and other places where your cash may be visible. Keep your money in front pockets, and avoid ATMs that are open to the outside, especially at night.\n\nThe police can be reached by phone by dialing 17. Not all police officers speak English, but those found around touristy areas almost always will. They are usually friendly and perfectly approachable should you have to.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Theft in public transit "]},"\nThe metro is also a popular place for pickpockets. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hold things tightly and be aware of your surroundings."]}," While trains are usually crowded, if someone is insisting and hovers over you, they are probably going through your pockets. It is important to know that a majority of these belong to a gang. These gangs usually use young children as young as seven, with groups of them going around the metro stations pickpocketing tourists and locals alike. If there is a group of three or more suspicious looking people, be careful of your belongings.\n\nCommon tactics are two of them blocking you as you try to board the subway, with two behind you quickly going through your bag. Seconds before the doors close, the two jump off, leaving you on the metro without even realizing what has happened. Take note of what locals do. If someone warns you to be careful, there are probably some suspicious types hoping to steal from you. Also be aware that phone-snatching is the most reported crime, and avoid using your cellphone on metro platforms and in the metro itself.\n\nPickpockets are active on the rail link (RER B) from Charles de Gaulle airport to downtown Paris, which passes through the poor suburbs of Seine-Saint Denis. Try to take the trains which are nonstop between the airport and Paris proper (Gare du Nord) - EKLI\/EKIL from Paris to CDG and KRIN\/KROL from CDG to Paris. These are faster and are less crowded than the alternative.\n\nThere have also been problems with thieves physically fighting people in order to steal their belongings. The most common targets are those with suitcases and backpacks, i.e. tourists. Thieves usually coin their acts with the closing of the doors. Newer trains have cameras everywhere, and thieves are much less likely to use them. Otherwise, stow luggage on the racks above the seat and hold on to your bags so no one can grab them and then run out. You are much less likely of being a victim if the train is crowded with locals headed to work, usually at rush hour.\n\nThe train conductors are widely aware of these crimes and will usually wait a few seconds to leave the station after the doors have closed, just in case thieves have quickly jumped off with belongings. There are also emergency cords that one can pull if willing to chase after the attackers. People will usually be helpful and gladly call the police if you do not have a cell phone.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Theft in tourist hotsports "]},"\nPickpockets are most likely to be found working at crowded tourists hotspots, so keep your wallet and phone in your front pockets and hold your backpack tightly when in a crowd.\n\nA common place for phone\/camera\/wallet snatching is in tourist friendly dining areas scattered all over Paris where exposed outdoor tables are commonly right on busy sidewalks. Common practice by many western tourists is to leave an aforementioned item of value on the table (most commonly a smartphone) in front of them. Some of the criminals, working in groups of three to five people, approach your table and shove what appears to be a survey directly under your nose thus blocking your view of your valuable. While the gang members are yelling in a foreign language another one will slip a hand below your view and take your item of value from the table. This occurs very quickly (less than five seconds) and the perpetrators disappear around the corner just as quick as they arrived.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Scams "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:People at Montmartre \"selling\" trinkets.JPG"],["right"],["thumb"],["The men who will try to tie strings on your fingers"]]},"\nAt Sacré Coeur, there are many men who will try to tie strings on your finger. Not only will they demand an obscene fee for the cheap trinkets, usually over 15 euros, they will also try to pickpocket you or threaten you with force if you do not give them money. They are usually only at the base of the monument and can be avoided by taking the Funicular of Montmartre. Otherwise, you can quickly walk past them and ignore them, though they will willingly grab peoples arms. Yelling at them may cause unwanted attention and cause them to back off, but be careful. Sacré Coeur appears to be the only area where they congregate.\n\nBesides them, you will notice many people walking around with cheap trinkets at touristic areas, especially the Trocadero, Eiffel Tower, and Louvre Museum. They are generally not rude but bear in mind that buying things from them is illegal and hurts small businesses. This of course causes them to bolt at the sight of the police, and you may end up in the middle of a stampede!\n\nBe extremely careful around Barbes Rochechouart and the bars near Moulin Rouge. A very common trick is played here which might cost you up to 500 euros. The agents standing outside will force you to enter a bar and just have a look for 5 minutes. The moment you order a drink (about 5 euros), a girl will approach you and start talking generally, and leave in 10–15 minutes. After a harmless conversation with the girls when you request for a bill, you will encounter a charge of say 200-500 euros as 'service fees' for the services rendered by the girl! In case you resist to pay, the bouncers will start intimidating you try to extract money from your wallet. In such cases, threaten them that you are calling the cops (",{"type":"''","value":["flics"]},") and informing the local embassy. Try to buy some time and start creating a ruckus. However, do not try to start a fight with the bouncers.\n\nOne scam involves a \"helpful\" local buying a ticket for you. Normally, tourists buy 1-day, 3-day or longer Paris Visite passes. They would tell you that your single trip ticket has expired and bring you to the ticketing machine to purchase day passes. Then they would select the 3 day pass for adults (even though you may be a student) and deliberately show you the price on the screen. Everything else is in French so you would not understand a thing. They would proceed to purchase with a credit card and while entering the PIN code, get you to turn your back on them. They then sneakily change the ticket to a single trip ticket and ask for payment for a 3-day ticket from you. Unsuspecting tourists would pay the full sum thinking it is a 1-day or 3-day pass when it is only a useless ticket. Buy the tickets yourself to avoid situations like these, as machines are available in English and other languages. If you feel threatened, call the police and don't physically handle the ticket if they forcibly purchase without your agreement.\n\nAnother common scam is found along the banks of the Seine river and involves a ring. This involves thieves \"finding\" a ring which they give to you. They then ask you if you own it. When you say no, they insist you keep it, saying it goes against their religion or they cannot wear rings. A few moments later, they ask you for money to buy something to eat, eventually following you and becoming more annoying. You can either yell at them or steer them towards an area where there are likely to be police present, at which point they will quickly run away.\n\nThe most common scam (besides pickpocketing) that has taken over Paris by storm since June 2011 involves women coming up to tourists with pledge sheets. They pretend to be deaf people collecting money for one charity or another. Once you are distracted with the petition, an accomplice pickpockets you and takes your belongings. In addition, once you sign, they point to a thing that reads \"minimum ten euro donation.\" While they may at first insist on this, shaking your head and walking away will usually make them pester someone else. Otherwise, simply waving them off and a loud no should make them give up. If they are in a large group, as is common, be careful of your belongings! This is a ploy to pickpocket you as you are surrounded by them. At this point, yelling for the police will make them disperse quickly. This is most commonly found around major tourists sites, but has also been a problem at Gare du Nord, though this has gotten much better.\n\nNever bet money on a 3 card game as you will always lose. This trick is played by con artists on some of the bridges on River Seine near the Eiffel Tower.\n\nIt is a good idea to steer clear of the suburb of Seine Saint-Denis, as this suburb is known for its gangs and poverty, though there is of little interest to a tourists anyway. Avoid walking alone at night in the eighteenth and nineteenth arrondissement as well, as these can be a little shady at night. There is a large problem with youths from the depressed suburbs causing trouble with the police. If locals are moving away, it is most likely from a confrontation. While these groups rarely target people  besides the police, be careful. Walk away from a situation that could lead to fights or worse.\n\nIn general, remember to be aware of pickpocket as they act by trying to distract you. Avoid showing off expensive phones or a lot of money in the public transportation or in open areas. Put your things in a money belt or your front pockets, but never in the back pockets. Besides scammers and thieves, Paris is a perfectly safe  city, and most travelers will not run into any trouble.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Respect"]},"\n\nIn general, Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude and arrogant. At the same time, they tend to judge people based on their own rules, mostly based on socio-economic differences. Thus, the best way to get along in Paris is to be on your best behavior, acting like someone who is \"",{"type":"''","value":["bien élevé"]},"\" (well brought up). It will make getting about considerably easier.\n\nParisians' abrupt exteriors will rapidly evaporate if you display some basic courtesies. A simple \"",{"type":"''","value":["Bonjour, Madame"]},"\" when entering a shop, for example, or \"",{"type":"''","value":["Excusez-moi"]},"\" when trying to get someone's attention, are very important; say \"",{"type":"''","value":["Pardon"]},"\" or better \"",{"type":"''","value":["je suis désolé"]},"\" if you bump into someone accidentally or make other mistakes; if you speak French or are using a phrasebook remember to always use the vous form when addressing someone you don't know, may transform the surliest shop assistant into a smiling helper or the grumpiest inhabitant to a helpful citizen. Courtesy is extremely important in France (where the worst insult is to call someone \"",{"type":"''","value":["mal élevé"]},"\", or \"badly brought up\").\n\nIf you only learn one long phrase in French a good one would be \"",{"type":"''","value":["Excusez-moi de vous déranger, monsieur\/madame, auriez-vous la gentillesse de m'aider?"]},"\" (pardon me for bothering you, sir\/madam, would you have the kindness to help me?) - this level of extreme politeness is about the closest one can come to a magic wand for unlocking Parisian hospitality. If you know some French, try it! But remember, too, that Parisians have places to go and things to do, so if they have no time and don't answer you, don't take it personally. Many Parisians, given time, will go out of their way to help, especially if you make an effort to speak their language and act polite to them.\n\nMost foreigners tend to ignore two basic rules of courtesy in tube and train transport in Paris. If the car is full, and you stand next to the door, you are expected to get down to the platform at a stop so that people inside can find their way out.  Once they have got out, you can go back. However, don't expect the same courtesy from locals and, if the train is full, get ready to get down with enough time in advance. In a corridor, when pushing a door, you are expected to hold it to the next person, so that it won't close abruptly. This rule is strictly observed in the tube, and quite commonly everywhere else.\n\nIn addition, if you are travelling to or from the airport or train station and have luggage with you, make certain that you are not blocking the aisles in the train by leaving your bags on the floor. The RER B (which links both Orly and Charles de Gaulle airports to the city) has luggage racks above the seats; it is best to use them so you do not block the path of a local who is getting off the train before the airport stop. On the Métro and especially in the RER, please don't take up extra seats with your luggage.  There are luggage racks and spaces between the seats. Also note that use of the folding seats on the Métro is not permitted during peak hours.\n\nBe aware that there are hefty fines for littering in Paris, especially with dog droppings.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\nOne helpful thing about having official and numbered districts in Paris is that you can easily tell which arrondissement an address is in by its postal code, and can easily come up with the postal code for a Paris address if you know its arrondissement.  The rule is just pre-pend 750 or 7500 to the front of the arrondissement number, with 75001 being the postal code for the 1st and 75011 being the postal code for the 11th, and so on. The 16th has two postal codes, 75016 for the portion south of Rue de Passy and 75116 to the north; all other arrondissements only have one postal code.\n\nPhone cards are available from most \"tabacs\" but make sure you know where you can use them when you buy them, as some places still sell the ",{"type":"''","value":["cartes cabines"]}," which are hard to use as ",{"type":"''","value":["cabines"]}," are rare.\n\nThe city of Paris provides ",{"type":"'''","value":["free Internet access"]}," via 400 Wi-Fi access points throughout the city, including many public parks.
