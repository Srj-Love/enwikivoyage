The airport is notoriously confusing, so allow plenty of time for transfers. Terminal 2G is a separate building from other \"Terminals 2x\" and is only reachable via navette\/bus in 10-15 min (bus leaves every 20 min) so allow extra time. The free CDGVAL shuttle train connects the terminals and car parks together \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Flights"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Ground transportation"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["Say that again, please?"],["The RER B station named \"Aeroport Charles de Gaulle 1\" is a misnomer - it actually serves Terminal 3, not Terminal 1. However, the CDGVAL train (free of charge) links Terminals 1, 2, and 3."]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nFor getting to or from Paris, the RER commuter train, line B, has stations in T3 (from where you can take the free CDGVAL shuttle train to T1) and T2. Trains to Paris leave every 7–8 minutes and stop at Gare du Nord, Châtelet-Les Halles, Saint-Michel Notre-Dame, Luxembourg, Port-Royal, Denfert-Rochereau and Cité Universitaire. As of May 2014, adult tickets cost €9.75, and for children between 4-10 the fare is €5.95 each. Tickets are valid for connecting travel to any metro station. Day tickets are valid for travel to and from the airport. The train takes around 35 minutes to Gare du Nord and 45 minutes to Denfert-Rochereau, making this the fastest way to get to the city. Tickets can be purchased either through green (sometimes blue) automated ticket vending machines (\"Billetterie Île-de-France\") or through the ticket office serviced by transport authority personnel. Engineering works near CDG Terminal-1 and Aulnay-Sois-Bois stations are conducted between 2300hrs and 0100hrs from Monday to Friday until June 2013, so you must take a coach (bus) from  Terminal 3 to the station where you can take the RER B train to Paris. The fare is included in the train ticket you purchase.\n\nThe automated ticket machines accept Euro coins of €2, €1 and 50, 20, 10, 5 cent denominations and give change...",{"type":"''","value":["Euro notes not accepted"]},". 'Chip & PIN' credit card (typical in Europe and elsewhere) payment is ok on these machines, but if from US (or in general have only a magnetic strip or 'chip & signature'), you most likely will not be able to use your card. There is one separate automated machine which changes €20, €10 and €5 notes to €2 and €1 coins. However, due to the high demand, the machines frequently runs out of coins. There are currency exchange centres, but they explicitly state notes will not be changed for coins.   Because of these limitations, purchasing tickets from the ticket office may be your only option.  Although there are many counters, the queues can be very long. On Sunday at \"lesser\" stations, don't count on its ticket office being open.  Although it is a nuisance, the fastest way to get some tickets is to take a lot of Euro coins with you. It is also possible to explain the situation to a European buying a ticket with a working credit card, and ask them to buy one for you in exchange for a paper note.\n\nTrains for Paris leave from platforms 11 and 12. Look for signs saying \"RER B\" or \"All trains go to Paris\". When using the ticket from and to the airport (as with tickets for the RER commuter trains in general) you have to use it to enter ",{"type":"'''","value":["and"]}," to exit the quay areas.  Always keep the ticket handy as the SNCF officials sometimes check for tickets, and if you are without one you may be fined €40.  This means that after you put the ticket into the entry gate and are cleared to pass, you must retrieve the ticket from the machine and keep it with you until you leave the train system including any connections.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nAlternatively, the ",{"type":"''","value":["Roissybus"]}," service (€10) connects all terminals directly to Opéra Garnier in central Paris, but it's subject to traffic jams and rush hour, so it averages 60–90 min even on a good day. You could take bus number 350 ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ratp.info\/orienter\/f_plan.php?fm=gif&loc=bus_banlieue\/300&nompdf=350&lang=ang&partenaire="]}," and 351 ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ratp.fr\/informer\/pdf\/orienter\/f_plan.php?loc=bus_banlieue\/300&nompdf=351&fm=pdf&lang=fr&partenaire=ratp"]}," to the city and it requires three tickets t+ per person (about €5.10, 3.99€ if bought by sets of 10, or €6 if the tickets are purchased on the bus), making this the cheapest option to go to and from Paris. The tickets can be purchased at newsstands, at ticket machines, or, for a higher price, inside the bus from the driver and they need to be validated with a device lying next to the driver's seat.\n\nAir France buses ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/cars.airfrance.fr"]}," offer two stops in Paris (Porte Maillot, Montparnasse) from CDG with a 50-min ride. To reach a specific address into the city, this shared shuttle service ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.airport-paris-transfer.com\/"]}," costs €19 per person ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/manstouch.com\/travel\/airport-transfers.html"]},", private transfers cost €79 ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/manstouch.com\/travel\/airport-transfers.html"]},".

There are frequent traffic jams on the motorways leading to the airport - the Air France bus normally may need 50 minutes to get to CDG, but it may take 1½ hours as well... your best bet for arriving on time with the buses is to take them very early in the morning or during times otherwise when there isn't much traffic.\n\nWhen you arrive at CDG, you should note what terminal you arrived at (2A, 2D, etc.), because when you come back to the airport to depart at the end of your trip, the RER subway train makes two stops at CDG to cover the three terminals, but there are few indications of which airlines are at which terminals. Have a close look at your air ticket to figure out which terminal you are departing from. Air France and associates leave from Terminal 2E\/F\/G, most Star Alliance airlines leave from Terminal 1 (excepted Air Canada which leaves from Terminal 2A), most charter and low-costs flights leave from Terminal 3 (easyJet leaves from Terminal 2B).  The RER B has the airlines serviced by each terminal on a not so obvious chart posted by the door of the train.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Wait"]},"\nThere are quite a few points with power outlets specifically for charging passengers' laptops\/mobiles, both down by the food court and by some of the gates.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat and Drink"]},"\nEverything at this airport is very expensive, especially food.

Second -- have your tax refund papers stamped at the tax refund counter in the main terminal area, before you check in with your airline. Showing goods is signposted as mandatory, usually only required for high priced, marquee items.\n\nTo locate the tax refund counter in the terminal, look for the signs or ask any airline employee for directions. Don't be confused by a single line splitting between currency exchange and tax refund office: choose tax refund if you prefer Euros—while currency exchange refunds only in USD or your national currency, both buy at a robbery rate (and with no rollback to the refund window after you realized the rate).\n\nThe line can take a long time, expect several minutes per customer. At either office, you can also receive refund for your spouse if you have their passport and refund forms.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Duty-free shopping:"]}," There are no shops before security check zone. When you shop in post-security check zone, it's not genuinely taxfree, as you can receive a tax refund for those purchases as well.\n\nContrary to what one may expect, there is no L'Occitane; cheese is limited to soft sorts (and there are no ripe varietes); wines starts at €11 and some popular sorts like Chinon can't be found; selection of sausages is extremely limited.\n\nThere are no mid-range clothes or shoes stores, only luxury brands.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\nPost office only exists in B and D terminals.

There are no public shower facilities in the airport.  Air France lounges have such facilities, and the departure lounges have showers. Lounge access is included for Air France business and first class travelers. The members of the Air France and cooperating frequent flyer programs may gain access with sufficient status.  There is a possibility that some lounges may grant access to travelers on their flights for a fee.  If you would consider paying for access to the lounge, inquire when checking in for your departure.  If you must have a shower and your frequent flyer status (and charm) are insufficient to gain entry to a lounge, the airport hotels generally have rooms available (in Sep 2009, the Sheraton in Terminal 2 at the train station charged €155).\n\nLeft Luggage\/Storage.
