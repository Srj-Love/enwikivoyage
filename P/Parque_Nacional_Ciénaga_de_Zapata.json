The communist propaganda billboards along the road from Australia to Playa Larga may be the best in Cuba. Support for the government is strong on the Peninsula de Zapata because it was the poorest region in Cuba before the revolution, and the first area that the communists developed, with roads, schools, and a hospital. It is also one of Fidel's favorite areas because of the 1961 victory.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\nThe Parque Nacional Ciénaga de Zapata is similar to the Everglades National Park in Florida.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nViazul ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.viazul.com\/"]}," has bus service from Havana to Playa Larga and Playa Girón, and then on to Cienfuegos and Trinidad.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nYou'll need a car to get around the national park.

Everyone likes it, especially the under-twelve-year-olds. You get to see lots of crocodiles, and hold a baby crocodile, and eat crocodile meat in the restaurant. \n\nThe other tourist attraction at the crocodile ranch is a boat ride to Guamá. This is an island in a lake, the Laguna del Tesero (Treasure Lake). Fidel Castro enjoyed vacationing on the island and commissioned the building of a Taíno native village and 32 sculptures depicting native life. A sign at the ticket office says, in English, that the Taíno village is \"the most exciting place on Earthdon't miss it!\" Guamá was pleasant and relaxing, but \"exciting\" it wasn't. The boat ride was also fairly expensive. If you're short on cash and\/or time you might want to skip Guamá.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Beaches"]},"\nPlaya Maquina, just east of Playa Larga, is a beautiful beach.

The best birdwatching guide in the national park is Orestes Martinez Garcias, a.k.a. \"El Chino.\" He's amazing. Every time he turns around he points out a new bird.\n\nWe saw the Tocororo (Cuban Trogon), which is the national bird. We saw the Bee Hummingbird , which is the world's smallest bird and is found only in the Ciénaga de Zapata.\n\nWe also saw the Cuban Pygmy Owl, Cuban Toady, Great Lizard Cuckoo, Black-Cowled Oriole, Osprey, Cuban Blackbird, Greater Antillean Grackle, Cuban Bullfinch, Striped-Headed Tanager, American Redstart, Yellow-Headed Warbler, Palm Warbler, Red-Legged Thrush, Cuban Crow, Black-Whiskered Vireo, Cuban Vireo, Loggerhead Kingbird, La Sagra's Flycatcher, Cuban Peewee, Fernandina's Flicker, West Indian Woodpecker, Cuban Green Woodpecker, Cuban Parrot, Smooth-Billed Ani, Zenaida Dove, Common Ground Dove, Grey-Haired Quail Dove, Laughing Gull, Common Moorhen, Northern Jacana, American Kestral,  Turkey Vulture, Blue-Winged Teal, Wood Stork, Cattle Egret, Green Heron, Little Blue Heron, Neotropical Cormorant, Emerald Hummingbird, Great Blue Heron, Brown Pelican, Cuban Screech Owl, and the Black and White Warbler.\n\nEl Chino's e-mail is: chino.zapata@gmail.com; telephone: 045-98-7354 or 045 98 7355; mobile 52 94185; address: Caletón (just west of Playa Larga), Cienaga de Zapata, Matanzas, CP 43000.\n\nThe best guidebook is \"Field Guide to the Birds of Cuba,\" by Orlando H.
