Known as the City of Roses, Pasadena is most famous for its New Year's Day Rose Parade and Rose Bowl Game.  The number of people in the city balloons every year after Christmas as visitors come from all over to decorate and view the floats, as well as to attend arguably the most famous college football bowl game of the year.\n\nPasadena has become the most exciting place for nightlife in the San Gabriel Valley. With bustling Old Pasadena's 200 boutiques, national retailers, restaurants and clubs in the western section, chic shopping and dining on South Lake and abundant services in the eastern area, Pasadena is really the place to be!\n\nAs the birthplace of Julia Child and home to 500 restaurants serving cuisine from around the world, Pasadena is a real find for foodies. Adding to its culinary credentials, one of only 15 Le Cordon Bleu-affiliated culinary schools in the United States resides here. In addition, the first Trader Joe’s neighborhood market opened its doors in Pasadena in 1967. That same store on Arroyo Parkway is still serving customers today.\n\nPasadena is a cultural oasis with 14 museums and 11 performing arts organizations, including the Pasadena Playhouse and Norton Simon Museum. Pasadena also boasts the world-renowned California Institute of Technology, whose alumni and faculty have garnered 32 Nobel Prizes. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, site of the Mars exploration missions, is also just a 10-minute drive north.\n\nMost visitors to Pasadena will also not want to miss the nearby Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens (located in neighboring San Marino) which features a large art collection but is more famous for its 150 acres of botanical gardens that have been used as a backdrop for many Hollywood films.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Imperial"],["janhigh = 64"],["febhigh = 66"],["marhigh = 68"],["aprhigh = 71"],["mayhigh = 75"],["junhigh = 80"],["julhigh = 87"],["aughigh = 87"],["sephigh = 86"],["octhigh = 78"],["novhigh = 73"],["dechigh = 66"],["janlow = 41"],["feblow = 42"],["marlow = 44"],["aprlow = 48"],["maylow = 50"],["junlow = 53"],["jullow = 59"],["auglow = 59"],["seplow = 57"],["octlow = 51"],["novlow = 46"],["declow = 41"],["janprecip = 4.3"],["febprecip = 4.3"],["marprecip = 3.4"],["aprprecip = 1.4"],["mayprecip = 0.5"],["junprecip = 0.1"],["julprecip = ---"],["augprecip = 0.1"],["sepprecip = 0.5"],["octprecip = 0.7"],["novprecip = 1.8"],["decprecip = 3.1"],["description = ",{"type":"{{","value":[["ForecastNOAA"],["Pasadena"],["34.14719"],["-118.14422"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Pasadena Colorado Street Bridge 2005.jpg"],["right"],["thumb"],["Colorado Street Bridge"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nThe closest and most convenient airport is the Burbank\/Bob Hope Airport in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Burbank"]]},", which is just 16 miles from Pasadena.

There are a couple of ways to get to Pasadena from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), which is 27 miles from Pasadena. A taxi from LAX will cost approximately $80. SuperShuttle and Prime Time are shared-ride vans which serve the Pasadena area from LAX. Stand under the orange \"shared ride vans\" sign in the center concrete island outside the airport. Tell a customer service representative that you need a ride to Pasadena. They are easy to identify by their blue jackets (SuperShuttle) or red jackets (Prime Time). If no representative is available, then flag down a blue van (SuperShuttle) or red van (Prime Time) with a \"Pasadena\" placard in the windshield. Approximate cost is $25 per person. Approximate time to Pasadena is 1 hour.\n\nThe cheapest method to get to Pasadena from LAX is to use the Union Station FlyAway bus and the Metro Gold Line light rail, which is available from 3:40AM to 11:56PM daily. Do not use this method if you have many bags to carry or you do not like to walk long distances. At LAX,stand under the green \"FlyAway, Buses and Long-Distance Vans\" sign in the center concrete island outside the terminal. Board a blue FlyAway bus heading to Union Station; $7 one way (a 45-minute trip). It is a large charter-style bus and is occasionally not labeled. FlyAway buses operate every half hour, 24 hours a day.\n\nOnce you arrive at Union Station, walk behind the ticket counter and proceed down the stairs. Follow the path and enter Union Station on the left. Walk to the Metro Gold Line (yellow signs), which is located at track 1 in Union Station. Inside the track 1 terminal is an automated kiosk for purchasing tickets. Buy a one-way ticket and insert $1.50. Consider a day pass if you will be traveling by Metro again in the same day (note that a day pass is economical only if you will be boarding any Metro service at least four times in one day). Proceed up the stairs to the trains. Be sure to board the northbound (Sierra Madre Villa) trains. The Gold Line stops in Pasadena at Filmore, Del Mar, Memorial Park, Lake, Allen, and Sierra Madre Villa stations. The travel time varies from 30-90 min, depending on rush-hour conditions.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nPasadena is approximately 20 minutes from Union Station in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Los Angeles\/Downtown"],["Downtown L.A."]]}," via the Metro Gold Line light rail.

Most amenities for visitors can be found in and around the hotels and shopping districts, including Old Pasadena, Playhouse District and South Lake Avenue. These areas are all located south of the 210 Freeway.  As with much of the Los Angeles area, however, there are areas that a visitor should be cautious about entering.  In large measure, Northwest Pasadena should be approached with caution, as this is the heart of Pasadena's longstanding gang-related activity.  Police and emergency services can be reached by calling 911. Pasadena also borders the 660,000-acre Angeles National Forest, a wonderful place to explore, if you are prepared.  There are many hazards in the forest, however, including rattlesnakes. Also, summer heat can reach into the triple digits, so it is *critically* important to take plenty of water with you should you plan to hike in the forest.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nDrive to the northern end of Lake Avenue for a spectacular view of the San Gabriel valley.\n\nDuring Christmas time, see amazing light displays at: 1) the Balian House at about 2000 N.
