Highway 46 leaves Highway 101 to the east in the northern area of town at the 24th Street exit and leaves Highway 101 to the west at the southern edge of town.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nDowntown Paso Robles is laid out in a grid to the west of Highway 101, which runs north\/south along the Salinas River. Streets running east\/west are numbered from south to north (e.g. First Street is the southernmost street). North\/south streets are named in no particular fashion. Spring Street, the main street, runs north\/south. The historic core of Paso Robles is centered around 12th and 13th streets near City Park.\n\nThe historic core features several locally-owned shops and restaurants. Outside of that area, the main commercial developments with chain stores are south of town at the intersection of Highway 101 and Highway 46 West, at the intersection of Niblick Road and River Road, and at the intersection of 24th Street and Highway 101.\n\nMost of the area's vineyards are strewn along Highway 46 on both sides of town. Connoisseurs differentiate the area's wines between those along Highway 46 to the west, which has a cooler and wetter coastal climate, and Highway 46 to the east, which is hotter and drier.\n\nThe large area to the east of Highway 101 along Creston and Niblick Roads is mostly residential development.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bicycle"]},"\nGetting around Paso Robles on a bicycle is easy. The downtown area, with most of the sights and restaurants, is compact. Take a ride down Vine Street and see the restored Victorian homes. During Christmas, Vine Street is ablaze with decorations on the houses and amateur theater performances in the front yards.\n\nDuring the spring and fall, you can ride to San Miguel, about seven miles up North River Road, and visit the historic Mission San Miguel Arcángel. The road meanders by the Salinas River and then crosses over to the mission in San Miguel. The mission is being restored, but as of December 2006, you can see the graveyard with old bell and the courtyard.\n\nDuring the summer, you can escape Paso heat by taking Santa Rita Creek Road over the coastal range to Morro Bay, starting at Templeton, about a 30-mile ride. This is a dirt road part of the way, and a mountain-type bike is best. Ride into Morro Bay and load up on fish and chips at the bay. Paso Robles is a bike mecca for many enthusiasts throughout the year. There are many hilly and deserted roads around the area with few cars or people.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Carnegie Historic Library"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/carnegie-libraries.org\/california\/regions\/centralcoast\/pasorobles.html"],["email="],["address=800 12th Street"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Paso Robles Inn"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.pasoroblesinn.com\/"],["email="],["address=1103 Spring Street"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree=+1-800-676-1713"],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Known for its hot springs, this 115-year-old inn played host to notables like Ignace Paderewski, Jack Dempsey, President Theodore Roosevelt, Adela Rogers - St. John, Phoebe Apperson Hearst (the mother of William Randolph Hearst), actors Douglas Fairbanks, Boris Karloff, Bob Hope, and Clark Gable, and Major League Baseball teams during spring training."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Pioneer Museum"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.pasoroblespioneermuseum.org\/index.htm"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Vine Street Victorian Showcase"]},", December: See restored Victorian houses spectacularly lit up with Christmas lights and decorations ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.pasoroblesdowntown.org\/current_events.htm"]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Harris Stage Lines"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address=5995 North River Rd"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone =+1 805 237-1860"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=A horse driving, training, and entertainment ranch."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["California Mid-State Fair"]},", Late July through early August, featuring top-billed country and classic rock artists ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.midstatefair.com\/"]}]},{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Lavender Festival"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.pasoroblesdowntown.org\/paso-robles-events-lavender-festival.html"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=July"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Olive Festival"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.pasoroblesolivefestival.com\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=August"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Wine Festival"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.pasoroblesdowntown.org\/current_events.htm"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=May"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Pioneer Day"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.pasoroblespioneerday.org\/index.html"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=October"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Local Calendar"]},", * ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.destinationpasorobles.com\/event-calendar\/ Paso Robles Events"]}," Calendar"]},{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Cruisin' Paso Robles Car Show"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.westcoastcruise.com\/schedule.htm"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=September"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Golf"]},": There are a few golf courses in Paso, but one of the better ones is the Links Course (also known as the Links at Vista Del Hombre) off Highway 46 East near the airport.
