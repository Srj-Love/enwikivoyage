Electronic travel authorities are increasingly being used instead. Neither a valid passport nor visa, however, guarantee entry into another country.\n\nWithin your home country a passport can also be used as identification eg, when opening a bank account.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Contents"]},"\nThe first convention on passports was when, in 1920, the League of Nations decided that all passports contain information in French, being the diplomatic language of that era. Today all passports contain information in at least English and French, as well as the official language(s) of the issuing nation (if not English or French).\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["cover page"]}," includes the word \"passport\" and the name of the issuing country in the native language(s) of the issuing country(and possibly a second language, such as English); some sort of national symbol; and special, universal symbol if it is biometric. Additionally, all EU member states have \"European Union\" (perhaps in another language) above the name of the issuing country.\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["information page"]}," of the passport records basic information about the passport: its bearer's surname, given names, photo and date and place of birth, validity period, issuing authority, place of issue and passport number, and the dates the passport was issued and will expire. Most passports also contain a written request for safe passage and assistance to the bearer in the event of an emergency.  Most passports issued in recent years have a machine-readable strip at the bottom of the page to expedite encoding at the relevant stations (see the relevant section below).\n\nIn some countries, the next pages are for ",{"type":"'''","value":["amendments"]}," where the bearer country's issuing may place travel restrictions, change conditions for travel abroad, or amend the period of validity. In addition, pages may be included which provide helpful legal and practical information for the bearer. For instance a US passport contains 6 pages regarding websites and contacts for various reasons (travel restrictions, treasury restrictions on imports, paying taxes while in a foreign country, registering your stay in a foreign country), common sense subjects (don't be a target, be mindful of security threats, ways to lose citizenship), and important information (loss, theft, destruction, alteration, or mutilation of the passport, what to do in a natural disaster or catastrophic event, etc.).\n\nMost of the passport pages are allotted for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["visa"]]},"s where visas coming from different embassies or consulates are pasted. Stamps from passport control officers of both the bearer's home country and countries visited revealing the history of entry and exit of those countries are also found on these pages.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Extra pages"]},"\nSome countries, such as the US, allow the addition of extra pages to passports. Some countries require two blank pages in your passport before you enter the country. If you are running low on blank pages, contact your nearest passport office, embassy, or consulate and they should be able to add extra pages for free or a fee depending on the issuing country.\n\nOther countries, such as Canada, can issue a special passport with 48 pages instead of the usual 24. for frequent travellers. Canada does not allow extra pages to be added later, so this is definitely worth doing if you expect to travel a lot.\n\nSome countries may issue a new passport \"cross-linked\" (or even physically bound) to the old one. The old one must have a blank page for the authority to endorse a cross-link. This is useful not only when a passport is running low on blank pages, but also in cases where the visa outlasts the passport that contains it.\n\nIt can be possible for a person to hold multiple passports from a single country at the same time, although not all countries allow this and even for those countries where it is allowed, it is something of a rarity.  Not everyone, including some immigration officials in more remote places, knows that it is both possible and legal to have 2 or more passports. If you are off the beaten tracks, it is advisable to only show the passports that are needed for that particular border, as multiple forms of the same ID can look suspicious.\n\nInstances where 2nd (or even 3rd) passports can be issued include:\n",{"type":"*","value":["If there is little or no space left for new visas, but the current passport has valid visas that are still needed.

In some cases, bearers of these passports will have different visa requirements from regular passport bearers.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Official Passport"]},"\nThis type of passport is generally issued to government employees for work-related travel. These are often treated like diplomatic passports.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Internal passport"]},"\nIn some countries (e.g. Russia) a local passport is for citizen's domestic use only; for international travel a regular (tourist) passport should be issued. An internal passport often serves to prevent the flow of persons from one region of a country to another, this is often implemented to prevent residents of a volatile region from spreading their conflict to another region.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Passport Card"]},"\nMany Americans cross the Canadian border daily and new requirements require passports to travel to all nations, including Canada and Mexico. The passport card has the same status as the passport book, but in card form for the convenience of frequent border crossing and is ",{"type":"'''","value":["only"]}," valid for land and sea travel between the United States and Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean (sea travel only).\n\nIf you live in the US states of Michigan, New York, Vermont, and Washington you can also apply for an ",{"type":"'''","value":["enhanced driver's license"]}," (EDL). From a US standpoint an EDL is functionally the same as a passport card and is routinely accepted for re-entry into the United States by land or sea. However, Canadian authorities do not regard an EDL as proof of nationality, only proof of identity, making an EDL unacceptable for entry into Canada unless presented with a birth certificate or another proof of citizenship.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Technology and security"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Passportinfo.png"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Some countries require certain security features on passports to issue ",{"type":"''","value":["on-the-spot"]}," visas (visa on arrival), biometric and machine readable passports are the most common requirements. The machine code displayed above should be on the first page of your passport."]]}," \nOver the years, the way passports are produced have changed. Passports where the front pages are handwritten still exist although they are being phased out due to security concerns.\n\nIncreasingly in the 1990s, machine-readable passports have been introduced where the personal data page is automated.  That information is also encoded into two strips at the bottom of the page.  This helps speed-up lines at most passport control stations as the officers don't need to type in most of the entries in their respective fields manually in the computers.\n\nMost nations have implemented biometric passports - containing an RFID (radio frequency identification device) chip which contains (depending on issuing country) an electronic recording of passport data, a photograph, and\/or fingerprints.  Basically, an RFID station issues a signal, and the RFID chip responds with some or all of its data.  They are highly useful for customs and immigration officials to quickly and better identify you.\n\nHowever, these chips can be read by others as well; the equipment typically has a range of about a meter and it is moderately priced, widely available and easily concealed.

Once you have a passport, almost regardless of when issued, it can often be effectively used to substantiate your identity as you apply for a new one. Usually, each application must be accompanied by one or more recent, clear, head-and-shoulders colour photos of a required size for mounting and embossing in the finished document by the passport issuing centre.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["What if I lose it while travelling?"]},"\nSome people have experienced the nightmare of losing their passport. If this happens, take a deep breath and contact your embassy or consulate immediately to begin the replacement process. It can take anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks to get a new passport in a foreign country, depending on your citizenship and your location.\n\nSome countries offer \"emergency passports\" or \"emergency travel documents\" if you can convince them that you can't wait out the normal turnaround time. These documents usually have a very short term validity, typically only being good for one journey to your home country, although some may be valid longer. They take much less time to obtain than a full-blown replacement passport, often just hours. The process can be expedited by having a copy of the original, as discussed below. A police report is useful and may even be required by your embassy\/consulate, even if there was no crime involved. Don't forget to bring a couple of passport photos.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Make Copies"]},"\nSeasoned travellers often carry multiple machine or photocopies of their passport (and other important documents, e.g., visas) when abroad.

It is advisable to give your passport to a trusted agent if you will not do this in person.\n\nSome countries require hotels to keep photocopies of your passport. If you don't trust hotel staff with your passport, e.g. if staff have to leave the hotel premises to make a copy, you can provide your own. In any case, you should never surrender your passport as a security or guarantee under any circumstances, except as required by law.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Expiry dates"]},"\nIn practical terms, ",{"type":"'''","value":["the last date when you can use a passport is well before the expiration date"]},".

They are helping to ensure that you will meet immigration requirements of the countries you'll visit. You may have to stay longer than planned, e.g., due to serious injury or illness.  Overstaying your visa or holding an expired passport could be serious.\n\nIf your passport does not have sufficient time before expiring then ",{"type":"'''","value":["you may be denied"]}," boarding or entry into a foreign country.\n\nPassports from many countries (Australia, EU nations, US) remain valid for 10 years. Others allow only five years. For some countries, such as Canada, it depends on the passport type; older passports were only good for five years but the new RFID ones are good for ten. In many countries the period of validity depends on age; even if adults get ten-year passports, children may get only five.\n\nAll passports will eventually expire, and depending on your country it can take as little as one day to four months or longer to issue a new passport.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other Restrictions"]},"\nCitizens of many countries may not have legal or constitutional rights to be issued a passport by their country of citizenship. This means the citizen may be required to surrender their passport to local authorities at certain times such as when they are subject to criminal investigation. Moreover, some passports issued by some countries may expire earlier than usual, and this may indicate that the holder is nearing the required age for military conscription.\n\nIn some cases, countries with poor or no diplomatic relations with another country may bar the bearers of the other country's passport (or merely having stamps of that other country) from seeking entry.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Israel"]},"\nIsraeli passport holders and sometimes those with just an Israeli entry\/exit stamp in their passport will face restrictions and possibly denied entry to many Arab or Muslim states.  Similarly, entry into Israel with a passport from an Arab or Muslim state (or stamps from them) can cause long delays and possibly denied entry.  Visitors to Israel can ask the immigration officials not to stamp their passport, but place a stamp on a separate piece of paper.  This procedure is at the discretion of the immigration officer. Beware, though, that if you cross overland from Egypt or Jordan to Israel, the exit stamps from those countries could also result in your being barred from some Arab or Muslim countries.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Cuba"]},"\nU.S. citizens who do not get special permission from the U.S. State Department to visit Cuba have a similar problem: For a U.S. citizen to spend money in Cuba without permission from the State Department is a punishable crime, and any visit is presumed to involve expenditures of money.

Russia itself has abolished this requirement, however some other countries in the CIS retain it.  Uzbek citizens, for example, still require the exit visa.  The exit visa is normally valid for a short period compared with the passport - 2 years for Uzbekistan.  Travelling with a passport that has an expired exit visa is not normally a problem outside the CIS.  However, a citizen of a CIS country that requires it will have problems leaving another CIS state.  For example, a citizen of Uzbekistan with an expired exit stamp who travels to Russia will only be able to leave Russia to go to Uzbekistan.\n\nThe countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saudi Arabia"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bahrain"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kuwait"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oman"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Qatar"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United Arab Emirates"]]},") require foreigners on certain classes of visas to obtain exit visas in order to leave the country.
