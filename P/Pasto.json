The city is located in the Atriz Valley, at the foot of the Galeras Volcano, which can be observed from any angle of the city.\n\nPasto is a very religious city, with beautiful temples that certainly represent the architectural wealth of the city. Some of them are very ancient and have been mixed with the modern and colonial styles simultaneously.\n\nCrafts are an important tradition in Pasto, from which the so-called Pasto varnish is the most well-known.

During these days the streets of Pasto become an urban playground where men, women, children of all ethnicities and background use black, white and colour cosmetics to paint each other as a symbol of communion and joy in their ethnic and cultural differences. Besides the \"painting each other\" game, people enthusiatically join street parades which are the main highlight of the Carnival. Parades take place on January 4th (Castaneda family arrival), 5th (Black's day) and 6th (White's day) featuring floats artcrafted by local artisans and traditional dances and bands from other villages and in some cases countries like Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia. \n\nToday the Black and White Carnival in Pasto attracts a considerable number of tourists from several parts of the world and became a \"must see highlight\" featured in the calendar of Colombian and World festivities.
