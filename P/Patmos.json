Other settlements are Grikou and Kampos.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\nThere are also many lovely small beaches and coves, some with cafes and sunbeds, some without. The monastery has a small, but wonderful museum. There is also the cave of St. John, where St. John wrote the Apocalypse.

There is also a bus service that runs between Skala and Campos\/Kampos (you will see it spelt both ways) and between Skala\/Chora\/Grikou. You will find the bus timetable stuck up on the bus stop. Worth asking if it is running today, although it is usually very punctual. Often photocopies are also left for visitors to take, to make sure they don't miss the bus! Taxis will usually charge both ways if they come out to collect you. \nPatmos is also good for walking - in cooler months, or if you can cope with the high summer temperatures (remembering it is a very hilly island).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThe churches and communities on Patmos are of the Eastern Orthodox tradition.
