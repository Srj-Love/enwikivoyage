Mostly made up of hotels, world-class restaurants, nightclubs and various tourist attractions, this is a hedonists' heaven, with numerous entertainment complexes and countless bars clustered together in and around Bangla Rd and Beach Rd. The town has a very obvious female, transgender, and male sex industry to cater to every taste, however to only view it as this is a mistake, it offers so much more, for families and couples too.\n\nMassage parlors of the erotic as well the therapeutic (nuat Thai) genre provide less alcohol\/drug infested venues for punters and wellness seekers. One can even find masseuses practicing this medical art atop bamboo mats on the beach sands (100 baht and up).\n\nPrices are higher than in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Phuket Town"]]},", but there's more budget accommodation here than at the more southerly beaches.\n\nThis may not be a good destination for the average backpacker, except in the rainy season when prices are far lower. However backpackers are not Patong's target market. It is fairly and squarely aimed at holidaymakers, and does it rather well.\n\nRooming houses (\"mansions\") a few blocks inland provide nice, clean air-con rooms and suites as cheaply as 300 baht\/day (less without air-con), or 3,000-10,000 baht\/month. However Patong has every type of accommodation imaginable, from home stays to palaces.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["2004 tsunami"]},"\nBeach Rd and its immediate surroundings were hit hard by the December 2004 tsunami.

Ignore the touts and turn right as you exit the terminal). Shared minibuses are 180 baht. Tickets can be obtained immediately outside the terminal.

See \"By bus\". Alternatively, if you know the right road, you can get off the bus after you pass the Big C shopping centre on the right (the airport bus goes to the left there, and the road to Kathu and then Patong is to the right at the same intersection), then catch a local bus to Patong there.

The route starts from the southern end of the beach, after which the bus crawls through town (via Bangla Road), stopping to pick up passengers, before finally heading off across the hills, and going via Kathu, then passing near Big C before entering the Phuket Town. \n\nIn Phuket Town, those buses are usually waiting for passengers near the local market (1-1,5 km west from the Phuket bus station), however, some huge (almost bus-sized) songthaews marked \"Phuket - Patong\" were seen near Phuket bus station too. If you're coming by public bus from other areas in Thailand (like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bangkok"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Surat Thani"]]},"), as well as if using the airport bus, you will end up in this bus station. Local motorbike taxi drivers can and will offer fares like 40 baht to the market or 250 baht straight to Phuket - just walk (there's a city map in the terminal), bargain hard, or just wait for an arriving songthaew; even if he's not going to Patong, he will drop you to the bus station for no more than 20 baht, or probably 10 if there's more than 2-3 of you.\n\nTo get to the market from where the large songthaews go, turn right into Phang Nga Rd on leaving the bus station and walk to where the road ends. Turn left then right at the roundabout immediately after. Walk along this road and you will see them several hundred metres along. Choose the one to the beach you want.\n\nThe ones returning from Patong will arrive here, but if enough persons want to go to the bus station (in our case six persons) we were charged an extra 10 baht each and were dropped off there.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By hire car or van "]},"\n\"Limousine\" usually refers to a larger sedan, such as a Toyota Camry, with leather seats, etc. They cost around 600-700 baht to go to Kata Beach.
