The population of the city is a little over 40,000 and is a mix of Malay, Thai and Chinese ethnic groups and Muslim and Buddhist religions. The majority of the population are Malay-Muslim with Thai-Buddhists and Chinese forming large minority groups. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Understand "]},"\nFor several years south Thailand has been experiencing violence linked to a complex and long-running conflict. Foreign governments frequently issue travel warnings for the region, and parts of the area can indeed be quite unsafe. Independent research into the situation is therefore an absolute necessity before heading to the region.\n\nThat said, Pattani is provides a wonderful example of how people can continue to live their lives under difficult conditions. If only because of this, Pattani would be well worth a visit. But of course seeing life under conflict is not the only reason to visit. The city has a unique and vibrant culture, and the wider region has beautiful and interesting nature spots (including the beaches of Pattani Bay, which are sadly not safe to visit at the moment). If not for the on-going violence, the entire region could be quite attractive for tourists. But the conflict is there, and so the tourists aren't. This means that you will get a lot of attention, especially if you don't look Southeast Asian. Children are likely to stare and point, adults will smile to you and even greet you on the street. It's possible to get tired of this, but take it as it is: people are simply happy to have you there. \n\nIf you stay safe from attacks, the way are most likely to notice the security situation is the heavy military and police presence. Sandbag bunkers (often \"disguised\" to look like wooden sheds) are located at sensitive points in the city, as are security cameras. Military vehicles tour the city constantly, including Hummvees. This is not likely to affect you in any significant way while you're in the city, but when travelling between towns there are checkpoints with regular intervals. It's quite possible that you will be asked for ID, so carrying your passport at all times is recommended.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" History "]},"\nPattani has its origins in the ancient Hindu Malay kingdom of Langkasuka. Later it became the center of an eponymous kingdom, the Kingdom of Pattani. This kingdom was for long a protectorate of Siam, but since 1902 the entire region has been directly ruled from Bangkok.\n\nPattani was one of the first regions in Southeast Asia to adopt Islam, starting in the 14th century. It later became a centre for Islamic scholarship, and a centre of worship for a much wider region.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Orientation "]},"\nThe Pattani River runs through the city, crossed by several bridges, finding its way into the Pattani Bay. The river itself is home to many colourful fishing boats, fishing being an important part of the economy of the city. \n\nOn the west side the most important roads are Makrut Rd and Nongjik Rd running east-west, and Charoenpradit Rd and Decha Rd which run south-north. Where Charoenpradit Rd and Nongjik Rd meet, there is a roundabout with a clock tower. On the east side Yarang Rd, Panare Rd, and Pattani Pirhom Rd all run north-south, with several streets crossing between them.\n\nThe Prince of Songkhla University is on the west side of town, by the northern section of Charoenpradit Rd. Most government buildings are found close to the west bank of the river. To the east of the river is the old commercial hub of the town, containing several markets and shopping streets. Pattani Central Mosque is also in the east part of town, by Yarang Rd. \n\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.mapofthailand.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/01\/PATTANI-CITY-MAP.jpg A map of the city"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nPattani is about 1,055 km from Bangkok.

Thai Airways provides a round-trip shuttle bus (Hat Yai-Pattani) twice daily free-of-charge for passengers who make the reservation in advance. It is also possible to first take the bus from the airport into downtown Hat Yai, find your way to Hat Yai bus station (a tuk-tuk should be able to get you there) and from there catch a minibus that will take you to the door of a hotel of your choice.

The easiest way to get around, for tourists, is to do the same. Motorcycle taxis are available around the city. Just look out for the men in green vests, either driving around trying to find somebody to pick up or waiting at specific locations. For example, you can be pretty sure to find a driver or two outside most hotels, outside the hospital, by the market and so on. You can expect a ride to cost between 10-40 baht, depending on distance.\n\nTuk-tuks of the four-wheeled variety are also common. Taking a tuk-tuk is more expensive than taking a motorcycle taxi, but also more comfortable, especially if you have luggage. \n\nPattani is not a very large city, and most distances can easily be covered by foot. Walking right across town might take about 45 minutes. Indeed, walking may be the best way to orient yourself and understand the city. However you must realize that walking is not a very common means of transportation in Pattani and the pavement is used for pretty much everything other than walking. You will be weaving your way between stalls, tables, motorcycles, and even people's pot-plants - and you will regularly have to walk on the road.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" See "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Matsayit Klang - built in the early 1960s, this traditional green-hued structure is probably south Thailand's most significant mosque"]},{"type":"*","value":[" San Jao Leng Ju Khieng Shrine"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Wat Changhai"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Wat Saikow  "]},{"type":"*","value":[" Wat Si Mahapo"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Do "]},"\n\nWhen you arrive you will find that your Thai SIM card no longer works. This is due to the ongoing security situation. The SIM must be re-activated. To do this you must fill out a simple form, which includes your passport number, and it costs 50 baht. Most phone shops around town can do this. Foreign SIM's cannot be used, but it is easy to buy a prepaid number in the phone shops.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Buy "]},"\n\nPattani is definitely not a place that tourists flock to for its shopping potential. Souvenir shops are non-existent (not surprising, seeing as there are almost no tourists to shop in them anyway), and the town has very little in the way of shops selling either local handicrafts or fashion.\n\nFor your day-to-day needs while staying there, however, you should have no problems finding what you want. All sorts of shops line pretty much every major street in Pattani. 7-Eleven is ubiquitous and can be a good place for the essentials, but it will be slightly cheaper (and more fun) to shop at the many smaller, mainly Chinese-run, convenience stores scattered around town. Fresh fruit can be found at stalls around town, with several of them on both Makrut Rd. and Nongjik Rd. \n\nThe streets immediately to the east of the river are especially good for shopping. There are several bookstores, which generally stock either or both ",{"type":"''","value":["The Nation"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["Bangkok Post"]}," but relatively little else in English. Chinese stores, many selling a wide assortment of seemingly random stuff, line a section of Pattani Phirom Rd. \n\nSeveral markets can be found around Pattani. The largest one is on Yarang Rd. on the way out of town towards ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yala"]]},".\n\nThere's a Big C on the outskirts of town to the west, on the road to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yat Hai"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Eat "]},"\n\nAs with most places in Thailand, food is very easy to find in Pattani. Although perhaps not known as a culinary destination, the region has an interesting blend of Thai and Malay cooking. \n\nSmall family-run restaurants are all over town, as are street vendors and food stalls, far too many to list here. Very few of these will have a menu in English or English-speaking staff, so it may be good to equip yourself with the names of some dishes (or at least the words for noddles or rice) in Thai or Malay\/Yawi. They will, however, probably have staff who are delighted to receive foreign guests and willing to do their best to give you what you want. One sure method is to point at pictures that can often be found on menu's, or walk to the kitchen (which will be in open view by the street) and point at some dish that has already been prepared.\n\nThe CS Pattani Hotel and My Gardens Hotel both have hotel restaurants and the one in CS Pattani is known as one of the best in the city. The area outside CS Pattani also has several small restaurants and cafés worth a look. There is a night market (head east from the southernmost bridge, close to Santisuk Hotel), where you can get local types of fast food prepared before your eyes.\n\nIn 2010, the Halal Science Center at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok published a book called ",{"type":"''","value":["Unique Melayu-Thai Foods in Southern Border Cuisine"]},". The book contains recipes of local food from the provinces of Pattani, Yala, Narathiwat, Songkhla and Satun, as well as information about the restaurants from which the recipes are gathered.
