Pattaya is mostly famous for its go-go and beer bars, but local authorities have made some efforts to provide more family-friendly attractions and activities. Although the sex industry is still going strong and sex tourism remains the key money earner for Pattaya, the resort also attracts local families and holidaymakers from around the world. If you are going to be offended by the sight of fat old men hand in hand with young Thai women, then Pattaya is probably not the place for you.\n\nEfforts by local authorities over the past few years have improved the quality of the beaches, but they are still lacklustre by Thailand's standards, and overdevelopment has long since destroyed some of the natural charms the area once had. However, the plethora of hotels and guest houses, and easy access from the capital and airport, make it a popular weekend getaway. Catering for over five million annual visitors, Pattaya is also able to offer an excellent range of eating options and a wide variety of things to do. Its population is a colourful mix of nationalities and ethnicities from near and far.\n\nPattaya occupies most of the coastline of Bang Lamung District (one of the eleven districts that comprise Chonburi Province). This article only deals with Pattaya proper, which spans the areas to the east of Naklua Beach and Pattaya Beach, plus the Buddha Hill headland (which is immediately south of Pattaya Beach). ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jomtien"]]}," is covered in a separate article, and contains Jomtien Beach and the areas east of it, including Dongtan Beach.

Driving time is normally about 30 minutes (200-250 baht per person for pre-booked services). Metered taxis cost 750 baht including motorway tolls, if purchased at hotel.\n\nIf speed and convenience don't matter, the ad hoc option is to hop on virtually any bus on Sukhumvit Rd. Going south, if it's a bus that terminates at Sattahip you'll have to swap buses or finish the journey by songthaew; if it's going further east (e.g., Rayong, Chanthaburi or Trat) it'll drop you off at the airport entrance as it goes by. Going north, wait for a bus that's going further than Sattahip and then you won't need to transfer. Alternatively, the white songthaews that travel Sukhumvit Rd between Pattaya and Sattahip charge just 20 baht.\n\nOr to buck the trend big time, go by rail (3rd class, weekdays only) between Pattaya and Sattahip. Get off just before or after the line crosses Hwy 3, and connect with the airport by songthaew or bus. The fare for the 40-50 minute train ride is just 6 baht. Departs Pattaya 10:18, arrives Sattahip 11:00; departs Sattahip 13:30, arrives Pattaya 14:21.

Fares from Suvarnabhumi Airport to Pattaya should be negotiated with the driver in advance. The \"standard rate\" is 1,500 baht and you should confirm it before leaving the taxi rank. At quiet hours you may be able to negotiate downward. Passengers will be expected to pay the two tolls en route, at 30 baht each.\n\nUnlicensed taxis may try to solicit business from you, and it is important to note that these drivers do not have proper accreditation. Similarly, solicitations to take a metered and apparently licensed taxi from the departure level is an attempt to avoid the 50 baht airport fee (or for the driver to pocket it.)\n\nIt is also possible to arrange airport pickup through most hotels, and through any number of local taxi brokers. Fees through less expensive local hotels are generally the same 1,500 baht as the standard metered taxi rate, with larger resorts and international chain hotels often charging much higher rates. Local prearranged cars will run between 1,000-1,500 baht.\n\nReturn fares from Pattaya to Suvarnabhumi Airport are 800 baht plus tolls for a returning metered taxi if arranged in advance.

The \"bus\" fare is 10 baht for trips within Pattaya, for locals and foreigners. Having the correct change is by no means essential, but does keep the potential hassle factor to a minimum. In the past, dual pricing applied (5 baht base fare, but generally only applied to locals, with a 10 baht fare for foreigners) and some drivers will short-change you on a 20 baht note if you don't act like you know what you're doing, but most will return 10 baht. Avoid asking destination when using songthaew, as many drivers will charge a lot of money (100-200 baht). If you know the direction of where you're going, it's recommended you just ride the songthaew without asking the driver. That way you will just pay 10 baht per person no matter how far you go.\n\nFlat fares only apply when operating as a bus. Beware of the driver of an otherwise empty songthaew, especially one that's parked at the roadside, who might presume (or decide on your behalf) that you want to charter him as a taxi, in which case expect a much higher fare of 100 baht or more, depending on your negotiating skills. Taxis in Pattaya do not use meters at all, and unless you can speak Thai, start at 150 baht and up.\n\nThe busiest route is the beach circuit: from the junction of Second Rd and South Pattaya Rd, north along Second Rd to the Dolphin Circle roundabout; then south along the full length of Beach Rd; then briefly east along South Pattaya Rd to complete the loop. Frequency is virtually non-stop, and even at the most unlikely hours, average waiting time is literally no more than a minute, often only a few seconds during daytime hours.\n\nRoutes sometimes vary. For example with a left turn (from Beach Rd or Second Rd) into Central Pattaya Rd; or no left turn at the Dolphin Circle roundabout (where Second Rd, Beach Rd and North Pattaya Rd meet) and going straight on to Naklua (or even a right turn towards the bus station and Sukhumvit). The only way to know the route for sure is to ask (but don't let the driver mistake your asking as a charter request). Sometimes the driver will just decide to turn down a random soi for no apparent reason, or because he's just been hired as a taxi, but you'll still be expected to pay your 10 baht if you've ridden for more than a soi or two.\n\nIt's also easy to catch songthaews along South Pattaya Rd, Central Pattaya Rd, and North Pattaya Rd. In the latter case, there's often a songthaew waiting at the Dolphin Circle roundabout (they depart from here at regular intervals, or when full, and the fare to the bus station is 10 baht) and there's also a free songthaew service to the Tesco-Lotus supermarket on North Pattaya Rd.\n\nFor Jomtien, songthaews wait at the beginning of Pratamnak Rd (the continuation of Second Rd, from the South Pattaya Rd crossroads), and charge 10 baht.\n\nFor Naklua, take a songthaew up Second Rd to the Dolphin Roundabout (10 baht). If the songthaew turns left or right at the roundabout (i.e., it's not one of the few that continue straight on to Naklua), disembark immediately and cross to the north side of the roundabout, and either walk or take a northbound songthaew (10 baht) from there.\n\nWhite coloured songthaews ply Sukhumvit Rd, going as far as Si Racha and Sattahip (20 baht).

A moto-taxi will be less expensive than a songthaew charter, but arguably less safe. Roadside moto-taxi stands are scattered throughout town, and waiting drivers usually clap their hands or sometimes call out to attract the attention of potential passengers; alternatively just flag down the next available one that cruises by, as the drivers are easily identified by their coloured vests. Some will carry two, or more, passengers although this is illegal. Foreigners can expect to pay around 30-40 baht for trips around the inner parts of town.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi "]},"\nMeter-taxis are a common sight in and around Pattaya, however none of them will accept a fare using the meter. The minimum for a foreigner is usually 150 baht - even 1 km hops.

There are also some car services and non-metered taxis that operate on an on-call basis; minibuses can also be chartered. These services are suited primarily to longer trips outside the core of the town or to another city, and can be arranged through most travel agencies and many hotels\/guesthouses.Expect to pay considerably more than the cost of a songthaew charter, probably in the order of a few hundred baht. If you are going back to Bangkok, there is the cheap possibility of catching a taxi which has just came from there (with some passengers) and has to return. Since the driver isn’t going to get a passenger as soon as he leaves Pattaya, he’ll be willing to take back a passenger for cheap which should cost you no more than 800-1200 baht.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nIf considering renting a vehicle, bear in mind that traffic in Pattaya can seem very erratic by Western standards, and that driving on the left can be confusing not only for those who have previously only ever driven on the right, but also for those unfamiliar with the common Thai practice (even the police do this) of motorcycling alongside the kerb on the \"oncoming\" side of the road, or the wrong way up one-way streets. The latter problem is especially prevalent in the Pattaya Bay area, where the majority of the roads in the main tourism zones are one-way; and the northern section of Second Road requires great care as some treat the right-hand \"bus\" lane as oncoming, while others do not.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Motorcycles, scooters and bicycles"]},"\nMotorcycle rentals are a very popular way to get around, but not the safest, especially in the case of visitors with limited previous experience of motorcycling and Eastern traffic habits, and even more so in Pattaya given the large number of motorcycle-mounted holidaymakers who seem hell-bent on a Darwin Award. Also note that a motorcyclist carrying a shoulder bag, and anything placed in the front basket of a motorcycle, makes an especially easy target for bag-snatchers. Also beware the \"No Parking\" signs; fines are typically 400-500 baht.\n\nMotorbikes can be rented without difficulty at countless locations in Pattaya, including many hotels and guesthouses, usually without having to produce a licence; however it's common for foreigners to be asked to deposit their passports as security. To avoid this, simply shop around until you find one of the many places that will accept a photocopy instead. Cash deposits are also often required, with 1,000 baht being common. Motorcycle rentals do not include insurance, and both motorcycling accidents and motorbike thefts are common. Some outlets have a third-party cover which covers you for medical attention. If motorbikes don't carry this insurance they are illegal and should not be entertained. One company offering this cover is Nittayas who operates from Soi 12 Naklua.\n\nThere are not many places where you can hire bicycles but they can be hired complete with lock, for 75 baht per day from ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.canterburytalescafe.com Canterbury Tales Cafe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Cars and jeeps"]},"\nCars can easily be rented, and are a good way to explore beyond the city limits, but they are not  such a practicable way to get around the busiest central areas as traffic can be congested, and parking spaces can be difficult to find in the evening and on weekends. However, the major supermarkets offer free parking, and low-cost parking is available at the major shopping venues such as Royal Garden Plaza, Central Festival, & Big C on Second Road.\n\nRentals without insurance start from around 800 baht\/day for small cars, and from as little as 600 baht\/day for open-top jeeps; cars with insurance start at just under 1,000 baht\/day, and come down to around 5,600 baht\/week or 18,000 baht\/month in low season. High season prices (from early November) are generally a few hundred baht more.\n\nGetting the correct type of insurance cover on any rental car in Thailand is extremely important. Commercial \"Car Rental Company\" first-class insurance provides the absolute full legal cover as opposed to limited personal or third party-only insurance cover.

Standard rooms (double bed, air-con, cable TV, refrigerator, hot shower) start from 400 baht\/night, and rates are invariably per room, not per person. Soi Buakhao has many relatively cheap guest houses and is popular with long-stay visitors, with other budget places along Soi LK Metro and Soi Honey Inn. Very few of these can be booked online, or appear on hotel booking sites. The cheaper places are often above bars or massage shops, and may therefore be noisy at night. There's generally no need to book in advance.\n\nLike all resort areas in Thailand, hotel pricing is seasonal. High season dates vary from hotel to hotel, but typically prices go up considerably during the Christmas-New Year's period (which coincides neatly with the season of best weather), and are lower between February and October\/November. In addition to higher rates during the holiday period, guests staying over Christmas and New Year's Eve will often be required to pay for compulsory \"gala dinners\" which can substantially increase the cost of the room. In recent years some hotels have started to insist that March is also covered by 'high season' prices — presumably because professional Western visitors are usually free to visit during a long Easter holiday break from work, and are happy to do so despite the worsening weather.\n\nWith the exception of large resorts or international chains such as the Hard Rock and Marriott, the lowest rates available from abroad are typically those available from the hotels directly. Except for the least expensive, many will handle reservations via email or a web form. Many will expect a deposit, especially during high season, usually by credit card or bank transfer.\n\nWhile some hotels do not allow prostitutes to accompany guests to their rooms, the majority of hotels in Pattaya are used to (and even expect) it — though some \"upmarket\" hotels may charge a \"joiner fee\" for unregistered visitors as discouragement. In most hotels, security staff will keep hold of visitors' ID cards until they leave, to help protect the client from possible theft or assault, and to deter prostitutes under 20 years of age from entering the hotel. On leaving, staff will ask the girl if she had any complaints about the client.\n\nFor visitors who simply want to sleep soundly, a box of high-grade foam earplugs is a wise investment when staying at many Pattaya hotels. Also be aware that many hotels in Pattaya allow smoking in all rooms. This is nearly universal in the budget range. With the exception of those operated under the auspices of large international chains, those hotels that have dedicated non-smoking rooms will typically only have a few of them. If you are intolerant of tobacco smoke, make sure to inquire directly with the hotels about their policies and the availability of non-smoking rooms.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Budget"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Apex Hotel"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.apexhotelpattaya.com"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Second Rd adjacent to Soi 11"],["phone=+66 38 42828; +66 38 429233"],["tollfree="],["fax=+66 38 421184"],["checkin="],["checkout="],["price="],["content=All rooms have air-con, cable TV, fridge\/mini-bar, hot shower, strongbox, and telephone.

There is a common tourist trap where tourists going for jet ski-ing are being forced to pay for equipment damages (which are not caused by the tourists) amounting up to 100K baht. Even after negotiations and intervention from the related embassies and agencies, a payment of around 10K baht is still required for the damages. Thus, you must exercise extreme caution when doing equipment loans or doing sports on vehicles provided by the shops.\n\nSwindles and pick pocketing are more commonly encountered by tourists. It is inadvisable to tell ",{"type":"''","value":["anyone"]}," that it is your first visit to Thailand, since you will then be marked down as an 'easy touch'.\n\nThe nightlife\/entertainment areas have a lot of activity and are generally very safe, however ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["pickpockets"]]}]}," are a problem, especially on Walking Street when it's crowded, despite the official Tourist Police patrolling the area at night. For this reason, a visitor should not carry a passport and\/or credit card with them, especially at night. These should be left in the safe at your hotel along with the bulk of your cash, or if they must be carried then they should be securely concealed. If you have been pick pocketed and then you actually spot the likely pickpocket departing, do not follow. You could be mistaken, and you almost certainly ",{"type":"''","value":["will"]}," be accused of being mistaken. Just put it down to experience, and leave the immediate area.\n\nNever ever 'pick a fight' in any circumstance, no matter how much you have had to drink. Never try to intervene, even verbally, in an argument between two or more Thai people.\n\nNo matter how much you are being pestered, just smile and walk on. In cash payments, disputes over the value of notes and the amount of change can be avoided by carrying smaller notes and trying to give near enough the exact amount.\n\nThe beach side of Beach Road used to be worth avoiding late at night, however the entire length of both the promenade and beach are now floodlit, and although it's still a popular haunt for \"freelance\" prostitutes, it's now much busier from dusk through until dawn and by no means a \"no-go\" area.\n\nVisitors should not visit entertainment venues that do not display a long-standing fixed sign outside, or which appear to be very poorly lit inside. Also, one or two of the hundreds of seemingly bright and established venues may actually be operating as a 'clip joint', offering free admission and then refusing to allow visitors to leave until they have settled a fake bill for non-existent drinks. Again, it is wisest to simply pay up, leave and put it down to experience.\n\nAs always, travellers should take extra care in all poorly lit or more remote areas, and very late at night. This is especially the case if one has had too much to drink.\n\nMost reputable hotels will require the presentation of ID cards by guests. Throughout Pattaya guests will not be admitted to hotel rooms if they are under the age of 20.  This is a useful way for tourists to guarantee that their new-found friend is actually the age he\/she says she is, and thus avoid possible police attention.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Drugs"]},": as in all of Thailand, the penalties for possession and\/or distribution of drugs are harsh.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Gambling"]},": is illegal in Thailand, and the local press reports Pattaya Police as having a \"zero tolerance\" policy for gambling offences.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Drinking"]},"\nThe legal minimum age for customers in drinking establishments and discos is 20. In Pattaya this is rarely enforced for foreigners, but is frequently enforced for Thais, including those accompanying foreigners. Pattaya police conduct raids to check for underage employees (especially in \"indoor\" and go-go bars) and patrons (especially in discos) from time to time, and less frequently to enforce closing times. Foreign tourists are not the targets of these raids and are usually asked to produce ID (photocopy of photo\/ID page of passport will normally suffice) and then allowed to leave, but are sometimes tested for drugs via an on-the-spot urine sample.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Internet"]},"\nInternet access is widely available in Pattaya, and speed and reliability of the connection is generally good; however, as is the case throughout Thailand, quality varies. The majority of Internet shops tend to open late and close late, but many are open 24\/7; prices range from 120 baht\/hr down to 20 baht\/hr. One baht\/min is typical for predominantly tourist-oriented shops, many of which also offer lower rates for pre-paid blocks of time. It's not difficult to find well-equipped, quiet, air-conditioned Internet cafés that charge 30 baht\/hr if you shop around a little; likewise shops that can accommodate users who want to hook up their own laptops can easily be found. Printing (black\/white) is usually 10 baht\/page (30 baht\/page for colour).\n\nMany Internet cafés and photo-processing shops have facilities for off-loading digital photos from memory cards and burning them to a CD, for which the going rate is 100 baht per CD. As always, carefully verify the integrity of the images on the CD before re-formatting the memory card, and consider having two copies burned to CD — one CD to send home by mail, the other CD to take home in your luggage as a backup.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Telephone"]},"\nThe area code for Pattaya is ",{"type":"'''","value":["038"]},". You only need to dial the 0 if you're calling from within Thailand. Overseas calls can be made from many agencies and Internet shops, as well as guest houses and hotels — most advertise a rate of 10 baht\/min (or 20 baht\/min to mobile phones).
