Outside, there is a \"funiculaire\", which will carry you and your luggage to the main area, which is higher then the station. If you arrive or depart very early or late, the 'funiculaire' will probably not be open.  There are a couple hundred stairs instead. Trains come and go from the destinations you would expect, Paris, Bordeaux, Bayonne, etc.\n\nIn addition to the local trains, Pau is a stop on the TGV (high speed train) service to Paris with stops in Bordeaux.  It takes approximately 5 hours to go from Paris to Pau on the TGV.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By plane "]},"\n\nDirect flights from:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Paris#By_plane"],["Paris"]]}," CDG and Orly with Air France"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Brussels#By_plane"],["Brussels"]]}]}," - 3 flights per week with Ryanair - flying time 1hr 50min"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["London#London_City_Airport"],["London City Airport"]]}]}," - 2 flights per week with Air France(CityJet) - flying time 2hr 5min"]},"\nIndirect flights from:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["London#London_Stansted"],["London Stansted  Airport"]]}]}," - 2 flights per week with Ryanair in winter to Biarritz.  1h 55m flying time."]},"For an airport transfer, taxi, bus or coach from Biarritz Airport to Pau use Biarritz Airport Transfers ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/biarritzairporttransfers.com\/"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Le château de Pau"]}," - the birth place of Henri IV of France. Beautiful architecture. It can only be seen on hourly guided tours which are only given in French. It is free on the first Sunday of every month.

There is a large market, typical of French towns, in a hall somewhere near the centre (sure, you can find out when you get there). In it you can buy a lot of fresh foods.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nJust opposite the main gate of the chateau there is an creperie with outside tables. It is an excellent place to soak up the sun and admire the architecture.\n\nThe brasserie 'Le Berry' on rue Gachet offers a variety of French and regional fare in gigantic portions for unbelievably low prices. The steak tartare, magret de canard, fish, and salads are especially good. Be sure to order half portions as these are generally larger than the normal-sized portions at other restaurants. This is always packed with locals so you may be forced to wait a few minutes for a table.\n\nThe restaurant 'Le Goxoki' is a basque restaurant and offers several local dishes such as 'La poule au pot'. The portions are large enough to fill a rugbyman's appetite (there are lots of rugby-based items in the restaurant).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nLe Garage is a british themed bar rather near the center of town.
