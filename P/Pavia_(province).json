The latter part, although hardly known abroad, is in fact the largest wine producing region of Lombardy and has its own typical regional wines like Bonarda, Buttafuoco, Sangue di Giuda. The province offers some important sights of which the abbey of Certosa di Pavia is the most important. The city of Pavia itself is a nice, calm, relaxing historical city, with several interesting sights (tomb of Augustine, Boethius).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Abbey of Certosa di Pavia"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Renaissance square of Vigevano"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Hills and wineries of the Oltrepò"],["url=http:\/\/www.duepadroni.it\/UK-bed-and-breakfast-italy\/UK_Environs.html"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=The Oltrepo Pavese is the largest wine producing area of Lombardy, but probably also the least known one of all Italy.
