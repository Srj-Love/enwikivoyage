The main thing to do, of course, is hang out on the beach.  Because of limited public parking, the beaches are not too crowded, and the type of sand and the shape of the beach make for a good beach experience.  Surfing at Pawleys is somewhat popular, but South Carolina is not a surfing destination, and Pawleys is not the best surfing destination in South Carolina.  However, there are good waves, and you can have a great time on a body board.  Depending on the time of year, you can also catch some fish off the beach.\n\nPawleys Creek, behind the island, also offers a lot to do.  Fishing in the creek can be decent, and if you're fishing from the shore or a dock, you do not need a fishing license.  If you do not have access to a dock, you can fish in the creek from one of the two causeway bridges, near one of the two boat landings, or at the extreme north or south ends of the island.  You can also get a small boats (skiffs) in the creek, though at low tide, the water gets pretty shallow in some spots.  Those who fish from boats usually troll for flounder.  Fish to be caught include flounder, red fish (a\/k\/a red drum, spot tail bass), speckled trout, black drum, and blue fish.  Fishing bait and tackle is available at the Pawleys Island Hardware Store at the corner of North Causeway Rd. and US Hwy. 17 or at Pawleys Island Outdoors just north of the South Causeway on Hwy 17.\n\nCrabbing is also a popular past-time in the creek, and the crabbing is almost always good.  You can get a hand line and dip net or a ring net at the aforementioned bait stores and entertain the kids with an afternoon of crabbing.  If you want to catch some serious crabs, you can leave a crab pot soaking overnight.  While there are numerous clams and oysters in the creek, it is illegal to remove shell fish from the creek.\n\nThe creek is also a popular kayaking and paddle-boarding venue, and an internet search will provide you with plenty of choices for rentals.  If you're in for a more relaxing time on the creek, a lot of folks get rafts or innertubes and just float down (or up) the creek with the tide.\n\nThere is a great deal to do off-island.  The Grand Strand (the name for the string of South Carolina beaches from North Myrtle Beach in the north to just south of Pawleys Island) has numerous (perhaps a hundred) golf courses, all types of restaurants, amusement parks, water parks and museums.  You can charter fishing trips, and the Winyah Bay near Georgetown and Hunting Beach State Park both offer great experiences for the nature lover.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["buy"],["name=Litchfield Books"],["url=http:\/\/litchfieldbooks.com\/"],["email="],["address=14427 Ocean Hwy, Litchfield Landing, Unit G, Pawleys Island, South Carolina"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Mon - Sun: 9am - 6pm"],["price="],["content=Independent Book Store"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Habanero's: Mexican"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Pastaria 811: Italian"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Hanser House: Seafood, etc."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Carolina Wings: American"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Frank's & Frank's Outback"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Island Deli and Cafe"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Landolfi's: Italian"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Bove"]},{"type":"*","value":[" High Hammock"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Louis's at Pawleys and The Fish Camp Bar"],["url=http:\/\/www.louisatpawleys.com\/"],["email="],["address=Highway 17 at the Hammock Shops"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Open Daily from 11AM till 10PM weekdays and 11PM weekends"],["price="],["content=Owned and operated by Chef Louis Osteen, this restaurant is defined by his passionate devotion to the foods of his Southern ancestry and the Lowcountry.
