[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Peabody"]}," is a city in the suburban area of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Shore (Massachusetts)"],["North Shore"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Massachusetts"]]},". \nIn the April 2009 edition of Forbes Magazine, Peabody was ranked the 14th most livable city in the United States.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nFirst known as the Northfields, \"the Farms\", and Brooksby, the area was settled about 1626 within ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Salem (Massachusetts)"],["Salem"]]},", which had itself been founded in 1626 and incorporated in 1629. In 1752, the area was set off from Salem and incorporated as part of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Danvers"]]},". It was usually referred to as \"the South Parish\", associated with the church located in the center (now Peabody Square). In 1855, the community broke away from Danvers to become the town of South Danvers, incorporated that May 18. The name was changed on April 30, 1868 to Peabody after George Peabody, a noted philanthropist. It would be incorporated as a city in 1916.\n\nBeginning as a farming community, the town's streams attracted mills which operated by water power. In particular, Peabody was a major center of New England's leather industry and tanneries remained a linchpin of the city's economy into the second half of the 20th century. The tanneries have since closed, but the city remains known locally as the Leather City or Tanner City and its high school sports teams are nicknamed the Tanners.\n\nThe loss of the tanneries was a blow to Peabody's economy, but the city has made up for the erosion of its industrial base, at least in part, through other forms of economic development. Early in the 20th Century, it joined the automobile revolution, hosting the pioneer brass era company Corwin Manufacturing Companyâ€Ž. The Northshore Mall, originally The Northshore Shopping Center, is one of the region's largest malls. It opened in 1958 and is now the city's largest taxpayer. Centennial Park, an industrial park in the center of the city, has attracted several medical and technology companies.\n\nMeanwhile, West Peabody, which was mostly farmland as recently as the 1950s, has been developed into a middle-to-upper class residential area.\n\nPeabody is the location of the Salem Country Club, a private country club with a professional golf course. In the past, the club has hosted The U.S. Senior Open in 2001 and the U.S. Women's Open in 1954 and 1984.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Interstate 95 to Route 128"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By air "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Logan International Airport in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boston"]]}," or Manchester-Boston Regional Airport ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Manchester (New Hampshire)"],["Manchester, New Hampshire"]]},"."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nBrooksby Farm, a historic farm managed by the City of Peabody, is a 275-acre (1.11 km2) working farm and conservation area that has been one of the city's most popular destinations for decades.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["buy"],["name=Northshore Mall"],["url=http:\/\/www.simon.com\/mall\/default.aspx?ID=338"],["email="],["address=218 Andover St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Route 128 Exit 25 to Route 114"],["phone = +1 978 531-3441"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Boston Marriott Peabody"],["url=http:\/\/www.marriott.com\/hotels\/travel\/bospb-boston-marriott-peabody\/"],["email="],["address=8A Centennial Drive"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Route 128 Exit 28"],["phone = +1 978 977-9700"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Hampton Inn by Hilton -
