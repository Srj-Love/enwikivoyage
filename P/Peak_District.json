Popular activities in the area include hiking, visiting country houses, climbing and potholing.\n\n\"Peak District\" is often used as shorthand for the Peak District National Park, a smaller area with defined boundaries and some special protection. The name of the district is thought to have come from an ancient tribe once resident in the area and the hills and moors of the area, although spectacular in their own way, are not classic \"mountain peaks\" as might be imagined from the name.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThe Peak District is sometimes called the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Derbyshire"]]}," Peak District, but the area also covers parts of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Greater Manchester"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Staffordshire"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cheshire"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["West Yorkshire"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South Yorkshire"]]},".\n\nThe central and most rural area of the Peaks falls within the Peak District National Park, but the boundaries are not prominent (marked by roadside signs, but no barriers) and are irrelevant to most visitors: many well-known Peak villages and towns (e.g. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Glossop"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Buxton"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hayfield"]]},") are outside the Park.

The Peak District National Park Authority provides public facilities (car parks, lavatories, visitor centres) and works to maintain the rural nature of the Park, without turning it into an open-air museum; however, most land is still owned by the traditional landlords, and (although public access is very good - see below) contains working farms and towns.\n\nThis is a region of contrasts, with wild moorland, classic walking country which encompasses every kind of activity, from a gentle stroll to the lofty challenge of the Peaks themselves. The leafy lanes and quiet villages are ideal for that feeling of getting away from it all. With towns such as Buxton, with its wonderful architecture and cultural life, along with picturesque Bakewell and the attractions of Matlock, you’ll be spoiled for choice with places to stay and things to see and do. \n\nFrom cosy farmhouses and welcoming guest houses to international hotels, you’ll find all the hospitality and comfort you need for a really memorable break. There’s plenty to see, such as breathtaking caverns where the precious Blue John stone is mined, the night-time spectacle of the Matlock Illuminations and a trip back in time at the Crich Tramway Village. \n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Landscape"]},"\nThe Peak District is not mountainous; however, many hills are steep, with a few summits sufficiently prominent to warrant the description \"peak\".  The name is a little obscure, but many sources including the National Park Authority's web site ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.peakdistrict.org"]}," refer to a local 7th-century Anglian tribe, the ",{"type":"''","value":["Peacsaetna"]}," (\"Peak Dwellers\").\n\nThe Peak District is traditionally split into two contrasting areas, essentially defined by their geology. The White Peak (Derbyshire Dales) is a limestone plateau of green fields with a rolling hills and many incised dales (areas around Ashbourne, Dovedale, Matlock, Bakewell, Longnor). The Dark Peak (or High Peak) is a series of higher, wilder and boggier gritstone plateaux (moorlands) and edges (areas north of Castleton and Hathersage).\n\nHigh Peak and Derbyshire Dales are also names of local authority districts of Derbyshire.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\nThe limestone dales of the White Peak are nationally famous for rare flora, including orchids (in flower spring and early summer) and the rare Jacob's Ladder.\n\nThe peaty gritstone moors of the Dark Peak support a more limited flora (largely heather, bilberry and sphagnum moss) and a specialist fauna. Heather moorland in the Dark Peak is maintained for the commercial shooting of Red Grouse (a subspecies of the Willow Grouse unique to the British Isles, which differs from its counterpart on the European mainland by not having a white winter plumage). Other specialist moorland bird species include Ring Ouzel, Golden Plover and Curlew. Mountain Hares were introduced to the Dark Peak in the 19th century and still remain on Bleaklow and Kinder Scout. A feral colony of Wallabies that survived for many years in the Roaches area of the Staffordshire Peak is probably now extinct, as is a remnant population of Black Grouse (though a reintroduction scheme is currently being attempted elsewhere in the Peak District).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nThe High Peak in particular can experience severe winter weather and walkers need to be suitably equipped because it is really cold.

However, the Peak District has several Mountain Rescue Teams who are called out regularly to assist people who have got into difficulties either through unforeseeable accidents or (all too often) through lack of preparation or because of wilful disregard of the dangers.  Those taking part in outdoor activities should be aware of the dangers and not exceed their abilities and experience. Cave and Mountain Rescue Teams can be contacted via the standard 999 or 112 emergency services numbers. The most dangerous areas, even on apparently benign summer days, are the peat plateaux that form the top of the highest peaks in the park, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kinder Scout"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bleaklow"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Black Hill"]]},".  The \"old\" Pennine Way route used to reach Kinder Downfall via Grindsbrook Clough and the Kinder Scout plateau, and many hikers still use this route, whether they are starting the Pennine Way or are on a day walk.  After periods of heavy rains, the peat becomes completely waterlogged and turns into a dangerous bog, not unlike quicksand.  There are no reports of hikers actually drowning in the bog, but there have been cases of lone hikers sinking too deeply to extricate themselves and dying from exposure.\n\nThe dangers are reduced significantly by following common sense:  don't cross the plateaux alone; don't assume that warm, dry weather with good visibility will last more than the next hour (you can't see the other side of the moor, so you don't know what weather is approaching); take waterproofs and spare warm clothing; let someone know your planned route, and stick to it; make sure you have a compass and know how to use it.  When mist or rain descends and distant summits disapper, the flat tops of the peat moors are very disorientating, with no close summits or other landmarks that can be matched to even a large-scale map.  Climbing in and out of the peat \"groughs\" soon destroys the best \"sense of direction\" and without a compass it is almost impossible to avoid walking in circles.\n\nThe mountain rescue teams are volunteers who put their lives on the line - they should be regarded as a last lifeline for people who have genuinely unavoidable accidents not as a \"fallback\" to compensate for ignorance, foolhardiness, lack of fitness, bad planning, poor equipment, or \"fashion\" sportswear and footwear.\n\nIf you are planning to cross the Kinder plateau for the first time, you may be slightly safer if you go on a Saturday, in the hope that there will be a string of other (possibly equally lost) hikers to follow.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["East_Midlands"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usablepark"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Peak District"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["53.35"],["-1.8333333333333"]]}]
