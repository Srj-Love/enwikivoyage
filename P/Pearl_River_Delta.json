The region is often referred to as \"the world's workshop.\" The largest product groups are clothing and electronics but the industrial base is extremely diverse and the range of products manufactured is enormous.\n\nIn 1978, a small processing workshop making handbags for export to Hong Kong opened in Dongguan. This was the first export processing business in China. From then on, as Deng Xiaoping's \"reform and opening up\" policies went into effect the Delta underwent absolutely frenzied development, partly fueled by heavy Hong Kong, Taiwanese and foreign investment. There was also significant investment and massive migration from other parts of China.\n\nDuring these decades, GDP growth in industrialized countries was generally 0 to 4% a year. China managed 8 or 9% overall national growth every year for decades. The Delta was the fastest-growing region at around 15% a year! That is, GDP doubled every five years from sometime in the 80s until 2008. Shenzhen, the showcase city of the Pearl River Delta, likes to brag it is \"the fastest growing city in the fastest growing region of the fastest growing province of the fastest growing country in the world.\"\n\nPart of the \"opening up\" was creating ",{"type":"[[","value":[["List_of_Chinese_provinces_and_regions#Development_zones"],["Special Economic Zones"]]}," (SEZs) to encourage investment.

In Shenzhen and Zhuhai, Mandarin predominates because of massive migration from other regions. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hakka"]]}," is spoken by a significant minority in the region, but most speakers of that can also handle Cantonese, Mandarin or both.\n\nEnglish is more commonly spoken here than in most regions of China, due partly to the influence of Hong Kong and partly to the extensive foreign trade connections in the region. However, it is still not all that widespread; you can expect reasonable English from staff in many hotels and tourist shops, but generally not from a taxi driver or the waitress in a local restaurant.\n\nOther foreign languages — anything from Swedish to Swahili — are sometimes heard; this is a very cosmopolitan region. However, none are widespread or generally useful for travellers. However, a few of the higher-end hotels specialise in visitors from particular countries; these can provide services in Japanese, Russian or the major West European languages.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nGuangzhou and Hong Kong both have major international ",{"type":"'''","value":["airports"]}," with  many international flights.

There are also stores with foreign groceries; the German-based Metro chain is most popular with western expatriates.\n\nIn both large and small cities, Sichuan restaurants are common and there are some Hunan places; both are seriously spicy.
