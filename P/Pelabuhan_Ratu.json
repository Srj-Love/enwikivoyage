The \"angkot\" has 3 or 4 different routes (different car colour drive different route). Since the \"angkot\" car is so small, the best seat is up in the front side by side with the driver and pay for double seat. The angkot is long enough to carry your surfing board , but you have to pay for the space occupied by your surfing equipment. You can book 1 angkot and entire seat in it with only US$1 or US$2 for one trip (Rp.10,000-Rp.20,000). But still the best way for visitors to explore the area is by rental motorbike or car.
