Some of the buildings opposite the castle are medieval, one was the town jail. \nThe walk takes at least an hour and takes you round the points of interest including the Mill Pond and the fantastic original town walls. As part of the walk you will see a terrace of 3 Georgian townhouses in Main Street; Penfro, 111, The Anchorage, 113 and Tudor House 115. 111 (Penfro) was built as the town house for a rich local landowner, John Campbell. This is the man who created the wonderful Bosherston Lily Lakes on the Stackpole Estate. This house is one of the most beautiful and authentic houses in Wales, even most of the front windows are original. In the corner stone at the front is one of the first stamp machines, which was discovered when refurbishment took place about 20 years ago.\nThe Conservation Area covers most of the original town and has many very interesting houses and buildings. Hamilton House on Main Street appears to be one, but is in fact two houses. Lady Hamilton lived in one and Nelson in the other and her husband lived across the street.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nB&Bs: Pembroke has a variety of accommodation, of which B&Bs are plentiful.
