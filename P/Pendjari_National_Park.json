The Park is also famous for its richness in birds.\n\nThe Pendjari National Park is an area of 2755 square kilometres in the far north-west of Benin. The park is part of the WAP complex (W-Arli-Pendjari) which is a vast protected area in Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger. The hills and cliffs of the Atakora range make the north-west one the most scenic areas of Benin. They provide a wonderful backdrop to the Pendjari National Park, which, in its isolation, remains one of the most interesting in West Africa.\n\nIn March 2009 it was nominated as a tentative site for UNESCO's World Heritage Site program.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Elephants Pendjari.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Pendjari is an important refuge for the African elephant in West Africa."]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Pendjari Fluss.JPG"],["thumb"],["200px"],["Pendjari River."]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Lodging"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Camping"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Backcountry"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Northern Benin"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinepark"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Pendjari National Park"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Pendjari National Park"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["11.05"],["1.516667"]]}]
