From Qimei Island you can see the famous double heart stone weir (雙心石滬) which is a large stone traditional fishing trap made in the shape of two hearts.

The main point of interest on Wangan Island is the old courtyard house village ruins that are clustered around several traditional fresh water wells and of course a few temples by the sea.  These courtyard houses are believed to be some of the oldest (possibly even the oldest) such ruins in Taiwan.  These houses are now overgrown with trees.  Hopefully someone will soon recognise their local, national and international architectural, cultural and historical significance and begin restoring them as they would then be an even better tourist attraction particularly as Tea Houses and B & Bs.  \nIt is best to rent a motorbike from nearby the Wangan Island ferry terminal which in high Summer should cost between $350NT and $400NT but of course this price is very likely to be cheaper at other times of the year when discounts are likely to be offered.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Other destinations "]},"\nAimen Village (Ai-men) is located walking distance from Magong airport.

The best way to travel around is on bikes and this should come as part of the B & B package.  However, you will need a Taiwanese licence.
