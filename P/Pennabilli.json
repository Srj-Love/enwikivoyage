Its territory is partly covered by the Regional Park of Sasso Simone and Simoncello. Despite its small size, the town has had various important people, who have enriched the city's culture. Particularly important are Matteo da Bascio (born Matteo Serafini), founder of the Frati Minori Cappuccini clerical order; Orazio Olivieri, a priest who went on a clerical mission to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lhasa"]]}," and contributed to the first Italian-to-Tibetan dictionary (which was then used as based for the first English-to-Tibetan); and Tonino Guerra, a poet who has lived in Pennabilli since 1989.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:TibetPennabilli.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["300px"],["Metallic installation holding a bell and three Tibetan manikorlos"]]},"\n\nThanks to the travel of Orazio Olivieri in the 18th century, Pennabilli is today tightly bound with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tibet"]]},". In 1994, Tenzin Gyatso, XIV Dalai Lama, visited the city to celebrate the 250th anniversary since the death of the missionary. In 2005 the Dalai Lama came again, and a metallic structure holding a bell (a reproduction of the original bell in Olivieri's mission) and three Tibetan ",{"type":"''","value":["manikorlos"]}," (rotating prayer mills) was installed on the hilltop of the city. The bell and the manikorlos (each with the Buddhist ",{"type":"''","value":["Oṃ Maṇi Padme Hūṃ"]}," printed on it) can be freely operated by visitors.\n\nTonino Guerra, during his stay, enriched the city with a number of permanent artistic installations, which were named \"I luoghi dell'anima\" (places of the soul).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nArchaeological evidences suggest that the area started to get populated during the initial Roman age. At the time of barbarian invasions, around the half of the first millennium AD, the two hills upon which the city is situated (now called \"Roccione\" and \"Rupe\") were serving as shelter for the locals, living in the proximity of the Marecchia River. This gave rise to the two communities of \"Penna\" and \"Billi\", named after their particular topology: the former comes from ",{"type":"''","value":["pinna"]}," (top, summit, pinnacle), the latter from ",{"type":"''","value":["bilia"]}," (pinnacle among the trees). Some sources suggest instead that \"Billi\" was named after \"Bel\", the Etruscan god of fire, whose former temple become during the Christian age a church dedicated to the worship of Saint Lorenz (the martyr of fire).\n\nIn 1004, a member of the powerful Carpegna family, known behind his back as \"Malatesta\" (bad head), probably because he was stubborn and hardheaded, started to build a stronghold on Roccione. This is the origin of one of the most famous and important medieval lineages in Italy, whose members later conquered Verucchio, Rimini and most of the Romagna.\n\nThe union of Penna and Billi took place in 1350, when the \"stone of peace\" was placed on the market place between the two towns. The newborn municipality was consecutively conquered by Malatesta and the Montefeltro and Medici families, ending up being absorbed by the Papal State. In 1572 the bishop's residence was transferred to Pennabilli from San Leo, and Pope Gregor XIII gave the municipality the status of \"Città\" (City). Today, Pennabilli is still the capital of the San Marino-Montefeltro diocese.\n\nUntil August 15, 2009, the commune belonged to the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Marche"]]}," (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pesaro-Urbino"]]}," province) from which it was detached, together with six other municipalities of the Alta Valmarecchia area, following a referendum held on December 17 and 18, 2006.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nThe closest airports are “Marconi” airport of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bologna"]]},", around 170 km away from Novafeltria; the \"Ridolfi\" of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Forlì"]]},", at 70 km from Novafeltria; and “Federico Fellini” International Airport of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rimini"]]},", served with 2 flights daily from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]}," Stansted by Ryanair. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nThe nearest train station is in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rimini"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Bus"]},"\nFrom ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rimini"]]},", there are buses connecting to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Novafeltria"]]},", and from there to Pennabilli.
