The city of Philadelphia houses the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall, two major national historical landmarks. The interior of the state has a number of subcultures worth exploring, including the famous Amish countryside, a religious community.\n\nPennsylvania is also home to a diverse group of people, with ethnic enclaves of black, Hispanic, and Southeast Asian populations in its major cities.\n\nPennsylvania is also diverse in that the Eastern and Southeastern parts of the state are urban and densely populated, while much of the rest of the state is rural and\/or mountainous.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nMost Pennsylvanians speak American English, although many subtle regional accents and 'dialects' do exist.

The more mountainous of these areas should be traversed with caution by visitors as they can be drastically winding, narrow, or steep (or all three!) in parts.\n\nSpeed limit signs are almost exclusively posted in miles per hour, \"mph\". Seatbelts use is mandatory, and a second ticket and fine will be issued to those who are pulled over for speeding, etc. if not worn. Pennsylvania has not yet enacted a ban on hand-held cell phone usage while driving, as some neighboring states have, although the cities of Philadelphia, Allentown, Bethlehem, Erie, Harrisburg, and Wilkes-Barre have enacted bans.\n\nAs conditions go, Pennsylvania has two seasons according to an old joke: winter and construction. In the rural majority of the state, large snowfalls render the most minor of roads impassable, but the major thoroughfares like Interstates are comparatively well plowed and salted. Still, car travel anywhere should be done with extreme care in the winter, especially by those unfamiliar with the visited area.\n\nLikewise, the jest rings true in the remainder of the year. Look out for occasional paving, line painting, or road widening projects on freeways that restrict travel to a single lane. Bridge repair or any major redesign may force detours that are typically marked clearly. Speed limits in work zones are always reduced and State Police will impose ",{"type":"''","value":["double fines"]}," for breaking them. Proceed carefully around PennDOT (state transportation department) crews, who are easily visible in fluorescent yellow attire.\n\nWild animals, most notably deer, can be a problem when driving on rural Interstates and highways.  Pennsylvania currently has an overpopulation of deer, so try to avoid them crossing the road. They are unpredictable animals and panic when scared, so stopping is usually the best option until it has cleared the road.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By thumb"]},"\n\nAlthough uncommon, hitchhiking is fairly well-received, especially in more rural areas.

Serious beer drinkers probably know Pennsylvania for its wide selection craft breweries.  Hundreds of fine ales are produced each year.  Some great labels that every visitor should try include Yards, Sly Fox, Victory, Lancaster, Troegs, Philadelphia Brewing Company, and Stoudts.\n\nPennsylvania has some of the nation's most restrictive liquor laws.  If you want to bring back a beer (especially a local beer) it is recommended that you buy it at a beer distributor.  Although they only sell 24 packs and larger (as required by law), it is much cheaper than buying beer to go from a restaurant or bar.  To provide an example of this a 6 pack of Miller Lite costs around $6 in neighboring Ohio, whereas the same 6 pack will cost at least $9 in Pennsylvania.  Bars and restaurants with carryout licenses are only allowed to sell up to 12 beers to go to any individual (although technically you can buy the beer, take it outside to your car, and return to buy another 12).  Wine and liquor are available at only state stores or wineries and they can be expensive because of high taxes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nOutside of Greater Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and the Lehigh Valley, crime is not a major problem in Pennsylvania.

Street drag racing and prostitution are also problems in the state's urban areas.\n\nAs with most locations in the United States, a major cause of injury and death in Pennsylvania comes from automobile accidents. Drivers can be down-right hostile on some of the more notorious urban freeways, such as the Schuykill  Expressway in Philadelphia (usually it's a parking lot anyway), route 22 in Allentown, the 376 in Pittsburgh and on the Interstate 95 corridor in the southeast section of the state. The roads in Pennsylvania are notoriously bad, so be careful.\n\nRoad rage can be a problem during rush hour, so if you aren't familiar with the highway system, stay out of the left hand lane.  The key to safe driving is to stay defensive, you are in unfamiliar areas and while you may feel wronged, it may be the norm.\n\nMotorcyclists are not required to wear helmets in Pennsylvania, but it is still advised.\n\nRural ",{"type":"'''","value":["mountain roads"]}," can sometimes be steep, and impassable in times of ",{"type":"'''","value":["heavy snowfall"]},". In many parts of the state, especially around Pittsburgh, steep cliffs reside next to major roads, and rock slides can occur, though rare. When traveling in the central to western part of the state, it is best to stay on main roads and highways. If you're canoeing, skiing, or doing any other outdoor activity, take necessary precautions.\n\nBe sure to stay out of ",{"type":"'''","value":["abandoned mines and quarries"]},". As this industry falls out of the state's economy, mines and quarries are left abandoned. If you explore one, you risk the dangers of unstable supports, unstable ground, rats, snakes and other animals, forgotten explosives, blasting caps, explosive methane gas, and pockets of \"blackdamp\" or air without enough oxygen to support life. \n\nExploring the woods alone can be dangerous, due to the large deer and other wild animal population.
