In the early 2000s, Pensacola Beach was notorious for being incredibly unsafe.  Now that dozens more lifeguards have been hired, and new safety measures put in place, it's one of the safest beaches in the state.  Still, following a few safety tips can keep you safe in case something goes wrong. \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Lifeguards"]}," are the best way to stay safe on the island.  Four beaches on the island are staffed with lifeguards: Casino Beach, Quietwater Beach, Park East, and Chickenbone Beach.  Lifeguards are on duty seven days a week from 9:30AM to 6PM from June through August, and are on part-time duty from mid-April to mid-October.  During part-time duty, Park East and Chickenbone Beach may not be guarded.  If an emergency happens on the beach where there are no lifeguards, ",{"type":"'''","value":["call 911"]}," for help.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Rip tides"]}," are powerful currents that occur when water trapped near the shoreline escapes back into the ocean through a break in an underwater sandbar. They can drag even powerful swimmers out to sea for a very long distance. To escape a rip tide, do not panic! If you are near a lifeguard station, you can wave your arms and shout for help. Wait until the rip tide is no longer carrying you out further from land, then swim parallel to the shoreline to escape the current. Then, you can swim back towards shore.  To avoid rip tides, don't swim between the shoreline and underwater sand bars, don't swim during low tide, and pay attention to the color-coded flags.\n\nAt all lifeguard stations, ",{"type":"'''","value":["color coded flags"]}," are flown that tell how safe the water is for swimming.

Although it's tempting to skip the sunscreen, even if you have tanned skin, it's a bad idea in Florida summer.  The white sand that draws visitors here also reflects the UV rays from the sun, and unprotected skin will burn quickly.  Bring plenty of fresh water or hydrating beverages to the beach (no, Bushwhackers don't count) and wear a high-SPF, waterproof sunscreen. If you really need a tan, try using a low-SPF sunscreen that you reapply regularly; tanning low and slow is better than a quick pan-fry that leaves you looking like a lobster.
