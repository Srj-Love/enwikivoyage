It serves as a regional hub for the primarily rural and agricultural center of the state. Peoria is a small but diverse city of approximately 115,000 people that anchors a three-county metropolitan area of nearly 400,000. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nSituated on a river bluff with excellent natural resources and easy river access, the area has been settled since prehistory, with artifacts and burial mounds showing settlement as far back as 10,000 B.C. Peoria was first settled by French explorers in 1680 and is one of the oldest continuously-occupied European settlements in what is now Illinois. Thanks to its position on the Illinois River, Peoria enjoyed comfortable growth from shipping business in the 1800s and early 1900s. Like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Muncie"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Indiana"]]},", it became known as an Average American Town, leading to the famous phrase, used by Jack Benny as a radio punchline (and the Nixon administration for political spin): ",{"type":"''","value":["\"Will it play in Peoria?\""]}," \n\nResidents may rankle at the implied lack of sophistication in the phrase; right or wrong, they take fierce pride in what their city has to offer, and they see the only differences between their city and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chicago"]]}," as being size and cost-of-living. Today, most of Peoria's economy revolves around Caterpillar, a manufacturer of construction equipment, and business conventions. Illinois high school sports tournaments are also a major draw for visitors. Famous natives include Richard Pryor, for whom a street leading from town to the airport is named, and Betty Friedan, author of The Feminine Mystique.\n\nThe Peoria Area Convention and Visitors Bureau can help groups and individuals plan an itinerary in Peoria.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Twintowers.JPG"],["thumb"],["The 29-story Peoria Twin Towers, second tallest buildings in Illinois outside of Chicago"]]}," \nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.flypia.com\/index.php Peoria International Airport"]}]}," provides daily flights to several cities, including the hubs at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chicago"]]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chicago\/Far Northwest Side"],["O'Hare"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Denver"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["St. Louis"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dallas"]]},"\/",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fort Worth"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Atlanta"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Minneapolis"]]},", and more limited flights to leisure destinations including ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Las Vegas"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Detroit"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Phoenix"]]},"\/",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mesa"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Orlando"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tampa"]]},". \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Mt.
