This is the Florida experience we remember from years ago but with a modern, upscale twist. Like its sister towns, Perdido Key boasts sugar white sands and crystal water. Although boutiques and quaint eateries dot the landscape in Perdido Key, the area feels somewhat removed, enjoying a slower pace. Boating and fishing are naturals in this relaxed community.\n\nThe unspoiled, white sands of Perdido Key enjoy a history rich in lore. Rumor has it that pirates buried treasure along the precarious shoals of Perdido Bay where it enters the Gulf. Today, people still wander the beach hoping to uncover the lost treasures. Because of its unique geography the Key is one of the most natural and beautiful areas along the Gulf Coast. Here, the waves invite laughter and surfing, diving and sport fishing. The back bays and lagoons are ideal for boating or waterskiing. No doubt you’ll believe Florida's Perdido Key brims with treasure, whether or not you find anything buried.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\nThe closest airport is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Pensacola Regional Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["PNS"]]},") ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.flypensacola.com\/"]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pensacola"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Florida State Route 292"]}," links Perdido Key with Pensacola.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Perdido Key Drive"]},", part of Florida State Route 292, is the island's main road and follows the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Good Time Tours Inc.
