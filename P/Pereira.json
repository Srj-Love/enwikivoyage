So students can be seen everywhere, either walking to classes along Avenidas Las Americas, 30 de Agosto, Circunvalar, or sitting in the myriad cafes along Avenida Santander after class while chatting with friends and watching others strolling along the avenue. So its no wonder that the city's motto is \"Pereira con Vida\".\n\nThe city has a real European, small city feel to it, like being in Switzerland or the Alps. In winter season it rains a lot (almost every day, but not for too long), but you can find very dry days on summer season. The air is always fresh, good temperature, and can be balmy depending on which part of city you're visiting.\n\nPereira is also famous for being one of only with 8 separate micro-climates in world, depending on which elevation and barrio you're in.
