The ranger will escort you there around 10AM and come to collect you at the same time next day. It is just a wooden box, so bring your own bedding, candles, food etc. The treehouse is situated at the end of a tongue of grassy land with forest on either side. As the sun sets the animals all come out to graze (not the tigers though), and in the morning they are there again as the mist lifts. In between you can kick back, admire the view, listen to the orchestra of insects and birds, and amuse yourself with the graffiti collection.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Lodging"]},"\n\nAt the Bamboo Grove (Its a accomodation provided by the Kerala Forest Division)\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Camping"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Backcountry"]},"\nBe aware that leeches are likely to attach themselves to your leg if you go an a bushwalk with one of the guides.
