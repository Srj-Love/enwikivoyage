The city was founded in 1723 by Vasily Tatishchev, who was sent by Peter I to exploit the vast amounts of ores found in the region. The city was named Molotov (Мо́лотов), after Vyacheslav Molotov, the minister of foreign affairs under Jozef Stalin.\n\n\"Cultural Revolution\" started in Perm in 2008. A lot of budget money was invested in organizing of cultural events and establishments. Many major figures, such as gallerist Marat Guelman, conductor Teodor Currentzis‎ and designer Artemy Lebedev started to work in Perm. The city is changing very fast, and now it's one of the major cultural centres of Russia.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nDuring Soviet times, Perm was a closed city to foreigners as well as to non-residents to a great extent.

The city, although spaciously built, is increasingly coping with heavy traffic, especially its vast centre.\nHowever, Perm has a well-developed bus and tram network serving the whole city including its most distant suburbs such as Gaiva and Kur'ya. \n\nPerm airport Bolshoe Savino is served by bus 42 (from the bus station) and minibus 1т (from the main railway station).
