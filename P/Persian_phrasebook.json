[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Welcome banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Persian"]}," is an ancient language of Indo-European family. You can find many grammatical similarities between Persian and the other languages of this family. However, Persian is similar more to its coeval languages like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Latin phrasebook"],["Latin"]]}," than to relatively newer languages. For instance, both Latin and Persian have a subject-object-verb (SOV) basic word order (though both also use other orders sometimes), which is uncommon among modern European languages (even the descendants of Latin). \n\nToday, Persian is mainly spoken in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Iran"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Afghanistan"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tajikistan"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Uzbekistan"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bahrain"]]},". It has official status in the first three countries but was once the official, court, or literary language of many more places ranging from Turkey through India. At this time, many Persian poets emerged from the Indian subcontinent, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Central Asia"]]}," and the regions under the control of the Ottoman Empire. It is still appreciated as a literary and prestigious language among the educated elite. Many people in Iran and neighboring countries know Persian fluently even though it's not their mother tongue. It's because Iran (formerly \"Persia\" until 1935) was historically much bigger before losing many territories, especially to its neighbor ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russia"]]},". After the 1979 revolution, many Iranians migrated to the West and as a result, there are numerous Persian-speaking communities throughout the world, particularly in the USA. Persian is the second language of Islam so in many Islamic countries you can find someone knowing Persian.\n\nThe local name of the language is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Farsi"]}," (officially, ",{"type":"''","value":["Fârsiyè Dari"]}," (Dari Persian), which means \"Official\/Court Persian\"). The word ",{"type":"''","value":["Farsi"]}," has also entered English mainly because West-migrated Iranians didn't know about the native English name of their language (i.e. ",{"type":"''","value":["Persian"]},") and began to use ",{"type":"''","value":["Farsi"]},", which still prevails although somewhat decreased. Persian has three main dialects: Iranian Persian (Farsi), Afghan Persian (Dari) and Tajik Persian (Tajik). They are all mutually intelligible. The written form is the same for Farsi and Dari, both using the Arabic alphabet; Tajik is generally written with the Cyrillc alphabet.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Note"]}," - The contents of this page are written in ",{"type":"''","value":["bookish Persian"]}," so that you can use them not only in Iran but also in Afghanistan, Tajikistan and other countries.

It's because Persian has preserved the spelling of Arabic loanwords. Each of these characters has distinguished sounds in Arabic but they are all pronounced the same in Persian.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Syllable"]},"\nPersian has the following syllable patterns (C = Consonant, V = Vowel):\n\n",{"type":"{|","value":[["class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\""],["|-"],["!Pattern !!

"]},{"type":"*","value":[" The second component of any syllable is a vowel sound."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Each syllable can only have one vowel sound.

However, a few adverbs do not follow this regularity. In addition, Persian has a number of enclitics, which simply put, are unstressed endings (English example: ",{"type":"<","value":["i",["'s"]]}," in ",{"type":"<","value":["i",["Peter's book"]]},"). Enclitics do not change the stress position of the word to which they attach. Therefore, the stress position does not shift to the last syllable e.g. ",{"type":"''","value":["pedaram"]}," (my father): ",{"type":"''","value":["pe.'"]},"dar",{"type":"'''''","value":[" + enclitic ",{"type":"''","value":["-am"]}," = ",{"type":"''","value":["pe.",{"type":"'''","value":["da"]},".ram"]}," (rather than expected ",{"type":"''","value":["pe.da.'"]},"ram"]},")\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Note"]}," - As an aid to beginners, the grave accent can be placed on the first vowel of enclitics to make them distinguishable from suffixes and final letters of words. This method is used here for the genitive enclitic (è \/ yè), indefinite enclitic (ì \/ yì) and enclitic form of \"and\" (ò).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Basic grammar"]},"\nPersian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar. Therefore, reading this grammar primer would help you learn much about Persian grammar and understand phrases better. You should also be able to memorize phrases easier.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Gender"]},"\nPersian is a gender-neutral language. Such languages don't differentiate different grammatical genders (masculine, feminine and neuter) and have identical pronouns, adjectives, etc. for all of them. For example, Persian has one word for both English \"he\" and \"she\", \"him\" and \"her\", \"his\" and \"her\".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Articles"]},"\nThere is no definite article in Persian. A bare noun indicates a definite noun (which includes common and generic nouns) e.g. ",{"type":"''","value":["mâšin dar pârking ast"]},": the car is in the garage (literally: car, in garage, is); ",{"type":"''","value":["az mâr mitarsam"]},": I'm afraid of snakes (literally: from snake fear-I)\n\nIndefiniteness is expressed with the enclitic ",{"type":"''","value":["-ì"]}," (or ",{"type":"''","value":["-yì"]}," after vowels). It is for both singular and plural nouns. English does not have an exact equivalent for the Persian's plural indefinite article. It's often translated as \"some\" or \"a few\" or is simply omitted. The indefinite enclitic is added to the end of the noun phrase: ",{"type":"''","value":["mâšinì"]}," (a car, some car), ",{"type":"''","value":["mâšinhâyì"]}," (some cars)\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Plural"]},"\nNouns are pluralized with the suffix ",{"type":"''","value":["-hâ"]},". It's the only plural suffix used in spoken Persian. In written Persian, there's another plural suffix ",{"type":"''","value":["-ân"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["-gân"]}," after the vowel ",{"type":"''","value":["e"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["-yân"]}," after other vowels) which can only be used for animates and human beings in particular. It is especially useful to restrict the meaning to human beings. For example:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"''","value":["sar"]}," means \"head\", ",{"type":"''","value":["sarhâ"]}," means \"heads\" and ",{"type":"''","value":["sarân"]}," means \"chiefs, heads, leaders\""]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"''","value":["gozašte"]}," means \"past\", ",{"type":"''","value":["gozaštehâ"]}," means \"the past (events, etc.)\" and ",{"type":"''","value":["gozaštegân"]}," means \"the people of the past\""]},"\nArabic loanwords have usually brought their irregular plural forms (technically referred to as \"broken plurals\") into Persian but they can be avoided and you can use ",{"type":"''","value":["-hâ"]}," to pluralize them. In spoken Persian, broken plurals are never used except for very few cases where the broken plural has found an extended meaning. Regarding written Persian of today, the use of broken plurals has greatly decreased and it's prevalent to pluralize words with ",{"type":"''","value":["-hâ"]},".\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Note"]}," - In Persian, nouns are not pluralized when preceded by numbers because the number itself indicates quantity e.g. ",{"type":"''","value":["yek '"]},"ketâb",{"type":"'''''","value":[" (one\/a book), ",{"type":"''","value":["do\/se\/panjâh '"]},"ketâb"]}," (two\/three\/fifty books).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Genitive case"]},"\nIn Persian, the genitive case relates two or more words to each other. The genitive case is marked with the enclitic ",{"type":"''","value":["-è"]}," (or ",{"type":"''","value":["-yè"]}," after vowels). The genitive enclitic is added to all the words that are connected to the head word and complement it. Look at the following examples:\n\n",{"type":"{|","value":[["class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\""],["|-"],["!To designate"],["!Persian"],["!English"],["!Template"],["|-"],["|rowspan=\"4\"|possession"],["|pedarè Ali"],["|the father of Ali, Ali's father"],["|father-è Ali"],["|-"],["|mâdarè man"],["|my mother"],["|mother-è I"],["|-"],["|payâmbarè Eslâm"],["|the prophet of Islam"],["|prophet-è Islam"],["|-"],["|nâmè ketâb"],["|the name of the book, book's name"],["|name-è book"],["|-"],["|rowspan=\"2\"|attribute"],["|dustè xub"],["|good friend"],["|friend-è good"],["|-"],["|Âmrikâyè jonubi"],["|South America"],["|America-yè south(ern)"],["|-"],["|rowspan=\"4\"|other relations"],["|kešvarè Irân"],["|the country of Iran"],["|country-yè Iran"],["|-"],["|sâlè 2008"],["|year 2008"],["|year-è 2008"],["|-"],["|bâlâyè miz"],["|above table"],["|top-è table"],["|-"],["|šomâlè Tehrân"],["|north of Tehran"],["|north-è Tehran"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Accusative case"]},"\nThe accusative case is indicated with the enclitic ",{"type":"''","value":["râ"]},", added to the end of the noun phrase. Despite being an enclitic, it is written apart from the host word in the Persian script. Examples: ",{"type":"''","value":["dar râ bastam"]}," (I closed the door), ",{"type":"''","value":["in filmè Hendi râ qablan dide budam"]}," (I had already seen this Indian film).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Adjective"]},"\nAdjectives have only one form. They agree neither in gender nor in number with the noun they modify. They come after the noun and are related to it with the genitive enclitic: ",{"type":"''","value":["pesarè xub"]},": good boy (template: boy-è good), ",{"type":"''","value":["doxtarhâyè xub"]},": good girls (template: girl-hâ-yè good). As stated before, the indefinite article is added to the end of the noun phrase, so: ",{"type":"''","value":["pesarè xubì"]}," (a\/some good boy), ",{"type":"''","value":["doxtarhâyè xubì"]}," ((some) good girls).\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Comparative"]},"\nThe comparative form of an adjective is always made by adding the comparative suffix ",{"type":"''","value":["-tar"]}," to the end of the adjective: bad (bad), badtar (worse); kam (little), kamtar (less); zibâ (beautiful), zibâtar (more beautiful).\n\nThe common pattern to compare A with B is: A + comparative + ",{"type":"''","value":["az"]}," (from) + B + verb\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"<","value":["nowiki",["[došmanè dânâ] [behtar] [az] [dustè nâdân] [ast]"]]},": a wise foe is better than a foolish friend (template: foe-yè wise, good-tar, from, friend-è foolish, is). It's a Persian proverb."]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["Superlative"]},"\nThe superlative form of an adjective is always made by adding the superlative suffix ",{"type":"''","value":["-in"]}," to the comparative: bad (bad), badtar (worse), badtarin (the worst). The superlative comes before the noun e.g. ",{"type":"''","value":["behtarin hotel"]}," (the best hotel), ",{"type":"''","value":["behtarin hotelè in šahr"]}," (the best hotel of this city)\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Demonstratives"]},"\nDemonstrative adjectives come before nouns and like other adjectives, they have only one form. In Persian, we don't say \"these books\" but \"this books\". The plural form itself indicates that we are pointing to a plural noun. Basic demonstrative adjectives are ",{"type":"''","value":["ân"]}," (distal: that, those) and ",{"type":"''","value":["in"]}," (proximal: this, these):\n",{"type":"*","value":[" When combined with jâ (place), they make adverbs: injâ (here) and ânjâ (there)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" When combined with chon (like), they make demonstratives: chonin (such, like this) and chonân (such, like that)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" When combined with ham (also; even), they make demonstratives: hamin (this\/the same\/one\/very) and hamân (that\/the same\/one\/very)"]},"\nA pronoun (pro-noun) substitutes a noun phrase therefore the quantity (singular or plural) must be indicated. Therefore, demonstrative pronouns agree in number with the noun phrase whose place they take: ",{"type":"''","value":["ân"]}," (that), ",{"type":"''","value":["ânhâ"]}," (those), ",{"type":"''","value":["in"]}," (this), ",{"type":"''","value":["inhâ"]}," (these). \n\nDemonstrative pronouns are also used as subjective pronouns. For example, the Persian word for \"they\" is ",{"type":"''","value":["ânhâ"]},". Distal pronouns (ân, ânhâ, hamân, hamânhâ) are either used neutrally (i.e. not denoting distance from the speaker) or natively (i.e. indicating remoteness); but proximal pronouns (in, inhâ, hamin, haminhâ) are always used natively and indicate proximity to the speaker. English doesn't have such a feature.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Personal pronouns"]},"\nPersonal pronouns have two forms. One is their normal form called ",{"type":"'''","value":["free personal pronouns"]}," (free in the sense of \"not bound, separate\") and the other is their enclitic form called ",{"type":"'''","value":["bound personal pronouns"]},". Subjective pronouns of English: \"I, you, he, she, etc.\" are analogous to free personal pronouns but English does not have any equivalent for Persian's bound personal pronouns.\n\nPersian has formal and informal 2nd and 3rd person. In addition, people of higher ranks like kings usually use 1st person plural (we) rather than 1st person singular (I). So, plural forms can be considered as polite and formal forms of singulars.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Free"]},"\n",{"type":"{|","value":[["class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\""],["|-"],["!"],["!colspan=\"3\"|Singular"],["!colspan=\"3\"|Plural"],["|-"],["!"],["!Persian"],["!English"],["!French"],["!Persian"],["!English"],["!French"],["|-"],["!1st"],["|man"],["|I"],["|je"],["|mâ"],["|we"],["|nous"],["|-"],["!2nd"],["|to"],["|thou, you (informal)"],["|tu"],["|šomâ"],["|you (formal, singular and plural)",{"type":"<","value":["br"]}],["you (informal, plural)"],["|vous"],["|-"],["!rowspan=\"2\"|3rd"],["|u"],["|he, she"],["|il, elle"],["|išân"],["|he, she (formal)"],["|il, elle"],["|-"],["|ân"],["|he, she, it"],["|il, elle, ça"],["|ânhâ"],["|they"],["|ils, elles, on"]]},"\n\nIn spoken Persian, there is also ",{"type":"''","value":["šomâhâ"]}," used as the plural form of both informal and formal \"you\" (",{"type":"''","value":["to"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["šomâ"]},").\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Bound"]},"\nBound personal pronouns have various functions depending on the word class to which they attach. For example, when they are added to the end of a noun (phrase), they express possession e.g. pedaram (my father).

That's why Persian has been able to preserve the ",{"type":"''","value":["free word order"]}," feature:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" As we learned, the ",{"type":"'''","value":["accusative"]}," case is marked with the enclitic ",{"type":"''","value":["râ"]}," (a post-position)."]},{"type":"*","value":[" The ",{"type":"'''","value":["dative"]}," case is marked with the pre-position ",{"type":"''","value":["be"]}," (to)."]},{"type":"*","value":[" The ",{"type":"'''","value":["ablative"]}," case is marked with the pre-position ",{"type":"''","value":["az"]}," (from)."]},"\nEnglish marks none of these cases. For example, if you change the word order of \"the father kissed the daughter\" (accusative) to e.g. \"the daughter kissed the father\", the meaning completely changes. The same applies to \"the father helped the daughter\" (dative) and \"the father asked the daughter\" (ablative). As with Latin, by changing the word order, just the emphasis changes and the basic meaning is preserved: \n",{"type":"*","value":[" accusative: pedar ",{"type":"'''","value":["doxtar râ"]}," busid, ",{"type":"'''","value":["doxtar râ"]}," pedar busid"]},{"type":"*","value":[" dative: pedar ",{"type":"'''","value":["be doxtar"]}," komak kard, ",{"type":"'''","value":["be doxtar"]}," pedar komak kard"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ablative: pedar ",{"type":"'''","value":["az doxtar"]}," porsid, ",{"type":"'''","value":["az doxtar"]}," pedar porsid"]},"\nHence, Persian has three different sets of \"object pronouns\" as per the case. They are made from the adposition of the case and subjective pronouns e.g. mâ râ busid (s\/he kised us, accusative), be mâ komak kard (s\/he helped us, dative), az mâ porsid (s\/he asked us, ablative).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Possessives"]},"\nPersian does not have possessive adjectives as is found in English. In Persian, possession is expressed by adding \"bound personal pronouns\" to the end of the noun phrase (NP): \n",{"type":"*","value":["dustam: my friend (template: friend-am)"]},{"type":"*","value":["dustè xubam: my good friend (template: friend-è good-am).
