From 1850, an influx of convicts boosted the size of the colony and their labour helped shape the early architecture of the city.\n\nThe discovery of gold in the 1890s triggered a boom which, with subsequent mineral discoveries, has been a major part of the state's economy. Western Australia joined the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901.\n\nOnce a small, isolated city, its population overtook that of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Adelaide"]]}," in the 1980s, Perth remains Australia's fastest growing city, and in recent years has transformed from a relatively laid back city to a vibrant one.

Due to the high rate of migration to Perth, slightly less than half of Perth's residents were born outside Australia. Its proximity to Southeast Asia and Africa has led to an influx of migrants from countries such as Malaysia, South Africa and Thailand, and this is reflected in the diversity of cuisine available in Perth. If you wish to experience a cosmopolitan culture without the hustle and bustle of larger cities, perhaps Perth would be your cup of tea.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nThe City has a temperate Mediterranean type climate. Summers are hot and dry whilst winters are generally wet and mild. Summer temperatures average 30°C (86°F) between November and April. Maximum temperatures during the height of summer can reach and sometimes exceed the 40°C (104°F) mark. Very hot days tend to have very low humidity making conditions more bearable. \n\nIn the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Perth metropolitan area"]}," the summertime temperature rises rapidly during the morning, relived in the afternoon when the \"Fremantle Doctor\" blows inland from the ocean to cool the city by up to 15°C.

Minimum temperatures sometimes drop below 0°C on clear nights. Though Perth goes through lengthy dry spells, when it does rain, it pours. In the past storms with strong winds occasionally hammer a winter night, but they generally caused no more destruction than a toppled tree or flattened fence.

The metropolitan areas as well as the bushlands have many flowering species which often flower en-masse, so it is wise to purchase over-the-counter hay fever or antihistamines from a local chemist before making a trip to see them with minimal discomfort. Beach-goers from colder climes might find the summer months too harsh, so it is perhaps best to visit during March–April or October–November as well as taking a hat, sun-screen lotion and sunglasses. \n\nThe local inhabitants tend to holiday during the height of summer or winter, either to escape the climate, or to celebrate it.

The Esplanade Bus Port is another prime bus service location in the CBD, and is directly connected to Esplanade Station on the Mandurah and Joondalup Lines. Most train stations across Perth have bus transfers that service the more local area of the station.\n\nTrain services run every 5–10 minutes (this depends on the line and station) during peak hours, with many trains running express. Off peak and most of the day on weekends, trains run every 15min  and 30min after 19:00 and weekends.

Avoid these lines during peak if possible. Bicycles are not allowed on trains heading toward the city in the morning, or away from the city in the evening; they are also not allowed to enter or pass through Perth, Perth Underground or Esplanade stations.

Fail to pay a fine at all, and you could end up paying up to $20,000 in fines and court costs. A good tip to remember is, if you have a SmartRider, to use one of the red fare gates to enter the station, so you can also be sure you have \"tagged on\". Do the same when leaving.

There are numerous smaller companies that operate mainly out of the Central Business District. Fares are regulated by the state government and all dispatch companies charge the same rate. Flagfall is $3.90 during weekdays, increasing to $5.70 on week nights and weekends. The kilometre rate is $1.59\/km charged in $0.10 increments. Surcharges apply on designated holiday periods (New Year's Eve and Christmas Day) and on weekend nights between midnight and 5AM.

Drivers are known to avoid picking up drunken patrons from outside of pubs, clubs or from the entrance to Perth central station.

There are specially designated 'secure ranks' operating at these times where patrons can queue in (relative) safety. Another option is the late night Transperth trains and buses run specially for revellers after their night out.\n\nServices at ",{"type":"'''","value":["Perth Airport"]}," are generally reliable, but at offpeak times (1am - 8am), be prepare for a potential wait at the taxi-stand as the line of waiting taxis crawl in one by one. The frequency at night drops off but there should still be a few cars waiting to meet incoming planes. A typical taxi ride from the Domestic Airport to the City is around $30 ($35 from the International). There is a $2 airport tax payable on top of the fare.\n\nFor bookings made more than 24 hours in advance, you can request that your booking is pre-confirmed with a driver for an additional $9.00 fee.

Some areas such as Northbridge are also known to be 'trouble spots' on weekend nights and tourists should be careful. Perth citizens (as with most Australians) almost never carry firearms or other weaponry, therefore it is logical to avoid people and places whenever such things are observed and advise the local police service when safe to do so. Overall Perth is becoming safer, due to small alleyways and other niche problem zones being refurbished and unsuitable for loiterers.\n\nPolice are generally friendly and approachable. To contact the police, ambulance or fire brigade emergency service is \"000\" on the phone for emergencies.  \"131 444\" is the recommended number for 24\/7 Police assistance and general enquiries.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Transport"]},"\n\nTrains are generally safe with transit guards travelling in pairs, patrolling most scheduled trains after peak hour. All train stations have a time to next train as well as an emergency button which can be used to call transit guards should the need arise. All stations have live monitored cameras and these can be activated by the simple push of the emergency button. In the train, there are \"talk to driver\" buttons in every carriage, but some older trains do not have them on every door. From 2011 the Armadale Train line especially in the areas of Burswood and Carlisle has had some high profile assaults from gangs travelling on the train system . The gangs usually comprise disaffected Indigenous youth and although weapons are not usually involved attacks have become more vicious in their nature.\n\nThe bus network while generally safe, but after hours can be a little more dangerous than the train network, with extremely limited security patrols, and buses coming under increasing attacks by people throwing rocks and other anti social behaviour.

Though pedestrians have the legal right of way, some motorists choose to ignore this rule. In the case of a zebra crossing, cars should slow down for you though caution is advisable. If you do not notice a car slowing down, do not begin to cross. It is usually best to follow the lead of the locals and to move as a group.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Driving"]},"\n\nDriving in Perth can be straightforward as its highways tend to connect at various nodes making navigation easy. However, avoid travelling during business rush hour (between 7-9AM and 4-6PM), particularly in summer or hot days. Many of Perth's major roads were not designed for the volume of traffic currently experienced with recent high population growth. Perth drivers are increasingly known for being inconsiderate to other drivers on the roads during these times, which has also caused increased delays due to accidents. \n\nThere are a few rules to take care of while driving in Western Australia. When stopped at a train crossing, do not proceed until the flashing lights have stopped even if the boom gate has fully lifted as fines are issued. There is a lower tolerance towards speeding so even a small excess over the road limit may warrant in an infringement and or fine. It is not mandatory or always observed, however it is polite to keep a gap at an unmarked road crossing when stuck in traffic to allow access for turning vehicles. If you have noticed the lane next to you leave a gap in these places, it is polite do the same. It is always wise to take great care during merging traffic lanes, especially during rush hour (as per the above paragraph).
