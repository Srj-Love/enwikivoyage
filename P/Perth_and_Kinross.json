They operate many services linking all local communities. At peak time on weekdays busses can run as often as once every 5 minutes but on Sundays service can be much slower. Check the online timetables before planning a day out. If you miss a bus from a rural area there will usually be another one later, just how later can vary. Bus travel is normally safe but can get intimidating on Friday or Saturday nights. It is advised not to travel by bus after dark if you are unfamiliar with the route.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Itineraries"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Play Golf at Gleneagles"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.gleneagles.com\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat=56.285833"],["long=-3.7475"],["directions=Near Auchterarder"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=£32 to £230"],["content= Play golf at the site of the 2014 Ryder Cup (all courses are closed 20 - 30 Sep 2014 for the Cup).
