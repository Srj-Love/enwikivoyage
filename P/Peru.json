It's the rich natural resources and strong history as the centre of the ancient Inca and later colonial Spanish empires that inspire their nationalist sentiments.\n\nThe general view of the U.S. government isn't very positive either, due to the Peruvian economic dependence on the U.S and foreign policy decisions of their North-American neighbours.

However LAN and KLM flights are much better in quality. LAN and Iberia often fly in code share mode (1 plane, 2 flight codes) meaning if you've a LAN flight, you may have to check in at Iberia service desk or the opposite way, sometimes they send you from one to the next and back, so just queue at the shorter service desk.\nThere is an internal flight tax, around US$6, same conditions as the international one.\n\nWhen booking domestic flights, there are several Peruvian travel agencies that can get you your plane tickets for the \"Peruvian price\" for a fee of about US$20, you'll notice that the prices can vary by several hundred dollars for the SAME flights when looking at LANs Peruvian site (http:\/\/www.lan.com\/index-es-pe.html) and the USA site (http:\/\/www.lan.com\/index-en-us.html). You'll find that if you try to book the cheaper flights from the Peruvian site, they won't accept payment from American bank accounts (this is why you do it through a Peruvian travel agency). \n\nMake sure to confirm your ticket 72 hours in advance, as you'll risk being bumped off your flight if you don't.

Taxis are divided between \"formal\" taxis, painted and marked as such and have a sticker with SOAT, and informal ones, that are just cars with a windshield sticker that says \"Taxi\". The last ones are better left to the locals, especially if you don't speak Spanish. Apart from the more upscale radio taxi (also the more expensive ones), the fare is not fixed or metered, but it is negotiated with the driver before getting into the vehicle. Ask at your hotel or hostal about the rate you may expect to pay to ride to a specific location to have a point of reference. There is no tipping at taxis. \n\n\"Micros\" (from microbus), are small minivans or Coaster buses, also known as \"combis\" and \"custers\". They do not have actual bus stops (they exist, although in practice the driver won't stop unless you ask), but fixed routes. The direction is shown by boards in the windscreen or painted on the side. If you want to catch a bus, just give the driver a sign (raise your hand similar to hitch-hiking) to stop. If the bus is not completely overfilled (and sometimes when it is, too), it will stop to pick you up. During the ride, the ticket collector will ask you for the fee or, if there is not a ticket collector, you pay the driver when you get off (this is more common when taking longer trips where most people are going to the last stop, for example from Ollantaytambo to Urubamba).

In contrast to ",{"type":"''","value":["colectivos"]},", buses, and of course trains, start from fixed points, either the central bus terminal or the court of the appropriate bus company. It is a good idea to buy your ticket one day in advance so that you can be relatively sure of finding a seat. If you come directly before the bus leaves, you risk finding that there are no more seats available. In most bus terminals you need to buy a separate departure tax of 1 or 1,5 soles.\n\nIf you are so unlucky as to be taller than 1.80m\/5'11\", you will most likely be uncomfortable on the ride since the seats are much tighter than in Europe or some parts of North America. In this case, you can try to get the middle seat in the rear, but on dirt roads the rear swings heavily. In older buses, the seats in the first row are the best, but many buses have a driver cabin separated from the rest of the bus\nso that you look an a dark screen or a curtain rather than out the front windshield. In older buses, you can get one or two seats beside the driver, which gives you a good view of the passing landscape. In this case, don't be too surprised when the driver is chewing his coca leaves.\n\nFirst-class express buses, complete with video, checked luggage and even meal service, travel between major cities, but remember to bring ear plugs as the video on these buses may be played extra-loud for the majority of the trip. You may need to present a passport to purchase a ticket.\n\nMake sure that your luggage is rainproof since it is often transported on the roof of the bus when travelling in the Andes. \n\nAvoid bus companies that allow travellers to get into the bus outside the official stations. They are normally badly managed and can be dangerous, due both to unsafe practices or to highway robberies, which are unfortunately not uncommon. This should be heeded especially by female travellers going on their own. There are many shoddy bus services in Peru, and it's best to go with one of the major companies such as Cruz del Sur, Oltursa or Ormeño.

Buy\n1st class or buffet class (still higher), or you risk getting completely covered by luggage.

The Journey on board of the Train of the Andes, through the heart of Peru is simply breathtaking. It is an 11 hour experience where the train reaches an altitude of  4781m.a.s.l (15,681 ft) and goes through 69 tunnels, 58 bridges and makes 6 zigzags. In 1999, the company was privatized, in 2005, Ferrocarril Central Andino renovated their passenger wagons in a Luxurious and comfortable way which puts the railway in the list of the most famous trains along with the Orient Express and the Transsiberien.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By foot"]},"\nBeside the famous ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Inca trail"]]}," to Machu Picchu, you can do a lot of more hikes all along the Sierra, preferably in the dry season. The hiker's Mecca is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Huaraz"]]},", where you can find a lot of agencies that offer guided tours and\/or equipment to borrow. The thin vegetation in the higher Sierra makes off-trail hiking easy. Good maps are hard to find inside Peru. It is better to bring them from home. Make sure you have enough iodine to purify your drinking water. When hiking in higher altitude, good acclimatisation is absolutely necessary. Take a good sleeping bag with you, since nights in the Sierra may become bitterly cold (-10°C in 4,500 m altitude are normal, sometimes still colder). Beware of thunderstorms that may rise up very suddenly. Rapid falling temperature and hard rain falls are a serious danger in higher altitudes. Don't forget that the night lasts for 12 hours year-round, so a flashlight is a good idea. When hiking on higher, but not snow covered mountains, water may be rare. Getting alcohol for stoves is easy: Either buy the blue colored ",{"type":"''","value":["alcohol de quemar"]}," or, better, simply buy pure drinking alcohol. You can get this in every town for about 3 Soles (US$0.85) per liter. (Don't even think about drinking it). It won't be so easy to find special fuel for gasoline stoves.

This gives you a chance to get \"off the beaten track\" and explore some of the areas that haven't been transformed by tourism. An international driver's license is needed for driving in Peru.\n\nPeru has three main roads which run from north to south: the fully paved ",{"type":"''","value":["Panamericana"]}," (RN 1) which passes through the whole country; more to the east there are the partially paved ",{"type":"''","value":["Carretera de la Sierra"]}," (RN 3) as well as the ",{"type":"''","value":["Carretera Marginal de la Selva"]}," (RN 5). Most parts of these roads are toll roads in the direction from north to south. The main roads are connected by 20 streets from west to east. \n\nBeware that, aside from a few major roads which are in good condition, most roads are unpaved and your speed on them will be severely restricted. For these roads a 4WD is necessary. This is especially true during the rainy season from November to April. You should travel very well informed about your route. Take a good road map with you (e.g. ",{"type":"''","value":["Waterproof Peru Map"]}," by ITMB). On the web, ",{"type":"''","value":["cochera andina"]}," provides useful information about road conditions, travel times and distances for more than 130 routes in Peru.\n\nBe sure to bring plenty of gas, as gas stations in unpopulated areas are very rare and will oftentimes be closed. Purchasing gas late at night can be an adventure all its own, as even in more populated areas gas stations tend to close early and the pumps are locked. The owner of the station sometimes sleeps inside and, if you can rouse him, he will come out and let you fill up. Be aware of the higher gasoline consumption in the mountains which often increases to more than 20 l\/100 km (12 MPG) (5 gal\/62 mi). \n\nThe traffic regulations are almost the same as in Europe and the U.S. But locals tend to interpret them freely. You better honk in unclear situations, e.g. in curves and at crossings to indicate the right of way. Also note that traffic checkpoints tend to be scattered throughout the country and the police may try to extract bribes from foreigners for passage. It would be wise to travel with a native speaker who can navigate the roads and deal with law enforcement.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Touting"]},"\n\nLike in most countries, also in Peru there is a vast crowd of touts hanging around the airports and bus stations or bus terminals.

Although English is spoken by an increasing number of young people in Lima and to a limited extent in the most popular tourist spots, you'll find English far less commonly understood than you might expect in a country where tourism is such a big industry. \n\nLike in other Latin American countries, Peruvian Spanish replaces ",{"type":"''","value":["vosotros"]}," (and its 2nd-person plural conjugations) with ",{"type":"''","value":["ustedes"]}," (3rd-person plural).

As of 26 November 2013, US$1 = S\/.2.80 and 1€ = S\/.3.80 (S\/. is the symbol for \"nuevo sol\"). Coins are available in five, two and one sol, and in 50, 20, 10, 5 and 1 centimo. 5 and 1 centimo coins are not normally accepted outside of big supermarkets or banks, so avoid them (or bring them home for a collection or to give to friends). Notes are available at 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 soles denominations; 200 soles notes are uncommon and - just like large bills in other countries - will not be accepted in many places.\n\nATMs are available in big cities, upmarket hotels, and touristic areas. With a Cirrus or Maestro sign on it, you can withdraw cash easily. The exchange rate is the same as credit cards but fees are much lower. Some banks charge a fee for getting cash from their ATM's, with BBVA Banco Continental reportedly charging excessive fees without telling you in advance. Make sure to carry sufficient cash when visiting smaller towns, as your credit card or traveler checks might not be accepted there. \n\nCredit cards and travelers checks are common. Although cash has a ca. 2% better change rate, you are strongly advised not to carry large amounts of cash on your journey. The Banco de Credito (BCP) gives good rates on traveler checks. Rates in change offices are often somewhat worse. It's always worth comparing them before changing your money. When changing your money in change offices, check their calculations. Most of them make calculations on the fly for the amount you want using an electronic calculator in plain view, even showing you the process step by step (unless they are brutally obvious, like changing tens or hundreds). If they ",{"type":"''","value":["don't"]}," show, keep the money in your pocket and find someone that does. \n\nAlways keep in mind that counterfeiting is a big problem in Peru: make sure to get familiar with the money and do not hesitate to reject any note or coin (especially the 5 sol coins) that look suspicious, just like any Peruvian would do. In other words, if you want to look like a savvy foreigner, take 10 seconds to check any paper note you get, even at a bank. All bills have a watermark and security stripe, and the large number on the extreme right denoting the denomination of the bill will change from purple to green when viewed at an angle. Don't take any note that is ripped; you won't be able to use it anywhere else but a bank.\n\nIf you are stuck with a counterfeit coin or note, if you try to use it at big stores they may want to confiscate it. Don't accept damaged\/ripped bills, since you will have to take them to a bank in order to change them into new ones before you can spend them. Be especially careful when exchanging money with money-changers on the street (a common way for counterfeit money to enter the money supply) or at the border (notably the one with Ecuador). \n\nTypically, small bills are very helpful to carry around.  Change large bills into small ones as often as possible.  If you only have 50 and 100 Soles notes on you, consider changing them at a bank.  Local merchants and taxistas often claim to not have any change on them, forcing you to wait in public while they search for some (potentially dangerous) and sometimes with the hope that you'll grow impatient and let them keep the change.\n\nIn Peru, it's not as common for US$ to be accepted in transactions as in other countries (such as Ecuador), but some nice, new 10 or 20 US$ bills can be helpful in some situations. Often in small towns, local shops will change money for you. If so, it will be clearly marked.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Costs"]},"\nIf you're on a budget, you can get around well for US$50 a day. Basic hotels or hostels (",{"type":"''","value":["hospedajes"]},") are available everywhere, with dorm beds in youth hostels typically costing US$8-15. You'll find plenty of very cheap restaurants (US$0.50-1.50) but for slightly more (US$2 -3) you'll get an often much better lunch or dinner at better restaurants. Fancy restaurants are available in every city, with menus starting from US$20.\n\nBuses are a fairly cheap way to get around. A 10 hour bus ride in a normal bus (not \"Royal Class\" or something like that) will set you back about US$6. If you can afford it, the more luxurious seats go for about double the price but will make a great difference in terms of comfort. Avoid bus companies that allow travellers to get into the bus outside the official stations. They are often badly managed and can be dangerous, due both to unsafe practices or to highway robberies, which are unfortunately not uncommon. This should be heeded especially by female travellers on their own. Your hotel, hostel or a local tourist information booth can point you to the better options.\n\nTrains (except the ones for Machu Picchu, which are relatively expensive) run for similar fees.\n\nDon't forget to retain your exit fee of US$30.25  They do accept USD or Soles for the fee and be sure to pay the exit fee before you get in line for security checks or you'll get to wait again.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Handicrafts"]},"\n\nPeru is famous for a lot of different, really nice and relatively cheap handicrafts.

Peruvian geography offers at least 8 different climates (desert along the coast, steep and high mountains, the Amazon basin).

In the Sierra, trout (",{"type":"''","value":["truchas"]},") are bred in several places. A very common fish dish is ceviche, raw fish prepared by marination in lime juice. Popular variations of the dish can include shellfish, and even sea urchin. The exact recipe and mode of preparation of ceviche will vary from region to region. Definitely worth a try, especially in summer, but cleanliness and sanitation make all the difference.  Use care when buying from street vendors and remember that it is often served spicy. \n\nThroughout Peru there is a wide variety of potato dishes (",{"type":"''","value":["papas"]},", not ",{"type":"''","value":["patatas"]}," as in Spain), the traditional Andean vegetable.  Papa a la Huancaina is a tasty dish of potato slices and diced boiled egg topped with a thin, creamy yellow sauce, and usually includes a lettuce leaf and an olive or two.  (A similar green sauce, called Ocopa, can be served over potatoes or yuca.) Papa rellena is mashed potato reformed into a potato-like shape, but with meat, vegetables, and other spicy filling in the middle.  Aji de gallina is shredded chicken in a thick, spicy, cheese-based sauce over sliced potatoes, often with an olive and slice of hard-boiled egg.  Causa is mashed potato layered with mayonnaise-based tuna or chicken salad mixed with hot peppers.\n\nMany Peruvian dishes can contain strong condiments and be heavy, so if you have a weak stomach, proceed with caution.\n\nNowadays, the transport routes from the flat jungle areas are good enough to supply all the country with vegetables and fruits.
