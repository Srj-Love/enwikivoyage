Agriculture is and always was central to the town's identity.  In the early part of the 1900s, Petaluma was known as the \"Egg Basket of the World\" due to the large number of chicken farms nearby.  Although electronic industries, especially telecom, have started displacing Petaluma's numerous cattle, chicken, and sheep ranches, much of Petaluma still maintains the feel of the old cow-town.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThere are a few ways to enter the city.

Volpi's is a hot Italian restaurant serving full seven-course family-style meals and the best eggplant parmesan.  Hiro's is a popular sushi bar, and down the block is Old Chicago Pizza, with some of the thickest-crust pizza you'll see.  And, Thai lovers will want to try all FIVE Thai restaurants within a one-mile stretch along the Boulevard. Thai Ginger is a particular standout with a small patio and award-winning food for a low to moderate price. Grazziano's is an excellent, though expensive Italian restaurant on Petaluma Boulevard between Western and Washington Streets. Another fantastic moderate to upscale restaurant featuring California-style cuisine is Graffiti, which features a beautiful view of the Petaluma River Basin, an outstanding bar, and consistently good dining and service.\n\nNumerous small, upscale bistros abound. \n\nFor a delicious, reasonably priced meal, absolutely try the Mexican seafood at Mi Pueblo. The camarones fajitas, fish tacos, and tamales are all immaculate.\n\nFor a quick cafe-style breakfast or lunch, or just a cup of tea or coffee, some best bets are Della Fattoria (where you can also grab some of the best olive bread and other fantastic pastries to go) with excellent soup, salad, sandwich combinations as well as the Tea Room, which has a light, seasonal menu featuring tons of salads and sandwiches as well as many fine brunch items. Both have some limited outdoor seating.\n\nYou can find outstanding Indian AND Nepalese food at Himalayan Kabob & Curry House and unexpectedly good Turkish fare at Real Doner, which is relaxed and deli-style with an outdoor patio. The doners, dolmas, and mezes (appetizer plate) are sublime. \n\nMany more great restaurants exist outside of downtown Petaluma.  Try Cattlemen's Steakhouse for locally grown beef and heartier fare, Chunky's Taqueria & Grill, and Giacomo's Italian Restaurant, to name a few.\n\nVegetarians will have no problem here. Equally, vegans and people on gluten-free diets shouldn't have any real trouble.
