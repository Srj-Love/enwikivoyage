Peterborough emerged as the region's industrial capital after the building of a major rail junction just outside the historic city centre. Designated a 'New Town' in 1967 the city expanded rapidly during the 1970s and 1980s. Home to a large second-generation Italian population, and a later influx of Asian immigrants, more recently the city has been a destination for Eastern European migrants. The city centre has been extensively redeveloped and is dominated by the Queensgate shopping mall, leaving only a small central area of historic interest remaining, which includes the Cathedral and its environs.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By road"]},"\n\nFrom ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]},", take the A1(M) northwards.
