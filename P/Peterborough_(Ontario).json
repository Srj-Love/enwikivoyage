This is a varied community -- a retirement city, but at the same time a university and college city.  It has a permanent population of approximately 80,000.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nConsidering that Peterborough is located between two major Canadian cities (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Toronto"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ottawa"]]},"), it has managed to maintain a small-town friendly feel to it. By many, Peterborough is considered a retirement community; however, during the school year there is a thriving student population, both domestic and international. Peterborough with its relaxed atmosphere and laid back attitude allows the days to go by unnoticeably. There is a big arts community in the city also, meaning Peterborough is the best place in Central and Southern Ontario to create a band, become an artist and simply showcase your talent.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe city of Peterborough is reachable by Greyhound intercity bus services from Toronto (8 times a day) and Ottawa (approx. 2X a day).

Highway 28 forms a central spine through the Kawarthas and also runs through Peterborough.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe City of Peterborough has a fairly inconvenient public transit system, though they have made efforts to improve it in recent years. Adult bus fare is $2.50 as of January 2013, and the buses run to and from downtown bus terminal every 40 minutes, but are often either late or early, so arrive in advance. One positive aspect about the centrally located bus terminal is that the buses wait for each other, and depart at the same time. This is the leading cause for their sporadic times, but it is convenient if you need two buses to go somewhere. Getting from downtown to Trent University is much easier, as there is a separate bus system, Trent West, and Trent East. During the school year they run every 10-20 minutes. Trent Weekend runs every 30-60 minutes on the weekends, and the holiday schedule is similar. Peterborough downtown is walking-friendly, and most of the attractions and parks are within walking distance. Any farther trips will require a car or the transit bus. Lots of people bike around also, which is strongly encouraged, especially in the warmer months of the year.\n\nThere are good bike paths leading north west out of the downtown core, through Jackson's Park, that continue for several kilometers to the outskirts of the city. There is also a bike path along the east side of the Trent River that leads up to Trent University and, beyond that, all the way north to Lakefield.\n\nHailing a cab in downtown Peterborough is somewhere between difficult and impossible, so your best bet is to call in advance.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Ptbo lift lock.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["275px"],["The Peterborough Lift Lock"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Visit the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Peterborough Liftlock"]},", the highest hydraulic liftlock in the world, on Hunter Street at Ashburnham Drive.
