The exploitation of coal deposits in and around Petrila made the town grow as a single-industry town, revolving either around the mining of coal or the processing of the coal mined there, which is listed under the grade “Pitcoal” . Mining operations began in 1840, but the town would remain sparsely populated until the arrival of Moldovian workers forced to relocate by the former president of Romania Nicolae Ceauşescu under Communist rule. The restructuring of the economy since 1989 has led to a decrease in production and supply for the region, including Petrila.\n\nRazvan Radulescu, a Romanian author, used the town of Petrila as a location in his 2006 fantasy novel Theodosius the Small.\n\nIt was the site in recent times of the Petrila Mine disaster, wherein two methane gas explosions in a coal mine on November 15, 2008 killed at least 12 miners and\/or rescue workers. This is not the first time this millennium a coal mine in Petrila has suffered such an incident; another similar incident occurred in 2001\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nYou can reach Petrila from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Petrosani"]]}," (7 km).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Phone"]},"\nPetrila area code is 254 for Romtelecom and 354 for RDS.If you are calling from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Romania"]]}," you must dial 0254(0354) and if you are calling from abroad you must dial +40254(+40354).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Petrosani"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Hateg"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Hunedoara"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Deva"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Orastie"]]}]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Hunedoara"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Petrila"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["45.451111111111"],["23.398055555556"]]}]
