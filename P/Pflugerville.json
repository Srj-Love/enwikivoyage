Excellent food, large portions, friendly staff, authentic atmosphere.   For appetizers don't miss the mariquitas (fried plantain with a garlic dipping sauce) or yuca frita (fried yucca).  For the main dish try the Asado de Res (flame broiled flank steak), Ropa Vieja (shredded beef in a delicious sauce), Lechon Asado (roasted pork), or Pescado a la Criolla (fish in a creole style sauce).  Side dishes include all the typical Caribbean favorites such as rice & beans, tostones, or congri.  Maduros (also known as amarillos) are sweet ripe plantains, and although not on the menu are usually available if you ask.  If you still have room for dessert, the Tres Leches cake is delicious, drenched in a creamy sauce."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["30.43944"],["-97.62000"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Central Hill Country"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Pflugerville, Texas"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North_America\/United_States\/Texas\/Localities\/P\/Pflugerville\/"]]}]
