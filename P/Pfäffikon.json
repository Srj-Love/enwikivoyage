[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.pfaeffikonsz.ch\/ Pfäffikon SZ"]}]}," is a small city in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Central Switzerland"]]}," located in the greater Zürich metropolitan area, between the Lake of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zurich"]]}," and the Obersee. Pfäffikon is home to about 7'000 people and is the third biggest city in the canton Schwyz. The former farmer village has turned into a mini financial center due to is favourable location on the border between Northeastern and Central Switzerland and it's liberal tax regime. Pfäffikon has seen a massive establishment of international headquarters and movement of big industrial and financial companies to the city in the last two decades. Therefore during the week the small city is bustling with business travellers from multinational companies while during the weekend it is very calm. This town in canton Schwyz should not be confused with ",{"type":"'''","value":["Pfäffikon ZH"]}," which is in the canton of Zurich.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nSince Pfäffikon is within the Zürich metropolitan area, it is served by its suburban trains (Zürich S-Bahn). The S2, S5 and S8 lines all offer 2 trains per hour to Zürich Hbf, of which the S2 is the fastest (35 min), followed by S8 (42 min) and S5 (45 min). S2 and S8 use the same route to Zürich Hbf; however, S2 makes limited stops along the line and S8 all stops. It is also possible to use the S2 to get to Zürich Airport (50-55 min). All-zone day and monthly cards are fully valid (see ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.zvv.ch\/en"]}," for more information). Don't go to Pfäffikon ",{"type":"'''","value":["ZH"]}," by mistake!\n\nAlso, IR-trains and IC-trains to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chur"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Basel"]]}," have hourly stops.\n\nIf you prefer the car then the Autobahn A3 to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chur"]]},"\/",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zurich"]]}," brings you to Pfäffikon. Keep in mind the loads of commuters so in the morning and evening rush hour it might take 15-20 minutes more as the main road (Churerstrasse) is utilized beyond its capacity. There is also the entry\/exit Schindellegi on the A3 but entry is only in the direction to Chur and exit in direction to Zurich (not both ways!)\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Pfaeffikon.png"],["thumb"],["right"],["350px"],["Overview Pfäffikon"]]},"\nPfäffikon is a town so the best options are by foot or bicycle.

Pfäffikon is part of the regional public traffic system (ZVV) so a valid ZVV ticket (or SBB ticket in case of intra-Swiss travel) is sufficient. Orientation is easy as Churerstrasse is the main divider of the town. It starts in the industrial area close to the Autobahn and followed by the Seedamm Center next to Autobahn entry\/exit of Pfäffikon.
