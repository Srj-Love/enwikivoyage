[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Phra Nakhon Khiri Historical Park banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Phetchaburi"]}," (เพชรบุรี) - pronounced and sometimes spelled ",{"type":"'''","value":["Phetburi"]}," - is the provincial capital of Phetchaburi Province.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Understand "]},"\nPhetchaburi is the capital city of Phetchaburi Province, about 120 km southwest of Bangkok. The city is one of the oldest settlements in Thailand, mentioned in historical records dating to the 8th century, and having significant standing artifacts dating to the 12th century. There are numerous temples in and around the city centre and market area, in addition to the Royal Palace, known informally as Khao Wang, that dominates the skyline. The city is on the River Phet (\"diamond\" in Thai), which originates in Kaeng Krachan National Park and flows into the Gulf of Siam at Baan Laem.\n\nPhetchaburi is a predominantly agricultural province, and the city reflects this with a large and thriving traditional market, buzzing with activity from pre-dawn until mid-day, and replete with the aromas of everything. It is very much a working city, with few tourists or the infrastructure to support them.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\nFrom Bangkok, the ",{"type":"'''","value":["blue-white"]}," express buses (Bus 977, Bus 72) from Bangkok's Southern Bus Terminal (Sai Tai Mai) (dark blue ticket booth 89, departure Platform 6) will take you directly to Phetchaburi's bus terminal, which is adjacent to a night market. Express buses leave Bangkok every two hours between 11:00 and 17:00, and you should allow two hours for the journey, which will cost 112 baht. There are also minibuses, same ticket booth and departure platform, but they do not provide extra space for bigger pieces of luggage. Take care to avoid the ",{"type":"'''","value":["blue, white and orange"]}," buses as they will stop many times and will take much longer to reach Phetchaburi.  \n\nYou can also reach Phetchaburi by train from Hualamphong Station. The journey normally takes around four hours, but can occasionally take longer. This will cost 100-250 baht, depending on the type of train.\n\nA taxi from Bangkok should cost no more than 2,000 baht and should take around two hours.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nPhetchaburi itself is blissfully free of traffic snarls, except on the main north-south highway that bisects the province, but by-passes the town.\n\nThere are no meter taxis. There are tuk-tuks, motorcycle taxis, and for a slow cruise around the market area, plenty of traditional two-seat pedal-power tricycle taxis. Whatever your means of transportation, it would be a good idea to have your destination written down in Thai for the driver.\n\nFor longer journeys around the province there are local buses (trucks with benches) available from the market area, but you need to ask the drivers for their destinations (you will quickly be directed to the correct bus).\n\nMost of the important temples, except Khao Wang, are within walking distance of the market area.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" See "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Phra Thinang Wechayan Wichien Prasat.jpeg"],["thumb"],["Phra Thinang Wechayan Wichien Prasat, Phra Nakhon Khiri historical park"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Khao Loung Caves"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=A bit N of the city"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=Free"],["content=Two sets of giant caves.

For Thai silk and clothing, the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Big C"]}," hypermarket on the main highway carries a modest selection, as do a handful of shops in the market area.\n\nSerious souvenir-hunters might wish to head south about 65 km to ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hua Hin"]},", where there are plenty of high-class souvenir shops.\n\nPhetchaburi Province is famous throughout Thailand for its Thai dessert, ",{"type":"'''","value":["khanom Thai"]},", delicious candy-like finger food made from egg, palm sugar, coconut and a binding agent, usually crushed beans or flour. The main north-south highway is dotted with large stores offering a bewildering variety of such sweetmeats, if your waistline can cope.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Eat "]},"\nLike all Thai cities, Phetchaburi has hundreds of restaurants and cafes serving almost every variety of Thai food. Many of them specialise in just a few menu items, so the trick is to decide what you want to eat before you decide on where to eat. There are almost no English language signs or menus, so specific recommendations are not especially helpful. On the other hand, whichever of these cafes or restaurants you choose to frequent, your chances of not being served a wholesome Thai dish are very low.\n\nIf you wish to be \"safe,\" the two hotels mentioned below have restaurants that will likely not disappoint you. In addition, the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Big C"]}," has several Western-style franchises under its roof (e.g., Chester's Grill, KFC), with air conditioning and English language menus. But be advised this establishment suffers from severe noise pollution.\n\nApart from a few Chinese restaurants, the Big C franchises and two pizza parlours in peripheral locations, anything other than Thai food is almost impossible to find in Phetchaburi city.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Drink "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["drink"],["name=Present Bar"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Across the street from the cable car"],["phone="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=A local Thai hangout."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Sleep "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Royal Diamond"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Near the by-pass"],["phone=+66 32 411061"],["fax="],["hours="],["price=1,200+ baht"],["content=It is not especially convenient, as is not close to the market area although it is close to Khao Wang.
