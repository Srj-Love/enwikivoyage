Nurtured by two rivers, the Yom and the Nan running parallel to one another north to south, the land is agriculturally fertile. Once the site of an ancient town dating back almost a thousand years ago, Phichit has played in a major role in the history of both Sukhothai and Ayutthaya.\n\nKnown as land of the crocodiles, it has been home to this reptile which has thrived in its waters. There are today several freshwater crocodile farms. Phichit features in the Thai epic Krai Thong (ไกรทอง) composed by King Rama II which tells of Chalawan (ชาละวัน), a powerful crocodile king.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThe main ancient sight is the large prang of Wat Mahathat.
