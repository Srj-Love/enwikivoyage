Direct descendants of these people can still be found in Negros Oriental. Several thousand years later, they were then followed by Austronesian settlers travelling the same route as the Negritos but this time over sea in their impressive ",{"type":"''","value":["Balangay"]}," boats. This word is where the basic form of political institution, the barangay, came from. The Austronesian ethnic\/linguistic group includes Malays, Indonesians and Polynesians. The ones entering the Philippines are thought to have come from Taiwan, and traveled south to the Philippines, and as far away as Hawaii, Easter island, New Zealand and Madagascar. The majority of Filipinos are of Austronesian descent.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Pre-Spanish era"]},"\nThe early Austronesians of the Philippines simultaneously traded with each other as well as with the Chinese, Japanese, Okinawans, Indians, Thais, Arabs and other Austronesians from the Malay Peninsula and Nusantara (today's Malaysia and Indonesia) and Micronesia. An interesting mix of cultures developed in the islands, and a writing system called ",{"type":"''","value":["baybayin"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["alibata"]},", as well as a social structure developed quickly, some of the traders stayed and married the natives. Hinduism and Buddhism were introduced by traders from India, Sumatra and Java. These two religions syncretized with the various indigenous animistic beliefs. Later, Arab, Malay and Javanese traders converted the natives in the island of Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago to Islam. The archipelago became a mix of the indigenous Austronesian and Melanesian people with some foreign influence from Arabia, the Malay lands and India.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Under Spanish rule"]},"\nWhen the explorer ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ferdinand Magellan"]}," set foot on the island of Homonhon in 1521, the Philippines was predominantly animist, with some Muslim and Hindu inhabitants mainly in the southern part of the country. Famished, Magellan's crew were treated to a feast by the welcoming islanders who wore elaborate tattoos. Magellan was Portuguese, but it was a Spanish Expedition which he led to the islands which were eventually claimed by Spain as its colony. Lapu-Lapu, a native chief of Mactan island, was against the Christianization of the natives; he then fought a battle with Magellan where Lapu-Lapu won while Magellan was killed. The Philippines was later named for ",{"type":"'''","value":["Crown Prince Philip II"]}," of Spain and most of the natives converted to Catholicism. Some Muslims in the south and various animistic mountain tribes, however, resisted Spanish conquest and Catholic conversion. \n\nThe longest revolt against Spanish colonization was led by Francisco Dagohoy in Bohol and this lasted for 85 years covering the period of 1744-1829. As a ",{"type":"''","value":["cabeza de barangay"]}," or barangay captain, Dagohoy opposed the Spanish colonizers which were represented by priests and civil leaders and required payment of excessive taxes and tributes. They also oppressed the Philippines' natives by subjecting them as slaves and sending them to prison for disobeying rules. The Manila Galleon trade made contact between the Philippines and Mexico as well as the whole of the Americas. Mayans and Aztecs settled in the Philippines and introduced their cultures which were then embraced by the Filipinos. The Philippines received heavy influence from Mexico and Spain and the archipelago became \"hispanicized\". Other Asians used the Manila Galleon trade to migrate to the West. During the Spanish rule, people such as the Dutch, Portuguese and British tried to colonize the country, however only the British did so and it lasted for a desultory 2 years in the modern-day capital: Manila. The Philippines remained a Spanish colony for over 300 years until 1899 when it was ceded by Spain to the United States following the Spanish-American War.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["American and Japanese occupation"]},"\nThe Filipinos declared independence on 12 June 1898 and resisted the American occupation and colonization for seven long, brutal years until surrender completed the colonization of the Philippines. The American presence remained until World War II when, in turn, Japan invaded the Philippines. The Japanese occupation lasted from 1941 to 1945 when General Douglas McArthur fulfilled his promise and \"liberated\" the country from the Japanese. In 1946, the Philippines was granted independence by the US, becoming the first country in Southeast Asia to gain independence from a colonial power, although the US maintained a significant military presence, especially in the Subic Naval Base in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zambales"]]}," and Clark Air Base in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Angeles City"]]},". It was not until many years later in the early 1990's that the US bases were returned to the Philippines.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Pre-Modern Era"]},"\nUp until the 1960s, the Philippines was widely considered to be the second most developed country in Asia after Japan. Several decades of misrule by the corrupt dictator Ferdinand Marcos then plunged the country into deep debt. Poverty became widespread and infrastructure for development was severely lacking. In 1986, the People Power uprising finally overthrew the Marcos government. (This was called the EDSA Revolution since the majority of the demonstrations took place on ",{"type":"'''","value":["E"]},"pifanio ",{"type":"'''","value":["d"]},"e los ",{"type":"'''","value":["S"]},"antos ",{"type":"'''","value":["A"]},"venue.)

The country suffered slightly in the 1997 Asian financial crisis that led to a second EDSA revolt which overthrew President Joseph Estrada; the then vice-president, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (daughter of one of the former presidents), took his place. After her term ended in 2010, Benigno Aquino III (nicknamed \"Noynoy\" and \"Pnoy\"), son of Corazon and Benigno Aquino, Jr., was elected President. Growth in the Philippines is slow, but it is hopeful about catching up with its neighbours. In 2009 Typhoon Ondoy (Ketsana) stormed the country, flooding the whole of Metropolitan Manila in just a day, leaving casualties.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["People"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Luneta, Manila, Philippines.jpg"],["thumb"],["Luneta Park"]]},"\nAs of 2012, the Philippines has a population estimated at 103 million making it the twelfth-largest nation on earth. Since the Philippines population is still growing rapidly, while that of Japan is declining, it will probably shortly overtake its northern neighbors to join the top ten. \n\nFrom its long history of Western occupation - 300 years by Spain and 40 years by the US - its people have evolved as a unique blend of East and West in both appearance and culture. Filipinos are largely Austronesian (more specifically Malayo-Polynesian) in ethnic origin. However, many people, particularly in the cities of Luzon and the Visayas, have ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China"],["Chinese"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Japan"]]},"ese, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["India"]]},"n, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Spanish"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United States"],["American"]]}," mixtures. Those living in the provinces are mostly of Austronesian origin (known as \"native\"). Many Muslims in the Sulu archipelago near Borneo have ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Arabic"],["Arab"]]},", Indian and Chinese mixtures. The four largest foreign minorities in the country are: Chinese, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Korea"]]},"ns, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Indian"]]},"s and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Japan"]]},"ese. Also of significance are Americans, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Indonesia"]]},"ns and Arabs. Spaniards and other Europeans form a very small proportion of the country's population.\n\nFilipino traits are a confluence of many cultures. Filipinos are famous for the ",{"type":"''","value":["bayanihan"]}," or spirit of kinship and camaraderie taken from Austronesian forefathers. They observe very close family ties. Roman Catholicism comes from the Spaniards who were responsible for spreading the Christian faith across the archipelago. The Spaniards introduced Christianity (Roman Catholicism) and succeeded in converting the overwhelming majority of Filipinos. At least 83% of the total population belongs to the Roman Catholic faith. The Philippines is one of only two countries in Asia with a majority Roman Catholic population (the other being ",{"type":"[[","value":[["East Timor"]]},").\n\nThe genuine and pure expression of hospitality is an inherent trait in Filipinos, especially those who reside in the countryside who may appear very shy at first, but have a generous spirit, as seen in their smiles. Hospitality, a trait displayed by every Filipino, makes these people legendary in South-east Asia. Guests will often be treated like royalty in Philippine households. This is most evident during fiestas when even virtual strangers are welcomed and allowed to partake in the feast that most, if not all, households have during the occasion. At times, this hospitality is taken to a fault. Some households spend their entire savings on their fiesta offerings and sometimes even run into debt just to have lavish food on their table. They spend the next year paying for these debts and preparing for the next fiesta. At any rate, seldom can you find such hospitable people who enjoy the company of their visitors. Perhaps due to their long association with Spain, Filipinos are emotional and passionate about life in a way that seems more Latin than Asian.\n\nFilipinos lead the bunch of English-proficient Asian people today and English is considered as a second language.  The American occupation was responsible for teaching the Filipino people the English language. While the official language is Filipino (which is basically the Tagalog dialect) and whereas 76-78 languages and 170 dialects exist in this archipelago, still English is the second most widely spoken language in the country to varying degrees of comprehension but is a learnt language. Around 3 million still speak Spanish, including Creole Spanish, Chavacano plus Spanish has been reintroduced as a language of instruction at school level.\n\nThe geographical and cultural grouping of Filipinos is defined by region, where each group has a set of distinct traits and dialects - the sturdy and frugal Ilocanos of the north, the industrious Tagalogs of the central plains, the loving and sweet Visayans from the central islands, and the colorful tribesmen and religious Muslims of Mindanao. Tribal communities or minorities are likewise scattered across the archipelago.\n\nIt may seem peculiar for tourists to notice the Latin flair in Filipino culture. Mainstream Philippine culture compared to the rest of Asia is quite Hispanic and westernized at the surface. But still, Filipinos are essentially Austronesian and many indigenous and pre-Hispanic attitudes and ways of thinking are still noticeable underneath a seemingly westernized veneer. Indigenous groups, who have retained a fully Malayo-Polynesian culture unaffected by Spanish-influence, are also visible in cities like Manila, Baguio, Davao or Cebu, and can remind a visitor of the amazing diversity and multiculturalism present in the country.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Politics"]},"\nThe government of the Philippines is largely based on the political system of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United States"]]},". The President of the Philippines is elected directly by the people, and serves as both the Head of State and Head of Government. \n\nThe legislature consists of a bicameral congress, which consists of a lower house known as the ",{"type":"''","value":["Kapulungan ng mga Kinatawan"]}," (House of Representatives), and an upper house known as the ",{"type":"''","value":["Senado"]}," (Senate). Both houses are elected directly by the people, though the country is divided into districts for the election of the lower house, while the upper house is elected by the country as a whole.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Religion"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:San Agustin (inside).jpg"],["thumb"],["The interior of San Agustin Church, Intramuros, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Manila"],["Manila"]]}]]},"\nThe Philippines is not only the largest Christian country in Asia but also the world's third largest Roman Catholic nation. The Roman Catholic faith remains the single biggest legacy of three hundred years of Spanish colonial rule. Catholicism is still taken quite seriously in the Philippines. Masses still draw crowds from the biggest cathedrals in the metropolis to the smallest parish chapels in the countryside.  During Holy Week, most broadcast TV stations close down or operate only on limited hours and those that do operate broadcast religious programs.  The Catholic Church also still exerts quite a bit of influence even on non-religious affairs such as affairs of state. Mores are changing slowly, however; Filipinos are now slowly accepting what were previously taboo issues in as far as Roman Catholic doctrine is concerned, such as artificial birth control, premarital sex, and the dissolution of marriage vows.　\n\nThe biggest religious minority are Muslim Filipinos who primarily live in Mindanao and the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), but also increasingly in cities such as Manila, Baguio or Cebu in the north and central parts of the country. They account for around 5% of the population. Islam is the oldest continually practiced organized religion in the Philippines, with the first conversions made in the 12th century AD. Islam became such an important force that Manila at the time of the Spanish arrival in the 16th century was a Muslim city. Many aspects of this Islamic past are seen in certain cultural traits many mainstream Christian Filipinos still exhibit (such as eating and hygiene etiquette) and has added to the melting pot of Filipino culture in general. Sadly, Terrorist attacks and violent confrontations between the Filipino army and splinter militant Islamic organizations such as the Abu Sayyaf and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front have strained relations between Muslim and the non-Muslim Filipinos in rural areas in the south. Yet, the Muslim Filipinos are much more liberal in their interpretations of Islam, and like the Muslims of Indonesia, are generally more relaxed regarding such topics as gender-segregation or the hijab (veil) than South Asians or Middle Eastern Muslims.\n\nIndian Filipinos, Chinese Filipinos, and Japanese Filipinos are mostly Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Shinto, and Taoist which all accounts for 3% of the population of the Philippines. These populations have been in the country for centuries preceding Spanish rule, and many aspects of Buddhist and Hindu belief and culture are seen in the mainstream culture of Christian or Muslim Filipinos as well. As with many things in the Philippines, religion statistics are never clear-cut and defined, and many Christians and Muslims also practice and believe in indigenous spiritual aspects (such as honoring natural deities and ancestor-worship, as well as the existence of magic and healers) that may in some cases contradict the orthodox rules of their religions.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nThe climate is tropical, with March to May (summer) being the hottest months.

Road atlases and maps are available at bookstores throughout the country, and are very helpful when driving, especially when driving alone.\n\nMajor international car rental companies such as Hertz ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.hertzphilippines.com"]}," and Budget ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.budget.com.ph\/"]}," have offices in Metro Manila, notably at the airport.

There are also local car rental companies, such as Nissan Rent-a-Car ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.nissanrentacar.com"]},".  Regardless of the company, prices are bound to be reasonable.\n\nCar rental companies usually allow either self-drive or chauffeur-driven rentals: some types of cars however (like vans) may only be rented out with a chauffeur.  Also, some rental companies (mostly local ones) may only allow rentals to be driven within the island where the city of rental is located: for example, it may be possible to drive with a rental from Manila to Legazpi (both on Luzon), but not from Manila (Luzon) to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tacloban"]]}," (Leyte) because it would entail the use of roll-on\/roll-off (RO\/RO) ferries.  If you intend to drive out of Luzon and into the outlying islands, the Visayas or Mindanao (and\/or vice-versa), be sure that the rental company's terms and conditions allow it.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Road networks"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:NLEx.jpg"],["thumbnail"],["The North Luzon Expressway (NLEX)"]]},"\nIn addition to the existing network of national and local roads, the Philippines has two additional road networks: an expressway network and the Strong Republic Nautical Highway (SRNH) system.\n\nLuzon has an expressway network dominated by the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) and South Luzon Expressway (SLEX). These are tollways with good paved roads, are privately-maintained, and the farthest tolls will not cost more than a few dollars from Metro Manila.  Other expressways include the Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway (a 94-kilometer 4-lane freeway connecting ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Subic Bay"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tarlac"]]},") and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bataan"]]}," Provincial Expressway.  Expressways are connected to the network of national highways and provincial roads which connect to major cities and provinces.\n\nThe Strong Republic Nautical Highway system is a three-route network of national and provincial roads, bridges and roll-on\/roll-off (RO\/RO) ferries which facilitates the connection of major islands of the Philippines together by road, bringing down the cost of driving (and, ultimately, lowering the cost of shipping goods between islands).  The SRNH system begins in Luzon, runs in a north-south direction through the Visayas, and ultimately ends in Mindanao.  The SRNH is useful for driving to tourist destinations outside Manila: for example, it is possible to drive to both ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Puerto Galera"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boracay"]]}," from Manila via the Western Nautical Highway.

Most signs conform to design guidelines used in the United States.\n\nFilipinos are famous for their driving habits (or lack thereof).  Traffic often grinds to a screeching halt, especially in major cities (Metro Manila in particular), and the honking of horns is a very common occurrence.  When there is no traffic, speeding, swerving and reckless passing happen on a regular basis, especially on desolate rural roads.  Car traffic competes with bus and jeepney traffic, which jostle sidewalk curbs to get more passengers, especially in areas without designated bus stops: the fact that bus and jeepney drivers' salaries are determined based on passenger load does not help the traffic situation in many cities.  Motorcycles frequently weave through traffic, increasing the risk of accidents.  However, traffic lights, while frequently ignored in the past, are more strictly adhered to now.  Seatbelts are mandatory only for persons in the front seat.\n\nDue to heavy traffic congestion, Metro Manila and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Baguio"]]}," have laws that restrict certain vehicles based on the day of the week and the ending number of your vehicle's license plate: this is officially called the Uniform Vehicular Volume Reduction Program (UVVRP), but it is simply known as \"number coding\" or, previously \"color coding\" (although it has nothing to do with the color of your vehicle).  The UVVRP works as follows:\n\n",{"type":"{|","value":[["center border=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" align=\"center\""],["|+",{"type":"'''","value":["Number Coding"]}],["!Day !!Plate number"],["|-"],["|Monday ||1, 2"],["|-"],["|Tuesday ||3, 4"],["|-"],["|Wednesday ||5, 6"],["|-"],["|Thursday ||7, 8"],["|-"],["|Friday ||9, 0"],["|-"],["|Weekends and Holidays ||No coding"]]},"\n\nCities that enforce the UVVRP prohibit cars from being driven between 7AM and 7PM on a certain weekday on most national (primary) and secondary roads, although the implementation varies: in Metro Manila (excluding ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Makati"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pasay"]]},"), a \"window\" exists between 10AM and 3PM where the scheme is not enforced, while in Baguio, the UVVRP is only enforced in the city center, and the scheme does not apply to the rest of the city.  In general however, the UVVRP does not apply to minor streets (mostly in residential areas), and those roads remain open to coded cars the whole day.

You can also call reputable Taxi companies that can arrange pickups and transfers as well as airport runs. \n\nWhen hailing a taxi in the cities, ensure the meter is on and pay the metered fare. A tip of 10 pesos is acceptable. Also, make sure you have small denomination banknotes, as the drivers often claim not to have change in an effort to obtain a larger tip! Please do have coins ready with you. Moreover, don't be surprised if drivers want to bypass the meter during rush hour.

This is better than hailing a cab because you can see the number of available taxis and their location via GPS.

While Filipino is an Austronesian language like Malay, Indonesian and Javanese, the language has been heavily influenced by other languages, most notably ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Spanish phrasebook"],["Spanish"]]},", during the Spanish colonial period, and to this day the language is dominated by Spanish loanwords. Hence, many Filipinos can understand a little Spanish, while Spanish speakers would also recognise many Filipino words. In addition, as Malay and Filipino are closely related, speakers of Malay would also recognise many cognates in the Filipino language.\n\nFilipino is the language spoken in the Central Luzon and Southern Tagalog regions as well as the National Capital Region (NCR) or Metro Manila.

However almost all broadsheet newspapers still use English. Tourists won't have problems using English when making inquiries from commercial and government establishments. A few simple phrases in Filipino will come in handy when traveling to rural places as English proficiency is limited there.

As such, it is a melange of Chinese, Malay, Spanish, European and American influences. Though its cuisine is not as renowned as many of its neighbours, such as that of Thailand and Vietnam, Filipino cooking is nonetheless distinct in that it is possibly the least spicy of all South East Asian cuisines. Don't make the mistake of thinking that Filipino food is bland, though. It is just that instead of spices, Filipino food depends more on garlic, onions and ginger to add flavor to dishes. Painstaking preparation and prolonged cooking time is also a characteristic of most Filipino dishes, and when done properly is often what brings out the flavor of the food as, opposed to a healthy dose of spices. \n\nThe limited use of spices, possibly due to US influence, has to an extent hobbled the cuisine and the current penchant for fast food militates against the \"painstaking preparations\" that were once the hallmark of the cuisine. There are small movements to revive traditional Filipino cuisine but they may not succeed on a larger scale for a couple of reasons:\n#They are too late. The corporations that drive the food and food processing market are way ahead of them and far too influential. They have won the battle of hearts and minds decades ago to the point that new babies each day are born thinking that the processed foods they are nourished on, and the magic monosodium glutamated spice mixes that flavor all their meals are actually examples of good food. Their exposure to real traditional cooking is likely to be extremely limited.\n#The pantry that makes up filpino cuisine is by now so small that no matter what dish gets created, it only has about 3 to 5 ingredients. This has to change and the \"old\" ingredients must be reclaimed like herbs, spices and so forth. They were in use centuries ago and were just as common as what is seen today in Thailand etc, but they were gradually removed from the diet by foreign influences. It is useless to cling to the idea that Filpino cuisine is anywhere on par with its neighbors. No one but Filipinos actually believe that! It is way behind and should seek to catch up, it must make changes on a national level. The influence of balikbayans is critical in this area as they have seen both sides of the story and have been more exposed to international cuisines. \n\n",{"type":"''","value":["Kamayan"]},", literally means Eating with Hands.

Almost all Filipinos in the urban areas though use spoons, forks and knives.

Some areas in the Visayas prefer corn but elsewhere Filipinos would generally have rice for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Uncooked rice usually comes in 50kg sacks but can be bought by the kilogram at the wet market or at neighborhood rice dealers.

Popular places include Makati (particularly the Glorietta and Greenbelt areas), Ortigas Metrowalk, and Eastwood in Libis. Other big cities such as Cebu City and Davao also have areas where the nightlife is centered. Establishments serve the usual hard and soft drinks typical of bars elsewhere. Note that Filipinos rarely consume alcohol by itself. They would normally have what is called as \"pulutan\" or bar chow alongside their drinks which is like the equivalent of tapas. At the least, this would consist of mixed nuts but selections of grilled meats and seafood are not uncommon food alongside the customary drinks. When having a party, Filipinos enjoy drinking round-robin style using a common glass. One is supposed to drink bottoms-up before passing the glass to the next person. This custom is known as \"tagayan\" and one person usually volunteers to pour the drink.\n\nBeer is perhaps the most common form of alcohol consumed in bars.

Text messages typically cost as low as ₱1 and the Philippines is usually tagged as the \"texting capital of the world\". International SMS is charged at a higher rate of between  ₱15-25.  Plans for unlimited call and SMS are offered by the networks are but are almost always restricted to those made to parties within the same network.  \n\nReloading (known in other countries as recharge\/recharging or top-up\/topping-up) pre-paid SIMs is a breeze. Electronic Load (E-Load) stations are everywhere from small corner stores to the large malls where you just give your mobile phone number and the amount you wish to load (Globe, Smart and Sun each have their load denominations to choose from for E-loading).  If you have a friend using the same mobile operator as you, you can load as little as a few pesos by letting him\/her pass on some of his\/her load to you and if you need hundreds of pesos worth of load, you can purchase pre-paid cards which are available in denominations of ₱100, ₱300 and ₱500.   \n\nDue to the wide use of mobile phones, pay phones are increasingly becoming obsolete.
