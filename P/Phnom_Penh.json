Things are improving, though roads remain shabby, traffic chaotic, and electricity strained.\n\nThe city is slowly gaining high rise buildings and traffic lights. The beauty that made it a \"Paris of the East\" before 1970 is unfortunately well hidden, though a few French colonial buildings remain. The wide boulevards and promenades envisaged by the French have become parking spaces and market stalls: pedestrians are not in favour.\n\nThe most pleasant strolling is to be done along the park-like river front, which hosts cafés and restaurants aplenty. Standard tourist sights are few, which makes the city a place to relax, watch the street life and absorb the local colour. Phnom Penh is a worthwhile destination for those who enjoy an \"edgy\" experience and can brave the downsides of reckless driving, noise, dust, and perennial theft.\n\nTouts and beggars abound. A firm but polite refusal should work. Older or disabled beggars will be happy to accept 500 riel. Bear in mind that anyone old enough to have survived the Khmer Rouge has had a tough life. Generosity here is no bad thing. Some older people may even invoke a blessing on you for your gift. Cocky young kids demanding a dollar should not be encouraged.\n\nThe weather is hot and humid, with showers in the late afternoon in the rainy season.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nIn 1975 Phnom Penh was choked with up to 2 million refugees from the war between the then US-backed government and the Khmer Rouge. The city fell to the Khmer Rouge in 1975, who completely emptied it of civilians and allowed it to crumble for several years. The city's small class of skilled or educated professionals was systematically murdered by Pol Pot, or driven into exile.\n\nCambodia's developing economy and institutionalised corruption have concentrated wealth into a new class of ",{"type":"''","value":["nouveau riche"]}," that now frequent Phnom Penh's new fancy hotels and restaurants.

If you are willing to lug your bags outside the airport fence you can catch a tuk-tuk into town for USD5. While taxis might be a safer option, it's better to avoid them as the drivers are arrogant and tend to not return change. Tuk-tuk drivers are a lot more friendly and more flexible. For visitors on a budget without a lot of luggage, it's worth catching an official motorcycle taxi for USD2.\n\nDuty free shop prices in Cambodia are horribly inflated. Alcohol and cigarettes cost half as much at shops and supermarkets in the city, like the Lucky Supermarket, so stock up on alcohol (put it in your checked baggage due to liquid restrictions for carry-on baggage) and cigarettes before you come to the airport. For example, 1 l of Absolut Vodka is USD21 at the airport, and USD11 at supermarkets in the city. Electronics are also overpriced (but at least they're the genuine article).

Women are the main targets. When riding in a tuk-tuk keep your bag toward the middle of the tuk-tuk to protect against bag snatching. When on a motorcycle taxi, keep your bag between you and the driver or in front of the driver. Do not carry\/wear your bag on your back!\n\nScammers and con men sometimes work the tourist areas such as the riverfront, Hun Sen Park and the Sorya Mall. A group of scammers operate around the riverside, targeting travellers. Their basic method is to start a conversation, make friends, claim to have a relative who is soon moving to your country of origin, and invite you to dinner at their house. Once you get there, they will apparently try to trick you into playing a rigged card game for money, and if that fails then they will give you stories about sick relatives and ask money for that instead.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\nAs in most developing world countries, avoiding cold, uncooked food is desirable to prevent stomach upsets.

A vendor should have an activated test card to be used to make sure your phone will operate on that network. Calls between mobile networks can be spotty and Skype calls from abroad to mobiles in Cambodia are sometimes dropped, so be prepared to redial frequently. SIM cards, phone credit and internet packages can be bought and activated at the airport located just after passing through customs. A great time and place to do so if you know you going to buy a local sim card in Cambodia. Its a good idea to have your phone sim unlocked before leaving home. It seems all phones sold in Cambodia are unlocked. Dual sim phones are cheaply available which are useful for travellers who want to use their home sim card and a local sim card at the same time.\n\nMobitel and metfone have the best coverage around the whole of Cambodia. Metfone is particularly good for their internet packages (e.g. 2.5Gb for one month for $5) and they allow hotspot tethering from you smart phone unlike Mobitel. Useful if you use a laptop a lot and want to use wifi via your hotspot enabled smart phone such as any recent mid or high range Android phone or iPhone 4 and above.\n\nMost of the major networks such as metfone have kiosks at the Phnom Penh airport located just after walking through customs. This is a great opportunity to buy your local sim card, some credit and perhaps an Internet data package. If so, check that it all appears to be operating OK before heading off, such as by loading up a web page and checking your balance.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Internet "]},"\nWi-Fi is available in most of the hotels that welcome Western tourists and backpackers.
