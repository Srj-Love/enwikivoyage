The answer is, surprisingly, agriculture. The Salt and Verde Rivers of central Arizona were exploited for large-scale agriculture by Native Americans as early as the 11th century. The area that now encompasses Phoenix was a center of the Hohokam culture, which built large canal systems and a network of towns and villages, whose remains may be viewed in the city to this day. White settlers discovered the remnants of the Hohokam culture in the 19th century. The city's name reflects its history as a city \"reborn from the ashes\" of the previous settlement.\n\nEuropean-American settlement of the area commenced in the 1860s, and in 1911 the completion of the first of several large reservoirs in the mountains north and east of Phoenix insured its success as a center for irrigation-based agriculture. Many tens of thousands of acres were planted in citrus and cotton and other crops, and for many years, intensive, year-round irrigated agriculture formed the basis of the economy.  Recent years are seeing a revival, and trendy hotels, bars, shops and restaurants are making it a place to be again.\n\nWarm and sunny winter weather also ensured a thriving tourism industry, and encouraged many Easterners and Midwesterners to relocate to Phoenix. High-tech industry began to flourish after World War II, and since that time the growth of Phoenix has been explosive.  As a result, a population of just over 100,000 in 1950 has given way to a 2006 estimate of 1,512,986 (with the metro area estimated at 4,039,182)",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.census.gov\/population\/www\/estimates\/metro_general\/2006\/CBSA-EST2006-01.csv"]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Imperial"],["janhigh =   65"],["febhigh =   69"],["marhigh =   74"],["aprhigh =   83"],["mayhigh =   92"],["junhigh =   102"],["julhigh =   104"],["aughigh =   102"],["sephigh =   97"],["octhigh =   86"],["novhigh =   73"],["dechigh =   65"],["janlow =   43"],["feblow =   47"],["marlow =   51"],["aprlow =   58"],["maylow =   66"],["junlow =   75"],["jullow =   81"],["auglow =   80"],["seplow =   75"],["octlow =   63"],["novlow =   50"],["declow =   44"],["janprecip =  0.8"],["febprecip =  0.8"],["marprecip =  1.1"],["aprprecip =  0.3"],["mayprecip =  0.2"],["junprecip =  0.1"],["julprecip =  1.0"],["augprecip =  0.9"],["sepprecip =  0.8"],["octprecip =  0.8"],["novprecip =  0.7"],["decprecip =  0.9"],["description = ",{"type":"{{","value":[["ForecastNOAA"],["Phoenix"],["33.45"],["-112.07"]]}]]},"\n\nPhoenix has an arid climate with long, hot summers and very mild winters.

Do not tell them you are flying in. That way you are a \"local rental\" and do not have to pay some of the surcharges that are automatic if you rent at the car rental building at the airport. The surcharges finance everything from the local jails to the new Cardinals Stadium.

However, if you plan to stick to the Tempe-Downtown Phoenix area, the Light Rail is a viable option, with an all-day adult pass running roughly $3.50.  Taxis are typically fairly easy to find in proximity to major Light-Rail stops and in popular areas, and will run you from $10-15 for a fairly local trip to well over $100 for a ride to a distant suburb.\n\nSurface roads are usually easy to navigate. The area's roads are designed around a grid system, where most roads are numbered based on their distance from the city center. Addresses also conform to the numbering of the roads around them.  Nearly all streets run with the compass directions, and there's a major thoroughfare every mile in each direction.  This also applies to the extended metro area, though addresses in places like Tempe and Mesa are not based on downtown Phoenix.\n\nThere is an extensive network of freeways, most built since 1987. Note: Heavy construction on some segments and interchanges continues. Check construction schedules and closures in the local media.\n\nDrinking and driving laws are very heavily enforced in Phoenix, especially in Scottsdale and Tempe. Harsh DUI laws & police traps ensure you will most likely be pulled over during peak bar hours 11PM-2:30AM.

Some parts of the city (and even a few parts of some of the suburbs) should be avoided at night.  Downtown Phoenix is safe during the day, but does have a problem with the homeless\/transients, some of whom approach well-dressed office workers and tourists asking for spare change. South Phoenix can be unsafe in some areas.\n\nMaryvale, a commercial\/residential district on the west side of the city of Phoenix (extending north into Glendale as well), should be avoided at almost all times unless there is a specific reason to go there.\n\nMost of the suburban areas are safe during day and night; however, parts of Mesa and Glendale can be dangerous at night. Some portions of Tempe, near the main campus of Arizona State University (ASU), have seen assaults in the recent past on a few university students. The ASU campus is equipped with several emergency call boxes.\n\nThe Sunnyslope area (north central city of Phoenix) has some homeless and other crime issues but a new police station was recently built at Peoria and 7th Ave which has dramatically reduced crime.\n\nThe town of Guadalupe (immediately west of Tempe and bounded by Interstate 10 on the west) is unsafe at night, but is an incredibly interesting Hispanic\/Native American community to visit during the day. Be warned though that the speed limit suddenly falls from 40mph to 25mph as you enter the town.\n\nIn every portion of the Phoenix area, just use common sense and be aware of your surroundings.\n\nPhoenix also has one of the highest car theft rates in the country, with a car stolen every 7 minutes. In addition, red light running is more common in Phoenix than any other city in the U.S. Use caution at every turn.\n\nSpeeding, tailgating and aggressive driving are common on the freeways.\n\nBe aware of traffic and speed enforcement cameras at most major intersections.  Always anticipate someone attempting to beat the amber light before it turns red to avoid being issued a very expensive traffic ticket (usually in the amount of $300 or more). If you see sudden braking, make sure you're going the speed limit. Sometimes, camera vans are set up on the side of the road to snatch speeders, especially in the Northeastern parts of the Valley.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Newspapers"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=The Arizona Republic"],["url=http:\/\/www.azcentral.com"],["email="],["address=200 E Van Buren St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 602 444-8000"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=The city’s main newspaper that is read throughout the city and state."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=La Voz"],["url=http:\/\/www.azcentral.com\/lavoz"],["email="],["address=200 E Van Buren St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 602 444-8000"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=A popular Spanish language newspaper published by The Arizona Republic."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=The New Times"],["url=http:\/\/www.phoenixnewtimes.com"],["email="],["address=1201 E Jefferson"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 602 271-0040"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Independent news and information about events, music, food, published under common ownership with New York's Village Voice."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=East Valley Tribune"],["alt=(formerly the Mesa Tribune)"],["url=http:\/\/www.eastvalleytribune.com\/"],["email="],["address=1620 W.
