The long winding main street of Phonsavan looks like the setting of a David Lynch-inspired spaghetti western minus the tumbleweeds. As soon as you leave town the countryside is dominated by green hills and pine forests. Villages consist of colourful wooden houses. Ranching is the primary occupation. You will see more than one Hmong cowboy with brown and violet cowboy hats. During Hmong New Year there are even bullfights in Phonsavan.\n\nThe best-known tourist attraction is the nearby ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Plain of Jars"]]},", which is to be nominated for UNESCO World Heritage status. The main economic activities in Phonsavan are governmental administration, mining companies from China and Australia, tourism and the work of NGOs clearing unexploded ordnance (UXO).\n\nPhonsavan is home to various ethnic groups, such as the Phuan, whose ancestors once founded the kingdom of the same name; the Hmong, whose New Year's celebrations in Xieng Khouang are famous throughout Laos; the Khmu, and the Tai Dam. There is also a minority of Laotian Chinese and Vietnamese, as well as some international workers and missionaries from Korea and Western countries. Typical local products are natural dyes and textiles, each with an individual pattern depending on the ethnic group, basketry, mulberry paper umbrellas, spoons made from war scrap or embroidery.\n\nFor general information visit the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Provincial Tourism Department"]}," near the market, Thalat Nam Ngum, on the road to the airport. xkgtourism@yahoo.com.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nPhonsavan's ",{"type":"'''","value":["Xiang Khouang Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["XKH"]]},") has 4 flights per week to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vientiane"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Lao Airlines"]}," offers six flights a week in peak season and four flights in low season.
