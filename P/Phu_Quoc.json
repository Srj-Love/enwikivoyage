It is 48 km in length from south to north and has a population of approximately 80,000 people. In the Gulf of Thailand 45 km west of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ha Tien"]]}," on the Vietnamese mainland and 15 km south of the coast of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cambodia"]]},", Phú Quôc is ringed with some of most beautiful beaches in Vietnam, and offers the best seafood in the country.\n\nPhú Quôc Island served as a base for French missionary Pigneau de Behaine from the 1760-80s and at one time he provided shelter here for Prince Nguyen Anh (later Emperor Gia Long) when he was being hunted by the Tay Son rebels. During the Vietnam War there was little fighting here but the island was used by the ARVN as a prison for captured Viet Cong.\n \nPhú Quôc is not really part of the Mekong delta and also doesn’t share the delta's extraordinary ability to produce rice and fruit due to the low quality of its soil and inaccessible terrain. It is, however, home to the best fish sauce (nuoc mam) in the world, and is also reputed to produce high quality pepper and fantastic seafood. \n\nAnother point of interest in Phú Quôc is the island's native dog. This dog was originally a wild animal and later trained as a hunting dog by local people. These days they are very domesticated and it's unusual to go anywhere on the island without seeing one. These animals have unusually sharp teeth (as they tear their food when they eat it rather than bite) and have claws that over the years have been optimised for catching prey and are razor sharp.\n\nPhú Quôc is what Phuket was before it was overrun by development. Phú Quôc Island and its beaches were voted \"The Cleanest and Most Beautiful Beach in the World\" by ABC News in Feb 2008. However, this is changing fast. Insiders call the island \"the world's first rubbish dump on which tourism is run\" or \"the island, where nature and rubbish grow together\" because of the excessive pollution (mainly plastic bags) outside the tourist resorts.\n  \nThere are extensive plans to develop Phú Quôc, including high-rise residential areas, several new towns and suburbs, complete rebuilding of Duong Dông' city centre, and replacing the existing small PQC airport. The new international airport south of Duong Dông opened in early-2013.
