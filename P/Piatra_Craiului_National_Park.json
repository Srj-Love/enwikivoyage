Always carry a stick for protection and some stones in the pocket. Shepherd know their dogs and usually react quickly. Better is to circumvent the flog.\n\nEspecially in spring wild pigs will attack when accompanied by small ones and suddenly encountered. Be careful on open fields. Get into a tree when being attacked. By the way: normally they will get away when people are approaching. As do bears. Making some noise when walking could be a good idea.\n\nDo not walk in the forest during the night.\n\nBe aware for thunderstorms on the ridge. Lightning strikes often here and there are not many ways to descent.\nThe shelters on the Piatra Craiului ridge are said to be save when trapped on the ridge in lightning. One shelter is near the summit \"la Om\" on the ridge.\n\nTake enough water from the few springs at the foot of the mountain before ascending. No water can be found on the ridge and the way is long. Ask locals for locations of springs. On some trails they can hardly be found.\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Brașov County‎"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinepark"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Piatra Craiului Mountains"]]}]
