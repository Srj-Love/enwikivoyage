Sydney is sprawling to the south-west and west, and Picton is already at the edge of the commuter belt for Sydney.  But the town centre of Picton is still charming, with a creek running through the town to the south, and a selection of shops along the main street, good coffee from a choice of cafes.  It is the kind of village look that crafty tourist towns of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Berry"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bowral"]]}," try to capture, but it is here at the centre of a real local community in Picton.  Get off the Hume Highway, and drop in to Picton for a coffee and a wander.  If you miss it this time, next time you're passing it may just be another Sydney suburb with a strip mall on the outskirts.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Picton Viaduct 1991.jpg"],["right"],["thumb"],["300px"],["The historic railway viaduct is still in use"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car "]},"\n\nPicton is around 10km diversion from the Hume Highway heading south-west from Sydney.

Full licence training also available.  There is a cafe with a decent coffee machine and toasted sandwiches at a reasonable price if you just want to watch. Or if your idea of lunch is a pack of corn chips with a tin of bean mix and cheese for around $8, they can help you with that too.  Picnic tables if you'd rather bring your own.  Entry is free, $275 for a tandem skydive.  Discounts available for a second jump on the same day.  Pick a time online, but usually it is okay to just drop in.
