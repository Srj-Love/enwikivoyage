You'll get a great view of it from across the river in Ft. Pierre.  Take a tour and see the interior as well, from the hand-laid mosaic tiles on the floor to the intricate paintings on the dome. The sculptures outside are also worth a look.  The Fighting Stallions out front might not be your style, but the energy they represent is clear.  The memorial statues of soldiers out near Capitol Lake are also impressive.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=US 14.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["directionl1=W"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rapid City"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wall (South Dakota)"],["Wall"]]}],["directionr1=E"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brookings (South Dakota)"],["Brookings"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Miller"]]}],["image2=US 83.svg"],["imagesize2=22"],["directionl2=N"],["majorl2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bismarck"]]}],["minorl2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Selby (South Dakota)"],["Selby"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["lfarrow"]]}," Jct ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:US 212.svg"],["18px"]]}],["directionr2=S"],["majorr2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Platte"]]}],["minorr2=Jct ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kadoka"],["W"]]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:I-90.svg"],["18px"]]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oacoma"],["E"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["rtarrow"]]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mission (South Dakota)"],["Mission"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["44.36833"],["-100.35083"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Great Lakes (South Dakota)"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Pierre, South Dakota"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North_America\/United_States\/South_Dakota\/Localities\/P\/Pierre\/"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Pierre, South Dakota"]]}]
