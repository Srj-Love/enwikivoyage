The capital of Kwazulu-Natal, it is famous for its history and architecture.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nAccess to Pietermaritzburg by road is easy, lying as it does on the major N3 freeway from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Durban"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Johannesburg"]]},". The R56 connects Pietermaritzburg with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cape Town"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Port Elizabeth"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["East London"]]}," to the south-west.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.spoornet.co.za\/ShosholozaMeyl Spoornet"]}," operates regular inter-city trains to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Durban"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Johannesburg"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bloemfontein"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kimberley (South Africa)"],["Kimberley"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cape Town"]]},".\n\nThe train station is on the corner of Church and Railway streets, on the south-west edge of the city centre.

The bus station is located in Burger Street, opposite the McDonalds and it serves major bus companies. Grey Hound is the most reliable and it operates several round-trips from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Durban"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Johannesburg"]]}," daily, where Pietermaritzburg is the last stop before ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Durban"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nPrivate transport is the best way of getting around. Car rental is strongly advised. Otherise, minibus-taxis are cheap but uncomfortable and occasionally unsafe. Some of the sights of Pietermaritzburg are within walking distance, if you don't mind trudging along for a few kilometres. Private taxis (cabs) can also be hired, but they are substantially more expensive than the minibus-taxis. \n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Yellow Cab company"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+27 (0)33 397-1910"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\nThe central minibus-taxi rank is in Market Square, which is in the Central Business District near the Natal Society Library and the City Hall.\n\nTo get to the Central Business District from any of the suburbs by minibus-taxi, look for a taxi that is travelling to \"eTuwen\" or simply \"Town\". (There should be a guy leaning out the window announcing this loudly).\n\nYou don't want to go to eThekwini, which is Durban. You want to go to *town*. Ask the conductor if you're unsure.\n\nMinibus-taxis have set routes, so there are a lot of places you can't get to using them.\n\nThe CBD isn't as safe as the suburbs. The area around the City Hall is pretty good, but I'd advise against long rambling walks into unfamiliar parts of it.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nThe City Hall, which is in the CBD, is the largest red brick building in the Southern Hemisphere. It contains a large organ, and occasionally hosts concerts.\n\nThe ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.tatham.org.za\/ Tatham Art Gallery"]}," across the road houses some fine artwork, including an impressive and ornate clock on the second floor. You'll find a coffee shop on the second floor. Entrance is free.\n\nThe Natal Society Library is behind the City Hall, and has recently undergone substantial revamping, with a large new children's wing being built. The fountain and the square that it stands in is scheduled for major renovation.\n\nDown the road you can find the Voortrekker Museum, which celebrates the Great Trek by the Afrikaner people into the interior of South Africa.\n\nFurther afield, Queen Elizabeth Park up on the hills above the city contains zebra, buck and the like. No leopards or dangerous creatures, so you can walk around and enjoy the park on foot. Make sure you don't get your food stolen by monkeys, though.\n\nThe KwaZulu-Natal National Botanical Gardens in Mayor's Walk are spectacular and worth an extended visit. The gardens focus on indigenous flora and offer diverse walks through forests and open ground. A restaurant and coffee shop is located at the entrance. Weekend visitors will witness a stream of wedding parties going to the gardens to have their photos taken.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nThe nightlife in Pietermaritzburg is pretty limited. Two or three clubs dominate the scene. Crowded House (in the CBD, fairly near to the City Hall) is one of the most popular, playing pop and dance music. Exclusive Lounge nearby plays kwaito and house music. Franki Bananaz is a cocktail bar in Armitage Road that is popular with the twenties set. For a more alternative scene, The Red Door in Quarry Road (off Victoria Road) plays alternative rock\/punk music on Friday nights. Live folk and rock music can be heard at the Red Door on Tuesdays and Saturdays.\n\nPietermaritzburg does offer quite a couple of pubs and sports clubs. The Stagecoach which is situated near the University has a lovely pub atmosphere.\n\nCaffe Vacca Matta at the Golden Horse Casino (in Scottsville) has a more upmarket pitch. Serving as a restaurant in the afternoon and early evening, it becomes a nightclub later on. Dress tends to be slightly more formal, with collared shirts, no jeans or takkies, and the like. Also be aware that the minimum age at Vacca Matta varies, so phone in advance.\n\nEvery year in May the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.comrades.com Comrades Marathon"]}," is held (in 2010 on the 30th).
