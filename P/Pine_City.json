In recent years, the rural feel of the community has diminished some giving way to exurbia pushing outward from the Twin Cities. That said, Pine City has held true to its sense of place and community and doesn't at all feel swallowed up by its large metropolitan neighbors to the south. Pine City rests easily in the shadow of Minneapolis-St. Paul, sufficiently close for a quick side trip, sufficiently distant to enjoy a more tranquil existence.\n\nPine City is like an image that lingers in the American consciousness: an oak-lined courthouse square. Gazebos and band shells. One-chair barber shops. The town café, gossip for breakfast and meatloaf for lunch. It's small-town, downtown life, as it was and as it remains.\n\nThe city's politics are split between liberal and conservative with a slight advantage to the liberals. Carhardt is a popular brand worn on local, middle-aged men and its not uncommon to see fishing hooks attached to many of their hat bills. The typical Pine Citian says \"You bet\" in place of \"yes\". Yet, this is a place that mixes the true 'Up North' with a surprising level of sophistication; after all, it's an arts community. \n\nWhile it's the biggest city around it for miles--from North Branch to Cloquet, and from Mora to Rice Lake, Wis. (a very large geographic area)--it's not a pious place and the people aren't pretentious. They show a fine display of \"Minnesota Nice\" and are eager to assist the tourist. To get a deeper understanding of the city, one has to visit it.\n \n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = F"],["janhigh = 21"],["febhigh = 27"],["marhigh = 38"],["aprhigh = 54"],["mayhigh = 67"],["junhigh = 75"],["julhigh = 80"],["aughigh = 78"],["sephigh = 69"],["octhigh = 55"],["novhigh = 39"],["dechigh = 25"],["janlow =4"],["feblow =17"],["marlow =30"],["aprlow =40"],["maylow =51"],["junlow =56"],["jullow =56"],["auglow =53"],["seplow =43"],["octlow =32"],["novlow =21"],["declow =6"],["janprecip =0.9"],["febprecip =0.9"],["marprecip =1.6"],["aprprecip =2.8"],["mayprecip =3.4"],["junprecip =4.5"],["julprecip =4.1"],["augprecip =4.1"],["sepprecip =3.8"],["octprecip =3.2"],["novprecip =1.8"],["decprecip =1.2"],["description = ",{"type":"{{","value":[["ForecastNOAA"],["Pine City"],["45.83"],["-92.96"]]}]]},"\n\nThe weather is definitely not one of the attractions in Pine City.

May and September are pleasant and mild; April and June are mostly fine, although thunderstorms with heavy winds can also occur suddenly. Even though there may be a chill in the air in October, it rarely calls for more than a light coat.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Read"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"''","value":["Cordes, Jim"]}," (1989).
