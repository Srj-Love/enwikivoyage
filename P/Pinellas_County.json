Though still referred to as an island, Hurricane Elena filled Dunedin Pass in 1985, making Caladesi Island accessible by walking north from North Clearwater Beach."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Skyway Fishing Pier State Park"]}," is a Florida State Park located on the north and south sides of the mouth of Tampa Bay.
