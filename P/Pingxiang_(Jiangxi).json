[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Mena-asia_default_banner.jpg"],["pgname=Pingxiang"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Pingxiang "]}," is a city in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jiangxi Province"]]},", China.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.pingxiang.gov.cn\/en\/ Pingxiang (萍乡市)"]}]}," (lit. \"duckweed village\") is located on the west edge of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jiangxi Province"]]},", bordering Hunan Province.  Although it is called a \"city\" (\"市\"), it is not equivalent to the western concept of a \"city\" (i.e. a continuous urban developed area).  Pingxiang has a total area of 1,478 square miles. It has a population of 1.8 million (2006 figure), of which only a quarter lives in the urban area.  It is primarily a commercial and transportation hub.\n\nAdministratively, it is comprised of 2 urban districts (Anyuan (安源区) in the middle, Xiangdong (湘东区) to the west), and 3 counties (Lianhua (莲花县) to the south, Shangli (上栗县) to the north, Luxi (芦溪县) to the east).  Confusingly, Xiangdong, although called a district (\"区\"), is physically about the same area as the counties (\"县\").\n\nBy far the largest urban area (\"城区\") is located in Anyuan district, although the Anyuan district is much larger than the urban area.  Unless otherwise noted, all attractions are in the Anyuan urban district.\n\nPingxiang has historically not been much of a tourist destination.  They are actively trying to change that, focusing on the natural beauty, the events that occurred here important to early CCP history, and minority culture.  However, they are still in the early stages of this process, so travelers should keep that in mind (e.g. minimal English is spoken).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Plane"]},"\n\nPingxiang has no airport with regularly scheduled flights.

Nearly all of these, however, are the slower \"T\" or \"K\" trains, so you probably don't want to take the train from, say, Beijing (unless you're looking for a true Chinese train experience).  There are \"D\" trains between Pingxiang and Shanghai (one train per day in each direction), which takes one between Pingxiang and Shanghai in about 8 hours (vs about 13 hours on the \"K\" train).  There are currently no high-speed (\"G\" or \"C\" class) trains into Pingxiang.\n\nAlternatively, Changsha is on the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Wuhan–Guangzhou High-Speed Railway"]},".  Note that the high-speed rail station is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Changsha South Railway Station"]}," (长沙南站)(located about 10 km east of the city center), while trains from Changsha to Pingxiang stop at the Changsha Railway Station (located at city center).
