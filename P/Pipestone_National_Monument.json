Unfortunately, exotic species such as Kentucky bluegrass and smooth brome also are present.\n\nPipestone's remnant tallgrass prairies host many plants and animals that once flourished throughout the midwest. Over five hundred plant species, twenty-five fish species, forty-five macroinvertebrate species, eight reptiles and amphibians, twenty five mammal species, fifty-five families of insects (over nine hundred specimens have been collected), and approximately one hundred bird species are currently found at the Monument.  Two species listed under the Endangered Species Act are found at Pipestone National Monument: the Topeka shiner (fish) and the Western Prairie Fringed Orchid (plant).\n\nMany people are surprised to encounter cactus in Minnesota, but the Prickly Pear Cactus is present at Pipestone National Monument, as it is in several other locations in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southwestern Minnesota."]]},"  Other areas where one might find cactus in Minnesota include ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Blue Devil Valley State Park"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Blue Mounds State Park"]]},".
