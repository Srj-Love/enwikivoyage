Only fifteen casks are produced each week. They have a paid tour (£7.50) which includes two drams (at the beginning of the tour, not at the end as in most other distilleries).\n:The stills are the smallest in use of any distillery in Scotland. Were they any smaller, they would be deemed by HM Revenue and Customs to be portable, with the implicit capacity for illegal production.\n:There is a variety of whiskies available from the distillery. Most are chill-filtered, a process by which the esters and oils are removed, producing a cleaner look to the whisky, which when chilled or has ice added to it does not turn cloudy. There is also a non-chill-filtered 12-year-old malt, some of which goes into the \"House of Lords\" and \"Clan Campbell\" blends.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["buy"],["name=House of Bruar"],["url=http:\/\/www.houseofbruar.com\/scotland-clothing\/pitlochry.html"],["email="],["address=By Blair Atholl, PH18 5TZ"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Follow the A9 north past Blair Atholl"],["phone = +44 1796 483236"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Located ten miles north of Pitlochry on the A9, the Falls of Bruar are a spectacular series of pools and waterfalls that are well worth a look if you're visiting the House of Bruar.
