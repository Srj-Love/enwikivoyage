Every October thousands of pilgrims walk from as far as Lima and Ecuador to adore this miraculously created image of Jesus, which allegedly was carved by artisans who disappeared from a sealed room after completing the figure, accepting no payment.  Ayabaca is also close to Bosque de Cuyas, one of the most accessible remnants of cloud forest on the western slopes of the Andes.  To see the forest, which hosts over 140 species of birds in a mere 600 hectares, it is best to employ a guide for S\/12 per day from the village of Yacupampa, about 5 minutes from Ayabaca in mototaxi.  Lodging can be had in several hotels (S\/15 - S\/30 per night) around the main plaza in Ayabaca.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["-5.2000"],["-80.6333"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Northern Coast (Peru)"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Piura"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/South_America\/Peru\/Departments\/Piura\/Piura\/"]]}]
