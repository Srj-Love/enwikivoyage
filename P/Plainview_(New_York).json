The remaining land was purchased in 1695 in a deal called the Bethpage Purchase. When the Long Island Railroad was built, Plainview had an increase in the farming market.\n\nAfter World War II, many people were trying to leave New York for a more rural area. People moving out of the city resulted in many of the farmers in Plainview to sell their land. Massive development in the area began to take place and turned Plainview into the suburban town that it is now. The population jumped in size, making Plainview change from farmland to a functioning town.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Climate"]},"\nPlainview has a continental climate with four distinct seasons.
