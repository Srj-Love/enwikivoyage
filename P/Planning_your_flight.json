An e-ticket is an electronic record of your booking details which is stored in the airline's computers; you will not receive a paper ticket, which consists of a booklet of flight coupons.  In most cases, an itinerary receipt containing your flight details is prepared and e-mailed or printed for your reference.  The itinerary receipt contains a unique six-character ",{"type":"'''","value":["Passenger Name Record"]}," (PNR), which is used to identify your booking.\n\nWhile an e-ticket itinerary receipt has a lot of the features of a basic itinerary, it has added features such as a ticket number, baggage allowance, computation of the fare and surcharges, mode of payment, etc.  It also comes with the conditions of carriage which includes your rights in case something happens to the flights you are booked with.  \n\nIn theory, an e-ticket allows you to just show a valid ID upon check-in, as your name is all the agent needs to access your flight details.  However, for security reasons, some airports require you to show a print-out of the itinerary receipt as proof of your booking before entering the airport and\/or upon check-in.  In addition, when travelling to another country, immigration authorities often require proof of onward or return travel.  So always bring a print-out of the itinerary receipt with you for easy reference.\n\nDue to concerns of credit card fraud, when you purchase e-tickets over the Internet with a credit card, some carriers require you to ",{"type":"'''","value":["show the credit card"]}," used to purchase the tickets at the airport or their ticketing office for verification.  Take note of this especially if the credit card holder is not part of the travelling party - they need to see the credit card, not the authorised signature of the credit card holder.  Failure to do so may lead to re-issue of the ticket with the same (or higher) fare, and refund for the original ticket after many weeks or even months (if refundable; refund fees may apply).  \n\nIn the rare event that you are issued with a paper ticket, you ",{"type":"'''","value":["must"]}," present it when checking in for your flight. Look after your ticket; you cannot check in without it. If you lose the ticket, expect a lot of paperwork and\/or hassles: you may be required to buy another ticket for the flight and have to apply for a refund later, or pay a re-ticketing fee.  Not to mention that some jurisdictions will require you to file a police report.  Hence if you're afraid of losing or forgetting your paper ticket, request for an e-ticket whenever possible.  When you lose or misplace a print-out of the itinerary receipt, you can always freely and easily print another copy out from your email or request the carrier\/travel agent to email it to you again.\n\nThe major advantage of an ",{"type":"'''","value":["electronic ticket"]}," (e-ticket) is that because your flight details are in the airline's computers, the e-ticket can't get lost, forgotten, or stolen.  Your travel plans can also be altered without the need to print and deliver a new ticket.  If your airline offers online or self-service kiosk check-in, you can use these to print boarding passes, thus saving time at the airport.\n\nThe major disadvantage is that your flight details are in one specific airline's computers, so other airlines cannot access them.

This saves time at your destination because you don't have to wait to claim your checked luggage, and certainly carry-on luggage is less prone to getting lost or stolen. It might also save you money because many airlines charge a fee for each checked bag.  Check with your airline to make sure that your bag fits within their size\/weight restrictions for carry-ons, and whether your purse or laptop counts toward the limit of how many bags you can carry (or see the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["List of airline baggage limits"]]}," to help you compare airlines).  Also, with tight security restrictions on what kinds of items you can take with you into the passenger compartment (particularly nothing that could be used as a weapon and liquids in anything except small bottles), a carry-on-only strategy may not be practical so it is also useful to check the airport which you will departing out of to see restrictions in addition to the ones implemented by the airline you will be using. It is worthwhile to carry all critical items in the carry-on luggage, such as underwear, extra clothes, toothbrush etc.\n\nIf you want to travel with carry-on only but also have luggage that should be checked-in, you can use a company that provides a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["luggage delivery service"]]},".  Alternatively, you can use a wardrobe management company like ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.travelercloset.com The Traveler's Closet"]}," that not only stores and ships your luggage belongings, but provides you with a database to 'virtually pack' your items, and cleans them for you between trips. You can even arrange to have clean pressed apparel awaiting your arrival.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Pre-flight checks"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Reconfirming your flight"]},"\nIn general, it is ",{"type":"'''","value":["no longer necessary"]}," to call the airline to reconfirm flights, as reservation systems are fairly reliable.  Instead, just check the reservation online (see the next section) and call the airline only if there are problems.\n\nThe main exceptions are when you are flying way off the beaten track on an airline that doesn't (or looks like it doesn't!) do computerized reservations, especially when there won't be another flight for a week.  Off the beaten track in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Indonesia"]]},", for example, it's wise to reconfirm not just once but twice — although you may still get bumped off if a VIP and his harem show up at the last minute.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Checking your reservation"]},"\nIt's always good to double-check that your itinerary is still correct before you fly.  Not only can you check that everything is order, but also you can see whether any waitlists have cleared, flight times have changed, your special requests are properly recorded, etc. Most major airlines offer several convenient routes for checking, such as website, smartphone app, and telephone. Check in good time, as in case of flight cancellation or overbooking an earlier flight may still be available. If your carrier makes any changes to the itinerary they or your agent will try to contact you but they may not reach you in time. There are a number of online services that allow you to check reservations; however, you'll have to figure out which reservation system was used to do the booking.  This is usually printed at the top of your itinerary, but if all else fails you can always ask the agent.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.virtuallythere.com Abacus\/Sabre"]}]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.checkmytrip.com Amadeus"]}]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.viewtrip.com Apollo\/Galileo"]}]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" Though ",{"type":"'''","value":["Worldspan"]}," also offers such information, it now is accessible only to those with a valid Worldspan server installation, and ready to use ID and GDS for sign-on."]},"\nLow-cost carrier flights often will not show up in these systems.\n\nIn cases of terrible weather (e.g. blizzard, fog) or recent airport closures, get in touch with your airline before you leave home to see if your flight will push through as scheduled or if it is delayed or cancelled.  If your flight is cancelled and you have been put on the waitlist for a future flight, don't come to the airport until you have received confirmation from the airline that you will be able to fly on the flight for which you are waitlisted.

They usually open at least 24 hours before your scheduled flight.  By checking-in online, you can select your preferred seat in advance, quote your frequent flyer number for mileage accrual, and inform the airline how many bags you are intending to check-in thus saving time at the airport.  Furthermore, everybody else who is part of your traveling party can also be checked-in along with you.   \n\nOnline check-in procedures, features, benefits and requirements vary per airline and possibly per airport of departure.  For instance, some airlines may offer only online check-in and only if you are departing from certain airports so be sure to check with your airline if online check-in is available from your departure airport.  In relation to that, some airlines will allow the printing of a boarding pass at home while other airlines will still require passengers to claim it at the airport.  Another example is that for some airlines such as Southwest that do not assign seats, passengers are allowed to board earlier if they have checked-in in advance.  Also, some airlines will make this option available only to electronic ticket holders while others will invite paper ticket holders to take advantage of this option as well.      \n\nIf your airline does not let you print your boarding pass from where you are, be ready to note down or print all the other pertinent information given to you at the end of the online check-in process as they will be used to facilitate the rest of the check-in process at the airport.\n\nThe airline will usually provide a special lane for those who checked-in online; be sure to use it for faster service.\n\nDon't know where to print your boarding pass? An emerging trend in the issuance of boarding passes is having electronic boarding pass.  Some airlines such as American Airlines, Air Canada and KLM already offer this service to passengers flying selected routes.  All you need is a WAP or WiFi-enabled mobile device (such as a Blackberry, iPhone, iTouch) and depending on the airline's system, you can check-in online or via your mobile device.  You will receive a link to your electronic boarding pass or sometimes the boarding pass itself via SMS, MMS or e-mail on your mobile device (consult your mobile device manual on how to save SMS, emails).  The boarding pass will contain a barcode which will be scanned at the checkpoints and gate.  If you are on a \"domestic\" flight, you will only need to bring the mobile device containing the boarding pass in addition to your ID as required documents. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Other remote check-in methods"]},"\nSome airlines and stations also offer alternative ways to check-in.  Singapore Airlines for instance will allow you to check-in via self-service kiosk, SMS, mobile phone application or at Marina Bay Sands.  Lufthansa also offers SMS check-in.  If you use a kiosk, you can either manually input information, swipe your cards or scan the 2D barcode located in your printout or sent to your mobile phone for faster check-in.\n\nIf you are departing out of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong"]]}," and taking the MTR Airport Express train, you can enjoy the convenience of a typical check-in (see the Checking In section) at the Hong Kong or Kowloon station.  However, you will need to have already purchased an Airport Express ticket to enter the check-in area as there are faregates used for entry.  Once you are done, you can just take the train and proceed directly to passport control upon arrival at the airport.  This is very useful if you still have a lot of things to do in downtown Hong Kong but don't want to worry about carrying and transporting your luggage by yourself to the airport or leaving them somewhere. A similar system exists in Kuala Lumpur, with the KLIA Ekspres train leaving from KL Sentral Station.\n\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["ombox"],["type=custom"],["image=",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:BSicon FLUG.svg"],["link=Flying"],["30px"]]}],["text=<span style=\"color:black\"> Done?
