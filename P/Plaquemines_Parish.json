The area's development started in Louisiana's French and Spanish Colonial eras, taking advantage of the rich agricultural land along the narrow strips near the river, and the rich fishing in the wetlands and Gulf beyond.\n\nIn 2005 Hurricane Katrina hit the area. Belle Chasse was moderately damaged; in most of the rest of the Parish damage was severe to catastrophic, with storm surge sweeping over the levees, and smashing or sweeping away the majority of the buildings.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Orientation"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Eastbank"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Plaquemines Courthouse March 2012.jpg"],["right"],["thumb"],["Plaquemines Parish Courthouse, Pointe à la Hache"]]},"\nThe East Bank is on the same side of the river as most of New Orleans and as Chalmette. It is less populated than Plaquemines' West Bank. Highway 39 follows the River down the Eastbank; it connects to St. Bernard Highway (46) in St. Bernard Parish.\n\nNote that the gas station at Scarsdale, at the intersection of 39 & 3137 across from the ferry to Belle Chasse, is the last chance for gas going down river on this bank. \n\nA number of small communities line the road. A few old plantation houses dot the route, of more modest size than the grand mansions up river; some are immaculately restored, others in states of ruin. \n\nAt the town of Phoenix the road splits.
