It is subdivided into Pano (upper) and Kato (Lower) Platres, which fuels healthy local rivalry (the Pano lot consider themselves superior) but for all intents and purposes its is the same village. Perched high up (at an altitude of 1200 metres) on the Troodos Mountains, it is a refuge from the sweltering heat that dominates summer period on the lower parts of the island. In the winter bring thick clothing, plus a couple of skis. Trekking gear is a must.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nBy car or powerful motorbike. Taxi would cost a fortune from any of the cities. Rural bus services do exist (from Nicosia and Limassol) but service although cheap, is often unreliable.

The local tavernas are on par with your average everywhere else on the island. They are excellent value for money. Unless you are desperate donâ€™t even bother trying out any international cuisine restaurants as you will be disappointed. With the exception of course of the Forest Park Hotel, see below.\n\nFarmed trout fish is the local specialty. Kebabs and meze are just as common (and palatable) as everywhere else on the island. Lokoumades and shamishi, are  popular (but calorie ridden) deserts. If you are on a diet, chose from a healthy selection of fresh local fruit especially during the summer months.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nZivania (potent local version of grappa).
