It is a pedestrian only, cobblestone lined street which spans approximately 20 blocks. Along 5th Ave. you will find a variety of restaurants, bars, clubs, shopping opportunities and various services. In Playa, nearly everything starts from this street.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\nThe closest airport to Playa is the Cancún International Airport.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nBuses can be taken directly from the Cancún International Airport for around USD12. To get to the ADO BUS, veer right after exiting the main terminal and walk about 200 yards.  Purchase a ticket (buying it in pesos will save you a few dollars) right before exiting the terminal or at a kiosk right at the bus. Rental cars and one-way transfer services are also available. Tickets for children are half-price.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nHighway 307 is the only highway that passes by Playa. As you approach Playa from Cancún, the highway divides. Keep left and you will take the raised freeway past the city, keep right and you'll be able to access the city streets. The first east-west artery to Playa is Avenida Constituyentes, which works well for destinations in northern Playa tourist zone. The second is Avenida Juárez, which leads to the town's main square, The ADO Tourist bus terminal, and the Cozumel ferry dock.\n\nThe central bus station, right next to the taxi street, sells rides to the entirety of the Yucatán peninsula. Bus travel is relatively inexpensive, you can either travel second class, or first class, which is sometimes also called 'Express' although it is not notably any faster at all. First class buses cost around 40% more and will have toilets and TVs on them, but both classes have air conditioning. A second class ticket to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chetumal"]]}," on the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Belize"]]},"an border costs MXN116 (USD11) and takes around 4 1\/2 hours .\n\nThere are a lot of so-called \"Travel Agencies\" on the 5th Avenue in Playa del Carmen.

Boats leave roughly every hour, from 08:00-20:00, and the ride itself is 30 minutes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nBecause the layout of downtown Playa is a rectangular grid, getting around is very easy. \n \nThe main east-west street, Avenida Juárez, connects Highway 307 with the town square, El Zócalo, near the beach. As it does so, it crosses several numbered north-south avenues that run parallel to the beach, all of which, interestingly enough, are multiples of five. Quinta Avenida (Fifth Avenue), the closest to the beach, is closed to traffic from the Zócalo to Calle 6 (and some blocks beyond, in the evening). \n \nAlmost the entire town is north and west of the town square, El Zócalo. The east-west streets parallel to Avenida Juárez are numbered Calle, with even numbers to the north of Juárez and odd numbers to the south.  The other main east-west street Avenida Constituyentes is located where you would expect to find Calle 18.\n\nTo the south of the downtown is \"Playacar\" a golf-course development of private residences and a dozen resort hotels.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By foot"]},"\nPlaya is pedestrian friendly town and you can basically walk to everything.  The main north-south pedestrianized street, 5th Ave, does not allow cars except in the early morning hours for deliveries.  On 5th Avenue are many hotels, restaurants, and small shops. The north-south thoroughfare Avenida 30, five blocks west of 5th Ave, is where the large stores are located.  To walk from the town square, El Zócalo, and Avenida Juarez to Avenida Constituyentes takes only about 10 minutes.\n\nA bike is a fun alternative to walking; there are a number of bike rental shops at the north end of 5th Ave.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nCar rentals are readily available at a number of locations at the north end of 5th Ave. Large companies, National, Hertz, etc. are convenient, as well as local agencies, which are generally less expensive.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\n\n5th Ave. ('Quinta Avenida' or '5ta Av.') is a pedestrianized street and taxis are available at various intersections along its length. A taxi taken from a  'sitio' (place where taxis park) will cost a few dollars more than a taxi hailed on the street. It costs USD7 to get to Playacar, and about USD1.50 to get around the rest of Playa.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nScheduled bus service to destinations in the region (e.g. Xcaret, Xel-ha, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tulum"]]},", Cancun airport, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cancún"]]},", etc.) and beyond depart from Playa bus station at southern end of 5ta Avenida and Avenida Juárez, which is near the Ferry terminal to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cozumel"]]},".\n\nFirst class ADO bus departs hourly or so for tourist destination of Xcaret, Xel-ha and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tulum"]]}," - fares are in USD4 range. The ADO Bus goes directly to the entrances of Xcaret and Xel-ha. ADO also runs direct service to Cancun airport from Playa Del Carmen for approximately USD12 (MXN116).\n\nSecond class local Mayab buses also leave from Fifth Avenue station. Mayab buses stop more frequently en route and drop off alongside the highway to Tulum, requiring walking from the highway to the entrances of Xcaret or Xel-ha.\n\nAn alternative to the buses is to catch a \"colectivo\" van. These leave\/return at Playa from a location on Calle 2 between Av 10 and Av 15. Colectivos are cheap government regulated air-conditioned vans which transport people on Hwy. 307, which runs north\/south along the coast between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tulum"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cancún"]]},". Pick-up times for these collectivos vary, roughly every 10 minutes, and pick-up\/drop-off is simply along the freeway; but one can get you a ride near to any destination between Tulum and Cancun for as little as USD3. \nThere are also vans either ran by individuals or tour vans returning empty from a drop off that will pick you up alongside Hwy 307.  The easiest way to catch one is to wait at a bus stop and extend your hand out (like a handshake). Sometimes a van will flash their lights which is asking if you want them to stop. Prices vary, but can be as cheap as MXN3.  They pickup up and down the entire length of the highway. Most all speak English. They drop you off ONLY along the highway at your choice. No door to door service.\n\nOrganized bus tours are also available from a variety of companies that cross the Riviera Maya & Yucatán (Tulum, Cancun, Isla Mujeres, Mahahual, Ek Balam, Celestun, Rio Lagartos, Mérida, Chichen Itza, Uxmal, Coba, Sian Ka'an, Xcaret, Xelha, etc.).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Charter fishing"]},"\nYou may see many boats on the beach in Playa del Carmen waiting for a deep sea fishing charter. Most of these boats are unlicensed and provide the bare necessities. They are generally small \"pangas\" which may or may not even offer shade. The equipment is generally sub-par. The professional charter fleet is in Puerto Aventuras which is about ten km south of Playa. Puerto Aventuras is the oldest and nicest marina on the Riviera Maya. The protection is so good that the Cozumel Ferries park there in bad weather. There are numerous charter boats available from 29-47 feet. For not much extra money (if any) you can upgrade to a private boat.  Just walk past the charter boats and you will find private boats. These boats are privately owned by affluent owners who maintain them with an open check book. Some of them offer their boats for occasional charter. The extra effort is well worth it.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Diving"]},"\nScuba diving and snorkeling is plentiful around Playa, though the reefs are off the shore require a boat to get to. The offshore reef is part of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mesoamerican Barrier Reef"]]},", the second largest coral reef system in the world. All hotels have a dive shop, though many can be found on 5th Ave.  Better open-water scuba diving can generally be found in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cozumel"]]}," so if this is the focus of your trip it is best to stay there. Excellent snorkeling is located at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Puerto Morelos"]]},", located roughly halfway between Playa del Carmen and Cancun, and in the lagoon at Akumal, on the way to Tulum. Several dive shops in Playa del Carmen do offer cenote diving south of town.\n\nCenotes are cavernous freshwater sinkholes which are found all over the Yucatán peninsula. Many of them are open to the public for swimming, diving, and exploration. Many are open, however some of them are partially underground and the caves associated with these cenotes can run for miles underground. Cenotes also vary in size with openings as little as a foot wide to as large as a small lake. The water clarity in these cenotes is often unsurpassed, often exceeding 200 feet, and makes for exceptionally good swimming. Some of the bigger cenotes are available as tourist destinations, many are locally owned, and many more still are either undiscovered or undeveloped. Entrance to the commercial cenotes is correlated to the amount of development (i.e. if there are washrooms, restaurants, showers, etc.) with fees ranging from USD1-20.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Abyss Dive Center and Training Facility"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.abyssdivecenter.com"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=AlwaysDiving"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.alwaysdiving.com"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=A good place to do your diving or scuba diving classes.

It is possible to buy both Mexican and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cuba"]]},"n cigars here, but Cuban cigar prices are not particularly cheap. Counterfeits are commonplace in Mexico, so due diligence in the selection of cigars is advisable. If you are young or have long hair, many shop keepers are likely to also offer you marijuana.

As is the case in much of Mexico, the street food is not to be missed. Simply walk south down 5th Ave until you reach the pier and taxi stand. There are generally five or six carts there serving tacos of various types. Every seafood taco is generally outstanding, along with the carnitas, pollo, and chorizo.
