[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Caribbean default banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Playas del Coco"]},"  is a small beach town in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guanacaste"]]}," province, on the North Pacific Coast of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Costa Rica"]]},". It is close to several beaches including Ocotal, Playa Hermosa and Playa Panama.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe closest major city is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Liberia"]]},", Costa Rica.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\nIt is 30 minutes by taxi from ",{"type":"'''","value":["Liberia International Airport"]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n5 hours from San José, 3 buses per day leaving San José at 8am, 2pm and 4pm and returning from Playas del Coco at 4am, 8am and 2pm.  1 hour from Liberia, buses every hour until 11am and then every 2.5 hours until 6:30pm.  The bus company is called Pulmitan 2222-1650.

If you're only in Coco for a few days and don't want to invest in a rental car, this is your best option.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Rental Car:"]}," This is the best way to tour Coco and surrounding areas, and essential if you plan on staying more than a few days. It's recommended that you rent a 4x4, but a 4x4 is not necessary if you're a careful and competent off-road driver who understands the limitations of a car.\n\nIf you rent a car, you should be aware that all rental cars are easily identifiable by locals (rental cars use a different type of license plate). Therefore, you should NEVER leave any valuables unattended in your rental car, as they are constantly targeted by thieves. Also, local police can instantly identify a rental car and will not hesitate to pull over a tourist for speeding, so follow the speed limit closely.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThis area of Costa Rica is short on historical attractions, museums, art galleries, etc. If you're in Coco, you're going to see beaches, wildlife, and enjoy the sun.\n\nPopular beaches near Coco include Hermosa, Ocotal, Flamingo (incredibly popular with the locals on weekends), Panama, and a handful of remote beaches on the Papagayo peninsula (including the beach at the Four Season Papagayo). Further away, Tamarindo is an excellent surf beach for beginners, as well as a more commercialized beach town. If you're looking for something and can't find it in Coco, it's probably in Tamarindo (a little more than an hour away).\n\nDowntown Coco beach is worth a look, especially after nightfall. You'll find drinking, dancing, and dining options, and even a couple of casinos.\n\nCoco is also a great place to stay while exploring nearby natural wonders like the dormant volcano Rincon de la Vieja (about 1.5 hours driving time), Lllano de Cortes waterfall (about 2 hours drive time), and dozens of beaches within 1-2 hours drive (too many to mention, in fact). Jungle tours are also popular, and most of the local tour providers include a \"zip line\" tour as the main attraction.\n\nCoco is fairly far away from Arenal, a recently active Volcano that is a must-see of any Costa Rica visit. Therefore, if you plan on staying in Coco, you might want to set aside two days of your trip to visit and stay at a resort near the Arenal volcano.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nThe main beach in Coco is under renovation with a new boardwalk but it is still not the best looking beach. However, it's a great place to rent a boat for an excursion to nearby \"Gorilla rock\" (also known as \"monkey's head rock\") as well as some mangrove swamps up the coast. A boat can also take you to some very good quality snorkeling just off-shore. If you decide to rent a boat, be sure to negotiate hard. Often times you will be asked to pay twice as much when you first ask for a price.\n\nIf you have a rental car, you can drive to either Ocotal or Hermosa beach. Both of these beaches are much cleaner and only 5-10 minutes drive away. If you're looking for a nicer beach and\/or a longer trip, you can drive over to the Four Seasons Papagayo, park just outside the front gate, and then walk to the beach (in Costa Rica, all beaches are public, so they can't stop you from hanging out on their \"private\" beach).\n\nA local resident named Dr. Will ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.greenmysterycostarica.com\/nature-walk-with-dr-will-ocotal-beach-playas-del-coco\/"]}," offers an early-morning wildlife tour that will introduce you to Costa Rica wildlife right under your nose. Will is a retired veterinarian who lives in nearby Ocotal and offers individual tours for $30-40 per person, depending on the group size.\n\nDeep sea fishing excursions are definitely available as well - be sure to ask around on the beach in the late afternoon to find the best deal for the following day. You can also hire a boat to take you surfing off-shore near world famous Witch's Rock just up the coast from Coco. However, if you're new to surfing or not willing to invest in an all-day boat tour, you might consider driving about an hour to nearby Tamarindo. The surfing there is very good for beginners and kids.\n\nThere are many reputable dive companies in town including Summer-Salt",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.summer-salt.com"]},", and Deep Blue Diving ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.deepblue-diving.com\/en\/index.html"]},". Both employ people who have great depth of knowledge of not only what is in the ocean but what you can find on land. If you want to go sailing the Kuna Vela ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.kunavela.com"]}," and Marlin Negro both are large charter sailboats with experienced and knowledgeable crews.  \n\nFinally, much like any tourist-oriented community in Costa Rica, you will find organized jungle tours that include zip-line rides. While there are half-a-dozen local tour operators and zip-line operations, you might consider visiting the Hacidenda Gauchipelin ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.guachipelin.com"]}," for an all day package that includes a good quality zip line tour, and then your choice of a waterfall visit, a horseback ride, a soak in a mud bath, etc. Hacienda Guachipelin is about an hour away from Coco, but it's reasonable value and offers nice views of the dormant volcano Rincon de la Vieja.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Summer Salt Dive Center"],["url=http:\/\/www.summer-salt.com\/contact"],["email="],["address=100m sur del parque"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Guanacaste 5019"],["phone=(506) 2670-0308"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nDowntown Coco is the best place to find deals on clothes, souvenirs, and trinkets.
