Although the flight ended prematurely, due to engine failure, this was apparently 6 months before the Wright Brothers were to achieve something similar. In later years, Pearse himself claimed he only successfully flew in 1904, however eyewitness accounts and other historical evidence place his many of his witnessed flights as occurring during 1902 and 1903. Because Pearse didn't seek publicity for his flying activities or dispute the Wright Brothers claim to fame, by the time Pearse's achievements became widely known, the Wright Brothers had been acknowledged as the first to demonstrate that powered flight in a heavier than air machine was practical.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nOn State Highway 8, inland from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Timaru"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Richard Pearse Memorial"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=On the roadside"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=A replica model of one of Pearse's aircraft on top of a pole at about the height that Pearse might have achieved in flight."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Pleasant Point Museum and Railway"],["url=http:\/\/pleasantpointrail.org.nz\/"],["email="],["address=Pleasant Point Station, and Keanes Crossing Complex"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Catch the train at the station."],["phone=+64 3 614 8323"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=11 AM - 4 PM on steaming days"],["price=Adults $6, Children $4, Family $20"],["phoneextra=24 hour train info"],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Serenity Guest House Bed & Breakfast"],["alt=Serenity Motel"],["url=http:\/\/www.serenitymotels.co.nz\/"],["email=serenity.guesthouse@xtra.co.nz"],["address=8 Totara St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+64 3 614 8069"],["tollfree="],["fax=+64 3 614 7547"],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=State_Highway_8_NZ.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["directionl1=NW"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lake Tekapo"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fairlie"]]}],["directionr1=SE"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Timaru"]]}],["minorr1="]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Mid and South Canterbury"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Pleasant Point, New Zealand"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["-44.266666666667"],["171.13333333333"]]}]
