They have substantial oil exploration and development, a brisk Canadian trade, abundant wildlife, and a country personality where friends are friends indeed. The county incorporates modern schools, parks and recreational facilities, transportation, a modern hospital, elderly care and housing, and shopping facilities. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nThe county was organized April 1, 1913. Plentywood had incorporated in 1912 and was chosen as the County Seat. Sheridan County has a most interesting history (part wild west with the old-time outlaws using the famous Outlaw Trail to evade the law and part political excitement as the Communists tried to get a foothold on the citizenship here during the early thirties while the Great Depression was in full swing.)\n\nThe Outlaw Trail started at the Outlaw Caves in southern Saskatchewan, Canada, and wound it's way south through Sheridan County and as far south as Wyoming and beyond. The trail was in heavy use during Sheridan County's early days. Romantic stories abound concerning these famous outlaws who stole cattle and horses and occasionally robbed a bank or two, escaping and evading the law via the Outlaw Trail.\n\nThe Communist Era was another colorful historic time for the County. The Communists moved in and labored long and hard to convert the citizens to their political ways. They infiltrated the county government, had their own newspaper, and provide today's interesting tales of their struggles during their rise and fall.\n\nThe Oil Boom of the 70's and early 80's also added a robust flavor to life in Sheridan County. As the population in the county more than doubled, the \"live fast - work hard\" lifestyle became commonplace as poker chips from local saloons were treated as legal tender almost anywhere in the county. \n\nThere is something unique and special in small-town living. Everyone in Sheridan County can assure you of that! We welcome all to come and explore our little corner of the Big Sky.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nGo Bowling, See a movie, Play in the park, fishing at the dam\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nCousins, Randy's, Fryer Tucks, Gold Dollar, Blue Moon, Main Bistro\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nSpot Bar, Gold Dollar, Cassidy's, Blue Moon, Vets Club, Robin Hood Lounge\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nSherwood Inn\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=MT-5.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["directionl1=W"],["majorl1=END"],["minorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Scobey"]]}],["directionr1=E"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Crosby (North Dakota)"],["Crosby"]]}],["minorr1=becomes ",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:North Dakota 5.svg"],["18px"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["rtarrow"]]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ambrose (North Dakota)"],["Ambrose"]]}],["image2=MT-16.svg"],["imagesize2=22"],["directionl2=N"],["majorl2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Regina"]]}],["minorl2=becomes ",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Saskatchewan Highway 6 (jct).svg"],["18px"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["lfarrow"]]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Aiga immigration.svg"],["18px"]]}],["directionr2=S"],["majorr2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Glendive"]]}],["minorr2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sidney (Montana)"],["Sidney"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["48.776111"],["-104.558889"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Missouri River Country"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Plentywood, Montana"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North_America\/United_States\/Montana\/Localities\/P\/Plentywood\/"]]}]
