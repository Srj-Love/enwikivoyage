The city is split by a long pedestrian street with many shops and service facilities.\n\nThere is also an extensive network of buses and trolley-buses. A single ticket costs 0.70 BGN (feb 2012) and you pay to a person on the bus. Main trolley bus lines are numbers 3 and 7 (running between Storgozia and Kaylaka, passing close to the train and bus stations) and numbers 9 and 5, which run between the train\/bus station and Druzhba.\n\nTaxis are generally cheap. You would normally not pay more than 4 BGN within the city (feb 2012). Make sure the driver puts the meter on. There are numerous taxi stands in the centre and around many bus stops. You can also call a taxi (some numbers: 064 \/ 88-89,  064 \/ 88-00, 064 \/ 81-55-55), but do not expect them to speak much English.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThe Historical Museum in downtown Pleven hosts many exhibitions, including one on the famous Bulgarian soprano Ghena Dimitrova. \n\nBy far the most popular sight of Pleven is the Pleven Panorama, which depicts the events of the Russian-Turkish War of 1877–78, specifically the five-month Siege of Plevna (Pleven Epopee) which made the city internationally famous and which contributed to the Liberation of Bulgaria after five centuries of Ottoman rule.\n\nDuring the summer the many fountains and a water cascade on the central pedestrian street are a favourite place for relaxation among locals.\n\nPleven is famous for its Kaylaka (where the ruins of the Storgosia fortification can be found) and Skobelev parks. The latter is home to the Pleven Panorama and was where most of the battles took place. The Kaylaka park is very popular among locals. There is a zoo, a pond where you can rent a boat and row, tennis courts, bicycle lanes, perfect places for picnics or playing games. There are a few hiking trails around, up to some cliffs and caves. If you want to spend a couple of days relaxing in the park, also consider staying at the nearby hostel. From the city you can either walk or take trolley buses 3 or 7 to their last stop.\n\nA very interesting and somewhat underestimated sight is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["'Svetlin Rusev Donative Exhibition"]},"' (Bulgarian: Изложба-дарение „Светлин Русев“, Izlozhba-darenie „Svetlin Rusev“), which includes the personal collection of the famous Bulgarian artist.
