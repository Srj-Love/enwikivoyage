Especially the cities along the San River became very rich in the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Beautiful palaces were built in Lublin Renaissance, Mannerist and Baroque style by the nobility of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. After the First Partition of Poland in 1772 most of its territory was annexed by Austria and formed a part of the so called Galicja-Lodomeria. Galicja-Lodomeria gained an autonomy within the Austria-Hungary empire in 1867. After World War I Podkarpacie became part of the Second Polish Republic, but was divided along the San River after the invasion of Poland and occupied by Nazi-Germany and the Soviet Union between 1939 and 1944, when its Western part in 1939 and its Eastern part in 1941 were incorporated into the German General government. After World War II it again became part of Poland.
