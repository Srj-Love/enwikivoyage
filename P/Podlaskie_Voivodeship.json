After the union between the Kingdom of Poland and the Duchy of Lithuania in 1385, Podlasie became the middle part of the Jagiellonian state with major trade routes from the Vistula towns to Vilnius crossing it. Beautiful Baroque palaces, churches and synagogues were built during the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Besides Roman Catholics, Greek Catholics, Orthodox Christians, and Jews, also the Moslem Tatars settled here since the 17th century. After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795 most of its territory was annexed by Russian Empire. After the Congress of Vienna it became either part of the Kingdom of Poland, ruled by the Russian Tsar, or part of the Russia proper. After World War I, Podlasie became part of the Second Polish Republic; it was occupied by the Soviet Union in 1939-1942, and by Germany between 1942 and 1944. After World War II, it became part of Poland again. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nThere is no international airport in Podlaskie Voivodeship.
