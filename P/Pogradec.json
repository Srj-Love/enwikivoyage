Overshadowed by its glitzy neighbors on the Macedonian side of the lake, the town of Pogradec has been experiencing a revival recently. After communism collapsed, the once popular lakeside resort town went into a state of decay and disrepair, with minimal investment undertaken. The urban development that took place was generally chaotic and unappealing.  However today, private investors and government, interested in bringing Pogradec to its' former glory, have begun pouring in money to the town. A waste water treatment plant is being built (soon to be completed), and will return the excellent water clarity that is seen on the Macedonian part, to the Albanian part of the lake as well. Hotels are being built or renovated and refurbished, and infrastructure is improving throughout.\n",{"type":"===","value":["Visitor information"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Pogradec Tourist Information Center"],["url=http:\/\/www.pogradec.info"],["email="],["address=Rr.
