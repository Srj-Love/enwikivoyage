It is roughly circular and about 60 miles around.\n\nPohnpei is the most developed of the four states in Micronesia.  \n\nPohnpei is also one of the rainiest inhabited place in the world. With about 300 inches of rain per year at the higher elevations and 150 inches at the waterfront, and no dry season, expect it to rain every day, with alternating patches of sun, clouds, and rain. However, since the temperature hovers around 85°F (about 27°C), the rain is never seen as much of a nuisance, and most people walk around without umbrellas or other rain gear. Rain can often be seen as a relief, because it cools the weather down a few degrees and keeps the humidity from feeling oppressive.\n\nThe Northern end of the island has most of the population, as well as the city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kolonia"]]},". There are no well-defined boundaries to the city, and the townships are all quite near each other.  There is a ring road that circles the island.  Most people live on the ring road.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nThe regional language of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pohnpei"]]}," is Pohnpeian. However, most people learn English as well. Outside of the capital and the college, most people only have rudimentary English skills, and once you get into the villages, only Pohnpeian is spoken, by and large. The older population has more proficiency in Japanese, the language of the occupation during their childhood.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nUnited Airlines is the only airline with flights to Micronesia. They offer an island-hopper flight, which goes East to West on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, and West to East on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The airport is small, and most checking on the islands is done by hand, so expect to have all of your luggage (carry-on or check-in) hand-searched. Because of this, check-in generally happens at least an hour before boarding, even though there are never huge numbers of people at the airport.\n\nIntrepid travelers arrive on their sailboats to visit Pohnpei.  There is a very nice lagoon for sailboats.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nStreet names are not generally used to give directions.  There are no addresses.  Fortunately, there is only one main road and it is pretty easy to get around.  If you are lost, locals know where practically everything is and are happy to give directions.\n\nThere are some car rentals available on Pohnpei.  The roads are in fair to poor condition, and potholes are common.  Cars will drive on the wrong side of the road to avoid potholes.  It is acceptable to pass a slow moving car anywhere there is enough space.  At night many drivers are intoxicated on Sakau and tend to drive very slowly.  There is little in the way of signage.\n\nThere are also taxis, which are relatively cheap.  A taxi ride in Kolonia will cost $1 per person.  Prices increase the farther you go outside of Kolonia.  \n\nWalking is easy, as there are few distances within the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kolonia"]]}," area which are more than a couple of miles away.  Many people walk around town.

Other times though it still remains a quiet and uncrowded island for surfers.\nTo get to the best waves in Pohnpei you will need to get a ride from one of the many local fishermen with boats.\nYou can easily check to see if there are waves from the hotels in town.  South Park Hotel sits above Kolonia harbor and faces directly north toward Main Pass, Center Channel and gives a peak of Lighthouse Pass.  Ocean View Hotel, aptly named, has clear views to the reef line on the north side of the island which provide a full indicator of what the swell is doing.     \n\nA short drive to Nan Pohnmal (5 minutes)west of town where the U.S. Embassy housing complex is located provides a clear view of the entire NW reef including Palikir Pass which is easily seen from the bluff top vista. \n\nThe local crew recommends NIHCO Marine Park which is in Sekere along the north western shore of the lagoon at the closest point of land to Palikir Pass.
