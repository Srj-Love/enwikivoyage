These days it's best-known for a series of mysterious paranormal occurrences that began in 1966. Starting on November 12th of that year, locals began to catch glimpses of an odd flying creature - people generally described it as a very large grey man-shaped creature, with giant wings and large red eyes - that pursued people and even killed their pets, apparently making its home in an abandoned TNT plant outside of town. The newspapers called it ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mothman"]},", and there were over 100 sightings of it during the next year. Then tragedy struck: on December 15, 1967, the 700-foot ",{"type":"'''","value":["Silver Bridge"]}," between Point Pleasant and Ohio collapsed, killing 46 people. Following the collapse, sightings of the Mothman dropped off, leading some to hypothesize that the Mothman was a sort of harbinger of doom. This same period was marked with an apparent increase in paranormal phenomena, and some have linked the entire series of events to an old Native American curse that was reputedly put on the area by a murdered chief. The events surrounding the sightings inspired the book ",{"type":"''","value":["The Mothman Prophecies"]},", on which the 2002 film was based.\n\nPoint Pleasant was also the site of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["First Battle of the Revolution"]}," - the Battle of Point Pleasant on October 10, 1774, between the Virginia militia and the Shawnee led by Chief Cornstalk (he of the curse).
