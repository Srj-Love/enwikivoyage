Usually, there are constant winds of moderate to strong velocity on the exposed headlands and outer beaches. Headlands and beaches on the Pacific Coast are subjected to frequent heavy fogs, most commonly during July, August and September. Sunshine and higher temperatures occur inland. The east side of Inverness Ridge and the beaches of Tomales Bay are sheltered from the summit of the ridge westward to the ocean, leaving sunny areas for picnicking and swimming. Inland temperatures in the summer are often 20 degrees warmer than temperatures on the Headlands and outer coast. The rainy season is December through March.

There have been several incidents of visitors to Point Reyes being caught by sneaker waves and drowned. Sneaker waves also have the ability to toss around large driftwood logs that may fall on a person, injuring or even killing them.  Sneaker waves can occur at any time, day or night, during incoming and outgoing tides, during storms and during sunny calm weather; they are often preceded by a sudden lowering of the water level.\n\nAn additional danger comes from rip currents, which are channeled currents of water flowing away from shore that can easily drag strong swimmers out to sea.  If you are caught in a rip current, remain calm and swim along the shoreline in order to escape the outgoing current.  Once out of the current, swim towards shore.\n\nAnother park danger is from hypothermia.  The coastal water temperatures at Point Reyes rarely exceed 50°F, and prolonged exposure to these temperatures can result in hypothermia (abnormally low body temperature) or death. Do not stay in the water for more than a few minutes unless you are wearing a wetsuit. Do not wait until you start to shiver or for your lips to turn blue before you get out of the water; if you start to shiver, you are already suffering from mild hypothermia.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Point Reyes Station"]]}]},".
