There is an odd competition among villages in the region for the title of the northern hemisphere's coldest place.\n\nThese conditions have created a weird sort of opportunity for adventure travel. Every year since 2001, the Annual Pole of Cold Festival takes place there. The exhibition of the national clothes, applied art and the national food of the people of the North, deer-drawn race teams, ice fishing and other activities are held during the festival. The major event of the festival is the auto tour Yakutsk-Oymyakon, 1,270 km (789 mi) of snowy trails including 403 km (250 mi) of regularity rally. Although this event is an extreme sport it also includes sightseeing, visiting museums, ethnographic complexes and historic places.
