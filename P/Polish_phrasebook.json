The latter two are actually more easily understood by a speaker of Polish, even though they have somewhat different interpretations of the Latin alphabet.\n\nThe language is unique in that it retains the ",{"type":"'''","value":["nasal sounds"]}," lost in other Slavic languages and uses a unique ",{"type":"'''","value":["diacritic mark, an ''ogonek''''' (a \"little tail\") attached to "]},"a",{"type":"'''","value":[" and "]},"e",{"type":"'''","value":[" to express them.

For example, ",{"type":"''","value":["Ania kocha Jacka"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["Jacka kocha Ania"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["Ania Jacka kocha"]},", etc. all translate to  ",{"type":"''","value":["Annie loves Jack"]},", a sentence that cannot be further reordered without changing the meaning.
