It is home to Fantasy of Flight and located on the southern edge of the Green Swamp.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nThe town proper consists of just 1500 people and 0.8 mi",{"type":"<","value":["small",[{"type":"<","value":["sup",["2"]]}]]}," (2 km",{"type":"<","value":["small",[{"type":"<","value":["sup",["2"]]}]]},") of land. Despite the tiny size, Polk City refers to most of the north-central part of the county. This area is part of the Green Swamp, which is the origin of most of west-central Florida's rivers, including the Peace, Hillsborough, Withlacoochee, & Ocklawaha Rivers. The town, just like the county, is named for James Polk, the 11th president of the United States.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Forecast"],["Polk City"],["28.180052"],["-81.826318"]]},"\n\nPolk City's climate is much the same as the rest of Central Florida (except coasts). Winters are mild, with highs in the 70s (21-27°C) and lows in the 50s (10-15°C). Lows in the 30s (0-5°C) are common after cold fronts and there are usually a handful of lows below freezing each winter, although that requires clear skies, so it usually warms very rapidly after sunrise (30°F at 6AM, 55°F by noon is typical). Cold fronts occasionally pass by as squall lines, so tornadoes in December or January are not unusual. Snow is rare; the last measurable snowfall was in 1977, although sleet\/wintry mix fell in an unusually cold January 2010. Summers are hot and humid, with highs around 90-95°F (33-35°C) and lows around 74-78°F (23-26°C). During the summer, onshore winds from both coasts travel inland, heat up, rise and build into thunderstorms, usually along a rough line. Lying in the center of the state, the line of storms (each called a \"seabreeze\") often collide and become severe, with tornadoes (small EF0-1s...not like the powerful tornadoes in the Plains states), 50+ mph winds, and hail possible. Strong storms are usually preceded by cooler winds caused by the rain-cooled air (cold air sinks) rapidly flowing away from the storm. The temperature after a strong thunderstorm passes can drop from 95°F (35°C) to 75°F (24°C) and since the storms can be fairly small, you can drive 5 miles and the temperature will drop\/rise 20°F (10°C) between rain-cooled and surrounding areas.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Fantasy of Flight B-26.JPG"],["thumb"],["250px"],["One of just 6 surviving B-26 Marauder aircraft from WWII and the only airworthy one in the world on display at Fantasy of Flight."]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nPolk City is located just off of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Interstate 4"]},", roughly half-way between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tampa"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Orlando"]]},".
