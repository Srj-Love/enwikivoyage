The county is a mix of suburban Lakeland, Winter Haven\/Auburndale, and Haines City\/Davenport areas, several small towns, and large swaths of rural areas. The county was once the leading citrus producer in the state. The county saw a lot of development during the boom in the 2000s decade that included a lot of citrus groves gobbled up.

Between early May and late September, daytime highs run over 90°F (32°C) but rarely above 96-97°F (36°C). Nighttime lows during this period are in the mid-70s (°F; around 24°C). The rainy season runs from early-mid June through mid-late September. The humid air heats up, rises and condenses into thunderstorms, which are experienced just about every afternoon during the rainy season. These thunderstorms can sometimes be severe, producing high wind gusts, hail, and occasionally a weak tornado (most are E.F.0 or E.F.1). Lightning is the biggest hazard from these storms and is a major concern when planning outdoor activities. \n\nWinters are mild, with highs averaging around 70°F (21°C) and lows in the low 50s (°F; 10-12°C). Temperatures above 80°F (26°C) are possible. Cold fronts every 10-14 days will typically bring some rain to mark their passing followed by cooler weather for a few days. Temperatures following a cold front can drop into the 50s & 60s (°F; 10-20°C) and lows into the 30s & 40s (°F; 0-10°C). Only a couple nights each year will reach freezing or below (<32°F, <0°C). Spring and Fall are transitional seasons as far as temperatures are concerned. Falls will have the occasional cold front bringing a light rain, while spring (especially April-May) is the driest time of year. \n\nHurricanes and tropical storms occasionally affect Polk County during Hurricane Season (Jun 1-Nov 30). Each storm is different, so watch the news. Tropical storms will affect the county every couple of years and usually just bring some extra rain and perhaps a few severe thunderstorms. Hurricanes only affect Polk County once or twice a decade and the effects vary from storm to storm. The 2004 hurricane season was unprecedented for Polk County, when the centers of ",{"type":"''","value":["three"]}," hurricanes passed through the county: Hurricanes Charley, Frances, and Jeanne. Hurricane Charley was the most powerful, but had a very small wind field for a hurricane, sparing the Lakeland area significant damage, but pummeling Fort Meade, Bartow, Lake Wales, Winter Haven, Haines City, & Davenport with 90-115 mph (150-185 km\/h) winds! However, for perspective, these were the first hurricanes since 1960 to pass through the county. \n\nIn drier years, spring (until the rainy season begins) is wildfire season. Fog can be an occasional issue in winter months, especially in the Green Swamp area of north-central Polk County, which includes Interstate 4 between Polk City & Davenport.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Visitor Information"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Central Florida Visitor's & Convention Bureau"],["url=http:\/\/www.visitcentralflorida.org"],["email="],["address=2701 Lake Myrtle Park Rd, Auburndale"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 863 551-4750"],["tollfree=+1 800 828-7655"],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Polk Outpost 27 Visitor Information Center"],["url=http:\/\/www.visitcentralflorida.org\/destinations\/polk-outpost-27-visitor-information-center"],["email="],["address=101 Adventure Ct, Davenport"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Located on the west side of U.S. 27, just south of I-4."],["phone=+1 863 420-2586"],["tollfree=+1-800-828-7655"],["fax="],["hours=Daily 9AM-6PM"],["price="],["content=The county's visitor information center offers more than just brochures & a gift shop.

Flights operate based on demand, not a regular schedule, and can be booked as soon as 4 hours before departure, if aircraft are available, and don't require reaching the airport 2 hours in advance for screening & check-in. The convenience comes at a price, an example one-way fare from Lakeland-Key West is $957 for 1 passenger or $478\/person for 2 passengers.\n\nThe difference between travel times to reach either airport is about 30 min when traveling from just about every corner of the county (except Davenport and the \"Four Corners\" area near Disney World, which are much closer to O.I.A.).
