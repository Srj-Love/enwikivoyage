You reach it from the Palma - Alcudia highway, the turn to Pollenca is some 40 km from Palma and after that you have 7 km by fair road. From the airport, Pollenca is reached by taking the Palma direction, taking the first turn off (el Coll d'en Rebassa) and heading for Inca until you hit the Palma-Inca (and on to Port d'Alcudia) highway. After that, see above.\nDriving and parking in Pollenca is awful. Try to find a parking spot on the lower part of the city where you enter it, and walk from there.

The name Puig de Pollença or Puig de Maria refers to the hill as well as to the ancient hermit nun's monastery on its top. Its first origins reach back to 1348. Main parts of the complex have been built in the 15th century. After 1564, it was only sporadically used as monastery, while the church had been maintained during all the centuries as a pilgrim church. The last nuns left the convent in 1988. Since then, it is used as a hostel. Its location high over the town of Pollença and the old, venerable but simple buildings together with the view on the coastline, the Serra de Tramuntana and the wide plane give quite a mystical atmosphere.
