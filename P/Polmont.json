Constructed during the reign of the roman Emperor Antonius Pius  (138 AD - 161 AD) the wall runs across Scotland at its narrowest point between the Firth of Forth in the east and the River Clyde in the west. Although built to rival Hadrian's Wall, the emperor Antonius Pius succeeded, the wall was far less elaborate. Unlike its more solid southern counterpart, the Antonine Wall was built of turf fronted by a ditch 12 feet deep. The wall was 10 feet high and 14 feet wide and dotted with 29 small military forts linked by a road.As a defensive barrier the Antonine Wall did not fulfill its role for long. In 181 the northern tribes poured over the wall and pushed the Romans back to Hadrian's Wall. The Romans finally abandoned any hope of regaining the territory between the two walls in 196 AD. Antonine Wall facts:Length 37 miles (59 km)Built 140-142 AD.
