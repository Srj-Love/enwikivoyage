Pompeii is an excavation (It: ",{"type":"''","value":["scavi"]},") site and outdoor museum of the ancient Roman settlement. This site is considered to be one of the few sites where an ancient city has been preserved in detail - everything from jars and tables to paintings and people was frozen in time, yielding, together with neighbouring ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Herculaneum"]]}," which suffered the same fate, an unprecedented opportunity to see how the people lived two thousand years ago.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Tickets"]},"\nOne-day tickets are €11 per adult; €5,50 for EU citizens between 18 - 24 and school teachers; EU citizens below 18 or above 65 get in for free (valid proving age document needed).

They are not available at the secondary Eastern entrance by the Ampitheatre - which is the entrance nearest the modern day town centre if you are walking. Unofficial audio guides are on offer at one of the market stalls near this entrance. Take note that audioguide maps are not the same and the official audioguide comes with more audio points of interest.  It's a good idea to check out both options before deciding.  Pompeii may take several hours to explore so make sure to ask about the audioguide battery life before your purchase. Tour guides also cluster near the entrance and offer their services. It's a good idea to talk to one for a couple of minutes before deciding, to make sure you can understand their accent when they speak English.

There are a few bicycles for rent, but the surfaces make them rather impractical. Note that walking the old Roman stone roads can be quite exhausting, especially in the heat of summer with loads of fellow tourists about. Everyone will be walking on cobblestones and uneven ground.  The temperature is between 32 and 35c in the summer.  Make sure to take plenty of water and watch your step as the old roads have grooves in them where the carts ran. It is advisable to wear good footwear, sunscreen and hats.  There is a lot to look at and it could take all day to see everything.\n\nOn buying your ticket you should receive a map of the site and a booklet listing the main attractions. However, these can be sometimes out of print or you may find that the only booklet available is in Italian. A map of the site is essential if you want to see a lot in as short a time as possible. Even with a map visiting Pompeii is a bit like a trip to a maze. Many of the roads, apparently open according to the map, turn out to be blocked off for excavations or repairs, or, as happened in 2010, because a building collapsed. You might think you are heading for the exit but then have to turn around and retrace your steps to find another route.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:PompeiM.jpg"],["thumb"],["Someone who did not escape the eruption"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Pompei0002.jpg"],["thumb"],["Storage of Artifacts"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Shabbytravel Pompeii Body.jpg"],["thumb"],["Another victim of the eruption"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Ancient Rome Pompeii Forum.JPG"],["thumb"],["Forum"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Baker's oven Pompei.JPG"],["thumb"],["Oven"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Ancient Bar (Pompeii).jpg"],["thumb"],["Bar"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Perro_en_Pompeya.jpg"],["thumb"],["A sleeping feral dog"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Amphitheatre"],["alt=Anfiteatro"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat=40.7515"],["long=14.4947"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=This is in the most easterly corner of the excavated area, near the Sarno Gate entrance.
