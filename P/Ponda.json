Ponda is geographically at the heart of Goa, has been surrounded by scenic green villages, filled with grand temples rather different from the more crowded coast. It is located some 29 kms from Panaji (or Panjim), the state-capital, and the Goa government has called it \"the cultural city of Goa\". \n\nPonda is made up of a crowded, dusted town of the same name (Ponda) and a number of clean, scenic, rustic villages interspersed with scenic temples. Ponda is also known for its proximity to Goa's wildlife, and is the cultural capital for Indian-style music in Goa, apart from being the heartland for the celebration of a number of Hindu festivities. Of late, Ponda is also attracting visitors for its 'spice tourism' that it promotes (visits to real-life spice farm, which offer a tour and food on their estates).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nCalled Phonda in Konkani, it is 28 kms south-east of Panjim and 17 kms north east of Margao. Ponda is the gateway to Belgaum, Hubli and other cities to the east of Goa (in Karnataka and beyond).\n\nPonda lies in the so-called 'New Conquests'. In the heat of Portuguese religious intolerance centuries ago, Ponda was a safe-haven for Hindus fleeing Portuguese religion-based persecution, in times when it was ruled by local feudatories of the Vijaynagar kingdom or the Bijapur sultanate. This accounts for the large number of temples resettled from Salcete and elsewhere in and around Ponda. Konkani is widely used here. Marathi, Hindi and Kannada too.
