You will need a 4WD.\n\nGetting there on public transport is time-consuming. Take the ferry to Catembe - several chapas run daily to Ponta d'Ouro along the mostly sandy road. The journey takes 3-4 hours plus numerous breakdowns. It is best to get their early as chapas only leave when they are full and the most demand is early. If you get there at 7am you will probably wait less than one hour for a chapa to fill up, if you arrive in the afternoon you may wait many hours.\n\nA couple of tour operators do transfers to Ponta D'Ouro. These transfers are not cheap and are best to do in groups of at least 4 people. If you have the budget this transfer can save a very difficult ride, especially when returning, as chapas leaving from Ponta D'Ouro to Maputo generally only leave early in the morning.\n\nIt is possible to cycle from Maputo using a mountain bike, but be prepared to push your bike through 30km of thick sand.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nGetting around in Ponta is generally only done on foot unless you have a 4WD.

Learning more about how they are threatened in the wild will also broaden your understanding of the need to protect these magnificent creatures.\n\nBe aware that many of the activities offered, such as jet skiing, quad-biking and 4x4ing on the beach are either not permitted, although not strictly controlled, and\/or can be very environmentally destructive and disturbing to the animals. When offered the opportunity to do activities such as viewing nesting turtles and going to see dolphins, try and make sure that this does not disturb the animals and is not destructive to the environment.\n\nPartake in a Shebeen (name for local pubs) tour along the road from Ponta Malangane and Ponto D'oura. There are about 6 -7 rustic pubs a stone throw away from each other along a stretch of rough road.
