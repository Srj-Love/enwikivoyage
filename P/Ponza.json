In Roman times it was used as a place to deport, and usually put to death, those who fell foul of Rome's authorities. In the Middle Ages it could not be protected against raids by Saracens and pirates and was abandoned. It was re-occupied in the 18th Century. The island is a popular tourist spot for Italian holidaymakers in the summer, although some of the popular beaches have been closed because of falling rocks that have in the past killed sunbathers.\n\nIn the Italian Fascist era Ponza served as a penal colony.
