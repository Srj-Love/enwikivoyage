A number of Colombian presidents were born in Popayan including, most recently, Guillermo Leon Valencia from 1962 to 1966. Other well-known citizens include Francisco Jose de Caldas (1768-1816) and Camilo Torres (1766-1816).  Popayán has one of Colombia's oldest universities: the Universidad del Cauca, founded in 1827.

The floats are carried on the shoulders of human volunteers.  It's a great honour to be selected for the Semana Santa processions but the floats can weigh up to 500 kilo and so dislocated shoulders are frequent.
