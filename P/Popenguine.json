Popenguine is a member of Global Ecovillage Network of Senegal (GENSEN). It is known for its natural reserve, pristine sandy beach, and religious significance. It is also the weekend getaway for the President of Senegal, as the second presidential residence is located between Popenguine and the village of Ndayane.  \n\nThe Natural Reserve of Popenguine is located to the south and was created in 1986 thanks in large part to the local women's group, RFPPN. It is the first and only reserve managed by the Park Service in partnership with the local women’s group. The woman’s group had the foresight to ensure the protection of the natural habitat before it could be destroyed by the locals in their search for wood for cooking. Through their efforts, the women were able to protect 2493 acres of the park in which a variety of plants, birds,and other animal species have been able to thrive. Due to their hard work, the Reserve is now the major draw for tourists.\n \nPopenguine is also known for the sighting of the Black Madonna in the reserve. Due to this appearance, an annual pilgrimage to Popenguine takes place in which all the Christians in Senegal and nearby countries visit. The pilgrimage usually takes place around May\/June for any tourists who are interested in witnessing this event. \n\nOver the years, Popenguine has become a very cosmopolitan village. Popenguine is home to a famous Senegalese film director, a local artist (Gade Diouf - ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.afrocentric.faithweb.com Artist's Website"]},"), a Ghanaian author, and Ex-patriots from a variety of countries. Due to the uniqueness of the village, it has come to have all the amenities of a big city while still maintaining the charm and peacefulness of a small village. \n\nPopenguine has also been properly sensibilized, thus, it is one of the few tourist villages in which the tourists are not constantly harassed by the locals. You will rarely hear the locals asking you to give them money, water, or food. You will also rarely hear them call you \"toubab\" (white man). They will actually take the time to greet you and ask for your name. Senegal is the nation of Teranga (hospitality), and the citizens of Popenguine will ensure that tourist will leave believing it to be so. \n\n\nThe dominant ethnic group in this region is Sereer. The most prevalent languages heard in the village are Wolof, Sereer Safin, and French. There are a few locals who speak English as well. \n\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Respect"]},"\n\nThe Senegalese are a very friendly and hospitable group of people.

However, crime against tourists in towns such as Mbour, and Saly is common. Use common sense everywhere in Senegal: keep a close eye on your belongings, watch your pockets in crowded places, women should not walk around alone after dark, try not to wear any outwardly expensive items of clothing or jewelry. There are many different scams to get money from tourists, so be wary. Overall, though, the Senegalese are an incredibly friendly and hospitable people and you will meet many people who are genuinely interested in just talking to you and making sure you are having an enjoyable time in Senegal.\nIn case of emergency, there is a police station and a hospital located in Popenguine. \n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Cap Vert-Thies"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Popenguine"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["14.5575"],["-17.1139"]]}]
