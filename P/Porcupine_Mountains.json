They rise along the south shore of Lake Superior and remain relatively unspoiled.  They are encompassed in Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park which is affectionately known to the locals as \"The Porkies\".  The Porkies is a 60,000 acre park, the largest in the state of Michigan.  Though copper mining and logging occurred in the 1800s, 35,000 acres of the park have never been cut.  Lake Superior borders the park on the northeast, and much of its inland border is made up by the Ottawa National Forest.  It is truly a remote wilderness area. The Porkies have over 100 miles of hiking trails, 25 miles of shoreline, 4 inland lakes, rivers, waterfalls, and old growth hemlock forests.  The Park features four seasons of recreation including hiking, camping, mountain biking, kayaking, swimming, canoeing, fishing, nordic skiing, downhill skiing and snowboarding, snowshoeing, snowmobiling, and hunting.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Ontonagon County Historical Society"]},", 422 River Street, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ontonagonmuseum.org\/"]},".
