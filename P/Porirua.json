Units leave about every half hour. There are express units at peak times, so check the stations that the unit stops at before boarding. All stop at Porirua, but not all go further, and for some the next stop is Plimmerton.\n\nOr from Waikanae, Paraparaumu or Paekakariki stations in the north, not quite as frequent. \n\nAt Porirua the main shopping centre is just across the stream from the main railway station, and buses depart for numerous suburbs. Other stations are Kenepuru in the south (within walking distance of the Kenepuru Hospital and parts of Linden), then north from the city centre in order Paremata (where buses leave for Whitby), Mana, Plimmerton, Pukerua Bay, and Muri.\n\nSuburban trains carry bicycles for an extra adult fare. On the blue \"Ganz\" units, bicycles are stored in the compartment at the south end of each pair of units. On the silver \"Matangi\" units, bicycles are stored in the low floor area in the south car of each pair of units - enter the train through the lime green doors (not the navy blue ones). Note you can't carry your bicycle on Matangi trains during peak times. Wheelchair travel is OK, with train crew happy to get the ramp in place and help you in and out (also at the south end of each pair of Ganz units or the lime green doors on Matangi units).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nInterprovincial buses generally stop at Plimmerton, Paremata, and central Porirua.
