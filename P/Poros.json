Has an area of 33km², a shoreline of 42km and a population of about 3,650.\n\nIn ancient times it was considered the island of Poseidon, god of the sea. This is evident from various literary references and from the traces of the temple of Poseidon, which are to be found in the middle of the island. The word “Poros” in ancient Greek means a small sea passage. Nothing could describe better the island of Poros, since the closest distance between the island and Galatas in the coast of the Peloponnese is 200m. \n\nThe island is divided in two. Kalavria is the bigger part of Poros island and the small one called Sfairia where today is located the town of Poros. \n\nLush pine trees vegetation, crystal clear beaches, a lively waterfront adorned with shops, cosy cafes and restaurants, a picturesque capital (it has been declared protected settlement) with grand traditional mansions and picturesque cobbled streets, as well as a wide selection of entertainment venues are the ingredients of this quiet, yet cosmopolitan, destination that attracts visitors from all age groups.\n\nAs you approach the island of Poros by boat, the historical clock prevails on the hill’s highest peak smothered by prickly pear and pine trees. From here, the view of the port and the coastal areas across is magnificent. Constructed in 1927, it was clearly visible from all angles and is characterized as the main attraction of the city.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Poros aerial viw.jpg"],["thumbnail"],["Aerial view"]]},"\n\nPoros is the isle of serenity and relaxation, where one can enjoy taking romantic strolls.\n\nIt's full of pine trees which reach the shores and sandy beaches. The residents of Poros are no different from other Greek islanders in spontaneity, dignity and hospitality. The large homes on the beach have a neoclassical style in contrast to the common duplex houses in Brinia, Milo, Pounta and Kasteli. The first dwellings were built in 1463 and are located around the famous clock.\n\nIn the centre of the city you can find the town hall, the archaeological museum, a public library along with a reception hall for exhibitions and other cultural events.\n\nMany taverns are sparsely located among the picturesque alleyways and the whitewashed houses of Poros which are surrounded by bougainvillea . Visitors can enjoy souvenir shops, cafeterias, taverns and clubs playing Greek and English music all along the pier.\n\nAlong the coast going towards the training centre, we come across the open air movie theatre \"Diana\" which has premiers of the best films shown this past winter. Right next to it is the exhibition hall of Poros that constantly has exhibitions.\n\nLeaving the centre, you will see the Pregymnasium in the northwest which happens to be Othona's first residence. Today, this area is used for sailors' training and ranking. After passing the field you will come across a small canal separating Sferia from Kalavria.\n\nAfter crossing the canal you will encounter Sinikismos, the first community of Asia Minor refugees. Towards the end of Sinikismos, if you follow the spiral road surrounded by enormous pine trees, you will end up in the church of Our Lady Agia Zoni where festivities take place on 2 July. It's located between a steep cliff with lots of trees and running water where the Temple of Poseidon is also found.\n\nOn your way back to the canal's bridge, towards the left and west, you will see an area called Perlia. The road continues along the coast, passes through Villa Galini and Mikro Neorio and, eventually, reaches Megalo Neorio. Further down is the Love cove, the Russian dockyard along with the islet called Daskalio.\n\nOn the right hand side of the canal's road you will pass through Kanali. Heading east leads you to Askeli. As you continue, the road branches out towards the monastery of Zoodohos Pygi, going north you will reach the temple of Poseidon, Vagionia and passing by Agio Stathi and Profiti Elia it goes back through Sinikismo to the canal.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Panoramica de Poros.JPG"],["thumb"],["Hydrofoil"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Small Ferry.jpg"],["thumb"],["Car ferry"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\nThere are frequent boats between Piraeus and Poros. You can opt for either a slow car ferry (around 2 hours) or a fast catamaran (1h 10m). As of 2007, the cheapest fast option is Euroseas, which has one daily departure at 09:30 (return at 19:00) and sells return tickets for €34. Hellenic Seaways has more frequent sailings (up to half a dozen daily), but also charges more at around €42. Due to the popularity of Hydra, it's possible for some of the Hellenic Seaways boats, which are small, to sell out during peak periods, especially the ones at the most convenient hours. Tickets for all boats may be bought from agencies at the harbour.\n\nThere is a daily service, provided by both ferries, which do the trip in two and a half hours, and by hydrofoil (1 hour), from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Piraeus"]]},", which is 31 nautical miles away. Aegina, Methana, Hydra, Spetses and Ermioni can be reached by the same means, while the \"flying dolphins\" (hydrofoils) also go to Porto Heli, Leonidi, Kyparissi, Monemvasia and Kythira, and in summer in Tolo and Nafplio. Galatas, which is opposite on the shore of the Peloponnese, is reached by ferries and small craft.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nYou will probably arrive by plane to Venizelos, the airport of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Athens"]]},". It has been rebuilt and now offers spacious air-conditioned halls, shopping facilities, several restaurants and Internet Cafés.\n\nFrom Venizelos, there is a shuttle bus (Number X95) going straight to the port of Piraeus (Port no8). The buses are also top of the line, very comfortable and air-conditioned. It makes absolutely no sense to take a cab since it is as fast as the bus but will cost you €40 instead of €30 for the bus ticket. Chances are also very high that the cab driver will overcharge you. Make sure to check the price before you enter any cab! The bus stop “ Karaiskakis Square” is next to Gate 8, from where the ferry boat as well as the hydrofoil boat is leaving for Poros. At Piraeus, you have the choice to the large spacious catamaran ferry or the flying dolphins a hydrofoil ferry to Poros island. Both ferries will bring you there in about one hour. If possible, take the larger catamaran ferry and take your seat at the right-hand side because it offers a better view to the coastline during the trip to Poros. The ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.hsw.gr schedules"]}," for ferry boat and hydrofoil\/ catamaran vary due to season.  \n\nAlternatively you can get a limousine driver to meet you at the airport – or any other meeting place of your choice, and drive you to Poros. The first 100km are on the motorway, and then you will continue on country roads through beautiful scenery via Epidaurus to the village of Galata, from where you will set over to Poros in a private boat in four minutes time.\n“Door to door” this trip takes about 2.5 hours and costs apron €300 depending on number of passengers, including tolls and boat. \n\nSince 2004 there is also the possibility to fly to Poros from the airport by helicopter. The price depends on your luggage.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Helenic Sun Travel"],["alt= Constantinos Alexopoulos"],["url= http:\/\/www.helenicsuntravel.com"],["email="],["address= Askeli, 18020 Poros"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone= +30 6977408518"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Limousines from\/to Venizelos airport"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nThere are public bus connections (KTEL, phone service 14505, in Greek) between Piraeus and Galatas and as well as between Nauplio and Galata.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Mapframe"],["37.5007"],["23.4552"],["zoom=15"],["height=570"],["width=630"],["layer=M"],["staticmap="],["align=none"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Boat ride from Poros to Galatas.jpg"],["thumb"],["Ferry boat"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Poros town alleyway.jpg"],["thumb"],["Walking in town"]]},"\n\nPoros in fact consists of two smaller islands, connected via a small bridge: Sfairia island with Poros town and the pine clad Kalavria island. Together they cover 31km² and have a coastline of 42km. Vigla is its highest peak with an altitude of 358m.\n\nBus and taxi terminals are located in the centre of the beach area. Access to boats that go along the shores of Galata is also available there. Public transportation around the island runs pretty smoothly all day. Buses leave every hour while boats depart every ten minutes. On the beach you can find scooter and bike rentals whereas cars are rented right across the island, in Galata.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\nSmall boats connect Poros with Galata (every 10 minutes), the charming Alikes beach, underneath the Lemon Grove, and - upon demand - Askeli beach.\nThe ferry boat to Galata is connecting the island with the mainland in an hourly rhythm, from 07:10 to 22:10  daily.

With “Neorion Line” you can explore the south west coast line with the beaches of Cochylia, Neorion, Love Bay and the Russian Bay. The “Monastery Line” drives along the south eastern coast with the beaches of Askeli, Panagitsa, and picturesque Monastery beach. The fares are moderate.

In summer schedules are every 30 minutes. Ticket reservation is not necessary.\n\nDriving one's own car within the town itself is not really recommended as the seafront road is narrow and one way only except for mopeds and motorcycles. It is frequently constricted by pick-ups and vans delivering to tavernas and shops (unavoidable) and the thoughtless who will park their car anywhere to avoid walking a few extra yards (eminently avoidable).\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Moto Stelios"],["alt= Motorbike rentals"],["url= http:\/\/steliosrental@yahoo.gr"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone= +30 2298023026"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Stoa F at Kalaureia.jpg"],["thumb"],["Sanctuary of Poseidon"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Poros4.jpg"],["thumb"],["Holy Monastery of Zoodochos Pigi"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Poros12.JPG"],["thumb"],["Russian Naval Base"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Clock Tower"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat= 37.49955"],["long= 23.45227"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=This clock tower was built in 1927 and is an imposing feature.
