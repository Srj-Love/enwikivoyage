The sand is mostly packed but sometimes the winds builds loose drifts and it is easy to get stuck. If you do get stuck, don't panic. Stand outside your car looking dumbfounded by the situation and usually a few burly, macho, half-drunk guys will show up in a few minutes to help push you out. Be sure to shake their hands, thank them and offer them a beer if you've got it.\n\nTo park on the beach requires a beach parking permit available at the Chamber of Commerce and most stores around town. The police patrol the beach looking for problems as well as cars without parking permits.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nThe closest major airport is ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.corpuschristiairport.com\/?fuseaction=main.view&page=185 Corpus Christi International Airport"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nPort Aransas is accessible from the north by ferry across the ship channel. As of May 2008, the ferries are free but there is talk of adding a toll. Between Memorial Day weekend and Labor Day the wait for the ferry can be up to 2 hours from Friday evening through Sunday evening to get on or off the island. During the week during the summer months the wait can still be 45 minutes to an hour during the day. After Labor Day, the waits are usually less than 30 minutes.\n\nThere is a causeway across the ship channel from Corpus Christi to Padre Island that makes getting to Port Aransas easier from the south, especially during the summer. The causeway is part of Park Road 22. The major highway to get there is IH-37 from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Antonio"]]},".
