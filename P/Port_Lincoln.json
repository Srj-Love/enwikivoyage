Flinders was looking for fresh water during his visit, which lasted several weeks.  He eventually located some, which enabled him to continue his voyage into the Spencer Gulf.\n\nHe lost eight of his crew in a rowing boat while going ashore here.  The boat was found but the bodies of the crew never were.  The cape at the tip of Lincoln National Park is called Cape Catastrophe after the event, and the surrounding islands named after each of the lost crewmen.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Climate "]},"\n\nPort Lincoln doesn't get as warm as you may expect during summer, with averages remaining lower than ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Adelaide"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Geography "]},"\n\nPort Lincoln today is a town of around 15,000 people, it has a foreshore area, marina district, and is close to the Lincoln National Park.
