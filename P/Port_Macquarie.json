The main shopping area is located within easy walking distance from this station, and some hostels, hotels and a caravan park are located within a distance that you could walk if have not too much luggage.

Follow this road for about 10 minutes until you see a sign pointing left saying \"Port Macquarie\". Follow this road into town.\n\nThis route takes about 45min to get to Port Macquarie, but it is worth it for the scenery including North Brother Mountain, Middle Rock Beach and The Christmas Bell Plains. A tourist information board is in Kew for you to check this route and confirm it before taking it. You should also avoid taking this road after dark, as it is notorious for wildlife on the road, and numerous accidents have been caused by kangaroos.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nUnfortunately, Port Macquarie does not have a reliable or useful public transport system which can make getting around difficult. While buses may run to most places, they often run at odd times, and terminate early in the day. The most useful bus route is the Shelly Beach - Town Centre route, which seems to run quite regularly, and is the best way of those without a car getting to the beaches and lighthouse. Other than this, don't bother with the public transport, it isn't worth the aggravation.\n\nFortunately, Port Macquarie has a great many places to walk to from the Town Centre.

There are a lot of flying foxes roosting in the trees during the day so while looking up be careful you don't get something dropping in your eye.

This is the short version of the walk. For now, ignore this turn off and carry on and you soon emerge into the eucalypt grove. This is a nice well cared for park with many large eucalypt trees, mainly blackbutt and scribbly gum. You are now on a concrete path and walking in the shade of these trees.\n\nAt the end of the path turn left over another floating bridge and onto the boardwalk which leads you through a paper bark grove. At the end of this path you can turn right to the Wyandra Cresc exit but it's best to turn left now and head back towards town.\n\nYou soon see a path entering from the left. This is  the end of the path that started at the first floating bridge. On your left you can see the sedge land. Carry on a bit further and you see another exit to Wyandra Cresc. Now you are walking through wetland, thank heavens for the boardwalk which is keeping your feet dry. Go up the hill and down the stairs and you are in wetland again.\n\nThe next exit on the right follows the creek and doubles back to enter  the historical cemetery, but it's best if you carry on over the bridge. As you loop round to the left you can see the historical cemetery up the hill on your right. Go on a bit further and you see set of stairs on your right which lead up to the historical cemetery. If you keep going you soon see the Mangrove Walk on the left. Take this turn and go along to the second bird hide on the left. This gives a very good view of the water.\n\nContinue on the walk now and emerge in the arboretum. This is a park containing many native trees and all are labelled. You will notice you can now hear the traffic again. Over in the north east corner of the arboretum is a toilet block and behind that is a large display showing a map of the park and giving details of the flora and fauna therein.
