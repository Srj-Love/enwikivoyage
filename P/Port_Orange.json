During Florida’s plantation period, Patrick Dean was granted 995 acres in 1804 from the Spanish Crown which later was named the Dunlawton Plantation. The fertile soil was favorable for citrus, indigo, and sugar cane which could be shipped to market on the Halifax River. The plantation was destroyed by the Seminole indians during the Second Seminole War in 1836. The Dunlawton Sugar Mill on Old Sugar Mill Road is the last remnant of the old plantation.\n\nThe second major era for Port Orange occurred after the Civil War. Dr. John Milton Hawks, an abolitionist and United States Army Surgeon, along with other Union Army officers formed the Florida Land and Lumber Company and brought 500 freed slaves to public lands along the Halifax River, north of Spruce Creek in 1866. Dr. Hawks moved the settlement he was credited with naming ",{"type":"''","value":["Orange Port"]}," in February 1867 from the Mosquito Inlet (Ponce Inlet) to where the community lies today. By April 1867, the settlement’s name change to Port Orange because another town in the United States already had the former name. Port Orange was incorporated in 1926. \n\nPort Orange is made up of some 150 distinct \"neighborhoods\", each with it's own distinctive flavor. The City encompasses 26.4 square miles speckled with beautiful parks and is home to over 50,000 residents.\n\nOne of the largest annual events in Volusia is Port Orange Family Days held in October. This four-day festival which takes place at the City Center Complex focuses on celebration of family and quality of life in Port Orange and features a carnival, business and non-profit expo, children’s games, parade, food court and entertainment.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Volusia-florida.jpg"],["thumb"],["Map of Port Orange, relative to Volusia County and Florida, with locations of nearby Cities."]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nPort Orange only offers Spruce Creek Airport, a small private airport, which is part of the Spruce Creek Fly-In real estate community.
