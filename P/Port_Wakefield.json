He reached the head of the gulf in 1802, and named the gulf it after Admiral Lord St Vincent.\n\nThe town was selected a ideal for a port for the movement of copper, and huge quantities of ore passed through the town in the mid 19th century.  However, the railway line reached the area around 10 years after the port was established, and the transport of copper mainly switched to rail.  There was some continuing use of the port for agriculture, but Port Wakefield became an agricultural service town during the 20th century, with a small but developing tourism industry.\n\nMany know Port Wakefield today as a road stop on the highway out of Adelaide towards ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Port Augusta"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yorke Peninsula"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Eyre Peninsula"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Flinders Ranges"]]},", the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Outback"],["Outback (South Australia)"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Northern Territory"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Western Australia"]]},".
