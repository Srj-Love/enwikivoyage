[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Disambiguation banner.png"]]},"\n__NOTOC__\nThere is more than one place called ",{"type":"'''","value":["Portage"]},", or with \"portage\" as part of its name. Historically, a portage is a place where travellers would carry their canoes and cargo around rapids or from one waterway to another. The word is derived from the French verb ",{"type":"''","value":["porter"]}," meaning \"to carry\"; several other words which occur in both French and English, such as \"portable\" and \"portmanteau\", are from the same root.\n\nThere are dozens of portages from the old fur trade routes, used by ",{"type":"[[","value":[["voyageurs"]]}," (French for travellers) mainly based in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Montreal"]]},", all over Western Canada and the Northwestern US. Not all of them have \"portage\" in the name; for example ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sault Sainte Marie (Ontario)"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sault Sainte Marie (Michigan)"]]}," are at an old portage, but the word \"sault\" describes the rapids there; a literal translation is \"leap\".\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:The Portage by Winslow Homer 1897.jpeg"],["thumb"],["350px"],["\"The Portage\", Winslow Homer, 1897"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Canada"]]}," "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Portage la Prairie"]]},", often abbreviated to just \"Portage\", a city in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Manitoba"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" Portage Avenue is a major street in downtown ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Winnipeg"]]},"; the corner of Portage & Main is generally considered the center of the city"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Zealand"]]}," "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The area that is now ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Auckland"]]}," had Maori portage routes between the Tasman Sea and Pacific ocean.
