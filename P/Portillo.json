With an extraordinary skiable terrain, natural beauty and numerous facilities and apres ski activities, Portillo is a tourist destination for all ages.

Although very possible for adventurous travelers, it's not generally recommended. Critics of this money saving activity argue that the tickets are less expensive than in the US  and on par with Europe. They also call skiing without a ticket \"stealing\", a description budget travelers find preposterous and wrong in every important way.
