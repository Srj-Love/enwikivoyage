The largest city in the state of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oregon"]]},", Portland's residents are proud of their city nearly to a fault, which continues to draw people due to its scenic beauty, great outdoors environment, excellent microbreweries, and eco-friendly urban planning policies, as well as a reputation for colorful characters and a proudly liberal outlook, with an attitude to match.\n\nLying about 70 mi (124 km) from the Pacific Coast on Oregon's northern border, the city straddles the Willamette (pronounced will-LAM-ett) River south of its confluence with the Columbia River. To the east, the majestic ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mount Hood"]]}," forms the perfect backdrop for Portland's skyline. The mild, wet climate makes this a very green city, and Portland has taken full advantage of this with a wealth of parks and gardens that make the city one of the most beautiful in the country.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Portland panorama3.jpg"],["thumb"],["450px"],["The Willamette River runs by Downtown Portland"]]},"\n\nPortland is the largest city lying between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Francisco"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Seattle"]]},", but when compared to those cities, Portland's environment is not as fast-paced. It hasn't yet developed to the point of being overwhelming. Instead, it has a more laid-back, small-city feel.\n\nThat being said, nearly 600,000 people live in Portland proper, and many more live in the suburbs. As such, Portland has its fair share of amenities, including an impressive music and arts scene and one of the largest collections of zine and independent publishers of any city in the nation. Its relatively large population also means it has some of the worst traffic congestion in the American West, a fairly high cost of living relative to wages, and chronic underemployment.\n\nThe city has a lovely blend of historic and modern architecture and many lush parks to poke your toes into. Forest Park and Washington Park in the hills west of Downtown offer a variety of plants, trails, and wildlife near the city. Vistas of Mount Hood and the Willamette River, stately Douglas-fir trees (Oregon's official state tree), and roses and trees at every turn give the city stunning seasonal color.\n\nEnvironmentally friendly practices, such as recycling and an extensive public transportation system, are part of the culture and fuel many progressive city planning practices. Portland metro, like all Oregon urban centers, is surrounded by an urban growth boundary. This keeps sprawl in check and helps to make Portland a relatively compact city. Unlike most similarly sized metropolitan areas in the country, you can drive about 15 mi (24 km) from Downtown in just about any direction and be out in the countryside.\n\nPortland is a very fun and welcoming city for LGBT travelers. It has one of the largest and most integrated gay and lesbian communities in the United States, supported by two major LGBT publications and other queer-friendly media.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nThe first European contact in the area came from none other than Lewis and Clark, who sailed along the Columbia River just north of where Portland lies today in 1805; after a year of exploration they finally reached the Pacific Ocean just to the west. The reports from their expedition fueled interest in the area, and settlers came to stake their claim. Two of those settlers were William Overton and his friend Asa Lovejoy, a lawyer from Boston, who came across the spot where Portland now sits and jointly began to build a settlement. Later, Overton sold his share to F. W. Pettygrove, a man from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Portland (Maine)"],["Portland, Maine"]]},". As of this point, the area was being transformed from a small stopping point between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oregon City"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vancouver (Washington)"],["Vancouver, Washington"]]}," to a formal settlement, and the owners now needed to give it a name. Both Lovejoy and Pettygrove wanted to name the new town after their respective hometowns; so in 1845 they decided to leave it up to a coin toss and Pettygrove won two times out of three.\n\nIn 1851, Portland was formally incorporated and was growing rapidly; its proximity to the rivers, which funneled a trade with San Francisco to the south, combined by the local fishing, lumber, and agriculture industries fueled Portland's early growth. The railroad arrived in the 1880s, and for a time Portland was the largest city on the west coast north of San Francisco; however the Klondike Gold Rush and the arrival of the railroad to Washington state meant Seattle quickly eclipsed Portland's growth.\n\nPortland persisted as a booming railroad, lumber and steel town for several decades. During the 1970s, however, Portland began to gain a reputation for progressive urban planning practices, adopting policies such as an urban growth boundary and constructing new parks in a push to maintain the central neighborhoods as active places in light of suburban development. Through the 70s and into the 80s, Portland became a center for \"counter-culture,\" growing into a hub for punk and indie rock music, zine publishing, and activist movements. The dot-com boom of the 90s brought an influx of modern tech companies along with the so-called \"creative class\", who remained even after the economic bubble burst. By this point, the city's progressive policies and politics had won the city a special status among urban designers, environmentalists, and political activists as a very forward-thinking city, which has only fueled further growth and development of the metropolitan area.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Imperial"],["janhigh = 45"],["febhigh = 50"],["marhigh = 56"],["aprhigh = 61"],["mayhigh = 68"],["junhigh = 73"],["julhigh = 80"],["aughigh = 79"],["sephigh = 74"],["octhigh = 64"],["novhigh = 52"],["dechigh = 46"],["janlow = 34"],["feblow = 36"],["marlow = 39"],["aprlow = 42"],["maylow = 48"],["junlow = 53"],["jullow = 57"],["auglow = 57"],["seplow = 52"],["octlow = 46"],["novlow = 40"],["declow = 36"],["janprecip = 5.4"],["febprecip = 4.1"],["marprecip = 3.7"],["aprprecip = 2.5"],["mayprecip = 2.0"],["junprecip = 1.6"],["julprecip = 0.5"],["augprecip = 0.9"],["sepprecip = 1.6"],["octprecip = 3.1"],["novprecip = 5.5"],["decprecip = 6.5"],["jansun ="],["febsun ="],["marsun ="],["aprsun ="],["maysun ="],["junsun ="],["julsun ="],["augsun ="],["sepsun ="],["octsun ="],["novsun ="],["decsun ="],["janh2o ="],["febh2o ="],["marh2o ="],["aprh2o ="],["mayh2o ="],["junh2o ="],["julh2o ="],["augh2o ="],["seph2o ="],["octh2o ="],["novh2o ="],["dech2o ="],["description = ",{"type":"{{","value":[["ForecastNOAA"],["Portland"],["45.51188"],["-122.67557"]]}]]},"\n\nIt's said that there are only two seasons in the Portland area: rain and summer. When the summer comes, the clouds suddenly clear and it's hot and sunny, and often quite pleasant. Any given day in July through September has only a 10% chance of rain, and temperatures rarely exceed 85°F (29°C) degrees or so, although it does occasionally hit 100°F (38°C) in July and August.\n\nDespite the nice summers, Portland is really known for its rain, which comes between late September and late June. It is more often a menacing drizzle or mist than a downpour, though. There's a myth that most Portlanders don't use, or even believe in, umbrellas, and instead prefer hoods and raincoats. This has a grain of truth to it, but any stroll through Portland on a rainy day will prove to you that people are not shy about using umbrellas. You shouldn't be shy, either — if it's not summer and you don't want to get wet, pack your umbrella.\n\nSnow is very uncommon because Portland's elevation is fairly low. A sunny day in the rainy season is not typical, but the sun does come out occasionally. The moment it does, some Portlanders have the unusual habit of wearing summer clothing, even if it's still somewhat chilly.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Tourist information"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Portland Visitor Information and Services Center"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.travelportland.com"],["email="],["address=701 SW 6th Ave"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=at Morrison"],["phone=+1 503 275-8355"],["tollfree=+1-877-678-5263"],["fax="],["hours=M-F 8:30AM-5:30PM, Sa 10AM-4PM"],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Portland International Airport Concourse D - Oregon.JPG"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Portland International Airport"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.portofportland.com\/PDX_Home.aspx Portland International Airport"]}]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["PDX"]]},") is 9 mi (15 km) northeast of downtown, near the Columbia River.

Portland is divided into five sectors, sometimes referred to oxymoronically as the \"five quadrants\". These quadrants are roughly divided by Burnside Street between north\/south and the Willamette River between east\/west, with a fifth sector (North) between the Willamette River and Williams Avenue.

In fact, many of the traffic lights, both downtown and inner-Portland, seem to be timed, expecting bicycle-like speeds.\n\nBe aware that most of the city (and everything near downtown) is along the northerly flowing Willamette River, and not the much larger Columbia which flows west.
