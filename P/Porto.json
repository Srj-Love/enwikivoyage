The city itself isn't very populous (about 240,000 inhabitants), but the Porto metropolitan area (Greater Porto) has some 1,500,000 inhabitants in a 50 km radius, with cities like Gaia, Matosinhos, Maia, Gondomar, and Espinho.\n\nThe city was built along the hills overlooking the Douro river estuary, and its historical center was awarded ",{"type":"[[","value":[["UNESCO World Heritage List"],["World Heritage status"]]}," by UNESCO in 1996. It has been continuously inhabited since at least the 4th Century, when the Romans referred to it as ",{"type":"''","value":["Portus Calle"]},".\n\nPorto has a semi-Mediterranean climate, although it's strongly affected by the Atlantic ocean, which makes it's cooler than other cities with this climate. Temperatures can rise as high as 40°C in August during occasional heat waves. Winters are mild and humid, with occasional cold nights when temperatures can drop below 0°C.\n\nPorto has always been a mercantile city. This is evident in the style of the buildings lining the ",{"type":"''","value":["Avenida dos Aliados"]},", the core of the downtown area. The center of town, unlike other major Portuguese cities, which tend towards the baroque, is granite and monumental.\n\nResidents of Porto are nicknamed the ",{"type":"''","value":["Tripeiros"]},", or tripe eaters. This is based on the legend of the city's inhabitants going without meat in order to provision the fleet (which left from Porto) that left to conquer Ceuta in North Africa in 1415. As the story goes, they had to subsist on tripe soup, which is a specialty of the city.\n\nCitizens of Porto, while definitely Portuguese, hold themselves apart culturally from the rest of the country, as is expressed in the often heard phrase \"o Porto é uma nação\" (Porto is a nation). Outsiders often consider Porto to be more crass and mercantile than the rest of the country, and the inhabitants to be somewhat lacking in social graces. This is likely because the city has historically been dominated by Portuguese bourgeoisie and English trading factions rather than the nobility. The ",{"type":"''","value":["Portuenses"]},", to use the correct term for the inhabitants, of course disagree, regarding themselves with some justification as being the economic heart of the nation. As the saying goes, \"Porto works, Braga Prays, Coimbra studies, and Lisbon gets the money.\"\n\nThe city is officially styled \"a muito nobre, sempre leal e invicta cidade do Porto\" (the very noble, always faithful, and invincible city of Porto). This is usually shortened to \"a Cidade Invicta\" (the invincible city) a title won because of Porto's unparalleled resistance against Napoleonic troops during the Peninsular war.\n\nThe city is quite varied architecturally, with medieval as well as modern living side by side. Porto's geography is hard on the feet, but pleasant to the eye. The city is extremely hilly, with many buildings built into a cliff face that overlooks the river. Stairs cut into the stone run up and down the cliff face and offer a laborious but rewarding walking tour. Across the river from Porto proper, in the suburb of Gaia, are located the warehouses of notable Porto wine companies, such as Cálem, Ferreira, Fonseca, Sandeman, Kopke and others.\n\nWhile the local attitude is friendly, to outsiders it is worth noting that locals can respond literally to questions, which may seem slightly off-putting to the uninitiated. An example of this would be to ask in a bar if they have a menu (for food) and to receive a straight 'no' as a response. It's after further questions that one can find out that the establishment doesn't sell food. Such a response is not considered rude, it is merely direct and literal.\n\nIf you speak in Spanish to a local, you will be largely understood and as a rule they will freely converse with you, but from time to time, more so with the older generation, you may be politely reminded that you are in Portugal and the native language is Portuguese.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:PortoW.jpg"],["thumb"],["400px"],["North side of Douro"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Sá Carneiro Airport"]},", (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["OPO"]]},"), Pedras Rubras, Maia (+351) 229 432 400, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.porto-airport.com"]},".

Trains from and to Madrid and Paris are regular, other non-domestic destinations vary according to demand and time of year.\n\nBe careful on the train from Madrid. On at least one route, the computer systems will say you need to change trains at Guillarei in northern Spain. However, Guillarei has stopped trains through Portugal since 2004. Instead, you will need to transfer to a station named Tui which is a few miles from Guillarei. The computer system hasn't been updated even though this change occurred in 2004 for some reason. You can go into Guillarei but you will need to take a taxi (cost €5) to Tui to connect.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nThe city is served by five major highways: A1, which connects Porto to Lisbon, A29 which connects Porto to Aveiro, A3 connects Porto to Braga, A28 connects Porto to Viana do Castelo and the northern Portuguese border, and A4, which goes eastwards from the city towards Vila Real. The IC29 connects Porto to the neighboring city of Gondomar.\nThe city is also served by 2 ring highways, the A41 (still incomplete) which is the outer ring, and VCI\/IC23 or A20 which connects all the main places inside the city. \nThe A20\/VCI, A28, A29 and A41 are all free highways at the moment, but there are plans to install tolls in the latter three, sometime in the future.\nGenerally speaking, the traffic is usually chaotic and very intense, especially during rush hours.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nThere are many companies providing direct bus trips from major European countries and also for most of the northern cities of the country.

Modest-sized cruise ships can dock just outside a drawbridge to the inner harbor.  Beneath the south approach to the bridge is a station for the light rail system (see \"By Metro\" below) that goes to Oporto.\n\nThere is also a very small recreational harbor in the river Douro.  As far as a major method of getting to the city, however, sea transport is not really feasible. However, you can use tour boats based along the river (especially in Oporto) to go up the Douro River, one of the most scenic short trips you'll ever make.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:PortoValley.jpg"],["thumb"],["Porto Valley"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nPorto, like most Portuguese cities, is a nightmare to drive in. Roads vary in conditions - from fully paved to cobbled lanes that can make even the most shortest of distance seem like a go-kart rally. With that said, keep in mind that the touristic part of the city (the Ribeira and Baixa) are a never ending maze of narrow streets, short tempered drivers and snakelike alleys. Better to walk (despite the fact that it's very hilly). Also, drivers seem to have forgotten how to drive (apart from pushing the pedals) - therefore, they make their own rules of the road (however, this generally does not apply to young drivers). Be prepared to lose your patience several times whilst driving.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By metro"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.metrodoporto.pt\/ Porto Metro"]}]}," is an incredibly advanced, state of the art light rail \/ subway system. Developed in 2001 (for the Porto2001 - European Capital of Culture), the metro is still under construction. It has 5 lines, that run across the center of Porto, and down to some suburban areas. It is quick, and probably the most efficient way to get around Porto. Some major areas of the city, however, are not that well served by the metro, although new lines are planned and should start being built soon.\n\nTickets must be purchased beforehand. They can be sold at the machines in the station (note: if there are no tickets in the machine that day, take the metro to the next station and buy it there!). The ticket is printed in a card called \"Andante\", and you can purchase as many rides (or travels) you want. Andante is Porto's main ticket system and it is based on somewhat unusual zone system ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/transportespublicos.pt\/PT\/?glossary=andante&lang=en"]},". The city centre is zone C1 and the airport is N10. To travel between places you need to know how many zones you need to cross. Within the same zone or up to another zone you buy Z2 ticket. Z3 for three zones and so on. If you plan on using it again, ",{"type":"''","value":["Do Not throw away the card!"]}," The card can be re-charged (the card itself costs around €0.50). You can also buy daily passes, which may be more convenient.\n\nIf you plan on staying for more than three weeks, it is recommended you get the \"Andante Gold\", Andante's monthly subscription. The card costs €5, and will allow unlimited travel with your chosen zones. The Andante Gold, like the Andante Blue can be used in all metro lines, the funicular and all buses . When you are buying the Andante Gold, you must have a picture of yourself (your passport photo will do. They can amplify the image from the passport to the card in seconds).\n\nAn important note: your andante must be validated before you enter the metro, bus or funicular. There are no barriers to stop you at the metro, but the Metro police enter the cars and check your Andante to make sure you have validated it, and are travelling within your zones.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.stcp.pt\/en\/travel\/ STCP"]}]}," is the best way to move around if you don't want to waste money on taxis. It's the public bus operator in the region, and the only one operating inside city borders. Suburbs are served either by STCP or private companies. STCP buses are the largest eco-friendly fleet in Europe, modern, comfortable, and lines cover the entire city, as well as major suburbs.\nBuses colors are white and blue. Line numbers are a 3-digit code. First digit is assigned according to the destination zone (2-west porto, 3-north porto, 4-east porto, 5-matosinhos, 6-maia, 7-valongo, 8-gondomar, 9-vila nova de gaia). For example, line nr. 906 has its destination in vila nova de gaia (9).\nYou can use two kind of tickets: Andante (see \"Metro\" above) or STCP own tickets. Andante tickets are recommended: you can also use them on metro and suburban trains, plus they're easier to buy and recharge on any metro station or newspaper seller with \"payshop\" symbol. Andante blue card costs €0.50 and can be charged with how many journeys you like.\nEvery bus stop has at least a timetable and lines served. There's also a code so you can get a (paid) SMS showing minutes left to next arrivals updated in real time. The busiest ones have electronic displays with timetables and city maps. Every bus inside has a display showing the name of next stop, so it's easy to keep track of them.\n\nRoute 500 ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/transportespublicos.pt\/PT\/?glossary=stcp-linha-500&lang=en"]}," is probably the most scenic STCP route as it runs along the river and the ocean front.

Note that, unlike the other river side cafes in the city, these establishments do not have picturesque views of Porto (that's expensive, and in the end, you'd be the one paying for that bill). Instead, they attract tourists by offering good food at very cheap prices.\n\nMost locals drink black coffee (espresso).\n\nThere is at least one fully vegetarian restaurant in Porto, Paladar da Alma (Rua de Santo Ildefonso 293\/5), and some other restaurants which offer vegetarian dishes alongside non-vegetarian options, such as Capa Verde (Rua da Nossa Senhora de Fátima).
