The building, built in the sixteenth century, preserves the facade in Renaissance style of the past.  The building housed the Spanish rulers, and at the opposite end of the square on the side that looks towards the sea, is the fifteenth bastion of Santa Barbara. \n\nWorthy of note is the Giardino Corsini, in which there are many rare tropical and subtropical botanicals. \n\nThe country is dominated by the mighty fortress Aldobrandesca, a fortification built on several occasions between the Middle Ages and the Renaissance around existing structures.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nThere are many places where someone can eat in Porto Ercole. However, being in Italy, I usually prefer to go and eat a good pizza. My favorite place is ",{"type":"''","value":["il forno del porto"]}," which does many diffrent types of freshly baked pizzaz, bread and cakes. Cakes can be asked to be made for someone in specific. Next to the pizza shop is another pizza shop, and I enjoy both equally, but a warning. These places are usually packed during the summer from 10am to 1230pm.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["42.3833"],["11.2000"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Grosseto (province)"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Porto Ercole"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Porto Ercole"]]}]
