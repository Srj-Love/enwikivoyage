Portsmouth plays a major role in British history, especially naval history. Its rich heritage offers a variety of attractions, including the Historical Dockyard, which houses some of the most historical warships in the world – HMS ",{"type":"''","value":["Victory"]},", Lord Nelson's flagship used at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, and the ",{"type":"''","value":["Mary Rose"]},", a Tudor-era warship. Portsmouth has two cathedrals, including the Romanesque-style Portsmouth Cathedral, twelve museums, most of which are free, and two theatres. The City offers excellent shopping facilities in the Gunwharf Quays complex, home to a variety of designer stores including Ralph Lauren, Hugo Boss and Barbour, as well as the striking 557 ft landmark Spinnaker Tower, which offers excellent views of the Solent and City.\n\nPortsmouth is also known for its literary history, as the birthplace of Charles Dickens, the famous Victorian era novelist, and the pioneering engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Other famous figures to have lived here are HG Wells, Arthur Conan Doyle and Rudyard Kipling. The city is well served by three musical venues, The Wedgewood Rooms, Guildhall and Pyramids, which regularly host major musical and comedy acts.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThe majority of the city of Portsmouth lies on Portsea Island, though it is separated from the mainland only by a roughly 30 m wide stretch of sea water, so is perhaps more accurately thought of as a peninsula. Historically, Portsmouth has long been an important naval port and builds on its rich heritage with memorials, museums, trails and the fascinating Historic Dockyard. It has four miles of seafront, including pebbled beaches. It is a university city, home to the University of Portsmouth, and has a large multicultural student population.\n\nPortsmouth has a population of 200,000 people and is the most densely populated city in the UK, outside of certain parts of London. The entire Portsmouth Urban Area is home to more than 442,000 people.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.nationalrail.co.uk\/ National Rail"]}," trains run frequently from Waterloo Station in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]}," and take between 1 h 30 min and 1 h 40 min via Haslemere, or about 2 h 10 min via ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Winchester (England)"],["Winchester"]]}," (you may arrive earlier by taking a later train via Haslemere than going via Winchester). A cheap day single is about £33. Other major services include ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brighton (England)"],["Brighton"]]}," (1 h 40 min), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cardiff"]]}," (3 h 10 min) via ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bath (England)"],["Bath"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bristol"]]},"; and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southampton"]]}," (1 hour). There are also direct trains from Gatwick Airport (1 h 20 min).\n\nAlight at Portsmouth Harbour station for the Historic Dockyard, Gunwharf Quays, the Spinnaker Tower and ferries to the Isle of Wight. Alight at Portsmouth & Southsea station for Portsmouth City Centre shopping, Portsmouth Guildhall and a short walk to the seafront. Alight at Fratton station for Fratton Park football stadium. Hilsea station is situated in the north east of the city - it's sited to serve the local industrial estates and most visitors would have no reason to alight here unless they are visiting Portsmouth Rugby Club. Note that some trains do not stop at this station.\n\nWhen departing by train those unfamiliar with the stations can easily miss them even when only a few feet away. Portsmouth Harbour is behind the bus station at The Hard. Portsmouth & Southsea is easily found at the bottom of Commercial Road if you look out for the railway bridge just south of the building. Fratton can be found to the east of the road bridge at the bottom of Fratton Road and north of the roundabout between Victoria Road North and Goldsmith Avenue. The less frequented Hilsea Station is underneath the road bridge at Norway Road and Cosham station is on the Cosham High Street.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nPortsmouth is easily accessible by car via the M275 via the M27 and A27. From London, take the A3 or M3 south. As Portsmouth is an island city, routes in and out are limited, and so congestion can be a problem, especially during rush hour. Be advised that the large majority of residential roads have a 20mph speed limit.\n\nParking is plentiful both on street (about £1\/hr) and in pay-and-display car parks. The city centre and Gunwharf Quays both have multi-storey car parks, and Southsea has on-street parking. Note that some roads have a time limit on parking for non-residents and these limits are enforceable 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\nIf you stroll a little away from the city centre and tourist hot spots (sometimes just around the corner in Southsea), parking can be found for free or in time-limited bays.\n\nMotorcycles can park without a residents permit and within the marked bays. Gunwharf Quays also has a dedicated motorcycle bay in the underground car park.\n\nIf you're visiting the University, you can obtain day car passes from University House. However, the car parks are very busy during term-time.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nLocal bus routes stretch as far afield as Havant and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southampton"]]},". Day passes can be bought for £3.70 which allow unlimited travel in the Portsmouth City area or £4.80 for the whole of Hampshire.\n\nNational Express travels into the Hard (few hundred yards from harbour and historic dockyard) with links to many of the country's major cities.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\nThere are ferry services from four ports in France and Bilbao in Spain.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Saint-Malo"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":["Brittany Ferries, up to 2 a day, 9 h ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.brittanyferries.com\/"]}]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Cherbourg"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":["Condor Ferries, 1 Sunday service, 5 h ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.condorferries.co.uk\/"]}]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":["Brittany Ferries, up to 2 a day, h (Mar-Nov only) "]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Caen"]]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":["Brittany Ferries, 3 a day, 5 h 45 min (year-round service)"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":["Brittany Ferries, 1 a day, 3h 30 min (summer-only fast service F-Su)"]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Le Havre"]]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":["LD Lines, 1 a day, 8 h overnight ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ldlines.co.uk\/services-portsmouth-le-havre.html"]}]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Bilbao"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":["P&O Ferries, 2 a week, 35 h"]}]},"\nThere are services to the Channel Islands of Jersey and Guernsey.\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Guernsey"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":["Condor Ferries, 1 a day, 6h 30min"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Jersey"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":["Condor Ferries, 1 a day, 10h 30min"]}]},"\nThe ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Isle of Wight"]]}," is under 60 min by ferry or 10 min by hovercraft.\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Fishbourne"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":["Wightlink, half-hourly during day, 35 min ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.wightlink.co.uk\/"]}]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Ryde"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":["Wightlink, half-hourly during day, 15 min"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":[" The hovercraft is every 15 min from Southsea seafront, operated by ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.hovertravel.co.uk\/ Hovertravel"]},"."]}]},"\nThe ferry to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gosport"]]}," (for Submarine and Explosion museums) runs every 7 min at peak times and every 15 min at other times until midnight for £2.90 return.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nThe nearest airport is ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.southamptonairport.com\/ Southampton Airport"]}]},", around 20 mi from Portsmouth in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Eastleigh (Hampshire)"],["Eastleigh"]]},".
