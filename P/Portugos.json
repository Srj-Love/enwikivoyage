It's architecture is traditional Berber style, flat roofed houses scattered in a maze of narrow twisting streets, each corner adorned with bright potted flowers and dazzling red peppers hung out to dry.  It is one of the more authentically Spanish villages of the area and you would be unlikely to meet any but its Spanish inhabitants whilst strolling through its labyrinthine streets.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nMost visitors to the area would arrive in a car - hired or otherwise.  It is possible to catch the bus from Granada and Orgiva.

There is a parking area with picnic tables etc., a small chapel, or 'Ermita', and a spring from which emerges health restoring but sour tasting water.  Below this there is a small gorge, where you can see how the iron in the water has stained the surrounding rock faces orange.  A set of steps has been made down into the gorge.\n\nA trek up from the village (90 minutes walking or you can drive if you take the track by the 'Farmacia') will lead you to the ",{"type":"'''","value":["'Junto de Los Rios"]},"' and the 'Area Recreativa de Pórtugos.'  This is a beautiful spot where two rivers meet and make an impressive waterfall.\n\n\nA picnic area with tables and barbeque zones have been created and some steps now lead down to the foot of the waterfall.  Impressive views from here across the valley.\n\nAlso, Pórtugos has three main ",{"type":"'''","value":["fiestas"]},": a cultural one during the first week of August where local arts including dramatic presentations are displayed - of particular interest is the demonstration of 'La Parva' where a mule can be seen threshing the wheat as in time gone by; a religious one early in October when the Virgin Rosario is taken from her place in the Ermita and paraded around the streets - accompanied by a phenomenal number of fireworks considering the small population of this village; and another for San Sebastian in January.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nThis is an excellent place to base yourself for a walking holiday since it is situated in the high Alpujarras, on the lower slopes of the summit of Mulhacen, the highest peak on the Iberian Peninsula.  There are countless well signposted footpaths that pass the village, giving every level of walking challenge, from severe high level treks to gentle meandering from village to village along sympathetic mule tracks.  If you are attracted to the high Alpujarras but want to avoid the concentration of tourism that can be found in either Trevelez or the villages of the Poqueira Gorge - Pampaneira, Bubión, Capileira - then Pórtugos is a good choice.  During your stay it is still very possible you will find yourself the only non-Spanish visitor.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Cortijo Opazo"],["url=http:\/\/www.cortijoopazo.com"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=For a self catering walking holiday this is an ideal base.
