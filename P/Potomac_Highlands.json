This region is filled with hills and mountains that provide remarkable beauty, but at the same time make travel by land difficult.  Counties that seem very close on a map are much more distant as far as travel time, and some areas in West Virginia are more closely related and connected to nearby cities in neighboring states.  For example, the Appalachian Mountains and I-81 (this region's only interstate highway) keep Martinsburg, WV more closely connected to Hagerstown, MD than Berkely, Springs, WV.  However, this lack of interstate highways provides for more relaxed, scenic travel along smaller highways and county roads.\n\nOne of the best ways to experience the Potomac Highlands is to leave the main roads behind and travel along the more local roads.  They provide spectacular off the beaten path views or winding roads clinging to pristine creeks and rivers.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Itineraries"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nBe careful while driving on mountain roads.  The weather can be unpredictable and can change very quickly.  The current weather may be fine in the valley, but the weather in higher elevations can be much different.  Rain, snow, fog, and high winds can catch you off guard when you reach the top of a local mountain in the Potomac Highlands, and windy roads can combine with treacherous weather to create difficult driving.  Additionally, high winds and just a small snowfall may create large snowdrifts.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["West Virginia"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Potomac Highlands of West Virginia"]]}]
