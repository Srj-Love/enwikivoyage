It soon became one of the wealthiest and largest cites in the Americas.   The mines of the Cerro Rico are the richest mines in all of world history and may have produced 60,000 tons of silver.  The name Potosi was adopted by San Luis de Potosi in Mexico to reflect their hopes for equal riches.  It is reputed that at one time mules were shoed with silver due to the difficulty of getting supplies of iron to the city.  Some of this wealth was used to build magnificent baroque churches (UNESCO listed sites) and monasteries.  Millions of indigenous labourers and African slaves perished in mines in the three centuries of colonial rule. Estimates range from 2 million at the low end to 8 million at the upper end.  The miners were often below ground for weeks at a time. In 1800 the silver mines were depleted and tin became the major ore mined.  Recently they are mining rare earths.  All of this lead to a slow economic decline.   \n\nThe wealthy history of Potosí is still reflected in the narrow streets, colonial mansions and the many churches, which makes the city a UNESCO World Heritage List\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nFrom the bus terminal it's a 30 minute walk uphill to the city center.

It's a shocking experience as the methods of working haven't changed much since the colonial times. Working conditions are terrible: most miners die of silicosis in their forties. Still, many people don't have another choice and around 10,000 people work in the mines. A tour starts with a visit to the miners' market to buy gifts for the miners like coca leaves, drinks, cigarettes or dynamite. You will then visit an ore refinery plant where the miners sell whatever deposits they manage to collect. Then you head to the mines, where a typical visit will have you walking and crawling through it for about 2~3 hours. You can talk, take photographs and share your gifts with the miners.\n\nTaking a tour of one of the cooperative mines is still a good way to get a sense of the social price paid for the mineral wealth of the few. The dust is supposed to contain silicon that leads to silicosis (wear a disposable mask!) among the miners. Water dropping from the walls and ceiling is said to contain arsenic and cyanide. You can see asbestos fibers in the rock walls. Many of the mine props are snapped and on my tour in 2003 there was a minor ceiling cave-in that forced us to wait a bit before being able to exit the mine. One very interesting aspect of the mine was the little side chamber near the entrance to the mine that contained a statue of \"El Tio,\" a diabolic figure that the miners make offerings to. They say that God may rule aboveground, but that El Tio is in charge down below.\n\nThere are many tour agencies in Potosí offering this tour, shop around before buying. The price is around 100bs for koala tours. Koala Tours, one of the oldest tour agencies, offers the tour for this price, for example. Koala Tours allow you to let off your own stick of dynamite on request!\nGreengo tours is 80bs. The ex-miners offer loads of information about the (history of the) mine. They don't do explosions just for tourists, but for the sake of the mine.\n\nHostal La Casona Potosi also offers safe visits to Cerro Rico.\n\nPeople with claustrophobic tendencies, be wary, Silver Mine Tours 28\/01\/10, takes you deep into the guts of this rabbit warren of a mine.
