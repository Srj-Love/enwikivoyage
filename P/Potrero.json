A great place to eat breakfast, lunch, or dinner and catch a glimpse of the authentic Costa Rican lifestyle.  A simple, rancho style building with large Guanacaste tree trunk tables, and well landscaped with native tropical plants.  Very popular among locals and tourists alike, and it is not uncommon to see Howler Monkeys playing in the mango trees that surround the restaurant. Specializes in seafood. Try the whole red snapper or grilled mahi mahi.  The generous portions, excellent prices, accommodating, friendly, English speaking family make Sol y Mar the gastronomic gem of Guanacaste.
