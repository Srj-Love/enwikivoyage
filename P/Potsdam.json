From the most centrally located station, Friedrichstrasse, it takes 47 min to Potsdam Hbf by S1 (40 min: S7+S1) and 28 min by RE1, the latter making limited stops in inner areas.\n\nFor the Schloss Sanssouci, Park Sanssouci and Krongut Bornstedt, you should take an RE1 train direction Brandenburg (",{"type":"'''","value":["not"]}," Magdeburg) and get off at Charlottenhof, the station following Potsdam Hbf.

The inner city of Potsdam is in Zone A, the outer parts are in Zone B, and the hinterland is Zone C.
