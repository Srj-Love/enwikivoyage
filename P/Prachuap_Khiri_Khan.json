It possesses various interesting tourism attractions such as beaches, islands, forests and mountains.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Understand "]},"\nThailand's royal family and especially former kings were the first to set this location on the map as the original seashore destination in Thailand. The long white sandy beaches themselves are clean, spotless and pretty, much more so than Pattaya's, and the sea is relatively clean. Besides just sunbathing snorkelling and swimming, visitors can also enjoy golf, spas, caves, peaks, waterfalls, shops, seafood and nearby national parks. The town is warm and laid-back making it ideal for families and couples.\n\nPrachuap Khiri Khan is in fact more of a holiday destination with local Thais than foreigners. Many Bangkokians purchase condominiums here. This guarantees a bit of a quiet atmosphere if you are fed up with noisy foreign tourists at their favourite locations, such as Pattaya or Ko Samui.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Geography "]},"\nPrachuap Khiri Khan Province covers an area of 6,368 square kilometres. It is a long and narrow coast stretching to the south. At the Singkhon Pass in the Mueang district, there is a border crossing into Burma. Near there, the distance from the Burmese border to the Gulf of Thailand is only 11 km. The length of the province from the north to the south is approximately 212 km.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" History "]},"\nOnce known as Muang Bang Nong Rom, Prachuap Khiri Khan was left to decay after the sacking of Ayutthaya at the end of the 18th century. The town was rebuilt at the mouth of the Ron River during the 19th century and renamed Prachuap Khiri Khan.\n\nIt was an old seaside resort during the reign of King Rama V. From historical evidence, Prachuap Khiri Khan was a location of Mueang Na Rang during the Ayutthaya period. In the reign of King Rama II of Rattanakosin, a new city was established at the mouth of the I Rom Canal and was named Mueang Bang Nang Rom. During the reign of King Rama IV, Mueang Bang Nang Rom, Mueang Kui, and Mueang Khlong Wan were combined into Mueang Prachuap Khiri Khan which means \"city of mountains\". The city hall was situated at Mueang Kui until 1898, when it was moved to Ao Ko Lak or Ao Prachuap, the location of Mueang Prachuap Khiri Khan today.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By car "]},"\nFrom Bangkok, there are 2 routes as follows:\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["First Route"]}," Take the Thonburi–Pak Tho Rd (Hwy 35), passing Samut Sakhon, Samut Songkhram, and turn left into Phetchakasem Rd (Hwy 4), passing Phetchaburi into Prachuap Khiri Khan.
