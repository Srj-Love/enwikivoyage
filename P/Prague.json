Prague lies on the banks of the beautiful, meandering Vltava River that reflects the city's golden spires and 9th century castle that dominates the skyline.\n\nThis historic atmosphere is combined with a certain quirkiness that embraces the entire city. From the Museum of Czech Cubism to the ",{"type":"''","value":["technicolor"]}," Jubilee Synagogue; the castle to the river, Prague is a ",{"type":"''","value":["bohemian"]}," capital in every sense.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Districts"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Prague districts en wv.jpg"],["thumbnail"]]},"\nConfusingly, ",{"type":"''","value":["several incompatible district systems"]}," are used in Prague. Partially, different systems are from different historic periods, but at least three different systems are used today for different purposes. To make things even worse, a single district name can be used in all the systems, but with different meanings.\n\nFor purposes of this guide, the \"old\" district system is used. In this \"old\" system, Prague is divided into ",{"type":"'''","value":["ten numbered districts"]},": ",{"type":"'''","value":["Praha 1"]}," through to ",{"type":"'''","value":["Praha 10"]},". If you encounter a higher district number, a different system is being used. For example, Praha 13 is part of the \"old\" Praha 5 district. The advantage of the \"old\" system of ten districts is that it is used on street signs and house numbers throughout the city, so you can always easily determine the \"old\" system district you are located in.\n\nPraha 1 is the oldest part of the city, the original 'Town of Prague', and has by far the densest number of attractions. Praha 2 also contains important historic areas. In this central area, the \"old\" district system (or any of the newer systems) is too crude to be practical, a finer division is needed. Traditional city \"quarters\" provide such a division. Their disadvantage is that they are somewhat incompatible with the modern district systems - although \"quarters\" are smaller than the \"old\" system districts, a single quarter can belong to two or even more districts. The advantage is that these central quarters are well known and widely used and identical with the homonymous cadastral areas shown on street and house number signs along the \"old\" district designation, allowing easy orientation.\n\nBuildings in big cities in Czech Republic have two numbers, one blue and one red. The blue ones are the orientation numbers - it is the ordinal number of the building on its street. Historically these numbers always started from the end of the street which is closer to a river. As is normal in Europe, odd numbers belong on one side of the street and even numbers on the other. This allows you to find quickly the house you are looking for. The red numbers are related to the house register of the entire quarter (for example, Staré Město), and thus usually correspond to the order the buildings in that district were constructed. Most people do not remember them; if somebody says e.g. the house is in Dlouha str. number 8, they will usually mean the blue number. Red numbers usually have 3 or more digits.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:View over Prague.JPG"],["thumb"],["400px"],["View over Prague (Castle on the left)"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Prague\/Old Town and Josefov"],["Old Town and Josefov"]]}]},"  Old Town (Staré město)— The nucleus of the right bank, the oldest part of Prague.

(But must have an id card with age and photo if older than 6.)\n\nAs you can see, the 24-hour or 3-day tickets are not economical unless you plan to travel more than 4 times a day for 90 minutes (6 hours).\n\nTickets can be bought at various places:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["ticket machines"]}," - sell 24, 32, 110 CZK tickets (take coins only but do return change)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["tobacco shops, convenience stores"]}," - usually 24 and 32 CZK tickets only"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Prague Public Transit offices"]}," - usually located at Metro stations (and the airport), sell all kinds of tickets"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["bus (but not tram) drivers"]}," - sell the 32 CZK tickets for a higher price of 40 CZK"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["all Czech Railways ticket offices"]}," - sell the 110 CZK tickets (validity is printed on the ticket, so ask them to set it to the date and time you need)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["EC\/IC trains"]}," - sometimes the conductors of these trains offer the 110 CZK tickets for sale before arrival to Prague"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["via SMS"]}," - service is available only for the Czech GSM operator customers"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Validate your ticket"]}," by slipping it into one of the yellow boxes in the tram, bus or ferry, as soon as you board. In the metro, on the S-trains and on the funicular, the validators are in stations instead of the vehicles. After having changed the tram\/bus, there is no need to validate it again. Be sure to keep it handy until it expires.\n\nTickets are not checked upon boarding, but uniformed or plain-clothed ticket inspectors often make the rounds asking to see your ticket. One problem is false inspectors who most often ride the trams between \"Malostranske Namesti\" and Prague Castle - these deceivers can be detected by asking for the identity card and badge which should be possessed by every inspector. An unstamped ticket is invalid - it will be confiscated, and you will incur a 700 CZK fine. Even though \"riding black\" seems easy in Prague, you should invest in the cheap ticket for the simple reason that Prague's transportation works perfectly and it functions on the honor system - help it stay that way.\n\nBe aware that some buses (number 300 to 499) and all S-trains go out of the city, so they work a little differently, because normal tickets are valid only within the city limits. You have to show your ticket to the bus driver or train conductor and possibly buy another ticket from them, if you plan to go out of the city. The most popular site reachable this way is the Karlštejn castle (train S7, leaving the main station every 30 minutes).\n\nPublic transport continues at night and it's fairly extensive ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ropid.cz\/download.php?idg=97&i=3&id=693&Lang=en"]},". Night trams or night buses (00:00 to 05:00; lines beginning with the number 5 and 6 for the bus going out of city) usually come every 30 minutes. Every 15 minutes during this time, trams leave the central exchange stop of Lazarská in the centre of Prague. All night trams go through this stop. You can easily change tram lines here if nowhere else. At all night exchange stops, trams and buses wait for the connecting tram\/bus.\n\nDo not underestimate how close to the footpath the trams will be when they reach the stop. It's safer to take a few steps back before the tram arrives, as wing mirrors could cause injury for taller people. In Metro, you should stay behind the dashed safety line on the floor about half a meter from the edge of the platform. On an escalator, it is customary to stand on the right side and walk up on the left side. When you use public transport in Prague, keep in mind that it is good etiquette to let elderly people, pregnant women or disabled people sit down.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Shuttle"]},"\nShared minibus airport service is cheaper alternative to regular door-to-door private transfers.

Mostly they charge more than they should. The municipal council has been trying to solve this problem since the Prague mayor dressed up as an Italian tourist and was repeatedly overcharged. The most frequent cases of cheating happen between the railway station or airport and hotel. If you must take a taxi, and cannot call one directly or call your hotel for a referral, the best way to find a reputable one may be to look for a hotel and ask them to call a taxi. (Most hotels in Prague have a \"deal\" with taxi services or they have their own \"hotel taxi\" which usually charges you 50% or more than the taxi companies listed above.)\n\nTaxi drivers at the railway station may show you a printed card that details the \"fixed fares\" for travel within the city.  This is completely false.  Don't fall for it.\n\nAlways insist on having the taxi-meter turned on and ask for a printed receipt once you leave the taxi. The receipt should have the driver's name, address and tax identification number included. Even though you ask for a receipt the taxi-meter could be tampered with using the so-called \"turbo\", which will cause the taxi-meter price to go sky high.\n\nIf you decide to flag down a taxi on the street make sure you stop a car with the logo of one of the major companies. It's not a bullet proof solution, but at least you have some chance to get some satisfaction from the taxi dispatching company.\n\nAbout two years ago, an information desk was set up on most taxi stands in the city, with orientation prices to most popular destinations from that stand. But there is a flaw in the local law, which actually allows some of the taxi companies renting the taxi stands (specifically around Old Town square) to charge VERY high prices (about 99CZK\/Km). There is an ongoing lawsuit regarding this, however the practice still hasn't stopped. The most infamous company in this regard is a recently created AAA Taxi s.r.o. deliberately creating its name to resemble regulated and popular AAA Radiotaxi Praha, however AAA Taxi cabs charge up to four times more for a ride, they even do not provide services to Czech customers ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.praguepost.com\/news\/1903-taxi-ruling-could-take-years.html"]},". Visitors are advised to use the services of proved phone-order taxis, as they are even reports of robberies with street cruising taxis ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.sedazona.cz\/2009\/09\/neznamy-svet-taxikarske-mafie\/"]},".\n\nIf you don't speak Czech, then be prepared: There is about a 50% chance you will be cheated by the driver, if you hail a taxi in the city center. So be always on watch as that is a standard warning in any guide book about Prague.\n\nIf you are convinced you got overcharged by the taxi driver, mark the car ID numbers (license plate, taxi license number on the car door, driver name, etc.) and contact the company which the driver is working for (if any) or police. The problem is that you have to testify against the driver, which is kind of hard when you're on the other side of the world. Try to avoid suspicious taxis and when in doubt, walk away and catch another taxi.\n\nAnother alternative is to use some of the chauffeured services companies like ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.prague-airport-transfers.co.uk Prague Airport Transfers s.r.o."]}," or ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.febatrade.cz\/ FEBA Trade Limousine Car Service"]}," or even cheaper but as reliable HFS s.r.o. - ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.123-Prague-Airport-Transfer.com\/ 123-Prague-Airport-Transfer.com"]},", or ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.transfer-prague.com\/ Transfer-Prague.com"]},".\n\nSome hotels offer taxi services. Make sure to compare the price with other companies.  Some hotel taxis are cheap but others are more than twice the price and the car is not always identified as being a taxi. (Most of hotels in Prague have \"deal\" with taxi services or they have own \"hotel taxi\" and usually charge you by 50% or more than companies written above)\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\nYou can travel down the famous Vltava River (Moldau, in German), which inspired writers and composers such as Smetana and Dvorak.\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.praguesteamboats.com\/ Prague Steamboat Company"]}]}," offers sight seeing cruises as well as trips to the Prague ZOO or the Slapy River Dam.\n\nThere also few small passenger ferries across the river ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ropid.cz\/cestujeme\/privozy-v-pid-%28od-1.1.2012%29__s191x694.html"]},", integrated to the Prague's public transport tariff.\n\nOr you can enjoy travel by boat in historic centre of Prague.

Czech cuisine is typically based around pork or beef with starchy side dishes such as dumplings, potatoes, or fries. Fish is not as popular, though these days it is widely available. Popular Czech desserts include fruit dumplings (ovocné knedlíky), crêpes or ice cream. Most restaurants become very crowded during lunch and dinner, so consider making a reservation or eating earlier than the locals.\n\nThe tip should be about 10 to 15% - in cheaper restaurants or pubs you can get away with rounding up the note or leaving a few extra coins. Otherwise it's customary to leave at least 20-40CZK or €1-2. Taxes are always included in the price by law. Many restaurants in heavily-touristed areas (along the river, or with views near the castle) will charge a cover or \"kovert\" in addition to your meal charge.  If this is printed in the menu, you have no recourse. But a restaurant will often add this charge to your bill in a less up-front manner, sometimes after printing in the menu that there is no cover. Anything brought to your table will have a charge associated with it (bread, ketchup, etc.) If you are presented with a hand-scrawled bill at the end of the meal, it is suggested that you take a moment to clarify the charges with your server. This sort of questioning will usually shame the server into removing anything that was incorrectly added. It should be noted that some waiters are impolite especially to people from the eastern part of Europe.

Definitely try the hot dogs (párek v rohlíku) - they're far superior to the greasy, messy version you get in the West. Small, hollowed-out French baguettes are used for the bread, filled with mustard and ketchup, and then the frankfurter is inserted afterwards. This turns the bread into a convenient carry-case and means you don't get ketchup all over your hands. Make sure you get mustard, even if you don't normally like it - unfortunately the hot dogs are somewhat flavorless and need that extra bit of kick. Prices range from around 15 crowns for a small one to 45 crowns for the terrifying-looking 'gigant'. Note that size of hot dog relates to girth rather than length.

But it even if you do not drive any cars, pickpocketing is common in Prague, and some violent crimes do occur in this city. You are seriously warned not to provoke drunken people as it will pose yourself in extreme danger. Overall Prague is a relatively safe city and with normal common sense one should be able to avoid problems; even at night a woman can walk alone. There are no \"no go\" areas. The only area with a high concentration of homeless is in front of the central station.\n\nBegging occurs at the city's top tourist attractions and in some of the main public transport hubs. Don't carry a wallet or purse in the back pocket of your pants; always keep an eye on your items; don't put all your money in one place; don't show your money or valuable things to anybody. Better safe than sorry so take enough precautions for yourself.\n\nPossession of drugs has been historically a grey area under the Czech jurisdiction.

They usually work in teams of 3-5 and look for lost or distracted tourists. Backpacks are especially interesting to them. Many of those groups use underage children as pickpockets because they are not liable according to Czech criminal law.\n\nDue to the low incidence of violent crime, the threat of pickpockets has been played up as a great problem. However, common sense and basic precautions can keep most people safe from pickpockets. If you have a camera, try not to wear it openly. Always close and secure your backpack and try to keep an eye on it. Be especially careful not to fall asleep in tram or metro. Wear your wallet in a safe place (like inner pocket of your coat), never put it into your rear pocket or any other place where it can be easily stolen.\n\nBe astute on sleeper trains, as bag robberies are on the increase between major stations. Ask for ID from anyone who asks to take your ticket or passport, and lock backpacks to the luggage racks. Keep valuables on you and maintain common sense.\n\nIf you enter the metro (usually at night), you may find a team of con artists at the stations, saying that they are metro clerks and, after examining your ticket for some time, that it's invalid so you'll have to pay a fine of 500 CZK (1000 CZK if you argue with them). So if you happen to see them and you're sure that your ticket is valid, tell them to call the police, or call them yourself. Remember that Prague Metro ticket inspectors have to produce their badge in order to check your ticket and issue a fine; if they don't do this as soon as they approach you then, they are almost certainly fakes.\n\nBe careful with taxi drivers, particularly from the train station. Taxis that are legally registered may still be mafia-run affairs that do their best to overcharge. It is illegal for a taxi driver to refuse you a receipt in Prague, so agree to a price before putting yourself or your luggage in the taxi. The risk of overcharging is greatly overplayed but just take the usual sensible precautions of only using taxi firms affiliated with the station or your hotel, or call a reputable company and wait. Finally, if presented with an incorrect bill from a taxi driver, call the police on your mobile phone: the driver will quickly change his tune. You can of course always ask reception, restaurant etc. to call taxi on the number you give them.\n\nIf you can't afford to haggle with cab drivers, you can always use public mass transit. The network is extensive and can take you almost anywhere in Prague 24 hours every day.\n\nBe careful with money exchanges. Exchange your money in banks or official tourist informations and rather avoid exchange offices. Never deal with a street money-dealer: they offer better rates but frequently try to swindle you by giving you money from another country, such as Russian rubles or old Bulgarian leva.\n\nMost of the exchange offices are fair, but some, especially at the busiest tourist sites, may try to cheat customers with various tricks. One of the them is offering favourable exchange rates, but with fine print below such as if you exchange more than €1000. Another trick is putting a huge board with \"we sell\" exchange rates to the shop window, which makes an impression of good rates, whereas the actual rate for ",{"type":"'''","value":["buying"]}," CZK is much more unfavourable.\n\nWhen the customer finds this out at the counter and wants to cancel the transaction, the money-dealer refuses with an excuse \"I have already printed the bill\", implying it is too late. The police won't help you, typically referring you to the Czech National Bank, which supervises exchange offices, to file a complaint (which does not help you either).\n\nCredit cards are widely accepted at all supermarkets, hotels and also in most tourist places. As in most countries you can find cards for ATM withdrawals with low or 0% fee and often for payment with Visa or MasterCard exchange rate only (which is same as rate of best exchange offices), there is no need to use exchange offices anymore in 21st century.\n\nCzech law is weak and orders exchange offices only to display the actual rates, which you might find somewhere in the office in small print. Therefore, if you decide to use an exchange office always ask for the actual rate you will pay before making the transaction before releasing any money out of your hand.\n\nIf you find yourself in emergency, dial 158 for police, 155 for ambulance or 150 for firefighters. You can also dial 112 for a general emergency call.\n\nIf you need medication at weekends or evenings, you can go to ",{"type":"'''","value":["Lékárna Palackého"]},", (Tel +420 224 946 982) the 24-hour pharmacy on Palackého 5 in the new town.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Local foreign language media"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''''","value":["The Prague Post"]}," (weekly newspaper, in English) ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.praguepost.com"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Prague Daily Monitor"]}," (website in English) ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.praguemonitor.com"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''''","value":["Radio Prague"]}," (multilingual radio station, website) ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.radio.cz\/en"]}]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Embassies"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["Finland"]]},"  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Finland"],["url=http:\/\/www.finland.cz"],["email=sanomat.pra@formin.fi"],["address=Hellichova 1, 11800 Prague 1"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+420 2511 77251"],["tollfree="],["fax=+420 2511 77241"],["hours=Mo-Fr 9AM-noon"],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["Austria"]]},"  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Austria"],["url=http:\/\/www.bmeia.gv.at\/botschaft\/prag.html"],["email=prag-ob@bmeia.gv.at"],["address=Viktora Huga 10, CZ-15115 Prag 5"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+420 257 09 05-11"],["tollfree="],["fax=+420 257 31 60 45"],["hours=Mo-Fr: 9:00 - 12:00"],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nBuses and trains are frequent and quite inexpensive and can get you to even the smallest village.\n\nPractically every major European city can be reached by bus or train from Prague.\n\nRegular buses are available to the following Czech towns, travel times in brackets:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brno"]]}," (210 km;
