Prespa is a transboundary park shared between Greece, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Albania"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Republic of Macedonia"],["fYR of Macedonia"]]},". \nThe main features of the region are the two lakes, that also gives the name to the area: Macro Prespa (259.4 km2 and Micro Prespa (47.4 km2), which lap the shores of the three countries and connect them in this way symbolically. \n\nPrespa is well known for its natural beauty and its high biodiversity with unique characteristics. It hosts more than 1,500 species of plants, 40 species of mammals, 260 of birds, 32 reptiles and amphibians, and 17 species of fish including a number of species found only here.\nThe mountains are one of the last European homes of brown bears, wolves, chamois and wild boar whilst the lake host breeding colonies of Dalmatian and White Pelicans as well as pygmy cormorants.\n\nIn addition, is a place where a unique natural environment coexists with notable Byzantine monuments like churches, monasteries, hermitages and rock paintings dating from the 10th century onwards.\n\nThe life of the local people is concentrated in villages around the lakes. The houses are built in a traditional style, out of stone and clay bricks with roofs of straw or stone tiles\n\nThe three main traditional occupations in the region are fishing, animal husbandry and a small agricultural community which over the centuries has shaped and preserved a wealth of natural and cultural values that account for the area’s international importance.\n\nPrespa is a place where nature, art and history come together in and around the lakes; there are also villages with hospitable inhabitants, always worth a stop on the way to listen to their stories and the histories of the place. \n\nThere are a lot of paths, guiding you into the heart of nature; perhaps up into the high mountains, or to old abandoned villages, which little by little are being returned once more to nature’s embrace. \nThe mountains surrounding the lakes are often over 2000 meters high, and offer marvellous views to the lake blueness and the settlements on the shores. The smell of herbs on the mountain meadows calm the senses, already cleared by the fresh air and the spring waters\n\nThe lucky visitor might arrive to a peaceful natural setting with impressive sunsets, that gives the impression of having remained unchanged since time immemorial, unique within Greece in traditions, methods of fishing and producing and preserving food, and a rich cultural heritage.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nPrespa has always been a place where people and culture have met. It’s story has seen the rule of Bulgars, Serbs, Franks, Byzantians and Ottomans, giving the area a rich and interesting cultural heritage. \nPrespa has many Byzantine and post-Byzantine monuments. The most famous is certainly the Basilica of Agios Achillios, on the island of same name, built by Samuel, Czar of the Bulgars in the late 10th century. However many other churches are interesting to visit too: the 11th century church of Agios Germanos with its beautiful frescoes, the recently restored 15th century church of Agios Nikolaos on the edge of Pili village, or the church of the Virgin of the Porphyra on the island of Agios Achillios. \nAfter the collapse of the Byzantine Empire in the mid 14th century, came five centuries of Ottoman rule. However, Prespa being so remote, the Turkish presence was relatively light. This period then saw a flourishing Christian presence, with the building of churches, monasteries and hermitages. On the shore of lake Megali Prespa one can find the remains of numerous hermitages, still decorated with impressive frescoes dating up to the 14th century. These are easily accessible by boat, but a bit more difficult is the walk to them. However a lucky trekker will be granted an amazing view over the lake.\n\nThe XXth Century was incredibly eventful. The Macedonian Struggle and the Balkan wars saw fights for regional identities and the division into tree countries. The First World War brought the occupation by the French army, and the subsequent debacle of the Greek army and forced population exchanges emptied the region of all the Muslims, who had to move to Turkey in exchange for Asia Minor Greeks.\nHowever, the most painful part of the century was the Greek civil war, Prespa being under Communist partisan control. There are still remains of their headquarters and a field hospital to be found in cave. At the end of the war, most of the inhabitants were forced to flee the area. Later few ever returned, and some villages disappeared.\nIn the 50s, the Greek government settled Vlach communities and immigrants from Asia Minor in Prespa. However, like most of the Greek countryside, Prespa suffered strong rural desertification in the 70s, people leaving for the city or abroad. Unfortunately, the population of Prespa has never returned to its pre-war level.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\nDue to the extraordinary beauty of the lakes and the surrounding mountains, the high biodiversity and the rich plant and animal life, in this region three national parks have been declared, one in each of the neighbouring countries. In Greece and Albania have the same name called the National Park Prespa and in FYR Macedonia the National Park Galichitsa.. In the year 2000 it was declaresd the trasboundery park Prespa which includes the whole watershed area of bolth Prespa Lakes and has a surface of approx. 2000km2.\n\nPrespa is protected under the Ramsar convention as a wetland of international importance and a European Importand Bird Area as well as being include in Natura 2000, a network of the EU most precious natural areas.\nPrepa contains the largest breeding colony of Dalmatian pelicans in the world, a mixed colony of pelicans and the largest colony of Pygmy cormorants in Europe.\nIt provides shelter to over 200 species of birds, many of which belong to rare or declining populations within Europe. That´s why Prespa is something of a paradise for bird lovers as it contain so many species reflecting such different habitats in close proximity.\n\n\tIt is worth mentioning the presence of rare mammal species, endangered throughout Europe, such as the Brown Bear, the Grey Wolf, the European Otter and the Chamois.\n\nThe botanists will delight in the many species of Orchids to be found here as well as the endemic species Centurea Prespana. Indeed amateur lovers of all plants can find something for themselves in Prespa strolling through the plains by the like, exploring the beach, oak and juniper forests of striding across the open alpine spaces of the mountain tops\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nPrespa is a small microclimate found in a mountainous region. The lakes are approximately 850m above the sea level and the higher mountain around the lake are above 2100m. Generally speaking the climate and biology of the area reflect that of the Balkans rather than Mediterranean that many people expects of Greece. Prespa can be very hot in summer reaching 35 degrees in August, however it have cool nights. In winter there will be snow and temperatures can fall lover than -15 degrees although generally will be around -5 degrees.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nBy air: ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Thessaloniki"]]}," airport is the nearest international airport and is approximately 3 hours drive east of Prespa.\n\nThe closest city to Prespa is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Florina"]]},".\n\nBy train:There is a train service from Thessaloniki, which will take you as far as Florina, one hours drive from Prespa. For schedules and prices contact the train company OSE.\n\nBy bus: KTEL runs services twice from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Athens"]]}," to Florina (8hours). There are also five buses daily from Thessaloniki (3hours). There is no public transport from Kastoria to Prespa. \nThe local bus service from Florina runs Monday, Wednesday and Friday: \nFrom Florina to Prespa at 7.00am  and 15.00 am (Mo,We,Fri).\nFrom Prespa to Florina at 8.30am and 4.30pm (Mo, We, Fr).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nThe ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.prespes.gr municipality of Prespa"]}," includes 15 villages, each village has between 1 and 200 inhabitants. The distance between the villages is quite large: there is not local public transport between them, only to Florina, the closest city, a distance of 50 km. \nMost of the villages have a local shop with a small selection of goods and also a traditional coffee bar (mostly visited just by men). There are a number of hotels, tavernas and bars in the municipality although these are spread over quite a large area. Other facilities include a couple of supermarkets and petrol stations accessible by car.\n\nHistorically the villages split into those of Upper Prespa (Psarades, Vrondero, Pili and Agios Achilios and Lower Prespa (Agios Germanos, Laimos, Plati, Kallithea, Lefkona, Karies, Oxia and MIkrolimni)\nAt the furthest end of Prespa is Vrondero, the only village in Prespa without a view of the lake.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Ruins of abandoned villages"]}," \n\nThe ruins of abandoned villages are a good opportunity for visitors to walk and discover the lesser-known and more peaceful places in Prespa, hidden in the mountains.\n\nThe easiest to reach is Daseri, near Pili. The only remains are the wall of the school and the stone bases of the houses. \nIn Agathoto you can find the remains of a small church, hidden behind rocks and trees. \n\nAlmost nothing remains of the Latsista settlement, situated amongst the small hills behind Mikrolimni. It is an ideal place for bird watching, due to the wetlands found there.\n\nKrania, where only a few houses remain, is situated a few kilometres further on. On the way there you can enjoy a unique view of the lake.\n\nSfika, in the mountains above Oxia was once quite a large village as can be seen from the size of the church, where only one fresco remains. The church is hidden in the forest and it is a delightful surprise to discover it so far from any inhabited area.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Churches"]},"\n\nMost of the churches, basilicas and monasteries found in Prespa correspond to Byzantine and post-Byzantine styles. \nEven though some churches are not open to the public, you can still admire their external architecture.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["- Church of Agios Germanos (11th c.)"]}," \n\n-",{"type":"'''","value":[" Church of Agios Athanasios (end of the 18th c.)"]},"\nBoth located in the village of Agios Germanos.

The two main products in the area are peppers and beans. The peppers of the shore of Prespa, are rich flesh and taste and the residents of the area really understand a little secret about peppers: red, green, yellow, blazing and aromatic; they need to be roasted or fried to truly reveal their sumptuous flavour. \nAll over the Greek Prespa area people grow beans on fields and in the back garden. Smalls beans “plake” and big beans “gigantes” are the two kinds. The bean soup “fasolada” as well as the baked gigant beans “gigantes sto founo” are skillfully prepared here.\n\nVery often the table is enriched with various types of fish from the lakes, cooked in different styles, depending on the type and season.  \nThe taste of the Prespa carp and the small, tasty fish called \"tsironi\" is a unique experience, especially because these fish are endemic forms and can only be found here. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nThe traditional cuisine would not be completed without the presence of the traditional drop. There is hardly a household in the region without a barrel full of wine and “tsipouro”, destilled according to old recipes. Very often anis, mastika, peppermint or other herbs are added to the spirit, contributing not only to the aroma of the drink, but also to its healing powers, of course if drunk in reasonable amounts.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Lodging"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Hotels & Guest Houses"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Agios Achillios"],["alt=Άγιος Αχίλλειος"],["url="],["email="],["address=Agios Achillios"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+30 2385 046601"],["tollfree="],["fax=+30 2385 046931"],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Agios Germanos"],["alt=Άγιος Γερμανός"],["url=http:\/\/www.prespa.com.gr"],["email=info@prespa.com.gr"],["address=Agios Germanos"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+30 2385 051397"],["tollfree="],["fax=+30 2381 088105"],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Ariadni"],["alt=Αριάδνη"],["url=http:\/\/www.ariadni-prespes.gr"],["email=info@ariadni-prespes.gr"],["address=Laimos"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+30 2385 051850"],["tollfree="],["fax=+30 2385 051853"],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Liakoto"],["alt=Το Λιακωτό"],["url="],["email=liakoto1@otenet.gr"],["address=Laimos"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+30 2385 051200"],["tollfree="],["fax=+30 2385 051200"],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Hotel Mimallones"],["url="],["email=info@mimallones.gr"],["address=Laimos"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+30 2385 051422"],["tollfree="],["fax=+30 2385 051460"],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Paradosi"],["alt=Παράδοση"],["url=http:\/\/www.prespes-agiosgermanos.gr"],["email="],["address=Agios Germanos"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+30 2385 051356"],["tollfree="],["fax=+30 2385 051356"],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Petrino"],["alt=Το Πέτρινο"],["url=http:\/\/www.prespespetrino.com\/en\/"],["email=info@prespespetrino.com"],["address=Agios Germanos"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+30 6946 338162"],["tollfree="],["fax=+30 2385 051854"],["hours="],["price=From €50"],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=A guesthouse in a restored stone house in the village.
