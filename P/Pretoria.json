During the 15th century the Ndebele people also migrated into the area and settled along the banks of what is today called the Apies River. Around 1820 the Matabele under the leadership of Mzilikaza also entered the region, leading to local conflicts between the Matabele newcomers and the already established Sotho and Ndebele tribes as well as the European ",{"type":"''","value":["Voortrekkers"]}," who were steadily moving northward through the country. These conflicts came to an end when the Matabele were defeated by the ",{"type":"''","value":["Voortrekkers"]}," in 1837 at Mosega.\n\nBy 1855 there was no known tribe in what is known as Pretoria area today. Only nomadic groups passed through this area, with a leader\/person Tshwane (so it is alleged) one of the them. Pretoria was founded in 1855. Initially the capital of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek was Ohrigstad, but Pretoria became the capital of the then ZAR. Later on Pretoria became the capital of the Transvaal province (old ZAR) after the Anglo-Boer War. The city was named after Andries Pretorius, the ",{"type":"''","value":["boer"]}," leader at the Battle of Blood River where the ",{"type":"''","value":["Voortrekkers"]}," defeated the Zulus under King Dingaan. In 1856 the area today known as Arcadia was acquired in exchange for a pony and added to the town.\n\nIn 1899, during the Anglo-Boer War, Winston Churchill was captured and held as a POW in Pretoria until his eventual escape to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mozambique"]]},".

The thunderstorms are often accompanied by lightning and occasionally result in hail.

Winters are mild and dry with temperatures averaging between a minimum of 5°C and a maximum of 20°C. Winter nights and (occasionally winter days) can be surprisingly cold and buildings are generally not well insulated.
