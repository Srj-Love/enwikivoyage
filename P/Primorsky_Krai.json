There were several Chinese and Korean  villages and hunters' \"fanza\"s when Russians explorers and Cossacks established their posts. Primorsky Krai (a.k.a. Primorye) is Russia's main outlet to the Pacific Ocean. 95 settlements were founded by the Russians in the latter half of the 19th century. During the February Revolution the Krai became a part of Far-Eastern Republic. The Civil War brought American, Japanese, and Czechoslovak intervention and caused emigration to China and other countries. It was the landing site of the USS Hornet in 1942 before it raided on Japan. Josef Stalin deported 174,000 Koreans from the border areas across the Far East to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Uzbekistan"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kazakhstan"]]}," between 1937 and 1939.
