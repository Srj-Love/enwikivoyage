Those who hike even short distances off highways may see foxes, black bears, moose (often standing in water, eating), and more rarely wolves and bison (buffalo).  The lakes have many fish, and can be caught with a rod and reel - a National Parks fishing license is required.  The types of fish often caught are northern pike (locally called \"jackfish\"), walleye (locally called \"pickeral), white perch, whitefish.

The terrain is mostly through bush country and to see lakes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nIt is quite safe from people.  Leaving automobiles locked will be safe everywhere.  Putting things out of sight of others will help ensure this.  It is normal to ask others to watch your things even if you just met them, e.g. in a campground or on the beach.    \n\nThe most risky thing is to leave any food or scraps, even garbage out. The bears will smell it and then tear up your campsite to find more. It is illegal to feed any animals at all, even if they are cute, for this reason.  Also, never get too close to a deer or elk, which may run at you.  Bear and other animal attacks are rare, and will not happen if you follow the instructions you will be given.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Prince Albert National Park"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["53.963333"],["-106.370000"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Northern Saskatchewan"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinepark"]]}]
