It is possible to hire a taxi to drive you between points but this can be costly. While driving be alert and courteous of slow moving tractors on County roads, as they often use main roads to travel between farms. Usually the driver will wait until it is safe and move to the side, allowing you to pass. Signs posted in rural areas remind drivers \"Slow Moving Vehicles- Farmers producing YOUR food.\" Please respect these hard working people and realize that honking and\/or tailgating will not get you very far. Also, be mindful of the many cyclists that travel County roads as there are no bicycle lanes on most roads.\n\nCycling is an environmentally friendly and increasingly popular way to see the area. To avoid busier main roads The County has many side roads that are well worn and paved in many cases.
