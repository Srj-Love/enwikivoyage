The Park is also home to the Maryland Archeology Conservation Lab, a state-of-the-art research, conservation, and collections storage facility.

Crab cakes come in two sizes, small and regular. The small is the size of a baseball and ordered as a sandwich is an ample meal for one. Order the regular and they'll have to carry you out. Stoney's also has great tomato-based seafood chowder, fried rockfish (another Maryland classic), mussels, and potato salad.
