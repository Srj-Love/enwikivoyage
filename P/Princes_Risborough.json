[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Princes Risborough"]}," is a small town in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Buckinghamshire"]]},".  It's on the A4010 about halfway between High Wycombe and Aylesbury.  The population is around 10,000.  Why \"Princes\"? Because Edward the Black Prince apparently had a palace near St Mary's Church. (The site is now, in the finest British tradition, a car park.)  Before then, it was \"Great Risborough\" on the same pattern as Great Missenden, and there was a Little Risborough, which changed its name to Monks Risborough as it had a monastery (no longer extant).\n\nGetting information about Princes Risborough (\"Risborough\" for short) is very easy.  No emigrants to other parts of the world seem to have called anywhere else by the same name, so a Google search for \"Princes Risborough\" (with the quotes) will get useful results.
