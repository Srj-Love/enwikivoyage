As well, the small island of Vivara, linked to Procida by a bridge, has archaeological excavations.\n\nThe architecture of Procida has a Greek origin. In fact, the history of Procida is concentrated first of all on the medieval village “Terra Murata” and on “Corricella”, the fishing settlement.\n\nThe island has served as the set for numerous films, such as The “Postman” by Massimo Troisi, and some scenes in “The Talented Mr. Ripley” were shot on Corricella.\n\nThe landmarks of Procida reflect typical Mediterranean pastel colours. \n\nProcida offers simply cooking and at least 10 excellent restaurants with plain cooking based on fresh fish. This simple style never fails, thanks to the 20 fishing boats and a lot of small drifters.\n\nThe specialties of the cooking are: stewed rabbit (which goes back to the Borbonen who came on Procida to hunt the wild rabbit on Vivara) and spaghetti with sea-urchin. Procida has 6 beaches and 3 tufaceous sides with crystal-clear waters.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nFerry service is available at reasonable prices from Naples, Capri, and Ischia. you can get ferry information via http:\/\/www.procida.it\/orari.htm.
