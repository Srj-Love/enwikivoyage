The two main airlines flying to here are ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.virginblue.com.au Virgin Blue"]}," and ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.jetstar.com.au Jetstar"]},". After arriving at the airport, luggage is driven around the side of the building be collected from a trailer. A number of buses serve the terminal, and drive to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Airlie Beach"]]}," or other locations but all but one must be prebooked. The tickets cost a flat $15 per person one way and can be purchased in a queue at a clearly marked booth just inside the arrival gate. The bus driver mans the booth, and when everyone has got a ticket (about 30-40 minutes wait from arrival) the bus gets going. Another option is to take a taxi, for which there is also a booth inside the arrivals gate. However taxi rides seem to match the bus price, and cost $15 per person. Also, there may not be any taxis waiting. The ride to Airlie beach is smooth and takes about 40 minutes. The driver will ask where you are staying and take you to the door of the hostel or hotel in Airlie Beach.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The 62m ",{"type":"'''","value":["Proserpine Mill chimneys"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Proserpine water tower and associated mural"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Art Deco facades"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Peter Faust Dam"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Proserpine Historical Museum"]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Routebox"],["directionl1=N"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bowen"]]}],["directionr1=S"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mackay"]]}],["image1=Australian Route 1.svg"],["imagesize1=22"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Proserpine, Queensland"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["-20.401640"],["148.581500"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Far North Queensland"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Oceania\/Australia\/Queensland\/Localities\/P\/Proserpine\/"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Proserpine, Queensland"]]}]
