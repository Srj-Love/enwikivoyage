The low-lying parts of this region are generally dry and warm for most of the year, but the higher parts stretching up into the Alps, though still dry, can be quite cool. This southern-most part of the Alps is the sunniest in the range.\n\nProvence is now a part of the official administrative region of Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, but the region's identity is associated more closely with its history and culture. Although a bit stereotyped now (those lavender fields all over postcards and guidebooks that you'll have a hard time finding!), contemporary Provençal life is rooted in a long heritage of lively regional culture and language.\n\nProvence is a vast and beautiful region, and merits a long trip, not just a few days or a week. To truly appreciate this region, you must be the type of traveller who likes food, wine and local crafts. It is recommended that you plan your own itinerary, and make it flexible enough so you can linger at an outdoor café or appreciate a Roman ruin when the moment takes you. There is a ",{"type":"''","value":["joie de vivre"]}," attitude throughout the region that is contagious, especially after a picnic of cheese and sausage bought direct from local farmers and two glasses of a good rosé.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Read"]},"\n\nMost French cities have their own visitor websites and tourist offices which offer a wealth of information in many languages, allowing anyone interested the means to find what they are looking for.\n\nThose interested in literary interpretations of Provençal life should look up the works of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Marcel Pagnol"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Peter Mayle"]},", the latter only if wealthy British expats are your cup of tea. Specifically, Mayle's \"French Lessons: Adventures with Knife, Fork, and Corkscrew\" also gives a bunch of practical tips and recommendations for every district of Provence, as well as which areas to visit for their gastronomy.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["French"]}," is of course the official language of this region, but you'll find that many locals have a ",{"type":"'''","value":["regional accent"]},". The ",{"type":"''","value":["e"]}," at the end of words is often pronounced softly in Provence, where in standard French they are not pronounced at all.\n\nAn example: the word \"Provence\" in standard French ends with an \"s\" sound, as \"proh-VAHNSS\", where in Provence itself, it will often be ended with a sound resembling a short English \"eh\", as \"proh-VEN-seh\".  Many vowels are changed as well, being pronounced in a manner somewhat closer to the English pronunciation of the written vowels. However, standard French will be understood by the locals.\n\nThis accent is largely due to the fact that several generations ago a different language - ",{"type":"'''","value":["Occitan"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["la langue d'Oc"]}," - was spoken and so most locals only learned French at school. The dialect of Occitan spoken in Avignon was Provençal, and was the subject of strong preservation attempts in the early 1900s on the part of a group of writers and artists known as the ",{"type":"''","value":["Félibrige"]},". The most famous of these was Frédéric Mistral, winner of the Nobel Prize of Literature in 1908. Despite the efforts of the ",{"type":"''","value":["Félibrige"]},", the language has now largely disappeared, though it is still taught in some regional universities and courses run by non-profit groups. In certain areas, road signs are bilingual, with place-names and some local information being printed in both standard French and Occitan. \n\nTravellers interested in learning some French or Occitan can check out the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["French phrasebook"],["French"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Provençal phrasebook"],["Provençal"]]}," phrasebooks.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nThe two major airports for the region are ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.marseille-airport.com\/ Marseille-Provence"]}," and ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/en.nice.aeroport.fr\/ Nice-Côte d'Azur"]},".

The ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/tgv.uk.voyages-sncf.com\/en\/ TGV"]}," (high speed train) gets you down to the Mediterranean sun in about three hours from Paris.

On Saturdays in the summer season, a ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.eurostar.com Eurostar"]}," service operates to Avignon direct from London. At all other times of the year, travellers coming from the British capital may catch the Eurostar to Lille or Paris and make the connection onto the TGV network.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nFrance has an extensive and comprehensive motorway network; it's well-maintained and often free of congestion. If you're travelling from elsewhere in the country, or from nearby Italy or Spain, driving may be the way to go. However, because of the price of petrol and most of the motorways being toll roads, visitors coming from the UK and northern Europe may think twice before getting behind the wheel. At any rate, with typical (non-stop) driving times from the Eurotunnel terminal and the English Channel ports being around 10 hours, the journey is long but do-able. \n\n",{"type":"''","value":["For loads more information about driving in France, read this handy ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Driving in France"],["Wikivoyage guide"]]},"."]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nThe best way to explore is by car or bicycle.

Expect to see everything from wonderfully local breads to meats and cheeses, fresh seafood as well as herbs, citrus fruits, olives and figs, not to mention artisan crafts and the ubiquitous lavender. As in much of France, locals are fiercely proud of their region's produce, and with such a diverse repertoire, you can hardly blame themǃ\n\nWhat's the most Provençal sport you can think of? Go to any town square or public park in the region and chances are you'll see groups of older men playing ",{"type":"'''","value":["Pétanque"]},". The aim of this southern French variation of Boules is to roll one's own metal balls as close to the ",{"type":"''","value":["cochonnet"]}," (a little wooden ball known in English as a \"Jack\") as possible, knocking out other players' ball in the process; the player whose ball is closest to the ",{"type":"''","value":["cochonnet"]}," at the end wins the game. Visitors wishing to try it out can usually find a cheap set on sale in supermarkets and larger towns even have their own pétanque courts. More adventurous travellers may even volunteer to join a locals' game. If you are friendly and polite, the other players will most likely jump at the chance to share their sport with a foreigner and this can be a great way to try out your French on the locals. But be warnedː despite the game's relaxed reputation, competition can get quite fierce among more seasoned playersǃ\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nCenturies of intense study of the culinary arts has produced a country where the food is almost invariably excellent. It is difficult to have a bad meal because French standards are so high. Nonetheless, in tourist traps there are places where standards slip, but to avoid this the classic tip is to choose restaurants that are busy with locals.\n\nEach village in the region has a market day. You can buy local fare such as breads, cheeses, sausage, olives and preserves straight from the farmers and take them (the food that is, not the farmersǃ) for a picnic while exploring the countryside.\n\nIf you are going out for a sit-down meal, there are three main types of dining experiences to choose from. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Restaurants"]}," are more formal in France, serving full dinner menus and at a pace that is slower than in, say, North America. You are expected to enjoy the food and it should be the main reason for going out. It is considered inappropriate to request that a dish be prepared in a different way than is stated on the menu. Restaurants usually have a selection of set menus, each with a different price range. You can also choose from a list of à la carte items. A ",{"type":"'''","value":["bistrot"]}," is more casual and has more individual items, while a ",{"type":"'''","value":["café"]}," is more casual still, serving press coffee, drinks, sandwiches (such as the ubiquitous ",{"type":"''","value":["croque monsieur"]},") or pizzas.\n\nProvence has a unique cuisine that reflects its Mediterranean history and frequent exchange of cultures. This is an olive-growing region, and there are many varieties, ranging from the tiny peanut size Niçois olives to the large Bouteillan or Aups olives. Other than oil, olives are also enjoyed as spreads either alone (",{"type":"''","value":["Olivade"]},") or mixed with capers (",{"type":"''","value":["Tapenade"]},"). Many producers offer guided visits of their groves; these can be smallholding-sized plots but some are set in the grounds of real châteaux. \n\nWhile many products are found all over the region, some are best sampled in certain areas. Let it be known that despite the region's bounty of native fare, the Provence has a highly popular pizzeria culture. OK, now that that announcement is out of the way, let's move on to some real Provençal cuisineǃ \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["On the coast"]},", most of the cooking is fish-based, with sardines and anchovies being the most popular. For English speakers, the region's two best-known ",{"type":"''","value":["plats"]}," are of course ",{"type":"''","value":["bouillabaisse"]},", a fish stew rich in herbs and spices, and the famous ",{"type":"''","value":["salade niçoise"]},", a tunafish salad made with eggs, anchovies, tomatoes, green beans and black olives. While sampling both of these is a must, other lesser-known but equally tasty dishes include ",{"type":"''","value":["anchoiade"]},", which is an anchovy-based apéritif spread, garlicky ",{"type":"''","value":["aioli"]}," and a Marseille specialityː grilled sardines.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["In the hills"]},", easily the most famous and best-loved dish is ",{"type":"''","value":["ratatouille"]},", which in real life is even better than a certain Pixar film shows it to be. Though it be but a simple vegetable stew, and a peasant dish to boot, ",{"type":"''","value":["ratatouille"]}," is a very special mix of fresh courgette (USː zucchini fruit), mushrooms, aubergine (USː eggplant), bell peppers, tomatoes and onion as well as garlic and Provençal herbs. In season, one can also enjoy stuffed vegetables (",{"type":"''","value":["farcis"]},") that are typical of rustic cooking. If the thought of all those vegetables is making you queasy, here's one for the carnivores. ",{"type":"''","value":["Daube"]}," is a scrumptious beef stew that is often mixed with olives.  \n\nFor ",{"type":"'''","value":["dessert"]},", the ",{"type":"''","value":["tropézienne"]}," cake is not to be missed. This fluffy sponge-cake will cool you down nicely in the summer inferno. At the other end of the year, you may experience a unique Christmas ritual that will have pudding lovers salivatingː at the end of the Christmas meal, no fewer than thirteen desserts are servedǃ Which particular thirteen is a hotly-debated question (debate being one of the Provençal people's favourite activities). Despite the disagreement, an official list has been drawn up which encompasses: ",{"type":"''","value":["pompe à huile"]},", the so-called \"four beggars\" (nuts, dried figs, almonds and raisins), dates, apples, pears, water melon, grapes, both black and white nougat and sorbet.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nAll ",{"type":"'''","value":["wine"]}," in this region is of high quality and must be tastedǃ If this seems like a ludicrous and impractical task for the average holidaymaker, then why not try the locals' favouriteː a good rosé. Totally unlike the sweet, cheap crap many of us remember from the 1970s, traditional Provençal rosé is dry, light and acts as a perfect accompaniment to an afternoon picnic of bread and cheese. \n\nViticulture aside, the drink most endeared to the Provençal psyche is ",{"type":"'''","value":["pastis"]},", an apéritif liqueur made from anise. The many brands may be indistinguishable to outsiders but each one has a devoted local following, similar to sports teams and their fans. With an average alcohol content of 40-45%, this is strong stuff and will likely lead to some memorable nights (or not, depending on how much you indulge inǃ) \n\nFancy yourself a James Bond at heart? Sampling a ",{"type":"'''","value":["Martini"]}," (\"shaken, not stirred\" or however you like) while on a night out in the Riviera is a must.  \n\nIf alcohol isn't your thing, or if you just fancy a break from all that pastis, the region's excellent range of fruit trees yield a healthy ",{"type":"'''","value":["fruit juice"]}," crop, and French ",{"type":"'''","value":["coffee culture"]}," is ubiquitous.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nIn an emergency, dial ",{"type":"'''","value":["112"]},". \n\nIf you decide that the Provence is your place to stay, you might as well stay safe. The last 10 years have seen a sharp rise in the crime rate on Côte d'Azur, with many houses burgled. Help and information for victims of burglary and those who want to check or improve the security of their property is best done with the assistance of the local police chief. If you decide to make the Provence your base and you are looking to buy a property, you should be just as cautious as in anywhere else. Don't just buy your property without doing the necessary research.
