[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["S-amer africa default banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["otheruses"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.providenciaespasion.com\/eng\/ Providencia"]}]}," is a Caribbean island, and a part of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Andres and Providencia"]]}," Archipelago. It is politically a part of Colombia, but is geographically closer to Nicaragua. It is attached by footbridge to a smaller island, Santa Catalina.\n\nIt is a very scenic island, with lovely empty beaches, a typical Caribbean climate, laid back atmosphere and friendly people. While the island depends quite heavily on tourism, it is not at all 'touristy' and only small hotels are present. The hotels on the island resemble more \"guest lodges\" than 5 star hotels, and everything is very low key. The restaurants and bars are relatively basic, and Providencia does not have any clubs or discos.\n\nProvidencia is heavily protected by Colombian legislation - no non-native of the island is allowed to own property there, or operate a business. Thus, while many developers may want to \"build up\" Providencia, it seems unlikely that this will happen in the near future. It is quite unique in its status as an undeveloped and unexploited Caribbean island. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nSatena ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.satena.com\/"]}," and the charter airline Searca are the only current air operators, both run a couple of daily flights to Providencia from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Andrés"]]},". The flight lasts approximately 20 minutes.\n\nThere is also a catamaran (named El Sensation ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.catamaranelsensation.com\/"]},") that makes a return trip from San Andres to Providencia on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.  The cost is about 210,000 pesos, and the journey takes two and a half hours.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nThe island has one principle coastal road (which goes around the circumference of the island), and a few other smaller roads. There is no public transport to speak of, although there are (relatively expensive) taxis. Hitch-hiking is quite easy.  Another option for tourists is to rent a motorbike or golf buggy.  Providencia is a small island - it takes just 40 minutes to drive in a loop around the whole island in a golf buggy. Santa Catalina does not have any roads, there is only one footpath.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See & Do"]},"\n\nProvidencia's appeal lies in it's beautiful unspoilt volcanic scenery,  white sand beaches, crystal clear waters, scuba diving, snorkelling and fishing. \n\nBahia Aguadulce is the main tourist area of Providencia, there are 5-6 small hotels, a few restaurants and a supermarket - all of which are walking distance to the beach.\n\nIsabel Village is the main town in Providencia, it has an internet cafe, a cafe, a few supermarkets and a few miscellaneous shops. There is also a footbridge to Santa Catalina.\n\nSanta Catalina is a smaller island connected to Providencia, and is considerably less developed. It has one shop, a few beautiful beaches and a couple of restaurants.  On Santa Catalina one finds Morgans Head, a large rock formation that resembles a head and is named after the pirate Henry Morgan, who used Providencia and Santa Catalina as a base for raiding the Spanish colonial empire many centuries ago.  There are also the remains of an unexcavated Fort that dates from the days of piracy on the island.\n\nBahia Suroeste has a long calm beach with a handful of simple restaurants and bars.\n\nBahia Manzanillo is a beautiful beach with the \"Roland Roots Reggae Bar\", featuring beach-parties and live acoustic music on the weekends.\n\nCrab Caye is a beautiful small island off the East coast of the island.  The snorkelling here is excellent, and the sea an amazing shade of turquoise.   Along with the other small, beautiful islands named the Three Brothers Cayes, Crab Caye forms part of the McBean Lagoon National Park.\n\n\"The Peak\" is the highest point on the island - and offers beautiful panoramic views towards the distant barrier reef, which runs along the East coast of the island.  Excursions can be arranged by most hotels.\n\nScuba diving around Providencia is excellent - here one finds the 3rd largest barrier reef in the world.\n\n15km to the North of Providencia, at the top of the barrier reef, lies the remote little island called Low Caye, which can be visited on fishing trips.   Even further North and East lie other even more remote islands such as Roncador, and idyllic atolls such as Serrana and Serranilla.  Such remote islands aren't marked on most maps and are almost never visited by tourists.\n\nOne gets a better grasp of the island by seeing it from the sea. As such, boat tours are highly recommended.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\nBush Rum is the local type of firewater.  \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nThe vast majority of the food on offer is sea-food - lobsters, squid, fish, crab, and prawns.\n\nTry their corn flavour ice cream, made locally\n\nFor a massive bowl of seafood soup visit El Nino on SouthWest beach. All the seafood is fresh and delicious.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nAlcoholic drinks are normally limited to beer, rum and aguardiente.\n\nNormally there is live (acoustic) music every night in one of the beach bars on the island - word spreads of which bar it is by way of posters and word of mouth.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nMany of the hotels have their bookings arranged by the all inclusive hotel chain Decameron.  In addition it is possible to stay at the luxury hotel Deep Blue ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.hoteldeepblue.com"]},", Pirata Morgan Hotel, Hotel Sirius, and Sol Caribe hotel, all of whom take independent bookings. There are a handful of other small, locally run guesthouses in addition, called \"Posadas Nativas\" or Native Inns, run by the local ",{"type":"''","value":["Raizal"]}," people. These are bed and breakfast style including a homemade traditional island breakfast, and hosts speak English and Creole, which is great for international speakers who speak English and not Spanish.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["San_Andrés_and_Providencia"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Providencia Island"]]}]
