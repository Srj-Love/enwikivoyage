Perhaps due to being at the remote end of the Cape and because of its variety of beautiful scenes, Provincetown has attracted artists of all types over the years. One of the oldest artist colonies in America, it has produced a large number of excellent galleries, cutting edge theatre and many unique shops. There is also the persistence of an attitude of tolerance, making Provincetown a preferred home and travel destination for many gays and lesbians.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["\"P-town\""]},", as it is sometimes called, also has an intriguing history as the first landing site of the Pilgrims and the place where the Mayflower Compact was signed. Fishing and whaling have also been a huge part of Provincetown's past. Its large, safe harbor and prime location made it the Cape's fishing center, with thousands of ships calling it home port. The glory days of fishing are now gone and only a couple dozen ships continue the traditions. The Portuguese influence brought by the fishing era still lives in Provincetown.\n\nProvincetown is also blessed with pristine beaches and dunes on the Atlantic side.  Race Point Beach has often made the lists of top beaches in America. It is also one of the few spots on the east coast where one can watch the sun set into the water.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nAs the first stopping point of the New England settlers on the ",{"type":"''","value":["Mayflower"]},", Provincetown was a colonial port, but remained small compared to other Yankee trading towns until the 19th century.\n\nThe town became prosperous in the 1800s as a fishing and whaling center. The population was bolstered by a number of Portuguese sailors, many of whom were from the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Azores"]]},", and came to live in Provincetown after being hired to work on US ships.  Today, the town is a hub for whale watching vessels, which provide excellent opportunities to see whales.\n\nAfter the 1898 Portland Gale severely damaged the town's fishing industry, members of the town's art community took over many of the abandoned buildings. By the early decades of the 20th century, the town had acquired an international reputation for its artistic and literary output.\n\nSome of the most famous literary lights and artists who lived in Provincetown included playwrights Tennessee Williams, Eugene O'Neill, and Susan Glaspell; Artists Marsden Hartley, Robert Motherwell, Willem de Kooning, and Jackson Pollock; Norman Mailer, author, winner of the Pulitzer Prize, and co-founder of the ",{"type":"''","value":["Village Voice"]}," and beat poet Harry Kemp.  Today, the town is well-known for off-beat, queer and left of center writers and media personalities, including filmmaker John Waters; Michael Cunningham, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning ",{"type":"''","value":["The Hours"]},"; Andrew Sullivan, author, columnist for the ",{"type":"''","value":["Daily Beast"]},"; and blogger Andy Towle, poet and founder of Towleroad.com; Kate Clinton, comedian and writer; Kurt Vonnegut, writer; and Anthony Bourdain, chef, author, television host.\n\nBecause of its status as the first artist's colony in the U.S., the town has a strong ethic of tolerance which supported the development of a large gay community from the 1960s on.  Today it is quite common to see same-sex couples showing affection and one can expect to encounter men in drag, particularly on Commercial Street, which is the main string of restaurants, shops and galleries. In general, however, the town's attitude of tolerance extends to heterosexuals, who are increasingly present and are welcome in most establishments.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Read"]},"\n",{"type":"''","value":["Land's End: A Walk in Provincetown"]}," (ISBN 0609609076) by Michael Cunningham.
