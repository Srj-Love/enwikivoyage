Roman Poetovio developed into an important military, commercial, customs and administrative center. Forty thousand people lived in the Ptuj area in this period, a number never since reached. It was later burned by the Huns and occupied by the Avars and the Slavs. In the period of the Slav prince Pribina, it was incorporated into the Frankish state. Later, it became the property of the Salzburg archdiocese and experienced the Hungarian attacks. The city recovered and when city rights were granted, it was able to build a wall around the city. The first city statutes from 1376 provided the legal regulation of the city and contributed to its economic power. Sadly, this declined under the pressure of Turkish attacks and major fires, floods, and epidemics. \n\nToday, it is an important center of the lower Podravje region of Slovenia.

The membership in the Federation of European Carnival Cities (FECC) since 1991, has without any doubt helped the Ptuj carnival to distinguish itself from other carnivals and gain an international reputation. At the same time, the carnival has grown enriched by new carnival figures and concepts. If Kurentovanje used to be a one-day ethnographical-carnival event, it has grown into an eleven-day carnival festival of ethnographical, carnival and musical performances. Ptuj, traditional and carnival centre of Slovenia, combines Kurentovanje together with other carnivals or \"fašenk\" in neighbouring villages of Markovci, Cirkulane, Dornava, Videm, Cirkovci, Bukovci.\nThe word Kurentovanje derives from the traditional carnival mask Kurent or Korant, as it is sistematically called by traditionalists. The most prominent mask belongs to the so-called group of animal masks - furry masks. That means that its outfit consists of a fur coat made of different domestic animal skins (especially of sheep skin), of a chainbelt with five bells (previously, only one enormous bell), of a wooden club with a hedgehog skin at one end called \"ježevka\" to be carried in its hand.
