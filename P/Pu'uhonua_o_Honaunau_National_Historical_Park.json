Strict laws or \"kapu\" existed for each of the separate divisions.  Death was the penalty for breaking the law.  One's only option for survival was to elude your pursuers and reach the nearest puuhonua, or place of refuge.\n\nThe Royal Grounds adjacent to the pu'uhonua were a favored residence of Hawaiian chiefs. Hale-o-Keawe acted as the royal mausoleum and held the remains of 23 chiefs. It was surrounded by carved wooden images(ki'i) of the gods.The mana (spiritual power) of the remains bestowed sanctity upon this sacred area. This temple was constructed in honor of Keawe'ikekahiali'i o kamoku, the great-grandfather of Kamehameha I.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\nWhen the first Polynesians came to Hawaii, they brought with them the plants and animals they would need to make a start in the new world. In the park you can spot the shiny-leafed noni, with its pale yellow fruit. Noni was used as a tonic to treat many different ailments.\n\nYou may also notice several stone planters found around the Hale Ho'okipa Visitor Contact Station.  In this dry side of the island, the planters were used to raise crops. The stone walls protected the plants from the wind and coconut husks soaked in water were placed around the growing plants to keep the soil moist. \n\nThe fragrant pua maia with its flowers of white is a native species. It used for medicine and to help set broken bones. Growing along the lava, you may spot the lavender pohuehue, a native beach morning glory. Walk under the shade of the hala tree, whose leaves are used to weave mats and baskets.\n \nUnfortunately, many plants found in the park are invading the native ecosystem, choking out the native vegetation and damaging archeological sites.

Beginning in the mid-70s, red mangrove overran both Kaloko and Aimamkapa Ponds.  Shortly after the park acquired the lands the park staff aggressively removed the mangrove.  This was a huge undertaking and the park's example has now been widely copied on the other islands in Hawai'i.  Red mangrove has been entirely removed from the park - but the management staff constantly monitors and removes all new seedlings of this invasive weed.\n\nThe monk seal, one of only two mammals native to Hawaii, can sometimes be seen basking in the sun at the park.
