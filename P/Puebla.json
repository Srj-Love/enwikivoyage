[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"],["unesco=yes"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["translate"],["de"],["Puebla de Zaragoza"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Puebla"]}," is a city in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mexico"]]},". It is in the Puebla Valley, surrounded by volcanoes and snow-capped mountains, slightly over 110 kilometers (68 miles) south-east of Mexico City. The city proper in 2005 had a population of 1.5 million people, while the metropolitan area had a population of 2.1 million.\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThe city of Puebla is the fourth largest city in Mexico with 2.1 million inhabitants and the Capital of the State of Puebla. It was founded on April 16, 1531 as \"La Puebla de los Ángeles\". It was the first city in central Mexico founded by the Spanish conquistadors that was not built upon the ruins of a conquered Amerindian settlement. Its strategic location, halfway between the port of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Veracruz"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mexico City"]]},", made it the second most important city during the colonial period. During the seventeenth century, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz lived in the city until her confrontation with the Bishop of Puebla.\n\nThe city’s main claim to fame, however, is Cinco de Mayo, a festival commemorating the May 5, 1862 defeat of a French expeditionary army by Mexican general Ignacio Zaragoza. It was after this battle that the name of the city was changed to \"Heróica Puebla de Zaragoza\". The forts where the battle took place are a major tourist attraction of the city and the site of an annual month-long carnival marking the anniversary of the battle. The city is also famous for its cuisine, being said it is this city where \"Mole\" -a famous Mexican spicy thick sauce- was invented.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nTraveling to Puebla from Mexico City is fairly straightforward and can be accomplished via bus. There are continual bus services between Mexico City and Puebla throughout the day and night both from the TAPO terminal (also known as Terminal Oriente, located beside the San Lázaro Metro station) and from Benito Juarez International Airport.\n\nA one-way ticket on Estrella Roja or ADO from the TAPO usually runs about $110 pesos (~$9 USD) for regular direct service; a first class ticket (\"Pullman Primera Clase\" service) on Estrella Roja costs about $130 pesos (~$10.50 USD). (The extra 20 pesos or so are worth it: the first class coaches seat less people, thus less crowded, more space, more comfortable.) Buses leave for Puebla approximately every half hour from both locations. Travel time from TAPO to Puebla's CAPU is usually around 2 hours, but this time may vary by up to a full hour depending on Mexico City traffic conditions at that time of day. Taking an Estrella Roja bus from the airport costs about $200 pesos (~$18USD) for a one-way ticket or $400 pesos (~$37USD) for a roundtrip.\n\nThere are two bus terminals in Puebla: the Centro de Autobuses Puebla (CAPU), the main bus terminal, and Estrella Roja’s 4 Poniente bus terminal (only Estrella Roja buses go there) this terminal is located in downtown Puebla. Both Estrella Roja and ADO run buses to the much larger CAPU. If you’ve never visited Puebla before, the 4 poniente is your safest bet to get you to your final destination; there are secure taxis (called Top Driver Express) in which you pay the cashier and not the driver and if you choose CAPU this is a major intersection of several public transportation bus lines (known as combis or camiones) if you are going to nearby towns.\n\nAlternatively, Hermanos Serdán International Airport (PBC) is an international airport located near Puebla with direct flights from Houston TX and several cities within Mexico.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nTraveling within Puebla can sometimes be stressful as the local public transportation system is entirely privatized, leading to hundreds of bus routes, none of which are mapped out. If you know where you are going, you can ask around as to which route will take your destination, but often transfers are necessary for long-distances, which can be confusing, especially if you are not familiar with the language. The general fare rate is $6 pesos (~$0.50USD). (Safety note about buses: they are generally safe, but they tend to carry ",{"type":"[[","value":[["pickpockets"]]},", especially when crowded. Always have a hand over any bags\/backpacks that you have.) The buses generally run from about 7AM to 10PM.\n\nTaxis are, naturally, more expensive, but in Puebla they are almost always safe. They tend to run between 40-80 pesos for a ride. Negotiating a fare before entering a taxi is normal as the taxis do not carry meters in Puebla.\nIf the driver does not offer you a fare that you like, you can always just wave them off and wait for the next taxi.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Los Fuertes (Fuerte de Loreto and Fuerte de Guadalupe) - The forts, which sit atop the Cerro de Guadalupe is where the Battle of Puebla took place on May 5, 1862.
