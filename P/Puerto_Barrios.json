The bus costs Q3.00 and taxi costs Q5.00, but for tourists it may cost a little more.\n\nThere is only one route that goes from the Central Market, in Puerto Barrios; to San Agustín, in Santo Tomás de Castilla. The bus stops don't have signals most of the time, so you must have to know the place where you are coming down.\n\nTo travel more widely, taxis are best. But be careful. Taxis must have an identification number on both doors. Also, you can negotiate the payment with the driver. Most of the time, this isn't necessary; but like you don't know the city and you don't have your own car, you will have to do it sooner or later. Most of the time, a \"carrera\" will cost you between Q20 or Q50; depending on where you are going.\n\nAssaults are very common in the country, but Puerto Barrios is a relatively safe city (at the moment) but be careful with taxis at night. Take them in well illuminated places and if you can, guide them to your destination and ask them not to pick up anyone else. This will cost you a bit more, but you won't get ruined.\n\nEnglish is not widely spoken, you will have to communicate with the rest of the people by using Spanish.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nOne of the most visited places is a local river called \"Las Escobas\". Its in the cerro San Gil, outside the urban area of Puerto Barrios and Santo Tomás de Castilla. The river is famous for its crystalline water and is very cold.

If you're an adventurer and like to hike, there is a hiking trail, of course you have to be careful with the surrounding for there might be snakes and other amphibians.\n\nThe river has several natural pools, and they look like paradise.\n\nBut check the weather report before going there. If it has been raining in recent days, the water will be dirty. It's not polluted, but it isn't nice to take a bath in.\n\nIf you don't feel like traveling for a few hours then you can just stay inside the city. There you can walk to the two parks that the city has. One is located in the old part of Puerto Barrios, its name is Tecun Uman.

The \"Colombina\" has two dance floors, one is right by the entrance while the other one is on the other side. Both dance floors play different types of music, but the second dance floor plays mostly Reggaeton.

This club offers only one dance floor but they play different types of music. It has a terrace, and in the back it accommodates by having chairs and tables right near the ocean for nice breeze. \n\nThe tradition in this city is that Saturday is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Colombina Day"]},", while Sunday is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Meta Day"]},".
