You are probably better off going to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zipolite"]]}," or other nearby smaller places if you are looking for the \"hidden\" (Escondido) port.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By air"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Puerto Escondido International Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["PXM"]]},") ☎ +52 951 516 4982. You can also fly to Oaxaca (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["OAX"]]},") and then reach Puerto Escondido with Aerovega's  daily flight.\n\nAnother alternative is flying into Huatulco (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["HUX"]]},") and taking a taxi to Puerto Escondido (~90 min drive, ~US$50-60 if you negotiate in advance).\n\nShared taxis (called ",{"type":"''","value":["colectivos"]},") from the Puerto Escondido airport are cheap - about 35 pesos or USS3.50 per person- and reasonably quick. The airport is close to town, but you may have to wait a few minutes as the colectivo driver waits to get a few more passengers, or drops one or two off ahead of you.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nTuriStar and Estrella Blanca from Mexico City are the most comfortable and most expensive way to get here (500-900 pesos, 12 hr), traveling via Acapulco. These buses only leave from the South (Taxqueña) bus terminal. Other first class buses leave from both the North and South terminals, traveling via Puebla and\/or Oaxaca City, and taking several hours longer than the buses via Acapulco. The quickest (5-6 hr) service, but least comfortable transport from Oaxaca is by van (called suburban in Spanish). There are several companies (140 pesos). More comfortable but longer are the buses leaving from the 2nd class bus station. Do not take a 1st class bus because the trip is over 15 hr - it takes the longest route. 2nd class buses take around 7-8 hr. There are also many buses from Acapulco.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nDriving to Puerto Escondido is only advisable if you have experience with windy, poorly-maintained mountain roads. That said, it is an exhilarating, scenic drive from any direction. The roads that connect Puerto Escondido to Acapulco and Oaxaca are both narrow, twisty 2-lane roads in poor condition, that traverse the sparsely populated Western Sierra Madre. Driving your own car will not save you much time over taking the bus.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe fixed price for a taxi in town is 20 pesos and 40 pesos for the airport and Bacocho beach. The local bus is 3 pesos. Night rates are 30 pesos. Be aware some taxis will charge 40 pesos if you do not specify 30 pesos before the ride.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Budget Rent-A-Car"]},", charge hefty rental fees for their fleet of subcompact manual transmission cars.

Also a good place from which to watch over breakfast when there's a surf competition on.\n\nPlaya Carrizalillo is a good beach for swimming or learning surfing with few restaurants.\n\nThe Andador is the path around the lighthouse.  It is a fun walk, and beautiful, but the surf can be dangerous in spots.\n\nThe best and safest beach for swimming is Playa Carizalillo.  Take a taxi unless you want a half-hour walk.  Carizalillo is small, gorgeous, and not too crowded, 167 steps from street level down to the beach (then back up again). There are some surfers and some boats, but mainly swimmers enjoying the waves.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Surf"]}," You can even take lessons if you're a beginner - try one of the friendly surf instructors on any beach or at one of the surf shops.

A few tour operators run similar trips out into the Pacific in search of the animals. More often than not, you get a glimpse of the turtles and, if you're lucky enough, the tour guide sometimes jumps in and catches hold of one! Unperturbed, the creatures come onto the boat for some photos and free food courtesy of the tour guide. It's kind of surreal, but incredible. Less often, you will get to see the packs of dolhpins arching over the surface. Again, it is an amazing experience and well worth the money (around 300 pesos on average)."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Fishing"]}," Another good ocean-based activity is the regular fishing trips you can go on. For the keen fisherman, this is a dream activity. The waters host vast amounts of species of fish including tuna, marlin and red snapper.
