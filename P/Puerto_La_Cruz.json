Bus leaves every hour or so until 10:30PM. Any local will be able to direct you to the closest terminal. You can also take the Metro (Subway) and get off at \"Colegios de Ingenieros\" station. Once you go upstairs you will see the bus terminal. Is very obvious. \n\nThe bus ride is 6 hours and the temperature in the bus is kept pretty chilly, so take a sweatshirt.\n \nIf you went for the bus you will arrive at the bus terminal right in downtown Puerto La Cruz. This is not the best part of town, so standard warnings apply.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nSo you made it to Puerto La Cruz and now you are ready to do some tourism. The best, fastest and safest way to get around in Puerto La Cruz is by taxi. A fare can go for $5-$10, which is ten times more expensive than the local bus, but it will save you time and the hassle of trying to figure out which bus to take to go where. Many times even the locals have a hard time trying to figure it out. Plus most of the buses are really old and uncomfortable. \n\nWhen taking a taxi, always make sure you use \"legal\" taxis. They are usually marked with the name of the cab company. Illegal taxis will look like any other car and they are usually really beat up.

The bus terminal is not tourist friendly, so it is not easy to find out where to buy your ticket but all the counters have their destination literally \"painted\" in their windows, and most likely you will have more than one person around you trying to help you out.\n\nPuerto La Cruz boasts some of the most beautiful beaches in the country. You can get to many different beaches by land and by boat. Is all a matter of personal preference. The islands have white-sand-clear-water beaches, land-side beaches have brown-sand-clear-water beaches. \n\nTo go to the islands you need to go to Paseo Colon where you will see the boat stations, one on the west end and one on east end of Paseo Colon. Prices changes every year and they supposedly leave every 30mins. Sometimes you have to be a little bit pushy because they will wait as long as possible trying to get more customers.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Paseo Colon"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Andres Eloy Bianco Park"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Laguna Natural Maguey"]},{"type":"*","value":[" La Toma"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nBeach, party, girls, guys, ... what else do you need?\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Spanish Language Schools."]}," Playa Colorada, 30 minutes along the coast, is a famous Venzuelan beach (photo in many of the guide books) and a good location to learn Spanish.

Make sure you try EVERYTHING. You can also find really good authentic Italian, Mediterranean, Spanish, Chinese restaurants. Mexican food is not very popular so eat your burrito when you go back home. Among the most popular Venezuela meal\/dishes you should try:\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Empanadas:"]}," These are made of corn flour based dough and are deep fried. The stuffing varies according to the region; most common are the cheese and ground beef empanadas. Other types use fish, \"caraotas\" or black beans, oyster, clams and other types of seafood popular in the coastal areas.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Arepas:"]}," The arepa is a corn-based dish from the northern Andes in South America, now spread to other areas in modern Latin American countries. It is basically a flat (the flatness varies) cake of cornmeal which is then grilled, baked or fried. It is often split in half and filled with cheese, deli meats, and a great variety of fillings, in which case it is known as arepa rellena. This more elaborate version may be eaten closed like a sandwich, or dressed with toppings and eaten open-faced. This is the most frequent form it adopts in Venezuela.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Pabellon Criollo:"]}," Pabellón criollo is a traditional Venezuelan dish. It is a plate of rice, shredded beef and stewed black beans. Optionally, one may request Tajadas (fried plantain slices) or a fried egg as additions. Because of the frequency of these requests, they have both gained name in Venezuelan slang. A Pabellón con barandas (Baranda is Spanish for guard rail) is served with tajadas because the long plantain slices placed on the sides are humorously considered as keeping the food from falling out of the plate. A Pabellón a caballo (a caballo is Spanish for horseback riding) means with a fried egg on top, as if \"riding\" the dish. So most waiters understand inmediately what a Pabellón con barandas y a caballo means.\n\nThe shredded beef can be replaced by Chigüire (capybara) Caimán (Alligator) shredded meat or even freshwater fish, depending on particular tastes, region or time of the year (beef consumption is prohibited by the Catholic church during easter time, however Chigüire or fish is approved).\n\nIt is widely considered by many as the Venezuelan national dish.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Cachapa:"]}," Cachapas are a part of traditional Venezuelan cuisine. They are made of maize in the form of masa. They are made as fresh corn is ground and then mixed into a batter of the consistency of pancakes, yet slightly thicker and lumpier. It is then cooked like a pancake. It is served with many toppings, but traditionally with butter or margarine and white cheese (queso blanco) on top. Cachapas are generally eaten instead of bread, but they can be also prepared as an appetizer or a full breakfast, depending on the size. Cachapas could be very elaborate, some including different kinds of cheese, milky cream, and jam.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Tequeno:"]}," A tequeño is prepared with a bread dough with white cheese (queso blanco) in the middle. It is formed into a bread stick and then fried. It is one of the most popular Venezuelan snack foods in parties, especially weddings. It is said that a party is not a true Venezuelan party without tequeños.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Toston:"]}," Tostones are a dish made from sliced green plantain(s) which are cut either length-wise or width-wise and are twice fried. The first step is to heat the oil on medium for a few minutes. Once it's hot enough, one cooks both sides for 1-2 minutes each side until they are golden brown in color. One then removes them, pat dry excess oil, pounds them flat with one's fist or any kitchen utensil that has a flat surface, and fry them once again until they are lightly crisp and somewhat brown in color. They are salted and eaten much like potato chips. You can have them with a side of Cubed Steak in Onions, and also a Side Salad\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nDon't miss the opportunity of drinking real fruit juice. Whether you go to a restaurant or in the streets is always safe and healthier to drink juice. There are many options. Just ask for your favorite tropical fruit.\n\nThere is also Malta. Malta is a type of soft drink. It is a carbonated malt beverage, meaning it is brewed from barley and hops much like beer. However, malta is non-alcoholic.
