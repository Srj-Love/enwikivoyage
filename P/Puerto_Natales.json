[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Puerto Natales banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:PtoNatales(Chile).jpg"],["thumb"],["550px"],["Flamingos in Ultima Esperanza Bay"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Puerto Natales"]}," is a town in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chile"]]},", the gateway to trekking in Torres del Paine or Bernardo O'Higgins National Parks. It offers good infrastructure, especially a few trekking shops (although you'd do better to get your gear in Punta Arenas) and not-so-cheap supermarkets. Since 2009 the two larger supermarkets (Unimarc and Don Bosco) have increased their stocking of foods that are needed by trekkers\/backpackers, including lightweight soups, precooked \"ramen\" noodles, hard cheeses, gorp components (dried fruits and nuts), Snickers bars, and powdered drinks. However, freeze-dried products are not to be found.\n\nPuerto Natales features a couple of characteristics that visitors should be aware of. One is that the population is largely descended from immigrants from Chiloé, and the \"chilote\" tendencies (cooking, building style) are evident. Another characteristic is that there are very strong Communist\/Leftist affiliations in this town, so take this into account by being careful with your conversations involving related politics. Aside from the chilotes, you will find many surnames of British and Croatian descent.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Understand "]},"\n\nAlthough not of very high interest as itself, Puerto Natales is an ideal basis for a trek in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Torres del Paine National Park"]]},".
