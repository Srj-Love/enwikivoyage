The (BR-174) which connects the Orinoco towns of Ciudad Bolivar and Ciudad Guayana (or Puerto Ordaz) to Brazil. Buses run this route regularly. Puerto Ordaz is Venezuela's fastest growing town and is known for some spectacular waterfall parks within the city itself. The visitor infrastructure is still young but the university has long provided a good audience for interesting restaurants and nightspots. San Felix is the colonial town but has no historic building of note and contains the poorer sections of the sprawling urban area. Puerto Ordaz was founded in 1952 as an iron ore port.\n\nMany industries have settled in it, since its geographical position gives it many advantages, but the mining and particularly iron being its main industry. The iron ore  is transformed into high grade iron ore pellets in local factories. The bulk of the areas production is exported. The state of Bolivar is also rich in bauxite, gold, diamonds and various kinds of clays for brick production.\n\nSince its foundation it has grown from two fledgling towns into the Guayana region's most important  industrial center, and a hub of growth in a typically under populated region of Venezuela. The city stretches 40 kilometers along the south bank of the Orinoco. With approximately 1,300,000 people, it is a large city by Venezuelan standards. It is also the country's fastest-growing city, due to its important iron industry. It is also one of Venezuela's five most important ports, since most goods produced in Bolívar are shipped through it into the Atlantic Ocean, via the Orinoco river.\n\nThe Caroní River is a major river of the Orinoco basin in South America, having its source in South Eastern Venezuela, in the Guiana Highlands. It is a blackwater river, with the dark color of the water due to leaching from decomposed plant sediments, not from the amount of iron around the riverbed as is often suggested. The Caroní river meets with the Orinoco river and merges into it for approximately 13km. The two rivers meet where Ciudad Guayana (city of Guiana) now exists. This city was created by the fusion of old cities of San Felix and Puerto Ordaz, on either side of the river. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nThere are several flights per day that link Puerto Ordaz with the capital Caracas (airlines Aserca, Aeropostal, Rutaca) with an estimated duration of 50 minutes.
