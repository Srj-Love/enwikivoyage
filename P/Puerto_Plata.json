It is capital of the province of Puerto Plata.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nKnown for its pretty sandy beaches, Puerto Plata is a popular resort destination as well as a great place to meet Dominican people and to shop in local commerce.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Gregorio Luper√≥n International Airport"]}," (also: ",{"type":"'''","value":["Puerto Plata Airport"]},") (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["POP"]]},"). Daily flights to most North American cities. POP is located about 15 minutes east of downtown Puerto Plata.\n\nAs with other airports in the Dominican Republic, a $10USD (December 2011) fee for a tourist card will be required upon arrival. You'll buy it at one window and immediately turn around and hand it to an attendant to be scanned and dropped into a box. A $20USD departure tax is collected when you fly out.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThere are several options for local transportation between the city proper and the surrounding hotels and resorts.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Taxis"]}," are the most expensive option and not really more secure than other choices.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Buses"]}," are slower, but the cheapest, and, once you understand the routes, the easiest way to get around.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Guagua"]}," are simple minivan for normally 7-8 persons that can be easily packed to 22 persons and 2 roosters! Guagua are the main common transportation system but not really organised; you can stop practically anywhere along the main streets and wait for one to stop and climb up, the fare is normally cheap, but you'll probably have to negotiate with the driver or the door operator. Guagas can often be identified by \"Se venda\" stickers on the windows and a large rear view mirror pasted to the back door.\n\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.dominicanaaaairporttransfers.com Dominican Airport Transfers"]}," Offers airport transfers from the airport to any location in Puerto Plata, Sosua, Cabarete, Rio San Juan and Samana area.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Propinas"]},".  Much has been written about Propinas in the surrounding areas of Puerto Plata (to get a better idea who these people are see ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Sosua"]]}]}," ).  The same general rules must apply here.  The difference is that some of the ones here will take the \"con man\" approach.  One typical example is that you will be approached by a friendly individual who will pretend to be an employee at your resort, based on looking at the wristband you wear, given to you at the hotel.  They can be very knowledgeable about your resort when asking them any questions, and so it is easy to see how they may win your confidence.\n\nAt first they will say how he\/she does not need any of your money and how they will protect you from aggressive vendors.  They will show you around various landmarks (mostly upon request) and they will help you bargain at local shops (sometimes at very good deals).  Some time after when they feel the dust has already settled in, they will begin to pluck at the heartstrings (talking about how his\/her parents needs medication, or how his\/her baby needs milk, etc.) so you may feel obligated to give them some money when they do ask for it(usually $30 - $60 USD, which is WELL ABOVE THE PROPINA GOING RATE!).  Even if you offer to buy the items yourself at the store you are already in, they will insist on taking the money instead.  Soon afterwards, they will direct you to the bus station which will lead you back to the resort, and most of the times you will never see this individual again!\n\nGeneral rule of thumb:  If you do not recognize the individual at all it is best to ignore them (perhaps by pretending to not understand them at all by replying in gibberish).  However, if you do not speak Spanish and if you are lost, Propinas may be your only hope in directing you on how to get back, even if their company is at a staggering cost.  If you do recognize an employee outside of your hotel, make sure YOU are the one who approaches that person first.  And if you know exactly where you are going, just simply ignore them.  Or if you are well-versed in Spanish but a little lost, it is better to ask around from someone else who seems less shady as there can be helpful individuals not looking to dig into your wallet. Don't be played for a fool.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Motoconcho"]}," or motorcycle taxis can be recognized by their yellow vests. They are a cheaper alternative to taxis if you are comfortable with being a passenger on 2-wheels. They often congregate around \"destination\" areas like airports, markets.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Motorcycle\/Scooter"]}," Rentals of two-wheeled vehicles is possible. The rate should be about $25USD\/day. Be sure that you have experience with a motorcycle or scooter, the road surfaces are poorly maintained and the driving style is very hectic. Drivers very rarely observe stop signs, even red lights are \"optional\". A license is not necessary to operate a motorcycle or scooter and as such, the skill levels vary widely. Trucks and other large vehicles often overtake unsafely in corners and low visibility stretches of road, so you may be forced into a ditch! License plates are applied to scooters but not motorcycles. It is very common for overtaking vehicles to announce their presence to a scooter or motorcycle by honking, try not to be startled by this! Helmets are seldom used (some motoconchos wear them), but you may have difficulty getting a rental helmet, and it most certainly will not fit properly. Inspect your scooter or motorcycle before renting. Also, most bikes are small displacement compared to other parts of the world. Most are under 200cc and are 2-stroke.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Car"]}," Cars are more expensive to rent and very likely to be damaged, as the Dominican mentality is \"no big deal\", count on no one having insurance. Prices are around $60USD\/day for a 4WD style vehicle.\n\nIf you are renting your own vehicle keep in mind what type of fuel it uses. Natural gas (propane) is popular and the natural gas stations seem to outnumber petrol stations. Obviously the two are incompatible, don't strand yourself thinking that you can go to any station and get the fuel that you need!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" See "]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Cristo Redentor"],["alt=Monument at the top of Parque Nacional Isabel de Torres"],["url="],["email="],["address=Parque Nacional Isabel de Torres"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=$10USD"],["content=Take a funicular to the top of the mountain that sits behind Puerto Plata to see a replica of the original located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Fort San Felipe"],["alt=Located at the edge of Puerto Plata bay"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=$??"],["content=Historical fort located by the main bay of Puerto Plata.
