Stretching from the south end of Old Town to central downtown, a newly extended and refurbished boardwalk along the ocean, called the Malecon, passes by any number of shops, restaurants, and hotels, and often plays host to mimes, breakdancers, clowns and artists.\n\nThe residents of Puerto Vallarta are very friendly and generally willing to help with directions and other requests. Old TownVallarta (or the Zona Romantica district) south of the River Cuale is more like a Mexican town and less like a tourist trap.\n\nEnglish is widely spoken, and as a tourist destination prices are higher than many other places in Mexico. Puerto Vallarta is very crowded at holiday times, if planning a visit to Mexico that coincides with a major holiday consider opting to visit ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mexico City"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guadalajara"]]}," instead.

Most major US airlines serve the airport along with Aeromexico. It has been recently remodeled, though waits can still occur when more than two flights have landed.\nNote that the arrival area is plagued by timeshare hucksters.  They will offer to arrange a cab for you and try to rope you into a timeshare sales presentation.  After you clear customs, walk quickly through the next room - the one housing the hucksters - continue walking past the rope-line.  Now look for the official taxi kiosk out in the main airport atrium.  You purchase your taxi trip here.  All other offers of cab rides you will receive between customs and the kiosk will be from timeshare hucksters.  Ignore every one of them.  The bad experience of those taken in can ruin one's first hours in PVR, and that would be a shame. Or hire private transportation.\n\nIf you've packed lightly you can take the city buses into town. Continue straight ahead as you exit the arrivals area and exit the doors in front of you.  The bus stop is to your left, under the pedestrian overpass (1\/4 block from the airport door).  Wait for a bus (5 minutes or so) marked Centro (but NOT marked Pitillal or Bobadilla), wave it down, pay your M$6.50 pesos, and enjoy the ride. The bus stops all throughout the town. It takes about 20 to 30 minutes for the bus to get to its farthest southerly stop. You've just saved $20! You don't need exact change for the bus. Drivers will make change for bills $50.00 pesos & smaller.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nThere are modern, well maintained toll roads all the way from the border, other roads are not as well maintained, but are still suitable for the drive.

Some stop at various beaches. You are even able to go horseback riding up to a waterfall at one beach south of Puerto Vallarta. Major cruise ships loaded with thousands of tourists from the United States as well as Europe dock in the city's main port typically spending an entire day there.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nThe main bus station is north of town, past the airport.\n\nPuerto Vallarta buses go to the north or south, you can take a bus to Tijuana or Mexico City that connect to the south.\n\nLuxury lines as ETN and ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/secure.primeraplus.com.mx\/fapweb\/primeraplus Primera Plus"]}," runs many buses from the principle cities as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guadalajara"]]}," (also stopping at the western Zapopan terminal). If you are traveling in a peak holiday period booking ahead is not essential the bus companies will schedule extra buses.\n\nSecond class buses run from coastal towns throughout.\n\nTo catch a local bus into town, exit the bus station and keep walking across the parking area.  Then walk to your right toward the corner.  The city buses will stop here. Any bus you pick up here will take you all the way down to the \"Romantic Zone\", about a half an hour drive, for just M$6.50! Although not really known to tourists, the buses are one of the best ways to mingle with the locals, as well as getting a nice view of town.\n\nIt is possible to walk between the airport and the bus station, however catching a city bus is a cheap and reliable option.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nHotels may provide a price list for cabs (expect to pay about 50 pesos for short trips, and 200 for longer trips). Hotels will also offer (expensive) transport from airport to hotel., but it is much better to take a taxi. If you've booked with a travel agency, they will most likely provide you with transportation to and from the airport.\nBe prepared for fast speeds, as the cab drivers have schedules to adhere to. Many of the cabs do not have working seatbelts or speedometers as well. Taxi drivers tend to gather at the intersection close to the liquor outlet in the Centro District. They are friendly and you can negotiate trips outside of Puerto Vallarta at a very reasonable cost on slow days. They will wait for you while you dine or shop as well as photograph you and your mates. Include a small tip with the very reasonable fare.\n\nTip: From the airport, there are two types of taxis available to get you to where you are going. The white federal taxis are available immediately upon exiting the airport but are more expensive. Cross the pedestrian bridge over the highway for the cheaper yellow taxis that are more common in other parts of the city.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Local trips"]}," "]},"Bus trips cost around 6.00 pesos, which is about 50 US cents (0.35 Euro) that you pay to the bus driver when you get in and every ride is good for as long as you have to stay on... the whole city if you'd like. It is easy to find a bus stop. You will see large amounts of people loitering on the sidewalk. If you wait a few minutes, a bus will stop as they run quite frequently. Look for your travel location on the bus windshield. Buses stop almost every five to ten blocks and at peak hours tend to get very full & can get very hot, so be ready for that.  If you are a man, be ready to give up your seat to women if the bus becomes crowded. Bus drivers will make change for any amount up to 50.00 pesos, but won't break larger bills. (these prices updated August 2010)\n\nThe buses are very reliable quite handy to get to places like Pitillal (the rapidly growing suburb to the NE) and Ixtapa (including the nearby U of Guadalajara campus with its gallery and crocodile farm).  They are also useful for travelling from the hotel zone and marina area to the downtown or old-town areas.  Any bus marked Centro will pass through both. Buses marked Tunel will skip downtown and head directly to the old-town \/ zona romantica via the tunnel bypass.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Out of town trips"]}]},"You can visit Bucerias for 12 pesos, $.85. You can also go to Punta Mita for 20 pesos, $1.50. Mismaloya buses charge around 6 pesos. There are also larger buses that can take you to Guadalajara, which is about a 5-hour trip.\n\nYou can catch buses for Mismaloya along Basilio Badillo on the corner just West of where you see them lined up.\n\nThe easiest way to catch a bus to Bucerias, Punta Mita or points in between is to catch a city bus to Wal-Mart\/Sams.  Walk along the main road to the northernmost bus shelters in front of Wal-Mart. The buses to Bucerias leave from here.\n\nIf you want to catch a bus south to Barra de Navidad or any of the towns south to Costa Allagre, you can catch the bus at the corner of [Dieguez & Aguacate] at the south end of town. Busses leave at 6AM & 9AM. Look for the blue bust stop sign. You will have to pay the driver in Peso's (fares vary on distance). Just tell the driver where or when you want to get off the bus.

There are many different ways to explore the Bay.\n\nTo the South, the hills cascade towards the sea creating a rich palette that mixes the vivid green foliage with the deep blues of the water. At their feet nestle secluded coves and small fishing villages, many of which are still accessible only by sea.\n\nTo the East, the jungle clad Sierra Madre Mountains, which quickly rise to over 8,000 feet, encircle and protect the town from the winds and regulate the semi-tropical and humid weather.\n\nAnd, to the West, the Bay of Banderas is home to a wide variety of aquatic life. Humpback whales come here to mate every year from December to March, and sea turtles nest on the beaches from May to October. Schools of dolphins and giant manta rays also inhabit these waters.

Do not trust that your guide has made a good decision, he will be gone with your tip long before you show any symptoms.  Restaurants listed in reputable tour guides are a fairly safe bet.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Chez Elena"]}," Famous hotel and restaurant located in Puerto Vallarta.
