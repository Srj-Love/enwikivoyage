[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Puerto Viejo de Talamanca banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["otheruses"],["Puerto Viejo"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Puerto Viejo de Talamanca"]}," is a small coastal town in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Caribbean Costa Rica"]]}," in the province of Limón. It is popular with surfers and backpackers. This is an area where foreigners are buying and building. There are two gorgeous National Parks nearby - Cahuita and Manzanillo, and it rains more than on the Pacific side, which is why it is so lush and green with the rainforest coming down to the sea.\n\nClear water, coconut palms, great surf and a laid-back Caribbean atmosphere make Puerto Viejo a favorite among travelers. Located on the Caribbean Coast, about an hour south of Limon, Puerto Viejo is the center of activity between the smaller villages of Cahuita and Manzanillo. The relaxed, seaside town is framed by jungle, turquoise seas, banana plantations and scenic rivers.\n\nFormerly a small fishing village, Puerto Viejo has grown rapidly in recent years. Avid surfers, drawn to the famous Salsa Brava waves, have made Puerto Viejo a hotspot on the surfing circuit. The center of town now has many souvenir and surf shops, bars, restaurants, hotels and tour companies. True to its beach location and Caribbean ambiance, bikes and pedestrians dominate road traffic along the coastal roads.\n\nWith its blend of Afro-Caribbean descendants, expat Europeans and indigenous Costa Ricans, Puerto Viejo charms visitors with a unique mix of people and cultures. Rastafari culture has a firm foothold in the town, and many Rastas sell handmade jewelry and other wares along the town’s vibrant roadside.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nBefore the Spanish arrival, the Bribri, Kekoldi and Cabecar indigenous peoples were the primary inhabitants of Costa Rica’s southern Caribbean. Later, Afro-Caribbean immigrants arrived, many from Jamaica, and settled in the coastal towns of Puerto Viejo, Punta Uva, Manzanillo and Monkey Point. Because of their influence, many Puerto Viejo natives today speak English as their first language.\n\nUntil the late 1970s, Puerto Viejo was relatively isolated from the rest of Costa Rica. In 1979, a new road connected the small village to San Jose and the Central Valley. In 1986, electricity arrived, supplying light and other important conveniences to the town. Private phone lines became available in 1996, and high-speed internet was offered in 2006. Today, Puerto Viejo is as modern as any beach town, though it still retains its original charm.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe local bus leaves 4-5 times a day direct from San Carlos Station in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San José (Costa Rica)"],["San José"]]},".

However, you really don't need a car when you are here.  Most people rent bicycles and scooters.  The roads may not be all paved, but they are flat as they all follow beach line.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe bus system is very limited. Busing between the beaches can be very hard with one every 4 hours sometimes. Even a 15 minute taxi ride can be $8, as expensive as most western nations. Most lodges have bicycles for rent. Taxis hang out in the center of town and will take you anywhere you want to go up and down the coast.  When taking a taxi, make sure to negotiate your price ahead of time.  Most of the taxi drivers know the area extremely well and can find their way with just the name of your hotel.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nTropical forest surrounds the village and palm trees line the beach, adding to Puerto Viejo’s natural beauty. Travelers can glimpse spectacular wildlife in Cahuita National Park or the Gandoca-Manzanillo National Wildlife Refuge, which border the town to its north and south, respectively.\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Just south of Puerto Viejo"]},", visitors will discover the sublime beaches of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Playa Cocles, Playa Chiquita and Punta Uva."]}," The dirt road connecting the villages is often in poor shape and full of potholes, though road repair vehicles labor daily to improve conditions. Beachfront cabins, restaurants and shops line the street, almost all the way to Manzanillo. There is no shortage of accommodations in the area; numerous budget hostels cater to surfers and young backpackers that frequent the area, while posh resorts offer comfort and luxury along with impressive ocean views.\n\nBlack and white sand beaches extend for miles; they are wide and often deserted, offering stretches ideal for walking and sunbathing. Snorkeling is excellent when the water is calm, and nearby Cahuita and Manzanillo are home to beautiful, living coral reefs that provide some of the best snorkeling in Costa Rica.\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["The beaches are gorgeous"]},", but like everywhere in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Central America"]]},", watch those riptides."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["There are beautiful birds, butterflies and animals"]}," to be seen."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=There is also the Iguana Conservation Tour"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.iguanaverde.com\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=At Iguana Verde Foundation, you can check the tour futures at '"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Refugio de gandoca de Manzanillo"]},":the beauty of this refuge is incredible because of its forest, lagoons, coral, reefs and white  sand beaches and is the most exotic place of the entire South Caribbean coast.
