The price of a buscard is 30kn but they usually sell them for 70kn since they are prefilled with 40kn you can use on the bus. The BusCard reduces drastically the price of the ride making it a 6kn per hour on the city lines (lines 1 to 9). Also, up to 5 people can use the same BusCard at the same moment, for the same bus.

The service is charged separately from the ticket and it usually costs 7kn.
