Thus a 2 on the meter is actually Rs (10*2 + 1) = Rs 21. Or a 3.50 on the meter is Rs (3.5*10 + 1) = Rs 36.\n\nThe driver may occasionally stop to ask for directions depending on how familiar he is with the area. All rickshaws plying in the Municipal Corporation limits are supposed to charge fare according to tariff card. Most of the times they will try to charge you a little extra but that won't be too much. You can very well argue with them based on the conversion equation stated above, and sometimes they will agree to it.\n\nNowadays, many auto rickshaw drivers try to charge extra for long distances or very short distances, or they refuse the fare. If they realise you are not from the city, they may try to take longer routes to the destination to charge extra money from you. Thus, outsiders and foreigners, use your own judgement before boarding any auto rickshaw. Stick to the demand of charging by meter and refuse strongly to pay any extra amount, unless it is midnight. Autorickshaw drivers may also refuse to travel to quite a few parts of the city as per their convenience; however, this is against the law if their meter reads \"on hire\" in the upright position. If the sign is turned sideways, the rickshaw driver is not technically working and can refuse you.\n\nIt is very common for rickshaw drivers plying between 11PM and 6AM to demand 1.5 times the normal rates for the journey. You are advised to get this cleared with the driver before boarding the rickshaw. It is also sometimes advisable to flag a rickshaw from the streets (if practical and possible) instead of boarding one from the stands as often, rickshaw drivers waiting in stands demand more fare.\n\nIf you have complaints against auto drivers for not accepting short distance rides (or any rides), asking more meter fare, not using a meter, taking other passengers along the way, carrying more passengers than allowed capacity, stopping at bus stands or other similar complaints of serious nature, you can email or call the Road Transport Authorities at 020-22051414 or 020-27492828 (PCMC) or email rtopune@dataone.in. Traffic cops usually come right away to the spot to book a complaint against the driver. Commuters can also send their MMS pictures at +91 9420218338. The complaints should clearly mention all details including the auto’s registration number, the time of taking the rickshaw, details of auto fare, the distance commuted, locations, date, time, nature of complaint.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By two-wheelers"]},"\nThis city was once known as the ",{"type":"'''","value":["city of bicycles"]},", but now it has turned into the ",{"type":"'''","value":["city of motorcycles"]},".

Lane discipline is generally tough to follow because of this reason. The general attitude towards riding motorbikes in the city is that of total ignorance of any set forth traffic regulations along with complete disregard of one's safety (not wearing a helmet). Here people ride motorbikes as if they are riding a war horse and will generally try to overtake every vehicle in front. Minor accidents on motorbikes are common; You are advised to be careful even when your signal is green as the traffic flow from other direction generally does not stop immediately.\n\nPune's roads might turn to horrid potholes from smooth tarmac in matter of seconds when it rains. Always be on a lookout. If you are driving a car always be careful, since motorbike riders may overtake you from left or right and cut lanes without warning. Of late, there has been an improvement by addition of a number of bicycle tracks all over.\n\nThat said, if you do want to hire a two wheeler, there are two outfits who rent '2 wheels' in Pune. A 100cc Bajaj Platina will cost 200 INR a day and an automatic Honda scooter will cost 300 INR. If you are planning on day trips from Pune you would be best with the larger wheels and light weight of a motorcycle rather than a scooter.

Total distance is about 220km and will take 6 hours just to drive the loop, with lunch and sightseeing added on. The full trip could take up to 12 hours so leave a full day. It is suggested that this trip is undertaken either by motorcycle or 4WD due to the state of some of the roads that are encountered. It is possible to make the journey in a regular car (and many do - even auto ricks) but it will take longer and there will be a heavy toll on the cars suspension. To be as safe as possible you would also want some experience on driving on broken\/ unsurfaced roads and dealing with the challenges of driving in India.\n\nLeave Pune on the National Highway 9 (Pune Solapur Highway) which passes the racecourse. This is a toll road and also very busy with cars and trucks. If you have taken a motorcycle be very careful.\n\nThe turn off to Bhuleshwar is about 35km from Pune and shortly after the second toll booth (about 2km before Yavat village). A concrete bridge crosses a canal and the turn off is to the right just before the bridge. There is no sign in English, but there is a sign to Deccan Industrial Explosives pte. After 5km or so the road will climb into some ghats, where the road becomes quite broken. Once you reach the top of the ghats you will see the temple and a prominent radio mast to the right. The turn to the temple is the next right, the road becomes quite steep at some points.\n\nAfter visiting the temple and fort (allow 30 to 40 mins), return to the road and turn right where you turned off. This road will take you to Saswad (or Sasvad on some maps). There are several turnoffs, keep heading west, but also plenty of people to ask the way, nearly everyone knows Saswad. The scenery is quite flat though enlivened by scenes of Indian rural life. The road is paved but quite rough. You can take lunch when you reach the town.\n\nThereafter, ask the way for Purandar itself or Nasrapur which is where the road goes. Many people know it. The road is the Diwale to Narayanpur road. In fact the hill itself is easy to spot as it towers above ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Narayanpur"]]},". After 5km after the turnoff from you will reach a left fork which is signed (not in English). Take this and follow the twisty road to Purandar. At time of writing (October 09) the majority of the road is totally unsurfaced (awaiting surfacing) so would be muddy during rain and there is also the possibility of dealing with the resurfacing activity. Allow 30 minutes to enjoy the views and look at the abandoned army buildings and another 1.5 hours to climb to the top and explore.\n\nIt will take about 15 minutes to regain the main ro phone=ad if you have a motorbike. Turn left when you reach it and enjoy the smooth tarmac and twists of the road as you pass between the two hills. Eventually you will reach National highway 4 (also a toll road), turn right and again pay attention to the road hazards.\n\nApproximately 12km later at Khed take a left turn towards Shivapur. Pass through towards Kondapur, where you take a right fork, thereafter at the T-junction take the left which leads to Sinhagad Fort.\n\nIn terms of time to spend here it is best to gauge your stamina and enthusiasm against the amount of light you have left, as it is better to end the journey in daylight rather than drive at night.\n\nRetrace your steps to NH4 and then follow this back to Pune. You will arrive in the Bibvewadi area in the south of the city.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bhuleshwar"]},"-a very beautiful 1100 year old hill temple near Yavat in the Saswad region.

Violent crime is low, although it's important to keep an eye on your belongings in public, as petty theft can occur. Do report any such activity to the police. Keep away from the touts.\n\nLocals are by and large friendly and mild mannered, though incidents of mugging have been reported on the outskirts of Pune, especially on highways and desolate stretches. If you face a vehicle breakdown after dark, its best to stay in the vehicle and phone for help.\n\nAlthough Pune is generally safe for women, it's advisable not to venture out alone into dark and isolated places. Hiring cabs at night without one or more companions is not recommended. Climbing the surrounding hills alone is tempting but unwise-and this goes for both sexes! Having said that, women can confidently walk the streets or visit the shops\/pubs\/restaurants in the popular residential or commercial areas after sunset.\n\nDriving in Pune is not for the weak-hearted. Like other Indian metros, Pune has seen an virtual explosion in traffic in recent years, and the infrastructure is struggling to keep pace. Lack of discipline especially during overtaking and driving on the wrong side is rampant in the city and on highways. Its common to see rude and impatient drivers at intersections honking away at pedestrians. Enforcement of traffic rules leaves a lot to be desired, unlike Mumbai or other major cities. Road conditions deteriorate especially in heavy traffic areas during monsoon. According to recent reports (2008), 1,617 persons suffered injuries and 477 fatalities in road accidents occurred in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. If you are driving, its a good idea to drive defensively. Be courteous to fellow motorists and maintain lane discipline.
