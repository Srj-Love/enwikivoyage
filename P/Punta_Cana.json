It also borders ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cabeza de Toro"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cabo Engaño"]]}," and further west, Juanillo. \n\nDespite the area being fairly deserted, the proximity of Punta Cana to other major resort areas such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bávaro"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Uvero Alto"]]}," make the town one of the top ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Caribbean"]]}," destinations. \n\nPeak season in Punta Cana tends to run from December-April. Prices in both airfare and hotel increase dramatically during these times, while dropping in the summer and early fall months.\n\nPunta Cana has a tropical climate. Although it is mildly windy, the ocean in the area is mainly shallow, with several natural marine pools in which visitors can bathe. The weather is fairly constant, with an average temperature of 26°C. The hottest season lasts from April to November, and during the day temperatures might reach 32°C. From December to March, temperatures during the evening are around 20°C. Very little rain falls around the area, mostly because of the flat landscape. The summer months tend to be very warm and very humid. It is suggested you wear loose fitting, cotton clothing, so pack light.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nSeveral US carriers have scheduled flights to  ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.puntacanainternationalairport.com ",{"type":"'''","value":["Punta Cana International Airport"]}]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["(PUJ"]]},")including: Jet Blue, American Airlines, Spirit Airlines, Frontier Airlines, USA 3000, United, US Airways and Delta.

Just look for your hotel name on a sign that many guides will have, and they will direct you to your bus.

Upon arriving at the Punta Cana airport, each passenger is required to purchase a USD10 tourist card before entering immigration, often included in your documentation upon departure or issued on the flight (unless you have a Dominican passport, a cedula residence card or your foreign passport shows that you were born in the Dominican Republic).  After retrieving luggage and clearing customs, arriving passengers will be greeted by their tour company representative ",{"type":"'''","value":["to the right"]}," and directed to board the correct bus for transfer to their resort.

All taxis operate with standard rates; most drivers carry a copy of these.  The best thing to do when hiring a taxi is to clarify your destination and the price in advance.  You pay upon arrival at your destination. Most hotels have taxi stations on or near their property; in most cases a bellman or front desk clerk can order a taxi for you. Taxi drivers accept dollars, pesos, and euros.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Local Buses"]},": For the more adventurous, the local bus lines operate on most of the roads of the area, for a minimal cost.

These shops are owned and operated by the locals. Shopping outside of the resort complex in Punta Cana\/Bavaro can be kind of an adventure. In most shopping plazas, you can expect to be approached by one or more friendly, but insistent salespersons. The people of the Dominican Republic love to barter. You can expect that once in one of their stores you will be taken for a ride. You will initially be quoted  ridiculously outrageous prices. It is imperative that you get the item as cheaply as you can. This can become quite an ordeal as the shopkeeper fights with you, insults you for your frugality, etc.\n\nWhen walking along the beach vendors will solicit your business. It can be annoying as they will keep pestering you until you come and look at what they have to offer. Tell them that you are not interested and keep walking. The best way of letting the locals know that you are not interested is to tell them that you have no money. The people of the Dominican Republic are very friendly and are offended when you walk past them with no acknowledgement of their presence. A simple \"no, thank you\" may sometimes work, but in most cases, they will not take no for an answer and will continue to chase and harass you.\n\nDo not buy dried animals (turtle shells, sea shells, etc.) because a) It is illegal, so you will not be allowed to bring them through customs, and may get arrested trying; and b) it encourages the locals to kill these creatures.
