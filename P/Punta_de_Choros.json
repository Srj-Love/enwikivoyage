During the summer it receives a lot of Chilean and foreign tourists looking to enjoy the beach and nearby nature reserve, but during the winter it is relatively empty.\n\nThe major draw is the National Humboldt Penguin Reserve, where it is possible to see Humboldt penguins, bottlenose dolphins, sea lions, sea otters, and many types of seabirds. Sea lions are visible all year round. Dolphin sightings are frequent but not guaranteed. During the summer, the penguins are quite active hunting and swimming. During the winter, the penguins nest in the rocks high above so it is more difficult to see them from the boats.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nThe most convenient way to get to Punta de Choros is by car.
