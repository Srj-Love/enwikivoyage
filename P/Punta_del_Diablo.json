Although the peak season is defined by a primarily regional crowd, Punta del Diablo has established the Uruguayan coast as a destination for a growing number of foreign travelers throughout the year.\n\nPunta del Diablo has a bohemian feel, you'll see more white people with dreadlocks per capita here than anywhere else in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South America"]]},". One person described it as something you'd expect to find in a 1970's Lonely Planet book.\n\nThe essence of the charming ",{"type":"''","value":["balneario"]},", known for its eclectic architecture and traditional artisan fishing industry, differs greatly from summer to winter.  While the two seasons are very distinct they both have a lot of appeal. The summer consists of sunbathing on one of the several gorgeous beaches and partying the night away at the townâ€™s popular night clubs among throngs of eager vacationers trying to make the most of their summer holidays.  Winter, on the other hand, is much quieter.  Travelers enjoy deliciously deserted beaches, unbeatable surfing conditions and fireside chats. Without the crowds, slow season in Punta del Diablo is all about getting away from the hustle and bustle of the city and finding your own idyllic coastal escape.\n\nAmid the notable development which houses summer crowds the town itself maintains its rustic charm, with only a handful of colorful shops, a seasonal outcropping of bohemian cafes, a school and a beach full of fishing boats.\n \n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nPunta del Diablo is served by regular bus service to Chuy (the border with brazil), Rocha (departmental capital), and Montevideo. During the summer there is also seasonal service along the coast to La Paloma, La Pedrera and Punta del Este. \n\nThere are some buses which don't actually stop in Punta del Diablo, but just at the turn off at the highway. It's a 5km walk or an easy hitch hike into town. \n\nDuring the high season of tourism, January, all bus seats are sometimes booked days in advance.\n\nAnother suggestion is to rent a car from Montevideo and drive through the wonderful coastal towns and rural landscape. If you are 4 travelers or more consider this as it will give you flexibility and not confine you to a rather sparse bus schedule. Car rental cost versus buses tickets are actually not that far off if you plan ahead. Should you rent a car in Montevideo do not rent from agencies directly in the port terminal arrival area but call other locations: you will be surprised that the price will be at least half that of the terminal agencies even if they are the same company.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nIt is possible walk from one end of town to the other in about an hour. For people staying at \"el camping\" on the main road in to town there is a regular bus service which brings people from there to the playa de pescadores (fisherhman's beach). Many locals have motos, 4 wheelers, or horses to get around. You do not need a vehicle to get around. There is a taxi which often is parked near the bus stop to carry your luggage to the house you've rented.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Live Music"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Live music is a staple of the summer scene in Punta del Diablo.

As night there is a small club scene.\n\nTo the north it's possible to walk along the beach to the biological reserve Santa Teresa and then from there to the Fort of Santa Teresa an historic fort.
