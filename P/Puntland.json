Although much safer than Southern or Central Somalia, the region of Puntland remains home to several warlords and the possibility of being killed, kidnapped or otherwise harmed remains high. Violent crime, petty theft and a lack of basic services are also significant dangers. Puntland and Somaliland territorial claims overlap and the border region between them is a conflict zone and is to be avoided. Overland travel from Somaliland is either not possible or incredibly dangerous. Persons travelling to Puntland with aid organizations, et cetera should consult the security measures your organization\/employer has in place.

Its leaders declared the territory an autonomous state in 1998.\nPuntland is bordered by the Somaliland region to its west, the Gulf of Aden in the north, the Indian Ocean in the southeast, the central Galmudug region in the south, and Ethiopia in the southwest.\nA third of Somalia's population lives in the territory, which contains about a third of the nation's geographical area. Unlike neighbouring Somaliland, Puntland, as with all other regions in the country, does not seek outright independence from Somalia.\nThe name \"Puntland\" is derived from the Land of Punt mentioned by ancient Egyptian sources. The exact location of the fabled territory is still a mystery. Many studies suggest that the Land of Punt was located in present-day Somalia, while others propose that it was situated elsewhere.\n\nPuntland is relatively peaceful compared to other regions of Somalia, with its own government and public services; however, it's best to hire a local police unit for the day.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nThe flight from Dubai on Jubba Airways takes 2-3 hours.
