A round-trip train ticket costs 72 Rubles, and trains run at 15-20 minute intervals starting at 6:00am until midnight except:\n\n- Leaving St. Petersburg, there is no train service between 10:00am and 12:00 noon on weekdays.  The trains during that interval only operate on weekends and holidays; trains outside that interval run 7 days per week.  Note that ALL LOCAL TRAINS leaving the Vitebskiy Station stop at Detskoe Selo and Pavlovsk; this makes it a bit easier for non-Russian speakers, since you don't have to worry about which train to board even though different trains go to different terminus stations.\n\n- Returning from Pushkin toward St. Petersburg, there is a gap in service between 12:30pm and 2:30pm weekdays, although trains do operate during that interval on weekends and holidays.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Bernsteinzimmer01.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Corner of the Amber Room inside Catherine's Palace"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Catherine Palace"]},". Entry fee is 100-320 Rubles. If you are not with a tour group, the palace is only open to individuals during limited hours: 12:00 to 2:00pm and 4:00pm to 5:00pm.  However, if there is a dearth of tour groups during the appointed hours for groups (i.e. 10:00am - noon and 2:00pm to 4:00pm), the palace does allow individuals enter during those times.  This is more likely to happen in the off-season, such as deep winter, and not at all likely in the summer. The sight is really breathtaking,expecially during the winter,with the snow covering the magnificent park. The palace has been built by Italian architect Bartolomeo Rastrelli,famous for having also designed the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg,on behalf of the Emperess Catherine The Great. It hosts huge rooms totally gilded in gold and incredible paintings. The main sight is the \"Amber Room\", a copy made in amber of the original,lost during the Second World War. A gift of the German Kaiser to the Emperess,has its walls and furniture totally carved in baltic amber pieces. Despite the original having been lost,this copy is made with the same materials. The park offers stunning landscapes,with a wood and a small lake,covered by ice during the winter. Nearby lies the \"Petite Hermitage\", a secluded house used by the Emperess to attend private meetings. Under the main room lies the kitchen,where the servants used to lift the dishes with an elevator to the private rooms, without disturbing the Emperess"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Alexander Palace"]},".
