[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Mena-asia_default_banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Puthia"]}," (pronounced ",{"type":"''","value":["pou-tee-ah"]},") is a village and complex of ancient temples and palaces in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rajshahi Division"]]}," of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bangladesh"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThe Puthia Raj family, of which the town is named, eventually came to own the area some time in the 16th century. The head of the family, Bhatsacharya, was given the title of a zamindar (wealthy Hindu land-owner) by the Emperor. Their family built a number of temples and palaces on the site, surrounding the lake with a sprawling lawn. The Puthia estate flourished, and it went on to become the second-largest and wealthiest zamindary in all the Indian subcontinent. After the partition of India, the new Pakistan government revoked all zamindars of their titles and land, and the family fled to India soon after.\n\nToday, the site has been fairly well-preserved. There are a number of Hindu temples in the area, as well as the imposing ",{"type":"'''","value":["Puthia Palace"]},".

The village itself is about 1km south of the major highway. A number of buses ply the 30 minute route between the two towns for Tk 20; it is possible to simply ask to get off at Puthia, and walk the short distance into town. Another option is to catch a CNG auto-rickshaw to Puthia from one of the major towns.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nPuthia is a small place, so walking is a simple and enjoyable way of getting around. Otherwise, hail a passing rickshaw who will happily take you to the sites. It's possible to hire out the driver for a number of hours or even the entire day; if you're lucky, he might speak English and give you a nice little tour of the area, historical information included!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nThere are no opportunities for Puthia-themed souvenirs.
