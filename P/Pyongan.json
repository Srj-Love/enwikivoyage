If you're coming by train from China, Sinuiju is likely the first city you'll see. It is possible to get to around one hundred metres near to Sinuiju by boat from Dandong.

In wintertime, the river freezes over and locals on both sides trek across the border to trade (or defect). However, the North Korean army regularly patrols the border, and any foreigners caught on the wrong side can expect to be detained and accused of spying.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["North_Korea"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Pyongan"]]}]
