There are both road and foot paths to the top. See the view from the monastery. It is quite spectacular. The monastery itself is usually closed, but on rare occasions, you can visit. If on foot, you can take a path down the other side of the mountain to Kamari or Perissa, and see Ancient Thira along the way. Note that the path is not marked -- heading up, it comes off of the left side of the road, very close to the top.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Selene Restaurant"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+30 22860 22249"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=The \"Selene\" restaurant, established in 1986, offers Greek and Santorini cuisine in accordance with the current gastronomical trends, based on experimentation and the use of local products.
