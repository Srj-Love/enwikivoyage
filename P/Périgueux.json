However, there are no direct train connections with Paris. Therefore, a trip to or from the French capital requires a connection in Limoges. From Paris to Limoges, several direct Intercity trains leave from Paris-Austerlitz station each day. In Limoges, hourly- to two-hourly services are available to Perigueux. The total trip takes around 4 or 5 hours. \n\nCar travel is logical as well, especially if you want to tour the surrounding area at your leisure.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nMost sights are reachable by foot: main attractions like the Vesunna Museum, Renaissance area, Roman arena, art museum and the Odyssey Theatre are all within a five minute walk from each other.\n\nThere is a bus system that runs through the town and to the outlying areas as well, with stops scattered pretty evenly throughout the town. \n\nBicycles and motor scooters can be rented from several shops, including MBK near the Office of Tourism. Prices are very reasonable, with bikes running from 10€ and scooters from 20-30€ per day. \n\nThere aren't many taxis floating around town to flag. Cabs generally must be called for in advance.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Périgueux 24 Fontaine place Plumancy 2014.jpg"],["thumb"],["Place Plumancy"]]},"\nThere are many caves in the area. Midway between Limoges and Périgueux is Thiviers, a small market town thirty minutes train journey north of Périgueux and claimed to be the Capital of Foie gras and Truffles. It is also the town in which French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre spent his childhood years. The building is now used by a property agent but the square behind has been named after him. The office of tourism in Thiviers has now incorporated a museum de Foie gras in its premises displaying many items showing how Foie gras is made, entrance is free.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Swim"]}," in the recently-built ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.agglo-perigueux.fr\/site\/infos.asp?rubrique=139 swimming pool"]}]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" Go see a ",{"type":"'''","value":["movie"]}," in the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cap-cine.fr\/perigueux\/horaires\/ cinema"]}]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nThere is a market with fresh local produce going on Wednesday and Saturday mornings\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Bien Bon"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["drink"],["name=Toqués de la bière"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Many beers to discover, good humor and concerts galore!"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["drink"],["name=Marco Polo sur son vélo"],["url=http:\/\/www.marcopolosursonvelo.com\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Is a tea bar which also has a nice atmosphere but is more quiet"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Dordogne"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Périgueux"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["45.183333333333"],["0.71666666666667"]]}]
