To my knowledge NONE of the hypermarkets in Pezenas sell road fuel. There are several petrol stations in the town, but these are expensive when compared with hypermarkets. Best to visit hypermarkets in Beziers about 20km south, or Clermont Herault 15km North, for cheap fuel.\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["43.4667"],["3.4167"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Hérault"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Pézenas"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Pézenas"]]}]
