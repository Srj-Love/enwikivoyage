It has always been an area important for fishing, hunting and reindeer husbandry for the locals.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nPeople seem to have come to hunt reindeer near lake Pöyrisjärvi since the stone age. Hunting and fishing have been important also in later times, but hunting became less important since the wild reindeer and the beaver got extinct in the 19th century. Reindeer herding probably came to Finland in the 17th century. Until 1852 the herders at Pöyrisjärvi were from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kautokeino"]]}," in Norway, but then the border was closed and two local herding groups were formed, with summer villages at Pöyrisjärvi and Kalkujärvi. These villages are still inhabited part of the year.\n\nThere are ",{"type":"'''","value":["prehistoric trapping pits"]}," in many locations, marked on the map as ",{"type":"''","value":["pyyntikuoppia"]},". They are much shallower than when they were used; use the map and your imagination to reconstruct the hunt.\n\nThe wilderness areas were established 1991 to protect the wilderness character of these areas, secure the Sami culture and develop usage of the nature, including reindeer herding, fishing and hunting. There are severe restrictions on building any infrastructure, but the status has little influence on what a hiker is allowed to do. Most of the area is owned by the government and administered by ",{"type":"''","value":["Metsähallitus"]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\nThe area consists of rolling fell and forest landscape, with many fells reaching above the tree line (little above 400 meters). There are also large bogs, including ",{"type":"[[","value":[["w:palsa"],["palsa"]]}," bogs. There are impressing sand dunes and ridges, especially north of lake Pöyrisjärvi. A treeless fell plateau starts north of the lake (north of the Norwegian border, in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Finnmark"]]},", it continues as part of the vast Finnmarksvidda).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\nMost of the area is dominated by fell birch forest, bogs and small lakes. In the south there are also pine forests. Diverse fell vegetation is found on many fell tops and in the far north.\n\nThe area is rich in wading bird (21 species) and water fowl (17 species, including long-tailed duck, common scoter, smew and whooper swan). On the fell tops there are snow buntings, ptarmigans, Eurasian dotterels, rough-legged buzzards and (some years) snowy owls. Most birds are migratory and not seen in the winter.\n\nArctic fox, wolverine, lynx, wolf and brown bear all occur in the area, while least weasel, ermine and mink are common.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nThe wilderness area is in inland Lapland, near the tree line. This means advice for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["cold weather"]]}," apply in full in the winter. In midwinter temperatures down to -40°C (-40°F) are not exceptional. Spring comes late and winter early. Freezing temperatures and snow are possible also in the summer, although day temperatures of 15–20°C (55–70°F) and night temperatures of 5–10°C  (40–50°F) are the norm.

Hetta is the main village of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Enontekiö"]]},", with quite good connections and an assortment of shops.\n\nAll common entrances can easily be reached by car or taxi from Hetta, and there are coach connections to less than one day's walk from them. If you use coaches, some careful planning is needed, as only Hetta has daily connections.\n\nFrom the nature centre there is a trail all the way to lake Pöyrisjärvi (45 km), marked half the way, to the Sami winter village ",{"type":"'''","value":["Näkkälä"]}," (Neahčil).

There is an open wilderness hut at Kalmakaltio. You can also use the bridge at the end of the road (take the left road at the fork some 2.5 km before the wilderness hut).

Fishing in still waters with a rod and a line (with no reel nor artificial lure other than a jig) is free. For lure fishing or fishing in the streams you need permits, both a general fee (€22 for a year, €7 for a week) and either a lure fishing permit for all Finnish Lapland, but not streams (€29 for a year, €7 for a week), or a permit for the streams of Enontekiö. Children and elderly are exempted from some of the fees. Check current regulations. There are minimum allowed sizes for different fish species.\n\nAlso hunting permits can be bought from the nature centre. Pöyrisjärvi is divided into an eastern and a western area (the dividing line at Vuontisjärvi, some areas excluded). Permits can be bought for 1–7 days or for a hunting season. There are three kinds: \"willow ptarmigan permit\" (€17\/day) covering also hare, red fox, legal waterfowl, small predators etcetera, \"water fowl permit\" (not recommended) and \"small predator permit\" (day permits not available). The permit allows a number of points, with different game \"costing\" different numbers of these points. The hunting season starts 1th August, but the legal period varies by game.

The roads in the area are not usable with normal cars and extend only to some parts of it.\n\nA good map, a compass and the skill to use them are needed. Not all paths are marked on the maps.
