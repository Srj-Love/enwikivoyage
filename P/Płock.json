The timetables and route maps can be found on the kmplock website ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.kmplock.eu\/www\/"]}," (in Polish) or at the bus stops. Most of the buses seem to run a few times an hour and from experience they are very rarely late (unlike England), in fact if anything arrive at the bus stop 5-10 minutes before scheduled departure time as they do sometimes arrive a little early and tend not to wait. There are very modern buses on some lines while some have older ones but all are of decent standard. The buses do tend to get busy most days so be prepared to stand (remember that in Poland it is considered polite to offer your seat to elders).\n\nYou need to buy the ticket before boarding and they are around 3-4 zł for an adult ticket with concession prices available. They are available at nearly every food shop and easy to get, you need to scan them in the machine once you get on the bus.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Vistula River"]},", particularly attractive at sunset."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cathedral"]},", early romanic then modified in the centuries, on the hill neighboring the Vistula, in town center."]},{"type":"*","value":[" The remnants of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cazimir's Castle"]},", facing the Cathedral."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Masovian Museum"]},", in Ul.
