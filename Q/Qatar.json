While the museum houses a variety of artifacts including spearheads and pieces of pottery, there is little left of the structures that may have once existed. The Al-Jassassiya rock carvings north of Doha give some idea of how these tribes may have lived. More recently, some sandstone buildings and mosques were discovered, piquing the interest of archaeologists as they seek to discover what still lays beneath the sand.\n\nEmerging out of ancient history, Qatar was dominated by various Western and Eastern empires. The Holy Jihad used the peninsula as a trading post and military port, until the Portuguese were able to extend their rule over the region. Neighbouring ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bahrain"]]}," eventually annexed the peninsula, until rebel movements and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Britain"],["British"]]}," intervention again made Qatar independent. Under pressure, Qatar became a part of the Ottoman Empire in 1871 before becoming a British protectorate at the close of World War I. After a brief stint as part of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United Arab Emirates"]]},", independence was declared from Britain peacefully in 1971.\n\nSince these times, Qatar has transformed itself from a poor British protectorate noted mainly for its pearling industry into an independent state with significant oil and natural gas revenues, which enable Qatar to have the highest GDP per capita in the world. Qatar has become deeply involved in world affairs under the royal family, offering support in peacekeeping missions and UN-mandated wars such as that in the Gulf in 1991. Qatar also plays host to various world conferences, including those of the World Trade Organisation, the UN Climate Convention and various mediation bodies. It leaped onto the world stage with the development of the popular Al Jazeera news network and expansion of Qatar Airways to most of the world's continents, and is rapidly gaining interest among foreigners as it prepares to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup after already holding the Asian Games in 2006.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Economy"]},"\nOil is a cornerstone of the Qatari economy; it used to account for more than 30% of GDP, roughly 80% of export earnings and 58% of government revenues. Proven oil reserves of 15 billion barrels should ensure continued output at current levels for at least the next 20 years. Oil and gas have given Qatar the highest GDP per capita by most studies. Qatar's proved reserves of natural gas exceed 7 trillion cubic metres, more than 11% of the world's total, making it the third largest reserve in the world. Production and export of natural gas are becoming increasingly important. Qatar manages to post very high surpluses each year, and escaped the Global Financial Crisis relatively unscathed.\n\nIn addition to the energy sector, Qatar also exports petrochemicals, cement and steel. Doha has a rapidly growing financial sector that is cementing itself as one of the centres of trade and finance within the Middle East. The Qatari government has also outlined its plan to boost tourism and media businesses on the peninsula, creating new sectors to further increase Qatar's profile. In addition, many foreign universities have set up outposts in Qatar, transforming Qatar into one of the main education hubs of the Middle East.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh=21.9"],["febhigh=23.6"],["marhigh=27.6"],["aprhigh=32.6"],["mayhigh=38.5"],["junhigh=41.0"],["julhigh=41.9"],["aughigh=41.3"],["sephigh=39.3"],["octhigh=35.4"],["novhigh=29.5"],["dechigh=24.0"],["janlow=12.1"],["feblow=13.4"],["marlow=16.7"],["aprlow=20.8"],["maylow=25.3"],["junlow=27.7"],["jullow=29.4"],["auglow=29.0"],["seplow=26.4"],["octlow=22.7"],["novlow=18.4"],["declow=13.9"],["janprecip =12.7"],["febprecip =17.8"],["marprecip =15.2"],["aprprecip =7.6"],["mayprecip =2.5"],["junprecip =0"],["julprecip =0"],["augprecip =0"],["sepprecip =0"],["octprecip =0"],["novprecip =2.5"],["decprecip =12.7"]]},"\n\nThe climate of Qatar can be described as arid and unforgiving.

The location of so many academics and students is very appealing for research focused organisations. \n\nThe College of the North Atlantic (based in Newfoundland, Canada), also maintains a campus in Doha in the northern section of the city, near the local Qatar University. The University of Calgary (Nursing) is also in Qatar.\n\nAnd on the second semester of the 2012-2013 the Supreme Council Of Education will start E-learning\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Work"]},"\n\nThe work day starts quite early in Qatar.

However, this is more of an annoyance than a threat, and Qatar officials deal harshly with any complaint of harassment. If you want to fit in better with the locals and attract less stares, a long, black cloak and headscarf worn by local women called the ",{"type":"''","value":["abaya"]}," can be purchased at a variety of places in Doha.\n\nTravelling on the roads is probably the largest danger to your wellbeing. Although being safer than most other Asian and Middle Eastern drivers, Qataris often ignore road rules and are intolerant of pedestrians attempting to cross the road. Be safe when walking near or over major highways.\n\nDust storms and sandstorms are another major issue, being common throughout the dry summer. These natural events can shroud the country in darkness and cause severe respiratory issues. If a sandstorm is approaching, immediately seek shelter or wear a facemask.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\nDrink lots of bottled water!

It is absolutely acceptable for any nationality to wear the traditional Qatari clothes, the thobe.\n\nIf you're dining with a Qatari, don't expose the bottoms of your feet to him\/her. Don't eat with your left hand either, since the left hand is seen as the 'dirty hand'. Similarly, don't attempt to shake hands or hand a package with your left hand.\n\nIf your Qatari friend insists on buying you something—a meal or a gift—let him! Qataris are extremely hospitable, and typically there are no strings attached. It is generally a custom to argue for the bill.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Newspapers"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.gulf-times.com\/ Gulf Times"]}," newspaper"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.thepeninsulaqatar.com\/ The Peninsula"]}," newspaper"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/iloveqatar.net\/forum\/list.php?28 I Love Qatar"]}," Community News"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.al-watan.com\/ Al Watan"]}," Arabic newspaper"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.qatar-tribune.com\/ Qatar Tribune"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" Marhaba Magazine"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By phone"]},"\nWhen calling from abroad, the country code of Qatar is ",{"type":"'''","value":["974"]},".
