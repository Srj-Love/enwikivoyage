The mountain complex is home to both many Taoist and Buddhist temples and sites along the paths that wind up to its peaks. The area is snow-free all year round and is known for its peaceful quiet (this of course excludes the Chinese tourists that flock there on major holidays and the incessantly loud blasts of bus horns along major roadsides). The back entrance to the mountain is much less touristy and much more quiet and should be visited first by those who have hiking as their priority. It contains many links to over 80km worth of very green and lush hiking paths including a few small chairlifts.\n\nThe Dujiangyan Irrigation system is a marvel of Chinese imagination. Before the completion of Dujiangyan, the plains around the Min River were prone to flash flooding. This was due to the fast moving river flowing down from the mountains and meeting level ground. It was in the Warring States period about 2,200 years ago, that the engineer Li Bing and his son led the construction of the Dujiangyan irrigation system. This allowed the taming of the river and the irrigation of the surrounding lands.\n\nFor more information see:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"''","value":["Qingcheng\/Dujiangyan (China)"]}," (2000), UNESCO World Heritage.

The bus drops you off at the front gate, which is not actually the start of the trails. A new express train service now runs from Chengdu's North Train Station, taking about 45 minutes. It is best to buy tickets the day before you depart, as they often sell out ahead of time, even on weekdays.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\nThe entrance fee is ¥90 (2011) but if you get the Panda Card (shengmao card) in Chengdu, which is designed to restore tourism after the earthquake, you can get in for free (until December 31 2009).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nYou can either climb to the top which takes around 3 hours or take a boat across the lake (¥5) to a ropeway (¥35 one way ¥60 round trip) which will get you there sooner depending on the queue time (which during a holiday could approach and 1½ hours or more).  A sedan chair can also be hired for ¥100 or more in which two men carry you up the mountain.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nQingcheng Mountain is known for its Daoist temples.\n\nIf you are looking for more natural beauty then Qingcheng Hou Mountain is where you should head.

If you are expecting a spiritual experience DO NOT come on a Chinese holiday or the only quiet time you will have to enjoy it will be if you are lucky enough to find a bed in the monastery and wake up at sunrise before the tours get there.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nYou can stay at many of the monasteries on the mountain.  Some of them have recently been upgraded to 3 star status and accomodations can be in bunk style for around ¥40 to twin private rooms at ¥180.

The Chengdu bus is usually closest to the top of the parking lot though and does not leave until it is full.  Cost back is ¥20 and may not bring you to the bus station you want to be at in Chengdu.\n\nAnother alternative is to take the brand new high speed rail link back to Chengdu. It is much faster and convenient than the bus which cuts your travel time in half and delivers you in first class conditions to the North Train Station. A bargain price of only 15\/20 Yuan.  A taxi to the train station from the Qingchengshan parking lot will cost around 20 Yuan.\n\nYou may want to visit Dujiangyan Irrigation System after a trek up the mountain, which is the last stop for bus number 101 and leaves from the Qingchengshan parking lot.  It costs two and a half Yuan and is just a forty-five minute bus ride away.  The high speed train bound for Chengdu also leaves from Dujiangyan.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["East Sichuan"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinepark"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["no Wikipedia link"]]}]
