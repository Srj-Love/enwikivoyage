Take note of the timetable.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nThere are multiple train options when traveling to and from Qinhuangdao.  Most visitors to Qinhuangdao are coming from either Beijing or Tianjin.  Both cites are a short two hour ride on one of CRC's (China Railway Corp.) 'D' or 'Dong' trains.  A ticket for a fast train to or from Beijing is ¥93, but expect to pay a ¥5 ticketing fee if not purchased directly at a train station.  'T', 'K', and 'numbered' trains also make daily journeys through Qinhuangdao, but they are much slower (4-6 hours to\/from Beijing) and rarely worth the savings for western travelers who value time over cost.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nLong distance buses are common in China, and Qinhuangdao is no exception. Buses depart from a central station near to the central train station in the Haiguan area of the city. Bus tickets to and from Beijing will often cost as much as train tickets, but the departures are more frequent.  There is a direct bus from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beijing Capital International Airport"]]}," direct to Qinhuangdao. Travel time is roughly 4 hours (depending on traffic), and tickets can be purchased directly at the bus station at the airport for ¥150.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nQinhuangdao is a relatively small city by China standards.  However, due to its location on the water, the city tends to sprawl in a linear fashion along the coast from Shanhaiguan to Beidaihe, thus making buses and taxis necessary means for getting around.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nTaxis are inexpensive and abundant, thus making them the preferred means of transport for travelers.  Be sure you can confidently communicate where you want to go before you get into a cab as most of the drivers in Qinhuangdao can not speak English, but many of them can  read Chinese.  You can ask somebody to write down the place where you want go in Chinese on a card, and show this card to taxi driver. The best approach is to have a valid phone number for where you are going, or a phone number for a contact who can communicate with the driver in Chinese, should there be a problem.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nBuses are also a good option for getting around the city.  City maps, which contain bus routes on them, can be obtained from kiosks near to the central bus and train stations.  Buses cost between 1 and 2 yuan for a single ticket ride.  However, the low cost means that buses are always overcrowded, and occasional ",{"type":"[[","value":[["pickpockets"]]}," make it essential to protect your personal belongings.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nQinhuangdao has little in the way of things to see and places to visit.  Most visitors who come tend to spend their time at the beaches, which are very nice for Chinese standards.  Sights and tourist attractions are best discovered by purchasing one of the city maps from a kiosk near to the central bus station or central train station and looking at the pictures that surround the map as advertisement.  The best advice however, is to save your sightseeing for other cities you will visit, and simply spend your time at the beach while in Qinhuangdao.\n\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Emerald Isle"],["alt=翡翠岛"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Gold Coast is located in the southern coastal areas, is China's seven national marine nature reserve of.

The downtown area is comprised of many shops all selling different goods at prices that are usually less than in Beijing.  The styles however, tend to be out dated and nearly everything available is knock off versions of the 'real' products sold elsewhere in China.  There is a great DVD store on the second floor of the 'Blog Theme Hotel' near to 'Qinhuangdao Number 2 Middle School'.  There are also large electronic stores in the same vicinity.
