Then take the 195 bound for Alat and get off in the town of Qobustan, 0.80 AZN. The museum is a 6km+ walk in the opposite direction of the sea towards the hill with many rocks on, with no shade, and partially up a hill, so even the most taxi-allergic should consider this option, be sure to haggle for your fare though. The Roman graffiti is on a rock in the middle of a road that branches off from the road at the base of the hill with the museum on it. The area around the museum is good for hiking, there are many dormant or extinct mud volcanoes that have been heavily eroded, making for spectacular scenery. The cost for the museum is: adults 2 AZN; children 0.20 AZN, parking 1 AZN.  Plus, if you want, 6 AZN for an English-speaking guide.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nQobustan is best known for its rock petroglyphs (a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["UNESCO World Heritage List"],["UNESCO World Heritage site"]]},") and mud volcanoes.\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["James Bond oil field"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bibi Heyb…ôt Mosque"]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Baku Region"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Qobustan, Baku"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["40.084166666667"],["49.415833333333"]]}]
