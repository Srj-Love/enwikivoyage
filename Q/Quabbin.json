Thirsty Bostonians looked eastward to the Swift River and the topographic design of the Pioneer valley and figured it would be a perfect fit for a reservoir. Through a series of buyouts the four towns that inhabited this area were bought and the inhabitants were forced to move.  The entire landscape was torn up and recreated. Houses had to be torn down, factories demolished, millions of acres of trees were cut, and even bodies from cemeteries had to be dug up (except for some Native Americans) and moved to a new location in the near by town of Ware, MA. \nThe actual flooding of the valley occurred in August of 1939 and in 1946 the reservoir was filled to capacity. To this day it is one beautiful sight in any season. During the Summer the water glistens, Fall brings the marvelous New England colorful foliage, and Winter in its silent white beauty descends on the area. \nThis reservoir in the middle of Massachusetts, allows biking along its paths, hiking its countless trails, and even in the Northern section fishing is allowed in the summer. This is certainly a place for hikers, bikers and other weekend explorers. If one looks carefully, in the woods, there are countless cellar holes, stone walls, and abandoned roads reminiscent of a time past. While fishing, if one happens to look down into the water, on a sunny day, the remnants of old buildings and foundations can be seen at the bottom. This sort of eerie adventure brings many to this location during all seasons.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Hiking"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Gate 36"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content= Petersham, MA (",{"type":"''","value":["State Forest Rd"]},")After parking at the T intersection, walk east to the shore of Quabbin Reservoir.

The trail to the left takes a slightly longer route to the shore and then continues north along it, eventually connecting with a road from Gates 26 and 27.
