Staff at retail shops, restaurants and tourist attractions will often speak English, especially in Montréal. Smaller establishments, especially outside Montréal, may not offer services in English but try their best to accommodate travellers. About 8% of the province's residents speak English as a mother tongue, and an additional 31% consider that they can get by speaking it. All offices of the federal government are required by law to provide services in both French and English.\n\nThe official language of Québec, however, is ",{"type":"'''","value":["French"]},". Provincial government signs (highway signs, government buildings, hospitals, etc.) are generally posted in French only. Services at provincial government offices are also often available in French only. Tourist information is offered in English and other languages. The visibility of commercial signs and billboards in English and other languages is restricted by law (except for English-language media and cultural venues such as theatres, cinemas and bookstores). Most businesses will not have signs in English except in tourist areas and localities with a large English-speaking population. Language is a very sensitive subject politically, particularly in Montréal. If you cannot read a sign in a store or restaurant, most sales people will be sympathetic and help you find your way. Most restaurants in tourist areas will supply English menus if asked.  \n\n82% of Québec’s population is francophone, but English is also commonly spoken, particularly in the province’s major cities such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Montréal"]]}," where the percentage is 24%. For French-speaking people from elsewhere, the French spoken in Québec is often difficult to understand. Books have been published on Québec expressions, and these may be worth consulting if you are planning to stay in Québec for any length of time. \n\nIsolated from France for centuries, and unaffected by that country's 19th-century language standardization, Québec has developed its own \"accent\" of French similar to the one in France in the 16th century, a kind of time capsule. The continental variety—called \"international French\" or ",{"type":"''","value":["français international"]}," here—is well-understood, and something closely approximating it is spoken by broadcasters and many businesspeople. While Quebecers usually understand European French, European tourists may feel lost until they grow accustomed to the local accent(s). \n\nThere are a few main differences between Québécois French and continental French-from-France. One is that in Quebec it's relatively common to ",{"type":"''","value":["tutoyer"]}," (use the familiar ",{"type":"''","value":["tu"]}," second-person pronoun instead of ",{"type":"''","value":["vous"]}," when saying ",{"type":"''","value":["you"]},") for all, regardless of age or status (though there are common exceptions to this in the workplace and the classroom). In France, it would be considered impolite. The unrelated interrogative particle ",{"type":"''","value":["-tu"]}," is used to form yes-or-no questions, as in ",{"type":"''","value":["On y va-tu?"]}," \"Shall we go?\" Finally, there are a number of vocabulary words that differ, particularly in very informal contexts (for example, ",{"type":"''","value":["un char"]}," for a car, rather than ",{"type":"''","value":["une voiture"]},"), and some common expressions (",{"type":"''","value":["C'est beau"]}," [literally ",{"type":"''","value":["It's nice"]},"] for \"OK\" or \"fine\"). Overall, however, pronunciation marks the most significant difference between Québec and European French. \n\nProbably the most puzzling difference in Québec's French is that one will often ",{"type":"'''''","value":["sacrer"]}," (blaspheme or swear) rather than using scatological or sexual curse words. Terms like ",{"type":"''","value":["baptême"]}," (baptism) or ",{"type":"''","value":["viarge"]}," (deformation of ",{"type":"''","value":["vierge"]},", virgin) have become slangy and taboo over the centuries in this once fervently Catholic culture. ",{"type":"''","value":["Hostie de tabarnac!"]}," (\"communion wafer of the tabernacle!\") or just ",{"type":"''","value":["tabarnak!"]}," is one of the most obscene things to say, and more polite versions like ",{"type":"''","value":["tabarnouche"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["tabarouette"]}," are equivalent to \"darn\" or \"fudge!\"  \n\nAlthough ",{"type":"''","value":["sacre"]}," may seem funny, be assured that Quebeckers, particularly the older generation, do take it seriously. Don't ",{"type":"''","value":["sacre"]}," any time you don't really mean it! But be sure that younger Quebeckers may be fond of teaching you a little ",{"type":"''","value":["sacrage"]}," lesson if you ask them.  \n\nEnglish-speaking Quebeckers are generally bilingual and reside mostly in the Montréal area, where 25% of the population speaks English at home. Aside from the occasional borrowing of local French terms (\"dépanneur\" as opposed to corner store or convenience store), their English differs little from standard Canadian English, including the occasional \"eh\" at the end of the sentence; accents are influenced heavily by ethnicity, with distinct Irish, Italian, Jewish, and Greek inflections heard in Montréal neighbourhoods. Conversations between anglophones and francophones often slip unconsciously between English and French as a mutual show of respect. This can be confusing if you're not bilingual, and a look of puzzlement will generally signal a switch back to a language everyone can understand.\n\nAlthough English-speakers will usually greet strangers in French, it is considered pretentious and overzealous for a native English-speaker to continue a conversation in French with other English speakers (though two francophones will easily converse together in English when in a room of anglophones). Local English-speakers may also refer to street names by their English names as oppose to the posted French names, but this is getting rarer (for example, Mountain Street for rue de la Montagne, Pine Avenue for avenue des Pins). \n\nSome French-language radio stations, including those with \"classic rock\" formats may play English language music.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Aéroport Montréal-Trudeau 2010.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["250px"],["Montreal's Trudeau International Airport"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nThere are flights to Québec from major cities in North America, Europe and Asia.
