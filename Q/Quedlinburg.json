Today it is one of Europe's best preserved medieval renaissance towns. It features a rare combination of ancient and modern historical treasures. In 1992 it was placed on the UNESCO World Heritage list. Almost all of the buildings in the town centre are timber framed, some dating back to the 16th Century. It is a sight not to be missed, walking through the narrow alleys and streets around the town square and seeing all the colourful painted old houses. In the innermost parts of the town a wide selection of timber framed buildings from at least five different centuries are to be found, including a 14th century structure, one of Germany's oldest. Fortunately Quedlinburg did not suffer too much damage during WW2 and preservation orders were put on a large number of these properties. If you wish to learn more about the timber framed buildings of the region, a trip to the Fachwerkmuseum Standebau in one of Germanys oldest half timbered houses (1310) is a must.\n\nA highlight of Quedlinburg is the castle (schlossberg) perched above the city, of which the centre piece is the recently restored baroque Blue Hall (blue Halle).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nThe nearest main airport is Hanover International Airport (HAJ) (57 km).

The place did not become known as the Hexentanzplatz until the cult was banned by the invading Christian Franks. According to tradition the site was guarded by Frankish soldiers in order to enforce the ban and they were chased off by Saxons dressed as witches and riding on broomsticks. On this plateau is the Thale Mountain Theatre (Bergtheater Thale), one of the oldest open-air theatres in Germany with 1,350 seats, which was founded in 1903 by Ernst Wachler. A gondola lift runs from Thale up to the Hexentanzplatz, where today, the plateau resembles a small Theme Park aimed at families. It includes  various rides, small gift and craft shops and a Wildlife Park, illustrating the wide variety of different species of animal who can be found in the Harz region.

The walk starts next to Thale gondola station, where the path follows the river, taking you through dense forest and then into open meadows filled with wildflowers, ending in the village of Treseburg near a ruined castle. The walk along the Bode Valley takes about three hours (covering about 10km), and is mostly gentle, with one short, somewhat steep climb that takes you to a great vantage point above the river. You can take the bus from Treseburg back to Thale.
