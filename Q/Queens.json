Except for the Whitestone and Throgs Neck bridges, all the bridges can be crossed by pedestrians and bicycles. Be prepared, however, for long walks, and don't forget that Queens is very, very big, and not well-designed for a walking tour. A map is necessary.\n\nSadly, most Queens visitors spend their visit on a bus to or from LaGuardia Airport or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["JFK Airport"]]},". A proper tour of Queens is worthwhile. It can be conducted by a stalwart driver; others may find the roads tough to navigate. However, a lot of Queens can be seen by subway. A trip on the 7 train, made nationally famous by the contempt of former Atlanta Braves pitcher John Rocker, is a cultural experience in and of itself. The 7 runs elevated through most of Queens, so you'll be able to get a good sense of much of the borough through its windows. A good tour of Queens should include at least three meals in three different ethnic enclaves.\n\nOther subways for getting around (and in and out of) Queens include the A, E, F, G, J, M, N, Q, R, and Z. The Long Island Rail Road makes several stops in Queens: the main line runs through central Queens and the Port Washington line runs along the north shore (including a stop in Flushing).\n\nExpress buses also stop in places in eastern Queens and the Rockaways, usually in places where the subway doesn't stop. Main arteries for express buses (that are closer to Manhattan) are Queens Boulevard and Woodhaven Boulevard.\n\nLocal buses that go into Midtown Manhattan include the Q32, Q60, and Q101. The M60 goes to upper Manhattan from LaGuardia Airport.\n\nThe Q48 is a great bus for going to eastern Queens from LaGuardia Airport. It leaves you at the Flushing-Main Street station. Other buses from LaGuardia Airport include the Q33 and Q47 to the Jackson Heights-Roosevelt Avenue subway station, the and the Q72 to the Rego Park and Junction Boulevard subway stations.\n\nThe Q10 and Q3 go from JFK Airport. The Q10 goes to Lefferts Boulevard and serves the A train, J\/Z trains, and E\/F train subway stations. The Q3 goes out towards eastern Queens and goes into Northern Jamaica to the 179th Street F station.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nQueens is quite diverse in density and character. While western Queens (closer to Manhattan) is urban, much of eastern Queens is relatively suburban. As in every borough, the closer you get to Manhattan, the more rare it is to find a stand-alone house. The more urban clusters are in the northwest: Astoria and Long Island City (LIC). LIC also contains Queens' most prominent skyscrapers, including the \"other\" Citibank building, located directly across the East River from the more prominent angled-roof skyscraper in Manhattan. Rising 50 stories, the building, the result of Citibank's attempt to create a new business district in LIC, is the tallest building in New York State located outside of Manhattan.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center"],["url=http:\/\/www.ps1.org"],["email="],["address=22-25 Jackson Avenue, Long Island City"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 718 784-2084"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Th-M noon-6pm"],["price="],["content=Supported by the Museum of Modern Art, this innovative (and cheap) contemporary art museum is in a former public school building.

Few taggers have defaced the site with their idiotic scrawls; rather, the art is better, fresher, and more colorful than many PS.1 exhibits. Be sure to walk around the entire length of the building. Just under the 7 train, which runs overhead on 5 Ptz's north face, you'll find a large enclosure for truck loading, which features some of the best artwork of all.
