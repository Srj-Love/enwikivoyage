It is a world famous destination attracting around 1.9 million visitors every year, undoubtedly the tourism capital of the South Island if not New Zealand, and a must-see stop for most visitors to New Zealand. \n\nSituated on the shores of Lake Wakatipu, one of Otago and New Zealand's most scenic lakes, surrounded by mountains, it's not hard to see why its stunning scenery draws people here year round. Queenstown happily caters for all visitors with a full range of attractions, activities, accommodation and eating options for any budget, from backpackers to five star luxury.  This popularity is not without its problems though - in many respects Queenstown can be a tourist trap. However, reasonable prices and a few bargains can be found for those prepared to look for them.\n\nQueenstown is a bustling town throughout the year, peaking over summer and during the ski-season. There is a vibrant night life with the town's small central area packed with bars and restaurants. If you plan on getting a good nights sleep, then you might consider staying slightly out of town. It's common to see people on the streets up to 05:00 returning from disco or pub. If you're looking for a relaxing scenic holiday, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wanaka"]]}," (just over an hours' drive away) is smaller and more tranquil with less of a manic teenage party atmosphere.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nQueenstown and the surrounding area was originally settled by Europeans and a substantial Chinese population for gold mining and farming in the 1860s. After the decline of gold mining, Queenstown became a sleepy rural town, popular as a summer getaway. \n\nIn 1947 New Zealand's first commercial ski field, Coronet Peak, opened. The skiing industry slowly expanded in the town driving its early growth as a tourist resort. Leveraging Queenstown's popularity as a ski destination, various other tourist industries grew up including the world's first permanent commercial bungee site, the Kawarau Bridge Bungy. Other attractions followed, along with a huge number of hotels to cater for the visitors. The last 10 years have seen the addition of international 5 star hotel chains such as the Hilton and Sofitel. Queenstown is still growing at a fantastic rate, with some of New Zealand's most expensive property prices (the median house price in December 2013 was $646,000, second only to Auckland) and new hotels still open regularly, although this has slowed somewhat recently. Time will tell if it can hold on to its character and protect its natural beauty from the effects of its own popularity.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Local newspapers"]},"\n",{"type":"''","value":["The Mirror"]},".

Low cloud and cold weather can close the runway, especially in winter, resulting in cancelled flights; however new precision approach equipment has considerably reduced this. \n\nQueenstown airport also provides for private jets and other aircraft, and there is a huge number of helicopter take-offs and landings each day.
