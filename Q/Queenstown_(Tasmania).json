[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Australia-oceania default banner.jpg"],["pgname=Queenstown"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Queenstown"]}," is an old mining town in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["West Coast Tasmania"],["Western Tasmania"]]},", that has been recognised by the National Trust as a historic town. It is about a 5 hour drive from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hobart"]]}," on the Lyell Highway. \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Orr Street, Queenstown.jpg"],["thumb"],["350px"],["Orr Street, Queenstown"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nMining began here in the late 1800s, first with gold and later copper. It remains an important industry and the main employer. In 2005-06, Copper Mines of Tasmania produced 2.6 million tonnes of copper concentrate. Tourism is a growing industry, \n\nQueenstown is the base of the West Coast Wilderness Railway (an Abt - rack railway), which runs to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Strahan"]]}," and draws large numbers of tourists. The original railway, used to transport ore from the mines to the port at Regatta Point\/Strahan, closed and was removed in the 1960s. It was restored and reopened in the early '90s.  Services are suspended in winter 2013 for repairs.\n\nQueenstown is an interesting town, nestled in the Queen River valley. Summers can be hot and can reach 30+ degrees, although it is not uncommon to have snow on Mt Owen in December. Winters are cool and wet, with snow falling regularly on the peaks on the West Coast Range that can be seen from the town. It is not uncommon for the roads into Queenstown to be blocked, and  for the town cut off for short periods during the middle of winter. The best time to visit is between December and April.\n\nMany of the early buildings remain and a stroll around town is a must if you want a sense of what the town was like during the height of the copper mining operations.\n\nThe drive in to Queenstown over Gormanston Hill is a startling introduction to the town. The barren landscape was brought about by the combination of tree removal for the smelters, and the subsequent years of pollution. Trees were logged to fuel the furnaces of the smelters in the early years. Then large amounts of sulphur from the smelting process polluted the soils, killing much of the ground vegetation. Heavy rainfall of the area washed away most of the topsoil. The combination of the effects of tree removal, heavy rains, smelter fumes and uncontrolled bushfires, are evident in the bare ground areas that are spread across the foothills of Mount Lyell and Mount Owen to this day.\n\nQueenstown is a great stopover when visiting the West Coast, with many West Coast attractions only a short drive away. Queenstown has a good range of places to sleep, as well as very picturesque drives to the nearby attractions.\n\nStrahan is  just over 40km, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zeehan"]]}," about 30 km, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cradle Mountain"]]}," and Lake St Clair just under 100 km. The ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park"]]}," is also nearby. The trout fishing at man-made ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lake Burbury"]]}," is world class.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nRegular bus services from either the north coast or Hobart\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nThe drive from Hobart takes 3.5 to 4 hours (depending upon conditions), taking you through towns such as New Norfolk, Hamilton, Ouse and Derwent Bridge before winding its way through the Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park, part of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area. \n\nLeaving the park, you come to the ghost towns of Linda and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gormanston"]]},", both of which were large communities during the early mining booms. Of particular interest are the ruins of the Royal Hotel at Linda.\n\nOnce past Gormanston the road becomes a narrow and winding affair, where all caution should be taken, but this is also where the spectacular views of the surrounding barren hills of Queenstown begin. Once over Gormanston hill there is a lookout on your left which takes in views of Queenstown and the Queen River Valley. It is well worth a stop for photos. Once past the lookout you drive past the black slag heap and into Queenstown.\n\nFrom Burnie it is a 2 hr drive along the A10, which takes you through the village of Tullah, where you first get to see Mt Murchison as it looms up ahead of you. Past Tullah you have a choice of routes. The A10 takes you on to Rosebery and over Mt Black or you can take the B28 around Lake Plimsoll, where there are spectacular views of Cradle Mountain National Park and the Franklin River World Heritage area. Both drives are on excellent road surfaces, although a little winding in places. The Lake Plimsoll road is about 15km shorter than the A10 into Queenstown.\n\nThe two routes above are only a guide (as well as the time it might take) and that a number of others can be taken from Launceston. Regardless of which route you take, and depending on what time of year that you travel, weather and road conditions should be taken into account.  Also if you are driving the roads for the first time, well worth avoiding night driving in winter. The roads around Queenstown can be covered in ice and snow during winter and right up to early December. Please drive carefully and obey speed limits and caution signs.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.westcoastwildernessrailway.com.au\/ West Coast Wilderness Railway"]}]}," operates as a tourist attraction between Queenstown and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Strahan"]]},", a distance of 34 km.
