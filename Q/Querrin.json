It has a little pier and a creek which fills at high tide protected by what is locally known as the island. The island is a bar of land extending West to East running parallel to the shore. It is actually connected to the land. \n\nThere is a handball alley which can be a centre of activity during the summer months as people play racquetball there now. At high tide you will often find teenagers and adults jumping off the pier. \n\nThere can be a strong current in the centre of the channel as the tide rises and falls so staying close to the pier and shore is best.\n\nSeol Sionna, a traditional boat building project is taking place in Querrin opposite Querrin National school. This is a project to build a 26 foot wooden sailing boat based on the \"Shannon Hooker\" that would have sailed these waters in the 18th  and 19th centuries.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nTurn left at Lisdeen church after 8km when coming from Kilrush in the direction of Kilkee.

It is a family run business and is a family friendly campsite. There is a choice of pre-erected bell tents or plenty of pitches for your own tents. There are some spots for camper vans in the car park, but limited facilities in terms of hook ups and chemical toilet disposal. Environmental principals are important in this campsite and there is a choice of compost toilets with covered outdoor showers or a standard toilet and shower block with rainwater harvesting and solar heating. Courses are run during the summer with focus on traditional craft and nature based activities. Santosa Yoga camp starts the summer with a 5 day family yoga event end of June. There is a yoga centre on site and yoga classes can be arranged on request.\nThis campsite would be ideal for groups, such as scouts or guides, cycling groups and walkers. There is a \"bender\" outdoor sauna which can be setup on request.\n\nFor children, there is a magical wonderland in the woodland with \"dens\" amongst the trees and a large ring fort\nin the centre of the woods. It may bring you back to your own childhood :)"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["County Clare"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["no Wikipedia link"]]}]
