Kan Mehtarzai (2,224 metres), the highest railway station in Asia, is a two-hour drive away. Loralai, the almond bowl of the country, is 265 km away.

They are known to be hospitable to visitors because hospitality is an important element of their cultures.\n\nNomadic tribesmen, mainly Balouchi, pass through Quetta Valley during spring and autumn with their herds of sheep and camels and their assorted wares for sale.
