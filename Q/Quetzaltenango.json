There are a number of attractions in town, and it's also a good base for exploring Guatemala's Western Highlands (\"Los Altos\"). Situated at the southwest of the country, the surrounding department has a variety of landscapes extending from the cold highlands to the warm Pacific coast. There are numerous volcanos, hot springs, valleys, mountains, rivers. The region provides a harvest of numerous products such as coffee, wheat, fruits and vegetables, as well as sheep and cattle breeding.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThe city of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Quetzaltenango"]},", the Department of the same name's capital and largest city, is situated on an extensive plain and surrounded by hills and volcanoes. The city of Quetzaltenango conserves the Maya-Quiche's old traditions and the colonial past, while maintaining the dynamism of modern life.\n\nThe city's roots go back to the Pre-Columbian Maya era. The Mam authority, called ",{"type":"''","value":["Kulahá"]},", reached its most important expansion. Later Quiches's Lords conquered the area, and founded the city of Xelajú here, moving it from a previous location at the base of the volcano Santa Maria.\n\nThe city was already some 300 years old when Spanish Conquistadors came to conquer Guatemala in the early 1500s.  Their native allies the Nahuas from Central Mexico called the city ",{"type":"'''","value":["Quetzaltenango"]},", meaning \"the place of the Quetzal bird\" in the Nahua language.  The Spanish took the name from the Nahuas.  It's still the city's official name, but locals are more apt to casually call it \"Xela\" from the ancient name of Xelajú.\n\nIt was the administrative capital of the Western Highland region in the Spanish Colonial period. With Central American independence from Spain in the 1820s it was part of the Central American Federation. Conflicts between the interests of Quetzaltenango and Guatemala City led to the creation of \"Los Altos\", the  \"Sixth State of the Central American Confederation \", consisting of Western Guatemala (and a slice of what is now part of Chiapas Mexico) with Quetzaltenango as its capital.  When the Central American Federation fell apart in 1839-1840, Los Altos was briefly a de-facto independent state, until the army of Guatemalan dictator Carrera brutally conquered the city and hung its leaders.\n\nThe city enjoyed prosperity with the boom in coffee production in the late 19th and start of the 20th century, when many of the city's \"Belle Époque\" style landmarks still seen were built.  Plans for a railway to Quetzaltenango dated back to the 1890s, and construction was started in the 1920s and finally completed in 1930. The \"Ferrocarril de los Altos\" was proclaimed the engineering marvel of the age-- until it was destroyed by landslides in 1933. The fabled railroad is still remembered in local song and story, and there's a museum dedicated to it in town.\n\nQuetzaltenango's prosperity declined from the Great Depression through the Guatemalan Civil War in the later 20th century, and for a time much of the city looked on the scruffy side.  With the new millennium, however, better times are back. The old landmarks have been refurbished and new ones added, and the city is more beautiful and vibrant than ever.\n\nQuetzaltecos are proud of their city, its distinct regional culture, and its rich heritage.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nUse the Panamerican Highway (CA-1) which crosses the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["High Lands (Guatemala)"],["High Lands"]]}," or the International (CA-2), parallel to the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pacific Coast (Guatemala)"],["Pacific Coast"]]},".\n\nYou can take a bus from many cities, including Guatemala City or Antigua, into Xela.  While the local buses (nicknamed \"Chicken Buses\" by visiting Yanquis), which are brightly painted old school buses, take these routes, they are long, bumpy, noisy and crowded, however they are cheaper (between Q.20 and Q.35 depending on the route). However,  for a few dollars more ($7.50 US in the Summer of 2006 to travel from Guatemala City to Xela), ride one of the private bus companies, such as Galgos (Greyhound style), which offers luggage storage, nice seats and quicker routes. Galgos has two daily departures from Guatemala City: at 8:30AM (arriving at Xela around 12:30PM) and 2:30PM arriving at 6:30PM. Try to arrange to arrive in the city well before dark.\n\nIf you are coming from Guatemala City the Linea Dorada is a great line, about US$9 gets you to Xela in about 4-4.5 hours with only one stop for lunch.

Minibus routes thread through all parts of the city and, although cramped, cost only 2.50Q. The bus costs less but is slower and less frequent.\n\nFor travel around the countryside, the local buses are very reasonable. They can be entertaining and, at times, quite crowded.  Do not plan on carrying much luggage with you on these: some buses have backpack storage above the seats, but most of the time you must store bags that do not fit on your lap on the top of the bus.  While they are generally safe up there, they are at risk for weather.\n\nTaxis are relatively common around the city, especially around nightlife hot spots. At night, it is not safe to walk around, so taxis are highly recommended, especially if you are by yourself. Catch a taxi on a public square rather than on one of the side streets and note its number.  Negotiate the cost of the ride before you leave. If the driver seems sketchy to you, make a reasonable excuse and do not take it.\n\nWhen using the minibus to get to Hiper Paiz (the large mall with a movie theatre as well as a supermarket) go to the back part of central park to catch the van. The guy will call, \"Hiper Hiper Hiper\" and it is 2.50Q in the day and 3Q at night. This same van also drops  you at La Democracia Market and Paiz (a slightly smaller mall which also has a supermarket).\n\nThis is also the van that you catch to get to the Chicken Bus terminal that takes you to Antigua or Panajachel. Most people tell you to get off at the Roman Columns-Minerva Terminal. You can ask someone where the bus station is or just walk down the street alongside Hiper for 4-5 blocks. \n \nThese second-class buses will leave at regular times, but if you load your things on the bus, do not get off as the driver may leave without warning.\n\nThese buses at the main terminal do make other stops prior to leaving town (7th Street and 16th Avenue, for example).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Details"]},"\nGuatemala City & Antigua - Every 15-30 min, 3AM-5PM, you change buses in Chimaltenango.\n\nPanajachel - 9AM-5PM hourly.
