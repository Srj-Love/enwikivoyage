Quincy is located between Oroville, CA and Portola, CA. To the North on Highway 89 is Greenville, CA and then Chester, CA. Quincy is at 3,432 feet elevation which brings snow in the Winter. During snow storms and fog, check for road conditions before traveling there. Highway 70 on the West side of Quincy is the North Fork Feather River in the Feather River Canyon which is over an hour's drive on windy roads and through some great tunnels and over some great bridges. Coming from the East is around an hour and a half drive from Reno, more or less.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nOn the northwest side, Quincy begins at Gansner Park at Spanish Creek on Highway 70. Then there is the Gansner Field Airport. But before this there is a turnoff West to Feather River College on Golden Eagle Ave. Highway 70 is now called Crescent Street from here to downtown. As you get closer to downtown you will notice a giant white building up ahead which is the Plumas County Courthouse. Right before you get there the street splits up to 2, 1-way roads and turns left. The east-bound road is Main Street and the west-bound road is Lawrence Street. Right after it splits up, there is another intersection which Main Street turns into Bucks Lake Road which goes out of town toward the hospital, Meadow Valley, and Bucks Lake which goes West. Going East on Main Street is downtown Quincy where you will see many small shops, restaurants, etc. If you are heading toward Plumas County Museum, you will want to go behind the Plumas County Courthouse to Jackson Street. Across the street from the museum on Jackson Street is the Plumas County Library. Going East on Main Street you eventually get to the Post Office on the left side. The Post Office is in the middle of Main Street and Lawrence Street (which is the west-bound road). A little farther down Main Street you will get to where Lawrence Street and Main Street come together again and form the 2-way Main Street again. A short distance from there is the shopping center on the right side and the stop lights. On the left side is the High School. Going past that you will start climbing up a short hill and over and back down and now you are in East Quincy. East Quincy has the Plumas County Fairgrounds which is the turnoff on the left-side. East Quincy also has a shopping center on the left and more shops, restaurants, etc. Past East Quincy and you will be on Highway 70 going East toward Portola, CA and it ends at Highway 395 which goes to Reno.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nThere are a lot of nice forests, streams, and lakes to camp and explore around Quincy. It sits in the heart of California's Gold Country where gold miners from all over came for their chance at gold in the 1800's. It is a small town of around 5,000 people with a bookstore, an art gallery, a movie theater, and a few places to shop. \nUpon visiting Quincy I highly suggest stopping at the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.plumasmuseum.org\/ Plumas County Museum"]}," where you will find a couple of buildings of artifacts and cultural displays as well as an outside back patio area with displays including a giant gold mining stamp mill. Before visiting the museum, please call to make sure they are open, their information and location are on their website here: http:\/\/www.plumasmuseum.org\/ which also includes an online bookstore.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nFishing, hunting, camping, and hiking surrounds Quincy in Plumas County in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. In Quincy you can visit the museum, go to the yearly county fair, see a movie at the theater, visit the many shops and restaurants, and spend an afternoon at Gansner Park at Spanish Creek. You can also take a short drive to Snake Lake off Bucks Lake Road. If you like golf, you can take a day-trip to the town of Graegle to the East on Highway 70 and play a round. But fishing, hiking, hunting, camping, and boating are the main attractions around this great community.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Groceries"]},{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["buy"],["name=Safeway"],["url="],["email="],["address=20 E.
