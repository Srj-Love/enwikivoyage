The Loyalist Parkway (Ontario Highway 33, County Road 33) also joins Trenton to Kingston, but by a more southern route through Prince Edward County with a ferry crossing to Adolphustown; it then follows the Lake Ontario waterfront eastward through Bath, ending at old Highway 2 (Princess St.) in Kingston.\n\nBy bus, Coach Canada stops in Belleville on Kingston-",{"type":"[[","value":[["Peterborough (Ontario)"],["Peterborough"]]}," trips.
