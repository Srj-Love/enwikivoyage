The city is known for its beautiful surroundings, Cham temples, and nearby beaches. While tourism is increasing in Quy Nhon, it tends to be local tourism, and for the majority of travellers it remains relatively off the beaten track. The city is perfect for those who want to break up a journey between Nha Trang and Hoi An, being about 6 hours from each.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Orientation"]},"\nBeing a coastal city, the sea promenade is the easiest way to orient yourself. The city itself is quite spread out. The bus station is in the southwest, just a bit too far to walk to most of the hotels.

All Reunification Express trains stop at Dieu Tri. To get to Quy Nhon from there, walk to the main road (around 5 min) and take a bus (5,000 dong). Most buses will take you to the supermarket at the city centre. A taxi takes around 15 min.  \n\nThere are also trains departing from Ho Chi Minh City that arrive directly at the Quy Nhon train station. The line name is SQN. A \"soft sleeper\" overnight train is around USD35. This train often has to wait for Reunification Express trains to pass by and therefore delays of 2-3 hours are not unusual, especially on the train from Quy Nhon to Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nThere is also a train from Quy Nhon to Vinh on the north-central coast around every other day.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nA number of minibus companies travel from Nha Trang, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Da Nang"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pleiku"]]}," in the Central Highlands.

Travel agents in Nha Trang will quote you a travel time of 23-28 hours for the Nha Trang-Quy Nhon trip, and charge 300,000-400,000 dong (confirmed Mar 2012).\n\nThere is one direct bus to ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Dalat"]]}]}," per day. Thuan Thao buses depart Quy Nhon at 06:00 and Dalat at 07:00, taking around 8 hours and charging 210,000 dong (Jul 2012). The buses are reasonably comfortable and not overcrowded, but the air-con may be weak. Alternatively take a bus to Nha Trang and a Phuong Trang bus from there to Dalat. Coming from Dalat, you can also take a Phuong Trang bus to Da Nang, which will pass through Quy Nhon. \n\nBuses to ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Pleiku"]]}]}," take around 3 hours. \n\nThe Quy Nhon bus station is in the south of town, almost 2 km from the supermarket. There is a city bus stop in front of the station. You can take a bus to the city centre (3,000-5,000 dong), but you might have to wait for half an hour. \nIf you want to walk, turn right at the main entrance of the station, walk along Tay Son Rd until you reach the intersection at the end of the road (at Royal Resort), turn left and walk along An Duong Vuong \/ the beach.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["panorama"],["image=Quy Nhon Beachfront Panorama.jpg"],["caption=Beach front panorama"],["width=1800px"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Motorbike"]},"\nLots of ",{"type":"''","value":["xe om"]}," drivers around.
