Titanic's maximum total capacity is 3547 passengers, her port of registry is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Liverpool"]]},". She carries the sixteen lifeboats required by regulations and an additional four collapsible lifeboats; these twenty boats can carry a combined maximum of 1098 people. \n\nTrans-Atlantic travel is offered in first, second and third-class price ranges, with the first class offering the most extensive amenities: a squash court, gymnasium, Turkish bath, heated salt-water swimming pool, deck games such as ring toss or shuffleboard, a fully stocked library, a variety of cafés and lounges, and dining halls where first class passengers may dine in opulence.\n\nOne way fares for the trans-Atlantic crossing (1912 currency) are a not-insubstantial £870 for a First Class parlour suite, £30 for a First Class berth, £12 for Second Class and a somewhat more economical £3 to £8 for Third Class.
