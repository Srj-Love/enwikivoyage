[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["TT Banner.jpg"]]},"\nAlthough trains are not nearly as ubiquitous and convenient a mode of travel in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North America"]]}," as in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Europe"]]},", they remain popular with some travelers because of the spacious design of the cars, the scenic routes, and the overall comfort of the train ride. Some people prefer to take trains because they do not require long waits at security like at airports, or because they are uncomfortable with flying.  Unfortunately, unlike their European counterparts, passenger trains in Canada outside the urban cores can often be off-schedule, sometimes up to several hours late. Train rides in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Canada"]]}," often take much longer than car rides and plane rides, but, when the service is running well, the unique experience can trump the long ride.\n\nAll trains will have coach seats.  For longer rides many trains have sleeper rooms. The price of these rooms depends on the quality - whether or not there is a sink, or a private shower\/toilet.  You will pay a considerable supplement for sleeper car service in addition to the regular fare.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nCanada's railway system primarily transports freight, and freight has priority over rail-line use. Therefore, passenger trains are sometimes delayed.  The country's two major railway companies, Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway, turned over operation of their passenger services in 1978 to VIA Rail Canada.  In addition to VIA Rail, a few smaller railways in remote areas of Canada also offer passenger service. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Montreal"]]}," (AMT), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Toronto"]]}," (GO), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ottawa"]]}," (O-train) and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vancouver"]]}," have commuter rail.  A large number of companies offer excursion services primarily geared towards sightseeing and tours; in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Calgary"]]}," an expensive, seasonal private tourist train to Vancouver is the only scheduled intercity passenger rail.\n\nFor travel within Canada, the passenger rail system is (for the most part) a monopoly. For long distance travel, it can cost more time and money to travel by train than to fly; for short trips, it's usually cheaper to take the bus.  Outside the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Windsor-Quebec corridor"]]},", trains can be considered to be more ",{"type":"''","value":["hotels on tracks"]}," rather than a way to get from city to city. These trains offer comfortable seats or sleeping accommodations, unique scenic views, and meals at a premium price, if you have the extra time for the experience.  Within the Quebec City - Windsor corridor, VIA Rail is more comparable to air travel; train travel will still take more time than flying, but taking the train in this region can be significantly cheaper than flying, considering baggage fees and taxi fares to and from suburban airports.\n\nIn a few remote regions, such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Churchill"]]}," in northern Manitoba, rail has been left in service as it remains the only terrestrial means to reach a remote community. Conversely, a growing list of destinations (such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Prince Edward Island"]]}," and the island of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Newfoundland"]]},") have lost all rail service and rely instead on the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Trans-Canada Highway"]]}," or other road, ship or air transport.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Peak periods"]},"\n\nThe peak periods for most rail companies in North America is somewhere between March\/April to September, however, you should check with the rail company.
