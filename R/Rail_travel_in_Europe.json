For longer distances they can be preferable to flying for several reasons. Trains have more spacious and comfortable interiors, may offer scenic routes, and do not require long waits at security like at airports. They usually run more frequently as well, and take their travellers to railway stations located in or very close to city centres, whereas airports, especially the ones that budget airliners fly into, can be up to 100 km away from the city centre, requiring expensive and time-consuming connecting services. Ultimately, many people may choose the train over the plane for the feeling of romantic travel they provide.\n\nTrains are flexible in modern day society, the opportunities for destination travel in Europe are endless. Virtually any town larger than about 50,000 inhabitants has a railway station with frequent connections. The towns that aren't served by trains have good bus connections that are normally integrated with the railway system - railway stations normally also serve as hubs for local buses. Transfers are fast and convenient all over Europe; you rarely need to wait longer than 2 hours for a connecting service.\n\nThe quality, speed and price of train travel depends on the country, Western European countries generally offering higher speed and more luxurious trains at higher prices than Eastern European countries. When bought on the spot, trains tickets can be more expensive than cheap flights over the same distance, but this difference may disappear when the tickets are booked in advance. Not to forget the costs to get to the airport. Train travel is getting faster every year through the construction of new high speed lines which travel up to 320 km\/h (200 mph), and upgrading of conventional lines to 200 km\/h (125 mph). Especially Germany, France, Belgium and Italy have extensive high-speed networks.\n\nThe one problem with rail travel is security. Railway passengers need to be alert about ",{"type":"[[","value":[["pickpockets"],["pickpocketing"]]}," and luggage theft, especially on crowded commuter trains. Since baggage isn't screened, there is also the remote danger of terrorism, though the rarity of such attacks in Europe should not cause worries to the occasional traveller. Another problem with rail is overcrowding. Increasing numbers of commuters in Europe are switching to rail travel to escape congestion on the roads, and it is often impossible to find a seat in 2nd class at rush hours. Still plenty of seats often remain in the 1st class, and some travellers choose to stay there in such situations even though they have a 2nd class ticket. Although not strictly permitted, one often gets away with it because tickets are less frequently checked during periods of overcrowding. Overcrowding is especially common in urban agglomerations such as South-East England, Benelux, The Ruhr region, and the Po Valley.\n\nAll trains have coach seating or often labeled as 2nd class in the local language. Most long distance trains travelling from one large city to another large city will have first class seating too. In some countries, such as the UK, Netherlands, France and Germany, trains have so-called \"silent\" compartments, where you're not allowed to make noise or use mobile phones.\n\nThe only trains that have sleepers are trains that will take until the next morning to reach their final destination like the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amsterdam"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Warsaw"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Munich"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Berlin"]]}," or the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Göteborg"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Narvik"]]}," route.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Planning your trip "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:2012-06-09 17-33-14 Switzerland Kanton Graubünden Bergün.jpg"],["thumb"],["275px"],["Swiss railway trail between Preda and Bergün"]]},"\nMost countries have timetables and travel planners available on the sites of their national railways. The website of the German national railways ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.bahn.de\/international\/view\/en\/index.shtml"]}," has a very convenient route planner ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/reiseauskunft.bahn.de\/bin\/query.exe\/en"]}," that covers almost the entire European railway network (and beyond), as well as bus, metro, and ferry connections in Germany. Price information is available for train rides which go through Germany only, however: for that information you still need the national websites.\nLocally, look for the departure timetables posted in the station. Staff at the ticket counter may be able to help you out with planning your trip.\n\nAn invaluable website for planning rail journeys is Seat61.com ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.seat61.com\/"]},", is not a company or a travel agency, but a personal site. Still it has one of the most comprehensive guides to all aspects of rail travel.\n\nWhen planning your trip, Mappy ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.mappy.co.uk"]}," is a good online tool for discovering if your hotel is near the train station.  Mappy always indicates the location of the station with an engine icon.  On other maps the station may be hard to find.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Tickets"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Regular tickets"]},"\nThe cost of rail travel varies greatly by country. Eastern European countries tend to offer very cheap travel. Italy is comparatively cheap as well.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Domestic"]},"\nSome countries price tickets based only upon distance traveled, so called ",{"type":"''","value":["KM-tariffs"]},". These are still common in Eastern Europe, saving you worries of advance purchase and giving you more flexibility. Many countries still using this pricing have higher regular KM-rates but have discounts for trains that are less in-demand available for advance purchase (e.g. Denmark, Switzerland, Spain). Increasingly railways are using rates based on a number of factors and selling tickets based on demand, speed of the connection, etc. in a similar fashion to most airline pricing. In countries where this is the case (especially France, Germany, Sweden and Great Britain) you should try booking in advance rather than walking up to the ticket desk on the day of travel, as that becomes akin (also in price) to buying a flight at check-in. The up-side of countries with this scheme is that advance fares can be significantly cheaper, for instance tickets from Edinburgh to London are just £25 if booked in advance, saving 75% over common walk up fares of over £100. Germany and France sell tickets for their high-speed networks identically to airlines, meaning a cross-country advance ticket might cost €19 and same-day you can expect to pay €200 or more.\n\nIn many countries with KM-tariffs there is a higher per-KM price for faster trains (e.g. Finland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Romania) while in a few countries tickets are valid for any train of your choice (e.g. Czechia, Switzerland, Austria) offering the highest flexibility and easiest to understand.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["International"]},"\nFor decades, basic international rail fares have been subject to the TCV (",{"type":"''","value":["Tarif Commun pour Voyageurs"]}," - ",{"type":"''","value":["Common Fare for Passengers"]},") which provided a common basis for calculating fares (normally based on distance) and conditions of carriage (how much luggage you can carry, what you're entitled to if your train is delayed or cancelled, etc.). In recent years more and more trains have been introduced whose fares are ",{"type":"''","value":["not"]}," TCV-based e.g. Thalys, CNL, Cisalpino, many of which are \"global priced\" - you pay the same fare regardless of how far you travel on the train. Global-priced trains are often problematic when you try to use a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["European rail passes"],["pass"]]}," like Eurail or InterRail on them, as they may require you to pay a \"passholder\" fare to get one of a limited number of seats made available for pass holders. International tickets sold don't use TCV anymore either, instead railways have assorted partnerships and offer tickets and specials for competitive prices, especially if booked in advance. It is still possible in some countries (especially in the East) just to buy a domestic ticket to the border station, and buy the onward ticket then onboard from the conductor in the next country, meaning you pay a cheaper domestic rate in both countries. It also helps to be creative, for instance a trip from Vienna to Istanbul can be made by purchasing a special discounted CityStar ticket from the Hungarian railways from the Austrian\/Hungarian border to the Bulgarian\/Turkish border and just buying to cheap domestic tickets from Vienna to the border and Istanbul to the border, saving you as much as €200 off of a single ticket.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Booking"]},"\nAdvance booking can normally be done online, through the websites of the national railway companies. For international tickets use the railway website of either country you are travelling through. Compare the fares, as they may differ. In some parts of Europe you may not be able to book these online, you can try calling the railway's hotline or using a booking service like Rail Europe (www.raileurope.co.uk). Many tickets can be printed at home, they may be mailed to you (postage payable) or made available for collection at a railway station.

If you're making a day trip somewhere, are connecting from a flight, have reason to fear local road traffic or otherwise can't commit to an exact time, ask before booking what the penalties are for missing your train, and how much extra a more flexible ticket would be.
