Operated by Wellington commuter operator Tranz Metro, this train blurs the line between long distance and commuter rail - it operates a commuter-orientated timetable and doesn't have the snack servery, open air carriages, checked luggage or reserved seats of long distance services; but it has the luggage room, long-distance seats, tray tables, power outlets and toilets which commuter services don't have.\n\nStation stops for all lines, with links to relevant city articles, are as follows:\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["The Overlander"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Auckland"]]}," -\nMiddlemore -\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Papakura"]]}," -\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pukekohe"]]}," -\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hamilton (New Zealand)"],["Hamilton"]]}," -\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Otorohanga"]]}," -\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Te Kuiti"]]}," - \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Taumarunui"]]}," -\nNational Park - \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ohakune"]]}," -\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Marton"]]}," -\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Feilding"]]}," - \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Palmerston North"]]}," -\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Levin"]]}," -\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Paraparaumu"]]}," -\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Porirua"]]}," -\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wellington"]]}," \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["The TranzCoastal"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Picton (New Zealand)"],["Picton"]]}," -\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Blenheim (New Zealand)"],["Blenheim"]]}," -\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Seddon"]]}," -\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kaikoura"]]}," - \nMina -\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Waipara"]]}," - \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rangiora"]]}," -\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Christchurch"]]}," \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["The TranzAlpine"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Christchurch"]]}," - \nRolleston -\nDarfield -\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Springfield (New Zealand)"],["Springfield"]]}," -\nCass -\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Arthur's Pass National Park"]]}," -\nOtira -\nJacksons - \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moana"]]}," -\nKokiri -\nBrunner -\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Greymouth"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Capital Connection"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["TranzScenic - Commuter Service - 1 return service on weekdays only"]},")\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Palmerston North"]]}," - \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shannon (New Zealand)"],["Shannon"]]}," - \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Levin"]]}," - \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Otaki"]]}," - \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Waikanae"]]}," - \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Paraparaumu"]]}," - \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wellington"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Wellington commuter"]},"\nWellington, despite being smaller than Auckland, has the larger (in route kilometers) and the more patronised (in passenger numbers) commuter system.

Single-trip tickets can be purchased from the conductor on board. Ten-trip tickets and monthly passes for regular trips between two stations can be purchased at ticket offices at major stations and some retail outlets across the region. Day explorer and bus-train combined passes are also available. Child fares are available to children aged between 5 and 15 years and secondary school students aged 16 to 19 who are in school uniform or present school-issued ID. Children under 5 travel free. Senior citizens (65 and over) travel free off-peak if they present a SuperGold card, but otherwise must pay adult fares.\n\nBicycles can be carried free on off-peak services on a first-come-first-served basis. Peak services operated by the silver \"Matangi\" electric trains will not take bicycles in the peak direction (to Wellington in the morning, from Wellington in the evening), but will be accepted space-permitting on Wairarapa Connection services and services operated by the light blue \"Ganz-Mavag\" electric trains\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Johnsonville line (JVL)"]},"\nJohnsonville -\nRaroa -\nKhandallah -\nBox Hill -\nSimla Crescent -\nAwarua Street -\nNgaio - \nCrofton Downs - \nWellington\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Kapiti line (KPL)"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Waikanae"]]}," -\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Paraparaumu"]]}," -\nPaekakariki -\nPukerua Bay -\nPlimmerton -\nMana -\nParemata -\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Porirua"]]}," -\nKenepuru -\nLinden -\nTawa -\nRedwood -\nTakapu Road -\nKaiwharawhara -\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wellington"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Melling line (MEL)"]}," ",{"type":"''","value":["(no service evenings or weekends)"]},"\nMelling -\nWestern Hutt -\nPetone -\nNgauranga -\nKaiwharawhara -\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wellington"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Hutt Valley line (HVL)"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Upper Hutt"]]}," -\nWallaceville -\nTrentham -\nHeretaunga - \nSilverstream - \nManor Park -\nPomare -\nTaita -\nWingate -\nNaenae -\nEpuni -\nWaterloo (Hutt Central) -\nWoburn -\nAva -\nPetone -\nNgauranga -\nKaiwharawhara -\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wellington"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Wairairapa line (WRL)"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Masterton"]]}," - \nRenall Street - \nSolway - \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Carterton"]]}," -\nMatarawa - \nWoodside - \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Featherston"]]}," - \nMaymorn - \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Upper Hutt"]]}," -\nWaterloo (Hutt Central) -\nPetone -\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wellington"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Riding the Trains: What it's really like"]},"\nNew Zealand trains are the same size as British mainline trains (in fact, the carriages on the Capital Connection and Wairarapa Connection are refurbished 1970s British Rail Mark 2 carriages), despite operating on a narrower gauge (1067mm compared to 1435mm in America and Europe). There are four seats across the aisle. The narrower size of the trains in reflected in the baggage policy.  Although the trains do have overhead racks, they are really not intended for anything larger than a handbag or hat.  All other suitcases or bags must be checked and go in a separate baggage car.  You will need to check your bags upon boarding the train and pick them up immediately upon getting off at your stop.  On the Northern island, seats all face the same direction, whereas on the Southern Island some seats face each other, convenient for a family or group of 4 to travel together.\n\nAll long-distance trains have a snack car, serving sandwiches, meat pies, snacks, beverages and wine. All trains also have restrooms with flush toilet and sink at the end of each car. Trains are also heated\/air conditioned as needed. Smoking is forbidden anywhere on the train, including the open air areas. As all trains are licensed premises, you can't bring alcohol on board unless it is stored in the baggage carriage.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["image:NZTrainback.JPG"],["left"],["thumb"],["Lounge area located at the end car of Overlander trains.  The U shaped seating allows for views from 3 sides of the train."]]},"\n\nOn the Northern island Overlander trains, the very last car of each train is arranged in a \"U\" shaped lounge seating.  All three sides of the train in the lounge area are glass, providing great views in a relaxed atmosphere. Seats in the lounge area are not reserved; you can freely move to the lounge and back to your seat as you wish.  When the lounge area is full, guests are encouraged to return to their seats to allow others to sit in the lounge.\n\nThe trains also have an outdoor viewing platform, usually towards the engine of the train.  The viewing platform has a covered roof, but the sides are open air.  It's the ideal place to take photos from the train, as taking photos through a window can result in glare.  It's probably not the best place to relax, and can be quite noisy.  On Northern Island Overlander trains the viewing area is small, just big enough for five or six people to stand.  On the Southern Island, the viewing platform is the size of an entire traincar, with plenty of space.  For safety sake always keep your arm, head, etc. inside the train. Note the viewing platform may occasionally close during the journey, especially if the train is about to go through a long tunnel.\n\nIf you are getting on a train from anywhere other than its starting point, it is a good idea to call Tranz Scenic's recorded arrival times information line at 0800-ARRIVAL.  Trains almost always do start on time, but delays at the middle stations do happen.  Calling ahead to see what time the train is expected is a good idea can save you from waiting.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["The New Zealand Scenic Railpass"]},"\nA scenic railpass provides unlimited access to all trains on the North and South islands for a period of one or two weeks.
