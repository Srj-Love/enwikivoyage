",{"type":"''","value":["Mallard"]}," is now at the National Railway Museum, York"]]},"\nThe world's first public railway opened between Stockton and Darlington in north-east England in 1825, marking the start of a railway-building boom. Most railways in Britain were built by private companies in search of profit; dozens of small companies ran local lines, merged and took over each other, as others entered the market. By the mid-19th century, these had grown into a national railway network. In the 1920s, the government decreed they all merge into the four large companies that are best known today: the Southern Railway, London and North-Eastern Railway (LNER), London, Midland & Scottish Railway (LMS) and the Great Western (GWR). What followed was a \"golden age\" of speed records, iconic locomotives such as ",{"type":"''","value":["Flying Scotsman"]}," and images of the train as an elegant yet everyday form of travel (you'll see modern train company names harking back to this golden age). Following World War 2, in which most of the infrastructure was worn down on war duties, damaged or destroyed by bombing raids, the government nationalised all railways in 1948. The resulting state-owned British Rail ran trains for nearly fifty years, during a time of change when steam was replaced by diesel and electric, large numbers of unprofitable lines were closed in the \"Beeching Axe\" as the age of the car arrived, line speeds increased, and the now-iconic double-arrow logo (sarcastically referred to as the \"arrows of indecision\") came to symbolise the railway network and the presence of a station. \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Whitley Bay British Railways Poster.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["150px"],["1940s and 50s railway posters used art to entice travellers to visit resorts by train."]]},"\n\nBritish Rail's (and now National Rail's) double-arrow logo and associated typeface of the 1960s are recognised as design classics of the period (unlike almost anything else British Rail did) but are only one of many achievements of design and engineering accomplished by railway companies in Britain. In the 19th century, majestic stations such as London St. Pancras, Kings Cross, Paddington and Liverpool Street were erected by railway companies. These \"rail cathedrals\" symbolised the success of the companies who built them and the places their lines ran through (e.g. the Midland bricks of which St. Pancras is constructed). Iconic bridges and viaducts of the Victorian era such as the Forth Bridge have come to symbolise the regions they run through. In the 1920s and 30s, streamlined locomotives such as ",{"type":"''","value":["Mallard"]}," became symbols of modernity which now symbolise the zenith of UK rail travel, while railway travel posters between the 1930s and 1950s pioneered a style of art which showcased Britain at its most attractive.\n\nDespite the lows of the Beeching era in the 1960s, British Rail rebounded in the 1970s and '80s as it fought back against the new motorways.  The state-owned corporation developed a new unified brand for its long distance express services known as ",{"type":"''","value":["InterCity"]},", and this, along with electrification of the two main line routes from London to Scotland and new, high technology rolling stock saw a boom in patronage that in turn safeguarded the loss making regional routes and remaining branch lines from closure. However, decline and neglect were still very evident throughout the system as it suffered from a lack of investment from government. With the political climate of the time favouring private operation of public services, it was inevitable that the network would be moved from state control to the private sector.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Severn Beach railway station MMB 02C.jpg"],["thumb"],["200px"],["British Rail's iconic logo and typeface from the 1960s defined the look-and-feel of the railway in the modern era. The logo still identifies a station today."]]},"\nFollowing a badly-conceived privatisation in the mid 1990s, the network was fragmented with different companies running track, rolling stock, and dozens of small companies operating trains but with heavy government intervention, subsidy and control of the system. The infrastructure (e.g. track, signals and stations) were re-nationalised in the early 2000s after a financial meltdown triggered by the fatal Hatfield crash in October 2000, and since then the system has bedded-in and developed into an effective transport system, albeit with some ongoing issues, to give a mixed public\/private-sector railway. Profits accrue to the private sector but subsidies are paid and exact services to be run are specified by the government. In fact, the national and devolved governments in London, Edinburgh and Cardiff have much greater control over the railways now than in the days of British Rail. As of 2013, passenger numbers are booming despite annual rises in fares, and many passengers buy tickets on the internet and access timetables using smartphone apps.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Most scenic routes"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Scottish Highlands via the West Highland Line.jpg"],["thumb"],["View from train travelling on the West Highland Line."]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Ribblehead Viaduct in North Yorkshire.jpg"],["thumb"],["Ribblehead Viaduct on the Settle-Carlisle Line, North Yorkshire."]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Departing Dawlish - geograph.org.uk - 1118368.jpg"],["thumb"],["Train departs Dawlish on the Riviera Line, travelling along sea wall."]]},"\nMany lines cut through spectacular British countryside and run along dramatic coasts, particularly in Scotland, Wales and the north and south-west of England.

This can apply to any of the ticket types listed above. For example, as at January 2013 a standard-class off-peak day return ticket from Reading to Bristol costs £42.50. But the same ticket type from Reading to Didcot costs £5.80, and from Didcot to Bristol costs £21.90 - a total of £27.70, saving over 34%. You would buy both tickets before starting the journey.\n\nIt is important to note that these tickets are ",{"type":"'''","value":["valid only on trains that are scheduled to stop"]}," at the relevant intermediate station. In the example above, you would have to use a train that stops at Didcot - some but not all Reading-Bristol trains do so. But there is no need for you actually to break your journey at the intermediate station, unless you wish to. There is little rhyme or reason as to which journeys can be made cheaper by this tactic, although it seems that journeys starting and finishing at major locations tend to be relatively more expensive (in our example, Reading and Bristol are both much bigger places than Didcot) - you have to do your own research, e.g. by using the National Rail site mentioned above.\n\nThere's little risk if you're using more than one separate ticket for different segments of the journey on ",{"type":"'''","value":["one"]}," train.

Most trains have power-operated doors, however you must press a button to open it, and they close automatically when the train leaves. Be aware that there may be a significant gap between the train and the platform edge. If the weather is cold and you are the last person to board, it is polite to press the 'close door' button to prevent cold weather coming in. On older trains with manual doors (particularly sleeper carriages and ",{"type":"''","value":["InterCity 125"]}," trains), you open the door from the outside by pulling the handle downwards and pulling the door open. Close the door behind you and make sure it shuts properly (the handle will return to a horizontal position).

You can visit literally dozens of these, all over Great Britain, and they are popular for a day out. Some run full-size trains, others (such as the Ffestiniog Railway in Gwynedd, Wales) use a narrow gauge, while others (such as the Romney, Hythe & Dymchurch Railway in Kent) are complete miniature systems with tiny steam locomotives.

The most common incident is theft of unsupervised luggage. If travelling with bags, keep them within sight, especially during station stops if your bags are in racks near the doors of the carriage. The UK (except Northern Ireland) operates a ",{"type":"'''","value":["railway police"]}," called the ",{"type":"'''","value":["British Transport Police"]}," (BTP), and you may see signs for them at major stations. They are responsible for the policing of trains, stations and railway property. In an emergency ",{"type":"'''","value":["all emergency services"]}," including the BTP can be contacted by dialing 999 or 112 from any telephone or mobile phone (these work even if you have no calling credit or the keypad is locked). If you wish to contact the British Transport Police themselves and it is not an immediate emergency, dial 0845 440 5040.\n\nDue to the UK's history of terrorist incidents, unattended luggage is treated by the authorities as a potential explosive device and may be destroyed by controlled explosion. You may hear announcements asking people not to leave bags unattended. Unattended bags can and do lead to closure of entire stations (particularly in London) while a bomb squad investigates and carries out a controlled explosion. Posters often ask passengers to keep a sharp eye for and report any unattended bags straightaway.\n\nSafety of rail travel in Britain is high with a low rate of accidents. After privatisation in the 1990s, the accident rate increased for some years. Inquiries found this was due to cost-cutting and profiteering by the private owners of the infrastructure and their subcontractors and this was one factor leading to the re-nationalisation of infrastructure in the 2000s. Since then, safety has improved massively and there have been very few major accidents in recent years. All trains display safety information posters on board, telling you what to do in the event of an emergency. The simplest advice is that ",{"type":"'''","value":["unless your personal safety is threatened, you are always safer on the train than if you try to leave it"]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["In the event of an emergency"]},"\n\nShould there be an emergency, such as fire or accident aboard the train...\n#Get the attention of a member of staff, any staff member will do.\n#If you cannot get the attention of staff and you are certain that you, anyone else or the train is in danger ",{"type":"'''","value":["because of the motion of the train"]}," - pull the emergency stop handle, this will be either red or green and will be visibly identified.

Do not pick up personal items. It is usually safer to remain on the train.\n#If you must leave the train, only then should you attempt to leave the train via the external doors. Methods for unlocking and opening in an emergency differ between types of train however, the emergency open device will be located at the door with instructions.\n#If this is not possible, leave through an emergency window which will usually be identified as such. There may be a hammer located next to it. If there is no indicated window, use the most convenient one facing away from any other tracks if possible.\n#Strike the hammer against the corner of the window (if you strike the middle it'll just bounce off) until both panes crack, then push them out with a piece of luggage.\n#You should lower yourself carefully from the train and move away from it as quickly as possible.\n#Look and listen for approaching trains, and possibly the electric 3rd rail.

Get off the track as quickly as possible.\n\nIf an evacuation of a train is ordered by train crew, instructions will be given. Most carriages have specific windows that can be broken or pushed open for emergency escape.\n\nA conductor or guard is present on most trains. If they have not made themselves visible during the journey, they can usually be found in the cab at the rear of the train. Communication panels are normally located throughout the train. Emergency brakes are also available, but a heavy penalty can be levied against someone who unnecessarily stops the train.
