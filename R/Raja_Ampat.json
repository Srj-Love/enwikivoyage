The amazing marine landscape means that underwater photography should be on the top your list during your stay.\n\nHowever with Raja Ampat’s natural conditions, high endemic level of land, sea biodiversity, coastal ecology, and local culture & tradition the islands offer more than just amazing landscapes to photograph.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["So you may also consider:"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["    ",{"type":"'''","value":["Wreck diving"]}]},{"type":"*","value":["    ",{"type":"'''","value":["Sailing"]}]},{"type":"*","value":["    ",{"type":"'''","value":["Kayaking"]}]},{"type":"*","value":["    Exploring the islands by boat"]},{"type":"*","value":["    Visiting the Red Bird of Paradise"]},{"type":"*","value":["    Enjoying the Karst islands around Wayag Island"]},{"type":"*","value":["    Exploring the bat caves (literally, not the Dark Knight variety)"]},{"type":"*","value":["    Make your own wood sculpture guided by an Asmat artisan"]},{"type":"*","value":["    Fishing using traditional Papuan techniques"]},{"type":"*","value":["    Trekking to discover waterfalls"]},{"type":"*","value":["    Feeding couscous"]},{"type":"*","value":["    ",{"type":"'''","value":["Snorkeling"]}]},{"type":"*","value":["    Watching The Sea Ghost"]},"\nOn North and West Waigeo, you can see a traditional bamboo flute (suling tambur) performance. This traditional performance usually takes place during religious festival, on Independence Day, (August 17th), and during visits from important officials or leaders. If you are interested in anthropology, this is something to definitely consider in your agenda.\n\nIn East Waigeo, particularly in front of Urbinasopen and Yesner villages, there is a very interesting and unique natural phenomenon, which can only be seen every year-end. A light comes out from the ocean and wanders around on its surface for about 10 – 18 minutes. After that, it disappears and can only be seen again at the following years-end. Local inhabitants in both villages call this phenomenon the “Sea Ghost”. This is more than just a sunset view, overlooking from your liveaboard.\n\nIn Tomolol, you'll be amazed by the caves in the area, where you can see paintings of huge human palms and animals which were painted by ancient cave dwellers. While on North Waigeo, you can also take in some history with a visit to the World War II caves where the Dutch and the Japanese army built bunkers. The locals will sometimes perform a war dance. There is also the ever-flowing waterfall of Salawati, which is a sight you should not miss.\n\nYou may rent a small boat if you wish to stop and make personal discoveries along the line of the beaches. As the Raja Ampat Islands have four mountainous main islands and hundreds of small islands in their vicinity, you may want to take this opportunity to explore. In addition, the Karst area is a beautiful and original natural phenomenon, as it has various unique flora and fauna as its attractions e.g., Bird of Paradise (Cenderawasih) Botak, Red Cenderawasih, Maleo Waigeo, Kus-kus, orchids, palm etc. You can also trek around the islands to find hidden beauties, like waterfalls and ancient caves.\n\nIn addition, there are also exotic locations such as the Ayau islands consisting of small islands on a very large atoll. Many islands in this archipelago have white sands with a large seabed connecting one island to another. But there are also islands with unique sands that the local community calls “zandplaat”, which are a unique habitat for local vegetation. On these islands, mothers and children of local tribes collectively catch sea-worms (insonem). \n\nFor diving enthusiasts the favorite destination is usually South Waigeo. But while you are here, why not take the chance to visit Kabui Bay with many karst islands, goa tengkorak (cave of skulls), and the historical sites of Raja Ampat in Kali Raja. You can see a variety of birds in Yenwaupnor and Sawinggrai village, the Salay dance in Saonek, and plaited handicrafts in Arborek. In Arborek, visitors can dive and watch groups of stingrays. In Sawandarek, there's a white sand beach with sea ducks and beautiful corals. In addition, there is a traditional village where you can walk around in and enjoy the unique slow paced atmosphere.\n\nYou can also dive in West Waigeo, Batanta, and Kofiau. These potential destinations are great places to visit by houseboats. The Karst islands in Wayag, especially, have very interesting natural attractions to enjoy.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nDining services are provided by the diving organizer, and range from an international menu to fresh traditional food made by the local people. Naturally, there will be a variety of seafood dishes. Do try the fish soup.
