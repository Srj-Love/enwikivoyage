Tourists can explore the real beauty of Rajasthan villages, their culture, tradition and colours through this amazing ride. Multiple operators run services for Camel Safaris into the Thar desert, which is generally followed by a cultural folk music evening, accompanied by dinner featuring local Rajasthani cuisine.\nTraveling by Camel was once the norm in Rajasthan. Roads and railroads connecting Jaisalmer to the rest of Rajasthan were built 'recently'; many older Rajasthani's remember a life without electricity, roads, and trains. If you wanted to travel from Jaisalmer to Jodphur, an 8-day camel ride was the quickest way to go only 60 years ago (currently 8 hours by bus).\n\nNowadays, however, multi-day camel safaris are primarily for the tourists, and a massive industry has been built up around them. With this has come high-pressure tactics and shoddy operators. An amazing, authentic camel safari is possible, but tourists should spend time researching guides, companies, and\/or routes. Your best bet is to talk to other tourists who have recently completed a camel safari, and ask their advice.\n\nCamel safaris are often loved or hated. Some people stay an extra day or two in the desert after already being out for 4 days, others find the camel foul-smelling and excruciatingly painful to ride. For those considering a 4-5 day trek, a two-hour ride may answer many questions.\n\nThe highlights of a camel safari include amazing desert scenery, the experience (however jarring) of riding a camel, Dal and Chapati cooked over an open fire, incredible star-gazing (no ambient light and no pollution), and a flavor of a different world.\n\nMost of the preparation is in picking the length of safari (ranges from 4 hours to 5 days), the tour operator, and the city to start from (some people feel that smaller cities offer less touristy experiences). Generally, the tour operator arranges transportation, and the Camel Driver chooses your itinerary. Be clear from the beginning, before you pay, if the trip involves stops in handicraft stores.\n\nBecause of the importance of tourism upon Rajasthan's economy, tourists are fairly safe on a camel safari in terms of physical safety. Sufficient bottled water, sunscreen, a hat, a flashlight, and warm clothes for the cold night air are important. Solo female travelers should exercise caution when selecting a camel driver\/guide, but otherwise should be safe.\n\nIf you have problems, or feel you have been cheated, be firm with the tour operator, and if necessary threaten going to the police\/tourist off, and be willing to actually go. Many tourist offices, such as Jaisalmer's, make efforts to keep tourists safe and happy.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Buy "]},"\n\nAvoid shopping at outlets guided by the local auto\/ricksha drivers or even with the local tour guide you may have hired as these outlets all claim to have some association with the Rajasthan government or the actual artisans which are generally fabricated claims and you end up paying anywhere between 20-40% above the actual price (including a hefty commission parted by the shopkeeper to the guide\/auto driver). The guide is more keen to show you all these shops rather than the places you have travelled to see.\n\nBargain is the key word. If you are buying jewelry, artefacts, handicrafts, etc. definitely bargain. Most tourist shops bargain up to 30–50% while some shops (mostly big stores like National Handloom, Bhandari Exports, Jaipur Rugs, India Crafts, Government organizations, etc.) have fixed rates with little or no scope discount on bulk buying.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nFood is generally very spicy - to be enjoyed in moderation for first timers. Dairy based sweet products are very popular in this part of the country. Restaurants are mostly vegetarian. Finding restaurants serving good non-vegetarian food could be difficult, and in general, non vegetarian stuff in road side eateries should be avoided. Bread - both leavened and unleavened is readily available.\n\nA typical Rajasthani fare would include daal-baati-churma.  Daal is lentil curry; baati is round balls made out of wheat flour and baked in charcoal fire; churma is a dessert made out of crushed wheat balls rolled in jaggery\/sugar and topped with ",{"type":"''","value":["ghee"]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nAs always, be careful when traveling alone, and avoid venturing out late at nights and beware of touts. One of the safest ways to travel around is by having a driver who knows their way around Rajasthan.\n\nSpitting, urinating and dumping garbage in public places and streets is very common and you need to watch out for this. Vehicles in India are driven on the left side of the road; therefore be aware of it in the street when walking\/driving.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\n\nThere are many clinics and hospitals in major cities which provide quality treatment at affordable prices. Also health tourism is on the upswing.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nThe State of Rajasthan apart from its heritage status is famous for its Wildlife Reserves and Religious pilgrimages. Some of the rare species of animals like Chinkara, Blackbuck, Great Indian Bustard and several migratory birds are found exclusively in Rajasthan. Sariska, Bharatpur Sanctuary, Desert National Park, Tal Chappar Sanctuary are one of the few places in Rajasthan where the rich and diverse Flora and fauna of Rajasthan can be viewed. Rajasthan also is a favorite destination for pilgrims belonging to Hindu, Jain and Muslim Religion. The Dilwara Jain temples, Pushkar temple and Ajmer Sharriff are all examples of Religious and Cultural diversity in Rajasthan. Rajasthan today is a perfect blend of its rich heritage as well as a modern State surging ahead keeping with changing times of Modern banking, Industrial, Technological development in the World.
