Its earliest signs of human settlement date back to the 3rd-5th century.\n\nRakvere is an attractive and rapidly developing town with quite an interesting character; for example, Rakvere is the place where the first Estonian Punk Song Festival took place. It’s also the host to the well-known international rock music festival “Green Christmas.” Since 1994, a biannual international theatre festival, called Baltoscandal has taken place in the unique, friendly and slightly crazy atmosphere of Rakvere. So it’s no wonder, that the motto of Rakvere is “full of power”.\n\nThe city is also known in Estonia for its youthful hip-hop and electronic music scene.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nRakvere has a regular bus connection to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tallinn"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tartu"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Narva"]]}," and to a number of other cities.
