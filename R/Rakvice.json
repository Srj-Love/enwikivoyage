One could get a beer for 15 CZK in 2005.\n\nIn the village center, you can find Beseda, a cheap and dirty low-end pub, that is frequented mostly by the local working class.\n\nJust upstairs in the same building, there is the Rakvice bar, which serves the cheapest Absinthe in the  wide region (35 CZK per 5 cl shot in 2005). It has bad ventilation though and the staff tends not to be the friendliest ever. It is open until 03:30 am, which makes it the latest-night pub in the village.\n\nRéva is a fancy restaurant, where you can get decent meals.\n\nJanami is a pension, where you can get accommodation. It is on the very edge of the village, in a part where one would hardly ever find one's way. It is in the school's vicinity and it is hard to say if it is still inside of the village. The locals use the pension for drinking beer and gathering.\n\nNext to the local pond, the pub Rak (\"cancer\") is located. It is perhaps the cheapest pub in the village, soft-drink-wise.\n\nOther two pubs are Pivoňka, where minor events like concerts take place and U Průdků, called \"Dolní\" by the street it is in.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["South Moravia"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["48.85802"],["16.81333"],["zoom=16"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Rakvice"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Rakvice"]]}]
