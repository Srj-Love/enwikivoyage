The town's heyday was the Regency and Victorian eras when the well-heeled would holiday in the town, savouring it's genteel culture. Nowadays the town remains a popular destination and has much to offer visitors.\n\nRamsgate exists in an area that has been crucial to British history. Just down the road at Richborough is the site of the Claudian Invasion of 43AD and evidence of roman settlement in Ramsgate was found as recently as the nineteenth century. Viking chieftains Hengist and Horsa landed at Ebbsfleet in Pegwell Bay in 449AD and were given the Isle of Thanet by Vortigern as thanks for their help in the first stages of the Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain. In 597AD, St Augustine landed at Ebbsfleet on his mission to convert Britain to Christianity and later became the first Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nIn 1483, Ramsgate was adopted as a limb of Sandwich and by association, a member of the Cinque Ports Confederation. Growing trade and prosperity in the 17th Century saw Ramsgate develop and throughout the 18th Century many elegant Georgian townhouses were constructed, seeing the creation of Nelson and Wellington Crescents on the east and west cliffs and many small squares. Ramsgate was a fashionable place to stay in Regency times and became the haunt of many writers, artists and philanthropists.\n\nThe building of a harbour in the town was as a result of the 1703 Great Storm. It wasn't until King George IV used the town as his departure point for a trip to Hanover in 1821 that the 'Royal' title was bestowed, after the King became so impressed by his welcome to the town. During the Napoleonic Wars, Ramsgate was a garrison town with thousands of troops going back and forth to various battles. In both the world wars, Ramsgate was one of the first places in Britain to be bombed by the Germans and during the 1940 Dunkirk Evacuation the town acted as the central port for the rescue of the troops from France.\n\nRamsgate's harbour is still a working one with the advent of the Thanet Wind Farm and it still has a small fishing community, busy slipways and a port offering cross-channel ferry routes to the continent. Ramsgate's heyday has long since passed, in common with many seaside towns, but it has a rich history and stunning views and architecture as well as a vibrant cafe culture that surprises many who visit the town.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Train"]},". Normal train services to Ramsgate leave London from Victoria (2-3 per hour) and Charing Cross station (1-2 per hour) and depending on which service you catch trains will run along the North Kent mainline (through the Medway towns, Faversham and Herne Bay) or the Weald mainline (through Paddock Wood and Ashford International) both routes will take around 2-2 and a half hours to reach Ramsgate. It is important to note that while there are occasional direct services, on the North Kent mainline most services comprise an eight-carriage train and separate at Faversham to form two distinct services, one of which travels on a branch line down to Canterbury and Dover. Likewise, eight and twelve-carriage trains separate at Ashford International and most visitors to Ramsgate opt for the Canterbury West route although if you find yourself on the longer coastal Dover route (usually marked as terminating at Sandwich but the trains always run into Ramsgate anyway) you will still, unless the train is marked as terminating at Dover, eventually arrive in Ramsgate.

The harbour dates back to the 18th century and was given it's royal status by King George IV in 1821 when he received a rapturous reception by the townspeople after he chose the port as his point of departure and return for a trip to his native Hanover with the Royal Yacht Squadron. An obelisk commemorating the King's trip stands near the Maritime Museum. The construction of the harbour began in 1749 and was completed in 1850 after several different stages of development. Some aspects of the harbour were the work of John Shaw and his son, John Shaw Jnr, most prominent among these being the lighthouse on the western harbour arm. The harbour was an important embarkation point during the Napoleonic Wars and played a vital role during the 1940 Dunkirk Evacuations: it was from here and Dover that many of the \"Little Ships\" plied their way across the English Channel to help rescue the stranded Allied forces from the beaches at Dunkirk in the face of the oncoming Nazi hordes; in the harbour stands a memorial to the event and moored at the nearby George IV memorial pontoon is the MY Sundowner, one of the \"Little Ships\" that was once owned by the 2nd Officer of the Titanic, Charles Lightoller. Today, the harbour has one of the most vibrant yacting marinas on the south coast and, thanks to the nearby offshore Thanet Wind Farm, remains a working harbour. An extension to the harbour allows cross-channel ferries to berth at Ramsgate and LD Lines (cars only) TransEuropa Ferries (predominantly freight) run services to Oostende in Belgium."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["The Maritime Museum"]}," Dominant over much of the harbour is the characteristic Maritime Museum.

Also featured are many artefacts from the various shipwrecks of the treacherous Goodwin Sands. The building is also the site of the unique Ramsgate Meridian, where the town's own Mean Time was calculated as being 5 minutes and 41 seconds ahead of Greenwich.

He lived across the road at 11 Spencer Square whilst he was teaching and he took to sketching the view he had, taking in the harbour and the building that now houses the Churchill Tavern.
