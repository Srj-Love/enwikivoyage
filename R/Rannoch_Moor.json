The moor is a rugged wilderness, though there are routes. As well as the A82 road and the railway, a number of roads take you to the edges of the moor, with some paths crossing it.

There's also an estate track round Loch Ossian, though beware of deer fence gates which are sometimes padlocked, and from the eastern end another estate track heads via Strathossian House to eventually reach the A86 road near Loch Laggan.\n\nSome walkers may be tempted to use the railway line, but this is very dangerous (and illegal). Maybe not the greatest of ideas but you can see the temptation to use something that's dry and straight when you're in the middle of a boggy moor, and when the trains seem infrequent. The line is used by freight, charter and maintenance trains in addition to the passenger trains in the timetable.  The section from Rannoch Station to Corrour has a couple of hazards to bear in mind - one fairly lengthy (and for the vertigo sufferers, high) viaduct, and Britain's only snow shed. This is an artificial tunnel where a cutting has had a roof added to protect the line from winter snows. Both these features make it difficult to see or avoid oncoming trains.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nHikers may enjoy tackling Beinn Na Lapp (a Munro) or the smaller Leum Ulleim (William's Peak), both starting from Corrour Halt.
