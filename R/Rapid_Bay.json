The original jetty has now been condemned but a new multimillion dollar jetty has been built adjacent on the northern side.\nIt is a popular tourism venue with a modest caravan and camping park but a small permanent resident population.\nThe northern extremity is terminated by a major headland which extends to the north.\nThe protected beach faces the Southern Ocean with the next landfall west being Argentina.  The sea floor falls away quickly, meaning that the water depth is significant, only a small distance offshore.\nIt is popular with divers because of the accumulation of diverse sealife in the protected regions under the old jetty which is not readily approached other than by boat.\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Fleurieu Peninsula"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["-35.52783"],["138.19093"],["zoom=14"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Rapid Bay, South Australia"]]}]
