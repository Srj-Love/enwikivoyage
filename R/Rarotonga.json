There are two duty free stores open to meet all incoming international flights.  There is a cafe open in the departures area for departing flights, but don't expect to be able to get anything to eat or drink if arriving on one of the late night flights.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nRarotonga is made up districts containing several villages located mainly around the coastal fringe of the island.  Avarua is the main village on the northern side of the island and has most of the population and services.  People tend to refer to it as the ",{"type":"''","value":["town"]},". Muri on the eastern side is probably the main tourist centre, with apartments and the Pacific Resort scattered around the lagoon.  Aroa is on the western side is a protected lagoon and beach, and home to the Rarotongan.  The airport situated in Nikao, is close to Avarua, about 2km anti-clockwise.\n\nRarotonga's main island is encircled by a 32km two-lane (one each way) bitumen road that is in good condition.  There is also an inner road that is paved, but narrow, and doesn't quite go around the entire island due to property owners.\n\nExpect a remarkable number of chickens to cross the road.  It is hard to understand why they do this, but they do.  Dogs, walkers, children, and coconuts provide other obstacles on the roads that keep driving interesting. The speed limit is 50km\/h, with 30km\/h in some towns. Allowing 30 minutes should really get you to the fartherest point on the island, provided you start off in the right direction.\n\nThe main road is called Ara Tapu.  The inner road, Ara Metua, links side roads between the inner and outer roads and have more recently been given names.  Addresses with just the village name in the address can be assumed to be on the main road, or not far from it.  The local free maps available at the airport and tourist information are quite detailed, and list the villages, and most places of visitor interest.\n\nIf you head off on any of the unsealed roads that start off heading inland, expect them to quickly peter out to narrow unsealed roads, with stream crossings often more suited to quad bikes.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nTo drive a car you need a Cook Islands driver’s license, which can be purchased from the police station in Avarua for $20 upon presentation of your home driver's licence and passport. Be prepared for a huge queue! The licence is laminated, with your photo, so think of it as a souvenir. Rental car companies issue a temporary licence that is valid until noon the following day, for a fee of $2. If you are in a group of drivers, the rental car companies can issue a temporary licence to each driver, each valid until noon the day following issue. This may work for you. If you happen to be travelling to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Aitutaki"]]}," it is wise to get your licence there, because there is no queue and it costs $2.50 instead of $20!\n\nThere are plenty of rental car choices around the island. Some operate from multiple locations.  Expect to pay around $50-$60 per day for a small car.  $15-$20 extra to pick up or drop from the airport.  The opening hours, like everything else on Rarotonga, can be limited.  Expect many to open around 09:00 and close again before 16:00 on weekdays; expect some to be open for very limited times on Sundays, if at all.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By motor scooter"]},"\n\nTo drive a scooter you need a Cook Islands driver’s license. If you don't have a motorbike licence, be prepared to do a short test, which requires you to zigzag between cones to demonstrate that you are able to control a bike. The licensing section at the Police HQ in Avarua is open from 8AM until 12PM; and between 1PM and 3PM. The drivers license office stops administering the tests at 2:30PM. It is best to arrive in the morning or as close to 1PM as possible to ensure that you can get your license. Pay $20 for the licence, and $5 for the test. If you happen to be travelling to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Aitutaki"]]}," it is wise to obtain your licence there, because there are no queues and it costs $2.50 instead of $20. On the other islands, nobody asks for a licence.\n\nIt is not compulsory to wear helmets by law, unless the speed for motorised scooters and motor bikes is exceeded beyond 40 km\/h.\n\nThere are lots of motor scooter hire options. You will find a couple in most villages. Expect to pay around $20 per day or $100 a week for scooter hire.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Rarotonga_clockwise_bus.jpg"],["250px"],["right"],["thumb"],["Digital watch owners, beware"]]},"\n\nBuses circle the island clockwise and anti-clockwise every hour. Clockwise buses leave town on the hour, and anti-clockwise at 25 minutes past the hour, and take around 55 minutes for the trip. The locals all own scooters, so it is usually visitors using the bus service. The anti-clockwise buses break for lunch, and don't run Saturday afternoons, Sundays, early mornings or in the evenings. The clockwise buses do not run on Sunday evenings either. The sign on the front of the bus states its direction. If you're going to use it regularly, you can buy a day pass or a book of 10 tickets.\n\nThe bus has designated stops on the map, and there are a few bus shelters around to wait in. However the bus will pick up and drop off almost anywhere on the round island route, although the drivers prefer spots where they can pull off the road to let traffic pass. Single trips are $5, return trips are $8, a day pass is $16. All-day family passes cost $26, for two adults and an unlimited amount of children in the one family (children are 15 and under). A pass for 10 one-way trips is $30.\n\nSome buses have buttons to request a stop, but these are just for show. Pressing them will probably see you doing another lap of the island. Simply stand up and tell the driver when you want to get off.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bike"]},"\n\nBicycles are a very practical way of getting around.  Road speeds are slow, and taking the inner road is also an option for cyclists.  It is illegal for bicycles (and scooters) to travel two abreast, and you must ride single file at the left of the lane.\n\nBicycle hire is available widely, most rental places and resorts have them. Don't expect them to be very high in quality.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By foot"]},"\n\nThe villages tend to be around 15-20 minutes walk from each other.  Most places on the island are within walking distance to a beach, an ATM or small convenience store.  There aren't many footpaths outside of Avarua & Arorangi, but traffic is slow and walking on the main road isn't a problem.

Not all beaches are suitable - some rocky beaches are not so pleasant but head for the coral lagoons and sandy beaches.\n\nMuri beach offers beautiful clear, shallow water - it remains shallow very far out so is ideal for beginners, and perhaps a bit better on the high tide.  You can also book on a snorkeling cruise around this lagoon in a glass-bottomed boat, stopping off to snorkel by a small island, and a barbecue lunch and cultural show on the other side of the lagoon, however this doesn't really take you anywhere a competent swimmer with fins can't get to from the beach.  Watch out for the currents between the island and the beach on the tide.\n\nSnorkeling can be done at the Aroa Lagoon Marine Reserve directly in front of The Rarotongan Beach Resort & Spa, you can access the lagoon either side of the resort.  The Aroa Lagoon Marine Reserve has been continuously operating as a dedicated Marine Reserve in Rarotonga as well as being a natural breeding ground for several hundreds of species of tropical reef fish.  The result is that you will be able to see hundreds of fish with metres of the white sand shores of Aroa Beach. There is no need to feed the fish! and  please avoid standing on the corals. \nSnorkeling equipment, lessons and guided snorkeling tours (both night and day) are complimentary to guests of The Rarotongan Beach Resort & Spa or are available at The Dive Centre just 200m up the road. Expect large schools of trevally, moray eels, butterfly fish, sea bream, wrasse and much more. Also expect to see octopi, clams, and eels. \n\nAlso try the beach in front of the Fruits of Rarotonga, which is where the first permanent marine reserve was established on Rarotonga.\n\nIn front of fruits of rarotonga the snorkeling is quite good, also try in front of The Dive centre - right next to the rarotongan.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Game Fishing"]},"\n\nRarotonga boasts some of the best big game fishing in the Pacific.

The Needle & Cross-Island Walk crosses the island from Uruau Drive to Wigmore's Waterfall, and the Raemaru track goes up to Raemaru Peak (350m).\n\nRarotonga was formed by a giant, rocky volcano.  Just a few thousand years ago, it collapsed into a beautiful, round island teeming with wildlife.  There are lots of small peaks around the area and waterfalls hidden in mini-sanctuaries around the jungle.  They are easy to tramp to and to bike to.\n\nThere are walks along streams providing opportunities for fresh water swimming.\n\nThe local guidebooks recommend a guide for the more difficult treks which cost around $60 which includes a lunch and transportation to and from the trail heads. For people who are experienced hikers this is not the case. The needle trail is marked with green markers. Guides are good for information on local flora and fauna. A guidebook is available at the Treasure Chest which has topographical maps along with information on flora and fauna.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Jet Blast"]},"\n\nThe Sea wall is relatively close to the airport, you can stand on the sea wall and when the jets come in it's about ten feet above your head. Check the wind sock to see which direction the planes will land. The locals call this getting jet blasted. If getting jetblasted during landing is a bit too tame, head for the eastern end of the runway: Getting jetblasted during takeoff is much more exciting (and deafening if you live dangerously and forgo the reasonable precaution of earplugs).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Windsurfing"]},"\n\nMuri lagoon is a great place to windsurf, although the winds are never really that strong, great for beginners. You can rent them in the building right beside the sailing club.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\nThere are ANZ and Westpac ATM's scattered at regular intervals along the villages of the main road.  All the supermarkets accept credit cards for supplies purchased above NZ$20 minimum.  Currency exchange is available at the ANZ, Westpac banks and Western Union in Avarua, and the fees for exchange are around $8 per transaction.\n\nDue to import of supplies, non-local foods and groceries are expensive, therefore it is worth the trip into Avarua to shop at the large grocery outlets. Expect the range available to be limited to service the small island population.\n\nBlack pearls are local produce, and there are several shops selling these in Avarua and other villages.\n\nThe resorts at the Rarotongan and Pacific have their own resort shops, as do some of the smaller accommodation providers.\n\nEvery Saturday (8am to noon) there is a growers market in Avarua, called Punanga Nui, where you can listen to live music buy music, local fruits, vegetables, fresh fish, souvenirs and cooked food platters. It ends at noon, make sure you get there before then. There is also a variety of food stalls at the market.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nLocal produce tends to be seasonal.  Mangoes grow wild, and are plentiful and cheap during summer.  Avocados are also plentiful in summer\/autumn. Outside of season, however, these fruits can be hard to come by.  Passionfruit, guava and paw-paw and oranges are other seasonal fruits freshly available in season.  Starfruit, pawpaw and coconuts tend to be plentiful year round, and these can be just as cheap at the village convenience stores as they can be in Avarua.
