[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Deluxe Room - Twin beds banner.jpg"]]},"\n\nThere is a virtual jungle of ",{"type":"'''","value":["rating systems"]}," in the world and it is often difficult or impossible for a traveller to know what ratings mean. For example, the status of the rating organization may be unclear, the ratings vague or non-descriptive, etc.\n\nThe original star ratings were introduced by the Michelin Guides for restaurants in 1933. There were only three levels, defined in terms of how a driver might reach them since Michelin is a tire company:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" one star: worth a ",{"type":"''","value":["visit"]},"; good enough that you should eat there if you are in the area"]},{"type":"*","value":[" two star: worth a ",{"type":"''","value":["detour"]},"; you should consider going out of your way to eat there"]},{"type":"*","value":[" three star: worth making a ",{"type":"''","value":["special trip"]}," just to eat there. As of 2009 there were only 81 Michelin-rated three star restaurants in the world. "]},"\nLater, the ratings were applied to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hotels#Star ratings"],["hotels"]]}," and attractions as well as restaurants, and other guides started using more than 3 star levels.\n\nMarketers are prone to dilute these terms. The ",{"type":"''","value":["Mobil Travel Guide"]}," (now the ",{"type":"''","value":["Forbes Guide"]},") awarded five stars in 2006 to 32 hotels in all of North America (US, Canada & Mexico); more recent editions award \"five stars\" to just a handful of US hotels (10 in CA, 7 in NY, 2 each in HI and IL, 1 each in TX and DC, many states zero). That does not prevent dozens of hotels from claiming to be \"five star\". Most meet Mobil's definition of three star \"Well-appointed establishment, with full services and amenities\" or four star \"Outstanding-worth a special trip\". \n\nAs the systems were designed for hotels and restaurants, very little is done to rate travel organizations such as agencies, tour operators and  transportation services. Bed and breakfasts are rated, but hotel rating systems adapt poorly to this task as the quality of a B&B stay depends as much on the hosts and the cuisine as on a checklist of hotel-like amenities. The only system for rating travel organizations is currently based on tourist-supplied reviews, which can often be biased or subjected to manipulation.\n\nTripCook’s ",{"type":"''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/tripcook.com\/ratings.html Travel Specialist Ratings"]}]}," use three main categories to assess a travel company: online indicators, offline indicators and third party (customer) reviews. Offline indicators include corporate information, valid contact details, and membership in national or international travel associations, insurance coverage, years of experience and others. Third party opinions include any reviews and comments from independent sources that can be found online or in offline printed materials.\n\nA travel rating system that is impartial, contains no marketing affiliations and uses well-constructed algorithms paired with customer reviews could certainly make the travel industry more efficient, caring and responsible. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Africa"]]}]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["South Africa"]]}]},"\nEstablishments in South Africa may choose to have themselves graded by the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.tourismgrading.co.za\/ Tourism Grading Council of South Africa"]},"  on a 5 star scale.

Each category and star level has distinct criteria which must be achieved; where the quality of facilities is superior a property may be awarded a half-star above its criteria rating. This system was originally devised to rate hotels.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" 1 star - A property is clean, well-maintained and comfortable, providing the necessary facilities for an enjoyable stay.

The programme is voluntary, but these ratings appear to be in use in tourism guidebooks published by three of the Western provinces.\n\nIn Canada, as in the US, automobile associations (CAA\/AAA) have long published their own guidebooks for members with a rating scheme based on diamonds instead of stars.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["United States of America"]]}]},"\n\nThe best known standardized rating system is the AAA (American Auto Association) ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/ww2.aaa.com\/aaa\/common\/tourbook\/diamonds\/whatisthis.html  Diamond Rankings"]},".
