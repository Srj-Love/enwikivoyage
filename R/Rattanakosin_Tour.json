Recently opened is Mulligans Irish Pub, where you can chill outside and drink a beer for 80 baht. It's a good place for conversations, as they do not have any loud music outside. Yet, the bar at the other side does have loud music, so the atmosphere is still fine.

Your best bet is to take a metered taxi, which will cost you around 150 baht.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usableitinerary"]]}]
