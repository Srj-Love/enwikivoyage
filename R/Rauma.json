Rauma is the third oldest town in Finland, and currently houses approximately 40,000 inhabitants. It is a historic seafaring town but in the 20th century its main industry became paper milling. In recent years, significant employment has also been contributed by the nearby Olkiluoto area which houses two of Finland's nuclear power plants and is currently constructing a third.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Understand "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Rauma view 01.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Wooden houses in old Rauma"]]},"\nRauma has a lot of seafaring history. During past centuries it also developed a reputation for high quality lace. Both of these traditions are actively being marketed by the tourism industry, though in day to day life they are no longer mainstream (except for the port operations, as Rauma is still a major port in Finland). Folk culture, tourism and older people try to preserve much of Rauma tradition, but as everywhere, Finland is gradually becoming homogenized due to the influence of mass media. Younger generations in Rauma these days hardly differ from those in most other Finnish cities.\n\nThe post-WWII years were mainly driven by pulp and paper milling, which cast its ugly (and sometimes smelly) shadow on the town. However, the wood industry also brought prosperity and compared to many other similarly sized towns, Rauma has done pretty well. Environmental impact (including the abovementioned smell) is nowadays rather small due to modern technology. Most of the 'smoke' you see coming from the factory area (tucked into the outskirts of the town) is actually water vapour.\n\nIn its heyday, Rauma had two competing shipyards, which have now been consolidated into one and owned by STX (from S-Korea). Combined with the wood industry and other metal industry companies, Rauma really has a blue-collar history.\n\nRecently, due to the construction of the new nuclear power plant by a Franco-German company, there has been an influx of engineers and their families from Central Europe. This has contributed positively not only to the economy but also to the offerings of restaurants and cafés. As of this writing (in early 2007), it is probable that the project and a possible continuation will stretch on for some time, keeping the foreign clientele in the town and thus invigorating it.\n\nThe neighboring county of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Lappi"]}," merged into Rauma in 2009.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nThe locals are mainly Finnish speaking.

",{"type":"''","value":["Rauma giäl"]}," (\"Rauman kieli\", or the language of Rauma) is characterized by a slightly more guttural intonation than standard Finnish. Its most extreme form is, however, mostly reserved only for traditional folk events or touristic marketing.

If you know Finnish, you'll understand practically everything; it's only the occasional word here or there that might leave you confused. However, you may have to ask your interlocutor to speak slower, because the way of speech is also quicker and more verbose than in many other Finnish dialects.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nThe nearest airport, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.finavia.fi\/airport_pori?airport_url=%2Flentoasema_pori Pori airport"]}," is located in the neighboring city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pori"]]},".
