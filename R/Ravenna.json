Follow the signs for A14D from the A14 East. The A14D ends some kilometres before Ravenna, but the roads to the town are clearly signposted. Once in the town, head for the centre (Centro). The town streets vary (as in all Italian towns and cities) with the main routes being large and navigable, the back streets being small and unsuited to large vehicles. As there are a number of ways in, make sure you have a town map before getting to the town, although this is good advice for any Italian town.\nParking is easily attained, some free away from the old town centre, and typically 3 euro for 2.5 hours on the main street near the entry to the old town within 200 metres of the Basilica.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\nThere is a train station in Ravenna; there are main lines to Bologna and Rimini.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nYou can take a bus from any nearby town, it costs only a couple of euros.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nThere is an airport in the town of Forli' about 20 km from Ravenna.
