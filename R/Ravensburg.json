There are many intercontinental flights to Munich and Stuttgart has a direct connection to Atlanta in the USA.  \nRyanair offers direct flights from London, Liverpool and Dublin to Friedrichshafen airport, which is about 20 minutes away by train. \nRavensburg has fast road connections to Ulm and Friedrichshafen. The nearest motorway (Autobahn) junctions are at Wangen (20 miles) and Ulm (60 miles).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nBeing a small city, Ravensburg's public transport network consists solely of an excellent bus network and a regional train (\"Bodensee Oberschwaben Bahn\"). \nAs most of the sites and places to stay are located in the city centre and the public transport network serves the city's suburbs, visitors to the city should be able to see everything without having to use the network. \nThe city's train station is a ten-minute walk from the main pedestrian precincts. The main bus station is next to the train station, however, most bus routes also travel across the main square (\"Marienplatz\").\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nRavensburg's historic city centre is completely intact, due to the city being able to escape bomb damage during World War 2. \n\nRavensburg is famous for its many towers and church spires. Two of the towers (\"Blaserturm\" on the main square and \"Mehlsack\" at the top end of the city centre) are open to the public for a small fee, however, there are many steep stairs to climb to get to the top.\n\nRavensburg offers a fantastic amount of ancient buildings and churches, some of which are used for retail and some of which are open to the public. The main tourist information office is located just off the main square next to the church of our lady (\"Liebfrauenkirche\").\n\nThe centre of the city is mainly pedestrianised. It is easy to explore the narrow streets, as the city centre is fairly compact. Some of the streets are quite steep.\n\nThere is a city museum in the \"Humpisquartier\" in Marktstrasse, once the dwellings of the Humpis family who where rich merchants in medieval times.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nThere is plenty to do in Ravensburg, there is a fantastic amount of shops, cafes and bars, which are all located on and around the main square. \n\nThere are several museums dotted around the city and several churches, all of which are open to the public. \n\nThe \"Veitsburg\", located at the top of a steep hill overlooking the city, offers fantastic views across the ancient centre.\n\nThe \"Basilika\" in neighbouring Weingarten (a short ride on the frequent local buses) is one of the largest baroque churches in Germany and houses one of the largest extant baroque organs. From April through October, there are free organ concerts Sundays at 4 pm (",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.st-martin-weingarten.de\/basilika\/konzerte\/ schedule"]},").\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nRavensburg is famous locally for being a shopper's paradise. There are several large department stores, all located just off the main square. There is also a small shopping centre (\"Gänsbühl\"), which is a short walk from the main square. \nThere are also many smaller shops selling everything one can think of, however, many of these, particularly the clothes and shoe shops, are very expensive, offering expensive designer articles.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nThe centre of Ravensburg is absolutely full of restaurants. There is a fantastic Yugoslavian restaurant located at the bottom end of the \"Bachstrasse\" shopping street. Other restaurants include American, Chinese, Indian, Italian and German establishments. Restaurant food in Germany is very reasonably priced and is usually accompanied by a wholesome salad. There are some \"all you can eat\" establishments, mainly in Grüner-Turm-Strasse, where there are also lots of Ethnic fast food restaurants. \n\nFor traditional German food, consider Humpisstube, next to the Humpisquartier Museum, on Marktstr. 47. It is a little off of the centre, but within the wall, and seems to be frequented by the locals.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nThe city centre of Ravensburg is crammed full of bars and pubs. Most of the pubs and cafés on Marienplatz are fashionable and a bit expensive. In Summer and also on sunny days in Winter, hundereds of people sit in the outdoor areas on the square and it can become difficult to even get a seat. A classic alternative pub for all ages is \"Räuberhöhle\" in Burgstrasse. Rock fans may also like \"Balthes\" in Marktstrasse. The \"Irish Pub\" in nearby Eichelstrasse serves Irish\/British pub food and beer.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nRavensburg offers the traveller some good hotels. The \"Waldhorn\" hotel is a world famous high-class establishment situated on the \"Marienplatz\" square, offering luxurious food and accommodation, which includes standard rooms and suites.  In May of 2012, the restaurant was closed on Sunday night.\n\nThere are several more smaller hotels dotted around the city centre, including \"Hotel Residenz zum goldenen Mucke\" and \"Hotel Storchen\". The \"Goldene Uhr\" hotel is situated in the city's suburbs, a short bus ride away from the centre. It offers high quality accommodation at reasonable prices.\n\nThe DJH Youth Hostel Veitsburg has been completely renovated in 2012 and offers cheap accomodation with some medieval flair (although most of the hostel premises are actually much younger). The hostel is only a short walk away from the town centre. However, it sits on the top of a hill, so there are ca. 300 steps to be taken from upper Marktstrasse. Veitsburg is accessible by car, too, so even as a train traveller you can go by taxi if you don't want to carry your luggage.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nThere are many flight and rail choices available.
