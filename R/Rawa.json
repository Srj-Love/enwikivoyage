[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Mena-asia_default_banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Rawa"]}," (Malay: ",{"type":"''","value":["Pulau Rawa"]},") is a small, beautiful island located 16 km (10 mi) off the east coast of peninsular Malaysia. Surrounded by clean blue waters with jungle vegetation struggling for a foothold on the craggy cliffs, the island would have been bypassed by the tourist trade altogether were it not for the soft white sands fringing its western shore. Owned by the Johor Sultanate, the island has been sensitively developed with just two small resorts. For people seeking a secluded, weekend getaway, you can't find a more idyllic location than this one.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Rawa_beach.jpg"],["thumb"],["284px"],["Beach south of the jetty on Rawa island"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nThe only way to get to Rawa Island is by boat, normally from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mersing"]]},".  From Mersing, Rawa island is a 30 mins speed boat ride or a 1 hour ferry ride. During the peak season (April-October) there are lot of ferries and speed boats moving between Mersing and Rawa, but during the off season there will be just 1 or 2 rides per day. So better check the ferry time in advance and plan the trip accordingly. Ferries and overnight stays can be booked with the resort office on Jalan Abu Bakar in Mersing, or booked in advance.\n\nIt may also be possible to come here on the way back from another island, such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tioman"]]},".\n\nIf you enter Mersing by motor cycle you may have some luggage and equipment that you do not want to leave in your bike. Rawa resort office, where you buy your boat tickets, is close to the jetty from where boats take you to Rawa. You can leave part of your luggage, helmets and jackets in the office.\n\n\nWhen booking your stay you can also book the taxi drive from the major cities nearby (KL, Singapore). The taxi from Singapore should cost SGD 130.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nGiven its small size, there is no local transportation on this island. You can walk up and down the beach along the island's western side within 15 minutes. There is also a steep path leading to the peak of the island which takes a similar amount of time to walk. The other sides of the island consist of inaccessible rocky cliffs.\n\nIf the sea is calm you may want to rent a canoe and paddle around Rawa Island, for a different view of the island, including cliffs and caves on the eastern coast. The eastern coast should be avoided in bad weather as there is no safe harbour on this side of the island and waves and wind may push you towards open sea.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Rawa_east_side.jpg"],["thumb"],["213px"],["View from the peak of Rawa island to the east"]]},"\nRawa boasts no monuments, no historical sites, no museums and no tacky tourist traps.

There is a coral reef belt stretching all the way north to south parallel to the beach at a distance of about 20-30 m (66-100 ft) from shore. Although there are some dead coral, there are large areas of healthy hard coral growth, and a variety of tropical reef fish. However, corals are deteriotating and diminishing. Beware of jellyfishes.
