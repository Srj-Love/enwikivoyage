"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Nepal"]},"; The border is open 6am-10pm, however if you need a visa and do not already have one, the Nepali visa issuing booth is only open 6am-6pm. Nepali visa's can only be paid for using USD, meaning you'll have to change money in Raxaul or elsewhere before you attempt the border crossing. To cross the border as a foreigner, simply keep walking north along the main road. On the right about 100m past the train crossing, and opposite a larger customs building, there is an Indian police check point (that's quite easy to miss). Go inside this one room building and fill in the small form to register your departure from India - leave 15 minutes for this step. The police officers inside often ask for a Rs. 100- Rs.500 per person 'fee'. There is no such thing, and they are trying to make a bribe\/tip sound official. Asking for a receipt before payment, or saying you have no money usually makes them stop asking. Once you've been signed out, continue north over the bridge until you see a large gate. Twenty meters past the gate on the left is a small one room (again very easy to miss) Nepali immigration office. This is the place to get your visa on arrival. Once you have your visa, again keep walking north until you see boom gates across the road. Keep left and walk through them, then be prepared to show your visa to one of the Nepali police officers in a blue camouflage uniform. Despite all the trucks going through unchecked, they will probably do a quick search of your bags, which is often nothing more than looking at the top two items. Congratulations, at this point you've made it to Nepal! The centre of town this side of the border is a further 1km up the road. Walk or take a cycle rickshaw\/tonga (hours drawn cart) for about ten Nepalese Rupees."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Kathmandhu"]},"; Read the 'Nepal' details above to cross the border from Raxaul to Birgunj, then to get to Kathmandhu from Birgunj, you can take a bus of a jeep (sumo).

Sumo's\/Jeeps's can usually be taken from 6am-3pm, and cost Rs 500 NPR per person in a packed shared Jeep, or Rs. 6000 NPR for a whole private jeep to yourself or your travelling companions.
