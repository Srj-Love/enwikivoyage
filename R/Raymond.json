Raymond was named after L.V. Raymond, who was the first postmaster in Raymond. In the early years, Raymond's business section was built on stilts five or six feet above the tidelands and sloughs that crisscrossed the site. Elevated sidewalks and streets connected most of the buildings. Raymond claimed a population of 6,000 in the year 1913 and had a reputation as a wild and wooly lumber mill town. City fathers resisted the unwanted reputation with promotions of Raymond as \"The Empire City of Willapa Harbor\" and \"The City That Does Things\". Raymond was the city where the grunge band Nirvana played their first gig, on March 7, 1987.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=US 101.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["directionl1=N"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Aberdeen (Washington)"],["Aberdeen"]]}],["minorl1=Jct ",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:WA-107.svg"],["18px"]]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Montesano"],["E"]]}],["directionr1=S"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Astoria"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["South Bend (Washington)"],["South Bend"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Southwest Washington"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Raymond, Washington"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["46.679722222222"],["-123.73805555556"]]}]
