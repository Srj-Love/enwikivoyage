Reading holds several Royal Charters permitting Parliament to be held there during times of plague or rebellion in London.\n\nReading grew rich through the medieval and Tudor periods thanks to a booming trade in cloth. The siege imposed by Parliament on the town during the English Civil War crippled the town's economy which never recovered. The economy of the town is historically most famous for the \"three Bs\" of biscuits (US English: ",{"type":"''","value":["cookies"]},"), beer and (flower) bulbs. However, in recent years, information technology and insurance have replaced these traditional businesses. As such, it is not an obvious travel destination in its own right, but if you happen to be here on business, there is plenty to see and do.\n\nThe Forbury Gardens ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.berkshirehistory.com\/maps\/reading_abbey\/rdgab03.html"]},", located near the center of town, have recently been restored to their original Victorian splendor. The adjoining ruins are the remains of a once powerful abbey ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.berkshirehistory.com\/churches\/reading_abbey.html"]},", sacked by Henry VIII during the Dissolution of the Monasteries.\n\nReading is also home to the jail in which Oscar Wilde was imprisoned for homosexuality and where he composed his famous ballad. These days it is mainly a remand prison for young offenders.\n\nReading is at the heart of an attractive area of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Thames Valley"]]},", sitting across the confluence of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["River Thames"],["Thames"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["River Kennet"],["Kennet"]]}," rivers amid green rolling hills, thatched cottages and pubs. It is surrounded by numerous small towns and villages such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Newbury and Thatcham"],["Thatcham"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pangbourne"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Goring and Streatley"],["Streatley"]]},", many of which are of great age and beauty. Much of it is now part of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty"]]}," with the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cotswolds"]]}," being easily reachable.\n\nIt is a long-inhabited and well domesticated area that sits at the junction of several major transport routes, both rail and road. As such, Reading serves as a major hub for commuter traffic into and out of London.\n\nIncidentally, describing Reading as a city could raise the odd eye-brow locally. Despite its size and population, it is not technically a city. To become a city in the UK a royal charter is required, and to gain a charter the town previously to have to contain a cathedral. Because of Reading's large abbey, a cathedral was never built there, so Reading was never formally made a city. This law was changed in 1889, but many people still believe it to be in force. Charters are now granted periodically with Reading losing out, most recently to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Newport (Monmouthshire)"],["Newport"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wolverhampton"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brighton (England)"],["Brighton and Hove"]]},". However, none of this has stopped a number of signs and services referring to the \"city centre\".\n\nReading has become more famous recently as the local football team was promoted to the Premier League, at least in part thanks to benefactor John Madejski, who built the Madejski Stadium located south of the town. This has raised awareness of the town throughout the United Kingdom. The promotion also led to a resurgence in the south of the town with new commercial properties, new housing developments and new superstores such as B&Q and Costco.\n\nThe town centre has been transformed over the past 10 years with a modern shopping centre called The Oracle ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.theoracle.com"]},". Further developments and apartment blocks continue to be built.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nReading is well served by London's collection of airports.

If you board in Reading during the peak morning commuter period into London, expect to be standing the whole way.\n\nThere are other stopping services from Paddington with travel times of up to an hour. Reading is also served by twice-hourly direct stopping services from London Waterloo. The typical journey time on this route is one hour 25 minutes and so is only suitable for travellers from south west London.\n\nTrain times can be found on the National Rail Planner ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.nationalrail.co.uk\/planmyjourney\/"]}," or by calling 0845 748 4950 from anywhere in the UK.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.nationalexpress.com\/ National Express"]}]}," serve Reading with express bus (UK English:",{"type":"''","value":["coach"]},") services from around the country; advanced ticketing is necessary. Note that they serve a stop called Reading Coachway, which sounds grand, but is actually a drafty bus stop near M4 J(12) with nearby amenities including a large Sainsbury's supermarket (known locally as \"Savacentre\"), a McDonald's restaurant, a petrol station and a chemist. You will need to catch a local bus or taxi (if you can find one) to take you into Reading. Buses to the station in the town centre are quite frequent during the week.\n\nBe warned that Reading's local bus services do not give change, so if all you have is a note, you will need to break it by buying a newspaper or chocolate bar from the petrol station next to the bus stop. When you board the bus, the driver will issue your ticket once the correct fare in coins is inserted into the slot.\n\nIf you are planning to catch more than one bus within Reading then ask the driver for a busabout (day) ticket. This gives you unlimited travel within Reading for the rest of the day and through the night for less than the price of two single tickets.\n\nCurrently, on a Reading bus, a daytime single fare is £1.90, and a daily busabout is £4.20, Weekly ticket for £15, there is also a group ticket for 4 persons, costing £8 per day in weekdays and £5 per day on weekends.

It is about an hour's drive from central London. The best junction to use for central Reading is junction 11 and then follow the signs.\n\nIf you are visiting for the day by car, consider using the Park & Ride site  ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.parkandride.net\/reading\/reading_frameset.html"]}," at the Madejski stadium complex (just north of M4 J11 and well sign-posted) and catching the dedicated express bus from there.  An alternative Park & Ride site is found at Loddon Bridge at the north end of the A329(M) (signposted \"Woodley\" from the motorway).  The site is extremely susceptible to flooding and closures are common in bad weather.\n\nThere are a number of car parks in the town centre, including Oracle Riverside, Oracle Holy Brook, Broad Street Mall, Queen's Road and Garrard Street.  Oracle Riverside is the most convenient for visitors as it is large and open 24 hours.  Oracle Holy Brook is not open 24 hours but is in the same building as the Oracle Shopping Centre itself (which the Riverside car park is not).  Broad Street Mall is the oldest and relatively small.  All of these car parks are pay-on-exit and none require validation; they are explicitly intended to be used by town visitors as well as shoppers.  Broad Street Mall is also directly opposite the Hexagon theatre and is used as the car park for visitors there.  On-road parking in central Reading is available only to disabled badge holders and is in the area near Friar Street.  Reading railway station also has a multistorey car park, though this is the most expensive public car park in the town.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By foot"]},"\nThe central area of Reading is easily traversable on foot. From the main rail station, you will be able to take in the Abbey Ruins, the Forbury Gardens, both rivers, both shopping centres, most (but not all so check) hotels, pubs and restaurants without needing more than shoe leather.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nBuses provide a moderately good way of getting around Reading itself (say 3–5 miles out), with several buses an hour on most routes during weekdays, and hourly services in the evenings and on weekends. Beyond that distance, bus routes are much less frequent, with often only a handful of buses per day. Route 17 (Earley Wokingham Road—Tilehurst via town centre) was extended to 24-hour operation in 2008, possibly with other major routes to follow. Reading Buses have a (legal) monopoly within the centre of Reading and through a vast majority of the area around it: if you plan to use a bus, chances are very high that you will use them. They are relatively expensive, however, costing £4.20 for a day pass (Busabout) and £1.90 for a single (as of July 2014, return tickets are normally priced as 2xsingle. Weekly ticket to the whole Reading area is also available for £15\/week. If going with a group of people, it is generally cheaper to drive and pay for a car park. Alternatively, if you have to use the bus, for between 2 and 4 people, you can buy a group ticket for £8 (reduced to £5 in the school holidays or weekends). As mentioned above, local bus services don't give change - but you can be smart and buy either single, return or busabout.\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.reading-buses.co.uk\/ Reading Buses"]}]},", telephone +44 118 959 4000, provide service within Reading and some adjoining rural areas."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.busbook.co.uk\/ Thames Travel"]}]},", telephone +44 1491 837988, provide services in other rural areas around Reading."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.travelinesoutheast.org.uk\/ Traveline"]}]},", telephone 0871 200 2233 from within the UK, provide an impartial online travel planner and telephone query service for local bus services."]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nThere are two sorts of taxis operating in Reading, although only black cabs are strictly allowed to call themselves taxis:\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Black cabs"]}," (which are not always black but are always London style taxi vehicles) in theory operate from taxi ranks around the town and can be hailed in the street.

Especially if you are not used to driving on the left, central Reading is probably best avoided.\n\nOn the other hand, a car is one (possibly along with cycling) of the only really practical ways of seeing a lot of the local countryside and villages. Here the roads are quieter too.\n\nNamed after Reading Old Cemetery, the junction of London Road with King's Road\/Wokingham Road is locally known as \"Cemetery Junction\", which is the origin of the name used by the Ricky Gervais film.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bicycle"]},"\nThe local authority has published a ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.reading-travelinfo.co.uk\/media\/81145\/Reading_Cycle_Routes_Network_Map_V5_Nov_2012.pdf cycle map"]},", which shows off-road and low-traffic routes around the town. In practice, if you are a reasonably confident cyclist you can comfortably use most of the roads in Reading.\n\nThat said, there are a few places that may be a little daunting - these are mostly near or outside the edge of town, and include the A33 (especially difficult) and A4 crossings of the M4, parts of the A33 between the M4 and the town centre, and parts of the Inner Distribution Road. If you need to pass these places and are uncomfortable cycling, there are easily-found alternative routes.\n\nThe town centre can be confusing. There are a number of one-way streets. You are not supposed to cycle in the central pedestianised areas, even though motor vehicles are allowed access at certain times to service the businesses there, and there are cycle parking stands in the middle of the area; in practice, if you cycle slowly and give way to all pedestrians it is unlikely anyone will seriously object.\n\nCycle parking is generally adequate, with \"Sheffield\" stands in the town centre and elsewhere. If no stands are available, you can usually lock your cycle to railings or street furniture provided it is not explicitly forbidden (there will be signs) and provided you don't cause an obstruction to pedestrians or vehicles. The exception to the adequate provison of cycle parking is the area immediately around the train station, which can get seriously overcrowded. You may find it easier to park your cycle a couple of hundred metres away (e.g. in Friar Street) and walk to the station. Make sure your bike is locked as discreetly and securely as possible, as bike thefts in Reading are above the national average, and the number of thefts recorded by the regional police force (Thames Valley Police) is second only to Greater London.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By map"]},"\nIf you are planning to do any visiting or exploring beyond central Reading, you will probably want to obtain a decent map of the area.
