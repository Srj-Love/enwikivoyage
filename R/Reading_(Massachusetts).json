The streets are in good condition in some places, while other roads are riddled with potholes and other relatively minor problems.  The local phone book (NOT the Yellow Pages) has a map of the town on its back cover.  Ask about the phone book at the town hall by the Old South Church in the town square.\n\nBikers be warned: there isn't much room for bicyclers who want to ride on the road, the terrain is hilly, and drivers generally aren't very considerate of bicyclers on major roads such as Main Street.\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Parker Tavern"]},", 103 Washington Street, Phone: +1 781 944-2957.
