Much wildlife lives on campus, including hares and several varieties of pretty butterflies. There are student-guided tours arranged by the Admission Office, but you can also obtain a self-guided tour pamphlet and a map in that office, or at the kiosk in front of it. In addition, there are concerts and other events at Bard that are open to the public. One thing to understand about Annandale-on-Hudson is that it is not a real town, and more or less synonymous with Bard, with no center at all (though there is a bit of land not owned by the college â€” see the Montgomery Place listing below for one example).
