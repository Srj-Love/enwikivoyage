The largest beach is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Pasir Panjang"]}," on the east side, featuring half a dozen resorts.  However, on the south end this beach usually has more choppy water and the beaches will have more debris than the beaches around the bend to the north.  The snorkeling is also found to the north of Pasir Panjang.  Scheduling your vacation around the summer school break will mean drastically fewer people at the resorts and it would not be uncommon on the beaches on the north end of the beach for you to be one of only a handful of people if not the only person on the beach.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Climate "]},"\n\nRedang has a tropical climate with temperatures steadily around 30Â°C and frequent but brief thunderstoms. Like the rest of Malaysia's ",{"type":"[[","value":[["East Coast (Malaysia)"],["East Coast"]]},", Redang is affected by the northeast monsoon in winter, so most resorts are closed and ferry transport schedules are severely restricted between November and February.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\n\nNo matter which way you choose to arrive, a ",{"type":"'''","value":["marine park fee"]}," (RM5) is levied on all visitors to the island.

As of July 2005, there was one daily flight each to and from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kuala Lumpur"]]}," (RM249 one-way) and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Singapore"]]}," (RM350 one-way). The airport is connected by roads to both of Berjaya's own resorts and to the southern fishing port, however transfers from the airport to anywhere else will require a combined car & ferry ride that must be arranged in advance. Note that the flights utilise the secondary airport of Subang(SZB) in instead of KL International(KLIA).\n\nA considerably cheaper if somewhat less convenient option is to fly to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kuala Terengganu"]]},", a one-hour flight from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kuala Lumpur"]]},", and continue from here by boat. There are half a dozen flights daily on MAS and Air Asia, with a full one-way fare costing around RM170, but advance fares can go as low as RM80.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By boat "]},"\n\nThe traditional way to get to Redang is by boat. The main jetty is at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Merang"]]},", some 30 km north from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kuala Terengganu"]]},". From Merang, the trip to Pasir Panjang takes about 40 minutes on comfortable, large speedboats and ferry boats with prices are more or less standardized at RM40\/80 one-way\/return.\n\nIn season (March-October), there are also ferries directly from the Shahbandar Jetty in central ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kuala Terengganu"]]}," to the Berjaya Jetty on the south side of the island, with approximately 1 hour 15 minutes journey.These are operated by and intended primarily for guests of the Berjaya resorts, but they'll take non-guests on board if there's space available. Ferry Fare (two-way) is chargeable at MYR 100.00 nett per adult and MYR 50.00 nett per child (Aged 2-12 years old).  Resorts can schedule on-ward travel and can accommodate even incredibly early departures from the resort area.\n\nThere are no scheduled ferries between Redang and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Perhentian Islands"]]},", however day-trip and dive boats are constantly travelling between the two, particularly during high-season, so a relatively economical transfer can usually be arranged if you have the time, inclination, patience and flexibility to ask around and wait for a boat that's departing with seats still available.  Where a day-trip is not available, it should be possible to arrange a trip from with a local boat owner on the Perhentian Islands.  A boat will typically cost around MYR 400 for up to 6 people, with the journey taking approximately 60 minutes.\n\nIf you have a group trip to redang,  Private Ship Yacht available for charter\/rent ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.asiaseayacht.com"]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get around "]},"\n\nIn a word, you ",{"type":"''","value":["don't"]}," get around Redang much. Roads on the center of the island connect together the airport, Berjaya's jetty and two Berjaya resorts as well as the southern fishing port, but provide no connectivity elsewhere and there is no public transportation along them either. While the main strip of Pasir Panjang is easily covered on foot, travelling from one beach to another will require either chartering a boat (there are no organized water taxi services) or clambering across the 1.5-hour jungle trails (actual crossing time is 30-40mins) leading from Pasir Panjang north to the Berjaya Beach Resort and south to Redang Kelong Resort. The people here are mainly Malay dealing with agriculture and cultivation with cows, goats and chicken as poultry.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" See "]},"\n\nRedang is very low on sights and most visitors spend their time lazing on the beach or exploring the corals. There's some fairly active ",{"type":"'''","value":["wildlife"]}," though, including inquisitive monkeys (don't feed them), energetic squirrels and large monitor lizards.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Do "]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Snorkeling"]}," is the number one activity on Redang and rightly so as the coral reefs are quite spectacular. Many resort packages include snorkeling tours by boat to nearby islands, but there are some decent reefs right off Pasir Panjang. The best of the lot is at the southern end next to the aptly named Redang Reef Resorts, and the small hill\/island in the middle of Pasir Panjang is a nesting ground for baby sharks.  It is very important to be concious while snorkeling if you are using fins as it can take many years for the coral to re-grow.  The snorkeling is quite protected making the water quite calm and fins are not necessary.\n\nRunning a close second in the popularity contest is ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["scuba diving"]]}]},". The waters around the island are usually crystal clear - although visibility can drop dramatically after a storm - and home to a host of sea creatures including turtles and reeftip sharks. While Redang caters to divers of all levels and is a popular place to complete a diving course, some of the sites further out can have fairly strong currents. More or less every resort on the island has its own dive shop, but it may be worth looking beyond the house shop as quality varies considerably.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Coral Redang Divers"]},", Pasir Panjang (",{"type":"''","value":["at Coral Redang Island Resort"]},").
