Away from the hustle and crowded feel of Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach. Originally called Hollywood Riviera because so many of Hollywood came there to escape, it now has a more European feel to it. Some great place to grab a bite to eat, or if you want to grab some food and walk to the beach, stop in to Trader Joes. The Village is basically a triangle with the water on the west side, PCH on the east side, and Palos Verdes Drive along the south side. The beaches here are less crowded and parking is pretty easy. You can pay at meters along the Esplanade or drive a few blocks inland and park for free.\n\nRun the steps (all 72 of them) at Avenue C on the Esplanade.

Location is at the west end of Torrance Blvd. Plenty of parking, in shade (nice in Summer)\n\nSeveral miles further south is Riviera Village, a charming little shopping and eating district. As property values have soared in the area, the Village has \"Yuppified\", but retains its small seaside feel.  Location is along Catalina Avenue and Vista Del Mar streets. Interestingly, only one of these shops has seating outside where one can actually view the ocean. It's at the NW corner of Catalina Avenue and I street.\n\nBetween the above 2 locations along the Esplanade (street) offers great ocean views and access to a superb stretch of beach.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Kinkaids"]},{"type":"*","value":["Charthouse "]},{"type":"*","value":["Fatburger"]},{"type":"*","value":["Rinaldi's: An Italian deli that makes you think twice about what goes into the perfect sandwich.
