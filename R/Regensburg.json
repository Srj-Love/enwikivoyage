Acting as capital of the district of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Upper Palatinate"]]}," and also its biggest settlement, Regensburg today is a thriving city of about 137,000 inhabitants, two universities and many landmarks and little chapels, most dating back to the Middle Ages (e.g. the Cathedral of St. Peter, the Old City Hall and Imperial Diet, and the Stone Bridge). According to legend there are so many chapels here, that there would always be at least one church bell ringing. Since 13.07.2006 the historic city center of Regensburg and Stadtamhof has been a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["UNESCO World Heritage List"],["UNESCO World Heritage site"]]},".

For the following 200 years the fortress served as the Romans main military base in the province of Raetia. After the Romans left the area during the Barbarian Invasions, the town became a civil settlement. Being granted one of the first seats of a bishopric on German territory in 739, Regensburg grew to strength and prosperity during the Middle Ages. After the completion of the Stone Bridge (",{"type":"''","value":["Steinerne Brücke"]},") in 1146, a symbol of the town's importance in trade, that reached as far as Paris, Venice or Novgorod, the constructions of the cathedral started in 1273. The builders needed nearly 600 years until 1872 to complete this task. Both the Stone Bridge and the Regenburg Cathedral survived unchanged and are the city's main sights today. Having been one of the largest and most important German cities during the Middle Ages, Regensburg became a Free Imperial City (",{"type":"''","value":["Freie Reichsstadt"]},") in 1245 and was seat to the Perpetual Diet (",{"type":"''","value":["Immerwährender Reichstag"]},") of the Holy Roman Empire from 1663 to 1806, when the Empire dissolved during the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon forced Regensburg to agree to become a part of the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1810, which set an end to the city's political importance. However, Regensburg economically regained strength because of its role as a river port for crude oil imports from Eastern Europe. Although Regensburg was target to 20 allied bombings during World War II, because it was home to one of ",{"type":"''","value":["Messerschmitt's"]}," main aircraft factories as well as an oil refinery, the historic city center took only little damage. There were two sub-camps of the ",{"type":"''","value":["Flossenbürg"]}," concentration camp located in the vicinity of the town for a brief period of time in early 1945. After World War II Regensburg slowly recovered. In 1960 the university was founded and several large companies like Siemens, BMW, Infineon, and Toshiba built factories in the city.
