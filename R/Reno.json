A destination with something to offer for everyone. The second largest tourist destination in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nevada"]]},". Featuring great resorts designed to accommodate every taste. Gaming and family entertainment, outdoor activities, festivals, museums, fantastic cuisine, shows for everyone, art and culture. All steeped in a rich, diverse, and rugged history. This is it, the gateway to the old west. This is where the historic Johnson-Jeffries fight happened. This is where Marylin Monroe and Clark Gable made \"the Misfits\" in 1961. Where the railroad tumbles down out of the mountains from California to cross the Truckee River and begin the long journey east. It's difficult to walk the streets of Reno without seeing the history in this dynamic city.\n\nMost Renoites consider the start of it all to be 1859, when Charles Fuller built a log bridge across the Truckee River and started charging to cross over it on the way to the Gold Rush in California or coming back to Nevada for the \"Washoe Rush\" in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Virginia City (Nevada)"],["Virginia City"]]},". Fuller set up shelter for weary travellers to rest. He served meals at a price, and created an opportunity for prospectors to exchange stories and information.\n\nThe town site of Reno, named after Civil War General Jesse Reno, was established on May 13, 1868.\n\nSince its beginning, Reno has spread across much of the Truckee Meadows.  Reno and Sparks (a smaller adjacent city) now spread across this small valley separating the Sierra Nevada mountains to the West and Nevada's expansive desert areas to the East.\n\nThe profiteering characteristic of the founders may have occasionally plagued the course of Reno's subsequent generations.  Some Renoites claim Nevadans are simply of a freer nature.  Others think the city has repeated the steps of the goldrush era founders.  Certainly, the choices made today are what will determine the true nature of the community.  Regardless, Reno enjoys a pretty decent quality of life with 4 seasons, winter and summer fun, a major university, and plenty of other entertainment.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Imperial"],["janhigh = 45"],["febhigh = 51"],["marhigh = 56"],["aprhigh = 64"],["mayhigh = 72"],["junhigh = 82"],["julhigh = 91"],["aughigh = 89"],["sephigh = 81"],["octhigh = 70"],["novhigh = 55"],["dechigh = 46"],["janlow = 19"],["feblow = 24"],["marlow = 27"],["aprlow = 31"],["maylow = 38"],["junlow = 44"],["jullow = 49"],["auglow = 47"],["seplow = 41"],["octlow = 32"],["novlow = 25"],["declow = 20"],["janprecip = 1"],["febprecip = 0.9"],["marprecip = 0.8"],["aprprecip = 0.4"],["mayprecip = 0.7"],["junprecip = 0.4"],["julprecip = 0.3"],["augprecip = 0.2"],["sepprecip = 0.3"],["octprecip = 0.4"],["novprecip = 0.8"],["decprecip = 1"],["description = ",{"type":"{{","value":[["ForecastNOAA"],["Reno"],["39.52748"],["-119.81346"]]}]]},"\n\nReno is at the western edge of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Great Basin"]]},", a zone stretching to Salt Lake City that does not drain to the sea - water is carried away by evaporation only.  Average rainfall is approximately 7 inches a year, with much of that occurring in the winter in the form of snow.  July is the warmest month, with an average high of 91°F, and January is the coldest month, with an average low of 19°F.\n\nReno is in Northwestern Nevada, at the base of the Sierra Nevada mountains, and serves as the urban center for a region including nearby Carson City and the Carson Valley, Lake Tahoe, Pyramid Lake, and historic mining town Virginia City, home of the Comstock Lode.  Along with the city of Sparks, Reno is located in the Truckee Meadows, and together they form the Reno-Sparks Metropolitan Area.\n\nCompetition in the last years of the 20th century slowed down the gambling business in Reno considerably.  Given that its downtown centered around these activities for a good 50 years, the same downtown suffered.  Downtown today has weathered the storm, and is improving with projects like a baseball and entertainment district and several condo projects that were completed despite economic slowdown.  Growth in the area has continued due to its livability.  Reno is working hard to build a different kind of city for a greater variety of tastes, and keeping that in mind will help the visitor see the town through the right kind of eyes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["From Northern California"]},"\n\nAs both Reno and the Sierra Nevada are popular weekend destinations for Northern Californians, traffic can be bad coming to Reno on Friday evening, and leaving Reno on Sunday evening, especially in the ski season.\n\nThe most direct route to Reno from Sacramento is via Interstate 80 over Donner Summit (7239 feet or 2206 m).  This route sees a great deal of snowfall during the winter, and will shut down for periods of up to a day several times during a typical winter.  Northern California residents also use U.S. 395 in Susanville, this highway stays at a lower elevation and has less problems of traffic and weather. Residents living in the Redding and Chico areas of California find this route safer and quicker. If you plan on crossing this or any other pass in the Sierra Nevada in the winter, keep an eye on the weather forecast, and always carry tire chains if you do not have four-wheel drive.\n\nAn alternative route is US 50 over Echo Summit (7330 feet).  This route follows the American River up from the Sacramento valley, and then drops into the Lake Tahoe Basin.  From there you can continue on US 50 into ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Carson City"]]},", and from there head north to Reno on US 395, or continue around the lake to Incline Village and drop into Reno on the Mount Rose Highway.  This route is two lanes only for much of the way, and traffic can be heavy both in the winter and the summer, and winter maintenance is not as good as on Interstate 80.\n\nPasses across the Sierra south of US 50, aside from CA 88, are not maintained in the winter (from approximately November until May.)  And when they are open they are out of the way and potentially dangerous.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["From Southern California"]},"\n\nThe most direct route to Reno is via US 395.  This route takes you up the Owens Valley to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bishop"]]},", past ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mammoth Lakes"]]},", into ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Carson City"]]}," and thence to Reno.  The portion between Bishop and Carson City crosses three passes as high as 8,143 ft (2,482 m) that may have moderately heavy snowfall during winter storms.  In that event it would be better to take U.S. 6 from Bishop over Montgomery Pass to U.S. 95 (north) which stays in much lower valleys with less snow.  At Schurz beyond Walker Lake take 95(Alt) north to Fernley, then I-80 west to Reno.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["From Las Vegas"]},"\n\nDon't be fooled by the fact that Las Vegas and Reno are in the same state - there's about 8 hours of driving time separating them.  Take US 95 north to Fallon, US 50 west to Fernley, and Interstate 80 west to Reno. If you're not a fan of desert landscapes, boredom is a serious risk on this trip.  Winter weather will generally not be a large problem on this trip, but don't count on being able to find food or fuel outside the major towns (Beatty, Tonopah, Hawthorne, Fallon, and Fernley)\n\nDuring the summer the heat along US 95 can be hard on you and on your vehicle.   A much more comfortable alternative to cooking in your car is to drive during the night.  Many of the dark stretches between the small towns along US 95 reveal numerous shooting stars and other astral phenomena that you might miss during the baking sun. Keep in mind that driving at night can be dangerous due to the visibility limitations from the hills and the mountains.  Be sure to have a lot of rest before undertaking this trip.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["From the East"]},"\n\nThe most traveled route to Reno from the east is Interstate 80.  Interstate 80 follows the old Emigrant trail along the Humboldt river for most of the way across Nevada, and thus the grades are generally easy.  However, it does this at the expense of swinging well north of the direct route to Reno.  US 50 (\"The Loneliest Highway in America\") is more direct, but it crosses several large mountain ranges and thus has some tight curves, steep grades and a few switchbacks.

Peavine mountain has many networks of trails that are a biker's paradise, most of it singletrack, and most of it technical. Many cyclists start near Rancho San Rafael Park to access the Peavine trails. Be careful, however, as there are often gun-happy residents shooting away, not always sober, farther out in the government lands; also be sure to bring plenty of water, as the desert heat can be quite oppressive.
