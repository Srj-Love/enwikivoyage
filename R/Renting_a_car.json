[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["TT Banner.jpg"]]},"\nTravelling by car can get you places which can be very difficult to reach by public transport or tour.  It gives you the convenience of going your own way, in your own time, and it can often be cheaper than public transport alternatives, especially if travelling as a couple or a group.\n\nThe downside is that in some places, traffic conditions may differ wildly from what you are used to, and foreign conditions can add stress to your travels that you can do without.  See ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Driving in China"]]}," for one example.  In some circumstances it may be better to rent a car with a driver. In countries where wages are low, this may not cost significantly more than the cost of the car alone.   \n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Pricing "]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Base price "]},"\n\nPrice is normally calculated by number of days. Usually the more days you take, the less you pay per day.  Cars are classified according to a class, small to large, prestige and specialty vehicles, and there is a sliding scale of prices for each car class.  When you book you are usually given an example of a car type in that class, but it need not be that type you are receiving.\n\nRental car companies normally permit a small amount of time, usually around an hour, for late returns.  After that they can charge up to another full day rental for a late return.  If you know you are going to exceed the rental period you can often call the rental company and arrange an extension.  Normally the standard contract rate (without discounts) would apply.\n\nMost ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.kreativetravelindia.com rental companies"]}," have a one day minimum rental period.  Price for durations less than a day normally are not regulated. If you need to return the car at significantly different time of the day, you can try haggling to get extra hours for free.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Insurance Surcharges "]},"\n\nIf the car is damaged or stolen, or if your car damages another or injures or kills someone, your liabilities (to the rental agency and\/or others) can go far beyond the fee you agree to pay for the rental.  In addition to paying for any repairs required, the rental car company will charge you for any loss or revenue while the car is being repaired, and administration costs for managing the repair.\n\nUsually when you come to rent a car you are presented with several insurance options.  Some of these are\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Collision Damage Waiver - sometimes included in the rental cost, this reduces your liability in case of an accident to a fixed amount advised by the rental agency."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Theft Liability Waiver"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Windscreen Breakage Insurance - sometimes a small extra daily fee will cover you against the cost of windscreen damage"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Excess Reduction\/Super-CDW - reduces the deductible amount in case of an accident to a lower or sometimes eliminates all liability.  Can be a substantial cost on top of the base price amount."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Third party insurance"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Personal Effects Insurance - covers loss of personal items in the car when it is stolen or damaged."]},"\nYou should take the time to consider the insurances offered, how they effect your liability, their cost, and whether your personal car insurance, travel insurance or charge card (used to rent the car) provides partial or full coverage.  Sometimes some of these insurances and surcharges are compulsory, e.g., in foreign countries where your personal insurance doesn't offer coverage.  Sometimes some coverages are built into the base rate.\n\nIf insurance or waivers are optional, consider the following before accepting the charge:\n# As above, if you have an automobile insurance policy on your vehicle at home, check to see if it includes coverage for rental car damage.\n# If you plan to pay with your credit card, check also to see if it includes rental car coverage.  Be aware that in many cases this coverage is secondary (meaning your existing auto insurance coverage pays first).\n# If you have purchased a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["travel insurance"]]}," policy that covers trip cancellation, medical expenses, etc., check to see if it includes a rental car collision\/loss benefit.  Some packages do, providing primary coverage up to a certain amount.  (Primary coverage means that the insurance pays before other policies, including your own auto insurance.)  Depending on the amount of insurance you buy, the per-day charge for a travel insurance policy that includes rental car coverage can work out to less than the per-day amount of a waiver.  It is ",{"type":"'''","value":["usually cheaper to purchase travel insurance"]}," than to pay for the Excess Reduction\/Super-CDW at the rental counter.\n\n\nRental companies tend to prefer bona-fide visitors rather than local renters when it comes to excess levels and excess reduction.  Sometimes these are lower for international visitors booked in advance, for airport renters with a flight number, or for people using a corporate discount code.\n\nMany of the insurances are void if you use the car in a manner not permitted by the contract, e.g., driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, using it to commit a crime.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Distance charges "]},"\n\nSome rental agreements may have a limit on how far you can travel per day or in total, and will charge for additional distance traveled.   Others have unlimited mileage.\n\nEven with unlimited miles, you may see limits that confine you to adjacent states or regions.  Getting those limits relaxed may involve added fees; violating them may generate stiff penalties...all in the rental contract.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Other surcharges "]},"\n\nRental car companies are notorious for finding additional surcharges, sometimes not added until the point of sale.  These can include location or airport taxes, improvement fees and other surcharges, admin surcharges, registration recovery surcharges and other local taxes.  Sometimes local taxes are not just the local sales taxes, but also local vehicle taxes that are \"recovered\".  At the Las Vegas airport, such fees can increase the cost of a rental by close to 60 percent.\n\nThis practice has become so notorious that some consolidators promote themselves on the basis they guarantee to offer a fully inclusive price, but check the fine print.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Discounts "]},"\n\nIf you work for a large corporation, you may be elegible for the corporate (employee) rate when renting a car with some of the larger rental companies in any worldwide location. Extra benefits may also include a reduced excess. Check with your company for a discount code that may apply.\n\nSimilarly, members of professional societies, alumni societies, or even travellers with a partner airline can access discount codes.  If you don't have travel insurance a discount code that lowers the excess (deductable) to a moderate amount can worth a significant part of the rental cost.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Choosing a car and optional extras "]},"\n\nYou need to choose a car to meet your needs.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" If you can't drive a manual (stick-shift) check that your car will be automatic."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Check there is room for all the passengers and luggage you will be carrying.

Having a GPS when driving in a new city can save considerable amount of time until you get your bearings.  Check the price carefully, as GPS rental for a week can sometimes cost as much as a new GPS.\n\nRental car companies often rent child seats of booster seats.  If you are flying with a young child, sometimes you can take your seat on the plane to save the cost of this hire.  Make sure the seat you have will attach to the car you are hiring and complies with the relevant standards.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Restrictions "]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Locations "]},"\nIf you are considering driving to a different country from that where you have rented your car, ensure that the insurance will also cover this. Even in places such as the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["European Union"]]}," where many countries are close to each other, each car rental company can have different policy coverage.\n\nThere are sometimes exclusions for certain areas inside the same country. In Australia your insurance may not cover going to remote 'offroad' regions with a standard car. For example ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kangaroo Island"]]}," is often excluded when renting your ca from nearby ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Adelaide"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Age "]},"\n\nIt is common to restrict rentals to only drivers over the age of 21, and to apply a surcharge on drivers under 25.  \n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Licence "]},"\n\nSome companies insist that your licence have been valid for a period of time.  Provisional licences can be problematic, and learners permits are always forbidden.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Driving record "]},"\n\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Booking and haggling "]},"\n\nThe decision over whether to book in advance or whether to shop around on arrival can be difficult, and depends on the location and the time.\n\nWhen renting with major rental agency at major western airports a reservation doesn't guarantee your rental.  On their side, the rental agencies overbook, and on your side you can usually make a reservation without any commitment and cancel at any time with no penalty.  Although a reservation will not guarantee you a car in this case, it will give you priority over someone without a reservation.\n\nSome things to consider when choosing whether to book or turn up and try for a better standby rate.\n",{"type":"*","value":[" If you book a small economy car, it is quite common to get upgraded at the airport if those cars have sold, in which case you will get the upgrade at no additional cost.

This option may be offered free as part of an extended period of rent (e.g. 1 week and more, as for Budget in Portugal). In this case, an agent comes with a full set of papers, everything is filled out on spot and may not need to visit rental office at all.  Other rental car companies may pick you up in the car, and take you back to the rental car agency to fill out the paperwork.  This is mainly so their driver has a way to get back to the rental car office, rather than being left stranded at a hotel without a car. \n\nIf your hotel has only paid parking around it, it is your responsibility to pay for parking time required for an agent to prepare papers with you.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Payment and security deposit"]},"\n\nRental companies invariably require a mechanism to have a security deposit in case of damage, fines or even failure to return a car.\n\nMany operators require that they have a true ",{"type":"'''","value":["credit card"]}," that they can make charges against, often rejecting debit cards that can have the money withdrawn from them.  Usually a hold will be placed on a credit card for a security deposit amount. However. in many cases they mean a card with protruding card details text, i.e. number, expiration, cardholder's name (cards like Visa Classic or Mastercard)--as opposed to Visa Electron or Cirrus\/Maestro.\n\nRenting with cash only is unusual, and your should check with the rental company that it is acceptable.  If permitted it involves paying an amount of cash as a deposit roughly equal to your maximum liability which can be many times the cost of the rental.  Some rental companies will accept payment for the rental in cash, as long as there is credit card available for the security deposit.\n\nThe security deposit amount held is not usually fixed in your contract.  If having part of your credit card limit held may impact some other part of your holiday plans, you should check with the rental agency.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Before you set out "]},"\n\nMake sure you know:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" what to do in case of accident; breakdown when you still can drive; breakdown if you cannot"]},{"type":"*","value":[" any local specifics of driving rules and conventions"]},{"type":"*","value":[" controls of the car that differ between car manufacturers (reverse gear, seat adjustment, lights, radio, opening gas\/fuel tank, opening trunk\/boot, opening hood\/bonnet,  etc)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" what kind of fuel is recommended, and how it is marketed at your destination (A98 vs A80; petrol in a diesel engine--both can prove an expensive mistake)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" known issues of this car model, of this particular hire car"]},"\nAnd ",{"type":"''","value":["before you move the car"]},", adjust your seat and then all mirrors to met your needs.\n\nFrequently you will be provided with a free driving map of the region.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Checking initial condition "]},"\n\nBefore you go, check the exterior and front glass of the car and ask personnel to mark in the contract every scratch and dent you find, and sign the scheme on both copies of your contract, or even keep digital photos of the condition of the car and picture any damages at time of pick up and at time of drop off.  When you return the car, it will be checked against the scheme you put in the contract.  You can save considerable hassles at the end of the rental by just taking the time to note every scratch and dent.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Filling the tank "]},"\n\nNormally, a rental car is expected to be returned with the same fuel level as when rented. \n",{"type":"*","value":[" If the tank is not full when the car is returned but it was when it was received, you may be charged a premium - up to three times the cost of the fuel - for the tank to be filled."]},{"type":"*","value":[" If the fuel indicator indicates less than full, do not leave without a rental agent noting it."]},"\nSome agreements offer you purchase of fuel at an attractive discounted rate.  In this case make sure you are going to be driving enough to empty the tank, and that you can return it virtually empty.  Many rental sites will charge you to fill the tank as though it is totally empty, not for the actual gallons\/liters needed to fill it.\n\nNormally, the most economical approach is to agree to return the car full.  Note that:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Gas stations close to your rental site may charge considerably more, so you might refill large amounts elsewhere."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Some rental sites may ask for a \"fill-up receipt\" as an indicator the tank has not been used much since being filled; you might just top-off the tank near their site."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":[" If the car breaks down "]},"\n\nThe rental car agency will provide a number to contact in case of problems with the car.  Make sure you contact this number first, because they usually will have agreements with service organisations to fix or move the car.  If you incur costs of towing, etc, without contacting them you may make yourself liable for the cost.\n\nIf you have a flat tyre, or similar, and the cost won't be covered by the rental car company, it may just be simpler to get the tyre fixed then to arrange service through the rental car company, who may end up charging you more.  However, if the repair will be covered by your travel insurance, you may want the rental company to arrange the repair so the paperwork is complete.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Returning a car"]},"\n\nNormally you return the car to a rental office at your final point in their working hours and have a final calculation done there.\n\nAt smaller locations, sometimes the office will be unattended, and have a lot to park the car, and a drop box for the keys.\n\nIf you arrive at the office when it is closed, and you can't return it when open, it usually works to leave the car in the lot, or nearby and place the keys, contract and the information about the car somewhere secure and obvious.  You will remain liable for the car until the office opens, and will usually also be charged up until that time.\n\nWith a pick-up-at-hotel option (see \"Delivering the car to your location\" above), you only need to park a car (for paid parking, pay for the next 1 hour) and hand keys to an agent that comes to the hotel (with a cheque for parking payment if applicable).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["If you damage the car"]},"\n\nIf you incur damage to the car the car rental company will initiate the standard process that they have for vehicle damage.  They will identify the damage, and you will be required to fill in and sign an accident report form.  If the office is unattended at the time you return the car, they will contact you and advise you to fill in the form and return it to them.\n\nThey will charge or place a hold on your credit card for the full amount of any excess that was defined in rental agreement, even if that is obviously greater than the value of the damage.  They will obtain quotes for the repair, and advise you the cost of the repair, and their administration cost.  This process can take up to a month to complete.  If this cost is greater than your excess, then that completes the process.  The rental car company retains the excess.  Otherwise, your card will then be refunded for the difference.\n\nThis is usually clearly explained in the documentation that the company will produce when you return a damaged car.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Choosing an operator "]},"\n\nMajor global car rental companies have famous brands that operate in many countries throughout the world, for example Avis, Hertz, etc.  Sometimes the regional operator can be an independent company using the name under licence, and often the local operator is just a franchisee.  These major brands allow bookings through all the electronic booking services, and there is a seemingly endless amount of Internet booking services that allow you to do comparison searches between them.\n\nUsing a global operator can have advantages.  They often have priority \"clubs\", which record your details in advance, and can make renting a car as simple as just picking up the keys.  You can generally rely on them operating out of prime locations, such as in the airport terminal, rather than in the shed down the street.  They usually run cars for a short period of time before updating their fleet.  However, don't think that because you are renting from a global operator you can rely on them to do the pre-rental car inspections correctly, or that their terms and conditions of rental are consistent.  \n\nThe next level is the national or regional chain.  Many countries have national operators, which may also operate out of a few neighbouring countries in the region.   Sometimes these operators can also have prime locations, and sometimes they operate using shuttles or from less prestigious sites.\n\nThe next level is the purely local operator.  It is unusual for these operators to have the prime locations, often they operate from less prestigious sites.   The rental car industries sees its share of shady operators, and often they can be found in this category.  This is unfortunate, as many of these operators can offer good value, and good service.  It pays to seek out some local advice or reviews.\n\nOften the choice is one between brand, price and convenience.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Traffic direction "]},"\n\nIn some countries, traffic moves on a different side of the road from what you are used to at home. In the USA, continental Europe, China and most countries of the world, traffic moves on the right side of the road. On the other hand, in the UK, Japan, Thailand, Indonesia and many former British colonies such as Australia and Hong Kong, traffic moves on the left side of the road. In general, cars in countries that drive on the right are left-hand drive (i.e. the steering wheel is on the left side of the car), and cars in countries that drive on the left are right-hand drive, though there are some exceptions.\n\nUsually, adapting to driving on the other side of the road, and operating the steering wheel on the other side of the car takes some time, but does not pose any major issues. It is advisable to start driving slowly while you familiarise yourself with the new configuration and road conditions, and ensure you stay alert at all times while you adjust to the switch. You will probably feel awkward at first, but it will become more natural the more you drive. Pay particular attention when crossing international borders, as you may sometimes have to switch sides of the road after crossing the border (eg. Hong Kong-China border; Thailand-Cambodia border).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" See also "]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Renting a motorhome in New Zealand"]]}]},", "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Offroad driving#Hiring a car"],["Offroad driving"]]}]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Tips for road trips"]]}]},"."]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usabletopic"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["PartOfTopic"],["Driving"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Car rental"]]}]
