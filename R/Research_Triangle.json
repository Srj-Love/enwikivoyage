[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Durham NorthCarolina Fountain Croasdaile Country Club.jpg"]]},"\nSprawling in the heart of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Carolina"]]},"'s Piedmont, the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Research Triangle"]}," is a metro area of about two million people. Largely suburban in nature, the Triangle is unique for a metro area in that, rather than having one primary city at its center, the region's focus is split between three cities: Raleigh, the state capital; Durham, a former industrial center, and Chapel Hill, a prominent college town.\n\nThe region derives its name from the major research universities in each of the Triangle's three cities as well as the vast office park that sits between these cities and is home to many research and high tech firms. These industries have spurred the rapid economic growth of the region. Visitors will find scenic college campuses, many of the state's cultural institutions, and a diverse population drawn by the Triangle's academic institutions and relatively high standard of living.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\nThe main three cities that make up the \"Triangle\" are:\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Chapel Hill"]]}," - A lovely college town based around the University of North Carolina, with college basketball, live music venues, and a beautiful campus."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Durham (North Carolina)"],["Durham"]]}," - Once the center of tobacco country, now home to Duke University, a vibrant arts scene, and a revitalizing downtown district."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Raleigh"]]}," - The state capital, with many of the state's cultural institutions."]},"\nIn addition, there are a few small towns around the region that have become suburbs of the metro area:\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Apex"]]}," - An expanding suburb near the Research Triangle Park."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Cary"]]}," - A sprawling, fast-growing suburb south of Raleigh."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Fuquay-Varina"]]}," - A town south of Raleigh, now a growing suburb."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Hillsborough (North Carolina)"],["Hillsborough"]]}," - A historic settlement west of Durham that's home to arts and music festivals."]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Zebulon"]]}," - A suburb located to the east of Raleigh."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.rdu.com\/ Raleigh-Durham International Airport"]}]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["RDU"]]},") is the main airport for the region, located at the center of the metro area near the Research Triangle Park, just off I-40.

Duke's campus is particularly scenic, with Gothic-style architecture (most notably a cathedral-like structure at the center of the west campus) and a fantastic public garden. UNC's main campus has plenty of colonial-style brick buildings surrounding a lush, tree-lined quad, with a lovely arboretum and a botanical garden also on campus.\n\nThere are also many prominent art and culture museums in the area.

Elsewhere in Raleigh is another state museum, the ",{"type":"'''","value":["NC Museum of Art"]},". In Durham, on the campus of Duke University, is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Nasher Museum of Art"]},", which plays host to some world-class art.

Non-college sports teams in the area include the popular ",{"type":"'''","value":["Durham Bulls"]}," minor league baseball team and Raleigh's ",{"type":"'''","value":["Carolina Hurricanes"]}," NHL hockey team.\n\nThere are many excellent performing arts spaces in the Triangle, hosting a lively theater scene. The lion's share of these are located in Durham, which is home to the prominent ",{"type":"'''","value":["Durham Performing Arts Center"]},", the historic ",{"type":"'''","value":["Carolina Theatre"]},", and a number of small, independent local theaters.
