With more than 720,000 hectares under protection, it is Mexico's largest intact tropical forest. \n\nIndigienous peoples who live in and around the reserve are involved in agriculture, raising cattle, forestry, and the harvest of chiclet gum.

Calakmul has a huge variety of species: around 250 species of trees, 500 species of butterflies, more than 30 species of amphibians, more than 100 species of reptiles, more than 280 species of birds, and more than 100 of mammals. Approximately half of these species are endangered or threatened to a degree that the require environmental protection.",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Calakmul bio reserve.jpg"],["thumb"],["Calakmul bio reserve"]]},"\n\nThe reserve is threatened by loss of habitat, loss of biodiversity, and population growth  in the region around the reserve. Other problems include illegal trafficking in tropical woods and forest resources, fires associated with agricultural activities, and introduction of invasive species. One of the biological consequences of Route 186 has been a tendency to interrupt genetic flow within the reserve, isolating populations north and south of the highway.
