Lesser served routes (ie. once per day) include Córdoba, Posadas and Rosario. There are numerous local buses to the neighbouring town of Corrientes and the National Park Chaco. The bus terminal is located outside the town center: Taxi rides between downtown and the bus terminal cost around 10 Argentinean Pesos.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Learn"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Work"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Fenix Cafe"]}," on Don Bosco and Guemes is fantastic, they served warm bread and creamed Roquefort before the meal and servered the best canalones and salsa mixto in Argentina!
