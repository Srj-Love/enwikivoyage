It is the centre of culture and life of the Icelandic people as well as being one of the focal points of tourism in Iceland. The city itself is spread out, with sprawling suburbs. The city centre, however, is a very small area characterised by eclectic and colourful houses, with good shopping, dining and drinking.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Reykjavik - old town and Tjornin.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["A part of Reykjavík's colourful old town. Tjörnin, with the city hall, is in the centre."]]},"\nWhen it started to develop as a town in the 18th century, Reykjavík had already been inhabited for almost a thousand years. Legend has it that the first permanent settler in Iceland was a Norwegian named Ingólfur Arnarson. He is said to have thrown his seat pillars into the sea en route to Iceland, and decided to settle wherever the pillars were found. The pillars washed up in Reykjavík, and so that was where he set up his farm.\n\nAlthough the story of Ingólfur Arnarson is not widely believed to be true by modern historians, it's clear that Reykjavík was one of the very first settlements in Iceland. Archaeological remains confirm that people were living there around the year 871, and for the first few centuries of Icelandic settlement Reykjavík was a large manor farm. Its fortunes steadily waned as other centres of power increased in importance. By the 18th century, the farm of Reykjavík was owned by the king of Denmark (under whose domain Iceland fell at the time). In 1752, the estate was donated to a firm, Innréttingarnar, led by Icelandic politician Skúli Magnússon. Innréttingarnar were meant to become an important industrial exporter and a source of development in Iceland, and their main base was in what is now the heart of Reykjavík. Although the company didn't achieve all its high ideals, it did lay the foundations of Reykjavík as it is today. In 1786, Reykjavík got a trading charter and it soon started to grow in importance.\n\nThe year 1801 is when Reykjavík went from being the largest town in the country, to its capital. That year a new supreme court, Landsyfirréttur, was set up in the city after the abolition of Alþingi (which no longer had any legislative functions). The same year the office of the Bishop of Iceland was founded in Reykjavík, merging the bishoprics of Hólar and Skálholt. In 1845, Alþingi was re-founded as an advisory council to the king on the affairs of Iceland, located in Reykjavík and in 1874 it regained legislative powers. As the sovereignty of the country grew, so too did Reykjavík, which by the beginning of the 20th century had been transformed from a small trading and fishing village to a fully fledged capital.\n\nThe Second World War was a boom era in Reykjavík. The city wasn't directly affected by the many horrors of the war, but the occupation of Iceland by first the UK and later the US provided increased employment opportunities and inflows of cash that enabled the rapid expansion and modernisation of the Icelandic fishing fleet. Reykjavík was a leader in this development and it grew very rapidly in the years following the war. New suburbs were built and the city started to reach across municipal limits, subsuming various surrounding communities. The city continued expanding until the financial collapse of 2008.\n\nDue to its young age, and in particular its rapid expansion in the late 20th century, Reykjavík is very different from the other Nordic capitals. It lacks their grand buildings and the picturesque old quarters. Instead it has come to resemble American cities with their sprawling suburbs and big motorways, as was recommended by the urban planners of the post-World War 2 era. Nevertheless Reykjavík has a charm of its own, quite unique, shaped by the dualistic nature of this place which still doesn't seem to have made up its mind on whether it's a small town or a big city.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh = 1.9"],["febhigh = 2.8"],["marhigh = 3.2"],["aprhigh = 5.7"],["mayhigh = 9.4"],["junhigh = 11.7"],["julhigh = 13.3"],["aughigh = 13.0"],["sephigh = 10.1"],["octhigh = 6.8"],["novhigh = 3.4"],["dechigh = 2.2"],["janlow = -3.0"],["feblow = -2.1"],["marlow = -2.0"],["aprlow = 0.4"],["maylow = 3.6"],["junlow = 6.7"],["jullow = 8.3"],["auglow = 7.9"],["seplow = 5.0"],["octlow = 2.2"],["novlow = -1.3"],["declow = -2.8"],["janprecip = 75.6"],["febprecip = 71.8"],["marprecip = 81.8"],["aprprecip = 51.3"],["mayprecip = 43.8"],["junprecip = 50.0"],["julprecip = 51.8"],["augprecip = 61.8"],["sepprecip = 66.5"],["octprecip = 85.6"],["novprecip = 72.5"],["decprecip = 78.7"],["description = Averages 1961-1990, data from the World Meteorological Organisation. \nUp to date weather information from the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/en.vedur.is\/ Icelandic Meteorological Office "]},"."]]},"\n\nThe weather in Reykjavík is notoriously unpredictable. One minute the sun may be shining on a nice summers day, the next it may change into a windy, rainy autumn. Temperatures in Reykjavík are quite bland: They don't go very high in the summer, nor do they go much below zero during winter. It follows that the differences between seasons are relatively small compared to what people experience on either side of the Atlantic.\n\nJanuary is the coldest month and usually has some snow, while there is frequently no snow on the ground during Christmas in December. Summer is without a doubt the favorite season of most Reykjavík inhabitants. Many of them seem to imagine their city is slightly warmer than it really is and it takes little to get them to start wearing shorts and t-shirts, or to go sunbathing in parks. Don't think too much about how silly it may seem, just join them in enjoying the season!\n\nWind is the main problem with the Reykjavík weather.

This fact is proven by the number of celebrities who come specifically for it.\n\nDrinking is expensive - expect to pay between 600 and 900 ISK for a draft pint at a bar. Bottled beers and mixed drinks are more expensive, sometimes outlandishly so. Despite the cost, going out in Reykjavik is a fun experience. Since alcohol is expensive at Reykjavík bars and clubs, Icelanders usually buy their alcohol at the government owned liquor stores (Vínbúðin, called Ríkið by locals) and stay at home drinking until about midnight (or later), then they will wander to the bars. Do not expect bars and clubs to become crowded during weekends until about 1AM (at least). Cover charges are very rare in Reykjavík, unless there is live music or some other sort of event going on. Note that although the legal age for entering clubs is 18, the legal drinking age is 20 and many places set higher entry age limits themselves.\n\nBars are open to 1AM on weeknights, but most will stay open until 6 or 7AM on Friday and Saturday. The clubs and bars themselves are mostly found in a very small area of the city centre, it's easy to just walk around and follow the crowds. You're sure to find somewhere to go, but if you're not sure, groups of drunken Icelanders will usually be eager to help a tourist out! During weekends, live music is easy to find in some of Reykjavík's bars. During the day, be sure to pick up a the free English-language magazine The ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/grapevine.is\/ Reykjavík Grapevine"]}," for information on live music events for that evening. It is easy to find in shops, restaurants and bars around the city.\n\nThere is an ice bar in Restaurant Reykjavík where all the furniture and the bar are made from glacial ice. This seems like an interesting place to go, however, as a warning, you will be charged 1300ISK for entry which includes a single vodka-based cocktail in what is effectively an atmosphere and music-free deep freezer.
