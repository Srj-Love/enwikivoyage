It was just a part of land that many people in the past had fought for. Reynosa was first noticed on 6 July 1686, a long exploring expedition was held by Mr. Agustin Echeverz  and Zuvízar, Governor of Nuevo Reino de León and is commanded by Captain Alonso, and they camped on the hills where Reynosa is located today. In December 1748, an expedition led by Colonel Jose de Escandon wanted to establish a new province plan to create 14 villages, including that of Reynosa. The convoy consisted of 1500 settlers and 755 soldiers. In September 1800, a flood occurred that literally swept people off the land; people were saved in canoes and rafts, taking refuge in the hills of El Morrillo. Then, later in 1802, the people in Reynosa relocated. By November 24, 1926, Reynosa is finally elevated back to the way the city was and prospering since.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Location"]},"\nReynosa is located at 26 º 05 'north latitude and 98 º 18' west longitude at an altitude of 38 meters above sea level.

It is said to be that in some parts of Mexico like Reynosa, they don't respect bicyclers or walkers that are on the street. That is why the choices for most people really narrow down to: drive, or take the bus. Of course many people risk their lives and still walk or bike in the streets,but majority does not. Despite all of the danger, Reynosa is a beautiful city to visit and Latinos enjoy it as is.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nThere are not that many historical things in Reynosa, Mexico to see. However, there are a few historical monuments like A Juárez, Hidalgo and Morelos. Also, there is an Architectural monument, Church of Our Lady of Guadalupe, which was built in 1810; it has a neoclassical style.\n\nAnother thing that tourists could look forward to are the popular festivities: Harvest Fair each year in August.
