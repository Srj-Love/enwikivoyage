Inhabited since Neolithic times, the island had important Bronze Age settlements, and at the dawn of the historical era was already famous for its three powerful cities of Lindos, Ialysos, and Kameiros, as mentioned in Homer.  In 408 bce these three cities joined to found the island's capital city, also called Rhodes.  Rhodes city and island played a vigorous role in subsequent ancient Greek and Roman history, its most memorable episode doubtless being the prolonged siege of the city by Demetrios Poliokertes in 305 bce.  In Hellenistic times Rhodes became extremely prosperous through trade and was one of the most influential cultural centers of the Greek world.  Later as a province of the Roman empire Rhodes' influence declined, though it was still an important regional capital and was one of the earliest centers of Christianity.  \n\nRhodes later became part of the Byzantine Empire and from the 7th century on fell under the general eclipse of the Dark Ages.  Later in the Middle Ages, Rhodes' importance again increased, as it came under the influence first of the Venetians, then of the Genoese, and finally of the Knights of Saint John, an organization of Crusaders who took over parts of Palestine but were later expelled by the Saracens and the Knights Templar and took refuge in Rhodes, wresting control of the island from the Genoese in 1306, ruling for two centuries, and building Rhodes once again into a major maritime power, until the island was conquered by Süleyman the Magnificent in 1523, becoming part of the Ottoman Empire.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Tourist information"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["The local tourist information office for the Dodecanese Islands"]}," is located in Rhodes city at Makariou & Papagou Corner (opposite the New Market). ☎ +30 2241 410 44335, +30 2241 410 44336, (",{"type":"''","value":["Fax +30 2241 026955"]},").\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Greek phrasebook"],["Greek"]]}," is the native language of the people of Rhodes.
