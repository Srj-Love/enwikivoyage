A central part of the region is occupied by a north-south line of well-defined mountainous massifs: from north to south, Bornes, Beauges, Chartreuse, Vercors, Baronies. These mountains are mainly made of limestone and are becoming a karst landscape.  Another, less prominent valley divides this central area from the eastern part of the region, the Alps proper, which contains some of Europe's highest mountains, such as Mont Blanc.  These mountains are made of acidic rocks such as granite.\n\nThe diverse climate of the Rhône-Alpes region is due to a blending of four weather influences: Mediterranean to the south, Alpine to the east, Continental to the north, and Atlantic to the west.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nThe easiest way for people traveling from abroad to arrive is through one of the major international airports in the region which include: ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.gva.ch\/ Cointrin International Airport in Geneva, Switzerland"]}]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["GVA"]]},"), ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.lyonairport.com\/ Bron International Airport in Lyon"]}]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["LYN"]]},"), and ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.grenoble-airport.com\/-SITE-PUBLIC-.html Grenoble Isère International Airport in Grenoble"]}]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["GNB"]]},").\n\nA host of smaller airports in towns like: ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Valence"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chambéry"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nEurope in general and France specifically has a wonderful network of high speed trains that can bring you into the region in a matter of hours from such far flung places as Belgium and Germany.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nAll the ski resorts of the region are connected by major highways and paved mountain roads, be sure to carry change though as the motor ways (denoted by A## are pay roads).
