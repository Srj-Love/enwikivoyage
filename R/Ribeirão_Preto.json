The city was laid by a stream called Black Creek, and was named after it. Eventually the farmers’ choice revealed itself as very adequate and the fertile soil of the Ribeirão Preto region allowed the highest crop productivity in Brazil.\nThe rapid development of the coffee cultivation brought wealth and progress to the city, which by the 1880s had become the largest coffee producer in the world. Coffee, the “green gold” as it was called, was responsible for a kind of “gold rush” in the region, which attracted workers and adventurous people from several parts of the world. This movement was helped by the new Mogiana Railway, which linked Ribeirão Preto to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["São Paulo"]]}," and to the port city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Santos"]]},", and by the abolition of slavery in Brazil, in 1888. The end of slavery created a strong demand for labor and the “coffee barons”, as the coffee farmers were called, stimulated European immigration - mostly from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Italy"]]}," but also from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Portugal"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Spain"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Germany"]]}," - to Ribeirão Preto. Later, after the stock market crash of 1929, several of these immigrants bought the farms from their indebted former employers. Ribeirão Preto underwent rapid growth during the 1980s and 90s due to a sugarcane boom, and now with a population of over 600,000 and a total metropolitan area of 1.4 million, it has become a lively and fun-loving city.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Dr. Leite Lopes Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["RAO"]]},") is about 18km from downtown."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Metropolitan Cathedral"],["url="],["email="],["address=Praça das Bandeiras - Centro"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=(16) 3625 0007"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Pedro II Theater"],["alt=Teatro Pedro II"],["url=http:\/\/www.ribeiraopreto.sp.gov.br\/fundacao\/teatro\/i36principal.php"],["email="],["address=Rua Álvares Cabral, 370"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Praça XV de Novembro"],["phone=(16) 3977 8111"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Mon-Fri 9AM-11AM, 3PM-5PM"],["price="],["content=Built in the boom years of the 1920's, this opera house is the third largest in Brazil and is home to the Ribeirão Preto Symphony Orchestra, one of the oldest in the country."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Seven Chapels"],["alt=Sete Capelas"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Museums"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=History of Coffee Museum"],["alt=Museu Histórico do Café"],["url="],["email="],["address=Av.
