It was settled in 1607 by an English settler named Capt. Christopher Newport and Capt. John Smith. The site was previously inhabited by the Powhatan Indians. It was named Richmond after the London suburb of Richmond-upon-Thames by its founder William Byrd II. The settlement did not become a city until 1742, and in the 135 years in between served as little more than a trading post for furs, hides, and tobacco. In 1782 Richmond became the state capital of Virginia. \n\nRichmond is one of the oldest American cities. The Shockoe Bottom entertainment area is where slave rebellion leader Gabriel had his head hung from a pike.  During the Civil War, it served as the capital of the Confederacy. When the Northern Army invaded Richmond, the fleeing Confederate government set fires to the city's munitions stores and government records they were unable to take with them. The fire grew out of control when winds picked up, and most of the city burned. The soldiers from the Union helped to put out the fires upon their arrival. The day after the city fell, Abraham Lincoln made a visit to the city. Though much of its colonial past has disappeared, it is rich in Civil War history and lore. There are, among other things, a Civil War prison site on Belle Isle, the house Robert E. Lee lived in, the state Capitol (which Thomas Jefferson designed and said was inspired by the Maison CarrÃ©e at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nimes"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["France"]]},") which served as the Confederate Capitol during the war, a museum of the Confederacy, the original Confederate White House, and Hollywood Cemetery in the heart of the city where more than 18,000 Confederate soldiers are laid to rest.

Muggings and purse snatchings, however, occur throughout the city, so be careful when walking or standing around at night.\n\nPopular night-spots around downtown, such as The Fan District, the areas around Virginia Commonwealth University and Shockoe Bottom can become dodgy at night, so it is best to avoid walking alone or on side streets. While all of the night spots are generally safe, it is also wise to avoid any confrontations inside or outside of nightclubs, especially in Shockoe Bottom, as incidents have sometimes lead to stabbings or shootings. This goes for fights between other people;  just go the other way.\n\nIn addition, much of the free and cheap parking in Shockoe Bottom is located under the freeway and train overpasses and have many dark areas; be aware of your surroundings when returning to your car after dark. As always, use common sense and avoid walking or parking in any areas that seem unsafe.\n\nMost areas of the city are also notorious for car break-ins, so it is always best to have nothing visible inside your car, including shoes, clothing or trash if you park on the street, in open lots, or in unsecured parking garages.\n\nAvoid swimming or wading in the James River within the city, as the currents and dropoffs are notorious for getting the best of even those most experienced with the river. If swimming, restrict yourself to public-access beaches or stretches of rocks such as Pony Pasture or Belle Isle's northern side, or avail yourself of local guidance. In addition, if on the riverbanks, be aware of weather conditions, as some areas around the riverfront are prone to flash-flooding.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=I-64.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["directionl1=W"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Charlottesville"]]}],["minorl1=Jct ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Farmville"],["S"]]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:US 15.svg"],["18px"]]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Culpeper"],["N"]]}],["directionr1=E"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Norfolk (Virginia)"],["Norfolk"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Williamsburg"]]}],["image2=I-95.svg"],["imagesize2=22"],["directionl2=N"],["majorl2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Washington, D.C."]]}],["minorl2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ashland (Virginia)"],["Ashland"]]}],["directionr2=S"],["majorr2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fayetteville (North Carolina)"],["Fayetteville"]]}],["minorr2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Petersburg (Virginia)"],["Petersburg"]]}],["image3=US 1.svg"],["imagesize3=22"],["directionl3=N"],["majorl3=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Washington, D.C."]]}],["minorl3=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ashland (Virginia)"],["Ashland"]]}],["directionr3=S"],["majorr3=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Raleigh"]]}],["minorr3=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Petersburg (Virginia)"],["Petersburg"]]}],["image4=US 33.svg"],["imagesize4=22"],["directionl4=W"],["majorl4=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Harrisonburg"]]}],["minorl4=Jct ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Farmville"],["S"]]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:US 15.svg"],["18px"]]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Culpeper"],["N"]]}],["directionr4=E"],["majorr4=END"],["minorr4="],["image5=US 60.svg"],["imagesize5=22"],["directionl5=W"],["majorl5=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amherst (Virginia)"],["Amherst"]]}],["minorl5=Jct ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Farmville"],["S"]]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:US 15.svg"],["18px"]]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Culpeper"],["N"]]}],["directionr5=E"],["majorr5=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Norfolk (Virginia)"],["Norfolk"]]}],["minorr5=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Williamsburg"]]}],["image6=US 301.svg"],["imagesize6=22"],["directionl6=N"],["majorl6=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Annapolis"]]}],["minorl6=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hanover (Virginia)"],["Hanover"]]}],["directionr6=S"],["majorr6=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fayetteville (North Carolina)"],["Fayetteville"]]}],["minorr6=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Petersburg (Virginia)"],["Petersburg"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usablecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Central Virginia"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["37.54213"],["-77.43336"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Richmond, Virginia"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North_America\/United_States\/Virginia\/Localities\/R\/Richmond\/"]]}]
