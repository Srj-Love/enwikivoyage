These regional segments of Richmond (75% of the city's area) are the reason behind its horrible reputation, ranking with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Compton"]]}," as the worst cities in California statiscally when it comes to crime rate.  Travelers that must traverse these parts of town should know their way around and stay on the major thoroughfares through here, such as MacDonald Avenue, 23rd Street or Cutting Boulevard, without stopping here for anything or any reason.
