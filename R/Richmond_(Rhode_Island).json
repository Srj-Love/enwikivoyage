It is bordered to the north by the town of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Exeter (Rhode_Island)"],["Exeter"]]},", to the west by the village of Wood River and to the south by the Pawcatuck River.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nRichmond was incorporated as a town by the General Assembly of Rhode Island on August 18, 1747. The name of the town is said to derive from that of Edward Richmond, the state's colonial attorney general from 1677 to 1680. Tradition holds that the first settlers of Richmond were a married couple, John Babcock and Mary Lawson, whose son James was the first non-Native American child born in Narragansett territory. (The story is likely a later invention.)\n\nRichmond's economy was based on textile manufacturing from the mid-1800s through the 1960s. Today the town serves mainly as a bedroom community for commuters working in Providence, Warwick and eastern Connecticut.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nInterstate 95 passes through town.  Get off 95 at exit 3A or exit 3B (Hope Valley \/ South Kingstown exit).  Either offramp will put you on RI 138.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nRichmond is a small town not easily traveled without motor vehicle.  The small town of Richmond contains several villages, including: Arcadia, Alton, Carolina, Hope Valley, Kenyon, Shannock, Usquepaug, Woodville and Wyoming.\n\nThere is a park n' ride across from the McDonalds on Rt. 138, and right off of 95, which RIPTA ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ripta.com"]}," operates.\n\nThe Three main roads that lead through Richmond are Rt. 138, Rt. 3 and Rt. 112.  Following 138 with either lead you west into Hopkinton or east to route 1 and South Kingstown.  Route 3 will bring you into Exeter and West Greenwich.

Route 95 is the easiest way to get around, and the main highway for the area.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nMuch of Richmond is still untouched by development.  Indeed, Richmond is one of the last few enclaves that perpetuate the simple pleasures of Rhode Island.\n\nThere are many ponds and rivers where the nature enthusiast can enjoy fishing or kayaking.\n\nThe Charlestown Fish Pond, a hidden treasure, is buried in the woods but still attracts up to 100 visitors at the start of every season.\n\nCrawly Preserve, a nature retreat, is located in Richmond.\n\nThe North-South Trail runs through Richmond, with marked trails. It is a hike that can be as long or as short as you desire.\n\nArcadia Management Area is a nice place for bike rides, hikes, walking dogs, kayaking, hunting, and fishing. The small rivers and ponds throughout the area are stocked with trout every spring. Arcadia consists of 14,000 acres with cleared trails and a few different large ponds, the largest being Break Heart Pond.  It is an undeniably beautiful area and a perfect retreat for outdoorsy people.\n\nCarolina Management Area is also a nice place to enjoy the outdoors. It consists of 2,359 acres of public property. The main access is located on the left hand side heading west on Pine Hill Road. It can be most easily accessed from Rt 112, which is the main road that goes through the tiny hamlet of Carolina. This area has cut trails as well as a portion of the North-South trail going through the management area. Recreational activities include hiking, bird watching, hunting and fishing during the legal seasons (details can be obtained from the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.dem.ri.gov\/programs\/bnatres\/fishwild\/ RI DEM"]}," website), horse back riding, and cross country skiing in the winter. (Camping is not permitted in any season, however.) RI 91 runs along the back side of the Management Area, with several unmarked accesses. There are fields, swamplands, and stands of pine that you can hike through.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nThe ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.richmondri.com Town Hall Website"]}," is up-to-date on the latest events and goings-on in town.\n\nIf you like to golf there are a number of fine courses nearby, including: ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.beaverrivergolf.com\/ Beaver River Golf Course"]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.richmondcountryclub.net\/Club\/Scripts\/Home\/home.asp Richmond Country Club"]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.fennerhill.com\/ Fenner Hill Golf Club"]},", ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.golflink.com\/golf-courses\/course.aspx?course=1731856 Pinehurt Golf Course"]}," and ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.woodrivergolf.com\/ Wood River Golf Club"]},".\n\nDuring the month of August, Richmond holds the annual and much anticipated Washington County Fair.  For a week many gather to listen to music, watch racing lawnmowers, and to play carnival games.  The Washington County Fair is Richmond's biggest event, followed by the lively Farmers' Market in front of the town hall.\n\nWith an abundance of rivers and streams, there are also plenty of good fishing spots in and around town.  Supplies can be bought at the local bait and tackle shop in Hope Valley, a mile or so down Route 138 from the Town Hall.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Washington County
