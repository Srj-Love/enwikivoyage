The coastal line was situated through Rijswijk at 3700BC, but gradually moved west over time. The oldest traces of inhabitants date back to 3500BC; in the new stone age. The 'Oude Kerk' (translated as 'Old Church') has played a part in the coming to be of the current village centre. Around 1200AD the Oude Kerk was built on a Roman predecessor. Around 1500AD the current church, which is still present, came to be. The village pump was built in 1831. Until then a bucked was used to get water from the old city well.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Not."]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" A stop Train goes twice every hour between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rotterdam"]]}," (Centraal) and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Den Haag"]]}," (Centraal), stopping at Rijswijk (among others)."]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By tram or bus"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Regional busses from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Delft"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rotterdam"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Den Haag"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["municipality Westland"]]}," stop in Rijswijk."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Busses from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Den Haag"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Delft"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Leidschendam-Voorburg"]]}," stop in Rijswijk (lines 18 and 23)."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Trams from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Den Haag"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Delft"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Leidschendam-Voorburg"]]}," stop in Rijswijk (lines 1, 10, 15 and 17)."]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The township Rijswijk is reachable from highways:"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":[" A4 (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amsterdam"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Leiden"]]}," (direction South) en ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Delft"]]}," (direction North))"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"*","value":[" A13 (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Delft"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rotterdam"]]}," (direction north)).
