Evidence has displayed that the region may have been inhabited as many as 11,000 years ago.  The first modern settler was Abel Platts, who arrived in 1738.  The onset of the French and Indian War in 1744 drove the majority of the initial settlers away, but only for a short time.  Platts and an small group of settlers returned to establish a more permanent residence in 1758 after the war had subsided.  By 1859, there was 1,200 residents living in the small mill town.  Rindge has only grown slightly over the years with modern census figures displaying slightly more than 6,000 current residents.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" From Keene, NH: Take NH-12S to NH-119E into Rindge.
