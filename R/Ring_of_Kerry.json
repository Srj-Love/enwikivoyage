There are relatively few historic sites along the route, though those that are there are worth seeing.  Unfortunately, with fame comes the masses, and there are dozens of tour buses that run this route every day. This is good news if you don't have a car or a bike, but bad news if you do.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Route"]},"\nAll the tour buses run counter clockwise, as in many places there is no way two could pass each other. If biking, it's best to go around clockwise, so that you meet tour buses head on. For driving, this depends on your vehicle size: go clockwise so that you don't spend hours seeing nothing but a giant coach rear end; or counter clockwise if driving a large vehicle and don't want to risk encountering a coach at a narrow section.\n\nThough officially the Ring Of Kerry is a 179 km horseshoe around the Iveragh Peninsula, for the purpose of this itinerary the 214 km loop from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Killarney"]]}," will be used. For those on bike, the Kerry Way trail passes through most of the same sights, though it doesn't extend all the way to the end of the peninsula.  If going by car, a minimum of two days is recommended, but that leaves no time for side trips, so, like almost everywhere, the longer you take, the more you'll enjoy it.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Killarney to Kenmare"]},"\nStarting in Killarney , head south on the N71.
