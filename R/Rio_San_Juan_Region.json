If you wish to go beyond El Castillo you'll need to go on occasional public boats that go all the way to the end of the river at San Juan del Norte. It takes 3 hours for most public boats to travel between El Castillo and San Carlos; occasional speedboats go (generally early in the morning) which halve the travel time.\n\nThere are no roads to speak of in this area of Nicaragua; all significant transport between San Carlos and San Juan del Norte is by boat.

For the most adventurer there is the possibility to canoe o kayak all the way to San Juan del Norte, a 4 or 5 day trip, about 160 km down river, you must bring your camping gear, guide trip are expensive, but if you have experience and are in good shape, this could be the adventure of a life time.\n\nIf you like fishing, go give it a try to capture a giant Tarpon, weighing an average of 140 plus pounds, for this you must rent a boat, or pang.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nA particular specialty in this area are the so-called giant river shrimp, or \"camarones del rio\".

The normal caution should apply and taking taxis at night in San Carlos when going home from the bars and discotheques is certainly advisable.\n\nIn the Rio San Juan (as well as in lake Cocibolca) there are some bull sharks (yes seriously!) that are known to have attacked humans. As their numbers are very low humans are probably a bigger danger to them than the other way around, but the possibility of an attack exists.\n\nMalaria and especially Dengue are more likely along the Rio San Juan than in more urbanized parts of the country. Dengue is transmitted by a type of mosquito that is only active during the day whereas the Malaria-mosquito is active during dusk and dawn but also at night. Doctors usually do not advise to take any medication against Malaria before the occurrence of symptoms and the Nicaraguan strain is comparatively harmless but precautions against mosquitoes (clothing that covers as much skin as possible, DEET-containing repellents (widely available, called \"repelente\" in Spanish)and mosquito nets (mosquitero in Spanish)) are certainly a good idea.\n\nWhen hiking through remote areas guides are always a good idea as getting lost is less fun than having somebody who can explain plants and wildlife to you.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Costa Rica"]]}," (only possible at the border crossing by river from San Carlos)\n\nOmetepe (by boat from San Carlos)\n\nBluefields (by boat from San Juan del Norte)\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Nicaragua"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:RÃ­o San Juan Department"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["11.309722222222"],["-84.696666666667"]]}]
