Highway 160 is a wonderful drive if you can handle its narrow lanes, and offers a scenic view of many delta waterways as it follows their winding paths all the way from Sacramento in the North to Antioch in the South. Turning from HWY 160 onto HWY 12 West, drivers will pass over the Rio Vista Bridge, an iconic draw bridge admired by Rio Vistans as one of their most renowned monuments. Entering from HWY 12 East coming from Fairfield, one must drive very carefully, as this is one of the deadliest roads in all of California.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nRio Vista Municipal Airport\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nAlthough the Rio Vista City Council has recently brought great improvements to the bus lines running through Rio Vista, it is much easier to walk.
