It is the official birthplace of the Republican Party in the United States, and was a hot bed of idealistic thought in the 19th Century. The nearby settlement of Ceresco was a communal experiment that ultimately failed, leading to Ceresco being absorbed by the town of Ripon in 1851. Unsurprisingly, Ripon was a strongly abolitionist enclave.\n\nThese days, Ripon hosts both Ripon College and the Little White Schoolhouse, the latter of which is the exact place where the Republican Party was created.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nRipon is fortunate in that it is quite close to the city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oshkosh"]]},".

The decor changes depending on which side of the restaurant one is on; towards the back it is decidedly Chinese in flavor, with dragons and a small indoor waterfall that flows into a fish-filled pool. Towards the front is a somewhat more traditionally styled bar with a mural of various Republican presidents up to and including Eisenhower.
