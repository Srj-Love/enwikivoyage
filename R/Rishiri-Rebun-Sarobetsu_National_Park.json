It consists of two islands, Rishiri-to (利尻島) and Rebun-to (礼文島), and an adjacent section of coastline on Hokkaido itself, known as the Wakasakanai Coast (稚咲内海岸).  The two islands are the main attraction of the area, featuring native wildflowers, spectacular landscapes and fantastic hiking for both experienced and beginner hikers.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nRishiri-to is a small island off the north-west coast of Hokkaido made up of a single volcano called Rishiri-san (利尻山) which towers some 1719m over the surrounding sea. It can be seen from over 100km away.\n\nRebun-to is the smaller of the two with its highest peak, Rebun-dake (礼文岳) a mere 490m (and thus much easier to climb). The island has many wildflowers and some waterfalls, and the view of Rishiri-to from it is nothing short of spectacular.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nThese islands belonged to the Ainu until the recent migration of the Japanese to Hokkaido.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nHeavy snow in winter.

There are hiking trails on both islands that really let you explore the best parts of the islands, and it may be desirable to take buses or taxis to the trailheads.

Starting from Oshidomari in the north, walk, bus, or taxi to the Rishiri Hokuroku-yaei-jo campground.  If you start after 9:00, the campground workers will give you a map and ask you to sign their hiking book.  After several hundred yards, you reach the Kanronsen Spring.  This is your last chance to get water, so get a lot (perhaps 3 liters).  The trail gradually winds its way upward.  There are a few outhouses along the way, and also an unmanned emergency-use cabin.  Closer to the top, the trees get smaller and you walk up an exposed ridgeline.  In the sun, this section gets hot and dry.  In bad weather this section could be very dangerous, so bring appropriate gear and go down if the weather gets bad.  Several minutes below the peak, the western trail forks off to the side.
