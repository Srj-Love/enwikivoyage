[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Risoul"]}," is a commune and skiresort in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hautes-Alpes"]]}," department. It's located in the French Alps, in the southeastern part of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["France"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nAlthough popular with hikers in other seasons, Risoul's main tourist attraction are its ski and snowboard opportunities in winter. Together with the nearby village of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vars"]]},", Risoul forms a fairly large ski domain called ",{"type":"''","value":["Forêt Blanche"]},", which boasts 113 slopes with a total length of 185 km.\n\nThe crowd is relatively young, with many students but also a large number of families with children. The resort has a number of nightlife options and plenty of facilities for children, both in terms of skiing\/snowboarding and animation.\n\nNote that the ski resort (sometimes referred to as Risoul 1850, after its height, or Risoul Station), is located about 12 km from the old village of Risoul.\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nDue to its fairly remote location and limited access by road, Risoul isn't the most easily reachable ski resort (which was one of the main reasons of the 1974 bankruptcy). It's a few hours drive from all the nearest international airports, being ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Turin"]]}," (2,5 hours), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Grenoble"]]},", Chambéry and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Marseille"]]}," (all just over 3 hours).\n\nMany visitors come by car. From the direction of Marseille, Risoul is accessible through the A51 and N94. From the direction of Grenoble, it's either the N85 or the N91, again followed by the N94.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe station itself is not very big, and especially when you're not carrying your ski or snowboard gear, it's fairly easy to make your way on foot. Of course, remember that stairs and pavements can get icy so make sure to bring proper footwear.\n\nDuring the winter sports season and during French holidays, free taxi buses run approximately hourly between the village and the station. Another free minibus circulates the station, allowing those who are staying in accommodations somewhat further from the pistes to get there and back without extensive walks.

Upon arrival you'll probably be handed a map of the station, with the different shops marked on it. If not, pick it up at the tourist office or SARA registration office (right when entering the village).\nVirtually everything can be found in the buildings facing the \"front de la neige\" (the main starting place, where the lifts are) or in the streets directly behind. There are two SPAR supermarkets (one under de Melezes residence, the other at the Rue de la Forêt Blanche.) Almentation Andrieux Proxi (in the same street) has a comparable selection. There are two butchers, several bakeries (most open only until late in the morning, though) and some local delicatessen stores. The pharmacy is located right in the centre.\n\nOff course, sports stores are plentiful, offering all kinds of sports gear, clothing and accessories. Most aren't super cheap, so if you're traveling on a budget it probably better to buy your gear beforehand. \n\nSeveral souvenir stores sell postcards, but most don't sell stamps. For stamps, head to the post office which is also just on Rue de la Forêt Blanche.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nRisoul's ski resort has over 18,500 beds, divided over hotel rooms, chalets and many 2, 3 or 4 star apartments. A large number of beds, some 6000 in total, are run by SARA. Pay attention to the location of your accommodation. Some are conveniently located right next to the slopes, at a stone's throw of the lifts, while others will require a walk. If you're a light sleeper, take into account that accommodations above bars and disco's may come with late night noises.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Hautes-Alpes"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Risoul"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["44.64972"],["6.64083"]]}]
