Thanks to surf and eco-tourism in the area, large developments like Rancho Santana have land-grabbing expats and entrepreneurs excited. The many surf camps and smaller resorts attract a variety of travelers world-wide. This surge can be attributed to the many articles that have been published in recent years in surfing magazines and lifestyle magazines like GQ, and the fact that Costa Rica's once untamed coasts have been developed to the point of exhaustion.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\nwww.rivasspanishschool.com\n\nspanishschoolrivas@gmail.com\n\nwww.nicaraguaspanishlanguage.com\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Rivas,_Nicaragua"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["11.4333"],["-85.8333"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Southern_Pacific_Coast_(Nicaragua)"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]}]
