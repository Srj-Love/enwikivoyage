Riverside was known as \"The Coney Island of New England\" because of a major amusement park called Crescent Park. Crescent park was built in 1886 by Charles Boyden. The park contained ballrooms, a carousel, many amusement rides, hotels, and restaurants. There was a steamship that traveled to many other parks in the area. In 1979 Crescent Park was torn down. The only thing that was left was the Carousel.
