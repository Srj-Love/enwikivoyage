Dating from the 10th century a.d.  it is a quaint place with relatively little to see, but due to its location on the main railway line from London to Hastings and the corresponding main road (A21), it represents a good potential base to discover the picturesque local countryside, sights, towns and villages nearby.

They are very friendly and welcoming people, and a number of public footpaths run through their land. They also produce and sell wooden carved toys and furniture.\n\nThe famous ",{"type":"'''","value":["cricket"]}," brand Gray Nicolls (the Nicolls part) was founded in Robertsbridge, and operates from its original location on station road to this day, making (among other things) handmade cricket bats.\n\nAlso the Kent and East Sussex railway ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.kesr.org.uk\/"]}," finds its most westerly extension at Robertsbridge station. This ",{"type":"'''","value":["Steam locomotive"]}," company operates between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tenterden"]]}," and Bodiam, and the line is awaiting connection to the existent line at Robertsbridge, over the A21 main road. As of 2012, enough funding has become available to do so and the focus has shifted onto receiving planning permission. A small collection of Steam trains and carriages are kept at Robertsbridge station and operated occasionally on the short track up to the A21.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe nearest major airport is ",{"type":"'''","value":["London Gatwick"]},", roughly an hour and a half away by road or rail.
