A new castle was built on a hill near the site on which the castle now stands after the Norman invasion of 1066. This would have been a wooden motte and bailey type castle. In 1088 the castle came under attack in the conflict between William Rufus and Odo, Bishop of Bayeux. After William the Conqueror died in 1087 Normandy was split. Odo along with many others supported William's elder brother Robert, Duke of Normandy rather than William Rufus, the Conqueror's younger brother. Odo had control of the castle and it became the headquarters for the rebels. The castle fell to Rufus' army and Odo was forced into exile. Gundulf, the bishop of Rochester, orchestrated the creation of a stone castle alongside the cathedral. Over the centuries the castle was the scene for many conflicts including King John's attempt to regain to castle from rebellious Barons and, in 1264, Simon de Montfort's rebellion.\n:By the 17th century, the castle had become neglected, the keep had been burned out, and the site was being used as a local quarry for building materials. In 1870 the castle grounds were leased to the City of Rochester, who turned them into a public park and eventually, in the 20th century, responsibility for this imposing old structure was taken over by English Heritage. Today, the castle stands as a proud reminder of the history surrounding the old town of Rochester, along with the cathedral, the cobbled streets and the Dickensian reflections.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Upnor Castle"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.english-heritage.org.uk\/daysout\/properties\/upnor-castle\/"],["email="],["address=High Street, Upnor, ME2 4XG"],["lat=51.40690"],["long=0.52709"],["directions="],["phone=+44 1634 718742"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=adults £5.80, children £3.70, concessions £3.70"],["content="]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Eastgate House Garden"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address=High St."],["lat=51.38726"],["long=0.50646"],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Eastgate House was built in late 16th century.
