The birthplace of amateur photography, Rochester has long been known as Kodak Town, but its fame was established well before George Eastman came on the scene. Today, its historical treasures complement modern family-friendly attractions that rival those found in much larger communities.\n\nIn Rochester, you can find the only museum in the world dedicated to play; award-winning music, dance, and acting ensembles; a dense festival calendar covering nearly every weekend of the year; minor-league sports of the highest caliber; and a trio of majestic waterfalls right in the middle of the city. The gateway to the scenic and culinary delights of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New York (state)"],["New York"]]},"'s ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Finger Lakes"]]}," region, Rochester is the perfect place to begin your exploration of Western New York.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nRochester, known as ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Flower City"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["The World's Image Centre"]},", is the third-largest city in the state of New York, after ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New York City"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Buffalo (New York)"],["Buffalo"]]},". ",{"type":"'''","value":["Lake Ontario"]}," lies to its north, with the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Genesee River"]}," flowing northward through the city and over a set of three waterfalls.  The historic ",{"type":"'''","value":["Erie Canal"]}," also runs along the city's borders.\n\nBut Rochester is much more than just its waterways.  The city loves to celebrate its long history of ",{"type":"'''","value":["industry and invention"]},", taking pride in the many innovators and social reformers that have made their marks here.  It also looks to the future, to the new places to which today's innovations will lead.  And when it's time to relax, few cities of its size can compare in the variety and quality of cultural and recreational events available here.\n\nAbove all, the city's primary trait may be ",{"type":"'''","value":["perseverance"]},".  Epitomized by the yearly collective slog through another snowy winter, this perseverance also manifests itself in the way Rochester has reinvented itself over the years.  Even today, as the city tries to chart its course through the 21st century, its people plunge forward with that same determination, carrying with them not just the hope, but the certainty that springtime will arrive and with it, growth.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nRochester has always been defined by water.  It was born in the early nineteenth century as a small village on the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Genesee River"]},", a few miles south of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Lake Ontario"]},".  The village was constructed around flour mills that took advantage of the three waterfalls on the river for power.  When the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Erie Canal"]}," was built a few years later, it was routed through Rochester, and the small village became ",{"type":"'''","value":["America's first boomtown"]},", a major trade center for grain being shipped east and goods being shipped west.  It soon garnered the nickname \"",{"type":"'''","value":["The Flour City"]},"\", and its products were known as far away as England.\n\nAs time went on, and farmland opened up in the Great Plains, Rochester's flour industry faded, to be replaced by a variety of others, including clothing, shoes, boats, and horticulture.  By the middle of the nineteenth century, Rochester's nurseries and gardens had led to a new nickname: \"",{"type":"'''","value":["The Flower City"]},"\", celebrated each year with the famous ",{"type":"'''","value":["Lilac Festival"]}," each May.  Rochester also became a center for social progressivism.  The great abolitionist orator ",{"type":"'''","value":["Frederick Douglass"]}," made his home here for many years, and suffragist ",{"type":"'''","value":["Susan B. Anthony"]}," was a lifelong resident.\n\nIn the early 1900s, the modern city began to take shape, molded in large part by the philanthropy of ",{"type":"'''","value":["George Eastman"]},", whose Eastman Kodak camera company became the area's largest employer.  The Eastman School of Music, the Eastman Theatre, the George Eastman House, and numerous other buildings and institutions remain today as testaments to his influence and generosity.\n\nSince World War II, Rochester has seen a decline in population but has also seen periods of urban renewal funded by industry.  In the 60s and 70s, the city became known as the leading ",{"type":"'''","value":["jazz"]}," town in upstate New York, a legacy recalled today by the annual ",{"type":"'''","value":["Rochester International Jazz Festival"]}," in June.  Since the turn of the century, Rochester has called itself \"",{"type":"'''","value":["The World's Image Centre"]},"\", based on the local prominence of imaging giants Kodak and Xerox and optics company Bausch & Lomb.\n\nRochester's recent industrial decline has been painful, but it has been countered by a rise in world-class historical and cultural attractions.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Imperial"],["janhigh = 31"],["febhigh = 33"],["marhigh = 43"],["aprhigh = 55"],["mayhigh = 68"],["junhigh = 77"],["julhigh = 81"],["aughigh = 79"],["sephigh = 71"],["octhigh = 60"],["novhigh = 47"],["dechigh = 36"],["janlow = 17"],["feblow = 17"],["marlow = 25"],["aprlow = 35"],["maylow = 46"],["junlow = 55"],["jullow = 60"],["auglow = 59"],["seplow = 51"],["octlow = 41"],["novlow = 33"],["declow = 23"],["janprecip = 2.3"],["febprecip = 2.0"],["marprecip = 2.6"],["aprprecip = 2.8"],["mayprecip = 2.8"],["junprecip = 3.4"],["julprecip = 2.9"],["augprecip = 3.5"],["sepprecip = 3.5"],["octprecip = 2.6"],["novprecip = 2.8"],["decprecip = 2.7"],["jansun =  9"],["febsun = 11"],["marsun = 12"],["aprsun = 13"],["maysun = 15"],["junsun = 15"],["julsun = 15"],["augsun = 14"],["sepsun = 12"],["octsun = 11"],["novsun = 10"],["decsun =  9"],["janh2o = 38"],["febh2o = 36"],["marh2o = 36"],["aprh2o = 38"],["mayh2o = 44"],["junh2o = 56"],["julh2o = 67"],["augh2o = 70"],["seph2o = 66"],["octh2o = 56"],["novh2o = 48"],["dech2o = 41"],["description = ",{"type":"{{","value":[["forecastNOAA"],["Rochester"],["43.15"],["-77.61"]]}]]},"\n\nRochester is unashamedly part of the Snow Belt of the United States, competing every year with its upstate neighbors for the \"coveted\" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Golden Snowball Award"]}," (for most snowfall).

Rochester has one of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["highest populations of deaf people"]}," (per capita) in the United States, and as such sign language is not an uncommon sight around the city.  It's not a given that you'll see ASL being used if you visit Rochester—unless you drop by the Rochester School for the Deaf, or the National Technical Institute for the Deaf at Rochester Institute of Technology—but you never know.\n\nFor deaf people, few cities in the world are as accommodating as Rochester.  Most businesses, especially in Henrietta and Brighton, are accustomed to working with deaf customers and often have teletype machines and dedicated TTY phone numbers.  Open-captioned films are regularly shown at the local multiplexes (in particular, at Regal Henrietta), and many major events will be interpreted.  At RIT, nearly all events have ",{"type":"''","value":["both"]}," captioning and interpreters.  Wherever the event is held, a quick phone call is often all that is needed to ensure the presence of an interpreter.\n\nIf you encounter a deaf person but don't know sign language, do not shout.  You can raise your voice ",{"type":"''","value":["slightly"]},", but it's most important to speak clearly and directly, being careful not to hide your mouth with your hand.  If all else fails, find a piece of paper and write back and forth.  If an interpreter is available, be sure to address the deaf person, not the interpreter.  The deaf person will watch the interpreter, but you should be looking at the deaf person and listening to the interpreter.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Map - Rochester NY Airport.png"],["thumb"],["350px"],["Greater Rochester International Airport and vicinity."]]},"\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ROCairport.com Greater Rochester International Airport"]}]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["ROC"]]},"), 1200 Brooks Ave (",{"type":"''","value":["I-390 to Exit 18B or I-490 to Exit 6; follow signs"]},"), is located just southwest of the city proper, six miles southwest of downtown.  It is a very nice medium-sized airport, newly remodeled in 2008, with three runways and two concourses.  The airline with the most passengers is US Airways, but most of the major domestic carriers and low-cost airlines JetBlue and Southwest have multiple daily scheduled flights to and from their hubs.  Flights are also available to and from fellow upstate cities ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Buffalo (New York)"],["Buffalo"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Syracuse (New York)"],["Syracuse"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Albany (New York)"],["Albany"]]},", as well as seasonal direct flights to and from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Orlando"]]},".

Most of the common car rental agencies have a presence here, and this is the only place in the city you can reliably find a taxi to hire.  Bus service on RTS is available, but not particularly convenient—routes 2 and 4 serve the airport, but they only go to the RTS hub downtown.  The other option is a hotel shuttle; many of the hotels on the west side of the city offer complimentary airport shuttles.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nBecause of Rochester's location close to Lake Ontario, the ",{"type":"'''","value":["New York State Thruway"]},", Interstate 90, passes a few miles to the south, through the southern suburbs.

Most also have locations scattered throughout the city and surrounding towns, and they will usually come pick you up if you're coming in from, say, the Amtrak station.  Contact your preferred agency for details and locations.\n\nThose who balk at needing a car to get anywhere in the Rochester area can at least take heart that it is a very drivable city.  A common local maxim is that the travel time between any two points in or around the city is twenty minutes.  The expressway system was designed in the 50s, when Rochester's population was booming; this growth slowed to a stop soon afterward, leaving a network of high-capacity roads that rarely see congestion.  You'll encounter some mild rush-hour slowdowns, especially on Interstates 390, 490, and 590, but visitors from more populous areas will scoff at what Rochesterians call \"traffic\".\n\nConstruction and severe winter weather can disrupt Rochester's normally placid roads, however.  In winter, pay close attention to traffic advisories, and if they say \"no unnecessary travel\"—they ",{"type":"''","value":["mean"]}," it.  Most of the time, though, drive slowly and carefully and you'll be fine.  It takes locals a snowfall or two to remember this every November, so be extra-cautious early in the season.\n\nOutside of downtown, any place you want to go will have its own parking lot of some sort.  Downtown, you'll find a mix of dedicated lots, street parking, public lots, and parking garages.  Most surface lots are $5\/day or thereabouts, with higher prices near the Blue Cross Arena on game\/concert nights.  The garages are generally priced reasonably as well.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Expressways"]},"\n\nThe highway system is designed as two loops, the unofficial ",{"type":"'''","value":["\"Outer Loop\""]}," and the official ",{"type":"'''","value":["\"Inner Loop\""]},", with feeders coming in from the west, east, and south.  (North is Lake Ontario—no highways there!)  The Inner Loop is an urban expressway, weaving both above and below the surface roads of downtown.  It circumscribes the nominal downtown area, although some \"downtown\" attractions—Frontier Field, High Falls, and most of the museums, for example—lie outside the Inner Loop.  Because it's a loop, you can get turned around if you're not familiar with the area; visitors should probably stick to surface streets.\n\nThe Inner Loop begins and ends at ",{"type":"'''","value":["I-490"]},", which runs east-west right through the middle of the city and forms the bottom portion of the actual loop.  I-490 is the feeder expressway that connects the Outer and Inner Loops on both the east and west sides of the city, eventually connecting up with Interstate 90, the New York State Thruway, on both ends (several miles out).\n\nThe Outer Loop runs very close to the official city limits.  ",{"type":"'''","value":["I-390"]}," comes up from the south (where it connects with the Thruway), then turns sharply west at a junction with ",{"type":"'''","value":["I-590"]},", which heads east.  The two spurs curve out and up to the north to form the bottom part of the loop, until they each reach I-490 on either side of the city.  Their Interstate designations end there, but the highways each continue north as State Routes 390 and 590.  390 passes State Route 104 and continues north as an expressway to the Lake Ontario State Parkway, just west of the Rochester harbor.  590 also passes Route 104, but soon becomes a surface road for the rest of its run to the lake, at Seabreeze near Irondequoit Bay.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["New York State Route 104"]}," is a major east-west route and forms the northern part of the Outer Loop, although it's only an expressway on one side, from the river east.  It's also the main feeder route from the northeast and northwest.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Surface roads"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Rochester downtown orientation sign.png"],["thumb"],["While driving downtown, keep an eye out for these directional signs; they're color-coded by quadrant and provide directions to parking and attractions."]]},"\n\nThe expressways will get you close to your destination, but navigating the surface streets is necessary as well.  Rochester's early founding as a milling village means that its major avenues were laid out to facilitate traffic to outlying and neighboring settlements—namely, in a radiating pattern.  In general, \"avenues\" radiate outward from downtown and \"streets\" connect the avenues, but this is not set in stone and there are almost as many exceptions as there are examples.\n\nThe only place it's really tricky to drive is downtown.  There is a small selection of one-way streets, just few enough to confuse you when you encounter one.  There are also some turning restrictions on weekdays, especially for turning onto Main Street; watch the signs carefully.  Outside of downtown, you shouldn't have any problem navigating the surface streets.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nThe area bus system is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Regional Transit Service"]}," (",{"type":"'''","value":["RTS"]},"), run by the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.rgrta.com\/ Rochester Genesee Regional Transportation Authority"]}," (RGRTA).  While the buses are clean, efficient, comfortable, and cheap, the service has often been criticized as inconvenient.\n\nThe bus routes are designed as a hub-spoke system, optimized for travelers headed to and from downtown.  The hub is downtown, so travelers trying to get from one suburb to another often have to ride one bus all the way into the city, then another all the way back out.  The system works great for getting to the center of downtown, but the typical rider will be faced with a walk or another bus ride to get the rest of the way to his or her destination.\n\nIf the bus routes are convenient for you, though, RTS service is hard to beat, especially when the roads get slushy in winter.  Every RTS bus has a bicycle rack on front, which can provide some flexibility if you're willing to bike to a bus stop.  Fares are $1.00 per ride, or $3.00 for an all-day pass.  $14.00 gets you a 5-day pass and $56.00 allows you to ride freely for a full month.  Discounted fares are available for children and seniors (although you'll need a Medicare or RTS low-fare card for the senior discount). The $1.00 fare is valid for an hour so you can change buses without paying again; be sure to ask the driver for a transfer ticket.\n\nBus schedules are available ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.rgrta.org\/SchedulesMaps\/Schedules.aspx?RTS online"]}," and throughout the city, especially at transit hubs and information centers.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By foot"]},"\n\nDowntown Rochester is very walkable, at least for eight months out of the year.  Traffic is light outside of rush hours, and crosswalks are plentiful.  The Rochester ",{"type":"'''","value":["Skyway"]}," is a system of enclosed elevated walkways and underground tunnels that connect numerous buildings downtown, including hotels, office buildings, and parking garages.  It's especially useful in the winter, but the network only covers the east side of the river, and its continuity was severely disrupted by the recent closing of Midtown Plaza.  Still, it provides a relatively warm, traffic-free route around the area.

It also connects with other trails, especially the Genesee Valley Greenway south of the city.\n\nOutside of the city, the inner suburbs are similarly hard to walk in, but there are pockets of village-like atmospheres where walking can be pleasant, such as Twelve Corners in Brighton and the Titus-Hudson area of Irondequoit.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bicycle"]},"\n\nMuch of the advice above for pedestrians applies to bikers as well, although bikers won't be able to make use of the Skyway.

The immediate suburbs are crawling with large chain restaurants, but you can find more original fare in the city proper, and in outlying areas away from the biggest commercial strips.\n\nThere is one mainstay of local cuisine that travelers with a large stomach and no fear of cholesterol should absolutely try: the famous ",{"type":"'''","value":["Garbage Plate"]}," of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Nick Tahou's Hots"]},". For a few dollars, a \"Plate\" comes with your choice of meat served on top of macaroni salad, home fries, and onions, topped with \"hot sauce\" and ketchup and\/or mustard. Most suburbs of Rochester have a local \"Hots\" (Penfield Hots, Empire Hots, etc.); each of them, not to mention nearly every other burger joint and diner around town, has its own variant on the \"Plate\"—but the original and most authentic is found at Tahou's. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Steve T. Hots and Potatoes"]}," is the former second location of Nick Tahou's, and run by a different branch of the Tahou family; it's an acceptable second choice, mainly because the original is only open until 8PM these days. Late-night \"plate runs\"—a college tradition in Rochester—thus usually end up at Steve T.'s.\n\nA \"hot\", by the way, is simply a hot dog, but they come in two varieties: red hots (traditional hot dogs) and white hots. White hots are filled with uncured and unsmoked meats, which causes the color difference. The flavor is similar to a mild sausage. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Zweigle's"]}," is the local brand; don't even bother with any other brand if you're going to try a white hot. \"Hot sauce\", rather than the expected mouth-scalding pepper blend, is usually a mildly spicy meat sauce to put on hots, especially on garbage plates.\n\nOf course, if you do want mouth-scalding sauce, ",{"type":"'''","value":["Buffalo-style chicken wings"]}," are almost as popular here as they are in Buffalo. (Surprisingly, though, Buffalo's Anchor Bar—the inventor of the dish—failed in its attempt to establish franchises in Rochester.) Most any bar, bar-like establishment, or pizza joint will have \"wings\" on their menu (no need to specify \"Buffalo wings\"; it's assumed). Everyone has a favorite location for wings, but ",{"type":"'''","value":["Jeremiah's Tavern"]}," has some awards to back up their claim.\n\nIf you're looking for something a little more traditional, Rochester's beaches spawned a great set of local burger joints (most of which don't call them burgers; they're \"ground steak sandwiches\"). The two big local chains are ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bill Gray's"]},", with their flagship location at Seabreeze, and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Tom Wahl's"]},", which started south of the city in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Avon (New York)"],["Avon"]]},". Tom Wahl's is famous for their root beer floats and homemade ice cream, while Bill Gray's has incorporated ",{"type":"'''","value":["Abbott's Frozen Custard"]}," into several of their locations. Both have great burgers and classic old-time atmospheres.\n\nSpeaking of Abbott's, it's ",{"type":"''","value":["the"]}," place to go for ice cream—only it's not ice cream; it's frozen custard, which is richer and creamier than regular ice cream. With about thirty locations around Rochester, you have no excuse not to drop in and try some.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["DiBella's"]}," is a chain of local sub shops that locals swear by, despite some inroads being made by Subway. DiBella's restaurants have a classic 1950s atmosphere, with lots of neon, chrome, and checkerboard patterns. The sub rolls are made fresh in-house each morning, and they're solid and big enough to hold all the toppings you could want. The \"Godfather\" and \"Dagwood\" subs are quite popular. You can order them hot; it takes a few minutes, but it's well worth it. Don't forget to pick up one of Grandma DiBella's chocolate chip cookies; they're also baked fresh in-house and have almost as many fans as the subs do.\n\nFor pizza, everyone has a different favorite. The local style is somewhere between New York thin-crust and Chicago deep-dish–not surprising considering Rochester's location. The oldest local chain, dating from 1947, is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Pontillo's"]},", but quality varies widely from location to location. The best Pontillo's pizzas are truly outstanding, but the worst are truly bad. More consistent quality can be found at another large local chain, ",{"type":"'''","value":["Salvatore's"]},", though pizza aficionados may be disappointed. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mark's Pizzeria"]}," is also popular, and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cam's"]}," is expanding and popular with college students. True New York-style pizza is hard to find, though the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Pizza Stop"]}," on State Street downtown probably comes closest.\n\nIt's not just pizza, either. Rochesterians love all sorts of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Italian food"]},"; it seems like around every corner is another favorite neighborhood Italian-American restaurant, at least in the suburbs. You'll also find a lot of places owned by Greeks, from greasy spoons like Nick Tahou's to classy family restaurants, although they usually toss in plenty of Italian and traditional American entrees as well. A staple at local Greek- and Italian-American restaurants is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Chicken French"]},". It's a breaded chicken breast sauteéd in a lemon-wine sauce. It's so popular that veal and even artichokes can be found \"Frenched\" on local menus.\n\nAll this focus on the lower end of the dining spectrum shouldn't obscure the upscale dining available, mostly in the downtown area. The options are neither as exclusive nor as pretentious as those in other, bigger cities like New York, but that doesn't mean you won't want reservations, and you will want to dress up a bit.\n\nFinally, no trip to Rochester is complete without stopping in to a local ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.wegmans.com Wegmans"]}]}," supermarket. No joke: residents frequently take their out-of-town guests to Wegmans, not necessarily to buy anything, but just to see the place. \"Wait,\" the guests say, \"you're taking us to a grocery store?\" But Wegmans is something special, and Rochesterians are justifiably proud of their hometown grocer. Customer service is paramount at Wegmans, consistently ranked one of the best companies to work for in the U.S. The stores are attractive, clean, well-stocked, and open 24 hours a day. They also each feature an amazing \"Market Cafe\", where a wide variety of prepared foods are available for purchase (eat-in or carry-out), all made in-store from Wegmans-branded grocery items. Don't miss the very good subs; Wegmans' sub shops were modeled after DiBella's and rival Rochester's favorite sub shop in quality.\n\nThere's only one Wegmans left in the city proper, but the suburbs are loaded with them. The flagship location is on Monroe Avenue adjacent to Pittsford Plaza.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Budget"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Eatpricerange"],["up to $10"],["$8–$20"],["$15+"]]},"\n\nRochester's cheapest options are epitomized by the burger joints that sprung up along the lake shore in the middle of the 20th century—Bill Gray's, Vic & Irv's, and Don's Original at Sea Breeze near Irondequoit Bay; and Schallers west of the river.
