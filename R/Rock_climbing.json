The BMC recognises that climbing, hill walking and mountaineering are activities with a danger of personal injury or death.

Free climbing is further categorized by the type of protection used."]},{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Joshua Tree - Illusion Dweller 10.jpg"],["thumb"],["Climber & belayer: the basic climbing team."]]},"\n:* ",{"type":"'''","value":["Trad climbing"]}," (short for \"traditional\") involves the placement of temporary protection such as cams, nuts, and hexes, into the rock's natural features while ascending.
