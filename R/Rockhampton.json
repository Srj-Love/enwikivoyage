Wiseman, who was supposedly inspired by the rocks in the river flowing through the town. \n\nDuring the late 1800s, several nearby gold discoveries ensured continued economic growth of the region, and of Rockhampton itself. Subsequently, as mining, grazing, farming and meat processing industries developed in Central Queensland, Rockhampton thrived as a regional service centre. \n\nRockhampton was finally recognised as a city in 1902, and has continued to grow slowly but steadily ever since. Rockhampton’s current population is around 59,000.  The Rockhampton area is surprisingly busy, with considerable traffic on the roads, and a substantial suburban area.  It has a feel much more of a developed city than of an outback town.\n\nRockhampton is almost universally called ",{"type":"''","value":["Rocky"]},". Just about every business has some variation of ",{"type":"''","value":["Rocky"]}," in their name or their promotion.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Rockhampton Airport (ROK)"]}," is just to the west of the city.

It has an ANZ ATM available, and car hire facilities. There is a small Qantas regional lounge situated next to the Qantas check-in area. There is also an outside observation area.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nRockhampton is accessible by sealed road, most notably the Bruce Highway which travels north from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brisbane"]]},", through Rockhampton and on to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cairns"]]},".

Rockhampton is the terminus of the Liechhardt Highway.  Driving time from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sydney"]]}," is around 16 hours (non-stop).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\nTilt train services run to Rockhampton from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brisbane"]]}," once daily, six days a week.

Most major car rental companies offer car hire in Rockhampton, either at offices in the city or at Rockhampton airport. Roads are typically uncrowded, making driving in the area enjoyable, though drivers are advised to be cautious of the many large trucks on the Bruce highway. When travelling on back roads, watch out for straying livestock. \n\nThere is actually a bit of peak hour in Rockhampton, especially on a Friday afternoon travelling over the bridges towards ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yeppoon"]]},".
