Many prefer to take I-295 (formerly I-95) north to Augusta, and then take State Route 17 east to Rockland.  While longer in distance, the drive is far less stressful and often quicker, despite the longer distance.  Of course, if you are in no hurry and wish to see many of the wonderful sights to be had along Route 1 between Bath and Rockland, then Coastal Route 1 is the way to go.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.state.me.us\/mdot\/opt\/ferry\/maine-ferry-service.php Maine State Ferry Service"]}]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vinalhaven"]]},", North Haven and Matinicus Island."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Farnsworth Art Museum"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.farnsworthmuseum.org\/"],["email="],["address=16 Museum St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +1 207-596-6457"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=10AM-5PM.
