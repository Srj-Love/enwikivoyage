The first Europeans to view the Rockies were a ramshackle collection of pioneers who ventured there on behalf of their respective fur trading companies.  Most significantly, David Thompson ventured through Howse Pass on behalf of the North West Company in 1804, establishing Kootenay House, near what is now ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Invermere"]]},".  \n\nIn 1871, Sir John A MacDonald convinced British Columbia to join Canada with the promise of a national railway that would connect it to the rest of Canada.  The Canadian Pacific Railway was completed on November 7, 1885, and the last spike was driven in Craigellachie, BC. \n\nIn the following 50 years, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Banff"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jasper"]]},", Waterton, Yoho and Kootenay National Parks are established, and the area becomes a tourist destination.

",{"type":"[[","value":[["Banff"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lake Louise"]]}," are likely the most developed towns, while the villages of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Field"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Elkford"]]}," attract more through their natural splendour than via any attractions within the communities themselves.  \n\nThe region is probably one of the most scenic in the world between the spectacular mountains, widespread forests and glacier fed lakes.  The weather in the summer tends to be hot (30°C) and sunny.  In winter it is colder at around -15°C and fantastic for skiing at the area's many resorts.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nThe people living in this area are Anglophone Canadians and therefore speak English.
