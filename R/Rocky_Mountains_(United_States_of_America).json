For the past four centuries, visitors have come to encounter from the long flat plains in the east to the shocking and iconic wall of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Front Range"]]}," just east of the continental divide—the Cheyenne aptly called the mountains, \"Rock on the Horizon.\"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Whitelined Sphinx Hummingbird Moth Colorado.JPG"],["thumb"],["190px"],["Wildlife viewing comes in all sizes in the Rockies: A Whitelined Sphinx Hummingbird Moth sips nectar from a Columbine (the state flower of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Colorado"]]},") in the White River National Forest."]]},"\n\nThe largest and most popular entry point into the region is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Denver"]]},", which is one of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North America"]]},"'s principal rail and flight hubs. Domestic flights to the other major cities in the region, like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cheyenne"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boise"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Billings"]]},", or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jackson (Wyoming)"],["Jackson"]]},", should be easy to find from any ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United States of America"],["American"]]}," hub airport. \n\nRoute 25 is the major north-south highway, leading up from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Mexico"]]},", while I-70, I-80, and I-90\/94 are the major east-west highways. Be aware that passes do get closed due to inclement weather (snow) in winter months, in particular I-70 is prone to this. Bus routes exist, mostly through Greyhound, but given the long distances, flying is often cheaper than paying for gas and bus fares on the road.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nGetting around the Rocky Mountains can be tough. Mountain passes freeze in the winter, as you might expect, and many roads are risky, if not impassable under heavy snow. Moreover, you'll run through more gas per mile in the high altitudes. Flying is often a very good alternative in the winter, since ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Denver"]]}," offers flights straight to ski slopes off in the mountains, as well as to virtually all the cities in the region.\n\nDuring the warmer months, however, driving becomes a ",{"type":"''","value":["great"]}," way to explore the region. Some of the most spectacular drives in the country are located here among the high mountains and endless wilderness. It can also be the ",{"type":"''","value":["only"]}," way to get to destinations off the beaten path, since, as you might expect, there's not a lot of public transportation in this vast and lightly populated section of the country.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Bald Eagle over Yellowstone.jpg"],["200px"],["thumb"],["A bald eagle soaring above ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yellowstone"]]}]]},"\n\nThe sights here are not urban in the slightest. With the exception of Denver, there are no large cities. Wyoming has fewer people than ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alaska"]]}," and is proud to be America's least populated state. Colorado boasts the highest overall elevation in the USA. Come here to admire the wildlife and spectacular vistas in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United States National Parks"],["National Parks"]]},". Many of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North America"]]},"'s most renowned parks are here, from the geysers of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yellowstone"]]},", to the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Glacier National Park"],["glaciers in Montana"]]},", to elk and bighorn sheep wandering among the high peaks of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rocky Mountain National Park"]]},". Black and Grizzly bears, wild cats, and buffalo are also found in the region.\n\nAlso of interest are the old mining and cowboy frontier towns that once comprised of most of the region's population. Many old gold mine towns have transformed themselves into a tourist economy destination, with tours leading right down into old gold mines. The cowboy towns remain, however, and that way of life has not yet died out. A good example is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Leadville"]]},", Colorado. In addition, regional cultures including the indigenous Hispanic and American Indian populations, add long and proud heritages to the mix.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nOutdoor adventure is the entree on the Rocky Mountain platter. There's wonderful hiking just about everywhere, from the ravines in the plains in the east, to canyons in the west, to the high mountain trails along the Rocky Mountains spine. Trails are managed by the National Park service, State Park services, and National Forest and Grasslands services. Camping is widely available throughout all the wilderness regions of the Rocky Mountain states. Outside of the National Parks, it's not even regulated—you can just drive into any national forest and pitch a tent wherever your fancy. Hunting and fishing is regulated heavily by the Department of Fish and Wildlife, to protect local fauna from overhunting, but the activities are widely practiced, and you'll have some beautiful areas in which to enjoy them.\n\nThe biggest draws to the region is the fantastic downhill winter sports. Ski resorts like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Aspen"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vail"]]}," rank among the world's finest, and are priced accordingly. But there's a wealth of other more affordable, and still fantastic options. The ski season in the Rockies starts early in the late Fall, and lasts long until the late Spring. The snow quality is magnificent, and the weather usually surprises with how warm it can be.\n\nSporting events are not quite so widely available as you would find in other parts of the country (simply because there are fewer big cities here), but Denver makes up for that, with a lively sports culture, and one great football team, the Denver Broncos. If you're interested in the cowboy culture of the Rockies, look for a rodeo—especially away from the ski resorts and the biggest national parks, they're not half as touristy as you might suspect.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Jackson Lake.jpg"],["thumb"],["280px"],["Jackson Lake at the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Grand Teton National Park"],["Grand Tetons"]]}]]},"\nYou can find great food in the Rocky Mountains if you know where to look for it. Given the vastness of the region, fine dining is generally concentrated in urban areas like Denver, college towns like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Laramie"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boulder"]]},", the fine old lodges in the most popular National Parks like Yellowstone and the Grand Tetons, as well as the end-destination ski resorts like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jackson Hole"]]},", Aspen, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Telluride"]]}," and Vail. Fast food, chain restaurants, diners and bars and grills are the norm for the majority of the Rockies. Throughout the countryside, you'll be pretty much limited to small places with plenty of character, but also the same old dishes — hamburgers and steak are staples here. It is, however, a very good place to add elk and bison to the list of animals you have consumed.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nDrinking, on the other hand, is a time honored activity in the Rockies, and it is done well. Colorado in particular is home to an enormous quantity of microbreweries, and you'll never be in want of good local beer throughout the region. Liquor laws are very lax compared to the rest of the country (in general, there are fewer laws out here), and you can often pick up some beers at a drive thru window!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nYou're very unlikely to be the victim of crime in the Rockies, but you do need to be vigilant about safety in the wilderness. Don't get too close to buffalo, who will charge your car if provoked (and the bulls can smash a car in two if they want to). Don't leave any food in smellable or reachable containers, and hang your food in a bear bag far enough from your tent where a nosy bear wouldn't check both out in the same outing.\n\nThe cold in the winter is the deadliest force around—-make certain that someone knows where you are when you venture out, and where you plan to go and always research the conditions in advance and prepare for them adequately. Many people die in avalanches and or even freeze to death in their vehicles every year. Lighting is the number one killer at high altitudes and high country weather can change in less than 10 minutes.\n\nMake a point of registering with the local park service when embarking on a multi-day hike, so they know you're out there and have an idea of how to rescue you if that becomes necessary.\n\nRespect private property. If the sign reads no trespassing, it means no trespassing. Many rural residents, while usually friendly to outsiders, own firearms and don't take kindly to unwelcome people venturing onto their land.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\nThe Rockies don't stop here, and there's an extraordinary wealth of high mountain trekking opportunities just west in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Utah"]]},".
