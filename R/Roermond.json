It gained its city charter around 1231 and became the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Roermond in 1559. In the protected city centre you'll find today, many monuments and several churches remain, making Roermond an interesting town to visit. Its location along the so-called ",{"type":"'''","value":["Maasplassen"]},", a 3000-hectare area of lakes, streams and canals makes it a popular destination for water sports and also yachts, and it has a number of good marinas.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nRoermond receives a large number of visitors every year, and is a rather well known destination for Dutch, German and to a lesser degree Belgian tourists. Apart from the water sports facilities and historic centre, this is also due to successful efforts to turn Roermond into a prime shopping centre for the larger region. The large Designer Outlet Centre, opened by McArthurGlen in 2001, alone draws in some 3.75 million visitors per year. The city centre has also been praised for its ample shopping facilities, and as shops are open on Sunday, Roermond draws in plenty of daytrip visitors from all directions, including many Germans.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Tourist Information Office (VVV)"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.vvvmiddenlimburg.nl\/"],["email="],["address=Markt 17"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +31 475-335847"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Located on the market square, the VVV office provides information, can assist in booking of hotels or activities and sells or distributes a collections of maps and informative publications.
