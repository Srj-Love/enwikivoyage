A Harappan site with painted grey ware artifacts has been discovered near a village in Rohtak district in Haryana. The site with painted grey ware remains dating back to the Mahabharata period has been discovered at village Girawad on the Madina-Samargopalpur road, in Rohtak district.  \n\nThis site was found on February 19, this year by a research scholar Vivek Dangi, under a team led by deputy director J S Khatri. The team proceeded from Meham towards Madina and discovered the site at village Girawad.Site was spread over an area of 25 acres and rose about 1.5 metres in height from the ground. Material culture available from the site indicates that the economy of Girawad was based on agriculture. Boundary wall, early Harappan pottery, furnaces and other antiquities found during surface explorations are sufficient evidence to prove its antiquity to that of early Harappan times. \n\nAs many as 45 early-Harappan and Harappan sites had so far been discovered on the ancient river bed of Drishadvati and its tributaries in Meham Block itself.
