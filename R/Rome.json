Rome's history is long and complex. What follows is merely a quick summary.\n\nRome is traditionally thought to have been founded by the mythical twins Romulus and Remus, who were abandoned as infants in the Tiber River and raised by a mother wolf before being found by a shepherd who raised them as his own sons. Rome was founded as a small village sometime in the 8th century BC surrounding the Palatine Hill, including the area where the Roman Forum is found. Due to the village's position at a ford on the Tiber River, Rome became a crossroads of traffic and trade.\n\nThe settlement developed into the capital of the Roman Kingdom, led by a series of Etruscan kings, before becoming the seat of the Roman Republic at around 500 BC, and then the center of the Roman Empire from 27 BC on. For almost a thousand years, Rome was the largest, wealthiest, most powerful city in the Western World, with dominance over most of Europe and the Mediterranean Sea. Even after the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century AD, Rome maintained considerable importance and wealth.\n\nBeginning with the reign of Constantine I, the Bishop of Rome (later known as the Pope) gained political and religious importance, establishing Rome as the center of the Catholic Church. During the Early Middle Ages, the city declined in population but gained a new importance as the capital of the newly formed Papal States. Throughout the Middle Ages, Rome was a major pilgrimage site and the focus of struggles between the Holy Roman Empire and the Papacy.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Santa Maria in Trastevere front.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["250px"],["The Santa Maria in Trastevere church, a symbol of early medieval Rome."]]},"\n\nWith the Italian Renaissance fully under way in the 15th century, Rome changed dramatically. Extravagant churches, bridges, and public spaces, including a new Saint Peter's Basilica and the Sistine Chapel, were constructed by the Papacy so that Rome would equal the grandeur of other Italian cities of the period. \nIn the 19th century, Rome again became the focus of a power struggle with the rise of the Kingdom of Italy, which wished to see a reunification of Italy. The Papal States remained in control of Rome under French protection, but with the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, French troops were forced to abandon Rome, leaving it clear for the Kingdom of Italy to capture. Rome became the capital of Italy, and has remained such ever since.\n\nRome today is a contemporary metropolis that reflects the many periods of its long history - Ancient times, Middle Ages, the Renaissance and the Modern Era. With the rise of Italian Fascism following World War I, Rome's population grew. This trend was stopped by World War II, which dealt relatively minor damage to Rome. With the dismantlement of the monarchy and the creation of the Italian Republic following WWII, Rome again began to grow in population and became a modern city. The city stands today as the capital of Italy and one of the world's major tourist destinations.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh =   12"],["febhigh =   13"],["marhigh =   15"],["aprhigh =   18"],["mayhigh =   23"],["junhigh =   27"],["julhigh =   30"],["aughigh =   31"],["sephigh =   27"],["octhigh =   21"],["novhigh =   16"],["dechigh =   13"],["janlow =   3"],["feblow =   4"],["marlow =   5"],["aprlow =   8"],["maylow =   12"],["junlow =   15"],["jullow =   18"],["auglow =   18"],["seplow =   15"],["octlow =   11"],["novlow =   7"],["declow =   4"],["janprecip = 70"],["febprecip = 73"],["marprecip = 58"],["aprprecip = 81"],["mayprecip = 53"],["junprecip = 34"],["julprecip = 19"],["augprecip = 37"],["sepprecip = 73"],["octprecip = 113"],["novprecip = 115"],["decprecip = 81"]]},"\n\nRome has a Mediterranean climate, with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters.

It will take a few weeks to understand where to drive, to get where you want to go. When driving in Rome it is important to accept that Italians drive in a very pragmatic way.  Taking turns and letting people go in front of you is rare. There is little patience so if the light is green when you go into the intersection and you are too slow they will let you know. A green light turning to amber is a reason to accelerate, not brake, in part because the lights usually stay amber for several seconds. If you brake immediately when the light changes you are likely to get rear-ended.

Also, some airport employees may direct you to a 'Taxi' driver if you ask where you find them when you are inside the airport terminal. The 'Taxi' could end up being a Mercedes limo, costing you double the fare of a real taxi, and a tricky situation to get out of as your luggage is locked away in the limo's trunk."]]},"\n \nTaxis are the most expensive way to get around Rome, but when weighed against convenience and speed, they are often worth it.  Roman taxis run on meters, and you should always make sure the driver starts the meter. Taxis will typically pick you up only at a taxi stand, which you will find at all but the smallest piazzas, as well as at the main train station or when called by phone. Flagging down a taxi (like in London) is possible but quite rare as the taxi drivers prefer to use the stands. When you get in the cab, there will be a fixed starting charge, which will be more for late nights, Sundays and holidays. Supplements will be requested for bags that the driver has to handle, typically €1 per bag. So, if you have a limited amount of luggage that wouldn't need to go in the trunk, you may decline when the driver offers to put your bags in the trunk. Drivers may not use the shortest route, so try to follow the route with a map and discuss if you feel you're being tricked.\n\nBe warned that when you phone for a taxi, the cab's meter starts running when it is summoned, not when it arrives to pick you up, so by the time a cab arrives at your location, there may already be a substantial amount on the meter. A major problem is that taxi drivers often leave the previous fare running on the meter. So you may find the cab arriving with €15 or even more on the meter. If you are not in a hurry you should tell him (there are very few female cab drivers in Rome) to get lost, but if you are desperate to get to the airport it's a different matter. You can get a taxi pretty easily at any piazza though, so calling ahead is really not required. A trip completely across the city (within the walls) will cost about €11 if starting at a cab rank, a little more if there is heavy traffic at night or on a Sunday.  Taxi drivers can often try to trick customers by switching a €50 note for a €10 note during payment, leading you to believe that you handed them only €10 when you have already given them €50.\nThe main taxi companies may be called at ",{"type":"'''","value":["063570"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["065551"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["064994"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["066645"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["0688177"]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["On foot"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Directions Rome.JPG"],["thumb"],["250px"],["right"],["Directions for pedestrians on a wall near Piazza Navona"]]},"\nOnce you're in the center, you are best off on foot.

There are crosswalks, but they are rarely located at signaled intersections. Traffic can be intimidating, but if you are at a crosswalk just start walking and cars will let you cross the street. While crossing watch out for the thousands of mopeds. As in many European cities, even if the cars and trucks are stationary due to a jam or for another legal reason, mopeds and bikes will be trying to squeeze through the gaps and may be ignoring the reason why everyone else has stopped.

Unless you take many rides spread all over the day, the single ticket ride option is preferable. Calculating if a pass is worth it is easy since a single ticket ride costs €1.50. For example, for a daily ticket (€6) to be worth it, you would have to make 5 or more trips at intervals greater than 100 minutes apart on a single day.

The stricter churches usually have vendors just outside selling inexpensive scarves and sometimes plastic pants.  But relatively few churches  enforce dress codes and you can wander into most wearing shorts, sleeveless shirts, or pretty much anything without problems.  It is, however, good to keep one's dress tasteful, as these are still churches and houses of prayer for many people.

Many apartments can be booked directly through the owner, but most owners make arrangements via rental agencies, both large and small.

Police are also generally friendly if not always helpful. Carabinieri (black uniform, red striped trousers) are military police, and Polizia (blue and grey uniform) are civilians, but they both do essentially the same thing and are equally good, or bad.

They buffet you and have bags to hide where their hands are.\nYou have been warned!\n\nAlso, beware of thieves—one popular technique that they use is to ride by you on a moped, slice the strap of a handbag with a knife, and ride off. They might also try to cut the bottom of your bag open and pick your wallet from the ground. Others will use the old trick of one person trying to distract you (asking for a cigarette or doing a strange dance) while another thief picks your pockets from behind. Bands of gypsy kids will sometimes crowd you and reach for your pockets under the cover of newspapers or cardboard sheets. It is generally a good idea to be extremely wary of any strange person who gets too close to you, even in a crowd. If someone is in your personal space, shove the person away. As one frequent traveller put it, \"Don't be afraid to be a dick in Rome.\" It is better to be rude than to be stolen from.\n\nTermini (the main railway station), Esquilino, bus line 64 (Termini to San Pietro), and the Trevi fountain are well known for pickpockets, so take extra care in these areas.

Most of them occur regularly in Rome and you will want to see them coming.\n\nA particular scam is when some plainclothes police will approach you, asking to look for \"drug money,\" or ask to see your passport. This is a scam to take your money. You can scare them by asking for their ID. Guardia di Finanza (the grey uniformed ones) do customs work.\n\nA recent scam involves men working near the Spanish Steps, around Piazza Navona, and outside of the Colosseum. They approach you, asking where you are from, and begin to tie bracelets around your wrists. When they are done they will try to charge you upwards of €20 for each bracelet. If anyone makes any attempt to reach for your hand, retract quickly. If you get trapped, you can refuse to pay, but this may not be wise if there are not many people around.  Carry small bills or just change, in your wallet, so if you find yourself in cornered to pay for the bracelet, you can convince them that €1 or €2 is all you have.\n\nWhen taking a ",{"type":"'''","value":["taxi"]},", be sure to remember license number written on the card door.

A car may pull up next to you, and the driver asks you for directions to the Vatican. He will strike up a conversation with you while he sits in his car and tell you he is a sales representative for a large French fashion house. He will then tell that you he likes you and he would like to give you a gift of a coat worth several thousand euros. As you reach inside his car to take the bag the coat is in, he will ask you for €200 for gas, as his car is nearly empty.\n\nAround tourist sites like the Trevi Fountain, Colosseum and the Spanish Steps there are groups mostly of men trying to sell cheap souvenirs. They may also carry roses and say they are giving you a gift because they like you, but the minute you take their 'gift' they demand money. They are often very insistent and often the only way to get rid of them is to be plain rude. Do the best you can to not take their \"gifts\" as they will follow you around asking for money. Simply saying \"no\" or \"go away\" will get them off your back until the next vendor comes up to you.\n\nBe wary of places to change currency. Read ALL signs before changing money. Oftentimes places set up just for currency exchange will add as much as a 20% service fee on all money being traded. The shops near the Vatican have especially high service fees, whereas places near the Trevi Fountain will be more reasonable. The best bet is to change enough money before you leave your home country. There are few places around the city that are under the table and are just interested in American money. These places charge no service fee.\n\nThe best advice to avoid scams is to get way from anyone that you have never seen before who starts talking to you.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Emergencies"]},"\n\nIn an emergency, call 112 (Carabinieri), 113 (Police), 118 (medical first aid) or 115 (firemen).
