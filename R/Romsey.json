Southampton Airport Parkway railway station is next to the airport terminal - trains run directly to Romsey twice an hour.\n\nFrom Heathrow take the railair coach service to Woking station, then take a train to Winchester, Southampton Airport or Southampton Central for connections to Romsey.\n\nFrom Gatwick take a direct train to Southampton Central, and change there for a train to Romsey.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Car"]},":\n\nRomsey has very good road links to other parts of the country.

From ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bristol"]]}," and South Wales it is usually quicker to travel via the M4 and A34 than the shorter but much slower A36. Likewise from the South West of England, the route via the A303, B3089, Salisbury and the A27 is often quicker than the A35 and A31.\n\nParking in Romsey can be difficult on Saturdays, but not any more so than at other market towns.
