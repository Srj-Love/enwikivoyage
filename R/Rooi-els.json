The local baboons roam the area frequently and should not be fed. It is on the eastern shore of False Bay, just to the south of the mouth of the Rooi-els river, and below the Klein Hangklip. There is a very pleasant little beach which is fairly sheltered from south west swells, and is generally safe for swimming. The Rooi-els river flows into the bay at the south end of the beach, and is usually only inches deep and a pleasant place for kids to play. The town is quite exposed to the south east wind in summer, which can be unpleasantly strong, but is often mild and keeps the place cool. Winter can be beautiful, if the wind is light and the weather sunny, and when the wind and waves are up, the surf pounds on the rocky shoreline and throws spray high into the air. It is a pleasant place to get away from the city for a few days, or to enjoy a quiet vacation for a week or so at almost any time of the year.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nFrom ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cape Town"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hermanus"]]}," by car on the R44 regional road.
