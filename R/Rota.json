On that date the CNMI Covenant required that the CNMI Federalization of Immigration law became effective. The CNMI remains under CNMI Customs laws.\n\nThe Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands\nin Political Union with the United States of America defines the unique relationship between the Northern Mariana Islands and the United States, recognizing U.S. sovereignty but limiting, in some respects, applicability of federal law. The Covenant was negotiated over the course of twenty-seven months (December 1972 to February 1975) by the Marianas Political Status Commission (an organization representing the Northern Mariana Islands) and a delegation representing the United States. The proposed Covenant was signed by negotiators on February 15, 1975, at Saipan. The Covenant is codified at 48 U.S.C. § 1801 note, reprinted in the Northern Mariana Islands Commonwealth Code (with case annotations) and is also sold in pamphlet format by the Commonwealth Law Revision Commission. \n\nPursuant to Section 1003(a), some Covenant provisions became effective on March 24, 1976, the date of final approval. Remaining provisions took effect on January 9, 1978, and November 4, 1986, the dates specified in Presidential proclamations issued pursuant to Section 1003(b)-(c). On the latter date, qualified residents of the Northern Mariana Islands became U.S. citizens. On June 29, 2009 U.S. Immigration Laws were to take effect, however, they were delayed until November 28, 2009.\n\nU.S. Public Law 94-241, § 1, Mar. 24, 1976, 90 Stat. 263, the measure approving the Covenant, was originally reprinted in the U.S. Code in a note under 48 U.S.C. § 1681. In an official edition of the U.S. Code published in 1986, several provisions of the act were codified (as amended) as 48 U.S.C. §§ 1801-1805. (See also C-201 et seq.)\n\nThe Covenant is an agreement entered into between the United States government and the government and people of the Northern Mariana Islands. The parties entered into agreement as two separate but equal sovereign entities. The Covenant governs the relationship between the parties.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nCar rentals are available.
