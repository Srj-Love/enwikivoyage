[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Rotterdam Banner 4.jpg"],["dotm=yes"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/en.rotterdam.info\/visitors\/ Rotterdam"]}]}," is a city in the province of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South Holland"]]}," in the west of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Netherlands"]]},". The city is the second largest in the country with a population of approximately 617,000 inhabitants in the municipality and about 1.3 million inhabitants in its metropolitan area. Rotterdam is one of Europe's most vibrant, multicultural cities; it is known for its university (Erasmus), cutting-edge architecture, lively cultural life, striking riverside setting, its maritime heritage and colourful summer events.\n\nStarting as a dam constructed in 1270 on the Rotte River, Rotterdam has grown into a major international commercial centre. The port of Rotterdam is Europe's busiest port by cargo tonnage, and was the world's busiest from 1962 until it was surpassed by Shanghai in 2004. Rotterdam's commercial and strategic importance is based on its location near the mouth of the Nieuwe Maas (New Meuse), a channel in the delta formed by the Rhine and Meuse on the North Sea. These rivers lead directly into the centre of Europe, including the industrial Ruhr region, which is why Rotterdam is often called the \"Gateway to Europe\".\n\nThe bombing of Rotterdam on May 14, 1940 by Nazi Germany forced the Dutch army to capitulate. The centre of Rotterdam was almost completely destroyed by the Luftwaffe, with 900 civilians killed and 80,000 homeless. Rotterdam was gradually rebuilt from the 1950s through the 1990s. Daring and new styles of apartments, office buildings and recreation facilities resulted in Rotterdam becoming a city of modern architecture and the only city in the Netherlands with an impressive modern skyline.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Blaeu 1652 - Rotterdam.jpg"],["thumbnail"],["right"],["Map of Rotterdam in 1652"]]},"\nSettlement at the lower end of the fen stream ",{"type":"''","value":["Rotte"]}," dates from at least 900. Around 1150, large floods in the area ended development, leading to the construction of protective dikes and dams. A dam on the Rotte or 'Rotterdam' was built in the 1260s and was located at the present-day ",{"type":"''","value":["Hoogstraat"]}," ('High Street').\n\nAlthough Rotterdam did well after the Middle Ages and in the 'Golden Century' - roughly between 1650 and 1750) it was not before the second part of the nineteenth century that the city started to develop itself rapidly. Helped by the digging of a new seaway (The Nieuwe Waterweg) Rotterdam was rid of access problems caused by the silting of the river and started receiving ever bigger ships with cargo for\/from the booming Ruhrgebiet in Germany. Port related trade and industry skyrocketed, and the city started to draw lots of migrants from the then poor Brabant province, for whom the southern part of the city was constructed. At the turn of the twentieth century Rotterdam was well under way to become the largest economic centre in The Netherlands. It was between then and the second world war that large prestigious construction works were undertaken, in part to show off the new found economic pride.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Rotterdam.jpg"],["thumbnail"],["right"],["Rotterdam was almost completely razed by Nazi bombings during World War II"]]},"\nThe German army invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940. Germany had planned to conquer the country in one day, but after meeting unexpectedly fierce resistance, it finally forced the Dutch army to capitulate on 14 May 1940 by bombing Rotterdam and threatening to bomb other cities. The heart of the city was almost completely destroyed by the German Luftwaffe, and 800 people were killed, while about 80,000 others were made homeless. During the war, Rotterdam was bombed several times during allied raids that were aimed at the harbour area but sometimes also hit the city. \nThe City Hall survived the bombing. Unlike most other European cities however, the City Council did not aim at rebuilding what was lost, but on taking the opportunity to create a 'new' and better city. Damaged but not destroyed old builings were torn down in the process.\n\nFrom the 1950s through the 1970s, the city was rebuilt. It remained quite windy and open until the city councils from the 1980s on began developing an active architectural policy. Daring and new styles of apartments, office buildings and recreation facilities resulted in a more 'livable' city center with a new skyline. In the 1990s, the ",{"type":"''","value":["Kop van Zuid"]}," was built on the south bank of the river as a new business center.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Demographics"]},"\nIn the Netherlands, Rotterdam has the highest percentage of foreigners from non-industrialised nations. Nearly 50% of the population are not native to the Netherlands or have at least one parent born outside the country. Recent figures show that Muslims comprise close to 25% of the city's population. The city is also home to one of the largest Cape Verdean communities in the world, as well as the largest Dutch Antillean community.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Atmosphere"]},"\nThe atmosphere of Rotterdam is absolutely distinct from other Dutch cities. The mentality can best be described as 'can do'. From the waiters you meet to the businessmen and the people who have just arrived as migrants, all of them breathe a dynamic optimism of getting forward with things and their town. The modern looks of the city, the bustle and its building spree all add to this impression. That said, you might also find that people are sometimes somewhat too straight with you. And yes, the city is not the cosiest, or the most picturesque of towns, especially on drab winter days. But; get acquainted with this small metropolis, easiest done on days of one of the festivals with nice weather, and you will come to love it.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Rotterdam haringvliet in winter.jpg"],["thumbnail"],["right"],["Winters in Rotterdam are moist and thus can be freezingly cold, but just as well uniquely beautiful"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nOne may also find that visiting this city in spring or summer time is more enjoyable than in winter time, as the Netherlands can be a rainy place and Rotterdam is a city that especially gains a lot of charm when the sun is shining.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Tourist information"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=ROTTERDAM.INFO (VVV)"],["alt=Tourist office"],["url=http:\/\/www.rotterdam.info"],["email="],["address=Binnenwegplein, Coolsingel 195-197"],["lat=51.91864"],["long=4.47991"],["directions=Metro: Beurs"],["phone=+31 10 2710120"],["tollfree="],["fax=+31 10 2710128"],["hours=M-F 10:00-19:00; Sa 09:30-18:00; Su 10:00-17:00 (closed: 1 Jan, 25+26 Dec, 31 Dec from 17:00)"],["price="],["content=This well equipped and recently modernized tourist office can provide loads of information like city maps, small guide books, souvenirs and the like, and offers tips and information on what to see and do in Rotterdam.
