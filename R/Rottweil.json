The walls are no longer complete, but you can certainly follow their course around three of the four sides of the town. On the fourth side, there was no real need for a wall, as the landscape drops down to a deep river valley.\n\nWithin the walls is a main street lined with traditional German town houses. An especially attractive one houses the tourist information. Opposite is the small town museum. At the top os the street is the town gate which still imposes its presence and limits entrance to the town.\n\nThe setting of the town can probably best be appreciated in the North East corner.
