Ancient Greek mathematicians calculated that the world was round and speculated on how to follow it all the way.

One reason is that air travel is a polluting form of transport. Another is that the joy of traveling is the journey itself and the many places and experiences that come from passing through countries rather than flying over them. \n\nMany people plan to travel around the world without using air transport by using a combination of sea, rail and road, although generally it is almost impossible not to include some air transport on the way, due to the cost of covering the oceans and for political reasons in some parts of the world.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get around\/Itineraries "]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Arranged trips "]},"\nThere are a limited number of arranged overland trips around the world. Some travel agents arrange places on freight ships going around the world, and some ",{"type":"[[","value":[["cruise ships"],["cruise companies"]]}," also offer round the world cruises. These usually last about 100 days, and prices begin at USD 15,000. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" On your own "]},"\nA possibly cheaper and definitely more adventurous way is to combine scheduled intercity bus, train and boat connections to go around the world. You plan your trip from scratch and set your own schedule - however this will mean a lot more planning than eg. flying round the world through ten cities. Remember that your itinerary will very likely include places far off the beaten track and far away from everything. Consult the articles for each of the countries you plan to travel to in order to learn about the connections and travel conditions.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" General considerations "]},"\n\nCrossing from ",{"type":"'''","value":["Europe to Asia"]}," or vice versa can be done relatively easy - you can take a train from most major European cities to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]}," and travel by the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Trans Siberian"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beijing"]]},". Travel through Central Asia or Middle East is possible but requires more visas and more changes of buses and trains.\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Pacific ocean"]}," is by far the greatest obstacle to completing a circuit around the world overland; There are no ferries between either Indonesia or New Zealand to Australia, nor are there any sort of regular services from Asia or Australia to the thousands of islands in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Polynesia"]]},". Further north the Bering strait between Russia and Alaska doesn't have any scheduled traffic crossing it either. This means you either have to shell out more money than a plane ticket on the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["cruise ships"]]}," that do cover this route - Japan to Alaska is the most economical option - or opt for the option more in the spirit of such a journey; ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Freighter travel"]]},". New Zealand, which maintains loose associations with a number of small islands in the Pacific, sometimes offers for people to join on the semi regular freight routes, supplying these islands, but natives are always given priority, and securing a spot on these trips are not trivial, and requires much perseverance. \n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Atlantic"]}," has similar difficulties, but Cunard Line's ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cunard.com"]}," proud historical ocean liners, still ply the route between Southampton and New York, and are much more economically feasible than the trans-pacific cruises. Quite many recreational sailors cross the Atlantic and it is possible to get on board these boats. Headstrong, experienced travellers with a very loose timetable could attempt to cross the North Atlantic on fishing vessels - Greenland to Iceland is, while in no way easy, possibly doable, and from Iceland there are regular ferries to the Faeroe Islands and Denmark on the European mainland with Smyril line ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.smyrilline.fo"]},". But how to cover the strait between Canada and Greenland is not immediately clear, it may be possible to hire experienced Inuit to cross the strait on dog sleighs during the winter. One solution would be flying from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Halifax (Nova Scotia)"],["Halifax"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Reykjavík"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Iceland"]]},", taking a bus to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Seyðisfjörður"]]}," and the ferry on to Europe. \n\nPerhaps surprisingly, another obstacle is the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Eastern Panama"],["Darién Gap"]]}]}," a small 160 kilometre stretch of dense marshy jungle, made even more dangerous by guerrillas fighting in the area, between Panama and Colombia. Yes, this means there are no roads between ",{"type":"'''","value":["Central and South America"]},", there are no ferries covering the gap either, but backpacker traffic is so heavy that there is a fairly organised line of private vessels operating between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cartagena (Colombia)"],["Cartagena"]]}," and the Portobelo Area or Carti in Panama.
