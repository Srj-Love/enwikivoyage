The complex is noted for its beautiful and well-preserved medieval frescoes."]},"\nIn order to get there you can take a train to Ivanovo(2 lev each way) from the main train station in Ruse, it will take 25min, then walk to the north part of the town and turn right when you see the sign about the Ivanovo Cave Monasteries. There is a 6km walk but you can hitchike any of the continous cars that goes on purpose to see the caves on that road. Normally is 4lev to enter the Cave-Church but you can pretend to be student and just pay 1 lev.\n\nThe caves in the region had been inhabited by monks from the 1220s, when it was founded by the future Patriarch of Bulgaria Joachim, to the 17th century, where they hewed cells, churches and chapels out of solid rock. At the peak of the monastery complex, the number of churches was about 40, while the other premises were around 300, most of which are not preserved today.\n\nSecond Bulgarian Empire rulers such as Ivan Alexander and Ivan Asen II frequently made donations to the complex, as evidenced by donor portraits in some of the churches. Other patrons included nobles from the capital Tarnovo and nearest big medieval town Cherven, with which the monastery complex had strong ties in the 13-th and 14-th century. It was a centre of hesychasm in the Bulgarian lands in the 14th century and continued to exist in the early centuries of the Ottoman rule of Bulgaria, but gradually decayed.\n\nThe monastery complex owes much of its fame to 13th- and 14th-century frescoes, preserved in 5 of the churches, which are thought of as wonderful examples of Bulgarian mediaeval art. The rock premises used by the monks include the St Archangel Michael Chapel (\"The Buried Church\"), the Baptistery, the Gospodev Dol Chapel, the St Theodore Church (\"The Demolished Church\") and the main Church, with the 14th-century murals in the latter one being arguably the most famous of all in Ivanovo and noted as some of the most representative examples of Palaeologan art. Many century-old inscriptions have also been preserved in the monastical premises, including the famous indented inscription of the monk Ivo Gramatik from 1308–1309.\n\n The Rock-hewn Churches of Ivanovo were included in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["UNESCO World Heritage List"]]}," in 1979.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["drink"],["name=PublixCafe"],["url=http:\/\/www.publixcafe.com"],["email="],["address=Dondukov-Korsakov 19 Str."],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Well known cafe in Ruse.
