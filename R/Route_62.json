[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Itinerary banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["itinerary"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Route 62"]}," is an important Historical Route that links small farming communities with the two major harbour towns of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cape Town"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Port Elizabeth"]]},". The similarities between Route 62 and Route 66 in America make them almost twins. They were both built to connect small farming communities with two major harbour towns in the 1920’s and they were both replaced by highways in the 1950’s. Like the Route 66 in the USA, Route 62 lost its glory when the N2 Highway through the seemingly endless cornfields was completed in 1958.\n\nClose to midway between Cape Town and the Garden Route lies a cluster of 5 unique and special villages comprising Montagu (well-known for its friendly accommodation and hot springs and also voted by 2,4million people their ‘Village of the Year’) Robertson, Ashton, Bonnievale (centre of the Valley of Wine and Roses-Robertson Wine Valley) and McGregor (old cottages and arts). Together these make up the Langerberg  Municipality – branded as HEART of ROUTE 62, offering a third major destination in the Cape for visitors to spend 4 or 5 days.\n\nRoute 62 offers more sun and fun-days than coastal tourism destinations and is also less crowded, less expensive and much friendlier. From Cape Town to Oudtshoorn, the Route 62 option is70 km shorter than the N2. Whilst on the way to The Garden Route, you also pass through no less than 14 beautiful and historical villages lined by stunning mountain ranges. The diversity of vegetation and scenery makes this route The Traveller’s Route and one should spend as much time as possible enjoying the drive and relaxing (while saving fuel) for 4 or 5 days at The HEART of ROUTE 62.\nBelow is an outline itinerary, outlining all that the Heart of Route 62 has to offer.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Day 1: Arrival in Cape Town"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Day 2: Cape Town"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cape Town"]]}," has a rich and multi-cultural history because of its position as a stopping point for ships plying their trade between East and West.

Southern Right whales can be distinguished from other whales from its V-shaped ‘blow’ and the callosities which appear around its head. They start arriving in May in order to calf in the shallow water, to raise their young or to mate. Peak times for seeing whales daily is from August to November, tailing off in December.
