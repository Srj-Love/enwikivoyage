Don't be surprised as the road becomes Highway 117, part of the Transcanadian Highway. You will remain on that road for most of the 6 hour drive. There are several towns along the way where one can stop for food. Don't expect a high culinary experience during the trip. If at all possible, you should try to avoid the overpriced and generally not so great food at La Domaine in the Parc de la Vérendrye (one of Quebec's national\/provincial park or ",{"type":"''","value":["réserve faunique"]},").\n\nBy Bus: Three busses depart daily from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Montreal"]]},"'s ",{"type":"''","value":["Station centrale"]}," = on Maisonneuve by the Maheux company.

It is recommended to cross the street and eat in a restaurant different from the one where the bus stops because the latter is more expensive.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nDriving in a small town in northern Quebec is fairly easy. The streets are wide, parking is normally available anywhere and at anytime. Driving is often more practical than the city bus system, which, although generally well suited to the needs of the locals, is not so great for tourists. The bus system has three lines, two of which run only every 2 hours off-hours. It also runs only during the week and during normal store opening hours. \n\nCycling is probably one of the easiest way to get around the city. You can ride anywhere in Rouyn-Noranda. It is quite safe given the width of the streets and the sparsity of traffic. Several bike paths have been built, some around the Lac Osisko, which borders the downtown area.\n\nIn the winter, snow paths are built within the city and it is possible to get around town with a snowmobile.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nSeveral festivals take place:\n",{"type":"*","value":["La fête d'hiver"]},{"type":"*","value":["Festival de musique émergente"]},{"type":"*","value":["Festival du cinéma international en Abitibi-Témiscamingue"]},{"type":"*","value":["Festival du DocuMenteur de l'Abitibi-Témiscamingue"]},{"type":"*","value":["Festival Nez à nez"]},{"type":"*","value":["Festival des guitare du monde de l'Abitibi-Témiscamingue"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["La Muse Gueule (Abstracto)"]},{"type":"*","value":["Café Bistro Chez Bob"]},{"type":"*","value":["Bistro Chez Jezz"]},{"type":"*","value":["La Semence (shop)"]},"In any case, you should try the Poutine. The best poutine in Rouyn-Noranda (and,as the sign says, presumably the best poutine in the world) can be eaten at «Poutinerie du cuivre» on the mall. Or if you are in their close time you could try «Morasse Poutine» on the murdoch street. It is particularly appreciated on friday and saturday nights at 3am when bars close and all the young people meet there for a late night snack.
