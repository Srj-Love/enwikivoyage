It is easily accessible from Sydney and is popular for picnics, walking and other recreation.  The picnic areas within the park are largely at Audley, next to the Hacking River.  The Audley Boatshed and Visitor's Centre are there too.  However, there are many other picnic areas within the park, and many other areas to explore.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\n\nThis is general guidance how to get in to the park.  The park itself is large, so check your plan your itinerary carefully, especially if you are not driving, to ensure you can get to where you want to be.  Information on accessing specific destinations within the park is contained within the destination information, below. \n\nYou can drive or walk through the park at any time, but the picnic areas close at sunset and people staying late will be ejected by the private security employed in the park.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By train "]},"\n\nThere are  ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.131500.info train services"]}," from Sydney City to Loftus, Engadine, Heathcote and Waterfall stations which are on the western perimeter of the park.  From each of these stations you can access several signposted bushwalks.  Given time, you can even walk between them.  At each of these entry points there are shops to purchase food a drinks.  However it is not straightforward to access Audley, the main picnic areas, or the coastal areas of the park from these access points.  The services run to these suburbs at 30 minute frequency and take 45 minutes for the trip.\n\nTo access Audley from Loftus walk east from Loftus following the tramline and the 45 minute easy walk to Bungonia Lookout over the river and Audley.  Consider it you want to walk down the hill to Audley (or more to the point, consider if you want to walk back).  \n\nTo access Audley From Waterfall follow the Uloola track for 3 hours to Audley passing Uloola falls, follow the signs from the station carpark.\n\nThere are hourly train services to Otford on the southern boundary of the park.  This is an access point to the southern end of the coast walk.  It is a 10 minute steep uphill walk from the station to the park boundary at Bald Hill, it is signposted.  It is about an hour walk to Werrong beach (nudist) or two hours to Burning Palms beach from this point.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Ferry from Cronulla to Bundeena.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["Ferry from Cronulla to Bundeena"]]},"\n\nThere are also train services to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sydney\/Cronulla"],["Cronulla"]]}," to meet a ferry ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cronullaandnationalparkferrycruises.com"]}," to ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bundeena"]},".

Although the park is not of the scale of other Australian National Parks, it is still possible to become lost.\n\nThe park is one of the best places to do day walks from Sydney. You can walk along spectacular sandstone cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean with views to the north to Sydney or to the south to Wollongong. Alternatively you can walk in the river valleys behind the headlands. There you will find tall rainforest trees such as the Lilly Pilly Acmena smithii or the fragrant Celery wood Polysias elegans. \n\nSome of the walks are described on the park web page ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au\/parks.nsf\/ParkContentByDistance\/N0030?OpenDocument&ParkKey=N0030&Type=I"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Lady Carrington Drive"]}," from Audley or Forest Island.

It passes depression-era huts set in a valley with deer at Era, and no shortage of kangaroos.  This walk is recommended to take 2 days. You can camp at North Era with a permit.  If you are fit and keen the walk can be done in one day.

It is a truly beautiful spot and the combination of lagoon and surf swimming between rugged cliffs is fantastic.  However you will not be the first person to discover the location, and it is quite popular on summer weekends. At many times Wattamolla is simply a paradise lost, now with too many people, tourists, groups and crowds to truly relax.  Try a weekday evening to have more space to yourself, arriving at 4PM during the summer still gives you 3 full hours to enjoy the beach.  You will no doubt see people jumping from the cliffs into the lagoon below, and swinging from ropes and jumping.  The lagoon is very variable depth, and people have had serious injuries jumping here, and needless to say the activity is not allowed.  The surf beach is not patrolled, and is not really suitable for surfing, due to the cliffs to either side of the beach.  Access Wattamolla by car.

From here you can paddle around the picnic areas and clearings of Audley.   If you want a bit of a longer jaunt, load your boat or canoe with water and snacks, and head upriver.  The right fork is a wider clearer trip up Kangaroo Creek, see sandstone cliffs, turtles and birdlife in an easy 1hr paddle.  Take the left fork under the timber bridge to head up the river proper.  How far you can get depends on recent rainfall and how overgrown with reeds the river is at the time.  You can probably count on a good 2 1\/2 hours of paddling to reach the limit of canoe navigation.  This fork is probably not as scenic, and a bit harder going, but after 45 minutes you can count on having the river to yourself, with the consequent increase in wildlife spotting opportunities if you are quiet.  There are some muddy landing spots upriver you can stop at if you are keen, on the right of the river it is inaccessible except by canoe.  Private craft are not allowed in the river.  Swimming is not allowed near the picnic areas at Audley, but there are a few nice spots to jump in after you have been canoeing for a while upriver.\nUpdate - Private craft ( canoes & kayaks )are allowed.
