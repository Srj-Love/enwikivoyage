For around 10 dollars you can also buy a \"growler\" from these establishments which holds a half gallon of beer and is a means to buy take-out beer. Besides being a great deal, growlers make a great souvenir. Also, just a short bus ride away is the Woodward Avenue Brewery in Ferndale, take the Smart 450\/460 Direction: Inbound (Runs down South Washington) in Royal Oak to get there.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["drink"],["name=Bastone"],["url=http:\/\/www.bastone.net\/"],["email="],["address=419 S Main St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 248 544-6250"],["tollfree="],["fax=+1 248 544-6254"],["hours=M-Th 11AM-11PM, F-Sa 11AM-12AM, Su 12PM-10PM"],["price="],["content=Award-Winning Beers & Belgian Fries, kids eat free on Sundays."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["drink"],["name=Lily's Seafood Grill & Brewery"],["url=http:\/\/www.lilysseafood.com"],["email="],["address=410 S Washington Ave"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Near 11 Mile Rd"],["phone = +1 248-591-5459"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Happy Hour is on Weekdays 2PM-6PM and Saturday 11AM-6PM with 2 dollar pints of their own beer.

Many strongarm robberies and rape attempts take place in the city's downtown alleyways.

Drug dealers are often present in these types of neighborhood after dark. If you choose to walk through such neighborhoods after dark remember to wear neutral-colored clothing and avoid large groups of people.\n\nIn addition, try not to walk on the Eleven Mile corridor during the night-time outside of the Downtown area as it is where many robberies in the city take place.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Car theft "]},"\nAlways park in a well-lit area during the night time.
