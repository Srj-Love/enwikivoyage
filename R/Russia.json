However it was not considered part of mainstream Europe until the reign of Tsar Peter the Great, who ruled until 1725. He was a dedicated Europhile and the first Tsar to visit 'Europe proper'. \n\nPeter established the Russian Empire in 1721, although the Romanov dynasty had been in power since 1613. One of Russia's most charismatic and forceful leaders, Peter built the foundations of empire on a centralized and authoritarian political culture and forced \"Westernization\" of the nation.  As part of this effort he moved the capital from the medieval and insular city of Moscow to St. Petersburg, a city  built by force of his will and strength of his treasury. Modelled largely on French and Italianate styles, St. Petersburg became known as Russia's \"Window on the West\" and adopted the manners and style of the royal courts of western Europe, to the point of adopting French as its preferred language. \n\nThe Russian Empire reached its peak during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, producing many colourful and enlightened figures such as Catherine the Great, Dostoevsky, and Tolstoy. Nevertheless, the gulf between the authoritarian dynasty and its subjects became more apparent with each generation. By the late 19th century, political crises followed in rapid succession, with rebellion and repression locked a vicious cycle of death and despair. The occasional attempts by the Romanovs and the privileged classes to reform the society and ameliorate the condition of the underclasses invariably ended in failure. Russia entered the World War I in the union of the ",{"type":"''","value":["Triple Entente"]},", like other European Empires with catastrophic results for itself.  Tsar Nicholas II and his wife, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria, proved to be feckless, weak, and distracted by personal tragedies and the burdens of the war.  The government proved unable to hold back the Russian Revolution of 1917.  Deposed and held under house arrest, Nicholas, Alexandra, and their children—and with them the Romanov dynasty—were exterminated by gunfire in the basement of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yekaterinburg"]]}," manor house and buried in unmarked graves which were found after Communism and reburied in the St. Paul and Peter Cathedral in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saint Petersburg"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Headquarters of Communism"]},"\nWorld War I strained Imperial Russia's governmental and social institutions to the breaking point  of Revolution in 1917.  Following a brief interim government headed by social democrat Alexander Kerensky, the Bolshevik faction of the Communist Party under Marxist Vladimir Lenin seized power, withdrew Russia from the war, and launched a purge of clerics, political dissidents, aristocrats, the bourgeoisie, and the kulak class of wealthy independent farming classes. A brutal civil war between the \"Red Army\" of the communist leadership and the \"White Army\" of the nobility and middle classes lasted until late 1920. In his years in power, Lenin used the Red Army, the internal security apparatus, and the Communist Party leadership to exterminate and imprison millions of political opponents, launch a terror campaign to insure strict Communist orthodoxy, secure control over the fragments of the old Romanov Empire, and \"collectivize\" farmers and farming into gigantic state-owned farms. \n\nThe revolutionary state was not directly ruled by the officials in titular control of the government, which was established in the name of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR).  The government in the commonly understood sense was largely irrelevant both in fact and in Communist theory throughout the years of Communist control.  The real power lay in the leadership of the Communist Party, the Red Army, and the internal security apparatus (secret police).    \n\nFollowing Lenin's death in 1924, a power struggle among the Bolshevik leadership ensued, with Josef Stalin emerging as the new leader of the Communist Party and dictator of the USSR. Stalin's brutal rule (1928–53) was marked by waves of \"purges\" in which suspected dissidents in the government, the Party, the Red Army, and even the security forces were executed or exiled to gulags (prison camps) on little or no evidence. In addition to following up Lenin's forced collectivization of agriculture and his destruction of private property and economic liberty, Stalin introduced a ruthless economic system (\"socialism in one country\") that rapidly industrialized the USSR. Stalin's rivals to succeed Lenin, as well as critics arising thereafter, typically ended up as victims of the purges. Although seen as less of an idealist than his predecessor, Stalin did relentlessly pursue international revolution through the Russia-based \"Comintern\" control over the communist parties of foreign countries, and foreign espionage.\n\nWorld War II, from a Soviet perspective, began with Stalin abruptly entering into a Non-Aggression Pact with Nazi Germany.  The Treaty, which shook Western governments to their core and stunned the Left in Europe and America, guaranteed Hitler a free hand to launch war against Poland, France, and England. The Pact also granted the USSR itself leave to invade and conquer neutral Finland and take over all of eastern Poland after the German invasion in 1939.  Finally in June 1941, having conquered France and most of the rest of Western Europe, Hitler turned on his erstwhile ally and invaded the USSR. A change to an alliance of necessity with the Western nations was instrumental in the defeat of Nazism in 1945. The Red Army's bloody campaigns on the Eastern Front, culminating in its capture of Berlin, resulted in over 20 million Russian deaths, most of them civilian victims, or soldiers thrown into ghastly land battles.  \n\nAt the conclusion of the Second World War, the USSR rapidly moved to establish control over all of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Eastern Europe"]]},". It annexed the Baltic states and installed Communist regimes in East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Romania and effectively crushed political dissent. In Asia, it also helped to install communist governments in Mongolia, China, North Vietnam and North Korea. Western critics came to describe the USSR and its European and Asian \"satellites\" as trapped behind an \"Iron Curtain\" of ruthless totalitarianism and command economies. Yugoslavia's Communist Party managed to establish a degree of independence from Moscow, but uprisings in Hungary (1956) and Czechoslovakia (1968) were ruthlessly crushed.  \n\nAfter Stalin's death in 1953, Soviet heavy industry and military might continued to grow under Georgy Malenkov (1953-1955) and Nikita Khrushchev (1955-1964), Stalin's successors as General Secretary of the Party.  Although attempts were made to produce consumer goods, the efforts usually failed, and the USSR continued to struggle under the yoke of collectivization and totalitarianism. In 1956, Khrushchev renounced the excesses of Stalin's regime and commenced his own purge to \"de-Stalinise\" the economy and society of the USSR. Results were mixed, and Khrushchev himself was deposed. In the 1960s, the USSR jump-started the space race and was the first to launch a thing (Sputnik), a living thing (Laika the dog) and a man (Yuri Gagarin) into the space. The Soviet Union's reached its military, diplomatic, and industrial peak during the closing years of Leonid Brezhnev (1964-1982).  But continuing corruption and economic malaise marched inexorably to a crisis that eventually led General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev (1985–91) to introduce glasnost (openness) and perestroika (limited economic freedom).  His initiatives inadvertently released forces that by December 1991 splintered the empire.  The European satellites broke free from rule by the USSR and their local Communist leaders and the USSR itself collapsed into 15 independent countries.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["A Nascent Democracy"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Novgorod millennium 4.jpg"],["thumb"],["330px"],["Novgorod memorial to the Viking Ryurik and the ensuing 1,000 years of Russian history"]]},"\n\nThe Russian Federation emerged from the Soviet Union, accompanied by a storm of problems followed. The first leader of the newly formed nation was Boris Yeltsin, who rose to power by standing up to an attempted putsch by the KGB. Yeltsin largely succeeded in transferring control over the country from the old Soviet elite to his own oligarchical apparatus. Yeltsin was a charismatic leader widely supported by the West, but his government proved to be unstable. A wave of economic hardship put Russia's economy in ruins and left the military underfunded and undisciplined. During this time, Russian organized crime and its relationship with the government, now universally recognized as corrupt and incompetent, assumed greater control over the nation, even as political reforms were taking place. Ironically, before he came to power Yeltsin had labelled Russia as the \"biggest Mafia state in the world\". \n\nRussia was also at war with Chechen separatists, which had devastating consequences for the already weak Russian economy. Widespread corruption, poverty, and large-scale political and social problems, eventually forced to Yeltsin resign, and Vladimir Putin filled his remaining term (January - April 2000) as President.  An ex-KGB officer under the Communist regime, and head of the revived Russian spy service under Yeltsin, Putin imposed his own personality and will on the unruly and criminal quarters of the country, but has been much condemned for his authoritarian behaviour. Having served his constitutionally limited terms (2000-2008), Putin titularly stepped down as President but continued to control the government through his anointed successor, Dmitry Medvedev. To no one's surprise, Putin resumed the presidency when eligible again in 2012.\n\nSince 2000, under Putin's direct and indirect rule, the economy has bounced back from crisis, thanks in no small part to five-fold increases in the prices of raw materials Russia has in abundance. Inflation has dropped down from the triple digits into single units, poverty has been reduced, and Russia has re-emerged as a dominant regional economic, political and military power. This performance has often been called the \"Russian Miracle.\" \n\nToday, the modern Russia still has to fully recover from the doldrums that have hit the country in recent years, with inflation driving up prices, an increasingly unstoppable burden to combat pervasive corruption, an under-competitive political system, conflict in the North Caucasus, a demographic crisis, and decreasing economic competition. Russians also appear to be facing up to the problem of reconciling Putin's successes with his totalitarian and self-aggrandizing impulses. Nonetheless, Russians have achieved a much higher standard of living since the fall of the USSR.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Terrain"]},"\nThe terrain consists of broad plains with low hills west of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Urals"]]},"; vast coniferous forest and tundra in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Siberia"]]},"; uplands and mountains along southern border regions; mountainous and volcanic throughout much of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russian Far East"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nRussia is a cold country, but there are always shades in the grey.

Normally, an exit visa is included in transit, private visit\/homestay, tourist, and business visas so long as the visa is still valid. Other classes, such as student visas, still require a separate exit visa that can take up to three weeks to process.\n\nExit and re-entry during the validity period of your visa requires permits. Getting these permits is a Kafkaesque bureaucratic nightmare that is best avoided entirely by getting a double- or multiple-entry visa in the first place.\n\nIf you're in Russia and have lost your passport, your sponsor, not your embassy, must apply to the Federal Migration Service to transfer your visa to your replacement passport. Having a copy of your old visa helps with this, but is not sufficient to let you depart.\n\nAn unaccompanied minor with  Russian nationality needs, apart from the regular requirements for adults, a notarized statements in Russian signed by both parents.

A tourist invitation gets you a tourist visa, a private visit invitation gets you a private visit visa, etc. Except for tourist visas, invitations are official documents issued by Russian government agencies and must be applied for by the person or organization inviting you.\n\nAny invitation will include the intended dates of travel and the number of entries requires (1, 2 or multiple). The dates on the invitation determine the period of the ensuing visa's validity. If in doubt of dates, ensure that the invitation covers a period longer than the intended stay: a tourist visa valid for 7 days costs the same as one valid for 30 days.\n\nIn the likely situation you have to buy your invitation, shop around globally: all invitations come from Russia and the company that gets it for you will have a base in Russia. It doesn't make a difference whether its website is based in Germany, UK, USA or Swaziland. Many embassies and consulates only require a copy of the invitation, however this is not always the case so check with the embassy or consulate beforehand. If the original invitation is required, it will have to be flown from Russia anyway. It is only applying for the visa itself that generally requires the application to be made in the applicant's homeland.\n\nA ",{"type":"'''","value":["tourist invitation"]}," (also called ",{"type":"'''","value":["reservation confirmation"]},") is a letter of confirmation of booking and pre-payment of accommodation and travel arrangements in Russia. It is accompanied by a ",{"type":"'''","value":["tourist voucher"]},". These two documents can be issued only by \"government approved\" tour operators, hotels, online hotel booking services or Russian travel agencies (several Russian travel agencies have offices outside Russia and are adept at facilitating visa applications). \"Government approval\" here is not an endorsement of quality; it means that the company is registered with the Russian government. ",{"type":"'''","value":["An ordinary hotel booking is not sufficient to constitute an invitation."]}," Some hotels charge a fee to issue the invitation.

While the strict legality of such is questionable, these companies are well established and do enough not to upset the authorities. Most importantly, ",{"type":"'''","value":["their services do not lead to problems for the traveller"]},". However, if your itinerary is confined to only one hotel, then it makes sense to obtain the invitation documents directly from the hotel as the service fee will be similar.\n\nConsider getting a ",{"type":"'''","value":["private\/homestay"]}," visa if you have friends or relatives in Russia (they do not necessarily have to be Russian). They would need to seek an invitation through their local Passport and Visa Division of the Federal Migration Service (formerly OVIR). These invitations tend to take at least a month to process. The inviting individual also becomes solely responsible for all your activities while in Russia and can be penalized heavily if something were to go wrong. Because of this, personal invitations are usually not available for a fee through the net.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Business invitations"]}," are issued by the government. They are generally time-consuming and costly to acquire but they can be quickly arranged for exorbitant fees. Any registered company in Russia can apply for a business invitation.

They may issue visas by mail, they may require application in person, they may accept a copy of the invitation, they may require the original. They may accept payment by card, they may insist on a money order. Check with the embassy or consulate beforehand - in most cases it will be on their website.   Holders of U.S., Canadian, and British passports typically have to complete a longer application. Getting a Russian visa issued away from your country of nationality or one you have a residence permit valid for at least three months can be tricky.

For citizens of the USA the price is, at the present, USD140 (USD150 for multiple-entry visas), with standard processing being at least 4 working days (express service is USD250 and stated to be 3 working days).\n\nIn some countries which have a busy trade in Russian visas (eg, UK and USA), the visa processing has been outsourced to private companies.

Take as an example a UK citizen applying for a 30 day, single entry tourist visa with standard processing in the UK (not the cheapest example and not the most expensive): invitation bought through an agency: GBP15, visa fee: GBP50, application fee: GBP26.40 = GBP91.40 (that's roughly USD140).\n\nTourist, homestay, and transit visas can allow one or two entries. Tourist and homestay visas have a maximum validity of 30 days. Transit visas are typically for one to three days for air travel and up to ten days for overland journeys. Business and other visa categories can be issued for one, two or multiple entries.\n\nAny business visa can permit a maximum stay in any one visit of up to 90 days. However, a business visa only permits a total stay of ",{"type":"'''","value":["90 days in Russia in a 180-day period"]},", regardless of how long it is valid for (whether it be 3, 6, or 12 months). If you stay in Russia for 90 days, you have to leave and your visa will not permit you to return for another 90 days. This means (give or take - a year isn't 360 days) that a six month visa permits as long a total time in Russia as a three month visa! \n\nOnce you have your visa, check all the dates and information as it's much easier to correct mistakes before you travel than after you arrive!\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Visa free entry by ship"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Boarding StPeter Line.JPG"],["thumbnail"],["For instance St.Petersburg can be visited visa free if you arrive and leave by boat"]]},"\nThere is an exception for some cruise passengers, arriving in and leaving from Russia by boat.

Upon leaving Russia, a lost landing card may be overlooked with the help of a nominal fine.\n\nUsually, you will be permitted to enter and remain in Russia for the term of your visa but it's up to the immigration officer to decide and they may decide otherwise, though this is unlikely.\n\nThose who enter Russia with valuable electronic items or musical instruments (especially violins that look antique and expensive), antiques, large amounts of currency, or other such items are required to declare them on the customs entry card and must insist on having the card stamped by a customs officer upon arrival. Even if the customs officer claims that it is not necessary to declare such items, insist on a stamp on your declaration.

Cancellations occur everywhere over the country, except commuter zones of largest cities, such as Moscow, Saint-Petersburg, Ekaterinburg and Irkutsk. Having latest news on cancellations may be essential for trip planning. Typical cancellation traits: most cancellations occur in the start of the year, sometimes some trains are returned into timetable, if local budgets find funds to sponsor them; some trains are cut at region borders, even when there are no roads over the border to the previous train destination; other local trains got cut to 1 a day or several a week, often with timetable, not convenient for tourists.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Tickets"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Russian train ticket.jpg"],["250px"],["thumb"],["Russian train ticket with fields description"]]},"\n\nBecause virtually all long-distance trains are overnight, the long-distance tickets are bound to specified train.

Lines vary widely – some stations are much better organized than others nowadays, and it also depends on the season. If you find the lines unbearably long, it's usually not hard to find an agency that sells train tickets. Commission rates are generally not prohibitive. For instance, buying your ticket to Saint Petersburg from Moscow, it is much better to walk a flight of steps from the ordinary ticketing office – there are no queues upstairs and R140 is a small premium to pay for this service.\n\nAlternatively you can buy an e-ticket online on Russian Railways website ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/ticket.rzd.ru\/"]}," (Russian), ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/pass.rzd.ru\/main-pass\/public\/en"]}," (English version). You should take the printed e-ticket at station counter before boarding and pick up a regular ticket, or you can choose the so-called \"electronic registration\" on the site, after which you will have to print the e-ticket and come with it and with your passort right to the train.\n\nThere are many agencies selling Russian train tickets abroad – RealRussia ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.realrussia.co.uk"]},", RussianTrains ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/russiantrains.com"]}," or RussianTrain ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/russiantrain.com"]},".

This does not apply for ticket from abroad to Russia – you have to buy the ticket at railway company of the departure country.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Travel tips"]},"\n\nTravel time can vary from several hours to several days. Note that there are more types of train between the two capitals than between any other two cities in Russia. Apart from ordinary trains, there are rapid trains (",{"type":"''","value":["Sapsan"]},") that run by day only and cover the 650 km between Moscow and Saint Petersburg in 4 hours. Some of the overnight trains are quite luxurious — these include the traditional ",{"type":"''","value":["The Red Arrow"]}," service and the newer, fake-Czarist-era ",{"type":"''","value":["Nikolaevsky Express"]},", complete with attendants in 19-century uniforms. Sheets, towels and prepacked breakfasts are included in all the better trains. Shared bathroom facilities are located at the end of the train car. There are special hatches that one may use to secure the door of the compartment from the inside during the night.\n\nMoscow-Saint Petersburg Express Train takes 5 hours of travel and costs 2400 rubles.  Trains are only slightly air conditioned. No one in the Moscow train station speaks any English, so if you are not familiar enough with Russian to purchase your train ticket in person, it is suggested that you purchase online or through your hotel concierge or travel agent before you depart.  Also, note that all signage inside the train station is in Russian only, so finding your correct platform can be challenging.  The dining car of the express train is nicely appointed with real table linens, and an impressive menu and wine list, but is 3 to 4 times more expensive than eating in the city before and after you travel.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Lipetsk bus stop.jpg"],["thumb"],["270px"],["Bus stop in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lipetsk"]]}]]},"\n\nTrains stop at stations for long time, about 15–20 minutes. Check the timetable placed on door at the end of corridor. During stop you can buy various meals and drinks at platform from locals for pretty reasonable prices. Frequently, traders will walk through the cars between stops and sell everything from crockery to clothes to Lay's chips.\n\nThe commuter trains are mostly hard-seat train cars. You don't get a designated seat number — you just find space on a bench. These trains have a notorious reputation for being overcrowded, though this has declined somewhat. The trains make very frequent stops and are rather slow. For example, a 200 km trip to Vladimir takes about 3 h 30 min . They do (!) have toilets in the first and the last cars but it is going to be an unforgettable experience (use them in \"emergency\" cases only).\n\nTickets for commuter trains are sold in a separate room from the long-distance trains, and are sometimes sold from stalls located outside.\n\nA few very popular routes, mostly between Moscow and nearby cities such as Vladimir, Yaroslavl, Tula, and others have an express commuter train that is considerably more comfortable. Your ticket will have a designated seat number and the seats are reasonably comfortable. The trains travel to their destination directly and are thus considerably faster.\n\nNote that all long-distance trains in Russia run on Moscow time (which may be up to 9 hours off local time in the Far East).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nMost Russian cities have bus links to cities as far as 5–6 hours away or further.  Though generally less comfortable than the train, buses sometimes are a better option time-wise and are worth looking into if the train timetables don't suit you.  A small number of cities, notably ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Suzdal"]]},", are not served by train, and thus bus is the only option besides a car.\n\nThe Russian word for bus station is Avtovokzal (Ahv-tuh-vahg-ZAHL).  Most cities have just one for long distance buses and the state buses depart from there.  However, in Moscow and in some other Russian cities, a number of commercial buses are available, and they generally don't depart from the bus station.  Quite often, you'll see commercial buses near train stations.  Sometimes they run on schedules, though for popular routes (such as Moscow-Vladimir, Moscow\/Yaroslavl, etc.) the buses simply wait to fill up.  On these buses payment is usually to the driver.\n\nRussian buses have luggage storage, but if it's an old Eastern-bloc bus, you may find your luggage wet at the end of the trip.\n\n",{"type":"=====","value":["Marshrutka"]},"\nApart from regular buses there are private minibuses called ",{"type":"''","value":["marshrutka"]}," (маршрутка). These emerged after the fall of the Soviet Union as an alternative to the moribund public transport system. Legally, they may be licensed as either taxis or buses. They have fixed routes, but usually no timetables and no regular stations. The official designation for them is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Route Taxi"]},", (Russian: marshrutnoye taxi, Ukrainian: marshrutne taxi), hence the colloquial marshrutka).\n\nTo board one of these, stop at the roadside and wave a hand, if you are lucky and the minibus isn't full, it will stop. In a city, it will stop anyway and offer you an option to stand in the aisle or even stand in some corner bending over sitting passengers. This is neither legal nor convenient, but very common and acceptable. You can arrange with the driver to stop at your destination. Normally, you just shout \"Stop here, please\", and marshrutka will stop pretty much anywhere, even in the middle of the traffic without moving to the side of the road. At main stops the driver may wait and collect more passengers. The waiting time is unpredictable and depends on the schedule, number of passengers, competing buses, etc. There are no tickets, you pay the driver directly. He may give you a receipt, but you have to ask for it explicitly.\n\nMarshrutkas ride both in the countryside (in this case they are more likely to have timetables) and as city transport. Sometimes they look like regular buses, which makes them hardly distinguishable from official buses. Moreover, on long-distance routes you have an option of reserving a place by phone and even buying a ticket in advance. The system is very haphazard and organized in the most odd manner. It is highly advisable to check details about particular route with drivers or at least with locals who should know the current situation in their city. In cities, never rely on the route numbers. Sometimes they match those of the official public transport, but sometimes they don't.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nThe tremendous distances of Russia make plane travel highly desirable if you plan to travel to some of Russia's more far-flung attractions.  It's worth considering for any destination that is farther than an overnight train ride.  Travelling across Russia by train can sound awfully romantic, but it's also time-consuming and rather monotonous.  Nearly every major destination of interest has an airport nearby.  The great majority of domestic flights are to\/from Moscow, but other services exist.\n\nThe Russian domestic airline industry had an abominable reputation in the 90s due to uncertain safety records, unreliable timetables, terrible service, uncomfortable airplanes, and substandard airports.  Substantial improvements have been made, however.

Russians are proud of their culturally diverse language. The language is a member of the Slavic language family, with the minor exception being that it is further sub-classified into the East Slavic family, thus being closely related to Ukrainian and Belarusian. Although related to other Slavic languages such as Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, to name a few, they are not mutually intelligible, but still share a slight similarity. Russian is considered one of the most difficult languages for an English speaker to learn, mostly because of a very complicated grammar. However, it is less difficult to learn than its other language neighbors, Ukrainian and Belarusian.  You will not learn the language in a short time; concentrate on learning some key ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russian phrasebook"],["\"courtesy\" phrases"]]},", and the Cyrillic alphabet (e.g. \"ресторан\" spells \"restoran\" in the Roman alphabet, which means \"restaurant\") so you have a chance to recognize street names, labels and public signs. Familiarizing yourself with Cyrillic is immensely helpful, not only for Russia but for a number of other countries as well, and not very difficult.\n\nLearning Russian is quite hard going, despite Russian sharing an ancestral Indo-European root language with English. The script, Cyrillic, uses many letters of the Latin alphabet but assigns many of them different sounds. The language employs three grammatical genders (masculine, feminine and neuter), six grammatical cases, and free-fall stress, all of which conspire to make it a difficult prospect for the native English speaker. \n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Свято-Троицкая Сергиева Лавра.JPG"],["thumb"],["340px"],["Trinity Monastery in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sergiev Posad"]]},"—the spiritual home of the Russian Orthodox Church"]]},"\n\nEnglish is becoming a requirement in the business world, and many younger Russians in the cities (particularly Moscow or St. Petersburg but also elsewhere) know enough English to communicate. Elsewhere English is generally nonexistent, so take a phrase book and be prepared for slow communication with a lot of interpretive gestures.\n\nRussia has hundreds of languages and claims to support most of them. Soviet linguists documented them in the first few decades of the USSR and made sure they were given Cyrillic writing systems (except Karelian, Veps, Ingrian, Votic and Ter Sami). Some were made local co-official languages. Southern Russia is lined with Turkic, Mongolian, and Tungusic language; the northern with Finnic and Samoyed tongues. The southwest corner has a variety of Caucasian languages; the northeast has a few Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages. However, a smattering of Russian is will greatly aid travellers no matter where they are.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox religion is one of the oldest branches of Christianity in the world and continues to have a very large following, despite having been repressed during the communist period.

Mass industrialization programs came with a new aesthetic ethos which emphasized functionality (combined with grandiosity).

It did, however, lead to the construction of monuments to the war throughout the entire country.

Equally impressive is the edifice housing the collection on display, the magnificent Winter Palace of the Romanov Dynasty. Saint Petersburg's often overlooked Russian Museum should also be a priority, as it has the country's second best collection of purely Russian art, from icons of the tenth century on through the modern movements, in all of which revolutionary Russia led the charge ahead of the rest of the world. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]},"'s art museums, only slightly less well known, include the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Tretyakov Gallery"]}," (the premiere collection of Russian art) and the Pushkin Museum of Western Art.\n\nOther museum exhibitions certainly worth seeking out are the collections of ",{"type":"'''","value":["antiquities"]}," in Saint Petersburg and Moscow, particularly at the Hermitage Museum, and the Armory in the Moscow Kremlin. For military buffs, Russian ",{"type":"'''","value":["military museums"]}," are often fantastic, truly best-in-the-world, regardless of whether you are at one of the main ones in the Moscow—the Central Armed Forces Museum, Kubinka Tank Museum, Central Air Force Museum, Museum of the Great Patriotic War (WWII), or way off in the provinces. The other category in which Russian museums outshine the rest of the world would be within the ",{"type":"'''","value":["literary"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["musical"]}," spheres. Nary a town visited, if only for a day, by Alexander Pushkin is without some small museum dedicated to his life and works.

For classical music lovers, the apartment museums of various nineteenth and century composers in Saint Petersburg are worth more than just nostalgic wanderings—they often have small performances by incredible musicians.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Кул шариф 4.jpg"],["thumb"],["290px"],[{"type":"[[","value":[["Kazan"]]},"'s Qolşärif Mosque"]]},"\n\nAll tourists in Russia find themselves looking at a lot of churches. Ecclesiastical architecture is a significant source of pride among Russians, and the onion dome is without question a preeminent national symbol. The twentieth century, sadly, saw cultural vandalism in the destruction of said architecture on an unprecedented scale. But the immense number of beautiful old monasteries and churches ensured that an enormous collection remains. The best known, as usual, are in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saint Petersburg"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]},", in particular the old baroque Church on the Spilled Blood, Alexander Nevsky Lavra, and the monumental Kazan and Saint Isaac's Cathedrals in the former, and Saint Basil's Cathedral and the massive Church of the Annunciation in the latter.

Its foundations were laid by the peasant food of the rural population in an often harsh climate, with a combination of plentiful fish, poultry, game, mushrooms, berries, and honey. Crops of rye, wheat, buckwheat, barley, and millet provided the ingredients for a plethora of breads, pancakes, cereals, kvass, beer, and vodka. Flavourful soups and stews centred on seasonal or storable produce, fish, and meats. This wholly native food remained the staples for the vast majority of Russians well into the 20th century. Lying on the northern reaches of the ancient Silk Road, as well as Russia's proximity to the Caucasus, Persia, and the Ottoman Empire has provided an inescapable Eastern character to its cooking methods (not so much in European Russia but distinguishable in the North Caucasus). Russia's renowned caviar is easily obtained, however prices can exceed the expenses of your entire trip. Dishes such as beef Stroganov and chicken kiev, from the pre-revolutionary era are available but mainly aimed at tourists as they lost their status and visibility during Soviet times.  \nRussian specialities include:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"''","value":["Ikra"]}," (sturgeon or salmon caviar)"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"''","value":["Pelmeni"]}," (meat-filled dumplings, similar to pot-stickers, especially popular in Ural and Siberian regions)"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"''","value":["Blini"]}," (thin white flour or buckwheat pancakes, similar to French crepes)"]},{"type":"*","value":["Black bread (rye bread, somewhat similar to one used by North American delis and not as dense as German variety)"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"''","value":["Piroshki"]}," (aka ",{"type":"''","value":["Belyashi"]}," - small pies or buns with sweet or savoury filling)"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"''","value":["Golubtsy"]}," (Cabbage rolls)"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"''","value":["Ikra Baklazhanaya"]}," (aubergine spread)"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"''","value":["Okroshka"]}," (Cold soups based on kvass or sour milk)"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"''","value":["Schi"]}," (cabbage soup) and Green schi (sorrel soup, may be served cold)"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"''","value":["Borsch"]}," (Ukrainian beet and cabbage soup)"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"''","value":["Vinegret"]}," (salad of boiled beets, eggs, potato, carrots, pickles and other vegetables with vinegar, mustard, vegetable oil and\/or mayonnaise)"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"''","value":["Olivier"]}," (Russian version of potato salad with peas, meat, eggs, carrots, and pickles)"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"''","value":["Shashlyk"]}," (various kebabs from the Caucasus republics of the former Soviet Union)"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"''","value":["Seledka pod shuboy"]}," (fresh salted herring with \"vinegret\")"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"''","value":["Kholodets"]}," (aka ",{"type":"''","value":["Studen'"]}," - meat, garlic and carrots in meat aspic)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"''","value":["Kvass"]},"  (a fermented thirst-quenching beverage made from rye bread, sugar and yeast, similar to young low-alcohol beer)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"''","value":["Limonad"]}," (various soft drinks)"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Troika Pelmeni.JPG"],["thumb"],["280px"],[{"type":"''","value":["Pelmeni"]}," meat dumplings with three dipping sauces"]]},"\n\nBoth Saint Petersburg and Moscow offer sophisticated, world class dining and a wide variety of cuisines including Japanese, Tibetan and Italian. They are also excellent cities to sample some of the best cuisines of the former Soviet Union (e.g., Georgian and Uzbek). It is also possible to eat well and cheaply there without resorting to the many western fast food chains that have opened up. Russians have their own versions of fast food restaurants which range from cafeteria style serving comfort foods to streetside kiosks cooking up blinis,  shawerma\/gyros, piroshki\/belyashi, stuffed potatoes, etc. Although their menus may not be in English, it is fairly easy to point to what is wanted — or at a picture of it, not unlike at western fast food restaurants. A small Russian dictionary will be useful at non- touristy restaurants offering table service where staff members will not speak English and the menus will be entirely in Cyrillic, but prices are very reasonable. Russian meat soups and meat pies are excellent. \n\nIt is better not to drink the tap water in Russia and to avoid using ice in drinks, however bottled water, kvass, limonad, and Coca Cola are available everywhere food is served.\n\nStylish cafes serving cappuccino, espresso, toasted sandwiches, rich cakes and pastries are popping up all over Saint Petersburg and Moscow. Some do double duty as wine bars, others are also internet cafes.\n\nUnlike the United States, cafes in Russia (кафе) serve not only drinks, but also a full range of meals (typically cooked in advance—unlike restaurants where part or whole cooking cycle is performed after you make an order).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nVodka, imported liquors (rum, gin, etc.), international soft-drinks (Pepsi, Coca- Cola, Fanta, etc.), local soft drinks (Tarhun, Buratino, Baikal, etc.), distilled water, kvas (sour-sweet non-alcoholic naturally carbonized drink made from fermented dark bread) and mors (traditional wild berry drink).  \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Beer"]}," (пиво) Russia is cheap in and the varieties are endless of both Russian and international brands. It is found for sale at any street vendor (warm) or stall (varies) in the centre of any city and costs (costs double and triple the closer you are to the centre) from about RUB17 (about USD0.50) to RUB130 for a 0.5 L bottle or can. \"Small\" bottles and cans (0.33 L and abount) are also widely sold, and there are also plastic bottles of 1, 1.5, 2 litres or even more, similar to those in which soft carbonated drinks are usually sold — many cheaper beers are sold that way and, being even cheaper due to large volume, are quite popular, despite some people say it can have a \"plastic\" taste. Corner stores\/cafés, selling draft beer (highly recommended) also exist, but you have to seek them out. The highest prices (especially in the bars and restaurants) are traditionally in Moscow; Saint-Petersburg, on the other hand, is known for the cheaper and often better beers. Smaller cities and towns generally have similar prices if bought in the shop, but significantly lower ones in the bars and street cafes. Popular local brands of beer are Baltika, Stary Mel'nik, Bochkareff, Zolotaya Bochka, Tin'koff and many others. Locally made (mainly except some Czech and possibly some other European beers — you won't miss these, the price of a \"local\" Czech beer from the same shelf will be quite different) international trademarks like Holsten, Carlsberg, etc. are also widely available, but their quality doesn't differ so much from local beers. Soft drinks usually start from RUB20-30 (yes, same or even more expensive than an average local beer in a same shop) and can cost up to RUB60 or more in the Moscow center for a 0.5 L plastic bottle or 0.33 L can.\n\nCheap beer (less than RUB50 per 0.5 L) may not contain natural ingredients at all and can cause an allergic reaction.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Russian Standard and Zelyonaya Marka.jpg"],["thumb"],["350px"],["High quality and popular domestic vodkas on the table: Russian Standard and Zelyonaya Marka"]]},"\n\nStreet vendors usually operate mainly in tourist- and local-frequented areas, and many of them (especially those who walk around without a stall) are working without a license, usually paying some kind of a bribe to local police. Their beer, however, is usually OK, as it was just bought in a nearby shop. In the less weekend-oriented locations, large booths (\"lar'ki\" or \"palatki\", singular: \"laryok\" (\"stall\") or \"palatka\" (literally, \"tent\")) can be found everywhere, especially near metro stations and bus stops. They sell soft drinks, beer, and \"cocktails\" (basically a cheap soft drink mixed with alcohol, a bad hangover is guaranteed from the cheaper ones. Many of these alcohol cocktails contain taurine and large doses of caffeine and are popular with the nightlife fans) and their prices, while still not high, are often 20-40% more than those in supermarkets. The chain supermarkets (excluding some \"elite\" ones) and malls (mostly on bigger cities' outskirts) are usually the cheapest option for buying drinks (for food, the local markets in the smaller cities, but not in Moscow, are often cheaper). Staff of all of these (maybe except in some supermarkets, if you're lucky) do not speak or, at the best, speak very basic English even in Moscow. And furthermore, staff of many markets in Moscow and other large cities speak very basic Russian (its mainly migrants from Middle Asia). \n\nMixed alcoholic beverages as well as beers at nightclubs and bars are extremely expensive and are served without ice, with the mix (for example, coke) and alcohol charged for separately. Bringing your own is neither encouraged nor allowed, and some (usually dance-all-night venues oriented to the young crowd) places in Moscow even can take some measures to prevent customers from drinking outside (like a face-control who may refuse an entry on return, or the need to pay entry fee again after going out), or even from drinking the tap water instead of overpriced soft drinks by leaving only hot water available in the lavatories. Any illegal drugs are best avoided by the people not accustomed to the country — the enforcement is, in practice, focused on collecting more bribes from those buying and taking, rather than on busting drug-dealers, the people selling recreational illegal drugs in the clubs are too often linked with (or watched by) police; plain-clothes policemen know and frequently visit the venues where drugs are popular, and you will likely end up in a lot of problems with notoriously corrupt Russian police and probably paying multi-thousand-dollar (if not worse) bribe to get out, if you'll get caught. It really doesn't worth the risk here.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Wines"]}," (вино) from Georgia, Crimea and Moldova are quite popular (although all products from Georgia are illegal 2005). In Moscow and Saint Petersburg, most restaurants have a selection of European wines—generally at a high price. Please note that Russians prefer sweet wine as opposed to dry.  French Chablis is widely available at restaurants and is of good quality.  The Chablis runs about 240 rubles per glass.  All white wines are served room temperature unless you are at an international hotel that caters to Westerners. \n\nSoviet ",{"type":"'''","value":["champagne"]}," (Советское Шампанское, ",{"type":"''","value":["Sovetskoye Shampanskoye"]},") or, more politically correctly, just sparkling wine (Игристые вина, ",{"type":"''","value":["Igristie vina"]},") is also served everywhere in the former Soviet Union at a reasonable price.

The quality of the cheapest ones (from RUB85-120, depending on where you buy) varies, with some local Moscow and St. Petersburg brands (produced out of Crimean and southern Russian grapes) being quite good. You can buy if you do want to have a try while not paying much, but it's wiser to stick to something better.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Koeningsburg-097.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["How it should be: a Soviet-made bochka dispensing kvass on a hot day in Kaliningrad"]]},"\n\nGood genuine ",{"type":"'''","value":["kvass"]}," (квас) is hard to find in the cities, there are only some chances in rural areas—but even there, only by a recommendation. Whatever is sold in supermarkets as kvass is merely an imitation, and is pretty far from a real product. What makes genuine kvass different includes: limited lifetime (normally 1 week), contains some alcohol (0.7% to 2.6% vol) and should be stored in a fridge. Genuine kvass can be bought in 0.2 L cups, which may be a good idea to sample it before buying in quantity. \n\nIn warm periods, genuine kvass can be bought from huge metal barrels on trailers (",{"type":"''","value":["bochka"]},"s). Originally a symbol of soviet summertime, bochkas became rare after 1991. Soviet nostalgia and these trailers' no-nonsense good functionality have given them a revival in recent years.

Even for a local, it's quite a problem to find a good hotel without a recommendation from a trusted person. For the same reason, it may be really hard to find a hotel during mass tourist-oriented events like StPete anniversary. \n\nHotels in Russia may be quite expensive in metropolises and touristy areas. If you do speak a bit of Russian and are not entirely culture shocked, it is much smarter to seek out and rent a room in a private residence. Most Russians are looking to make extra money and, having space to spare, will rent it out to a tourist gladly. Native Moscovites or residents of Saint Petersburg would rather rent out to tourists than their own countrymen: foreigners are considered more trustworthy and orderly. Expect to pay 60-70 USD a night (usually with breakfast prepared by your host), and the accommodations will certainly be very clean and proper if not modern. When it comes to home\/family life, Russian culture is very warm and inviting.\n\nAnother useful option is short-term apartment rental offered by small companies or individuals. This means that certain flats in regular living buildings are permanently rented out on a daily basis. The flats may differ in their location and quality (from old-fashioned to recently renovated), but in any case you get a one- or two-room apartment with own kitchen, toilet, and bath. Additionally, the hosts provide bed linen as well as cups, plates, and other kitchen equipment. The apartment rental provides  great autonomy and flexibility (e.g., there is no strict check-out time). On the other hand, you do not get certain hotel facilities, such as breakfast, laundry service, etc. The price for the daily apartment rental normally does not exceed the price for the hotel of similar quality, so it is a very useful options, especially in large cities. The negotiations are usually quite official: the host collects the data from your ID, while you get a bill and a rental agreement.\n\nA new phenomenon has been the development of \"mini-hotels\" in large Russian cities. Such hotels usually (but not necessarily!) provide clean modern rooms with private baths at far lower costs than conventional large hotels, approximately $60 vs. well over $150. These small hotels are located within existing apartment buildings and include one, two, or more floors located a story or two above street level. They also often serve breakfast. Saint Petersburg has quite a few with more opening all of the time and some are appearing in Moscow.\n\nCouchsurfing is very popular in Russian cities.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Learn"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Moscowstate250.jpg"],["thumb"],["350px"],["The Moscow State University mammoth, one of the \"severn sisters\".

Assault, robbery, or pickpockets are the most commonly done crimes and they are more common in underground walkways and the subway, overnight trains, train stations, airports, markets, tourist attractions, and restaurants. Foreigners who have been drinking alcohol are especially vulnerable to assault and robbery in or around nightclubs or bars, or on their way home.  Some travelers have been drugged at bars, while others have taken strangers back to their lodgings, where they were drugged, robbed and\/or assaulted. Of significant notation is that Nightclubs are vulnerable to acts of spiking drinks. The drug called GHB is gaining popularity in nightclubs, and it has been proven that  this drug can knock you unconscious, give you amnesia, and can even kill you. Typically it’s in the form of a capful of liquid mixed with a beverage.\n\nBogus trolley inspectors, whose aim is to extort a bribe from individuals while checking for trolley tickets, are also a threat. The use of unmarked taxis is also a problem, as passengers have been victims of robbery, kidnapping, extortion, and theft.  Although there are few registered taxi services in Russia, you should always use authorized services when arriving at a major airport, and it is best to ask which is registered before moving along.\n\nRussia's law enforcement are well-trained and are extremely professional in their jobs. Although being historically very inadequate since the Soviet Union' breakup, the government has fought police corruption fiercely with success. Policemen should not dare to bribe anyone, as they themselves will end up being fined huge amounts. While there is an ongoing effort to shape up the police force initiated by the government, some policemen still remain underpaid, and therefore corrupt. \n\nIf you intend to take a stroll during the night, have someone to accompany you — going alone can only make you a target for corrupt officials and maybe criminals.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" North Caucasus "]},"\nAs a tourist, you are strongly discouraged to travel to the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Caucasus"]]},", as that region is the most dangerous in the entire country.

Drivers attack their art with an equal mix of aggressiveness and incompetence.  Guidelines are lax and rarely followed. As a pedestrian, take great care when crossing the roads, as pedestrian crossings are widely ignored. Most drivers are not very well trained and forged their licenses to avoid problems with the police. More importantly, the rapidly expanding economy has led to an increase in traffic density.

In such a situation, instead of showing weakness, just give the offenders a stiff shove and perhaps a few choice words in Russian and they will look for easier targets.

Many of these crimes are committed by Neo-Nazis and skinheads in groups, though one may encounter non-violent racism by individuals throughout the country. The bulk of attacks tend to take place in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Voronezh.

Formally, arbitrary document checks are not permitted. They do still happen, though with far less frequency than previously, especially in the larger cities. Document checks are now more likely in places with little tourism - some police officers have very narrow notions of what should be appropriate for tourists.\n\nHaving no documents can lead to being held for up to 3h but not arrested. The detention should not be behind bars and you should not be deprived of your belongings (such as mobile phone): you can be taken to a police station, where you will end up sitting on a chair in a normal room while police \"identify\" you, but again, this rarely happens. Like most countries, you can be arrested if you are suspected of having committed a crime, but being unable to provide ID is not a crime and carries no penalty. No physical force can used in the detention, unless you apply it first. If you are stopped, be confident and remember that police officers are forbidden from shouting at you. The passport checks that do happen are primarily targeted at darker skinned people who are suspected of being illegal immigrants. Western-looking, Caucasian people are very rarely asked on the street for ID. \n\nTo spare yourself of potential problems, you may choose to carry your passport, migration card and registration slip on you. If you do, keep a separate photocopy just in case. \n\nBeing stopped for ID is not necessarily a pretext for a bribe. Normally a police officer will salute and ask for your passport (listen out for words like 'paspart', 'veeza' or 'dokumenty'). Hand these to them, they will look at them, hand them back and salute you. While generally an unnerving experience for first time tourists, there is nothing sinister in this.\n\nA corrupt policeman may claim that there are problems with your documentation (passport, immigrations card and residence registration), and demand a fine (bribe). You have three options: you may in a nice, friendly and firm manner explain that actually everything is fine, there is no problem with your documents and you are willing to go to the police station to clear things up; you can pay (RUB300 should be enough in metropolitan areas); threaten. The first option is difficult without some Russian proficiency (and solid nerves), but will generally work. The second option buys you peace but encourages further corruption.
