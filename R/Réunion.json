From then on, the track goes on through a more lunar-like landscape, and the long ascent begins, crossing more recently produced lava.\n\nGetting one’s bearings is no problem, all you have to do is follow the throngs of fellow visitors. Nevertheless, be warned: drink lots and do not be deceived by the cool air at this altitude of 2200m. The sun, even through mist, is very strong, so protect your head and use suncream sparingly all over all parts of your body exposed to the sun (including your legs). Otherwise, be prepared for a few difficult days of sunburn. \nAfter the 2 hours of walking from the car park, you will finally arrive (about a third of the way along the route) at the summit of the Bory crater, at 2631 metres above sea level. This small crater, only 350 metres in diameter, has been inactive since 1971. It’s an ideal place to take a few photos or videos to immortalise the moment.\nStill following the white markers, the walk continues towards the Dolomieu crater (1km in diameter), which is still active, as the fumes will remind you.\nThis itinerary covers the crater, and the route traverses recent lava flows. You’ll certainly feel the heat on your legs and the crunching underfoot (as if you’re walking on pieces of glass). A few signposts remind you of the danger of climbing down the rock face to get closer to the crater.
