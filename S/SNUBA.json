Snuba is a portmanteau of the words 'snorkel' and 'scuba', sometimes used as a generic term for recreational airline diving.\nSNUBA® is the registered trade name of SNUBA International, Inc., and is only authorized for use by license SNUBA Recreational Centers. ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.snuba.com\/"]},"  \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Snubadiving.jpg"],["thumb"],["400px"],["SNUBA® diver ascending to his float"]]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nSnuba combines what is easy about snorkeling with the experience of breathing underwater like scuba, and does so in a controlled, relatively safe manner.\n\nThe commonly used system uses a floating raft, which acts as a platform (almost like the side of a pool) that users can hold onto to practice breathing with their heads underwater and also practice some of the safety measures that the guides will demonstrate. The raft is designed to be highly visible to boat traffic to reduce the chance of being struck by a boat while on the surface.\n\nThe air lines limit the depth of the activity to a maximum depth of 7 meters. The air lines also act as a personal descent line to allow users to easily control their descents and remain at exact depths to equalize their ears. To return to the surface the user simply uses a hand-over-hand to ascend the air line to the surface, which brings them back to the raft. The air line provides users with tremendous vertical control to hold at any depth they feel most comfortable, or should there be coral or other object beneath them. It is not possible for you to get lost.\n\nLightweight harnesses allows more people to experience breathing underwater. The harness eliminates the need to wear, and learn how to use, a BCD (Buoyancy Compensation Device)and Air Cylinder, which combined together are extremely heavy out of the water. This opens this activity up to persons who have weak knees, bad backs, are overweight, older, younger, and even some with disabilities.\n\nSoft weightbelts are used to make participants neutrally buoyant in the water. Soft weights are used to avoid injuries to feet on the surface if dropped and are less likely to damage the reef.\n\nThe use of a regulator eliminates the entry of water if used as instructed. Compared to snorkeling where many participants get a few tastes of the ocean or have difficulty clearing the snorkel.\n\nSnuba is also popular because no prior dive experience is necessary. Participants need only to be at least eight years of age and have a basic swimming ability. Its popularity as a first timer's experience can be attributed to several factors.\n\n#The participant tows the raft on the surface via a lightweight harness connected to the air line. This gives the customer the secure knowledge that he\/she cannot descend too deep and allows them to choose the depth that they feel most comfortable with while being able to control their depth, descent and ascent rates. By using the hose as a guide and wearing weights to achieve neutral buoyancy, participants are able to descend anywhere from just under the surface to 6 metres (20 ft) deep. \n#Participants are able to hold onto the raft at the surface using a grab-rope that runs the length of the raft on both sides. This also allows the user to hold onto the raft while getting comfortable breathing before beginning to descend. Being connected to the raft also provides users with a feeling of safety, comfort, and the option to hold onto the raft should they want to return to the surface. \n#Compared to Scuba, Snuba divers wear minimal gear. Each diver is equipped with a mask, fins, weight belt, harness and regulator. The harness holds the regulator and air line in place, allowing the diver to swim relatively unencumbered beneath the surface. This may be compared to full SCUBA gear, which includes a buoyancy compensator, weights, cylinder and often more, and can weigh in excess of 27 kilograms (60 lb) when out of the water. Although SCUBA equipment is nearly weightless underwater, out of the water the weight becomes a significant factor for weaker individuals. \n#Although the Snuba diver is not provided with any emergency buoyancy system, a correctly weighted snuba diver will be neutrally buoyant at all depths (no compressable dive suit), has a hose and harness to prevent sinking, can pull on the hose to surface, which is less effort than swimming, and has a raft with a grab-rope to hold onto at the surface. This is less versatile than a buoyancy compensator, but far easier to learn, and there is less that can go wrong due to incorrect procedures and equipment failure.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Destinations"]},"\n\nTropical islands and beaches are one of the most popular travel destinations.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Asia"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Phuket"]]}," in Southern ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Thailand"]]}," — The islands surrounding Phuket have great coral reefs that are in the perfect depth range for SNUBA diving.

Snuba tours from beaches generally visit reefs that are just offshore of some of the worlds major tourist destinations. Beach dives are often much cheaper as they do not include transportaion and boat costs. A beach dive is good if the diver does not have a whole or a half day to commit to a boat tour. A Snuba dive from the beach will usually take approximately 1 hour to 1 1\/2 hours including the safety briefing, gear preparation, Snuba underwater tour, and debriefing.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Boat"]},"\nUsually presented as full or half day tours, Snuba boat dives are able to visit islands and reefs that are further afield. Getting further away from the beaches often presents clearer water and less crowds. Many Snuba boat dives are offered as an add-on to snorkeling tours for those that want to get closer to the marine life. \nBoat dives can be done from speedboats, which get divers to the reefs quickly and also have shallow drafts allowing the boats to drop guests on deserted beaches and do more exploring. Large boats and catamarans offer more room to spread out and relax. Lunch is usually served on board large boats and the usual procedure is to spend the whole day on the water with no land stops.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Work"]},"\nAll official SNUBA® Guides are experienced licensed diving professionals. Before training to become a SNUBA® Guide experience and training to top levels of a recognized diving organization (PADI, Naui, SSI, etc.) is required. Snuba guides are chosen based on their diving experience, safety, and professionalism. Each Snuba guide should have received an additional level of training on the use, safety, and guidance of Snuba underwater tours. All official SNUBA® Guides are licensed and insured members of SNUBA International, Inc.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nSnuba diving is NOT dive training. Before attempting to scuba dive on ones own, proper training is required.\n\nSnuba's safety record among introductory diving methods looks quite impressive. Over 4 million dives and not one insurance claim for injury. The SNUBA® system is designed with safety in mind and Snuba guides are trained to ensure your dive is a safe and fun one. However, diving does carry with it risks that one should be aware of.\n\nPay close attention to your Snuba guide's safety briefing. Never let anyone (husband, family member, friends, etc.) force or pressure you into doing something you are not comfortable with. Discuss any concerns with your Snuba guide before going on a Snuba dive. Snuba guides are trained to inspect all equipment and evaluate all participants prior to every Snuba dive.\n\nAfter your Snuba dive if you are interested in going to the next step and trying scuba diving, your Snuba guide can assist you in locating a reputable dive training center \/ organization.\n\nIn strong current, wave action, or breeze, the combination of underwater hose and surface raft can pull quite hard on a diver. Snuba is therefore best used in areas where wind, waves and current are negligible. Since all SNUBA® use is offered by licensed operators who operate the systems as a guided tour, the probability of being subjected to strong current, high waves or high wind is not likely. However it is good practice if one employee of the operator remains on the surface to monitor conditions.\n\nSince the depth of a snuba dive is limited to about 6 metres (20 ft), decompression sickness is not likely to be a problem. However, as the snuba diver is breathing compressed air, there is still a risk of injury or death due to air embolism, which is a more severe hazard at shallow depths.\n\nIf a diver ascends as little as three feet without venting the expanding gas volume in the lungs can cause rupture of lung tisue and escape of air into the circulation and\/or other tissues. Air bubbles travelling with the blood may block circulation in vital tissues such as the brain or heart. This life-threatening condition is known as Arterial Gas Embolism. This danger is easily avoided by breathing normally and continuously while ascending. This point should be thoroughly covered in Snuba pre-dive briefings, and should be monitored by the dive guide throughout the dive by watching for the continual release of bubbles from each diver. However most lung overpressure diving accidents do happen within 15 feet of the surface of the water because this is where the greatest change in volume occurs, and a panicking diver may reach the surface before the guide has noticed a problem. Unfortunately this depth range is where snuba diving takes place. According to certified diving agencies, like PADI and NAUI, Snuba is slowly being phased out due to the number of the diving accidents that have been recorded due to the lack of certification and training involved, but according to the Snuba website, since starting operations in 1989, almost 5 million dives have been done without injury or fatality (they do not mention whether any other dives have resulted in injury - the wording is ambiguous).\n\nThe Snuba Liability Release form releases the operators and developers of the Snuba system from any liability or responsibility for damage, injury or death due to neglect, system failure or any other reason, nevertheless there are many nonofficial reports about inadequate training.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Respect"]},"\nAll Snuba Recreational Centers are members of the Reef Alliance.
