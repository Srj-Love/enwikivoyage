Since it is not a reef island, it does not have the sandy beaches most notable in the Caribbean, but rather mostly cliff faces and rocky shore. The island, however, attracts tourists for its diverse and vibrant ecosystem and the unique diving experiences (pinnacle diving, wall diving, etc).\n\nThe population of Saba is 1,424 people spread into four major villages, and includes the 200-300 medical students attending the Saba University of Medicine. The medical school houses a hyperbaric chamber, which coincides nicely with Saba's extensive diving draw.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Windwardside.jpg"],["thumb"],["350px"],["Windwardside as seen from the road to Booby Hill"]]},"\n\nPolitically, Saba is a \"special municipality\" fully integrated in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Netherlands"]]}," proper.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nIt is said that Christopher Columbus sighted Saba on his trans-Atlantic voyage, but did not land due to the rocky shores.  The island was colonized in 1640 when a group from the Dutch West India Company were sent in from neighboring ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sint Eustatius"]]},".   In 1664 these settlers were evicted by the notorious buccaneer Sir Henry Morgan.  This is one of the few times that the rough terrain of Saba was successfully invaded.  The ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Netherlands"]]}," finally took over in 1816, and that is how it remains today.\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, Saba was a haven to pirates throughout the Caribbean.  Most notably, Hiriam Breaks, who coined the saying, \"Dead Men Tell No Tales,\" took residence in Saba. \n\nSugar and rum were Saba's chief exports through the 18th century, as well as fishing (particularly lobster fishing) later.  Once trade routes became more open, Saban Lace (elaborate pulled-thread work) became very popular.  By 1928 the women of Saba were exporting $15,000 (USD) worth of lace yearly.\n\nFor a long time the only way in and out of Saba for people or for goods was via treacherous Ladder Bay and \"The Ladder\", which is 800 rock and concrete steps that have a near-vertical grade. At that time Fort Bay had no breakwater to shelter it, so landing there was also a risky undertaking that was quite impossible during high seas. For most of its history Saba had no road, only footpaths. Experts had expressed the opinion that it was impossible to build a road on the island.\n\nFinally in the mid 20th century, a self-educated local engineer dedicated himself to the idea of creating a road, and succeeded in building that which had been deemed impossible by engineers before him.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Orientation"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:House_Windwardside_Saba.JPG"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Typical House in Windwardside"]]},"\n\nThere are four small villages on Saba. \n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Bottom"]}," is the largest village and is the capital of the island.

Over the next 20 years, 14 km of road was painstakingly laid by hand and wheelbarrow by locals. It is said the men of Hell's Gate put in the most effort on the project because their village was the farthest away from Fort Bay.  However, the creation of the airport later on Flat Point meant that the main point of arrival on Saba was now diametrically opposite: in the northeastern tip, rather than in the southwest.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Juancho E. Yrausquin Airport"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Saba airport.jpg"],["thumb"],["Saba airport"]]},"\nOpened in 1963, Saba's airport is a 400-meter (1,300-foot) length of runway sitting on Saba's biggest flat piece of land, a cliff-ringed promontory known as \"Flat Point\". Many pilots consider this to be the world's most dangerous airport, even though no major tragedies have occurred there.  The runway is marked with a large white X at each end signaling that it is not to be used by most commercial airplanes.  In fact, pilots need special training to land here, and Winair is the only airline currently serving the airport, using the DHC-6 Twin Otter.\n\nThe danger comes from the airport's location in relation to the rest of the island. The side by which aircraft come in is flanked by a large cliff that the plane flies directly towards, before banking hard left, in order to line up with the runway. The airport is 18 meters (60 feet) above the ocean, and sheer cliffs on both sides of the runway lead to those rocky depths. There is a risk of an airplanes over-shooting the runway and falling into the ocean.  A crosswind will cause airplanes to abort landings, as the rough turbulence can give even good pilots a hard time.\n\nTravelers should know about this ahead of time, but the airport's excellent safety record should put them at ease about this landing, which in undertaken 5 times daily.  The airport is the shortest international runway in the world.  The airport has a bar, no air-traffic-control station, and the airport manager is known by pilots for paying very close attention to every incoming flight, and if he rates a landing as a little too sloppy, he will most assuredly come out and complain to the pilot in no uncertain terms.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora, fauna, and ecology"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Saba travel map.png"],["thumb"]]},"\n\nSaba has a lot of different types of plant life on the island, most notably its wild orchids.

You can't go too far without seeing these wild orchids, as they grow along hiking trails, in gardens throughout the island, and even along the side of The Road.\n\nOver 60 species of birds inhabit the island, while over 200 kinds of fish swim near its shores. All of this diversity comes from Saba's unique ecology.  The ocean surrounding the island goes from fairly shallow to very deep, with pinnacles scattered throughout. A fair portion of the island is considered rain forest, and Mount Scenery is home to a diverse range of climatic conditions in which an impressive variety of living organisms can thrive.  \n\nBe it lizards, aphids, sea life, or other creatures, Saba offers a level of diversity that seems impossible given the island's extremely small size.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nThere are two official languages in Saba: Dutch and English, which is the predominant language.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nSaba is a 15 minutes plane ride from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["St. Maarten"]]},"'s Juliana International Airport, the regions largest airport with flights to the US and Europe.
