From Iboih to Semur Tiga in shared transport costs Rp100,000 (~1 hr drive). Prices for minibuses (shared transport) from and to harbour are fixed (also if there is only one passenger in the car). \n\nA possibly cheaper option is to arrange transport in becaks or on motorbikes. For this transport you need to bargain.\nYou can also take the whole taxi for Rp150,000. Bargain hard, since the prices are not set (although the drivers try to show you written notes with prices).\n\nAlternatively you can rent motorbikes at Iboih and Gapang and Semur Tiga (Rp100,000 per day). Besides that bicycles are for rent in Iboih,Santai Sumur Tiga and several Places like Kartika and Holiday Hotel. If you want to cycle from the port to your hotel its best to rent a bicycle in Banda Aceh and take it with you on the boat.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThere's not much to see in the city of Sabang, but it is worth a day trip if you have a motorbike to explore.  The \"downtown\" of Sabang is on the harbor side of town. It is a street with long rows of small shops, most of which are closed up. There are a few banks here that accept bank cards for when you need additional cash. Follow the road up the hill and you'll drive past a Japanese bunker that has been converted into a park. The road along the ridge is lined with giant trees that create a canopy of foliage overhead. On this street, you'll also find a number of historic Dutch colonial buildings. Watch out for the historic markers in front of the buildings and parks around the city.\n\nWhile there are guest houses (losman) in Sabang, you should head straight to either Gapang or Iboih beaches (40-50 minutes from the ferry).\n\nThe main reason to go to Pulau Weh is for the beaches.  Relaxing, swimming, snorkeling, diving.  Don't worry about doing anything else.\n\nKilometer Nol (Kilometer 0), the most Western point in Indonesia, is on Pulau Weh.  You can rent a motorbike from Iboih for around 100,000 Rp\/day and head out on your own, or rent a minivan and guide to take your group.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nSwimming, whether above or below the surface, it the most popular activity around the island.

For as little as 30,000 IDR, you can spend the day drifting around the shore and exploring off the beaches. There are numerous reef fish close to shore. Local Indonesian people come here by the busload to don wet-suits and bright orange flotation vests to drift in the current and observe the sea-life. \n\nIf you are a strong swimmer, you can make your way across the channel to Rubiah island (and avoid the exorbitant 150,000 IDR per person fee charged by the local pirates, um, boatmen). The island has some nice snorkeling and there are places to eat and sleep as well. The \"Sea Garden\" off of Rubiah is a particularly good dive spot and provides a chance to see moray eels and turtles.  Your hotel may be able to provide a boat and captain for as little as 150,000 IRD for half a day.\n\nIf you are a strong swimmer and can catch the right tide, you can jump in the channel at the boat pier and drift all the way to the Yulia hotel pier on the outgoing tide. Note that this will take you into deep water were there are fewer fish visible, so try to keep closer to shore.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Dive"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Gapang Beach, Sabang, Aceh.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["Gapang Beach"]]},"\nSingle dive starts at â‚¬25, cheaper the more you do. Island has around 20 dive sites which are way less populated than elsewhere in Indonesia, and the life under water is simply spectacular.\n\nIt's still considered a secret spot even among the diving community and Pulau Weh's reefs are genuinely untouched and offer something for every level of experience. The bottom topography ranges from large boulders on sandy slopes and deep volcanic pinnacles to craggy wall sections and coral gardens.  \n\nThe house reef at Gapang Beach boasts a wide range of macro life including rare critters like Frog Fish, Star Gazers and Gurnards. Large pelagics like Mantas, Whale Sharks and Mola Mola also come to feed when the season is right. Pulau Weh offers some of the finest diving in Indonesia, yet it is still very much undeveloped.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Rubiah Tirta Divers"],["url=http:\/\/rubiahdivers.com\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Dive school based in Iboih, with a lot of restaurants and accommodations nearby.

Basically rice with some vegetables, maybe chicken (ayam) or egg (telur) depending on your request. The restaurants in the village are generally cheaper than those belonging to the bungalows.
