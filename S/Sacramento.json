It was founded in 1849 and there are many reminders of the history of the city including Sutter's Fort, Old Sacramento, and remnants of the original ground level of Sacramento. It experienced explosive growth when gold was discovered in 1848 in nearby ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Coloma, California"]]},", and the gold rush that followed was the largest human migration in history. Currently it has a population of 490,000 in the city and over two million in the metropolitan area.\n\nThe pace of life is somewhat slower than in other large Californian cities, and the people are generally warm and friendly. According to Time magazine Sacramento is the most diverse city in the USA. The city used to be an affordable place, but it suffered from the San Francisco Bay Area's dot com rise and fall, and real estate went from undervalued to overvalued.  The market is correcting itself so property values in most neighboorhoods have leveled off while others are dropping to more reasonable valuations.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nSacramento has a Mediterranean-type climate with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. Being further inland than most of the other major California cities, Sacramento is subject to more temperature variation. Winter high temperatures are commonly in the 40s and 50s Fahrenheit (10-20*C), and at night the temperature drops below freezing every so often. The summer heat can be intense, with temperatures exceeding 100*F (37.7*) not unusual. Generally speaking, the warmer it gets, the drier it gets, so even the most intense Sacramento heat is easily alleviated by a quick dip in the swimming pool.\n\nSacramento's hot, dry summers are mitigated by a phenomenon locals call \"the delta breeze.\" Heat waves rarely last more than three to five days, because as hot air builds over California's interior valleys, cold ocean air is sucked inland through the Sacramento river delta, acting as natural air conditioning and dropping the temperature sharply. The delta breeze tends to hit the westernmost areas of Sacramento late in the afternoon and travel east\/northeast at ten to fifteen miles per hour, so the hour at which your neighborhood cools depends on your proximity to the river delta or how far west\/south you reside.\n\nMost rain falls in the from around fall to mid spring and occasionally early summer. Generally speaking, however, you can count on sunny days from the middle of April until at least the middle of October. Winter is known not only for its rain but also its dense fog, which can hamper driving conditions and reduce visibility to 100 feet (30 m) at times. Snow is rare, but once every 5-10 years a light dusting occurs, and even some light accumulation away from the city. In the foothills not far east of the city, snow is much more common, and the Tahoe-area ski resorts are within easy reach of the Sacramento metropolitan area. Sacramento's location in the heart of California's agricultural interior gives it a blossom-laden spring as a profusion of fruit trees bloom and flower filled grassland. It also experiences a \"foliage fall\"—autumn color without the severe weather that accompanies brilliant color in other parts of the nation.\n\nSevere weather is rare in Sacramento, with the primary concern being heat in summer and local flooding in winter. Occasional summer thunderstorms and even tornadoes can occur, but they are extremely rare. Sacramento is not in a known earthquake zone.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Smoking"]},"\n\nSmoking is prohibited by state law at all restaurants and bars, most workplaces (workplaces with five or fewer employees are exempt from the ban as long as all workers consent), and all public buildings.

Stay in Downtown or Midtown. This is where most tourists are anyway. The upscale clubs and lounges tend to be on or near J Street. Directly across from the Capitol grounds is the Park which is the premiere Sacramento nightclub. The dress code and cover charges tend to be stiff.\n\nJust around the corner is the Capitol Garage which typically has guest DJ's on Saturday and a $5 cover in a laid back atmosphere. On K Street, you'll find Marilyn's, a really cool underground bar in the heart of downtown which showcases local live music talent.\n\nNearby is the Crest Theater, an independent historic movie theater that boasts art deco design. In the summer you can catch the French Film Festival here as well as the Trash Film Orgy, an all-night spectacle of old B movie flicks where locals gather in their cheesiest costumes.\n\nOn most days of the year, however, the Crest is the place to catch foreign and independent films as well as traveling stand-up comedy and music acts. On 16th and R Street. you'll find the popular bar R15. This is a trendy bar\/restaurant (Cafe Bernardo is attached) that has an urban industrial feel. Despite being trendy the prices are very affordable with $2 Pabst on tap and $1 pool tables. They also boast couches and big screens where you can play x-box for free with a couple of friends.\n\nR Street corridor offers Shady Lady Saloon, R15 Bar, and restaurants.\n\nAnother popular club is Mix Downtown with stiff cover charges and dress code as well, but Mix attracts an older crowd than District 30 and less pretentious crowd than the Park. On 10th and S Street, you'll find the popular indie-rock venue Old Ironsides. Local and traveling indie-rock talent showcase their music here. Every Tuesday you can catch Lipstick, a popular indie-rock dance party where you'll find mostly hip Midtown locals. Every first Saturday of the month you can catch After Dark which is like Lipstick only on a Saturday so it attracts a more varied metropolitan crowd.\n\nThe Press Club on 21st and P Street is popular with the college crowd with its $5 cover charges and cheap $3 24oz. of Pabst. It's known for playing 80's dance music and the best nights to go are Wednesdays or Thursdays as it is a small club and, on weekends, gets unbearably overcrowded.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["drink"],["name=The Depot"],["url="],["email="],["address=corner of K and 20th downtown."],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Gay-friendly video bar, two coin-op pool tables, covered smoking area."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["drink"],["name=Faces"],["url="],["email="],["address=Corner of K and 20th"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Faces is a popular gay-friendly club.

Be aware of your surroundings, lock your car doors, don't carry a large amount of cash, and don't wear flashy clothing or jewelry.\n\nAs with other large metropolitan areas, there are neighborhoods that deserve more caution than others at night.  Be cautious while in the following areas:\n\nCentral District—especially at night.  Most of the businesses close up early, though the nightclubs there can draw crowds and those looking for trouble especially after too much to drink.\n\nSouth Sacramento Area—especially at night. It has been cleaned up in recent years but there are still rough patches especially around Martin Luther King Junior Boulevard, Fruitridge Road, Franklin Boulevard, Mack Road, and Meadowview Road.\n\nNorth Highlands—at night, prostitutes are usually strolling Watt Avenue between Roseville Road and I-80.  The motels at Longview Drive and I-80 are some of the worst in the north Sacramento area. Avoid them if at all possible.\n\nDel Paso Heights used to be of the worst crime infested areas in the Sacramento Region, but has recently attracted numerous galleries, boutiques and restaurants. Stay safe, but there's no reason to avoid it.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Consulates"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["Mexico"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Mexico"],["url=http:\/\/portal.sre.gob.mx\/sacramento"],["email="],["address=1010 8th St"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 916 441-3287"],["tollfree="],["fax=+1 916 441-3147"],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["New Zealand"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=New Zealand (Honorary)"],["url=http:\/\/www.nzembassy.com\/united-states-of-america\/about-the-embassy\/contact-us\/nz-honorary-consuls"],["email="],["address=44733 N El Macero Dr, El Macero"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 530 756-8013"],["tollfree="],["fax=+1 530 756-7032"],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nPart of the beauty of Sacramento is its central location.
