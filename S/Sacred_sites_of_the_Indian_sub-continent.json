Born in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lumbini"]]}," as heir to the throne of the Kingdom of Sakya (in present day ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nepal"]]},", near the Indian border), Prince Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha's former name) discovered that a life of luxury did not lead to peace of mind, and that the rich, like the poor, still suffer the torments of old age, sickness and death. He therefore renounced his title and abandoned his wealth in order to seek a way that could lead all beings, without discrimination, to  freedom from suffering. He spent six years  experimenting with the various common methods of the day, but to no avail. Finally, at the age of thirty-five and while meditating under the bodhi tree at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bodh Gaya"]]},", he awoke to the insights he had been seeking. The essence of the Buddha's discovery are categorized in his first teaching that was delivered to a group of five ascetics at the Deer Park in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sarnath"]]}," and is called the Four Noble Truths. The Buddha finally passed away in a copse of sal trees at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kushinagar"]]},". He was believed to be over 80 years old at the time. \n\nFor many centuries, Buddhism was the major religion in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["India"]]},", and was supported by many great kings, with Asoka the Great  (273–232 BC)  perhaps the most famous. Buddhism's influence in India waxed and waned over the next millennium, and during the 6th and 7th century support was mostly confined to Southern India. However, perhaps the single most significant blow to Buddhism in India occurred in 1193 when Turkic Islamic raiders burnt  the great Buddhist center of learning in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nalanda"]]}," (in current day ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bihar"]]},"), and by the end of the 12th century it had all but disappeared from the lowlands, though it continued to thrive in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Himalayas"],["Himalayan regions"]]},". \n\nBuddhism as a philosophy and religion can roughly be divided into two schools: Theravada and Mahayana. The Theravada school which spread to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Thailand"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sri Lanka"]]}," and other ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South East Asia"]]},"n countries promotes personal liberation from suffering, whereas the Mahayana, which is prevalent in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Japan"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Taiwan"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Korea"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bhutan"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tibet"]]},", emphasizes the liberation of all beings. The Vajrayana school, which is often called  Tibetan Buddhism, is an offshoot of Mahayana and differs from it only in method, not philosophy. A common thread throughout all Buddhist schools is the cultivation of wisdom and compassion as a basis of interacting with the world, and the total rejection of religious conversion. All schools of Buddhism recognize karma (the law of cause and effect) as the creator of our illusory universe, which Buddhists refer to as ",{"type":"''","value":["samsara"]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Common images and symbols"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Dharma wheel.svg"],["thumb"],["The eight-spoked dharma chakra represents the Noble Eight-fold path taught by the Buddha"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Buddha Sakyamuni"]},".
