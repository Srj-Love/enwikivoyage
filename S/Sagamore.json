"]},"\nSagamore and Sagamore Beach are proud little villages of Bourne.  Sagamore Beach is on the 'mainland' side of the canal, while Sagamore is on the 'Cape-side'.  Both villages are well worth exploring.  Sagamore Beach prides itself on being one of the hidden jewels of the region.  It's well worth a little exploration through the winding roads of this area, particularly noting the historic homes along one of the highest, and arguably quietest beach vistas in Barnstable County.  It must be noted that a significantly smaller portion within this village is in Sandwich. On the south side, it's Sagamore, also a village of Bourne, once the home to a thriving car manufacturing company.  Note that as soon as you cross the bridge, Route 3 becomes Route 6 -otherwise known as the Mid Cape Highway. If you go past that first exit - which comes up quickly as soon as you are over the bridge, you are past Sagamore and into Sandwich. So for now, think of getting off at exit one - taking the ramp to your right. If you do you will almost immediately come across one of Sagamore's tourist attractions - The Cape Cod Outlet Mall (a right turn on the ramp as it winds around):featuring Reebok, Hanes, Jones of New York, and other outlet shopping opportunities. But for now, hold off on the outlet shopping and take the ramp all the way to its end, at a set of signal lights. You are now facing the canal, and Route 6A. Take a right here and you will begin your trek along Route 6A- past bookstores, antique shops, restaurants, and some historic seafaring communities.  But as we are just addressing Sagamore here, take a right on 6A but, after you pass under the bridge (the Sagamore Bridge you came over on a minute ago), look for the right turn (big sign) for the Christmas Tree Store. This is the famous 'windmill' branch of this Cape Cod landmark outlet store. Take that right, but before you spend your 'wad' on the fab bric-a-brac of the Christmas Tree store, take note: at the far end of the parking lot for the Xmas Store, is a quaint little Cape Cod tradition that you should not miss. The store is called 'ChocoLatte', but for years it was just known as 'The Chocolate House'. ChocoLatte continues on the tradition of real, Copper-Kettle Cape Cod Fudge: made on the premises in antique copper pots. Generation after generation return just for that fudge. But ChocoLatte offers more - including their justly famous Bog Beans - an authentic, original chocolate covered cranberry (their own creation), along with dozens of fine chocolates, hand-crafted lattes and espressos, fresh brewed micro-roast coffees, croissant, scones, muffins and more. In the summer try their Gelatto, in the winter warm soup - all that in a small, old fashioned store. As they say, the first and the last 'taste of the Cape'. Okay, so armed with your latte and a mouthful of fudge, stroll back over to the Christmas Tree Store and fill up on kitsch.. and all this in the first 100 yards of the Cape.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Pairpoint Glass Company"]},", Rt. 6A (Just north of the Sagamore Bridge), Sagamore ",{"type":"''","value":["+1"]}," 508-888-2344. 8:30AM-4:30PM.
