As with many Michigan cities, it is currently struggling to adapt to the challenges of having an economy based on the automotive industry. A recent article on AOL listed Saginaw in the Top 10 of 'Ghost Towns of the Future', due to its declining population, vacant downtown area, and lack of services\n\nOver the past 15 years, Saginaw has built an impressive network of health care facilities - hospitals, specialists, cancer treatment centers - that serves residents from many of the surrounding counties.\n\nSaginaw is a town with very high rates of violent crime and gang activity. While locals have been known to exaggerate the threat, the potential for violent crime is real. Visitors unfamiliar with the area would be wise to avoid residential neighborhoods in the city of Saginaw, especially east of the river and particularly at night. Downtown Saginaw can also get a bit rough, especially late at night when the bars clear out. That being said, if you exercise common sense and don't go looking for trouble, you'll be fine.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nYou can easily reach Saginaw via the I-75 freeway that runs north from Detroit. Downtown Saginaw is accessible from I-675.  You can fly into the MBS (Midland\/Bay City\/Saginaw) international airport.\n\nSaginaw and Saginaw County offer friendly, hospitable residents who welcome guests to the area.  The downtown Saginaw area is home to the Dow event center, home to the Saginaw Spirit (yes, the same Saginaw Spirit supported by Stephen Colbert) a celebrated OHL hockey franchise, home to the Saginaw Sting (the areas most popular arena football team), the Saginaw Symphony ranking at the top of the nation's symphony performing groups with international conductor Maestro Patrick Flynn and home to the Temple Theatre a fully resorted 1927 Vaudeville Theater home to an original Barton Organ.  There are also wonderful museums, the Saginaw Art Museum (Smithsonian Sanctioned) and the Mid-Michigan's Children's Museum.  A stop to Saginaw is well worth the time and value.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nYou'll need a car. Public transportation is limited.
