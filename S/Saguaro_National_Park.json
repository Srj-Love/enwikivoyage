There are  two separate regions of the park: Saguaro East lies twenty miles east of Tucson, and Saguaro West is located fifteen miles west of the city center.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nSaguaro National Park protects two separate areas of the Sonoran Desert near Tucson.  While both Saguaro East and Saguaro West contain high densities of saguaro cacti, the park is also home for numerous other desert species.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nSaguaro National Monument was initially created in 1933 by President Hoover, and became the 52nd national park in 1994.  Initially Saguaro National Monument consisted only of what is today Saguaro East (the Rincon Mountain District), with 15,364 acres of Saguaro West (the Tucson Mountain District) being added in 1964 by President Kennedy, and an additional 21,000 acres added later.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\nThe park is located within the Sonoran Desert, a dry and hilly area that includes both the Tucson Mountains and the Rincon Mountains.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and Fauna"]},"\n\nThe park's namesake, the massive saguaro can live as long as 200 years, growing over fifty feet tall and weighing more than ten tons.  The saguaro has become an icon of the desert, with its distinctive tall trunk and numerous curved arms that branch upward.  The saguaro survives in the hot, dry desert through a series of adaptations, including a folded skin that can expand or contract depending on the amount of water collected.   In addition, the lack of leaves and the plant's waxy skin reduces evaporation losses.  Unlike most plants cacti perform photosynthesis in their trunk.  The saguaro's root system usually lies within three inches of the ground surface and spreads out in a circle roughly as wide as the plant's height, allowing the cactus to collect any rainwater that may fall nearby.\n\nOther species of cactus in the park include the wide barrel cactus, the spiny fishhook and cholla cacti, and the oddly-constructed prickly pear cactus.  Various bushes, including creosote and mesquite, as well as numerous desert wildflowers, fill the desert with flowers after rains.\n\nMost animals in the desert are difficult to spot due to their nocturnal habits or camouflage, but keen-eyed visitors might find quail, roadrunners, woodpeckers, flickers, wrens, owls, hawks, desert tortoise, gila monsters, javelinas (wild pigs), kangaroo rats, coyotes, foxes, and jackrabbits.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nHigh temperatures during the summer frequently rise above 105 F, and an average of less than twelve inches of rain falls in the park each year.  Summer low temperatures average a still-balmy 75 F.  During the winter, the high temperature averages a much cooler 65 F, with nighttime lows around 40 F.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Saguaro-area-map.jpg"],["thumb"],["550px"],["Saguaro National Park area map"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Tucson International Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["TUS"]]},") ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.tucsonairport.org\/"]}," lies between the park's two districts.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Saguaro East (Rincon Mountain District)"]},"\n\nWhen traveling on I-10 west towards Tucson, take the Houghton Road exit (exit 275) north to Escalante Road, then turn right, heading east to Old Spanish Trail.

At the junction of Camino de Oeste, Speedway Boulevard becomes Gates Pass Road. Continue west on Gates Pass Road to Kinney Road. Take Kinney Road north, following signs to the park. Due to winding, narrow mountain grades, vehicles with trailers and RVs over 25 feet are not recommended through Gates Pass and should use the Ina Road exit (exit 248) on I-10, traveling west to Sandario Road, then turning left and heading south, following signs to the park.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\n\nAll private vehicles entering Saguaro National Park must pay a $10 entrance fee that is valid for seven days.

All backcountry camping requires a wilderness permit, which can be obtained for $6 from the Visitor Center.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nThe greatest danger in the park is the heat.  Plan on drinking at least one gallon of water per day, and never hike without carrying water.  When hiking, drink frequently even if you do not feel thirsty as the onset of thirst in the desert is often the first sign of dehydration.  During storms flash floods can pose serious hazards, and it is advisable to stay out of washes and canyons.\n\nAdditional dangers exist from the flora and fauna within the park.  Stepping on or touching a cactus spine can be an (obviously) painful experience; staying on the trails minimizes the chances of an unwanted cactus encounter.  Rattlesnakes and gila monsters are both poisonous, but in general neither will bite unless surprised or threatened.  Scorpion stings are painful but not fatal, and can be easily avoided by not reaching under rocks.  Javelinas may be dangerous if cornered.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tucson"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Saguaro National Park"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North America\/United States\/Arizona\/Travel and Tourism\/Parks\/National Parks and Monuments\/Saguaro National Park\/"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usablepark"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["32.2500"],["-110.5000"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["South_Central_Arizona"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["related"],["United_States_National_Parks"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Saguaro National Park"]]}]
