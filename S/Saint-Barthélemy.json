Its land area is 21.0 km² (8.1 sq. miles). Administratively, the whole island of Saint-Barthélemy is a French Overseas Collectivity, until recently part of Guadeloupe and is part of the European Union. \n\nThe island is also known as St Barts, Saint Barths, or Saint Barth.\n\nSt Barts has long been considered a playground of the rich and famous and is known for its beautiful pristine beaches, gourmet dining in chic restaurants and high-end designer shopping. There is one small airport that can only accommodate small prop planes from St Martin and San Juan, and the harbor is too small to accommodate cruise ships. The fact that it is hard to get to is part of the island's appeal. \n\nSinger Jimmy Buffett is a frequent visitor on the island, and owns a house there. He also owned a hotel, the Autor de Rocher, which burned down in the early '80s. David Letterman and Steve Martin also own property on the island, as well as the French singing star Johnny Hallyday.\n\nNoteworthy annual events include New Years, Carnival in February, The Bucket in late March (a sailing event featuring the largest sailing yachts in the world), and Bastille Day.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Gustavia"]]}]}," is the capital city, built around a colorful rectangular harbor lined with one and two story shops and restaurants.

Having massacred the native Arawaks in the 17th century, the French population, originating from Normandy and Brittany, is one of the oldest in the Caribbean. There was a minimal slave population on the island due to the lack of agricultural opportunities as the island is principally cliffs and hills and has no rivers or springs.\n\nThere are no official statistics but the \"native\" St Barths, known simply as \"St Barths\"  make up around 30% of the population and have a distinct culture and manner of speech that distinguishes them from the more recent Metropolitain French arrivals.\n\nThe island has changed hands several times over the centuries, belonging to Sweden from the late 18th to late 19th century, after they swapped it for some warehouses with the French. \n\nAs part of the Treaty with Sweden, St Barts (currently) pays no taxes.\n\nIt is very Gallic in flavour now, and English is widely spoken as the island is frequently visited by the wealthier end of the World's demographic.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Saint-Barthélemy travel map.png"],["thumb"],["420px"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nThe flights into St Barts is by small planes ideally adapted to the short runway.

However the island does specialise in high end tourism, and the island has some of the best hotels in the Caribbean.\nThe island of St Barts is refreshingly undeveloped. An old French communal law mandates that no building can be taller than a palm tree, so you'll find no high rises, and no massive resorts. In fact most of the rooms allocated to tourism on the island are found in private villas, not hotels.\n\nSt. Barth has about 25 hotels, most of them with 15 rooms or fewer, and the largest, the Guanahani, has just 70 rooms. Hotels are classified in the traditional French manner:  3-Star, 4-Star and 4-Star Luxe.\n\nVilla vacations are extremely popular and there are hundreds of villas terraced into the hillsides throughout the island as well as many beachfront locations. Villas here can range from one-bedroom bungalows to large luxurious homes.\n\nVilla rentals range from one bedroom to six bedrooms in size. Most are located on hillsides where they can be cooled by the prevailing winds, not on the beaches.
