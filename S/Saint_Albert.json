At this time, Father Lacombe convinced Bishop Taché that a mission be established on the Sturgeon River to serve the Aboriginals and the Metis of the district. The first building to be erected was a modest log chapel. Two years later, St. Albert became the site of the settlement’s first school with three Grey Nuns as its teachers.\n\nIn 1864, the “Youville Asylum” was opened and served as both convent and school. The Asylum later functioned as an orphanage and as the first hospital in Central Alberta.\n\nBy 1870, St. Albert had become the largest settlement west of St. Boniface, Manitoba. It boasted a population of 1,000 including both Metis and white settlers. Between 1870 and 1900, the area surrounding St. Albert attracted an increasing number of settlers, primarily French- Canadians. As a result, the community prospered and in 1904 was officially incorporated as a town.\n\nBy mid-century, St. Albert had begun to lose much of its rural appearance. Perron Street was home to a butcher shop, restaurants, hardware and general stores. In 1977, St. Albert became Alberta’s eleventh city.\n\nToday, St. Albert continues to grow and prosper, offering its 60,000 residents a high quality of life with abundant recreational opportunities and award winning cultural and arts programs.\" (http:\/\/www.stalbert.ca\/uploads\/files\/community\/visiting\/StAlbertVisitorGuide_10.pdf)\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nFly to the Edmonton International Airport. From there you can either pay for a shuttle or taxi. \n\nA cheaper alternative to getting into the City of Edmonton from the airport is by public transportation. There are four trips into the city between 4pm and 5:45pm. To get back to the airport on this bus you must catch it between 5:30 and 7:15am from Century Park LRT station. One way fare is $5 for adults, $4 for seniors and youth. Contact ETS for current information.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Public Transit"]},"\n\nSt.Albert Public Transit (STAT) offers local routes within the neighbourhoods of St.Albert, as well as regular commutes into the city of Edmonton. To travel within St.Albert will cost you $2.75, while an adult fare into Edmonton will cost $5.50 ($4.50 for youth and seniors). Ticket packs and monthly passes are also available. The main bus hubs are Village Landing and St.Albert Centre.\nIn the evenings and on Sundays bus service is limited to the Dial-a-Bus. If you are going into Edmonton you must either catch the commuter bus from the bus hub (Village or St.Albert Centre) or call a dial-a-bus to pick you up at your nearest stop in order to connect with the commuter bus. Dial-a-Bus requires you to call about an hour before the departure of the commuter bus, so be sure to plan ahead since the commuter buses in the evenings only leave once an hour. If you are coming back into St.Albert from Edmonton in the evenings then, once your back at Village Station, you simply hop on to the Dial-a-Bus at and tell the driver where you need to go and they will take you as close as they can to your destination. Further information, including dial-a-bus numbers, can be found at ridestat.ca.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Taxi"]},"\n\nThere are several options for taxi service within St.Albert and into Edmonton:\nSt.Albert Taxi (780-459-5050), Lime Taxi (780-418-1111),  Blueflame Cabs (780-459-9393), Brinki's Airport Service (780-918-3798)\nNote: It is sometimes difficult to find an Edmonton taxi to go into St.Albert on evenings and weekends, but if you ask enough drivers someone will usually do it for the right price.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=St.Albert Place"],["url="],["email="],["address=5 St.Anne Street"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Located in downtown St.Albert along the Sturgeon River, St.Albert Place is the home of the St.Albert Public Library, Arden Theatre, Musee Heritage Museum, art studio, as well as serving as an office space for government work.
