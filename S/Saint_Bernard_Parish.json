(A Louisiana \"Parish\" is the equivilent of a \"county\" in other states.)  The parish seat and largest city is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chalmette"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThe Parish, or \"Da Parish\" as locals often refer to it, borders the east bank of the Missisisppi River.

As of 2012 \"Da Parish\" is certainly back, though recovery and rebuilding are an ongoing process.\n\nThere are no incorporated communities in St. Bernard, so the names of towns and places are sometimes more a matter of what locals traditionally call a location than any legally set boundaries. (Just a heads up not to worry, for example, if that little restaurant you came across in what your road maps shows as the town of \"Violet\" has \"Chalmette\" printed on the menu and the mailing address listed as \"Meraux\".)\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Background"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:KenilworthLAPlantationHouseFront.JPG"],["right"],["thumb"],["Kenilworth Plantation House (originally Bienvenu), in St. Bernard's Terre aux Boeufs region, dates back to the 1750s."]]},"\n\nThe main roots of St. Bernard go back to the French and Spanish colonial era; the majority of the population still have Spanish or French family names.  One notable ethnic group is the Isleño population; a large group of people from the Spanish Canary Islands, known as \"Isleños\", settled in the Parish in the second half of the 1700s.  While Louisiana passed to the United States with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the Isleño Spanish dialect was still common to hear in some smaller towns and rural areas well into the 20th century.  While some locals keep the traditional Isleño songs and folklore alive, English is now universally understood here -- though locals may speak it with an accent unlike that usually found in the U.S.'s deep south. \n\nIn 1927 the Mississippi River was at historically high levels, and burst its banks many places further up river. The city of New Orleans's levees were right at the edge of being overtopped.  A group of New Orleans bankers hatched a plan to blow up a levee in St. Bernard in order to relieve pressure on the levees of New Orleans.  This was done, flooding much of the Parish.  The New Orleans bankers had promised generous compensation for the people of St. Bernard beforehand, but delivered very little (many people affected got nothing at all).  Local resentment of New Orleans continued for generations.\n\nIn 1965, much of the Parish was flooded when Hurricane Betsy hit Louisiana. Many locals blamed much of the flooding on a then new navigation canal, the Mississippi River – Gulf Outlet Canal or MRGO, commonly called \"Mister Go\", which they said funneled in storm surge from the Gulf of Mexico right into the populated area, acting as a \"Hurricane Highway\". The Army Corps of Engineers denied the MRGO had any link to the flooding.\n\nIn 2005, during Hurricane Katrina, walls of floodwaters several meters high crashed through the entire Parish, flooding on a scope that dwarfed previous disasters.   A series of independent investigations afterwards eventually made clear that the Parish locals had been right all along: MRGO indeed served as a \"superhighway for storm surge\", making MRGO, along with a series of badly misdesigned levees, the cause of most of the flooding in Greater New Orleans in 2005.  The MRGO Canal was deactivated, and a barrier closing it off completed in 2009.  A system of much improved levees and floodwalls is nearing completion. However the environmental damage that had already been caused by the engineering mistake of MRGO is estimated to be in the many billions of dollars range, and there is at present no plan nor suggested funding to repair it.\n\nAs fishing has long been an important industry here, the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill in 2010 dealt another blow to the Parish.\n\nSt. Bernard Parish, despite the problems, is resilient. While the population is only about half what it was in 2005, those who are back here are working hard to rebuild the home that they love.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nUnless you're downriver in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Plaquemines Parish"]]},", the only land routes into Saint Bernard are through New Orleans.
