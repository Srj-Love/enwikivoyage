The south side, past the National Hockey Center, has recently had trouble with car thefts, so take caution. The neighborhoods around campus are safe too, but will get rowdy Thursday through Saturday nights while school is in session with parties. Generally, these neighborhoods violate noise restrictions during these times rather than taking part in other crime. Police patrols have recently been increased.
