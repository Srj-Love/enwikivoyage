It acquired fame as the place of Napoleon Bonaparte's exile, from 1815 until his death in 1821, but its importance as a port of call declined after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. Saint Helena has three smaller dependencies:  Ascension Island is the site of a US Air Force auxiliary airfield; Tristan da Cunha is home to a very small community reliant on fishing for income; Gough Island has a meteorological station.\n\nSaint Helena's most famous resident, of course, was Napoleon, who was exiled there by the British. Apparently Elba was not far enough away. He died there, and you can visit his beautiful grave site in a flower-laden glade, but his remains were disinterred and are now at Les Invalides in Paris. You can visit his two residences on the island. He stayed at The Briars for about two  months, and lived the rest of his life in a house in Longwood. Both can be visited by appointment.\n\nThe grandest house on the island, however, is that of the governor. It looks like it was lifted straight out of 18th century England. There are marvellous land tortoises on the grounds, including one purported to be the oldest living vertebrate in the world.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:16 Napoleons exole St Helena June1970.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Napoleon's place of exile"]]},"\n\nThe flora and fauna of the island are marvellous. Though many endemic species have become extinct, there are some left to be seen. Cabbage trees, gum trees and the local ebony can all be seen. The ebony was thought to be extinct until a local botanist found a specimen hanging off a cliff. It is being propagated and planted around the island. The islanders have also begun to restore the native forests of the island. The Millennium Forest has been planted by many volunteers and consists largely of local gum trees. Native, old growth forests can be found on the highest peaks of the island. High Peak and Diana's Peak have beautiful natural areas.\n\nTwo animals are of note. The giant earwig was the largest in the world: between two and three inches long. The species was made extinct by researchers who collected them all. The second species is a happier story: although endangered, with only about 300 remaining, the Saint Helena Wirebird is a plover-like bird with long beak and legs. It is a land bird, and can be found in open areas. The playing fields behind the high school are a particularly good place to look without having to take a longer hike. The Wirebird is Saint Helena's national bird.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Orientation"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Jamestown"]}," is the capital and main town of Saint Helena.

The ship itself, however, is a fantastic experience. Filled with the locals travelling home and tourists, it is a great opportunity to meet some very interesting people and talk more about Saint Helena before you arrive.  The staff have planned some fun activities that seem like a home-made version of what you might get on big cruise ships.  These are truly charming.  Cricket on the deck for the Curry Cup is a must!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nSt Helena has a very limited public bus service ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.sthelenatourism.com\/pages\/public-transport.html"]},".  Introduced only in 2003, the routes and timetables are designed primarily to satisfy the needs of locals. Buses are rare, usually going once or twice only on some weekdays. Visitors can, with some planning use the bus service to reach some of the island's attractions and walking opportunities. Check timetables carefully and allow sufficient time to catch the return bus otherwise you may face a long walk back to Jamestown! Stops are well marked, but a nice wave will also get the driver to stop.\n\nTaxis are also available in Jamestown (the rank is behind the Tourist Information Office).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nRental cars (Â£10-12 a day) are probably the more practical method of travel, but be sure to reserve one in advance. There are not too many, and when the boat arrives with its twenty tourists or more, the travel industry can be overwhelmed, and don't expect your rental car to be a recent vehicle (Ford Escorts are common). Ask your hotel to arrange car hire for you.\n\nSaint Helena drives on the left, as in the United Kingdom. Likewise, the traffic signs in Saint Helena resemble those of the United Kingdom.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By foot"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:St-Helena-The Barn.jpg"],["thumb"],["280px"],["\"The Barn\""]]},"\n\nWalking is wonderful, but mostly in the highlands in the centre of the island.  The 21 Post Box Walks, a series of graded trails are a good way to explore much of the island. The walks and routes with maps are available in a book written by the island's Nature Conservation Group, available at the Tourist Office. The cliffs all around the perimeter make it impossible to walk along the coast at most points, access to the sea is normally by descent of the numerous steep valleys that cut through the volcanic landscape.  Though small, however, don't be deceived, distances can be great for a walker.  Bring water and sunscreen, but the Saints on the way will be happy to provide a refill if your water bottle runs dry.  \n\nIt is very hard to walk out of Jamestown.  The city is in a deep canyon coming from the highlands down to the shore, and there are three roads out, one up either edge of the canyon and the third, Barnes Road, an old track that leads to Francis Plain, perched on a plateau 500m above Jamestown.  The other way to get to the highlands is via the vertiginous Jacob's Ladder, an extremely tall 699-step staircase, originally built as an inclined plane to bring goods in and out of town.  Walking on the roads out of town would mean sharing narrow switchbacks with cars, lots of dust, and no pavements.  If you walk, even once you climb Jacob's Ladder, you still aren't halfway to the green spaces at the top, and have to walk through the beautifully named, but not so beautiful to look at, Half-Tree Hollow.  A rental car or the bus are much better options.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nThe official language of Saint Helena is English.  However it is often spoken with a strong accent and using ordinary English words in unusual ways.  This dialect is locally known as \"Saint\".  Examples include \"What your name is?\" and \"Us need one new tyre\" (us = 'we' and 'one' is used where 'a' or 'an' might be expected).\n\nThough the island culture is a melange of people from all over the world, immigration essentially ended long ago, and the Malay, Indian, African and other immigrants to the island have not maintained their original languages or cultures.  \"Intermarriage\" has been the standard on the island for so long that there are no racial differences to be made, let alone linguistic ones.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Jamestown"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["The Museum of Saint Helena"]}," is a great place to start your visit, though like most other attractions the hours are very limited.

Then it was used to bring goods down from the farming areas in the centre of the island, and manure up out of town. The planes are on either side of the steps, and the cart on one side was used to counterweight the cart on the other. The Ladder is a prodigious climb at over 900 feet long, with a vertical drop of about 600 ft (180 m) and with a slope in places of about 45 degrees and very few tourists can climb it in one go. In addition to its length, it's stairs are somewhat high, making the climb all the more difficult. There are railings, but no landings for the entire length, and those who are afraid of heights may not want to look down. If you see a kid around, you might want to ask them to show you how to slide down the railings; they are reputed to have invented a way to do this scary feat without killing themselves.
