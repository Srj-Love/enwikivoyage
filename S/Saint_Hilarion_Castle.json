Most of the castle is still in ruins.\n\nThe castle is named not after Saint Hilarion the Great, the founder of monasticism in Palestine who died near Paphos about 371AD, but after a later saint, of whom little is known. He is counted among the three hundred saints who according to local tradition, sought refuge in Cyprus when the Arabs overran the Holy Land. His relics were preserved in the castle and \"kept right worshipfully\" according to an English visitor in the 14th century. It may be presumed that he retired to this hill-top to live the life of a hermit and that as the hermitage of Saint Neophytos near Paphos, a monastery was established to shelter those who should follow his example, as well pilgrims to his tomb.
