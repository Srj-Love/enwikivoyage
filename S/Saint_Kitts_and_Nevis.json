Contrariwise, the architecture there is very Anglo-Saxon (Style Victorian) with driving on left and especially in downtown Basseterre: Circus Place the reproduction of the 'Berkeley Memorial Clock'.\n\nThe islands became an associated state of the United Kingdom with full internal autonomy in 1967. The island of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Anguilla"]]}," rebelled and was allowed to secede in 1971. Saint Kitts and Nevis achieved independence in 1983. In 1998, a vote in Nevis on a referendum to separate from Saint Kitts fell short of the two-thirds majority needed.\n\nThere are also several ancient British fortifications which have been restored with minutiae and reproducing the tiniest details of original construction. St-Kitts and Nevis will be called to be developed in the near future, in fact many projects are in progress or completion, notably vast dockings to accommodate the largest liners and cruisers with terminals, loading docks, etc.\n\nWhat is really remarkable on St-Kitts and Nevis is the natural aspect. Many tropical birds which one rarely finds elsewhere are present in great concentration in the nature and there are also the famous monkeys which, it is said, were introduced by the pirates. An all-new road permits going to the southeast end of St-Kitts (Turtle Beach) where one feels that a certain febrility in the air will make of this part of the island an appreciated place. Indeed, one has only to take a little adventure in the underwoods with some fruit in hand to see oneself quite soon surrounded by monkeys coming gently to meet one to get fed. For the inhabitants of the islands, on the other hand, the monkeys are not perceived as big a joy, for these pretty little hairy beings plunder the harvest and nose around everywhere they can go.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nTropical tempered by constant sea breezes; little seasonal temperature variation; rainy season (May to November).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\nWith coastlines in the shape of a baseball bat and ball, the two volcanic islands are separated by a three-km-wide channel called The Narrows; on the southern tip of long, baseball bat-shaped Saint Kitts lies the Great Salt Pond; Nevis Peak sits in the center of its almost circular namesake island and its ball shape complements that of its sister island.

Taxis and Buses use the same format of Micro buses, the difference is that taxis have a yellow license plate and start with the letter T and buses have a green one which starts with the letter H.

However if you have never visited the Caribbean before you may have difficulty understanding the patois, or more correctly the Creole language, spoken by the locals which is based on the English language but to the untrained ear sounds nothing like it.\nFor example \"a-come\" means coming \"a-knock\" means knocking.  Most notable is the simplification of use of pronouns as in \"I and I\" which replaces all other pronouns like she\/he, we\/my, yours, hers\/his and ours.  The Caribbean patois has its roots not only in African languages (west, central and Nigerian), standard English, Scottish and Spanish but also Perso-Arabic and Sanskrit.  Unusually the end result is not just a language but also a philosophical statement which emphasises the group relationship rather than the personal.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nOf course, with an area no larger than 261 km2, Saint Kitts and Nevis has a somewhat limited (but not absent!) array of typical sights.
