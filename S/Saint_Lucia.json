Its economic importance is expected to continue to increase as the market for bananas becomes more competitive. Tourism tends to be more substantial during the dry season (January to April). Saint Lucia tends to be popular due to its tropical weather and scenery and its numerous beaches and resorts.\n\nOther tourist attractions include a drive-in volcano and sulphur springs (both in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Soufriere"],["Soufrière"]]},"), the Botanical Gardens, the Majestic twin Peaks \"The Pitons\", A world heritage site, the rain forests, and Pigeon Island National Park, which is home to Fort Rodney, an old British military base.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nSaint Lucia's first known inhabitants were Arawaks, believed to have come from northern South America around 200-400 CE. Numerous archaeological sites on the island have produced specimens of the Arawak's' well-developed pottery.  Caribs gradually replaced Arawak's during the period from 800 to 1000 CE.\n\nEuropeans first landed on the island in either 1492 or 1502 during Spain's early exploration of the Caribbean. The British failed in their first attempts at colonization in the early 17th century. The island was first settled by the French, who signed a treaty with the local Caribs in 1660. Like the British and Dutch, the French began to develop the island for the cultivation of sugar cane on extensive plantations.\n\nCaribbean conditions were hard, and many slaves died before they lived long enough to have children. The French (and later British) continued to import slaves until the latter nation abolished the trade, and then the legal institution. By that time, people of ethnic African descent greatly outnumbered those of ethnic European background.\n\nThereafter Saint Lucia was much contested by the two European powers until the British secured it in 1814. It was part of the British Windward Islands colony. It joined the West Indies Federation (1958–62) when the colony was dissolved. In 1967, Saint Lucia became one of the six members of the West Indies Associated States, with internal self-government. In 1979 it gained full independence.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nTropical, moderated by northeast trade winds; dry season from January to April, rainy season from May to August; Experiences hurricanes.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Terrain"]},"\nVolcanic and mountainous with some broad, fertile valleys.\n\n",{"type":"''","value":["Natural hazards"]},": volcanic activity.\n\n",{"type":"''","value":["Highest point"]},": Mount Gimie 950 m\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Saint Lucia map (en).png"],["thumb"],["right"],["300px"],["Map of Saint Lucia"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Castries"]]}," - Capital"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Vieux Fort"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Soufriere"]]}," - Old Capital"]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Gros Islet"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Marigot Bay"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nCitizens of the following countries do not need visas:\nAndorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Austria, Bahamas, Barbados, Beglium, Belize, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark (includes Faroe Islands and Greenland), Dominica, Estonia, Fiji, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Grenada, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Kiribati, South Korea, Kuwait, Latvia, Lesotho, Liechtenstein, Lithania, Luxembourg, Malawi, Maldives, Malta, Marshall Islands, Mauritius, Mexico, Monaco, Montenegro, Namibia, Nauru, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Panama, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, San Marino, Seychelles, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Spain, Swaziland, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tanzania, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, Tuvalu, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, Vanuatu, and Zambia.\n\nFor dependencies:\n",{"type":"*","value":["The Dutch municipalities of Bonaire, Saba, Sint Eustatius, and the Dutch constituent countries of Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Marteen"]},{"type":"*","value":["The French overseas collectivities of French Polynesia and Saint Martin"]},{"type":"*","value":["The French overseas regions of French Guiana, Guadelope, and Martinique"]},{"type":"*","value":["The British Overseas Territories of Anguilla, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, Montserrat, Saint Helena, and the Turks and Caicos Islands"]},{"type":"*","value":["All three British Crown Dependencies"]},{"type":"*","value":["Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands."]},"\nIf your nationality is not mentioned anywhere above, you will need to apply for a visa.\nAs of the moment, citizens of Haiti do need visas but this is temporary.\n\nMost nationalities pay $50 for a single-entry tourist visa.

The tours arranged by resorts are usually the most expensive way to travel but might offer food and drink. Using a local taxi operator to plan your own adventure will be much more affordable. Your hotel staff should provide you with a number of a taxi agency or operator that they use regularly. The prices are generally fixed but you can shop around to get the best rate if given several numbers.

Each van will hold between 6 and 12 people.\n\nFor the budget travellers or the more adventurous tourists, local buses provide a cheap and fun way of getting around.

If you want to try and take a transport discuss your route and travel time with one of the local staff familiar with the bus system. Many of them likely take a transport to and from work.\n\nWater taxis are a main source of income for many locals and can be a much quicker, convenient and picturesque method of traveling short distances to private beaches or coastal towns. Many water taxi operators in the Town of Soufriere can be found at the jetty. The rates of these drivers are a little high and can be bargained down.

Vegetarian and meat rotis can be found at a number of small local restaurants. Ask any local for the best roti shop and he or she will tell you how to get there. Rotis are usually made fresh in the morning so, if eating a spicy early lunch is of interest, it's highly recommended. Local cuisine is prepared throughout the island so, depending on where you are staying, ask a local if he or she knows someone\/somewhere that prepares local food and you will be sure to be welcomed somewhere nearby. Many rum shacks in rural towns also prepare food if given advanced notice. Fish, veggie, chicken and goat meals are very common and usually come with a number of sides including salad, plantain, breadfruit, macaroni, and rice prepared a number of different ways.\n\nFor a quick snack, barbeques with chicken and pork can be found in any community on a Friday night. The food is well marinated and spiced. Soak up the sauce with a barbequed or fried bake. Fried chicken and fish can also be found, and are quite delicious.\n\nThere are weekly parties and festivals held in various communities throughout the island where you can also sample a range of local foods, including sea food, barbequed meats, salads and drinks.
