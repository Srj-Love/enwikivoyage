The plan's main feature was a set of eight main avenues that formed an octagon, about 0.75 miles (1.2 km) on a side.  Unfortunately, upon arrival at the planned location, they discovered Elk Creek meandering through the area, not to mention hills and valleys that prohibited construction of the octagon.\n\nToday, a vestige of the original plan can still be found, in the form of Joseph Road, Michael Street, St. Marys Street, and Theresia Road, which together do form a rough approximation of half an octagon.  It's the 135-degree intersection of Michael and St. Marys that forms the Diamond, the modern-day center of downtown."]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nSaint Marys was founded by Bavarian Catholic immigrants in 1842, and today it still retains the early settlers' work ethic, industrial nature, and religious devotion.\n\nThe original settlers intended to take up farming as their primary industry, but the terrain was found to be unsuitable to widespread agriculture.  Fortunately, there were other resources to which they could turn.  First among these was logging, facilitated by powerful new steam engines, and the corresponding lumbering industry.\n\nBrickmaking was popular for a while, as well as brewing.  Around the turn of the 20th century, carbon and powdered metal became an important part of the borough's economy.  Saint Marys was also the site of an early light bulb manufacturing company, the Novelty Incandescent Lamp Company; through a series of mergers and name changes that company became Sylvania, which still maintains a major facility in Saint Marys over 100 years later.\n\nIn 1992, Saint Marys absorbed the surrounding township of Benzinger and incorporated as a city, leading to the slogan \"Pennsylvania's Newest City\".  Most of the \"city\" limits remains wild, with business and residences found primarily within the former borough limits.\n\nToday, powdered metal, carbon, beer, and light bulbs are still the cornerstones of the Saint Marys economy, but like many old industrial areas, the city is shifting toward more service-oriented businesses.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nSaint Marys lies at the intersection of Pennsylvania Routes 255 and 120.  U.S. Route 219, the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway"]},", is the main route into and out of Elk County.  To get from U.S. 219 to Saint Marys, there are three options.  From the north, take Route 255 in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Johnsonburg (Pennsylvania)"],["Johnsonburg"]]}," and travel nine miles southeast to Saint Marys.  From the south, take Route 255 in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dubois (Pennsylvania)"],["Dubois"]]}," and travel 30 miles northeast to Saint Marys.  U.S. 219 also passes through ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ridgway (Pennsylvania)"],["Ridgway"]]},", ten miles west of Saint Marys; the two are connected by Route 120.\n\nFrom the east or west, you will probably be coming in on I-80; take exit 101 (Route 255) in DuBois, or take exit 111 (Route 153) north where it connects with Route 255.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["St. Marys Municipal Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["STQ"]]},") is three miles southeast of the downtown area on South Michael Street.

As far as major routes go, it couldn't be simpler; Route 255 comes in from the northwest (Johnsonburg) and leaves to the south (DuBois); Route 120 comes in from the west (Ridgway) and leaves to the east (Emporium).  Where it gets tricky, however, is at the intersection in the middle of downtown where those two routes meet.  It's a triangular plot of land called ",{"type":"'''","value":["the Diamond"]},", and in addition to the two state routes, the railroad tracks, Elk Creek, and multiple local roads all pass through.\n\nStaying on Route 255 southbound is the only straightforward path through the Diamond.  For anything else, you'd be advised to take along a local for your first few attempts.  If that's not practical, then watch the signs and surrounding vehicles carefully and be prepared to go around the block and try again if you miss.\n\nThe central business district is anchored by the Diamond, extending south on South Saint Marys Street (Route 255), southeast on South Michael Street, and east on Brusselles Street (Route 120).  Businesses in the downtown area are primarily locally owned.  The major commercial strip is farther south on Route 255, along a section known as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Million Dollar Highway"]},"; this is where you'll find the chain restaurants, hotels, and shops.  A relatively new Wal-Mart lies just south of the city limits on Million Dollar Highway, marking the southern end of the commercial strip.\n\nBeyond the major streets, you'll want a map to get around; the terrain combined with the odd angles at intersections mean there are few right angles and a lot of dead-ends.  Fortunately, most everything a traveler needs can be found on the major roadways (including North and South Michael Street).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Deckers Chapel.JPG"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Decker's Chapel, with the Best Western in the background"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Decker's Chapel"],["url="],["email="],["address=S.
