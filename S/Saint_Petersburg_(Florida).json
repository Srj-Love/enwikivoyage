Williams from Detroit, Michigan, who purchased the land in 1876. The town began with the help of Peter Demens, who was instrumental in bringing a railroad connection there in 1888. Saint Petersburg was named after the Saint Petersburg in Russia, the birthplace of Peter Demens. A local legend says that John C. Williams and Peter Demens flipped a coin to see who would have the honor of naming the city. Peter Demens won and named the city after his birthplace, while John C. Williams named the first hotel after his birthplace, Detroit. The Detroit Hotel still exists downtown, but it was converted into condos in 2002.\n\nThe city publishes the free \"Downtown St.Petersburg Guide & Map\" booklet, updated each season, that contains maps, trolley routes, and listings for hundreds of museums, events, restaurants, & hotels along with coupons.

In 1973, a 4-story building in the shape of an inverted pyramid was constructed at the end of the existing pier and became a city icon for the next four decades. However, the rest of the pier structure dated to 1926 and required an increasing amount of money for repairs. In 2010, the city decided that the money needed to repair the pier and give it an additional 20 years of usable life was too much and that, instead, the pier would be entirely replaced. The inverted pyramid closed to the public on the night of May 31, 2013 and is expected to be demolished later in the year. The approach to the building will remain open for public use until then.
