For 3-5 hours, a common rate is around $50 per hour, so four or more people can have a \"private\" tour for much less than all on a \"bus\" tour.

The sign of choice is black numbers on a white circle, the same as several states on the mainland. You generally should not stray off the numbered routes (except in Charlotte Amalie) unless you need to do so to go to your hotel or resort. Unlike St. John or St. Croix, all of St. Thomas' numbered routes are paved. However, the routes are not well signed on most of the southern half of the island, especially around Charlotte Amalie, and they are prone to suddenly turning off onto another road or changing numbers without notice.\n\nIf you are planning to go on a driving tour, bring a good map, then, if you want any hope of following the numbered routes. Most rental car offices hand out a map with a rental; if you didn't get one, the same map can be picked up at most stores. The one in the back of your guidebook is likely not detailed enough. However, even if you do have a map, you may still have to ask a local for directions. If you are in this situation, be aware that any question such as \"How do I get to Route 30?\" will be almost universally met with a blank stare. The route numbers are mostly for tourist convenience; locals ",{"type":"''","value":["do not"]}," know the numbers, or even the road names in most cases.

Goods are imported to the island duty and excise free, and visitors do not directly pay any duty or tax on purchases (merchants do pay a Gross Receipts Tax of 5%.)  Buyers may face Customs duty as they return home if they exceed their Customs exemption (see discussion below).\n\nU.S. currency is used\/accepted universally.  ATMs can be found in numerous locations. As anywhere, major purchases should be made by credit card.  (Credit cards issued by U.S. banks do not induce foreign-exchange fees, others may.)  Most store-front establishments, resorts and restaurants accept credit cards and traveler checks. Few places accept personal checks.  Sellers in open-air bazaars may not accept credit or debit cards.\n\nYou can shop many dozens of stores downtown (in ",{"type":"'''","value":["Charlotte Amalie"]},"), and others in a few malls dotting the island, and near cruise ship docks, e.g.,:\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["buy"],["name=Havensight"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/havensightmall.com\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Has many of the same shops as downtown, but in smaller versions."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Yacht Haven Grande"]}," next to Havensight offers restaurants and premium branded stores."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Crown Bay"]}," has a modest number of stores similar to Havensight (most closed when no ship is docked there) ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/viport.com\/cbc\/"]},"."]},{"type":"*","value":["  You'll see Pueblo Supermarkets (modest by mainland standards) near Havensight and Crown Bay."]},"\nYou'll find numerous tent kiosks at ",{"type":"'''","value":["Vendor's Plaza"]}," at the near southeast side of downtown...across the highway from the waterfront.  There you'll see many colorful offerings in shirts, caftans, rainwear, etc., often marked with USVI scenes or logos, most manufactured elsewhere.  Other stores in resorts, strip malls, etc., tend to serve locals and land vacationers; many of them open on Sundays whether cruise ships are visiting or not, e.g., K-Mart (one walkable from Havensight, & a larger store in ",{"type":"'''","value":["Tutu Park"]}," that also has a Cost-U-Less grocer nearby.\n\nGems, jewelry, watches, liquor, cosmetics, perfumes, linens and (sometimes) cameras, optics, electronics and fine crystal and china can be good buys, but know the costs for the same\/similar items back home.  (Some cameras, optics and electronics may be obtained at home from aggressive discounters (e.g., on Internet) for equivalent or lower prices.  But those savings can disappear if those sellers charge sales tax, shipping costs, or extra for US-importer warranties.)  Price advantages for U.S. citizens may be helped by generous duty exemptions.  These advantages can make the economics of buying in the USVI slightly better for U.S. citizens than elsewhere (e.g., St Martin) where prices may be similar, sometimes better.  However, unique, appealing or well-priced items seen elsewhere should not be avoided because of feared duty costs...often modest even if you exceed your exemption.  (see \"Customs and Duty\", this section below)\n\nBargaining is appropriate in open-air bazaars, and should be tried in stores but may be rebuffed in a few for some kinds of items.  Here, ensure that items of interest that need any kind of (service) warranty have one in writing that is ",{"type":"''","value":["usable at home"]},", e.g., for electronics, watches, cameras.  You need to ask if any warranty is \"grey-market\", international or backed by the US-importer, and understand the consequences of what's offered.  For valuable gems or jewelry, ensure the seller provides a written description and certified appraisal of each item's worth.\n\nIn exchange for very large fees, \"port shopping advisers\" on cruise ships tout certain merchants as more reliable than others, with passenger satisfaction \"guaranteed, except for negligence or buyer's regret\".  But most stores are quite reputable, ready to rectify any problem that's truly their responsibility.  Touted or not, smaller retailers such as Artistic Jewelry and Mr. Tablecloth offer quality fully-equivalent to such large and famous stores as Cardow or A.H. Riise.  And they may offer items seen nowhere else.  The best approach...always thoroughly inspect any high-cost item and obtain a written description or appraisal before accepting it.\n\nPer \"Get In\" discussion above, when many cruise ships are in port, the open-air bazaar and stores can be crowded...sometimes very crowded.  That can compromise bargaining success and how well you are helped even in the best stores with fine staffs. Shopping early or late can help avoid some of the crowds.  Stores downtown (Charlotte Amalie) usually open at 0930-1000 and close around 5:00 PM.  Half-day, morning ship's tours (the most popular) end about noon back at the ship, and ship itineraries often call for departures at 4-6 PM (with all-aboard as much as an hour earlier).  You might time your shopping accordingly.  \n\nOn Sunday, early can be essential.  A few stores (mostly in downtown Charlotte Amalie) don't open, more open only if at least one cruise ship is in port, and many of those stores close by early-mid afternoon.  Occasionally, local holidays\/festivals make shopping downtown problematic due to street and store closures, e.g., for parades.  Most carnivals\/celebrations are in late April & early May.\n\nEspecially if you must fly to get home, you may wish to have stores ship out-sized or heavy items home for you (liquor, perfumes and tobacco excluded).  Costs for surface shipping can be modest, air a bit more but faster.  (Your local Post Office, UPS or FEDEX store should be able to give you example costs.  \"Know Before You Go\" noted below indicates the US Postal Service is more convenient for sending dutiable items.)  Any method helps avoid the dangers of damage (or theft) by baggage handlers, greatly simplifies your return home, and allows you to refuse to accept (at\/hear home) any shipment that appears damaged.  There are requirements for documentation and customs labeling when shipping dutiable items.  Retailers should help, and may even arrange everything.  If significant customs duty will be involved, you may have to pay it at\/near home as you receive the item(s).  But ask the merchant if you can simply declare the item on your Customs form as you return home.\n\nSeveral stores offer large and varied selections of quality and premium liquors at low prices rarely if ever seen in the U.S.  They include: A.H. Riise, Dynasty and others downtown; many of the same in Havensight, plus K-Mart, Pueblo Supermarket and Al Cohen's Warehouse near Havensight; A.H. Riise and Supreme Liquors at Crown Bay, with another Pueblo Supermarket nearby.  As of Spring 2011, prices in most stores for popular brands were quite close except for scattered \"specials\".  Prices for highly-premium brands can vary more.  The airport now has stores outside and inside the secure area (airside) (see discussion under \"Returning home\" below).  Most liquor comes in one liter bottles (some larger), some US-produced liquors come in .75 liter (\"fifths\"), and liqueurs may be in still other sizes.  So take care when calculating or comparing cost per ounce or liter.\n\nSome of those stores will box your purchases and deliver them to your ship, hotel or airport the same day at no charge if you ask and purchase early enough.  That way, you don't have to carry them with you the rest of the day.  Others (e.g., K-Mart, Cohen's) usually have boxes available, and may box bottles for you to carry.  (Boxes\/boxing and delivery may be the major difference among sellers.)  If you have a choice, smaller boxes (e.g., 2-4 bottles each) are easier to pack and pad in luggage.  As discussed in \"Returning Home\" below, large purchases of liquor induce considerable logistics challenges, so plan ahead on what to buy and how to carry it back, especially if you must fly home.
