The best beaches and most populated areas are on the western and southern coasts, with the north and east being rugged and mountainous.\n\nBecause only one branch of the US Military - the Coast Guard - has even a small permanent presence on Saipan, many Chamorros on Saipan consider their culture more intact than on Guam. Therefore, comparisons between the two islands should take this into account. Furthermore, Chamorros on Saipan and throughout the CNMI still primarily speak Chamorro at home, while the same isn't true of Guam.  While the differences between a commonwealth (as in the CNMI) and a territory (as in Guam) may not appear to be great (especially to a mainland US citizen), Saipan should not be referred to as a territory when speaking to a local. Finally, while the population of the CNMI, as on Guam, are US citizens and proud to be recognized as such, their independent identity is equally important.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nWhile English is certainly the lingua franca on Saipan, few people on the island (adults in particular) speak English as their first language.  Nevertheless, nearly everybody does speak English to varying degrees. Many local residents, who often use English at school or at work, speak Chamorro or Carolinian (both official in addition to English) or another of the Micronesian languages at home. The majority of people living on Saipan are overseas contract laborers, however. These people come mostly from the Philippines, China, Bangladesh, and South Korea. A small Thai population also exists on the island. Furthermore, Korean, Japanese and (more recently) Russian and Chinese tourists make their languages fairly prevalent in the tourist areas as well.\n\nMost hotels are geared toward a particular language\/nationality such as Japanese or Korean, which represent most of the tourism. A notable exception is Pacific Islands Club, which is geared toward a multilingual\/multinationial clientele. Likewise, most of the SCUBA shops are geared toward Japanese or Korean tourism, though the heavy reliance on Philippine dive staff ensures that many will also be able to handle English-speaking customers.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Saipan-Tinian.jpg"],["thumb"],["400px"],["Map of Saipan and Tinian"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Saipan International Airport"]}," (",{"type":"'''","value":["SPN"]},") is located in the southeast corner of the island.

There will be direct flights from Shanghai and Guangzhou China starting early 2011 by Sichuan Airlines.\n\nU.S. travelers required passports and had to pass through CNMI Immigration and Customs, as Saipan and the CNMI were considered international locations until November 28, 2009. On that date the CNMI Covenant required that the CNMI Federalization of Immigration law became effective. The CNMI remains under CNMI Customs laws.\n\nThe Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands\nin Political Union with the United States of America defines the unique relationship between the Northern Mariana Islands and the United States, recognizing U.S. sovereignty but limiting, in some respects, applicability of federal law. The Covenant was negotiated over the course of twenty-seven months (December 1972 to February 1975) by the Marianas Political Status Commission (an organization representing the Northern Mariana Islands) and a delegation representing the United States. The proposed Covenant was signed by negotiators on February 15, 1975, at Saipan. The Covenant is codified at 48 U.S.C. § 1801 note, reprinted in the Northern Mariana Islands Commonwealth Code (with case annotations) and is also sold in pamphlet format by the Commonwealth Law Revision Commission.\n\nPursuant to Section 1003(a), some Covenant provisions became effective on March 24, 1976, the date of final approval. Remaining provisions took effect on January 9, 1978, and November 4, 1986, the dates specified in Presidential proclamations issued pursuant to Section 1003(b)-(c). On the latter date, qualified residents of the Northern Mariana Islands became U.S. citizens. On June 29, 2009 U.S. Immigration Laws were to take effect, however, they were delayed until November 28, 2009.\n\nU.S. Public Law 94-241, § 1, Mar. 24, 1976, 90 Stat. 263, the measure approving the Covenant, was originally reprinted in the U.S. Code in a note under 48 U.S.C. § 1681. In an official edition of the U.S. Code published in 1986, several provisions of the act were codified (as amended) as 48 U.S.C. §§ 1801-1805. (See also C-201 et seq.)\n\nThe Covenant is an agreement entered into between the United States government and the government and people of the Northern Mariana Islands. The parties entered into agreement as two separate but equal sovereign entities. The Covenant governs the relationship between the parties.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThere is no public transport as such, excluding shuttle buses running between hotels and the Duty Free shopping center in Garapan.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nThere is no public bus service on Saipan, but on Saipan PDI and other companies run a shopping shuttle bus to and from the Duty Free mall (DFS Galleria) in Garapan.

There is also a large network of illegal taxis run by Chinese and Korean immigrants, that will take you anywhere for less than $5.00. For some Saipan residents this is their only means of transportation.\n\nBecause Saipan is so small, taxis from the airport to the main hotel area of Garapan can run upwards of $25-30, so plan ahead by arranging transportation through your hotel, which often charge $10 per person flat rate.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Car rental"]]}," is a good option for getting off the beaten track, as roads are generally quite good.
