It has an area of 9,605 square kilometres, mostly in the Phu Phan mountains. It has many forest temple meditation retreats. \n\nSakon Nakhon is a Buddhist town with five Buddhist stupas. Its history dates back three thousand years. Legend says that Nongharn town, or presently Sakon Nakhon, was built in 11th century when the Khmer ruled this region. When the Khmer lost their power, the town was under the rules of Lanxang or Laotian Kingdom. It was renamed “Muang Chiang Mai Nongharn”. When the town joined Siam, it was renamed again as “Sakon Thavapi”. In 1830, during the reign of King Rama III, it was renamed “Sakon Nakhon”.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Languages"]},"\nA mix of Thai and Lao is spoken in Sakon Nakhon.
