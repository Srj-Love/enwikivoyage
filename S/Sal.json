Santa Maria is a developing destination and has many construction projects but looking beyond that, there are beautiful beaches, many restaurants, bars and hotels and a relaxed atmosphere.  The main focal points are the pier and the town square, the new residential district is at the eastern end of town which also has a small beach and is the focus of a lot of surfing and windsurfing activity.  The larger hotels are at the western end, where you will also find the famous dunes and beach of Ponta Preta.  This is also where many new resorts are being built.  Further north on the west coast is Murdeira, a residential village.  Palmeira is the main port and has a few bars and restaurants but no accommodation.  One or two hotels can be found in Espargos which also has larger food shops than Santa Maria. Pedra de Lume is a small fishing village which is earmarked for a golf resort and marina and is also close to the old Salinas which is a candidate world heritage site.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=In Cape Verde"],["url=http:\/\/incapeverde.com"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=For self catering villa and apartments bookable direct with their owners."]]}]},{"type":"===","value":["High end"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Hotel Morabeza"],["url=http:\/\/www.hotelmorabeza.com"],["email=info@hotelmorabeza.com"],["address="],["lat=16.597906"],["long=-22.909284"],["directions="],["phone=(+238) 242 10 20"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=A pleasant resort with a great beachfront."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Cape_Verde"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Sal, Cape Verde"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["16.737222222222"],["-22.936111111111"]]}]
