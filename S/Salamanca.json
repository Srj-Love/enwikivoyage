Traditional family owned stores mix with many national and international retailers throughout the city.  Calle Toro, which begins at the northwest corner of the Plaza Mayor, in particular has many options for shoppers.  \n\nThe city also boasts a mall (",{"type":"''","value":["centro commercial"]},") which offers variety of stores and restaurants.  However a car, bus or taxi ride is needed to access it.  \n\nMost stores open around 10AM, close for two or three hours during lunch time (2PM) and remain open until 9 PM.  Almost all stores, including grocery stores, are closed on Sundays.  There are a few convenience stores, known as 24 hour stores, which never close.\n\nEvery Sunday an out-door market, known as the Rastro, erects where locals and tourists alike shop for assorted products: clothes, jackets, hats, bags, jewelry, watches, perfumes, colognes, and other accessories. The Rastro is located on Av. de la Aldehuela, about 2 miles west of Plaza Mayor, roughly a 20 minute walk.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nLunch is Spain's big meal of the day, and Salamanca abides by that rule religiously.

In Salamanca there's no definitive guide to ",{"type":"''","value":["tapa-ing"]},", instead, try to stroll around the center of the town and try different places and, who knows, meet new friends.\n\nLocals gather slightly north of city center for their nightly tapas on a street named Van Dyck.  The tapas here are generally of a higher quality and a lower price of those found near the plaza.  Almost every street out from the center will have at least one small bar, and many of them will serve tapas. The price difference between having or not a tapa with your drink is negligible (around 2€ for each beer\/wine+tapa, 20-30 cts less only the beer) so go on a try them!\n\nPopular tapas are any sort of roasted pork parts: ribs (costilla), sausage (chorizo), ham (jamon), bacon (panceta) or face (jeta). Try the \"pincho moruno\", a brochette of pork pieces marinated in paprika and garlic. A local speciality (if you find it appealing) is \"chanfaina\" a spicy rice dish with liver and\/or blood that is served in many bars as a tapa on Sundays.  \n\nIn the summer most restaurants set tables outside for both lunch and dinner.  Be forewarned that with the privilege of sitting outside you often get charged a euro or two extra per person. \n\nSalamanca is atop the small portion of Spain where you can purchase ",{"type":"''","value":["jamon iberia"]}," (Iberian ham).
