Police cars are adorned with witch logos, a local public school is known as the Witchcraft Heights Elementary School, the Salem High School athletic teams are named the Witches; and Gallows Hill, a site of numerous public hangings, is currently used as a playing field for various sports. Tourists know Salem as a mix of important historical sites, New Age and Wiccan boutiques, kitschy Halloween, witch-themed attractions and a vibrant downtown that a large number of restaurants, cafes and coffee shops. The 15th Annual Retailers Association of Massachusetts awarded Salem as the best place to shop in 2012\n\nHome to Salem State University, the Salem Willows Park and the Peabody Essex Museum, Salem is a residential and tourist area which includes the neighborhoods of Salem Neck, The Point, South Salem and North Salem, Witchcraft Heights, Pickering Wharf, and the McIntire Historic District (named after Salem's famous architect and carver, Samuel McIntire). Salem was one of the most significant seaports in early America and during the American Revolution, Salem became a center for privateering. Although the documentation is incomplete, about 1,700 Letters of Marque, issued on a per-voyage basis, were granted during the American Revolution. Nearly 800 vessels were commissioned as privateers and are credited with capturing or destroying about 600 British ships.  By 1790, Salem had become the sixth largest city in the country, and a world-famous seaport—particularly in the China Trade, along with exporting codfish to Europe and the West Indies, importing sugar and molasses from the West Indies, tea from China, and products depicted on the city seal from the East Indies – in particular Sumatran pepper. Salem ships also visited Africa – Zanzibar in particular, Russia, Japan, and Australia.  The Old China Trade left a significant mark in two historic districts, Chestnut Street District, part of the Samuel McIntire Historic District containing 407 buildings, and the Salem Maritime National Historic Site, consisting of 12 historic structures and about 9 acres (36,000 m2) of land along the waterfront in Salem. Elias Hasket Derby was among the wealthiest and most celebrated of post-Revolutionary merchants in Salem, and owner of the Grand Turk, the first New England vessel to trade directly with China.\n\nIn 1637 the first muster was held on Salem Common, where for the first time a regiment of militia drilled for the common defense of a multi-community area, thus laying the foundation for what became the Army National Guard.  President Barack Obama signed into law on the 10th of January 2013 signed executive order HR1339 \"which designates the City of Salem, Mass., as the birthplace of the U.S. National Guard.\"  Each April, the Second Corps of Cadets gather in front of Saint. Peter's Episcopal Church, where their founder, Stephen Abbott, is buried. They lay a wreath, play \"Taps\" and fire a 21-gun salute. In another annual commemoration, soldiers gather at Old Salem Armory to honor soldiers who were killed in the Battles of Lexington and Concord. On April 14, 2012, Salem celebrated the 375th anniversary of the first muster on Salem Common with more than 1,000 troops taking part in ceremonies and a parade.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Logan International Airport"]},", +1-800-23-LOGAN (56426), ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.massport.com\/logan"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["BOS"]]},") in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boston"]]},".

The house was bought by Judge Corwin in 1675, when he was 24 years old, and he lived there for more than forty years. Corwin is buried in the nearby Broad Street Cemetery. The house remained in the Corwin family until the mid-19th century. The Witch House is located at 310 Essex Street, at the cross streets of North & Summer in the Chestnut Street District of Salem.  The house is now a museum operated by the City of Salem, and is open seasonally.  As a local magistrate and civic leader, Corwin was called upon to investigate the claims of diabolical activity when a surge of witchcraft accusations arose in Salem and neighboring communities. He took the place of Judge Nathaniel Saltonstall, who resigned after the execution of Bridget Bishop. Corwin served on the Court of Oyer and Terminer, which ultimately sent nineteen to the gallows. All nineteen refused to admit to witchcraft and maintained their innocence. The house is an excellent example of 17th-century architecture, but historians have not come to a conclusion as to precisely when it was built. Jonathan Corwin's descendants claim the house was built in 1642. Some Victorian scholars alleged that the house was built between 1620–1630, and that Roger Williams, the founder of Rhode Island resided in the house in the 1630s.  However most historians now believe the house was built in the 1660s or 1670s.  Despite rumors to the contrary, no interrogations or trials were ever conducted in the Witch House. There are no documents in which an accused is demanded to be brought to Judge Corwin's home, nor is it likely the judge would have used his own home as a place to conduct legal proceedings of this nature. Interrogations were done at either the Old Meetinghouse or Ingersall's Tavern.  The house was moved about 35 feet (11 m) to its current location in the 1940s when the adjacent street was widened. At this time the house was restored to look as it would have in the 17th Century and the gambrel roof was altered."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Pickering House"],["url=http:\/\/www.pickeringhouse.org"],["email="],["address=18 Broad Street"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=The oldest continuously lived-in house (by the same family) in Salem"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Salem Witch Village"],["url=http:\/\/www.salemwitchvillage.biz"],["email="],["address=282 Derby Street"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +1 978-740-9229"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Attractions & Museums, Gift Shops"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Witch Dungeon Museum"],["url=http:\/\/www.witchdungeon.com"],["email="],["address=16 Lynde Street"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +1 978-741-3570"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Attractions & Museums, Gift Shops"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Witch History Museum"],["url=http:\/\/www.witchhistorymuseum.com"],["email="],["address=197-201 Essex Street"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +1 978-741-7770"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Arts & Entertainment, Attractions & Museums"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Salem Visitor Center"],["url="],["email="],["address=2 New Liberty Street"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 978 740-1650"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Daily 9AM-5PM"],["price="],["content=Film on the history of Essex county.

Salem, one of the largest towns in the British American colonies, was the sixth largest city in the United States in 1790 and the richest per capita due mostly to its early involvement in post-Revolution international maritime commerce, especially with India and the Far East. Due to this rich history, and Salem's subsequent decline from its post-Revolutionary pre-eminence, the city is a treasure trove of post-medieval, Georgian, Federal, Greek-Revival, and Victorian architecture (the French Second Empire Style in Particular). There are many historic districts in Salem, the largest is the The Chestnut Street District, a historic district bounded roughly by Broad, Flint, Federal, and Summer Streets in Salem, Massachusetts, also known as the McIntyre Historic District that was created in 1981 and containing 407 buildings and is the city's largest district. This historic district is named after Samuel McIntire. Samuel McIntire had a house and workshop that was located 31 Summer Street, at the intersection of Chestnut Street where many grand mansions designed by McIntire and others display the profits of the Old China Trade.  A short 10 minute walk from the Chestnut Street District, the Salem Maritime National Historic Site consists of 12 historic structures and about 9 acres (36,000 m2) of land along the waterfront in Salem, Massachusetts.

The original was a three-masted East Indiaman trading ship, originally built in 1797, which travelled the world over a dozen times and returned to Salem after each voyage with goods from all over the world.

The islands' name come from shipbuilder Robert Moulton who was stranded on the islands during a winter storm in the 1620s.  The island, in the past, has been home to a club with a golf course and subsequently about two dozen cottages.  The island is now uninhabited.  A short walk from the Salem Maritime National Historic Site are the Chestnut Street District, Federal Street District, Downtown Salem District, Bridge Street Neck Historic District, Charter Street Historic District, Crombie Street District, Derby Waterfront District, Essex Institute Historic District,  Salem Willows Historic District, Old Town Hall Historic District & the  Salem Common Historic District.
