You can view it from up top but the best experience is to take the short hike down the hill where you can walk behind the falls. There is a 7 mile hike passing by 10 waterfalls ending at another parking lot at the North Falls. Although smaller than the South Falls it is still stunning. You can rent cabins or if you like to ride they have a beautiful horse camp with many trails to enjoy."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=I-5.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["directionl1=N"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Portland (Oregon)"],["Portland"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lake Oswego"]]}],["directionr1=S"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Eugene"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Albany (Oregon)"],["Albany"]]}],["image2=OR 22.svg"],["imagesize2=22"],["directionl2=W"],["majorl2=Junction with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:US 101.svg"],["18px"]]}],["minorl2=Junction with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:OR 18.svg"],["18px"]]}],["directionr2=E"],["majorr2=Junction with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:US 20.svg"],["18px"]]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:OR 126.svg"],["18px"]]}],["minorr2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Detroit (Oregon)"],["Detroit"]]}],["image3=OR 99E.svg"],["imagesize3=22"],["directionl3=N"],["majorl3=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Portland (Oregon)"],["Portland"]]}],["minorl3=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oregon City"]]}],["directionr3=S"],["majorr3=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Eugene"]]}],["minorr3=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Albany (Oregon)"],["Albany"]]}],["image4=OR 213.svg"],["imagesize4=22"],["directionl4=W"],["majorl4=Junction with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:I-5.svg"],["18px"]]}],["minorl4="],["directionr4=E"],["majorr4=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Portland (Oregon)"],["Portland"]]}],["minorr4=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Silverton (Oregon)"],["Silverton"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Salem, Oregon"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["44.930833"],["-123.028889"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Willamette Valley"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usablecity"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North_America\/United_States\/Oregon\/Localities\/S\/Salem\/"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Salem, Oregon"]]}]
