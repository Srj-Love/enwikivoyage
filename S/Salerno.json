For a brief period (February to August 1944) Salerno was the capital city of Italy, during the liberation after the allied landings before the fall of Monte Cassino to the allies and the subsequent liberation of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rome"]]},".\n\nToday it is a lively port town, that is rapidly re-acquiring a relaxing and open Mediterranean atmosphere. The port area itself is not particularly attractive, but once you get onto the promenade things get better. Worth a visit also is the Historical Old Town, which has in recent years recovered from being a virtual no-go area to being one of the best preserved  historical town centers, full of tiny little passageways and hidden corners.\n\nSalerno was the birthplace of the \"Schola Medica Salernitana\" in the ninth century, which was the most important source of medical information in Europe at the time, and provided an important impulse to medical learning in Europe.\n\nSalerno is an ideal stopping off point on the way to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Paestum"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pompeii"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Positano"]]},", or the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cilento and Vallo di Diano National Park"]]},", which is a lesser known ",{"type":"[[","value":[["UNESCO World Heritage List"],["UNESCO World Heritage"]]}," site. Placed as it is at one end of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amalfi Coast"]]},"line, it is an important passing point for the local tourism scene.\n\nAlso worth a visit if you happen to be in the area are ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vietri sul Mare"]]},", for the traditional ceramics, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cava de' Tirreni"]]}," for the important Abbey at La Badia and one of the few remaining Portici in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Campania"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nThe nearest International Airport is Capodichino (code NAP) ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.gesac.it\/en\/"]},". Once you have arrived, you'll have to take one of the methods listed below to cover the final leg of the journey.\n\nFrom the airport you can take a bus for €3 (called Alibus) to Stazione Centrale in Naples (get off here for connections to Salerno via train). It also stops on Piazza Municipio near the ferry port, from which you can take a 5-minute walk to catch the Bus (SITA). The route is not obvious, so see the section below.\n\nYou can buy your ticket on the Alibus, and you can get to it by walking right out of the airport terminal to the bus stop which is less than 20 metres from the airport terminal exit.\n\nFrom Naples Airport there is a SITA bus running directly to Salerno (Euros 7). This bus runs only 4 times a day, and not on Sunday. You have to walk some 300 meters to reach the bus-\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\nSalerno is a stop for high speed trains operated by both Trenitalia and Italo, giving a convenient connection to most major Italian cities.\n\nFrom Naples, you can also reach Salerno on Regional trains from Napoli Centrale which take about 50 minutes, or on some Metropolitan trains making several stops in Naples including Piazza Garibaldi (80 minutes from Salerno).  For both of these, you can use a Unico Campania U-5 ticket, which you can buy for €4.10 from various stores and kiosks around the station.  The 3T 3-day tourist transit pass also includes these trains.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["BY rental car"]},"\n\nTheoretically, you can rent a car to cover the last stretch of the journey, but in all honesty it's probably better to reserve this option for second (or third) visits to the area if you are used to driving in Northern Europe or the US. The reason for this is that driving habits in this area of Italy have developed in a sort of local micro climate - most cars drift around on the motorway hovering between two or three lanes, most drivers talk and gesticulate instead of driving, and if you don't keep up with the traffic flow, you are likely to find someone tailgating you within 30 seconds or so.\n\nIf you need any more convincing, take a look at the cars when you arrive in the area. There is a prize if you can spot one without dents. Dents and rental cars don't mix well.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["From Naples"]},"\n\nBe aware that you have to cross the road here, and that traffic in Naples follows unwritten rules that are not accessible to foreigners (or even some Italians). Red traffic lights don't always stop the traffic (the locals know the 'important' traffic lights, and will stop at these). Mopeds regularly leave the road and drive on any other surface they can find. Follow the locals, and you should be OK.\n\nYou should ask the way to the \"SITA\" (the name of the bus company that provides the service). If you stand where the bus stops, and face the sea (with the tall castle to your right), you will need to cross the main road and head towards the left. After about 400 meters or so, you will see a small congregation of buses to your right. Check the destination written on the bus, or you can ask for \"Salerno\".\n\nThe service is quite rapid for the first part of the journey, but then will leave the motorway and take a more tortuous route. The journey should take an hour so so. The ticket should cost between €3 and €4 per person.\n\nFor further journeys there is a regional ticket that allows you to travel with the bus (timed limit) or train (one journey): see ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Campania#Get around"],["Campania Unico"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["From the Amalfi coast"]},"\n\nYou can catch a bus from the amalfi coast to Salerno, which runs along the winding roads of the coastline. The drivers are very experienced and swing effortlessly round the curves (they don't have special powers to see round corners, if you look closely, there are mirrors at strategic points). In the height of summer expect long delays, as tourist cars and buses tend to get overwhelmed by the road, and vice versa. Much better to go by boat.
