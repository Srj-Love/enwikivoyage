Although the City of Salford borders with the City of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Manchester"]]},", in part along the River Irwell and in the inner city, where Strangeways borders Broughton and Higher Broughton borders Cheetham Hill, it is a city in its own right (as its more loyal, long term residents will often let you know if you give them a reason). To incomers, this loyalty is a little less pronounced, as it remains, in many ways, a city without its own centre. Manchester's influence remains strong and the boundary meanders through the middle of shopping districts, such as on Bury Old Road in Cheetham Hill, bisects businesses and even goes through party walls in places. Many people, who move to the area, have a Greater Manchester perspective. The city is extremely diverse, ranging from an urban city centre environment at its immediate border with the City of Manchester, into suburbia and then into open fields at semi-rural ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Worsley"]]},".

Direct trains serve Salford Crescent from the Airport's railway station. However, to reach most parts of the city, the best option would be to take a train to Manchester city centre and take a tram from Piccadilly, a train from Piccadilly or Victoria to the relevant suburban stop, or a bus.\n\nLiverpool John Lennon Airport is located approximately 30miles to the West of Salford and can be reached by car, via the M62, or by coach, which stops at Manchester Chorlton Street and Eccles without the need for pre-booking.
