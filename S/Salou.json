[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Salou"]}," (Greek: Salauris) is a municipality of the comarca of Tarragon√®s, in the province of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tarragona"]]},", in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Catalonia"]]},", Spain. The city is approximately 10km from Tarragona and Reus on the Costa Daurada and 112km from Barcelona. Salou is the tourist capital of the Costa Dorada, due to its many tourist facilities and its beautiful beaches; it is a popular holiday destination due to its Mediterranean climate. Aside from its string of beaches interrupted by rocky coves, and its landscaped promenade, one of its main attractions is the Port Aventura resort, formerly owned by Universal Parks & Resorts, the theme park division of NBCUniversal. Salou was famous for its permanent fairground at the end of the promenade. Salou is used as the base for the Catalunyan round of the World Rally Championship. The Dutch movie, Costa! and the television series with the same title were both filmed in Salou.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nUsed as a port by Greeks and Romans, it appeared again in an important historic event, when in 1229 the fleet of James I of Aragon departed from the port of Salou to conquer the Balearic islands, thus creating the Kingdom of Majorca and in 1286 Alfons III of Aragon also departed from this port to conquer Minorca, the last muslim territory of the Balearic Islands. Later, Salou became a nest of pirates. After that it was considered an unsafe place, so in 1530 Archbishop of Tarragona decided to erect a new defence tower, now called Torre Vella. In 1865 the railway station began to operate, opening a new development time, that led one hundred years later to a tourist boom that has brought prosperity to the town. Salou was segregated from Vila-seca on 30 October 1989 by a decision of the Supreme Court of Spain. It is considered the capital and most popular destination of the Costa Daurada.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" By car, from the highway AP-7."]},{"type":"*","value":[" By plane, from the international airport Reus-Salou or Barcelona El Prat Airport."]},{"type":"*","value":[" By train, with RENFE ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.renfe.com\/EN\/"]}," medium-distance trains from Barcelona via Tarragona.
