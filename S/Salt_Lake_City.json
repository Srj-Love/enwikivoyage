The city quickly became a major transit point for folks moving westward in the midst of the California Gold Rush, and the Mormon church's extensive network of missionaries drew converts from Britain, Ireland, and Scandinavia to Salt Lake City throughout the 1850s and '60s in long \"handcart treks\", a tradition now deeply ingrained in Mormon culture. Pacific Islanders were heavily recruited as well, and Salt Lake City retains an unusually large Pacific Islander population to this day. The handcart tradition ended somewhat abruptly in 1869 with the arrival of the first transcontinental railroad, which, combined with the rise of mining and industry, brought the first major influx of non-Mormons moving into the city as permanent residents.\n\nAlthough the majority of Utahns are still members of the LDS Church, Salt Lake City itself is less than 50% Mormon, with some areas, such as those dominated by ethnic minorities and artsy neighborhoods like Sugarhouse, bearing little resemblance to the Mormon-dominated culture in other parts of Utah.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Gallivan Center skating.jpg"],["thumb"],["Gallivan Center skating rink during the winter."]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Imperial"],["janhigh = 37"],["febhigh = 43"],["marhigh = 52"],["aprhigh = 62"],["mayhigh = 72"],["junhigh = 83"],["julhigh = 92"],["aughigh = 90"],["sephigh = 80"],["octhigh = 66"],["novhigh = 50"],["dechigh = 39"],["janlow = 20"],["feblow = 24"],["marlow = 31"],["aprlow = 38"],["maylow = 46"],["junlow = 54"],["jullow = 62"],["auglow = 61"],["seplow = 51"],["octlow = 40"],["novlow = 30"],["declow = 22"],["janprecip = 1.3"],["febprecip = 1.2"],["marprecip = 1.8"],["aprprecip = 2"],["mayprecip = 1.8"],["junprecip = 0.9"],["julprecip = 0.7"],["augprecip = 0.8"],["sepprecip = 1.1"],["octprecip = 1.3"],["novprecip = 1.3"],["decprecip = 1.3"],["description = ",{"type":"{{","value":[["ForecastNOAA"],["Salt Lake City"],["40.75961"],["-111.8882"]]}]]},"\n\nThe climate of Salt Lake City is extremely seasonal. Summers are long, hot, and dry; winters are cold and snowy; fall and spring are shorter and marked by annoyingly inconsistent temperatures. Precipitation is low, averaging about 14-20 inches (350–500 mm) a year measured as liquid water, though much of it falls as light, fluffy snow that can pile up several inches high. Total snowfall averages around 50-80 inches (125–200 cm) annually.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Winter (mid-November to early March):"]}," Winter brings poor weather to Salt Lake City, and tourism this time of year is typically focused on using the city as a base for exploring ski resorts in the nearby mountains. Daytime temperatures run from 25°F to 50°F (-4-10°C). Overnight lows are below freezing more often than not, and on some occasions will even drop below 0°F (-18°C). Snow is common, but severe blizzards are almost non-existent, and it's rare for a storm to drop enough snow to shut down or cripple the city. Light snow is handled as a daily occurance, with the city continuing to operate as normal. There is plenty of variation in snowfall between different parts of the city thanks to the mountainside topography, with higher elevations getting much more snow than lower neighborhoods. The difference is drastic enough that the local weather report will often include separate snow predictions for the benches and the valley floor.\n\nWhile the snow can inconvenience travelers, the worst part of winter in the Salt Lake Valley is a phenomenon called an inversion, where cold, heavy air gets trapped between the mountains and stagnates, collecting more and more pollution for days or even weeks on end. This leads to some of the worst air quality conditions found in the United States, and is only cleared out when the next storm comes through.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Spring (early March to late May):"]}," Spring in Salt Lake is mild overall, but it is also the windiest and rainiest time of year, and it can be tough to tell when the last snowstorm is behind you even after the ground accumulation has been melted away for weeks. High temperatures during spring range from around 45°F to 80°F (7-27°C). Low temperatures are generally cool, and may still drop below freezing once or twice in April. Although it's the rainiest time of year, spring in Salt Lake City is still dry compared to many cities in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Midwest (United States of America)"],["Midwest"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mid-Atlantic"]]},", or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New England"]]}," regions. Rainstorms will mostly be light or moderate in severity and many of them will last just a few minutes. Sunny spring days, which are fairly common, bring some of the nicest weather you will encounter in Salt Lake City at any time of year. However, this mostly applies to the valley as the mountain snowpack won't recede until late May or June, leaving outdoor activities such as camping and hiking unavailable until summer. Ski resorts near Salt Lake City will remain open part way through spring, with most of them operating until mid-April and Snowbird staying open even later.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Summer (late May to mid-September):"]}," Summers in Salt Lake City are long, hot, and dry. Maximum daily temperatures during this season range anywhere between 80°F and 105°F (27-41°C). Humidity is low and nights are warm, sometimes hot. Although summer is a very dry season here, powerful Pacific storms will sometimes impact the city as late as the beginning of June, prolonging the rainy season and keeping temperatures a bit cooler. In particular, mid-June through early July is clear, dry, and sun-baked. From mid-July through mid-September the monsoon affects northern Utah, bringing somewhat frequent evening thunderstorms to the Salt Lake area. These thunderstorms are usually short-lived, but can sometimes bring moderate hail to the valleys and much worse rain and hail to the mountains. If you avoid these thunderstorms, summer is a great time for outdoor recreation in the mountains. Temperatures are cooler in the mountains and can be comfortable even during the worst heat waves in the valleys.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Autumn (mid-September to mid-November):"]}," Autumn is a nice time to visit Salt Lake City. It's warm and typically drier than spring, with temperatures ranging from 45°F to 80°F (7-27°C) during the daytime. Pacific storms begin impacting the area around mid-October, but aren't too frequent. While storms can start dropping snow in the mountains again, the snowpack generally doesn't begin building up until November or December. The first light snow and freezing overnight temperatures in the valley will sometimes occur before the beginning of November, and by mid-to-late November, snowfall and freezing temperatures must be prepared for. The leaves on the trees in the mountains reach their peak of brilliant color around mid-to-late September and a month or so afterwards in the valleys.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Slc airport terminal 2.jpg"],["thumb"],["Terminal 2 at Salt Lake International Airport houses Delta Airlines."]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Slc airport trax station.jpg"],["thumb"],["TRAX airport station goes to the center of Salt Lake City from Terminal 1."]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Frontrunner north temple station.jpg"],["thumb"],["FrontRunner North Temple Station passes under the North Temple Bridge\/Guadalupe TRAX Station which takes riders to center of Salt Lake City and to the Salt Lake International Airport."]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Salt Lake City International Airport"],["url=http:\/\/www.slcairport.com"],["email="],["address=776 North Terminal Drive"],["lat=40.785806"],["long=-111.981203"],["directions="],["phone=+1 801-575-2400"],["tollfree=+1-800-595-2442"],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=(",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["SLC"]]},") Located on the western side of the city just off of I-80, Salt Lake serves as Delta Air Lines' mid-country hub, with over 120 daily departures for Delta alone.

Major streets run precisely east-to-west or north-to-south. Addresses are coordinates within the grid, and streets represent intervals of 100 in each direction. For example, the street five blocks east of the grid's center is called 500 East (commonly called '5th East' in spoken conversation) and 19 blocks south is 1900 South (or 19th South). This means that the cardinal directions mentioned in street names do not represent a direction you can drive on that street, and if the direction designation is the only difference between two street names, they are two completely different streets, unlike the common street naming system where North Main and South Main would be two halves of a contiguous road. Some streets will have both a name and a number designation; 300 South and Broadway are equally valid names for the same street, and the major thoroughfare of State Street is technically also 100 East. 100 North and 100 West are better known as North Temple and West Temple, as they border the northern and western edges of Temple Square. The only streets without number designations are the two streets that divide the quadrants of the grid: South Temple splits the northern and southern halves of the grid, while east and west addresses are measured from Main Street (formerly East Temple). Building addresses are numbered based on their position between the 100-interval streets at either end of the block: 629 South 1500 West would be between 6th South and 7th South on 15th West.\n\nStreets are an eighth of a mile apart downtown, but become more irregularly spaced as you move farther from the city center. Suburbs outside of the Salt Lake Valley often have their own grid systems modeled after Salt Lake's, but don't expect them to be well integrated with neighboring towns – a road may change numbers without warning as you cross an invisible local boundary. The Avenues neighborhood in the northeast corner of Salt Lake City also has its own street grid independent of the rest of the valley. This grid consists of east\/west avenues numbered 1 though 18 (1st Avenue is the farthest south) and north\/south streets lettered A through U (A Street is the farthest west).\n\nSalt Lake City is well served by ",{"type":"'''","value":["freeways"]},", with Interstate 15 running straight north-to-south through the city, right past downtown. I-80 shares a brief concurrency with I-15 in the southern half of the city, branching out westward across from downtown and eastward near the southern end of the city limits. The eastern portion serves the Sugarhouse neighborhood and residential areas, while the western portion passes near the airport. The I-215 belt route makes a three-quarters loop around Salt Lake City, skipping the northeastern quadrant due to mountains. It has a junction with I-80 just southeast of the airport. State Route 201 (\"SR 201\", the \"21st South Freeway\", the \"201 freeway\", or just \"the 201\"), heads west from I-15 into the suburbs of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["West Valley City"]]}," and Magna. The eastern terminus of SR 201 meets the southern end of the I-15\/I-80 concurrency in a massive interchange known as the \"Spaghetti Bowl\".\n\nLocal Utah drivers will generally know how to drive in snow, however, like anywhere, there are plenty of out-of-towners who don't.

State law mandates that cyclists signal audibly when overtaking a pedestrian on the sidewalk. Quite a few of the city's major attractions are accessible via bicycle, and it is quick and easy to get out to the university or the zoo on a bike.\n\nMany major streets have bicycle lanes and signs reminding motorists to share the road, but a lot of streets had these bike lanes added without widening the roadway, and thus leave cyclists without much buffer space between them and car traffic. It may be easiest to use residential side streets if one is available a block or two away. The wide streets in the city center don't help cyclists, as the extra lanes are all for cars and just make it trickier to cross the street on a bike.\n\nThere are a handful of off-road paths and mountain biking trails. The path following the banks of the Jordan River south of I-80 is well developed, but a bit desolate in some parts. City Creek Canyon is open to cyclists on select days.\n\nBicycles are allowed on UTA buses and trains, including both TRAX and FrontRunner.
