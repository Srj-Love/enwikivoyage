Salt Spring (sometimes spelled \"Saltspring\", one word) is the largest both in area and population of the Southern Gulf Islands.  The population has grown from about 10,000 to 13,000 in the past five years with the influx of baby boomer retirees (many Canadian-American from California) and Alberta oil patch money. There are many more seasonal and part-time residents.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nSalt Spring Island was first called Saltspring (one word) Island by Governor James Douglas in 1853.  He believed that the Salt Springs in the North of the Island would bring great wealth to the Island.  It was also known by a few other names during the early years: Klaathem (Cowichan Indian word for ",{"type":"''","value":["Salt"]},"), Chuam, Tuam, and Admiral Island. Saltspring was the official name as recorded by the Geographic Board of Canada in 1905.  However, Canada Post and many locals used (and still use) the name Salt Spring (2 words) Island . It is frequently abbreviated as SSI.\n\nSalt Spring Island was first settled in 1859, primarily by farmers.  In the early years it was settled by many different groups including a number of African-Americans and then a number of Hawaiians and settled on Salt Spring and a number of other gulf islands.  In the 1960s and 1970s there was a large influx of ",{"type":"''","value":["back to the landers"]}," who lived either in informal communes or squatted.  Many of these people have settled\nand have become a large part of the culture of Salt Spring.  Since the 1970s Salt Spring has attracted a large number of artists, and has become more and more of a tourist destination and retirement spot for the wealthy.  This dichotomy of large developments for the hordes of people who want to get away from the development of the city has created a certain amount of conflict.  However the island is still primarily characterized by the artists and farmers.\n\nThe main town, in the centre of the island, is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ganges"]},".
