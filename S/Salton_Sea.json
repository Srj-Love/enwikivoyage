It is about 227 feet below sea level.  Its salinity level is 44 parts per thousand versus 35 parts per thousand for the Pacific Ocean.  The sea's salinity level has been rising, putting the ecosystem at serious long-term risk.\n\nIt is a popular destination for boating and fishing.  It is in the south-eastern corner of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["California"]]},", about 100 miles east of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Diego"]]},", 70 miles southeast of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Palm Springs"]]},", 30 miles north of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mexicali"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brawley"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mecca (California)"],["Mecca"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Niland"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Salton City"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nUntil 1905 the area was known as the Salton Basin.  In that year, an irrigation canal from the Colorado river broke, sending water flooding into the basin.  This flooding lasted a year and a half, and when it was done, the Salton Basin had become the Salton Sea.  In reality, the basin has been flooded countless times throughout its long history, and periodically dries out because it is in a desert that gets 3 inches of rain each year.\n\nIn the past the Salton Sea was a resort area, but changing water levels and the increasing salinity of the water resulted in decreased tourism and the collapse of the resort industry.  The majority of the business in the Salton Sea area is now agricultural.\n\nBecause of its southern latitude, elevation of 227 feet below sea level, and location in the Sonoran Desert, the area sees some of the hottest temperatures in the nation with daily temperatures from May to October often exceeding 100°F, and extreme temperatures higher than 115°F recorded yearly.\n\nThe Salton Sea's water is supplied almost entirely by agricultural runoff from irrigation water drawn from the Colorado River.  Upcoming changes to water allocation will drastically reduce the amount of water entering the sea, leaving its future uncertain.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nTwo highways, California State Routes 86 and 111, run the length of the Salton Sea and cross each other in both Mecca and Brawley.  CA 86 is a major four-lane route on the west side of the sea and is heavily traveled.  CA 111 is a two-lane highway on the east side of the sea that, while paved, tends to be in poorer condition than CA 86.\n\nThe posted speed limit lowers on CA 111 when crossing from Imperial County into Riverside County.  Watch your speed, because the Riverside County Sheriff actively enforces the speed limit in that area.\n\nThere are two US Border Patrol checkpoints for northbound traffic on CA 86 at the junction of CA 78 and on CA 111 about 11 miles north of Niland.  It usually takes only a few minutes to pass the checkpoints.  Weekends and holidays will bring more traffic and longer wait times, but it's rarely unreasonable.  Do not try to evade these checkpoints.\n\nAll around the sea there are local roads, some paved and some not, that provide access to areas such as the sea shore, abandoned residential and commercial developments, and conservation areas.  Be careful driving on unpaved roads.  In dry weather they can be heavily rutted.  In wet weather, they are glue.  The clay surfaces turn into thick, sticky mud given the least rainfall.  If you don't get stuck outright trying to travel one of these roads after a recent rain, your car will at the very least be covered in mud.\n\nCalifornia State Route 78 skirts the south end of the Salton Sea and connects Anza-Borrego State Park in the west to the Imperial Sand Dunes in the east by way of Brawley.\n\nRailroad tracks run along the eastern side of the sea carrying mostly Union Pacific freight trains.  While Amtrak trains also use this line, there are no local stops in any of the communities on the Salton Sea.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Salton sea algal bacterial bloom.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["The smell of rotting fish and occasional algal blooms are evidence of the environmental degradation of the sea."]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mud volcanoes"]}," - Located near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Niland"]]}," at the instersection of Wister Road and West Schrimpf Road.

All that remains of that camp are the concrete foundations (slabs) of the original buildings.  In the years since Camp Dunlap was closed, it has been taken over by permanent and itinerant residents living in motorhomes and camping trailers.  It has become an ad-hoc community with a library, church, and even occasional, small concerts.  Personal safety in Slab City is often viewed skeptically, though whatever crime does occur there does not seem to scare off its residents.  There is no law enforcement in Slab City except for the Imperial County Sheriff.

The Sonny Bono Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge also maintains ponds as well as agricultural fields for the same purpose.  The Imperial Valley, extending from the southeast end of the Salton Sea all the way to the Mexican border, is full of agricultural fields that attract large numbers of migratory birds including snow geese, sandhill cranes, and a large variety of ducks.  Many of the birds around the sea are nesting in protected areas, so be cautious of where you go."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Boating"]}," - Boating is rare on the Salton Sea, but it is possible.
