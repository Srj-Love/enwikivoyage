The legacy remains today in its large black population, and the resulting culture in many ways outshines the rest of Brazil; in music, many of the greatest names from the mid-20th century to the present hail from Salvador, such as Dorival Caymmi, Gilberto Gil, and Caetano Veloso. In literature, the late Jorge Amado was also from the region. It's a vibrant, exciting city, and its people are quite friendly.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Orientation"]},"\nSalvador is on a peninsula on the north-east coast of Brazil which shields the large ",{"type":"''","value":["Baía de Todos os Santos"]}," (\"All Saints Bay\") from the Atlantic Ocean. The city is the third largest in Brazil, sprawling for dozens of kilometres inland from the coast. Most visitors head for the coastal neighbourhoods that cluster around where the bay meets the ocean.Salvador, Brazil has a tropical climate including rainforests and lush vegetation.\n\nA 100m cliff runs along the entire bayshore, dividing the city into ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cidade Alta"]},", up on the cliff, and the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cidade Baixa"]}," down by the bay.

The latter features a commercial center with lots of bus traffic coming in from all over Salvador.\n\nOutside of this area, there are many beach districts that stretch from the tip of the peninsula northeast along the Atlantic coast. The ",{"type":"'''","value":["Barra"]}," neighborhood at the tip of the peninsula is the main alternative jumping-off point to Pelourinho, and a little further to the northeast are the hip neighborhoods of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Rio Vermelho"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Amaralina"]},", which feature a nightlife less geared to the foreign tourism industry. A decent bus ride beyond these is the neighborhood of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Itapuã"]},", which has an energetic beach side nightlife and relatively few foreign visitors. Northward from there are kilometres and kilometers of gorgeous beaches, all accessible by bus.\n\nThe bayshore coast north beyond Pelourinho features a more tranquil atmosphere and a locally patronized, though less scenic, beach life. The interior of Salvador is where the \"new city\" has developed, full of residential neighborhoods, shopping megaplexes, and knotted highways, all of which can be quite alienating without actually having a friend to show you around.\n\nLocal residents enjoy sharing their exotic dancing and music skills with tourists.

Salvador recognizes the importance of tourism to the city economy, so most important tourist sites such as Pelourinho and Mercado Modelo, as well as main popular festivals like the Carnaval, are usually heavily guarded.\n\nPeople with darker complexions will have an advantage over those with pale skin. Blacks are likely to blend in well; other dark-skinned people may be inconspicuous in many places, but others are immediately labelled as either upper class citizens or tourists, and may be specially targeted.\n\nIf you are moving on foot, by bicycle, or by bus, it's best to go out during the day. Avoid bringing anything valuable, just enough to enjoy your day. The Flamengo and Stella Maris beaches are among the safest places to go during the day, and they are the best options if you just want to enjoy a good beach without much local culture. In other places, try to stay at areas guarded by police.\n\nAs a general rule, be suspicious if people approach you directly in a friendly way as they either want money or to sell you something.\n\nAt night, it's better to take a cab to go out. Stay at reasonably crowded places. If you don't see other tourists where you are, then it's probably not a place you should be unless you are feeling particularly adventurous.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Some areas which are strongly frequented by foreigners can become dangerous, especially at night, i.e. the Barra harbour area.

Always ask for a Coupon Fiscal it ensures that the company or individual you are purchasing from pays the proper tax, and it can usually result in them \"suddenly\" giving you a 10 - 15% discount if you don't want the Coupon as they have to pay 27% tax what you buy and the Coupon ensures this.\n\nBe particularly aware of Banca and Kiosks on the street as they will undoubtedly charge you more for being an estrangeiro (foreigner).\n\nAll the little extra money you are charged can seriously eat into your budget and leave a sour taste in your mouth as nobody likes being ripped off.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nFor a nice day trip, catch the ferry to the laid-back island of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Itaparica"]]},".\nSalvador is also the gateway to many other nearby attractions such as:\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Praia do Forte"]]},".
