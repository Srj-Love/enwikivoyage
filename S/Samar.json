Travelers to the province of Samar may ride bus from Metro Manila at the Ali Mall Bus Terminal in Cubao and from the various Pasay City terminals that sprout along EDSA.\nOnce the bus has reached the southern tip of Luzon island, you will take a 30-minute ferryboat to the northern end of Samar, after which you can continue your bus trip, or transfer to a myriad of jeepneys, smaller buses, and tricycles to take you to anywhere in Samar.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nLocal mini buses ply from Catbalogan City to Tacloban City in Leyte and vice-versa and from Catbalogan to Calbayog and Catarman, Northern Samar and vice-versa. The schedule of inter-provincial run of local mini buses is irregular since it is dependent on the volume passengers and the pace of passengers loading into the buses.\n\nOn top of these buses, there are a number of passenger vans that ply Catbalogan and Calbayog route almost every half an hour. The vans also run the Catbalogan-Tacloban route almost every quarter of an hour and Calbayog-Allen-Catarman route almost every hour.\n\nThe last schedule of run of both inter-provincial mini buses and vans is up to late in the afternoon due to distance. There are few vans that ply in the evening. However, buses from Manila or Mindanao pass through the Maharlika Highway on a 24 hour basis. However, stops are only made either in Catbalogan City or Calbayog City.\n\nFrom the two urban centers of Catbalogan City and Calbayog City, there are jeepneys that ply from the two localities going to the various towns of Samar.\n\nThe van from Catarman to Calbayog takes 2 hours and costs p100.
