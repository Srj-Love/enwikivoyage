However, settlement there had been mentioned since at least the 14th century. During World War II, Samara, then named Kuibyshev, was the second capital of USSR. The city's growth was stimulated during the war due to its proximity to Moscow but distance from the war zone; several government offices were evacuated to Kuibyshev when Moscow was under threat. The post-war development of the Volga-Urals oilfield also helped. Kuibyshev reverted to being Samara in 1991.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh =   -7.8"],["febhigh =   -6.8"],["marhigh =   -0.4"],["aprhigh =   11.8"],["mayhigh =   20.7"],["junhigh =   24.9"],["julhigh =   26.2"],["aughigh =   24.1"],["sephigh =   17.8"],["octhigh =   8.7"],["novhigh =   -0.6"],["dechigh =   -5.4"],["janlow =   -14.2"],["feblow =   -13.6"],["marlow =   -7.4"],["aprlow =   2.8"],["maylow =   9.7"],["junlow =   14.6"],["jullow =   16.3"],["auglow =   14.1"],["seplow =   8.9"],["octlow =   2.2"],["novlow =   -5"],["declow =   -10.9"],["janprecip =  46"],["febprecip =  35"],["marprecip =  33"],["aprprecip =  39"],["mayprecip =  32"],["junprecip =  58"],["julprecip =  64"],["augprecip =  52"],["sepprecip =  45"],["octprecip =  52"],["novprecip =  54"],["decprecip =  51"],["description = Average of Samara"]]},"\n\nAs a cultural centre, Samara has attracted several famous creative Russians.
