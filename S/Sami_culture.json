Although you will meet authentic Sámi in the towns, find museums, shops and exhibitions there and may have the chance to participate in Sámi festivals, an understanding of the Sámi necessarily includes a feeling for the wast areas outside cities.

Even traditionally, though, not all Sámi have been involved in big scale reindeer husbandry, but lived from fishing, hunting and similar. Today many Sámi work in modern trades. Tourism in an important income in the Sápmi area.\n\nAs reindeer herders or hunters the Sámi traditionally followed the animals on their seasonal migrations, having a winter village, a summer village and mobile homes (goahtis and lávvus). The reindeer still have seasonal pastures (mostly treeless areas in summer), but the borders between countries, closed after failed negotiations in the 19th century, restricted the migration. With the introduction of motorized vehicles, reindeer herders have been able to reach their livestock from a permanent home, but many of the people you will meet were born before this revolution.\n\nMany tourists in Sápmi want to experience the exotic Sámi culture. This has lead to non-Sámi dressing in quasi-Sámi clothes and performing \"Sámi\" rituals. You may enjoy these shows for what they are, but if you want to learn about Sámi culture, you should be wary of the difference.
