Then, during the transition from the Ayutthaya to the Thon Buri periods, it was separated from Ratchaburi and named \"Mueang Mae Klong\". Samut Songkhram was historically important during the establishment of Thon Buri as the kingdom’s capital by King Taksin the Great. When the Burmese led an army to Tambon Bang Kung, the king gathered the people to build a fort and prevent the city from the Burmese troops. This was an important act against the Burmese invaders at that time.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By car "]},"\nTake Hwy 35 (Thonburi–Pak Tho or Rama II Rd), past the Na Kluea–Maha Chai intersection.
