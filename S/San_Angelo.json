The founder, Bartholomew DeWitt, named it \"Santa Angela\" after his wife, Carolina Angela.  This was eventually shortened to \"San Angela.\"  The final change came in 1883 when the US Postal Service informed the town that the name was grammatically incorrect (",{"type":"''","value":["san"]}," can only be used before a male name).
