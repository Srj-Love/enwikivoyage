Hispanics make up a considerable fraction of the population though and it shows in most places. The Hispanic atmosphere of San Antonio makes it a truly unique U.S. city. This becomes most evident during Fiesta week, a yearly celebration that attracts 3.5 million people to its 110 plus events from all over to enjoy parades, music, festivals, fairs and food and drink in the charming downtown streets of the city.\n\nSan Antonio, with a population of around 1.4 million, and a metro population of nearly 2.2 million, still enjoys a small-town feel despite the hustle and bustle. Its people are friendly, open and bicultural, and the concentration of population around its center makes it easy to get just about anywhere within a 30-40 minute drive.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Imperial"],["janhigh = 62"],["febhigh = 66"],["marhigh = 74"],["aprhigh = 80"],["mayhigh = 86"],["junhigh = 92"],["julhigh = 95"],["aughigh = 95"],["sephigh = 90"],["octhigh = 82"],["novhigh = 71"],["dechigh = 64"],["janlow = 39"],["feblow = 43"],["marlow = 50"],["aprlow = 58"],["maylow = 66"],["junlow = 72"],["jullow = 74"],["auglow = 74"],["seplow = 69"],["octlow = 59"],["novlow = 48"],["declow = 42"],["janprecip = 1.7"],["febprecip = 1.9"],["marprecip = 1.6"],["aprprecip = 2.6"],["mayprecip = 4.2"],["junprecip = 3.6"],["julprecip = 1.9"],["augprecip = 2.5"],["sepprecip = 3.2"],["octprecip = 3.2"],["novprecip = 2.1"],["decprecip = 1.7"],["description = ",{"type":"{{","value":[["ForecastNOAA"],["San Antonio"],["29.4245"],["-98.49466"]]}]]},"\n\nDuring the summer it can get hot, and sometimes humid.

The Express routes usually run from the sub-urban areas (mostly Park and Rides) to downtown.Most of them run about once every 30 minutes.
