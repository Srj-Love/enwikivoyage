The 2000 census shows the population to be 185,401. Of this, 45.2% are white and 16.4% are African-American.  27.1% is cited as \"some other race\", the majority of which is most likely Hispanic. The city, along with its outlying areas, has a large Hispanic and Spanish-speaking population. 40.4% of the population speaks a language other than English at home.\n\nRecent years have not been kind to San Bernardino.  The closure of the Kaiser Steel facility in nearby Fontana in the 1980s and the closure of Norton Air Force Base in 1994 were cataclysmic to the economy of the city.  Repeated attempts at downtown revitalization have been mostly unsuccessful.  In 2012 the city declared bankruptcy in the wake of a stubborn economic decline.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]}," \nSan Bernardino can be accessed by several Southern California airports. Ontario International Airport (airport code: ONT) is the best option, being located approximately 15 miles southwest of San Bernardino. For those willing to rent a car, west of the city is Burbank Airport (now known as Bob Hope Airport; airport code: BUR) and lying to the southwest, Long Beach Airport (airport code: LGB). Each of these airports are approximately 67 miles away. Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) is about 80 miles southwest. These airports are serviced by most major airlines such as Delta, American, United, Southwest, Alaska Air, and US Airways. LAX typically has more frequent service and more affordable flights than those to the other airports; but the convenience of Ontario Airport can make it an asset.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.amtrak.com\/ Amtrak"]}]}," serves San Bernardino with a station at 1170 W.
