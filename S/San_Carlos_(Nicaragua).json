A taxi is C$10 all around town (double rates at night). A local bus exists but is not useful for tourists.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThere are really only two sights in San Carlos - the malecon, and the fort just above the central park. The malecon can be seen in about 10 minutes. The fort is interesting for those who read Spanish. If you don't, it's really only notable for its limited views of the lake and river.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nWatch a baseball game. The stadium is close to the airport and although the local team has traditionally been abysmal and gets a pounding from pretty much the rest of the league, it's a cheap fun way to get in contact with the locals. Any taxi driver can get you there (it is quite some distance to walk).\n\nYou could theoretically swim in the lake at the ",{"type":"''","value":["malecon"]},". The locals do. However, as a lot of untreated sewage used to be running into the lake until quite recently, use your own best judgement.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nAs of February, 2014, there are numerous ATMs and at least one bank around town.\nSan Carlos does not have a Supermarket (yet, there are constant talks of building one but when is anybody's guess) but you can fulfill most of your daily needs at small ventas (also known as pulperias) all aroung town. The mercado has a decent selction of resh fruits, vegetables clothes and toiletries. Prices are slightly higher than in Managua and some prices (e.g. those of plantains) undergo a weekly cycle with the transports from Ometepe. As the rest of the Rio San Juan deprtamento is even less accessible many travelers stock up on essentials before moving on.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nAround the Malecon there are several little Sodas where you can get decent food from 7 am in the morning. La Fortaleza, the last of the sodas on the raised platform right in front of the Malecon's central square, comes highly recommended with very friendly staff and excellent prices. Quick service and super close to the pier if you have limited time. They are happy to accommodate vegetarians.\n\nAt 11 am the more fancy restaurants open but don't expect to much. Fish is the thing to eat in San Carlos (if you are not vegetarian).\n\nAbove La Fortaleza, with an entrance on the nearest sidestreet, is Restaurant Kaoma. Nicely decorated with a great view of the water, this is the place to sit and spend an evening with a few drinks. The menu is in English and Spanish, but expect to pay C$150-300 for an entree.\n\nAttached to Hotel Cabinas Leyko is Restaurant Don Leo. They also have a Spanish&English menu, but more reasonably priced than Kaoma (though without the atmosphere) and with excellent WiFi.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nSan Carlos has two places where the young locals go to party drink and dance. both close to the ",{"type":"''","value":["malecon"]},"\nEl Kaoma has an air conditioned (read: freezingly cold) disco downstairs that really gets going on Karaoke nights. Lots of fun to be had, just don't expect to know the songs.\nLa Champa is a place where you can go to dance. It is usually packed on Saturday nights but half empty on Friday evenings. It closes at 2AM but you can take out a beer.\nAs San Carlos is a port town some of the bars can have a bit of an unsavory feeling to them. the two discos mentioned above are save however.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nThere are several budget ",{"type":"''","value":["Hospedajes"]}," all around the Malecon and in the streets leading up the hill, but San Carlos is only a place to stay if you arrive late at night with no forward-transit options.\n\nSome travel guides recommend Hotel Costa Sur, but you'd do well to avoid. It may have once been nice, but in February, 2014 the surly staff kept an unclean building (dead bat in the hallway, dirty floors), the bathrooms smelled like raw sewage, the water did not work for most of two days (this was *not* a city-wide issue), and the ventilation was little to none. On the plus side, they provide free drinking water and condoms.\n\nHotel Cabinas Leyko is a nice option with parking, friendly staff, and free water - though not particularly cheap by Nicaraguan standards. Clean rooms with complimentary soap and shampoo, in February 2014 a double room without bath was $20USD, while a triple room with attached bath was $36USD (or $13\/pp). Both included breakfast at their restaurant next door. They can also arrange tours throughout the area.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\nCybers abound in San Carlos Internet is C$10 per half hour and usually charged after you leave.\nThe quality is pretty much the same everywhere but MniCyber Ortega is right at the Malecon with beautiful lake-views and there are also headsets which might or might not be working and the owner has a side business repairing computers.\nLocals generally say that Claro has better service in San Carlos but Movistar is better for the surrounding countryside.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Every Tuesday and Friday the boat to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ometepe"],["Isla Ometepe"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Granada (Nicaragua)"],["Granada"]]}," leaves at 2 pm."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" There are two boats leaving for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Los Chiles"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Costa Rica"]]},".
