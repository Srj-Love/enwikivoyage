It is built on hills including the most famous in Trinidad ---San Fernando Hill. San Fernando is very much a carnival city, experiencing a full build-up to its own wide assortment of competitions in Skinner Park as well as energetic parades.\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nAn easy connection from Port of Spain, Chaguanas and other Northern and central towns can be made via the Uriah Butlerâ€“Solomon Hochoy Highway.\n\nFrom the southwest, connections can be made via the S.S. Erin Road or the Southern Main Road and Mosquito Creek.  \n\nFrom the southeast, connections can be made via the Naparima-Mayaro Road to the Mon Repos roundabout.\n\nGetting to San Fernando can also be done by boat.

High street, the main shopping street in the second city, has a range of chain stores and one-off stores run by local businessmen. The largest mall in the Southland is the Gulf City Shopping Complex, tucked away in the suburban Gulf View area, accessible via the San Fernando By Pass route.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nLots of restaurants around. Like Soong's Great Wall Restaurant, Jenny's Wok and Golden Dragon just to name a few of the better ones.\n\nYou must try their \"black pudding\". A Friday delicacy consisting of seasoned pig's blood stuffed in intestines and pre-cooked before its fried in front of you. It may sound disgusting to many cultures but you should really try it before you knock it. It is absolutely delicious.\n\nAnother great restaurant in south Trinidad is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Canton Palace"]}," which is located at Cross Crossing. They serve traditional Chinese and Cantonese style dishes. If pork is one of the meats you eat, I recommend trying their Char Sue Pork and their Roasted Pork. I personally recommend you have Michael, one of the chefs, prepare your meals.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n\"Sting\" and \"The Edge\" night clubs are  popular clubs for those who want to dance to a variety of music all night long. \"Horace's\", \"Richie's\" and the \"Uncle Sam's\" are cozier night spots for those who prefer a smaller crowd. Don't forget about Tree House or TGIF.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Trinidad"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago"]]},{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["10.283333333333"],["-61.466666666667"]]}]
