In 1797, the pueblo was moved to the Plaza Pueblo (now Plaza de César Chávez), around which San José grew.  And the rest is, as they say, history.\n\nTrue to its location in the heart of Silicon Valley, San José is now home to the headquarters of many \"tech\" companies such as Cisco Systems, eBay, and Adobe Systems, just to name a few.\n\nThere are so many different neighborhoods in the large geographic area of San José that, depending on where you are, you might not know if you're still in the same city.  Like most Bay Area towns and cities, San José is an expensive place to live (many basic houses easily top $1M in price). Some of the hip areas to live these days are in San Jose's downtown area, for those who prefer urban living, or Santana Row for a mixed living, shopping and dining community. You can find vintage California charm in the neighborhoods of Willow Glen and Rose Garden. The woodsy area of Almaden Valley is known for its excellent schools, and Silver Creek is known for its subdivisions of sprawling \"McMansions.\"\nEvergreen is in East San Jose, right at the foothills of the city. Evergreen has some more affordable housing and is very residential. Since it is at the foothills, east San Jose is not as accessible as the other neighborhoods. Evergreen has excellent views of the foothills and many parks and recreational areas. Groseprick Park is located right in the heart of Evergreen and offers a mile long loop, basketball courts, baseball fields, playgrounds, and hiking trails.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nPeople who ask, \"Do you know the way to San José?\" (in reference to the 1968 hit song recorded by Dionne Warwick) will be ",{"type":"''","value":["glared at"]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nSan José is home to one of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bay Area (California)"],["Bay Area's"]]}," three international airports.

See the top of these hills by driving into East San Jose. The houses on the hills are spread out and ranch from ranches, farms, and even mansions. These houses can be seen from the valley and the picturesque drive leads to the top of the hills where you can see the entire landscape of San Jose.
