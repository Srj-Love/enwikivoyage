tough neighborhoods at its borders with larger cities. One area to be aware of is the portion of MacArthur Boulevard near the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oakland"]]}," border. This area is next to the notorious and impoverished \"deep\" East Oakland, which has some of the Bay Area's highest drug trafficking and murder rates. The area between the Hayward and Ashland borders (just south of the Bayfair Center)  is reasonably safe during the day, but gets sketchy after dark. Nevertheless, San Leandro is a safe city with designated crime free zones, including the area near the Castro Valley border at Lake Chabot to the end of Estudillo Avenue (where downtown begins), near the marina, and a large portion of the Washington Manor neighborhood (including the Washington Manor Park and Pool) from Interstate 880 to Farnsworth Avenue. Due to the presence of a juvenile hall, Fairmont Drive in the city's eastern hills is heavily secured between Lake Chabot Park and 152nd Avenue. Police patrols are very frequent and security cameras are hidden on trees and fences.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay Healthy"]},"\n\nAs with almost every city in the United States, San Leandro has at least one hospital. The San Leandro Hospital is a health care facility treating the most basic of health needs such as the flu to various surgeries and basic emergencies.
