The small, laid back town is the main access point to the stunningly beautiful ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Piedra Blanca"]]}," region.  San Luis is one of many rural agricultural communities in the area, cultivating crops such as plantains, oranges, sugarcane, coffee and cacao (chocolate) in the fertile soil and sub-tropical climate.  The area was once all virgin rainforest, which was partly destroyed by the original settlers, around 50 years ago.  The remaining forest is threatened by logging, though environmental awareness is gradually increasing and new ecotourism projects are trying to create alternative sources of income and conserve the forests.\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nBy bus, travel to Zapotal (between Quevedo and Babahoyo, on the main route from Quito or Santo Domingo to Guayaquil). This takes around 5-6 hours from Quito, or about 3 hours from Guayaquil. From Quito take any bus heading towards Guayaquil, from Guayaquil take any bus heading towards Quito and get off at Zapotal.  Zapotal is just a small collection of restaurants and shops on the main road - get off here and wait at the T-junction for the local buses to San Luis de Pambil (the journey takes just over one hour, buses depart every hour and the last bus departs around 6pm).
