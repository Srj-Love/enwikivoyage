Most bars, restaurants, and attractions are centered around services to a college crowd.  There is also a considerable conservationist mindset associated with the local rivers and endangered species.  Several species live only in the headwaters of the San Marcos river.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nSan Marcos is located along interstate 35 (I-35) in between Austin and San Antonio.  \n\nFrom Austin, take I-35 South about 23 miles.  You can take exits 206-204 to access the town.  The university is on the West (right) side of I-35 coming from the direction of Austin.\n\nFrom San Antonio, take I-35 North approximately 46 miles.  You may take exits 204 thru 206 to access the town.  Texas State University and the town square are on the West (left) side of the freeway coming from San Antonio.\n\nNotably, San Marcos is a popular shopping destination, as it hosts large outlet malls South of the town about 5 miles, in the direction of San Antonio.  You cannot miss them from I-35 (on the East side of the freeway).\n\nTo get to San Marcos from Houston, take IH-10 west to Luling (exit 632, about two hours), turn right (on to SH-80) and go through Luling.  Continue on SH-80 north (the designated highway turns left, just after the railroad tracks).  Beware of the speed traps in Martindale, just before San Marcos.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By Car"]},"\nTravel in most American cities, especially outside of major metro areas, is primarily by private vehicle.  Parking is almost always abundant and free.  (There are a few lots close to the city square where the owners tow aggressively; be sure to watch for parking signs.) The average tourist would be well-advised to rent a car from a rental agency if they don't already have their own vehicle.  Traffic is usually light.  \n\nTake caution at some low water bridges.
