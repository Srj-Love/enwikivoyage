The town has become a resort for all things spiritual, with several ",{"type":"[[","value":[["meditation"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["yoga"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["massage"]]}," centers.

I recommend flying into Guatemala City (known by the locals as 'Guate') then proceed to drive 3.5 hours. The major highways that are in route are mostly updated. When exiting, take caution to the windy, dirt road that leads to the small town of San Marcos. \n\nThere is also a shuttle from San Christobal, Mexico. The shuttle provides a traveler with a rich cultural experience by traveling in what the locals refer to as a \"chicken bus\". The \"chicken bus\" will drop you off in Panajachel and from there you can take a luancha (small boat) to San Marcos. \n\nIf traveling from Antigua, a popular tourist destination in Guatemala, the only means of transportation is a six hour car ride between towns. There are buses leaving from backpacker hostels. It costs about Q50\/Q70 depending on the time you want to leave.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nThe most striking feature of this town is that it has practically no roads — everything is reached by thin foot paths through trees and between buildings.  Handmade signs direct you to the most common destinations at any intersection.\n\nThe homemade paths have a very intimate feel to them. They are shaped by the plants and flowers that create almost fences that guide you in the correct path. \n\nThere are minimal streetlights and not many signs so I would recommend paying attention to where you are going and don't be scared to ask the locals if you are lost! Many of the roads are narrow and curvy so I suggest your full attention to where you are going!\n\nMost of the modern infrastructure resides in San Pedro where streets are paved and there are more signs dedicated to the comprehension of lost tourists.\n\nMajority of the travel within the area around Lake Atitlan is by boat. There are fifteen 'major' pueblos or small towns surrounding the lake, San Marcos included. From San Marcos, there are boats leaving every twenty to thirty minutes to each of these individual towns. Some of the known rates are as fallows; from San Marcos to San Pedro it costs 10Q (US$1.25), from San Marcos to Panajachel it costs between 20\/25 Q (US$2.50-3.50).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nThe lake provides both natural entertainment and also great scenic views. If you are adventurous, I definitely recommend climbing some of the dormant volcanoes. At some of the highest peaks you are able to see the lake and all of the small pueblos that surround it. From the top looking down there is one of the most beautiful views in Guatemala.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Facilities"]},"\n\nSan Marcos offers a wide variety of studios catered to the pure relaxation of the tourist. Many of the studios include yoga, reiki and massage. Many yogis often travel to San Marcos to practice their yoga at the highest level of peace and harmony. El Centro de Meditacion Las Piramides is an example of a yoga\/massage\/mediation 'camp', where the main focus is to get in-touch with your spiritual self and live in harmony.\n\nFor those work-out-aholics, there is a local gym that accepts a monthly membership for 150Q or $22 American dollars per month.\n\nSan Marcos also houses one of the most harmonious massage clinics in all of Guatemala. It is located right next to the lake, so that massage clients can hear the sound of the water to make their experience more relaxing. The San Marcos Holistic Center is one of the most popular massage clinics in the area.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Rock Jumping"]}," - There are a series of rocks that can be accessed by foot via the shore of the lake.

There are enough yoga retreats and spiritual centers to fulfill anyones spiritual needs. San Marcos is the perfect location for pure bliss and relaxation. Majority of the activities are based around relaxation and connection with your spiritual self.  It has a very laid back feel and culture with no obvious worries. It has been described as a place that \"takes life as it comes\".\n\nThere is still a very strong and authentic Mayan culture in existence within the town of San Marcos. Their culture is best known for its bright colors in its clothing, artwork and food. \n\nSan Marcos is also great for outdoor adventure. Because of the lake there is a very rich ecological reservation of many endangered species. The lake also provides direct pleasure with swimming, sailing, kayaking, and even cliff jumping. The most popular cliff jumping site is a ten minute walk from the center of San Marcos. If you are an adventurous type, there is a lot of hiking up and down volcanos, enjoying beautiful scenery of the lake from a high point and also great bird watching. Scuba is also available if you are feeling adventuresome. \n\nThis is a great place for some who is interested in cooking tourism. A new emerging type of tourism that focusing on chefs or food lovers traveling around to find the freshest produce and cooking up delicious feasts with the use of only local items. San Marcos and the surrounding towns have many open air markets or mercados that provide fresh fruits and vegetables of all kind to the locals and tourists. The best market that I visited was the Microdyn, it had the freshest produce for the best price.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\nThere is a sustained Mayan culture in the town of San Marcos.

The open air markets provide great, fresh produce for very cheap so if your interested you are able to find an array of ingredients to cook a home cooked meal. \n\nMoonfish Cafe has the best fresh fruit pancakes I have ever eaten in my life. Not to mention they were huge and delicious and only cost us 10 Q!\n\nThe street food is also very delicious and I never seemed to have a problem with my stomach after eating it. The locals take full advantage of the local produce so majority of the offered dishes are vegetarian and all are fresh!\n\nAllula is a Japanese sushi bar.

These hotel packages may include yoga sessions, meditation hours, and even massage and spa services. \n\nThe \"Unicornio\" hotel is a mere three minute walk from the beach. It has a very cozy feel but is also one of the most luxurious hotels that San Marcos has to offer.\n\nHostels are also another option for stay in San Marcos. The hostels have been described as 'original and cozy'. \n\nPasaj Cap is also another option for board while staying in San Marcos. I would recommend this option for those travelers traveling in a group of maybe three or more. Pasaj Cap offers travelers to rent out actual houses right outside of San Marcos. The houses are very beautiful and private. From what I have read on blogs, the window are described as 'open' where the \"scenery is in your room\". From these private homes, it is a twenty minute walk to San Marcos. On the way there the walk is down hill but on the way home it is uphill. I recommend wearing sneakers so that you don't slip on the rugged terrain.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["14.7167"],["-91.2667"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Lake Atitlán"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:San Marcos La Laguna"]]}]
