A fun night can be had in Zona Viva going from bar to bar. A local favorite and fun place to hang out is La Cava in Barrio Los Andes 2 and 3 Calle, 16 Ave NO. Great Karaoke nights and occasional live music on the weekends packs the people in. Jerry the owner mixes a range or cocktails. Watch out for the Barcardi 121 or ask if he has some Guaro for a fire packed drink. There is a good selection of music and the patrons are always happy to have a chat.\n\nKaraoke Club in Zona Viva is a popular place with the locals and even if you are not a Karaoke fan it can be a good place to catch some quality music. The quality of the singers is at times surprising and at other times not so surprising. Big Daddies, Caribbean and Gators Sports Bar are also all popular spots in Zona Viva. Bars do come and go regularly in San Pedro Sula, so just look for a place with some people and some music.\n\nTGI Fridays, Applebee's, Ruby Tuesdays and Fogancito's are all popular places to eat and drink on the weekends. All places are well located near the Circunvalcion. \n\nFor a bit more local color and atmosphere, consider visiting a local disco. Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights are the most popular. But most discos are open every night except Monday. Check the local papers for promotion nights such as ladies night, live music, beer promotions or open bar (cover charge, then all you care to drink).\n\nThe pick of the discos is Kawamas Bay, which is located on the Circunvalcion. The disco plays a lot of Latin music and has a friendly staff. It can get very busy on the weekends usually around 11.00 PM. The disco stays open to 5 AM or 6 PM and it is a place to dance. You will find more people on the dance floor than at the bar or tables and chairs for most of the night. So put on your dancing shoes and be ready for some Salsa, Merengue and Punta. No need to worry, since you will still get a bit of house, rock and techno music. Cover charges vary from $2.50 to $6, depending on the night.\n\nMillenium Disco is located in the Social Club Arabe at the end of Barrio Rio Pierdas the disco is the classiest place in town. Friday and Saturday nights are busy and cover charges vary from $3.50 to $6.\n\nThe Sampedrano Cultural Center holds regularly events such as concerts, performances and art shows. Call (504) 553-3911 or 553-3768 for event schedules.\n\nFor safety reasons, be sure to take a taxi when traveling even just a few blocks after dark. Walking around Zona Viva is OK but only within a block or two radius of the area. Otherwise just get a taxi, most fares cost $2 to $3, but prices do go up the later the night gets.\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["drink"],["name=Atucun Bar\/Pub"],["url=http:\/\/www.atucun.com"],["email="],["address=3 calle entre 18 y 19 avenida"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=1 block from burger king main"],["phone=98224985"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=8:30 pm to 2:00 am"],["price=$1.50 beer"],["content=Open from wednesday to saturday ! drink specials with honduran traditional liquors !
