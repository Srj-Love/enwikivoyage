[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Juriques+licancabour.JPG"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["San Pedro de Atacama"]}," is a town in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Northern Chile"]]},". It's a very popular destination among Chilean tourists and international visitors alike. Visitors come in large numbers, to use the town as a stepping stone to the amazing landscapes around it. Most attractions are part of the Los Flamencos National Reserve, perhaps Chile's most varied and amazing national park. Prices in any of the laid back bars and restaurants fare well against Santiago's (Chile's Capital). Still, it's a fairly expensive location, as it's one of Chile's three most popular destinations, along Torres del Paine and Easter Island.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nBuses connect San Pedro with Salta and Jujuy in Argentina, as well as the rest of Chile. Several buses per day connect the town with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Calama, Antofagasta"],["Calama"]]},", operated by TurBus and other carriers (Frontera del Norte, Atacama 2000, and Intertrans). The trip takes about 1 hour and 20 minutes, costs 2.500 pesos (USD 5). Other buses from TurBus travel to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Antofagasta (city)"],["Antofagasta"]]}," (4 hours, $6000), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Iquique"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Arica"]]}," (12 hours, 22.000 pesos), and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Santiago de Chile"],["Santiago"]]},". There are also trips from Uyuni, in Bolivia, and Calama. Bus passes are available from the Green Toad Bus ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.greentoadbus.com\/en\/"]}," which allow you to travel to San Pedro from Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Bolivia and the rest of Chile.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nNo airlines fly direct to San Pedro. The nearest commercial airport is Calama. Three airlines serve Calama: LAN, Sky Airline and PAL. Most flights are direct, and connect Calama with Santiago, but a few also fly to Antofagasta and Iquique. A two-way ticket can be had for as little as USD 120, but it must bought at least a month beforehand, and these flights usually leave either very early in the morning, or quite late in the evening. From Calama to San Pedro is about 90 minutes by bus.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nAt the Calama airport you may rent a car. Car rentals are fairly expensive, however, for Calama is Chile's largest mining hub, and therefore rentals offer mostly medium pick-up trucks. You will need an international driving permit if you're not Argentinian or Chilean. Rentals are cheaper in Antofagasta, but the drive to San Pedro is long (about four hours). Most popular destinations are fairly easy to reach with a good map, but driving high in the Andes should not be undertaken by beginners in the area! The roads are often in terrible condition, not signaled at all, there's no cell phone signal, and acute mountain sickness is a real threat. Getting stuck in the less-traveled roads of the \"altiplano\" can be a death sentence, since some aren't used at all, and see perhaps a car every two months.\n\nAlways travel with a full tank, since the only gas station in the area is in San Pedro. You can find illegal fuel vendors in some of the smaller towns, like Toconao, but they charge outrageous prices. Also, remember that fuel consumption increases dramatically with rising altitude. Check the condition of all tires, even the spare; flat tires aren't at all unusual on the many dirt roads that lead to points of interest.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Hitchhiking"]},"\nChile is well-known as a hitchhikers paradise. Getting to Calama from any other point in the country is simple enough, but reaching San Pedro is a bit trickier. The best chances are to be had at the Topater monolith (\"Monolito de Topater\"). From there, walk south, beyond the underpass, and hitch a ride to town. You might have to wait for a while, but traffic to and from Calama is fairly consistent. Sometimes, even the vans of tourist agencies might pick you up-it all depends on your luck.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nOnce in the town, nearly all points of interest, restaurants, services, are within walking distance, with the exception of a few outlying hotels. Downtown comprises twelve small blocks, between the streets Domingo Atienza and Toconao from west to east, and Licancabur and Caracoles north to south. This last street is the main one, a pedestrian zone. Be aware that, since mid-2010, it's now forbidden to ride a bike in it. If you look ",{"type":"''","value":["gringo"]}," enough, chances are the cops will let you slide-but it's advised not to try. They're fond of ticketing cyclists in the evening.\nIf you can't find what you need in the aforementioned twelve blocks, chances are you won't get it anywhere.\nBike rentals are ubiquitous, and prices vary little. It can pay to rent one to visit the Pukara de Quitor, Aldea de Tulor, Valle de la Luna, and even Laguna Cejar. All of these are described in the next chapter.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThere are three essential places to visit, plus a host of other very interesting spots. In order of popularity, these are:\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Geysers del Tatio"]},"\nLocated at 4,200m above sea level, and a 100km away from town, these are some of the highest geysers in the world. It's also the third-largest geyser site on Earth, with over 80 active ones. Most agencies travel there at 4 AM. The spectacle is hard to forget-even if the geysers themselves are smallish, the backdrop, lighting, and sheer variety are astounding. Usually, you get to see them from the first stages of dawn, an hour before the sun rises, until sunlight bathes them completely. The best time to take pictures is at exact sunrise, but other lightings can also create wonderful pictures. ",{"type":"'''","value":["All"]}," respectable tour agencies include breakfast for their guests. If you book one that doesn't, then you've been scammed.\nOn the way back, it's typical to find wild vicuñas, an endangered Andean camelid that's highly protected in Chile. They were rescued from the verge of extinction thirty years ago. Vicuñas in the area are accustomed to human presence, and will tolerate tourists coming to some twenty meters away-any more, and they're likely to flee. Be extremely respectful of the regulations, for many guides and drivers might even react in an aggressive manner if you bother the animals in any way.\nA common stop is the fording of the Putana river, a spectacle that for some even surpasses the geysers themselves. Many different bird species inhabit it, and it's perfectly possible to get very close to them-giant coots (fulica gigantea) are especially indolent. Winter has the most birds, with over ten different species cohabiting the place at peak migration, but temperatures are ",{"type":"''","value":["harsh"]},". There's also the possibility of seeing a vizcacha or two (lagidium viscacia), a funny mix between a bunny, a squirrel, and a kangaroo. They're very shy, though, and if you don't get there among the first visitors, they'll have usually disappeared. In the background, to the east, lies the Putana volcano-an active mountain that boasts seven small fumes.\nLastly, there's usually the choice of visiting one of two locations. The first one is Machuca, an abandoned altiplanic village that lived from the mining of sulpher. Most regular tours stop here. Nowadays, you'll find a few locals there, roasting ",{"type":"''","value":["anticuchos"]}," made of llama meat. Teas, soft drinks and ",{"type":"''","value":["empanadas"]}," are also available. The meat is of questionable origins, with some wild theories as to its origin floating around. Ask your guide for a laugh. It's fairly safe to consume, though, as sanitation's decent. Just after exiting Machuca, it's common to see llamas grazing on a beautiful pasture. After that pasture lies a micro-sized salt pan, where vicuñas and James' flamingos can be seen (the latter only in summer, though).\nThe other location is Puritama.\nIf you plan on going, please consider the following things:\n",{"type":"*","value":["Temperatures can be terribly cold: -15ºC is common through June to August, while in summer it rarely dips below -5ºC. It's paramount to wear gloves, a cap, and preferably two layers of socks, along with a very warm jacket. After sunrise, the cold quickly subsides, and it gets bearable. Once you get to Machuca, the heat can be stifling. Prepare accordingly."]},{"type":"*","value":["The altitude, coupled to a steep and winding road, can easily cause height-sickness.

Do yourself a favor, and book an excursion."]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Valle de la Luna"]},"\nEntrance fee: $2000 Chilean Peso (the tours won't include it).\n\nCommonly advertised as 'Moon Valley' in english, this part of the Salt Mountain Range offers stunning clinal and anticlinal formations in a perfectly barren landscape. Almost all tours include watching the sunset there-you shouldn't miss it. The large stone walls resemble those of the Grand Canyon in Arizona, sans river. There are also huge halite (rock salt) strata that produce a knacking sound all day long. This can be unsettling at first, but it's actually harmless. Among its prime attractions are the Grand Crater, the Salt Canyon, the Three Maries and salt mines, the Salt Caves, the Cari Viewpoint (also called 'Piedra del Coyote'), and Valle de la Muerte (Death Valley). All tours visit a number of these, but it's virtually impossible to know which beforehand. Summer tours tend to be longer, though, and therefore have a greater probability of including more destinations.\n\nIt's perfectly possible to ride a bike there, but you should take your time. Although only 8km away from San Pedro, the road's steep and sinuous. When biking, it's advised to travel early (think 7-8 AM) in the morning, for afternoon temperatures can be suffocating year-round. You miss the sunset, but also lessen the possibility of heatstroke and the sightseeings won't be filled with tourists. Also, it's easier to find someone to rescue you if you get in trouble. Most drivers and guides are willing to help stranded cyclists, especially if they're female, or if you travel with one. Just don't expect them to carry a retinue of ten or so tired bikers! You should ",{"type":"'''","value":["get a flashlight"]}," especially if you want to watch sunset (the road can be dangerous when dark) but also because there's a cave you can visit and it's pitch black in there. Most bike rentals will lend you a headlight if you ask, but make sure the bike also has a tail reflector, and wear a helmet. Ask also an emergency kit for the bikes and a map of the valley.\nKilometro 0 has good bikes (Caracoles street). Prices: $3500 for 6 hours, $6000 for the whole day.\n\nIf you plan on going, please consider the following:\n",{"type":"*","value":["It can get cold immediately after sunset, especially in winter. Bring something warm to wear to enjoy the show to its fullest."]},{"type":"*","value":["Carry water! This is vital.

There'll be lots of sand, too, which can be excruciatingly hot, and many sharp rocks, so flip-flops are a no-no."]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Lagunas Altiplanicas"]},"\nFeel like visiting the Atacama salt pan, a picturesque village, and some Alp-lookalikes in a single day? Plus eating some local food? Then this is your thing. Usually advertised as 'Altiplanic Lagoons', the tour varies very little, if at all, between agencies. You'll be visiting the village of Toconao, renowned for its church and bell-tower; Laguna Chaxa, a national reservation which three species of flamingos inhabit year-round, located at the heart of the Atacama salt pan; Miscanti and Miñiques lagoons, located above 4,000m, and home to a variety of local fauna; and Socaire, a tiny hamlet that lives from selling lunch to tourists-it usually includes home-grown potatoes, big beans, carrots, and quinoa, plus a few other things. The tour usually leaves town at 8 AM, and returns at 4 PM. \nIf you plan on going, please consider the following:\n",{"type":"*","value":["Be wary of the salt pan, as it reflects sunlight in the way that snow does. Wear pants and long sleeves, carry a hat, and wear sunglasses, unless you enjoy the prospect of developing blindness and skin cancer."]},{"type":"*","value":["Miscanti and Miñiques are usually windy... very much so, to be honest.

The tour sets off at variable times (since Chile follows DST), but always in the afternoon, around 3-4 PM. Besides the Cejar and Piedra lagoons, excursions usually stop by the 'Ojos del Salar' (Eyes of the Salt Pan), two freshwater eyes very close together, and lake Tebenquinche, a water mirror that offers the absolute best sunsets in the whole area-imagine the mountains slowly changing colors, from yellow to pink, and that same image reflected on the lake's perfect surface!\nYou can get there by bike, but bear in mind that it's a long ride: 50km for the round-trip, with the sun burning your scalp without any mercy. There are shorter paths, but the safest is the main road; to get there, just ask where the customs ('aduana') are, and then travel south until you see a sign that reads 'Laguna Cejar'. The road's paved, and drivers are accustomed to see bikers on it. Wear bright clothing (red, blue and yellow work best), just in case. You shouldn't have any trouble locating it, for there are other signs along the way. If you'd like to visit the other lagoons, besides Piedra and Cejar, you can try asking the employee at Cejar's entry. Spanish is required, though. Unfortunately, no maps show the paths between Cejar and the others, but a simple compass can get you there-ride south, following the tracks of the agencies' vehicles.

They're commonly called 'Hot Springs', but that name couldn't be more of a misnomer. The Puritama (means 'hot water' in Kunza) is actually a ",{"type":"'''","value":["warm river"]},", that breaks loose from the stone a few meters away from the actual place. Water temperature usually is around 33ºC. It is amazingly clear and pure, and hosts a budding population of rainbow trout (don't worry, they're tiny and harmless). The \"hot springs\" are property of Hotel Explora, a five-star brand located in all of Chile's hot spots. The facilities are basic, yet elegant and extremely functional. The entry fee's something to watch out for: 10,000 pesos (20 USD). If you can spare the money, you won't regret it; the landscape's stunning, and the water perfect. Ancient agricultural terraces line the canyon-sides, along with massive stone walls, and even some cacti.\nThe layout of the place is as follows: there are eight artificial pools, cleverly made with volcanic rocks, so that they mesh perfectly with the scenery. Guides and drivers typically recommend the fourth and fifth ones; unless you're there early, forget about them. Go for the seventh.

It usually comprises three destinations: Pukara de Quitor, Aldea de Tulor, and the R.P. Gustavo Le Paige archaeological museum. Pukara de Quitor is an ancient fortress, most likely built in the tenth century. It's quite close to San Pedro-only 4km away. The view from the summit is breathtaking. Aldea de Tulor is the oldest village in the Atacama basin, approx. 3,000 years old, and kept in pristine condition. It's part of the Los Flamencos national reservation, and has small exhibits on archeology (worthless) and local flora and fauna (worth a visit). Last, but not least, is the museum. It holds a decent collection of original ",{"type":"''","value":["atacameño"]}," pieces, along with some acquired by the ancient inhabitants of San Pedro through trade-these are most exotic. The main exhibit is only in spanish, though, but you can hire a guided tour in spanish, english and french. The schedule for these is published in the museum itself-take a look around. Special, private tours are also available in italian, german, and portuguese; you must reserve these at least two days before. The guides are very capable. The museum also sports a small, but well-stocked souvenir store. They carry some of the finest hand-crafted pieces to be had in San Pedro, plus an interesting assortment of specialized books in spanish and english.\nYou can visit these places by cycling, or even on foot. The museum's right by the ",{"type":"''","value":["Plaza de Armas"]},", the main square. Most bike rentals will give you a map of the area; it should clearly point out where the Pukara is.

The place is well above 4,500m-consider it carefully, as it's not uncommon for people to get altitude-sickness. After that, it's a visit to some peculiar stone formations, obsidian quarries, more stone towers (called 'Catedrales'), and the huge Tara salt lake. Fauna is abundant, and particular to that environment. The landscape is stunning at all times-it's easy to catch glimpses of Bolivia here and there, as well. Traffic is light, as this destination's not really popular. If that matters to you, then taking this tour is the perfect way of saying 'I was off the beaten track of San Pedro de Atacama'.

The \"Hierbas Buenas\" petroglyph site is the first, featuring over a thousand ancient stone carvings from the ancient \"atacameño\" people. They're from all time periods, from the first caravaners to the Incas. Most tours just visit sites 1 and 2, but that should be enough to afford a pretty nifty panorama of these ancient people's history. The other four sites are of difficult access.\nThen you've got the village of Matancilla, which is only habited according to season. If you go there in winter, be assured you'll find it deserted. The inhabitants grow a variety of crops, which are easily distinguished all through autumn. Dead wild donkeys are all too common, on the side of the road, while goats and llamas are harder to spot.\nFinally, you've got the namesake for the place: the ever-stunning Rainbow Valley, a series of hills that display countless colors, from white to black, from blue to red. Usually, all tours visit two of the four roads available, where the best views are to be had: The \"cathedrals\" and the great valley. Next to the former, to the left side, are some ever-mysterious buildings, made partially of serpentine, which gives them a light green color. They're well-camouflaged, so you'll have to climb to actually see them. On the way back from these \"cathedrals\", there's a beautiful hill that displays a wealth of colors; if the guide doesn't offer you to walk down the slope, ask for it! It's certainly worthwhile.\nYou can watch a similar spectacle in Argentina, on the \"Cerro de Siete Colores\", but you'll miss the petroglyphs. It might be worth it to rather book a tour in San Pedro, especially since most tourists are completely oblivious of the Rainbow Valley's existence, so you'll most likely be alone when you visit.\nMost of the advice given for other excursions applies here.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Mountain Climbing"]},"\nThe environs of San Pedro de Atacama sport a large variety of mountains to climb, catering to many levels of difficulty.

An oxygen tank and climbing rods are the least you should expect.\nThe easiest mountains to climb are Cerro Toco (5604m) and Volcán Lascar (5510m)-they're fairly popular, and take no longer than a day to complete. Higher in difficulty are Cerro Pili (6064m), and Sairecabur (5971m). The beautiful Licancabur Volcano, which towers over the town, is a real challenge; although only 5916m high, it takes at least three days to complete, not counting an exacting preparation period. Another choice is the Kimal mountain (4276m); even when its altitude is not that impressive, it's surrounded in myth and legend. According to local folklore, the \"princess Kimal\" is extremely jealous, and enjoys snatching adventurers away. There's even a supposed season for climbing her, when she's more pleasant; of course, no agency will tell ever you this beforehand. Take the chance at your own risk.

Until a few months ago, the operation of these ATMs was sketchy, due to frequent money shortages; now, with greater variety, this has somewhat improved. A tip: if an ATM refuses to give you money, it could be because its supply of a certain denomination is spent. Try with a different amount.
