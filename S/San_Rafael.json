Gang violence has reached a high level and is increasing at disturbingly high rates, with stabbings and\/or shootings occurring every few weeks. The downtown area does have a higher amount of car break ins than one might expect.\n\nIf you decide to venture into the Canal District, ",{"type":"'''","value":["stay alert"]},", even in the daytime. The District is home to many first-generation immigrants who densely populate apartment buildings to offset the relatively high cost of living, and street gangs are relatively common. Try not to wear too much red- or blue-colored clothing—you may be confused as a rival to another gang and approached. It is best not to walk around the Canal District at night, even if traveling with someone else. The neighborhood has a fairly high amount of gang violence, robbery, and car theft. If driving through the Canal District, it is best to keep your windows rolled up and your doors locked at all times. Not all parts of the Canal District are dangerous, but on some streets you can literally see massive amounts of broken glass where car windows have been smashed. Novato Street is the street with most gang members hanging out. However, it is home to some of the best Latin food in the Bay Area. West of Kerner is more dangerous than East of Kerner, which has nice town homes along the water.\n\nParts of Downtown, Terra Linda, and near Woodland Avenue have a lot of crime as well so just be aware of your surroundings there and don't dress all in red or blue. A lot of strange people hang out around the Northgate Mall area in Terra Linda, so be watchful there. There is a lot of drug-related activity around the apartments near the mall.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Nearby ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fairfax (California)"],["Fairfax"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Larkspur"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Francisco"]]}," is just a 20-30 minute drive south on 101."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Head over the hill to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Stinson Beach"]]}," on the Pacific Coast."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Continue north on 101 towards ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Napa Valley"]]}," and the wine country."]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=I-580.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["directionl1=W"],["majorl1=END"],["minorl1="],["directionr1=E"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oakland"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Richmond (California)"],["Richmond"]]}],["image2=US_101.svg"],["imagesize2=22"],["directionl2=N"],["majorl2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Santa Rosa (California)"],["Santa Rosa"]]}],["minorl2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Novato"]]}],["directionr2=S"],["majorr2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Francisco"]]}],["minorr2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Corte Madera"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["37.973611"],["-122.531111"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Marin County"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:San Rafael, California"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North America\/United States\/California\/Localities\/S\/San Rafael"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:San Rafael, California"]]}]
