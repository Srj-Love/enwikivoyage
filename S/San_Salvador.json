[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["WV banner San Salvador Cathedral Santa Tecla.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.elsalvador.travel\/ San Salvador"]}]}," is the capital city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["El Salvador"]]},", approximately in the center of the country in a valley near the base of the San Salvador volcano. The city has a long history, with origins dating back to the Spanish conquest of the Pipil tribes.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Catedral de San Salvador.jpg"],["thumb"],["350px"],["The new National Cathedral, facing Plaza Barrios in the city centre"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nSan Salvador lies in the \"Valle de las Hamacas\" (literally \"Valley of the hammocks\", as it was called by the Pipil, due to its intense earthquake activity) at the foot of the San Salvador volcano. It covers an area of 600 square km and is home to nearly 2 million people. It is home to one-third of El Salvador's population and one-half of the country's wealth. The downtown area is filled with shops and modern buildings, but unfortunately earthquakes have damaged or destroyed many of the city's historic buildings.\n\nThe people of San Salvador are generally friendly, though as in any large city, less inclined to engage in conversations with strangers on the street as opposed to other parts of the country.  The wealthy live in exclusive suburbs behind tall security walls or luxury condominium buildings.  Wealthier areas such as San Benito, Colonia Escalon, Colonia San Francisco, Colonia Maquilishuat, Santa Elena (where the US embassy is located) and Ciudad Merliot have tree-lined avenues, the biggest malls in Central America, bars, clubs, gyms, restaurants, luxury hotels, modern high-rise buildings, plazas, boutiques, cafes, luxury salons, jewelry stores, etc.  Some of these neighborhoods are located in the hills surrounding the city and have breathtaking views. A number of new gated housing communities complete with parks, swimming pools, fitness facilities and tight security are popular with middle class families. Most of the city's hotels can be found in these suburbs.\n\nThere are middle class neighborhoods and residential areas close to the wealthy neighborhoods. Poorer areas are located in the northern and eastern districts, along with an abundance of shanty towns sprawling along the city's fringes.\n\nSan Salvador's climate is tropical, although the weather can vary; the nights may be cool (especially in December), however, most of the time it is sunny and warm.  Wearing t-shirts, jeans, and possibly a light rain jacket is usually sufficient.\n\nWhilst not on most tourists' \"to do\" list in El Salvador, the capital provides a good base for exploring the rest of the country as it's a transportation hub, with most major roads running through it due to its central location. Spending a few days exporing this cosmopolitan and internationally-conscious city can be a rewarding experience. Whilst parts can seem like a maze of confusion, rich vs poor, modern vs dilapitaded, cars vs pedestrians, the city has played a major role in defining and shaping the rest of this small yet intruiging country, once at the forefront of the Cold War. To understand this polarized country, it is essential to understand its political, cultural and social headquarters.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nTravelers arriving by air will fly into Comalapa International Airport (SAL), the biggest airport in Central America, which is located 45 minutes by highway from the city.\n\nFor budget travelers the local bus can take you from the airport into downtown San Salvador for $0.70 US. It is slower than the shuttles and can take up to an hour to get into town. To reach the local buses; cross the big parking lot. Then go through an open building to reach the road. There is a bus-stop. \n\nIf you drive to San Salvador from Comalapa, please exercise extreme caution. There are many residents who walk this highway as well as cross it. There are many accidents with vehicles speeding as well as people who are hit.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Microbus.jpg"],["thumb"],["Old Micro Bus in San Salvador.

Buses and taxis also provide good ways of getting around. Negotiating the cost of your taxi, Before you step in, is common practice and expected. Carry small denominations of money and have exact change for your taxi fare. If you do not have exact change, taxi drivers will try to convince you to make the change a tip instead. Distances between sights make walking an unpopular option, as does the street layout in the city; San Salvador is not a square city but has long avenues that are straight and streets that are not. That said, in some areas walking is a great option, such as from Zona Rosa to Las Terrazas (Sheraton hotel) which are close together and within sight of one another.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Boulevards"]},"\n\nSan Salvador has wide avenues and boulevards, including the two widest boulevards in Central America: ",{"type":"'''","value":["Boulevard de los Proceres"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Boulevard de los Heroes"]},".

One of the most recognizable monuments in El Salvador is the Monumento al Divino Salvador del Mundo, or \"Monument to the Saviour of The World\".\n\nThe Metropolitan Cathedral has the tomb of Monsignor Oscar Romero (enter from right-side entrance), open from 8 AM to 12 PM, 2 PM to 4:45 PM daily.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Business"]},"   \n\nFeria Internacional de El Salvador is the largest convention center in Central America.
