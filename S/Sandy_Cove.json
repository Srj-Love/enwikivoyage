This name did not last for long however and the community was soon named for the wide beach at the bottom of the broad open cove.

On one end of the 2km beach is an area known as ",{"type":"''","value":["\"Caplin Gulch,\""]}," where, in late June\/July you can see the caplin \"roll\" as they come into the shore to spawn on the beach.
