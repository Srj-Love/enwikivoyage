[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Sanibel Island"]]}]}," ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.mysanibel.com"]}," is a city in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Florida"]]},", entirely encompassing a barrier island west of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fort Myers"]]},". Sanibel is known as a quiet, natural travel destination, well-suited for families.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nSanibel is not at all a stereotypical \"Spring Break\" type of destination.  Its primary attractions are its birds, seashells, and sunsets, and many families travel here for a quiet getaway.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Sanibel Island sailboat (737558).jpg"],["thumb"],["Sailboat at sunset, off Sanibel Island"]]},"\nSanibel is flat, long (12 miles), and narrow (3 miles at its widest).  On the west, its beaches face the Gulf of Mexico.  To the east, Sanibel borders Pine Island Sound and San Carlos Bay.  The majority of the waterfront on the Sound is part of J.N. \"Ding\" Darling National Wildlife Refuge, including the calm waters of Tarpon Bay.\n\nPeople looking for well-groomed white-sand beaches on Sanibel may be disappointed.  The beaches are less maintained and more natural than in many locations.  Seashell collectors will be pleasantly surprised by the density of seashells.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Seasonal variations"]},"\nThe peak travel season in Sanibel is January through April.  Southwest Florida has some of the nation's mildest weather during this time, making this particular area appealing to winter-weary travelers.  September and October are the island's quietest months, with some businesses shutting down for several weeks of the year.\n\nSummers in southwest Florida can be oppressively hot and humid, but during the other months of the year Sanibel is a mild and pleasant environment.  Even in the summers Sanibel's ocean breezes can eliminate some of the stifling heat.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nMost travelers arrive by automobile, crossing the Sanibel Causeway (a one-way toll of $6 applies at the time of this writing).  There are no airports on the island and no ferry service from the mainland.\n\nSanibel Island is less than 25 miles from Southwest Florida International Airport. Follow Daniels Parkway west to Summerlin Road, then Summerlin Road south and west to McGregor Boulevard, which leads to the Sanibel Causeway.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nPosted speed limits are enforced by local police, who will remind you why you have come to Florida's islands.  Most roads will have limits of 35 MPH or less, through both residential areas and protected wildlife zones. Beware of the infamous double stop signs of Sanibel. They are posted like that because they are often missed. Be particularly careful to mind the speed limit at night. There are not many roads on the Island and at night there is virtually always someone watching them. Watch for pedestrians and cyclists.\n\nOn the eastern half of the island, the main road through the city is Periwinkle Way.  A variety of side streets connect this road with the beaches, shops, restaurants, and lodging on the island.\n\nOn the western half of the island, the main road is Sanibel-Captiva Road, or \"San-Cap\".  Fewer roads connect to this one, which is bordered by protected lands on both sides for much of its length. At the end of San-Cap where the two islands meet at Blind Pass, this area is called \"Santiva\", a portmanteau of Sanibel and Captiva.\n\nRunning parallel to both these roads, along the southern shore of the island, is Gulf Drive.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bicycle"]},"\nThere are 22 miles of cycling paths on Sanibel.  With no hills to speak of, cycling can be a rewarding way to see the island.  However, shops are located more than two miles from most lodging locations. It is recommended to rent a vehicle, since riding past sunset is impossible as there are no street lights on Sanibel. Numerous local businesses rent bicycles, and some hotels\/inns have bikes for their guests to use without charge.  When setting off on a bicycle, remember to bring along water and sunscreen, and to obey all traffic laws.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nYou will see that the gorgeous natural beaches are sometimes ankle-deep in beautiful shells, sponges, driftwood, sand dollars, and so on. Shells can sometimes cover a lot of the sand. Beach oats and other \"wild looking\" plants grow between the homes and the water's edge. Washed up you will find seaweed and other interesting marine life. Those plants are not \"weeds,\" and this is not a \"dirty\" beach. These are all signs of a wild unspoiled  beach, and Sanibel and Captiva Islands are making every attempt to keep these beautiful islands in their natural state. \n\nThe island is lush with bougainvillea and other brilliantly colored flowers and shrubs nearly all year long. This is definitely a sub-tropical climate. Tiny lizards scurry about (even in and out of restaurants) and you might see lots of cute, tiny tree frogs stuck to your condo door when you come home at night! \n\nHave insect repellant with DEET on hand; you will probably need it for a couple of hours around dawn and dusk because of the sand flies (also called midges or \"no-see-ums\") that come out then, if there is no wind blowing. You literally cannot see the \"no-see-ums\" and they are so small that they go right through the fly screens on balconies and lanais. Some folks feel the biting, but their skin does not react badly, whereas a few people will show little red marks after a couple of hours and these sometimes can itch and remain for a week. Some fortunate people not only do not react to the no-see-um bites but don't even feel the biting.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Birds"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.fws.gov\/dingdarling"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=At the J.

Lots of townhome and condo complexes are across from the beach. Still just a hop, skip and jump from the water, but unless you spend a lot of time on the beach itself all day, you'll miss the view! Most private rental homes are across the street from the beach or on the inner parts of the island. \n\nDogs and cats are allowed in some (but not many) of the condo\/townhome complexes.
