The fortress's first components were  built in 1245 by Count Diether von Katzenelnbogen. Other rulers of the region made their own contributions to the construction castle. It was eventually ruined by members of the French Revolutionary Army when they were invading the area. Despite its partially ruined state, the fortress retains a strong sense of dignity and strength.\n\n: While visiting Burg Rheinfels it is important to note that the current overall size of the castle is only one fifth of its original size before the destruction of it by the French Army in 1797. One way to understand the former size of the fortress is to explore the underground tunnels built during the 30 Years War. These tunnels were built under the flat, undefended plain to the West of the castle by the garrison of the castle. The tunnels were filled with gunpowder, and in theory, as an approaching enemy army neared the castle by way of the flat plain, the gunpowder would be ignited and eventually explode, sending the enemy army falling to their death. However this secret weapon was never put to use so the tunnels formerly housing gunpowder can be visited today. It is a tight fit and flashlights are needed."]]}]},"\n'''On the right Rhine side:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["St. Goarshausen"]]}," with the Burg Katz and Burg Maus"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Loreley"]}]},{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Loreley mit tal von linker rheinseite.jpg"],["thumb"],["640px"],["center"],["Lorely panoramic view from the left Rhine side"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["St. Goarshausen"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oberwesel"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bacharach"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bingen"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boppard"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Koblenz"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["de:St. Goar"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["50.1500"],["7.7167"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Middle Rhine Valley"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Sankt Goar"]]}]
