In the inner Alpine region, there are twelve of these figures, with ten Samsons in the Lungau (Mariapfarr, Mauterndorf, Muhr, Ramingstein, St. Andrä, St. Margarethen, St. Michael, Tamsweg, Unternberg  and Wölting) and two in neighboring Styria (Krakaudorf und Murau). \n\nThis heroic biblical figure is the emblem of the Lungau.
