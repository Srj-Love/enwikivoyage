If any city can claim to be \"the center of Silicon Valley,\" it is this town of just over 100,000. Intel, AMD, WebEx, NVIDIA, and National Semiconductor all have headquarters here. At the same time, Santa Clara is one of the oldest settlements (by Europeans) in Northern California. The Mission Santa Clara de Asís was established in 1777, and the Jesuit-run Santa Clara University, founded in 1851, is the oldest university in California. Dozens of 19th century homes are well-maintained by their 21st century owners in the \"old quad,\" the earliest residential area, adjacent to the university. \n\nYet another contrast is the diversity of the local population, driven by the tech boom of the 1970s-1990s. Visitors from Asia and Europe frequently overhear strangers speaking their native languages. Specialty markets offer native ingredients from around the world, and the Indian and East Asian restaurants are some of the best in the Bay Area. But many of the best places in Santa Clara are not visible at first glance. You could drive right through this town and see nothing of any interest, or you could take the time to learn where to look, explore, and enjoy.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nJust west of San Jose, Santa Clara is adjacent to San Jose Mineta Airport (SJC). \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Caltrain"]}," stops at Santa Clara Station, on the east side of Santa Clara University (1001 Railroad Avenue).

The new buildings represented a more modern attitude toward the mentally ill. The smaller buildings with larger windows were designed to comfort and stimulate the mentally ill, rather than imprison them. The state of California moved the last few hundred residents out in the mid 1990s, and sold the campus to Sun Microsystems, who promised to preserve the grounds and buildings, and make the auditorium and executive mansion available for public events.
