But there are hundreds of interesting attractions and things to do in the valley.  Whether you want to get up close to bison, big cats, horses, or farm animals, you can do it here. The Hollywood's movie production in Santa Clarita dates back to the industry's infancy, and is still going strong, so there are many ways you can experience Hollywood in this suburban utopia. If it's the Old West you want to experience, you can do that in the SCV as well.\n\nThe City of Santa Clarita was incorporated in 1987, so much of the valley has a new, \"Disneyland\" feel to it.

This could be a contributing factor to why Santa Clarita has often been named in the top safest places to live in the country.\n\nOne of the things often discussed among the residents is the lack of nightlife. While you won't find a plethora of clubs and bars, there are several available.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nAlthough the SCV hotel occupancy rates are some of the highest in Los Angeles County, it's a great place to stay as many of them are quite new. The SCV's close proximity to the ocean (45 minutes), Hollywood (40 minutes), Beverly Hills (45 minutes), Disneyland (1.5 hours), and Santa Barbara (1.5 hours) make it a great place to settle into 'base camp' to explore all that the Los Angeles area has to offer.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Los Angeles"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Santa Clarita Valley"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["34.398"],["-118.522"]]}]
