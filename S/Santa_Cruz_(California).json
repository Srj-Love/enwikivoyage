It is best known as a countercultural hub, with a bohemian feel and youthful vibe, and fun weekend tourist attractions like the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk"]}," and the dubious ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mystery Spot"]},". The rather relaxed beach lifestyle is supplemented by some remaining high tech industry and a vibrant university culture. The University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) is regarded as one of the premier centers of higher learning in the region and was once well known for its strong emphasis on the arts and humanities. \n\nThe beaches north and south of Santa Cruz are considered some of the more pristine areas of natural beauty in central California.  A variety of conditions prevail, depending on the beach, few are suited for swimming due to temperature and current, several are considered an expert surfer's cold cold paradise.  The beautiful beaches and the rather mild climate play a central role in local culture.  Most visitors leave Santa Cruz amazed by the city's beauty and ambiance.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nHighway 17 south from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Jose (California)"],["San Jose"]]}," is the most direct route when driving from the more populated parts of the Bay Area. It is a winding and very dangerous road over the mountains, arguably the most hazardous in the state shared during the week with heavy gravel trucks, so heed the speed limits take it easy and arrive alive. ; Accidents are very common, but the road is a bit  safer since the addition of concrete barriers some years ago. Beware of fog, as well as \"hurried\" drivers.Drive with caution especially when roads are wet.\n\nTo merge from Highway 17 to Highway 1 in Santa Cruz to continue south, you must merge three times on the dreaded \"fish hook\". This causes the beginning of the dreaded commute from \"over the hill\" to the coast for many. Traffic usually lasts from 3pm until 6pm, Monday through Friday, from just south of 41st Ave. on Highway 1, spilling back onto Highway 17 going south. \n\nA much more beautiful, but slower, approach to Santa Cruz is on Highway 1, either from the north, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Francisco"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pacifica"]]}," (about 65 miles), or from the south, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Monterey (California)"],["Monterey"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Big Sur"]]}," (about 35 miles).  During stormy seasons, check for rare, but often long-term road closures, especially at Devil's Slide (although a bypass tunnel is due to open in late 2012).\n\nTo take public transportation there is a commuter shuttle, the Highway 17 Express (Santa Cruz route 17; VTA route 970), that runs from the Caltrain station in San Jose 7 days a week, which is scheduled to transfer with certain Amtrak trains. There are also multiple lines that go south to Watsonville 7 days a week. Greyhound also runs buses to the city. All these lines go to, or near to, the Santa Cruz Metro Center, which is in the downtown area.\n\nThe nearest major airport is in San Jose (SJC), but San Francisco (SFO) and even ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oakland"]]}," (OAK) aren't much farther away, and sometimes have cheaper flights.  The small regional airport in Monterey (MRY) has flights to major hubs (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Los Angeles"]]},", San Francisco, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sacramento"]]},"), but in most cases San Jose is the best choice because of the greater choice of airlines and destinations.  Scheduled airport shuttles provide service every few hours to San Jose, and less often to San Francisco.  Caltrain also provides a route to the San Francisco airport, through a transfer with BART in Milbrae. For private aircraft, there'a 2,000 ft. runway about 10 miles northwest of downtown, near Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nThe main downtown strip is pedestrian friendly, and it's a 20 minute stroll from there to the beach. Walking to the University of California Santa Cruz from downtown is a little more difficult, with bad or non-existent sidewalks and a very steep climb. \n\nWhile driving is certainly an option (parking is tight, careful to not get ticketed), ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.scmtd.com Santa Cruz Metro"]},"  provides bus service.  \n\nSanta Cruz can be a wonderful town for town for cycling, but be careful because drivers are no better here than in many other places. Around town and along Highway 1 is easy, but roads in the Santa Cruz Mountains are steep, winding and challenging for many cyclists. Be careful. Collisions between bicycles and cars are often reported. A number of pedestrian and car collisions have also happened in the downtown area.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:SantaCruzSeaLion.JPG"],["thumb"],["A sea lion on the Santa Cruz Municipal Wharf"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Mission Santa Cruz"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.parks.ca.gov\/?page_id=548"],["email="],["address=126 High St"],["lat=36.978112"],["long=-122.029423"],["directions=at Emmett, one block north of Mission"],["phone= +1 831 425-5849"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=10AM to 4PM, Thu-Sat (& Sun during the Summer).
