This book inspired the beginnings of the eco-tourism that today dominates the Galapagos economy. Tourism began, however, as only a trickle (one of those early tourists was U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who visited the islands in 1938). There was also a trickle of Europeans immigration to the Galapagos around this time. The largest group was 60 Norwegians, persuaded to settle on Floreana in 1927 by several young journalists and a whaler who had written about the Galapagos. Floreana turned out to be anything but the paradise the promoters promised, as the colonists came to realize after the promoters left. Most managed to survive for a difficult year or two there. Some of the survivors eventually returned to Norway, others moved to the settlement on ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Cristobal (Galapagos)"],["San Cristobal"]]},", and others settled on Academy Bay on Santa Cruz, joining another group of Norwegians that had set up a cannery there the year before. Within a few years, most of the colonists left as well, but a few remained. A few years later, other Norwegians came to Santa Cruz, as well as a sprinkling of others from Europe, America, and Ecuador, all seeking a simpler life. Among them were the four Angermeyer brothers from Germany, who settled on Santa Cruz in 1935. Their descendants still live there and operate touring yachts and a hotel in Puerto Ayora.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Puerto Ayora"]]}]}," - largest town in on the island and the only one with tourist accommodation"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Santa Rosa"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bella Vista"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cascajo"]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nAccess to Santa Cruz is almost exclusively by air, with planes landing at the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Baltra#Get in"],["Baltra airport"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nThe only paved road on the island is between the Itabaca channel and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Puerto Ayora"]]},".
