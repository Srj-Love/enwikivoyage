Because of this country´s history, from the times when the first humans arrived up until today, population distribution and land surface is inversely proportional in these three regions. The altiplano is the smallest and has the biggest portion of the population, the lowlands occupy more than 1\/2 of the country and have about 1\/3 of its population. Original natives in all three areas are also of different ethnic origins. All this is explained simply because since colonial times, Bolivia was a mining country in which the economy was based in the mines that were located high in the mountains and the valleys fed them. The rest was the frontier.\n\nSanta Cruz is in the lowlands at the east of the country and for its first 400 years was very poor and far from potential markets to be able to grow at all. It shares this with the rest of eastern, northern  and south eastern Bolivia for most of its history, up until some 50 years ago when a paved road was opened and the possibility of markets opened which summed with some royalties from oil production they also started receiving served as seed to one of the fastest growing cities and economies in the continent. Growth was slow to start but after some 20 years it was spectacular. Today it is difficult to imagine this city and provincial towns of the department for what they really were some 25 or 50 years ago. \n\nOne very interesting testimony of this history can be downloaded (in Spanish for free) from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The document is called ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.idh.pnud.bo\/webportal\/Publicaciones\/InformeRegional\/IDHenSantaCruz\/tabid\/123\/ItemId\/93\/Default.aspx Informe de Desarrollo Humano de Santa Cruz"]}," and the first chapter relates the history of Santa Cruz in this last half of the 20th century.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Santa Cruz (city, Bolivia)"],["Santa Cruz"]]}," - The capital."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Puerto Suarez"]]}," \/ ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Puerto Quijarro"]]}," - On the border with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brazil"]]},"."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Samaipata"]]}," — 2.5 hours east of Santa Cruz with ",{"type":"'''","value":["heavenly climate"]}," and lots of things to do and see"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jesuit Missions of the Chiquitos"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nSanta Cruz de la Sierra or Santa Cruz city is a boomtown whose population has increased tenfold in the last 25 years, it is almost in the center of Bolivia and is the capital city of the department of Santa Cruz. It lies at one end of the Death Train's line.\n\nThis department concentrates 27% of the country´s population, several of the major universities of Bolivia and it's responds for over 30% of the country wealth production, forty something percent of the national taxes. It´s population is variate, some 40% of it´s inhabitants were born elsewhere (mainly in the rest of the Bolivian departments). They seek what more of what they cal they call \"Autonomia\" which means autonomy and intends to separate more functions from the central government in a way similar to Spain government system, more independent and locally managed. In this country like many others of South America, citizens have to support the burden of time and cost of doing most bureaucratic administrative procedures from far away from La Paz in a corrupt and inefficient system.\n\nWhen the Spaniards originally arrived to these lands, they came from Paraguay and Argentina. The local indigenous peoples came from two lines, or as they are called Tupi-Guarani. The first, the Tupi originally came from the Caribbean through the Amazon jungle down to these latitudes. The Guarani´s came here down the Atlantic coast through what today is Brazil and Argentina, and upriver from there. They were the original humans in this region and they had gone well into the lower Andes. In actual times it is only possible to find possible reminders of the onetime greatness of this two cultures in Moxos (Beni department) or in southern Bolivia or northern Argentina and it requires investigation because little is known and they are not part of touristic routes.\n\nThe blend of these three and other latecomers are the local native population, they call themselves \"Camba or Cambas\". These people are mostly of peasant origin that dedicated itself to farming related activities, this still is the main department´s activity. Today, with the migrations of this last quarter century these people are maybe around one half of the local population. One interesting characteristic of this region is that most of the more recently arrived inhabitants have integrated fairly well. Obviously there are exceptions to this. Being a land with so many bloods, sympathy and tolerance to outsiders is fairly high by any standard.\n\nOne interesting characteristic of the \"Cruceños\" or people from Santa Cruz is that apparently they prefer not having to work in public services (Government, armed forces, police, diplomatic services, church, others) and as some one said, they don´t migrate, they just move around. This probably explains why of some 100 Bolivian presidents in almost two centuries, only three were from Santa Cruz department. And all three were military, which is a factor that changes people through doctrines imbeded into its members during their careers.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nThe country´s official language and main language is Spanish.  However, most places (stores specially) will be able to understand Portuguese and English.  If they do not speak those languages, they will probably get someone that does.  The people are REALLY friendly, they will try their truly best to talk to you if you are a foreigner.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nDirect airplane flights are available to and from Santa Cruz city regularly several times a week and in cases a day to most South American countries, Miami in the USA, and Madrid in Spain.

The name does not reflect the degree of safety of the train, but rather how many people died building the railroad along this route. \n\nSo, if you are in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Corumba"]]},", a Brazilian border city, you just have to cross the frontier, take a taxi to the train station in Bolivia (they don't accept Brazilian taxi drivers there) and go to the train station. Depending on the class of train you want to take, it will take a different time to get to Santa Cruz.\n\nIf you are coming in from Argentina or Paraguay, you will have to come in by highway (bus or other), information is available in any major city´s bus station. Trains are occasionally available from the Argentine border.\n\nNote: Several countries have consulates in Santa Cruz city in case of necessity.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nGet a Taxi.
