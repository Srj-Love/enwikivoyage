And with a population of about 70,000, it's not the most populous capital, but that's part of its charm. This is not a capital that bustles with politicians but one that bustles with tourists, who flood the narrow streets around the town's plaza in the summer months to take in the beautiful adobe architecture, the unique cultural heritage, and the spectacular art that make Santa Fe one of the world's top travel destinations.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nSanta Fe was once the capital of Spain's, and then Mexico's, territories north of the Rio Grande, but its visible history extends far beyond the arrival of the Spanish; it is thought to have been the site of Puebloan villages that had already been long abandoned by the time the Spanish arrived in 1607.  It became the state capital when the territory of New Mexico achieved statehood in 1912.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the area attracted a number of artists, such as Georgia O'Keeffe and Alfred Stieglitz. The region remains important on America's art scene.   The arrival of Igor Stravinsky and the founding of the Santa Fe Opera, one of the world's leading opera companies, had a similarly invigorating and enduring influence on the musical community.  Many people go to Santa Fe for spiritual gatherings and to practice meditative arts at the many spas and resorts that are in and around Santa Fe.\n\nSanta Fe is rooted in paradoxes.  On the one hand, it is one of the United States' oldest cities (by some reckonings ",{"type":"''","value":["the"]}," oldest), and many residents can trace their roots and property holdings in town back to the 17th century.  On the other hand, it has also been the target of a teeming influx of wealthy immigrants in the last 30 years or so that has spurred a great deal of new construction and created inflated prices for real estate—and drastically elevated taxes on old family properties, many of which are owned by families that can't afford the taxes.  The tension between new and old, rich and poor, etc., is a persistent undercurrent in the community.  These and other factors (not the least of which is a well-deserved reputation as a haven for flamboyant characters) contribute to Santa Fe's uniqueness.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Imperial"],["janhigh = 43"],["febhigh = 48"],["marhigh = 54"],["aprhigh = 64"],["mayhigh = 74"],["junhigh = 84"],["julhigh = 87"],["aughigh = 84"],["sephigh = 81"],["octhigh = 68"],["novhigh = 52"],["dechigh = 45"],["janlow = 19"],["feblow = 22"],["marlow = 26"],["aprlow = 34"],["maylow = 44"],["junlow = 53"],["jullow = 58"],["auglow = 56"],["seplow = 50"],["octlow = 39"],["novlow = 24"],["declow = 19"],["janprecip = 0.5"],["febprecip = 0.5"],["marprecip = 0.5"],["aprprecip = 0.4"],["mayprecip = 0.9"],["junprecip = 0.7"],["julprecip = 2"],["augprecip = 2.3"],["sepprecip = 0.6"],["octprecip = 0.6"],["novprecip = 0.3"],["decprecip = 0.3"],["description = ",{"type":"{{","value":[["ForecastNOAA"],["Santa Fe"],["35.6916"],["-105.93738"]]}]]},"\n\nMuch of the city's attractiveness, from both scenic and cultural perspectives, arises from its setting in the foothills of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sangre de Cristo Mountains"]]},". This location produces a mild continental climate with four distinct seasons. Winters are pleasant, with day-time highs usually in the 40s (Fahrenheit), often \"feeling\" warmer due to the sunny conditions. Snow varies wildly from year to year; some winters see almost no snow, while others will have several individual storms dropping a foot or more each. (The sun and high altitude mean that roads usually aren't clogged too badly, even by the big storms, for more than a day or two, as the snow melts rapidly.) Spring, usually dry and moderate in temperature, is still probably the least pleasant time to visit from a weather perspective, because of strong winds. Early summer (June, early July) is hot and dry, with highs around 90, but gives way around mid-July to a truly delightful climate as summer, monsoonal thunderstorms peel off the mountains and cool the afternoons down. Bring rainwear if visiting in July or August. The monsoons typically die out in early September leading to a fall with dry, sunny days and clear, crisp evenings; first frost is usually in October, with snow starting to stick in the mountains at about that time.\n\nOne caution: the elevation is high enough to challenge the lungs of the visitor freshly up from sea level.  It's wise to spend your first day on relatively sedentary activities (museums, walking the downtown area) and move to more active things after you've had some time to acclimatize.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/aa.com American Eagle Airlines"]}]}," serves the ",{"type":"{{","value":[["marker"],["type=listing"],["name=Santa Fe Municipal Airport"],["url=http:\/\/www.santafenm.gov\/index.asp?NID=171"],["lat=35.61771"],["long=-106.08665"]]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["SAF"]]},") with four daily flights from Dallas\/Fort Worth (two year-round, two seasonal), and one from Los Angeles.

The Santa Fe Depot will be more useful for sightseeing, as it puts you in the historic downtown area within relatively easy walking distance of the plaza, with a shuttle circulating around the downtown area if you don't want to walk. The South Capitol and NM 599 stations are meant more for commuters. The Rail Runner runs daily, although service can be limited outside the weekday rush hour periods.

The once-daily trains stop in Lamy mid-afternoon, and a shuttle van service can take you to Santa Fe. The station in Lamy has an old cafe car serving lunch, food vendors on the platform, and picnic tables beneath shady cottonwoods.\n\nThere is an excursion train from Santa Fe to Lamy (the Santa Fe Southern Railway, below under \"See\") which is a pleasant way to get to Lamy to board an Amtrak train, but it returns to Santa Fe before either Amtrak train arrives there.  Travelers with bicycles may find the shuttle van to Santa Fe is unable to transport their bicycles unless special arrangements have been made; an alternative is to send any luggage ahead via the shuttle and ride the bicycle - the rail line used by the excursion train is a federally designated rail trail but currently between Lamy and US 285 you must travel via the road.

This can be a good way of getting to lodging and restaurants on the north side of town (e.g. Gabriel's, cited below) as well; although it's a few miles out of the way, the much less chaotic driving, particularly around rush hour, provides considerable compensation.\n\nOnce you get to Santa Fe, consider taking a tour of downtown.  Several companies offer open-air tram tours, like ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.toursofsantafe.com Loretto Line Tours"]}," (available in the parking lot of the Loretto Chapel).

The Santa Fe Opera is known around the world for staging American and even world premieres of new works, the operas of Richard Strauss, and promising new artists on their way up (and, to be fair, one or two aging superstars each season who are on their way down, not up).  Opera season is the summer, with opening night (tickets are almost impossible to get) usually around July 1 and the last performances in mid-August.  (Bring a light jacket\/wrap and an umbrella to the later performances; the open-air nature of the house can make August performances nippy and drippy, although seats are protected from the rain.)  Many performances sell out well in advance, so book early.  (KHFM radio, frequency 95.5 MHz, airs a \"ticket exchange\" that may be helpful in finding tickets to sold-out performances, if you find yourself in town on the spur of the moment during opera season; they currently stream their broadcast ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.classicalkhfm.com online"]},", so you can check the ticket exchange even before you arrive.)

When deciding where to stay in Santa Fe, give particular thought to the balance of ambience and economy that fits your needs.\n\n\"Budget\" lodging (if any) will start at less than $75 a night, \"Mid-range\" from $75 to $150, and \"Splurge\" greater than $150, with some of the luxury suites, etc., ranging far upward.  A warning on the \"Budget\" and \"Mid-range\" classifications: Santa Fe hotels and motels are prone to very substantial seasonal variations in availability and price.  A hotel that may look like \"Mid-range\" during off season (spring, fall exclusive of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Albuquerque"]]}," International Balloon Fiesta week, usually in early October) may be \"Splurge\" material during ski season and the summer, particularly around significant events such as the Santa Fe Indian Market, Fiesta, opening weekend of the Santa Fe Opera, etc.  Of course, the converse is true as well, meaning you can stay at a \"Splurge\" hotel in the off-season months of November through February at a really low price. Check carefully on rates when booking; most of the more important hotels\/motels have informative web pages, and better hotels should give you the best price themselves, instead of letting discounters underprice them.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Budget"]},"\n\nBudget hotels and motels in Santa Fe are few and far between.

In reality, the crime rate, with the exception of residential burglary (a definite problem in town but one unlikely to affect the traveler), is not high compared to other American communities of comparable size, and the visitor is very unlikely to have any crime-related problems.  Some of the bars can get a little rough, with ethnic tensions frequently a factor despite the city's multicultural nature; simply don't stir up trouble and you should be OK.  Otherwise, public areas are generally quite safe, and are well yet unobtrusively patrolled by the city police.\n\nMuch more of a problem is automobile safety, for several reasons.  Many of the roads were built during a slower-paced, less-populous time, and lack the carrying capacity for the current crowds.  Northern New Mexico has serious problems with drunk driving, and Santa Fe is not exempt from these, particularly late at night.  Another factor is an inexplicably high density of bad drivers and\/or decrepit vehicles with poorly secured cargo; natives often speak of having a \"New Mexico moment\" when something falls off the back of a pickup or trailer and into the roadway in front of an unsuspecting driver.  This is a good place to practice your defensive driving, particularly along St. Francis Drive and Cerrillos Road (the intersection of these two has been voted the most dangerous intersection in all of New Mexico).  Running red lights is one of the state pastimes, and reaches its zenith in Santa Fe; be extremely vigilant when pulling away from an intersection when the light changes.  On the positive side, most motorists are fairly tolerant (if not always aware) of pedestrians and bicyclists.\n\nFinally, be alert for signs of health problems associated with high altitude, particularly if you venture out of town toward the mountains.  The most common problems are headache and\/or feeling tired may occur, drinking more water or going to lower altitude may help (a trip down La Bajada to the reservoir will usually do it). Also pay attention during hikes and bike rides, remember you are at 7,000 feet—sunscreen is important, even in the winter.
