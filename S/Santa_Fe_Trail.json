Check the park's web site well ahead of your arrival; as of August 2006, there were ranger-led walks once or twice a week that featured Trail sites and sights.  The Trail actually passed directly in front of the access road leading to the visitor center, but no ruts or other artifacts are obvious there.  Also on this road, just before the park, is a large complex built around remnants from the Kozlowski ranch and stagecoach stop, which featured in various Trail episodes.\n\nBeyond the park, you can hurry to Santa Fe along I-25, but there are a few things to see on the side roads that may interest you.  The town of Pecos is just west of the park, and while the town itself is of no great interest, a few nearby structures date to Trail days and are preserved.  Look in particular for an old adobe building at roadside (literallyâ€”it's about 5 feet from the highway, protected by a bumper) about three miles west of the center of town on NM 50.  This is the sole surviving structure from Pigeon's Ranch, one of the key sites in the Battle of Glorieta Pass.  Look but don't touch (it's on private property as well as seriously dilapidated), and hope that sporadic efforts to preserve this and surrounding battlefield sites come to something.\n\nNM 50 leads back to I-25, which you follow over Glorieta Pass itself; no Trail ruts are visible from here to Santa Fe.  Leave I-25 at the exit for Old Pecos Trail, which merges with the modern highway called \"Old Santa Fe Trail\" in south-central Santa Fe.  (You can go for slightly greater \"authenticity\" by continuing on NM 300 leaving the I-25 interchange either at Canocito or at the Eldorado exit, which is called the Old Las Vegas Highway. At the stop light with El Gaucho Way, turn right then turn left at the stop sign.  You are now on the Old Santa Fe Trail. Follow the road until you reach central Santa Fe)  Pause to enjoy the scenery; you've made it to the End of the Trail, just as the voyagers of the 19th century did.

Possibly your biggest \"wildlife\" concern is with ticks, which are prevalent along the route and can carry disease, so do a quick check of exposed body parts and near clothes seams after you hike.
