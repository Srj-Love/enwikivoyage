The railroad owners built the first version of the amusement park on Santa Monica pier as an attraction to fill empty train seats on weekends.  Santa Monica grew into an urban, eclectic, and prosperous beach city whose real estate values are amongst the most pricey in the world.  Santa Monica is a very desirable city whose people are drawn to its accessibility and its progressiveness as a community.  Today, Santa Monica is a mixture of very affluent, single-family neighborhoods, renters drawn by the high quality of life, lifelong surfers, young professionals and students.\n\nTourists visiting the Los Angeles region will find Santa Monica as one of the best situated locations to base their trip.  There are plenty of hotel, restaurant and entertainment options, as well as close accessibility to major sights like Venice Beach, Malibu and Beverly Hills.  Visitors will also note the beach cities' moderate climate; during the summer and fall, as the mercury soars to 100 in the San Fernando Valley and 90 downtown, Santa Monica usually remains at a very comfortable 75 degrees.\n\nSanta Monica has three ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.santamonica.com\/visitors\/plan-your-trip\/visitor-information Visitor Information Centers"]}," that feature experienced Travel Counselors, foreign language line, tickets to area attractions and free visitor information on attractions, hotels, dining, museums, galleries and entertainment.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nSanta Monica is located at the western terminus of the 10 (Santa Monica) Freeway, about 20 miles west of downtown Los Angeles and 7 miles north of Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).

By car, take the 10 Freeway to the 4th\/5th Street exit, then head left toward the ocean.  From the north, turn left off the Pacific Coast Highway (California 1) at the California Incline, which deposits you just a few blocks north of the pier.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nSanta Monica is accessible by ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.metro.net bus"]}," from throughout the Los Angeles region.
