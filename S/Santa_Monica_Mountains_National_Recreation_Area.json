Miles of scenic roads and hiking trails can be a welcome escape from ever-present Los Angeles traffic.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nThe establishment of the National Recreation Area in the Santa Monica Mountains was the culmination of over 75 years of conservation effort. A movement to preserve the park's unique natural environment has been under way, in one form or another, since the early years of the 20th century.\n\nThe adjacent Point Mugu State Park, Topanga State Park, and Malibu Creek State Park were created by the State of California prior to the establishment of the National Recreation Area, linking much of the public open space together, in 1978.\n\nThe Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy still continues to strategically acquire land for public use throughout the range as it becomes available.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\nThe Santa Monica Mountains feature distinct types of scenery. On the south-facing slopes, there are beautiful views of the Pacific Ocean. The ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Channel Islands (California)"],["Channel Islands"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Catalina Island"]]}," are visible on clear days.\n\nThe canyons offer shaded seasonal streams and hidden meadows.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\nThe Santa Monica Mountains are a chaparral ecosystem, consisting primarily of grasses and shrubs, such as sage and ceanothus, dotted with occasional stands of valley oak. This habitat supports many types of birds, small mammals, and reptiles.  Deer are common in the valleys, especially near lakes and streams.\n\nCoyotes are one of the primary predators in the region, and have adapted well living in proximity to human populations. They are not a serious threat to people, but visitors' pets should be kept indoors at night.\n\nMountain lions are also native to the Santa Monica Mountains. Their population is very small, but their range is extensive. If encountered, under no circumstances should they be approached or threatened.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nThe Santa Monica Mountains share Southern California's Mediterranean climate. Summer temperatures are typically in the 70s and 80s (°F), but can sometimes climb to over 100. Hikers are advised to bring adequate water supply and dress appropriately.\n\nWinter daytime temperatures are typically in the 60s (°F). Campground visitors are advised that temperatures can occasionally fall into the low 30s overnight.\n\nThe rainy season in Southern California approximately from October to April. Winter storms are sporadic, but can result in dangerous conditions. Soil saturated with water can become loose and hazardous, and landslides are not uncommon. Less frequently maintained trails may also be washed out and unusable after a particularly heavy rain. Be aware of the weather conditions and keep an eye on the forecast if visiting during this time.\n\nIn addition to seasonal changes, temperatures and conditions can often vary significantly by elevation. A hot day in the canyon areas may be cold and windy along the peaks exposed ridges.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["mapframe"],["34.108"],["-118.774"],["zoom=10"],["height=250"],["width=500"]]},"\n\nThere are many different points of access, as the Recreation Area is not contiguous.

Trail maps are available from the National Park Service site or the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. Outdoor and hiking supply retailers, such as REI, also offer trail maps for purchase.\n\nSince many of the trailheads are remote from urban areas, travel by car or motorcycle throughout the mountains is advantageous, if not entirely essential. There are several scenic canyon roads that connect the beaches and valleys that cross the mountains, as well as Mulholland Highway, which runs along much of the length of the range.\n\nBicycle, motorcycle, and car clubs frequently tour any (or all) of these roads, especially on weekends and during the summer months, so visitors are always advised to share the road, be alert, and practice patience. Narrow roads with blind corners, steep drops, and occasional rock slides do not recommend aggressive driving.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:King-Gillette-Ranch-01.jpg"],["thumbnail"],["right"],["King Gillette Ranch"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=King Gillette Ranch"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.nps.gov\/samo\/planyourvisit\/visitor-center.htm"],["email="],["address=26876 Mulholland Highway, Calabasas, CA, 91302"],["lat=34.1046"],["long=-118.7090"],["directions=Near the intersection of Las Virgenes Road and Mulholland Highway"],["phone=+1 805 370-2301"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=9AM-5PM"],["price=Free"],["content=The primary visitor's center for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.
