Pomo, Miwok, and Wappo Indians originally populated the area followed by the Spanish in the early 1800s. The first deeded land was held as the Rancho Cabeza de Santa Rosa and was given to Senora Maria Ignacia Lopez de Carrillo by Spanish authorities.\n\nIn 1867, the county recognized Santa Rosa as an incorporated city and in 1868 the state officially confirmed the incorporation, making it officially the third incorporated city in Sonoma County, after Petaluma, incorporated in 1858, and Healdsburg, incorporated in 1867.\n\nThe city continued to grow when other early population centers declined or stagnated, but by 1900 it had been, or was being, overtaken by many other newer population centers in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Francisco Bay Area"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southern California"]]},". According to a 1905 article in the Press Democrat newspaper reporting on the ",{"type":"''","value":["Battle of the Trains"]},", the city had just over 10,000 people at the time.\n\nThe April 18, 1906 San Francisco Earthquake essentially destroyed the entire downtown, but the city's population did not greatly suffer. However, after that period the population growth of Santa Rosa, as with most of the area, was very slow.\n\nIn 1943, Alfred Hitchcock filmed his thriller, ",{"type":"''","value":["Shadow of Doubt"]}," in Santa Rosa. He would continue to use Santa Rosa, and later ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bodega Bay"]]}," in many of his films. Thanks to this, Santa Rosa became, and continues to be a major hub in the Bay Area for numerous movies.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]}," \nSanta Rosa is 55 miles north of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Francisco"]]},", via Highway 101. Depending on traffic conditions, this drive is as brisk as an hour and as long as two hours. It is best to avoid the Highways during weekday rush hours, and on the weekend after sporting events. Beautiful and alternative routes exist on Highway 1, and through Sonoma Valley.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nGolden Gate Transit offers bus service out of San Francisco, and around the Bay Area every day of the week. The buses are large and comfortable, but are subject to the same traffic delays despite having access to the carpool lanes up and down Highway 101. \n\nGreyhound offers rides into Santa Rosa from around the Bay Area, including ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Francisco"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oakland"]]},", and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Santa Clara County"],["South Bay area"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Golden Gate Transit"]},", +1 415-455-2000, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.goldengatetransit.org"]}," from Sonoma and Marin counties."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Greyhound"]},", +1-800-231-2222, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.greyhound.com"]}," offers transit around the Bay Area."]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]}," \nYou can also fly ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/alaskaair.com Alaska Airlines"]}," to ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.sonomacountyairport.org\/ Charles M.

Most destinations are reachable via not-too-busy roads, and notable car-free pathways exist from downtown to and beyond the western city limit.  The primary off-street bicycle and pedestrian path system is the Prince Memorial Greenway, extending along the banks of Santa Rosa Creek from City Hall in the heart of downtown, out beyond the city to the west.  On the western edge of downtown, near the Marriott Hotel in Railroad Square, this connects to the Joe Rodota Trail, a paved off-street path going to Sebastapol paralleling CA highway 12.  Much of the city is relatively flat.\n\nThe downtown core is easily walkable, and if one were staying downtown they could conceivably while away a day on foot.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Schulz Museum.JPG"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Schulz Museum"]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Charles M.
