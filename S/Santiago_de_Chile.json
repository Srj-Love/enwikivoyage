It is not uncommon to suffer from the heat in shorts and a short-sleeved shirt during the day but require a jacket at night.\n\nSantiago is notorious for its poor air quality, which is due to the inversion effect in the basin and other factors.

Be prepared for sauna-heat on the metro during summer.\n\nBy South American standards Santiago is a safe city, but visitors should be aware of pickpocketing and other petty crimes (Chileans derogatorily refer to the pickpockets as \"lanzas\", \"spears\" in English). Avoid parks at night and don't wear expensive looking jewelry or watches even during the day, unless you are in Las Condes or Vitacura. If you're alone, avoid large crowds of people, especially downtown.\n\nIf you happen to have bad luck and get robbed, do as you're told by the criminal and if you don't understand Spanish, give away the wallet.

Only change your money in legal currency exchange centers, which may take more time but are much more trustworthy. There's one in the airport, but they are also easy to find in the downtown and financial areas, or in the malls.\n\nIf you are going to see a football match, be careful with the \"barras bravas\" who are the most fanatic but also dangerous fans. They are often involved in troubles with the police both inside the stadium and outside. Avoid buying tickets in the sections where the bravas dominate which it often does behind the goals. The middle section is the safest but if you have a friend who wants to support Colo-Colo and another Universidad de Chile for example, avoid showing it. Even if the middle section is safe, showing different shirts can cause you trouble. Either go with the same shirts or dress neutral. Other football matches not being the \"Superclásico\" between Universidad de Chile against Colo-Colo should be pretty safe.\n\nWalking to the stadium you will find people begging for some pesos so they can see the match. Avoid giving them if you want to stay out of trouble.\n\nThe barrio where the Estadio Nacional is located is a place which is normally peaceful, but you have to walk with precaution and keep your eyes on other people when it's crowded. It's better to take a taxi to the arena, or a rental car if you can find a place to park it.\n\nThere are some neighbourhoods\/barrios that should be avoided. The few carabineros and locals that speak English will know which areas are to be avoided since some of them can actually be accessed by metro. Some people at local Starbucks are more likely to speak English.\n\nIf you see fewer tall buildings and more houses with locked windows and entrances, then turn back. The changes happen very slowly, unlike some other Latin American cities, so you'd have to travel quite a lot from a wealthy safe neighbourhood to a dangerous ghetto. Avoid especially La Legüa (not to be confused with La Ligua in the V Región) which is famed in Chile for its high crime rates. Single police cars won't even enter the area.\n\nTry staying away from the following comunas: Lo Espejo, La Pintana, Puente Alto (especially the Plaza de Armas), La Cisterna, San Joaquín, El Bosque (not to be confused with the avenue and neighbourhood located around Metro El Golf, which is in Las Condes), San Ramón and LA Granja unless you know exactly where you're going. Though these places are not completely unsafe for the most part, they can have a few unsafe spots and don't have much touristic significance.\n\nThe safest comunas are Providencia, Vitacura and Las Condes. All of them have lots of local security guards, besides Carabineros, and locals are more likely to speak English, especially young people. They are not completely safe, though: petty theft still takes place, so keep your eyes open in the streets. Lo Barnechea can be tricky as it is the only comuna that has both extremely wealthy and extremely poor neighbourhoods ever since Pinochet's dictatorship; \"La Dehesa\" is wealthy and safe, \"Cerro Dieciocho\" is as dangerous as La Legua.\n\nOverall, Santiago is very safe if you travel by car.\n\nThe metro is regarded as safer for travelling amongst the locals, even though security has increased in the buses after the introduction of TranSantiago. But some locals still prefer using the metro especially when it gets darker, since almost all the stations have guards. Don't expect the staff to speak much English.\n\n",{"type":"''","value":["Never"]}," join a protest because it can end badly. If you were caught in one, don't hesitate to hide in a restaurant, shop or something similar.\n\nIn any situation, you can trust the Chilean Police (Carabineros). Although you can hardly find one who can speak English, they will try to answer your questions, solve your problems or give you orientations.
