Guides show the way (the way is partly marked, but the marks are not frequent), tell about the local way of living along with the nature (healing plants included) and local customs. The best guides take Bs150 for a day and the money is well-spent. To visit naturally unique protected Tucabaca valley on foot you need 2-3 days, but if motorized (more than Bs400) a day is enough. Pozos are unique: a river cascade falls over a stone drilling a dish there (up to the certain depth, until impossible to drill deeper), filling it with water that drips out to drill the next dish just below it. This way, there are some 5-7 interconnected dishes of different size and depth (i.e. 7 meters) one below the orher. It is a sheer bliss to swim in these or jump right into the middle of a big one. The most water and greenery is in December. The animals and birds activate to hunt in the evening, so you can manage to see parrots, monkeys, eastern condors on the way."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nThe hotel at the main square serves breakfast which is a little expensive (Bs25), but big.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Church convent serving as guesthouse"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=At the main square"],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=Single Bs50"],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nReturn back to Roboré (i.e. the way you came in) and continue west (Santa Cruz, Jesuit Missions) or east (Puerto Quijarro, Brazil) from there.
