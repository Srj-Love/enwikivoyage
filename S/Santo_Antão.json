When you land at the ferry port it appears to be dusty and sandy like many of the other islands but in half an hour you can be driving up steep, windy roads and suddenly find yourself in pine forest and skimming the edge of a volcano!  Much of the island is unexplored, but the best part to head for is the north east corner where there is great hiking.  In Ponto do Sol you can scuba dive, hike or rock climb in a very picturesque setting.  Accommodation is inexpensive and would suit all budgets. Santo Antao is the most northern and the most western island of the archipelago, with the area of 779 km², maximum length of 43 km and maximum width of 24 km. The highest point is Topo de Coroa, 1,979 m high.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nYou cannot get to Santo Antão by plane.
