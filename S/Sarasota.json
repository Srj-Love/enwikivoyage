It is known for its vibrant arts community, excellent restaurants, unique shopping, and beautiful beaches.  Sarasota, although a mid-sized city, is considered to be the cultural center of West Central Florida.  The city has a metropolitan flavor unique to cities of its size and to cities in Florida.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nThe Asolo Theater, Florida West Coast Symphony, Sarasota Opera, the Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall, and frequent art shows add to the cultural theme of the city, rivaling the facilities of Florida's largest cities.  Sarasota is also home to the Ringling Museum of Art, the Selby Botanical Gardens, New College (Florida's public honors college), a USF branch, and the Ringling School of Art and Design.\n\nSarasota's downtown comprises a true urban cityscape with offices and several upscale downtown condominiums.  It is complemented by ",{"type":"'''","value":["Saint Armands Circle"]},", on Saint Armands Key, which is surrounded by Lido Key, across Sarasota Bay from downtown via the Ringling Causeway (with sweeping views of Sarasota Bay.)  Saint Armands Circle is an upscale outdoor shopping area, with several cafes, reminiscent of Europe.  The idea for Saint Armands was from John Ringling who also intended to build a Ritz hotel on Longboat Key.  Today, Sarasota has a Ritz hotel downtown as well as the Longboat Key Club on Ringling's original site.  The Longboat Key Club includes two golf courses, tennis, and all other resort facilities and is located just north of Saint Armands on Longboat Key.\n\nThe beaches are a major draw to the area.  Siesta Key Beach is consistently ranked among the most beautiful beaches on Earth.  (Siesta Key was also the site chosen for the marriage of Chrissy and Brian, of Home Today fame.)  Crescent Beach, Turtle Beach, Lido Beach, and the beach running the 15 mile span of Longboat Key are equally beautiful and accessible.  Indeed, much of Sarasota's charm comes from the fact that the beaches are so plentiful and accessible.  \n\nSarasota beaches are the Winner of the \"Worlds finest, whitest sand,\"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.srq-airport.com\/ Sarasota\/Bradenton International Airport"]}]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["SRQ"]]},"), 6000 Airport Circle, +1 941 359-2777, is on the border between Sarasota and Manatee counties, 3.5 mi (6 km) north of downtown Sarasota."]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["Sarasota has one primary expressway, ",{"type":"'''","value":["Interstate 75"]},", which runs north to south."]},{"type":"*","value":["The major roads within Sarasota include the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Tamiami Trail"]}," (which is the name given to US 41 between Tampa and Miami), ",{"type":"'''","value":["US Route 301"]},", Beneva Rd., Tuttle Ave\/Swift Rd., Honore Avenue and Cattleman Rd., all running north-to-south, and Clark Rd., Proctor Rd., Bee Ridge Rd., Fruitville Rd. and University Pkwy., all running east-to-west."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe city includes the mainland downtown as well as three islands, called \"keys.\"  These are Longboat Key, Lido Key, and Siesta Key.

These artists also helped to generate the aesthetic standard in a world that had never before known photographs. Untethered by convention, they were free to develop their own vision, bound only by the dimensions of their camera's negative. Viewing these images now, we are privileged to experience through their eyes some of those magical initial moments when West encountered East. By producing images of uncommon beauty and depicting what was foreign with pathos, these photographers elevated what could have been a mundane record to an enduring artistic accomplishment. In their photographs, the incidental becomes consequential; and the commonplace, significant. And where we might have seen caricature, instead an individual meets our eye. These exceptional artists traveled to the other side of the globe in search of the unique.

However vigilance is required if traveling through Newtown at night.\n\nThere is a nice downtown park at the Five Points intersection of Main Street,Pineapple and Central Avenues. Some homeless people congregate there but there is a city ordinance against panhandling and sleeping outdoors.\n\nThe northern end of Tamiami Trail near University Parkway is also known for run-down motels and some prostitution arrests.
