Originally a hunting preserve of the erstwhile Alwar state, the area was declared a wildlife reserve in 1955. In 1978, it was given the status of a tiger reserve making it a part of India's Project Tiger scheme. The present area of the park is 866 kmÂ². The park is situated 107 km from Jaipur and 200 km from Delhi.[1]\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nThere is an ancient isolated fort in the forest reserve. This fort is said to be built by Aurangzeb to imprison his elder borther Dara Shekoh. The fort is called Kankarwari. The fort is not well maintained but the views are nice and provide breathtaking panaromic view of the valley. It is a steep climb to the top of a hill where the fort is built. \n\nThere are the ruins of a temple complex where excavations are still occurring and one of the prominent temples is the \nPandupol temple and not the Neelkantha temple, as some people mistake it to be. Legends say that at Pandupol Bhim was tested by Lord Hanuman for strength and humility. The ruins date back to a period between 6th and 13th century. The broken yet noble statues lying littered on the grounds tantalisingly tease and will not yield their secrets easily. It is a fascinating place for those that have a passion for romance with the past.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\nSome of the wildlife found in the Sariska Tiger Reserve include the Bengal tiger, leopard, jungle cat, hyena, jackal, chital, sambar, caracal, langur, wild boar, four-horned deer (chowsingha) and several species of birds. The reserve's tiger population nearly disappeared in 2005, however after sustained efforts by Wildlife Institute of India (WII) and state government of Rajasthan, the crisis was averted. There are no Tigers, currently (2008). However the forests do have Deer - Sambar, Monkeys and Nilgay.\n\nThree tigers were relocated in Sariska from Ranthombor tiger reserve in 2008 & 2009.

The 17th-century Kankwadi fort, located near the center of the park, was where the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb briefly imprisoned his brother Dara Shikoh in the battle for succession of the Mughal throne. The area also has historical buildings associated with the Maharajas of Alwar such as the Sariska Palace, which was used as a royal hunting lodge of Maharaja Jai Singh.\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nOn the way back to Alwar from Sariska, do make it a point to visit Siliserh RTDC hotel Lake palace.
