Harbour hill is quite steep, so it may be worth paying the £1 fare to take a \"toastrack\" (one of two specially constructed passenger trailers towed by one of the 31 ubiquitous tractors) up. If your baggage is labelled (including hotel name), the hotels and ferry companies organise a \"carter\" (their dedicated driver of a tractor and trailer) to deliver your bags on arrival and departure.\n\nThe other means of transport available are horse-drawn vans. They usually depart from the top of Harbour Hill. They cost about £20 for an hour's drive around Sark, or £15 for a single trip to Little Sark. Prices are per person. The driver will also act as tour guide, and some will speak French.\n\nThere are also a couple of cycle-hire shops on Sark. Note that you may want to book before you arrive on the island, particularly in the summer. Also, cycling is illegal on La Coupée and down Harbour Hill. Finally, horses always have right of way on Sark, be careful as they can be surprisingly quiet, even when drawing a cart, so you may not hear it arrive. Also, the driver's control of a horse is not absolute.\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/atobcycles.sarkpost.com\/ A to B Cycles"]}]},", bookings@atobcycles.com, +44 1481 832844.
