The road conditions are good because there were several modernization projects financed in order to improve the main road connections. (but you can still expect some places were roadworks are still in progress - specially in the north \/ north-eastern part of the county) \nIt is also very easy to enter the county from Hungary (via Csenger-Petea border crossing). Because Romania is a EU country scheduled to join the Schengen area you will only need to show your passport or your ID at the border (usually it will take no more than 5 minutes as there is only a single checkpoint).\nOn the other hand, if you plan to enter the county (and in the same time Romania) from Ukraine the story is a bit different. Expect waiting times for up to 3-4 hours (august 2011) or even more when shift change. This is mainly due to the Ukrainian side, where border guards don't seem to be stressed at all, barely speak any other language than Ukrainian or Russian, and let cars to pass one by one every 20 minutes or so.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Administrative Palace, tallest building in Romania"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Chain Church"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Capitoline Wolf statue"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Decebal Street synagogue"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Garden of Rome"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Restaurant Loren's"],["url="],["email="],["address=Strada Grigore Alexandrescu 20, Szatmárnémeti"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+40 374 019 355"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Restaurant Loren is a good option in the center."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nThere are several good hotels in Satu Mare, both in the center of the town as well as at some distance to the center.\n\nIn the central area you will find: Hotel Astoria, Hotel Dana 2, Hotel Poesis and Hotel Aurora.\n\nGood and clean hotels at quite good prices outside of the central area are: Hotel Satu Mare City, Motel Select, Hotel Dana and Hotel Coral.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Maramureș"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Satu Mare"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Satu Mare"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["47.79"],["22.89"]]}]
