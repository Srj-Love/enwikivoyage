The family were sheikhs of Nejd, the area around Riyadh, but were driven out by a neighbouring dynasty, hiding with their relatives, the emirs of Kuwait. Then in 1902, young Abd al-Aziz Ibn Saud and a few dozen lads rode out to raid their home territory. As it turned out, the invaders had been ruling badly, so many locals joined them. They not only re-captured Riyadh, but much of the surrounding territory.\n\nAfter that, Abdul Aziz set out on a 30-year campaign to unify the Arabian Peninsula. The area united under him became known as Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn the 1930s, the discovery of oil transformed the country. Following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, Saudi Arabia accepted the Kuwaiti royal family and 400,000 refugees while allowing Western and Arab troops to deploy on its sand for the liberation of Kuwait the following year. A burgeoning population, unemployment, aquifer depletion, and an economy largely dependent on petroleum output and prices are all major governmental concerns.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Economy"]},"\nSaudi Arabia is an oil-based economy with strong government controls over major economic activities. Saudi Arabia has the largest reserves of petroleum in the world (26% of the proven reserves), ranks as the largest exporter of petroleum, and plays a leading role in OPEC. The petroleum sector accounts for roughly 75% of budget revenues, 45% of GDP, and 90% of export earnings. About 25% of GDP comes from the private sector. \n\nRoughly 4 million foreign workers play an important role in the Saudi economy - for example, in the oil and service sectors. \n\nIn 1999 the government announced plans to begin privatizing the electricity companies, which follows the ongoing privatization of the telecommunications company. The government is expected to continue calling for private sector growth to lessen the kingdom's dependence on oil and increase employment opportunities for the swelling Saudi population. Shortages of water and rapid population growth will constrain government efforts to increase self-sufficiency in agricultural products.\n\nUnemployment among young Saudis is a serious problem. While part of this can be explained by Saudi reluctance to take many types of work, it is also true that Saudi citizens are forced to compete with multitudes of imported labor, which is often much cheaper than that of the locals.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Geography"]},"\n; ",{"type":"'''","value":["Terrain"]}," :\nSaudi Arabia covers approximately four fifths of the area of the Arabian Peninsula, which can be described as a rectangular plateau gradually sloping eastwards till reaching sea level at the Persian Gulf.\n\nThe main topographical features are as follows:\n\nThe Sarawat or Sarat mountain range runs parallel to the Red Sea coast beginning near the Jordanian border until the southern coast of Yemen, gradually increasing in height southwards.  It is largely made up of barren volcanic rock, especially in the south, and sandstone in the north, but it is also interspersed with ancient lava fields and fertile valleys.  As one moves further south towards Yemen, the barren landscape gradually gives way to green mountains and even woodlands, the result of being in the range of the monsoons.  In Saudi Arabia, the range is commonly known as the Hejaz, though the southernmost part of the range is known as 'Aseer.  In the foothills of the Hejaz lies the holy city of Makkah, and approximately 400 km north of Makkah in an oasis between two large lava fields lies the other holy city of Madinah.\n\nWest of the Sarawat or Hejaz mountain range is a narrow coastal plain known as Tihama, in which the country's second largest city, Jidda, is located.\n\nEast of the Hejaz lies the elevated plateau known as Najd, a sparsely populated area of desert steppe dotted with small volcanic mountains.  To the east of Najd-proper lies the Tuwaig escarpment, a narrow platau running 800 km from north to south.  Its top layer is made of limestone and bottom layer of sandstone.  Historically rich in fresh groundwater and criscrossed with numerous dry riverbeds (wadis), the Tuwaig range and its immediate vicinity are dotted with a constellation of towns and villages.  In the middle, nestled between a group of wadis, is the capital city, Ar-Riyadh.\n\nFurther east from the Tuwaig plataeu and parallel to it is a narrow (20-100 km) corridor of red sand dunes known as the Dahana desert, which separates the \"Central Region\" or \"Najd\" from the Eastern Province.  The heavy presence of iron oxides gives the sand its distinctive red appearance.  The Dahana desert connects two large \"seas\" of sand dunes.  The northern one is known as the Nufuud, approximately the size of Lake Superior, and the southern is known as \"the Empty Quarter,\" so-called because it covers a quarter of the area of the Peninsula.  Though essentially uninhabitable, the edges of these three \"seas of sand\" make for excellent pastures in the spring season, but even the bedouin almost never attempted to cross the Empty Quarter.\n\nNorth of the Nufud desert lies a vaste desert steppe, traditionally populated mainly by nomadic bedouins with the exception of a few oasis such as Al-Jof.  This region is an extension of the Iraqi and Syrian deserts (or vice versa).  After a rainy season, these barren, rocky steppes can yield lush meadows and rich pastures.\n\nThe eastern province is largely barren except that it contains two oases resulting from springs of ancient fossil water.  These are the oases of Al-Qateef on the Gulf coast and Al-Hasa (or Al-Ahsa) further inland. Next to Qatif lies the modern metropolitan area of Dammam, Dhahran and Al-Khobar.\n\n; ",{"type":"'''","value":["Elevation extremes"]}," : ",{"type":"''","value":["lowest point:"]}," Persian Gulf 0 m (0 ft)",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},{"type":"''","value":["highest point:"]}," Jabal Sawda' 3,133 m (10,279 ft)\n; ",{"type":"'''","value":["Natural resources"]}," : petroleum, natural gas, iron ore, gold, copper\n; ",{"type":"'''","value":["Land use"]}," : ",{"type":"''","value":["arable land:"]}," 1.72% ",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},{"type":"''","value":["permanent crops:"]}," 0.06% ",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},{"type":"''","value":["other:"]}," 98.22% (1998 est.)\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:The Kaaba - Flickr - Al Jazeera English.jpg"],["thumb"],["270px"],["The Kaaba in Mecca"]]},"\nPeople tend to think of Saudi Arabia as an expanse of ",{"type":"'''","value":["scorchingly hot desert"]}," punctuated with oil wells, and for most of the time in most of the country, they would be absolutely right.

In July and August, in particular, all who can flee the country and work slows down to a crawl.  The coasts are only slightly moderated by the sea, which usually keeps temperatures below 38°C — but at the price of extreme humidity (85-100%), which many find even more uncomfortable than the dry heat of the interior, especially at night.

The winter can also bring rains to all or most of the country, although in many years this is limited to one or two torrential outbursts.  The end of spring (April and May) is also a rainy season for much of the country.

Some better hotels will be able to quietly supply room service during the day, but otherwise you'll have to do your preparations.  All restaurants in the Kingdom are closed during the day, and while some offices stay open with limited hours, the pace of business slows down to a torpor.  After evening prayer, though, all the restaurants in the bazaar open up and do a roaring trade until the small hours of the morning. Most of the shops are open as well, and the cool of the evening makes it a pleasant time to shop.

Most short-term Western visitors to Saudi arrive on business visas, which require an invitation from a local sponsor which has been approved by the Saudi Chamber of Commerce.  Once this invitation is secured and certified, the actual process of issuing the visa is relatively fast and painless, taking anything from one day to two weeks.  Word has it that the \"new visas\" (electronically generated) are only available through agencies within your country of residence.

English is unlikely to be spoken by the police, even in big cities, so try to use the waiting time to arrange a translator.  The police will issue an accident report, which you have to take to the traffic police station and get it stamped a few times in different queues (this takes most of a morning). Only then can any damage to the car be repaired, as insurance companies will not pay for any body work without this report.\n\nIt is not uncommon for the traffic police to resolve the incident there and then by determining the guilty party and deciding compensation. So, should it be your fault the Police will ask you to pay an amount to the other party - but you are not obligated to do so.\n\nAt the present time, access to car rentals is limited to males 21 and older.

Most tourist cities (i.e. Makkah, Madinah, Taif, Al Abha) will also have very affordable and spacious shigka-maafroosha (short-term furnished rental apartments). Shigka-maafroosha owners generally loiter in hotel lobbies. Often, they will approach civilized-looking people (generally families) and make an offer. Prices for shigka-mafrooshas and small hotels are always negotiable to a great degree. Smaller hotels will only accept cash, normally in advance.\n\nLarger, more expensive hotels are abundant in all major cities.  After the lull caused by the insurgency in 2003, prices have been rising again, and you can expect to pay north of US$200 for a weekday night at a good hotel in any of the big Saudi cities.  In exchange, you usually get excellent service and the ability to work around some restrictions (e.g. restaurants that stay open through prayer hours and daytime room service during Ramadan).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\nThere are no major health risks for traveling in Saudi Arabia: water is generally drinkable and food is usually, but not always, hygienic.

Private hospitals are often run with the participation of foreign partners. These facilities range from fairly rudimentary to very advanced and very expensive.

Then to get an exit visa, you need your sponsor's signature. This can lead to major problems.  ESL teachers can find work in Saudi Arabia with a Bachelor`s Degree and a TESOL certification.  ESL teachers in Saudi Arabia can expect to earn 8,000 - 13,000 SAR (monthly) and will usually teach 20 – 30 hours in a week. Contracts will usually include accommodations, airfare, and health care.

The wave of violence in 2003-2004 has been squashed by a brutal crackdown by Saudi security forces and there have been no major attacks in the cities for several years, security remains tight and it is prudent not to draw too much attention to yourself. Foreigners should register their presence with their embassy or consulate. Emergency alert systems using e-mail and cell phone messages are maintained by many governments for their guest workers.\n\nFour French tourists, part of a larger group that had been camping in the desert, were shot and killed by terrorists near Madain Saleh in early 2007.  Due to this, mandatory police escorts — which can be an interesting experience, but can also be annoying, restrictive hassles — are sometimes provided for travel outside major cities, in areas like Abha, Najran and Madain Saleh.\n\nWhile Saudi Arabia has one of the ",{"type":"''","value":["lowest crime rates in the world"]},", a certain background level of non-violent opportunistic theft like pickpocketing and purse snatching does exist.

It is common for Saudi men to walk hand in hand as a sign of friendship (or more), but it would be unwise for Western men to attempt the same.  Sharing a hotel room as a way of cutting costs is normal, but  don't even think about asking for one bed for two.

In theory, women may not even be driven by unrelated people (e.g. taxi drivers), although this is widely ignored and rarely enforced.\n\nA woman ",{"type":"''","value":["may"]}," travel alone.  They may also stay alone in hotels, although hotels may require written permission on check-in unless the woman holds an official form of ID.\n\nWhile all this legally applies to foreign women as well, in practice foreign women are not restrained by their families in the way that Saudi women are, and can have considerable leeway if they choose to take it.  For example, a foreign woman and her boyfriend (or even male coworker) can simply ",{"type":"''","value":["claim to be"]}," husband and wife, and thus mingle freely — although, if caught doing so, they could sometimes be subject to a short stay in jail.\n\nA single woman accosted by the police or the ",{"type":"''","value":["muttawa"]}," and requested to come with them ",{"type":"'''","value":["does not have to"]}," (and, for their own safety, should not) go with them alone: you have the right to call your ",{"type":"''","value":["mahram"]}," and have them arrive, and you should use it.  However, you may be required to surrender your ID, and you may not leave until the police\/muttawa allow you to.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Other"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Photography"]}," is probably the easiest way for a visitor to inadvertently get into trouble.  Do ",{"type":"''","value":["not"]}," take pictures of any government-related building (ministries, airports, military facilities etc.) or any building that could possibly be one, or you risk being hauled off to jail for espionage.  As strict Wahhabi belief prohibits making images of any living creature and Saudis place a high value on privacy, do not photograph any Saudi men without permission and do ",{"type":"''","value":["not"]}," even point your camera in the general direction of women, period.  Even government publications avoid pictures of people and often resort to mosaicing out faces if they have to use one!\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Playing music in public"]}," is also prohibited (though this does not include playing music at a picnic in the desert for example).  However, personal music players and listening to music in private is fine, and there are plenty of music shops in the country's shopping malls if you don't mind permanent marker over Britney's hemline on the cover. It is not uncommon to hear young Saudis blasting the latest hip-hop music in their vehicles, at least when the muttawa are not around.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Religious items for religions other than Islam"]},", including Bibles, crucifixes and any religious literature, are technically forbidden, although these days items for personal use are generally ignored.  However, anything that hints of proselytism is treated ",{"type":"'''","value":["very"]}," harshly, and the muttawa often bust illicit church assemblies and the like.  Public observance of religions other than Islam is technically a crime in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe flag of Saudi Arabia bears the Islamic declaration of faith, and desecration or any other inappropriate use of the flag is considered insulting.  Public criticism of the King, the royal family or Saudi Arabia's government in general is not tolerated.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By phone"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["infobox"],["Useful numbers"],["* Police: 999\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Car Accidents: 993"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Ambulance: 997"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Fire: 998"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Phone Directory (Fees Apply): 905"]}]]},"\n\nThe three mobile operators in Saudi, incumbent ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.stc.com.sa Al Jawal"]}]},", Emirati rival ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.mobily.com.sa\/ Mobily"]}]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kuwait"],["Kuwaiti"]]}," newcomer ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.sa.zain.com\/ Zain"]}]}," (Vodafone Network) are fiercely competitive, with good coverage (in populated areas) and good pricing.  A starter pack with prepaid SIM and talktime starts from about SR 75, and you can sign up in most any larger mobile shop (bring your passport).  Local calls are under SR 0.5\/minute, while calls overseas are around or less than SR 2\/min.\n\nAnd yes, you can bring in your own phone: despite grumblings from the clerics, both camera phones and multimedia messaging (MMS) are now legal.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By net"]},"\nInternet cafes abound in major Saudi cities, and many shopping malls feature a gaming parlor or two.  Rates are around SR5\/hour.\n\nWhile Internet in Saudi Arabia is cordoned off by a filter, it aims primarily at pornography, non-Islamic religious and domestic political sites in Arabic, and (from the traveller's point of view) is nowhere near as strict as, say, China's.  Google, Skype, Wikipedia, all major webmail providers etc. are all accessible.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By mail"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.sp.com.sa\/SaudiPost\/English\/ Saudi Post"]}]}," has a good network of post offices around the country, but offices are closed Thursday and Friday.

Your best bet is thus gift shops in major hotels. Mail coming in to the country from overseas is notoriously unreliable. Stories abound of thing arriving months after they were sent or never arriving at all.
