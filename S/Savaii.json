It is certainly less developed, with no real towns as such, just a series of small villages with people living in traditional huts. You don't have to worry about getting lost on Savaii if you're driving - only one (well-paved) road runs around the island. Every few miles you will likely pass a colonial style church, while the coastline will regularly change between volcanic black ash, pristine white sand beaches, and dramatic cliffs.\n\nOverall, visit Savai'i if you want a more authentic and unspoiled Samoan experience away from the Internet cafes and McDonalds of Apia.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Samoa ferry Fotu o Samoa II.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["right"],["The ferry between Upolu and Savaii at Salelologa"]]},"\n\nEnglish is widely understood, but it doesn't hurt to know a few ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Samoan phrasebook"],["Samoan"]]}," phrases.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nMost people reach Savaii by small car ferry. The only alternatives are sailing there yourself or chartering a flight from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Apia"]]}," to one of Savaii's two airfields (there are usually no scheduled flights although at the end of 2010 Polynesian Airlines was operating two flights a week from Fagalii Airport close to Apia). The ferry journey takes 1 hour 15 minutes from Mulifanua Port (towards the most western edge of Upolu) to Salelologa on the southeast of Savaii. There are a maximum of five sailings a day, usually every 2 hours with the first at 06.00 and the last at 16.00. The ferry schedule can be found here ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.samoashipping.com\/domesticsailing_schedule.htm"]},". Price for foot passengers is SAT12.00.\n\nWhile no recent accidents have been reported, it should be noted that several government travel warnings have been issued about the safety of this ferry - relating specifically to overloading, and the threat of heavy vehicles moving during the voyage. In reality though, it is the only feasible way to reach Savaii, and so the final decision is up to you.\n\nIf you do decide to use it, it's very likely that you'll be one of the few foreigners on board. Locals are therefore likely to strike up a conversation. Don't be concerned - this is almost always innocent and driven purely by curiosity.\n\nIf you are planning a short excursion to Savai'i then it's better to pack a small overnight bag and leave your main suitcase back at the Travellers Lounge in Apia. Dragging your suitcase onto the ferry and around Savai'i could be rather awkward.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Bus"]},"\nThe main means of getting around in Savaii are the brightly colored, pop-music blaring local buses. A one-way fare costs a maximum of WS$7 if you head to the northwest, with closer destinations being much less. The fare is paid to the driver at the end of the journey. Most buses depart from the markets in Salelologa. There are also some buses which meet the ferry at the Salelologa wharf. Buses in Savai'i tend to fill up quickly and you might find yourself sitting on the lap of a local! This is quite an experience for westerners.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Taxi"]},"\nGenerally your best bet. They are cheap and plentiful. Do agree on a price ahead of time, none of the taxis have meters!\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Car Rental"]},"\nYou need to obtain a local license which is very easy to get from the Transport Control Board at the police station in Apia (international licenses are not accepted) or from just next to the exit from customs at the airport. Some car rental companies also provide this service. Licence endorsement costs SAT12. Renting a car is possible but not economical unless you will be driving it a lot every day. They are particularly handy if you plan to visit the Falealupo peninsular, which does not have good public transport. Car hire companies include: PK Rentals (pkrentals@samoa.ws); Salafi (apia_lua@ipasifiki.net) and Savaii Car Rentals (cars@lesamoa.net).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Cycling"]},"\nPossible and quite enjoyable.
