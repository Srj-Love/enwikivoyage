It is on the Mekong River. With an estimated population of 120,000 it is the second largest city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Laos"]]},". The city is the hub between west (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mukdahan"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Thailand"]]},") and east (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vietnam"]]},"), and between north (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vientiane"]]},") and south (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pakse"]]},"). \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nTravellers visiting Savannakhet are often surprised by its old French colonial architecture and the friendly, sleepy atmosphere of the town which conserves many aspects of Lao traditional culture. The small but blossoming tourist sector offers various eco-trekking programs to the outskirts of town and to preserved forests and other places of interest in neighbouring districts such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Champhone"]]},"). The welcoming and generous character of the local people might give you the sincere feeling of being happy to be a family member, very unlike the commercial character of tourist destinations such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vang Vieng"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Si Phan Don"]]},". Although recently a casino was established, Savannakhet has no night-life scene, which probably is the main reason why Savannakhet is not popular as a tourist destination among Western travellers.\n\nThe last two decades, dinosaurs have become a main theme of Savannakhet. The Dinosaur Museum and decorations in the streets reflect the history. Long after dinosaurs had left their last footprints, Savannakhet probably was founded in the 17th century by forty families who immigrated from Phonsim village (around 20 km to the east of town). It is said that the settlement at the Mekong riverside was called Tahae village and researchers assume that Buddhist temple Vat Xaiyaphoum is an important remainder of that era.\n\nFrance expanded Indochina by obtaining the east bank of the Mekong after a border dispute in 1893. Initially The French used the Mekong River as the main artery of transport. Not many years later, a network of water transportation, post, and telecommunication facilities and a railway were completed. Also a road, connecting Savannakhet with Quang Tri (Vietnam), was built. In the 1920s and 1930s Vietnamese and Chinese started to settle in Savannakhet. Nowadays, the Chinese and Vietnamese still live in the same parts of the city, while other parts are still redolent of the French administration that was centred in the south part of town. \n\nRecently an important chapter was added to the history of Savannakhet. The 1,600 m Lao-Thai Friendship Bridge II was opened in January 2007. The bridge connects Savannakhet (and Vietnam) to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mukdahan"]]}," (Thailand). This bridge strengthens the reputation of Savannakhet as open for business.
