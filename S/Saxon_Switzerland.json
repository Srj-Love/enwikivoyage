Bizarre stone formations and spectacular views are only a few characteristics of this region that is ideal for hiking, but also for a relaxed day out. For those who like nature, it is surely the most beautiful landscape in Saxony. It can get crowded along the river at summer weekends, if you don't like this, try the colder days. In late autumn or even winter you will nearly be alone outside the villages. There are also many rock castles and caves within the region, most worth a visit. Further up stream along the Elbe\/Labe one enters the Czech Republic. However, the rock formations and the natural spender continue and this region is known historically as the Bohemian Switzerland or \"Böhmische Schweiz\" in German.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pirna"]]}," - a bigger historically industrial town, called the gate to Saxon Switzerland "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bad Gottleuba - Berggießhübel"]]}," a well known cure spa close to Saxon Switzerland"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bad Schandau"]]}," - on the river within Saxon Switzerland"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Heidenau"]]}," - former chemical industrial town between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dresden"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pirna"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Königstein"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sebnitz"]]}," - bigger Saxon province town in Saxon Switzerland"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Rathen"]]}," and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bastei"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":["The castle of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Stolpen"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Königstein"],["Königstein Fortress"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":["The castle of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Weesenstein"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:SaechsischeSchweiz01.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Typical sandstone formation in the Saxon Switzerland"]]},"\nThe mountain range was created after the sea retreated and left sandstone as the remains.
