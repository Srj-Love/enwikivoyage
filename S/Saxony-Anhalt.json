It is merged from some former Prussian territories around Magdeburg in the northern and western parts, the former duchy of Anhalt in the central part, and old Saxon territories, which came to Prussia as a result of the Vienna Congress in 1815, around Halle and Wittenberg in the eastern and southern parts. Therefore Saxony-Anhalt lacks a centralized structure (the capital Magdeburg not being the largest city) and many important sites are scattered around the state.\n\nShowing some of the most fertile soils in Germany, the find of the Nebra Sky Disk, an astronomical masterpiece of the Bronze Age, shows that the area was well inhabited already in early times by a sophisticated culture. Later, during medieval times this area was a core area of the growing Holy Roman Empire with many witnesses of that time like the Romanesque cathedrals in Magdeburg, Naumburg, Merseburg and Halberstadt, the city of Quedlinburg, the castle of Querfurt and numerous monasteries. From Wittenberg the Protestant reformation spread around the world after Martin Luther published his 95 theses at the door of the Wittenberg Schlosskirche. The ruling family of the duchy of Anhalt, formerly an independent territory within Germany, did its share of networking to European monarchies. Roots of the Dutch kings are at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Oranienbaum"]]},", a princess from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zerbst"]]}," married to the Russian court and became Russian tsarina as Catharine the Great. Later the city of Dessau and its surroundings emerged as a major hotspot of European enlightenment under prince Leopold III. Friedrich Franz, who created the Dessau-Wörlitz Garden realm. The area around ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mansfeld"]]}," has several hundred years of continuous history of mining on copper and other metals. Industrial inventions include the metal airplane by Hugo Junkers and the colour film at the Agfa-works in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wolfen"]]},". \n\nNowadays Saxony-Anhalt shows a massive decline in population as a result of the economic changes in East Germany since unification, leaving suburbs in many cities derelict. Handling shrinking cities is a challenge in urban planning in its own right and there are some examples shown by the international building exhibit 2010. Generally, the state massively undersells its historic and touristic potential, which gives room to many discoveries of hidden treasures.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nLanguage of communication is, not surprisingly, German. Though not as strong as in Saxony or in Bavaria, regional dialects do occur. Roughly along a line from Harz–Wittenberg and along the Elbe, there is a change of dialects, with central German dialects to the south and north-eastern German dialects to the north (\"ich–ick(e)–line\"). \n\nAs learning English was not compulsory in the former GDR, do not expect people who went to school before 1990 to speak or understand English, whereas younger people should at least understand some basics. Russian may be understood by the elderly, as this was taught in East Germany.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nThere is only one minor airport within the state, Magdeburg-Cochstedt (CSO), which has only some seasonal flights to some warm water destinations. Saxony-Anhalt shares the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Leipzig-Halle Airport (LEJ)"]}," with Saxony, which has connections to most other German and some European destinations. LEJ has train connection to Leipzig and Halle with interchanges to nearly all areas of the state from there.\n\nAlso within reasonable distance (approx. 2 hours) are the airports of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hanover (HAJ)"]}," and the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Berlin airports Tegel (TXL) and Schönefeld (SXF)"]},", eventually to be replaced by the new Berlin Airport BER some day in the future. Of those airports, Tegel has the widest choice of international destinations. \n\nThe main hubs in Germany, Frankfurt (FRA) or Munich (MUC) are about four to five hours away.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nCentrally located within Germany, Saxony-Anhalt has a variety of train connections. There are the east-to-west-corridors: the high-speed-line Berlin–",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wolfsburg"]]},"–Hanover, used by ICE-trains, some of them calling at ",{"type":"'''","value":["Stendal"]},", the trunk line Berlin–",{"type":"[[","value":[["Potsdam"]]},"–",{"type":"'''","value":["Magdeburg"]},"–",{"type":"[[","value":[["Braunschweig"]]},"–Kassel\/Hanover, used by all kinds of trains and the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Halle"]},"–",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kassel"]]},"\/",{"type":"[[","value":[["Göttingen"]]}," line (regional trains only).\n\nNorth-south there is the main line Berlin–",{"type":"'''","value":["Wittenberg"]},"–(Leipzig)–",{"type":"'''","value":["Naumburg"]},"–",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nuremberg"]]},"\/",{"type":"[[","value":[["Frankfurt"]]},", served by ICE and IC-trains, some also calling at ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Bitterfeld"]]}]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Halle"]}," and the Leipzig–",{"type":"'''","value":["Halle"]},"–",{"type":"'''","value":["Magdeburg"]},"–",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wittenberge"]]},"–line, which connects at Wittenberge to the sea ports (Hamburg, Rostock).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nLikewise, Saxony-Anhalt is well connected to the German Autobahn-grid. Nearly every traveller to Berlin passes through Saxony-Anhalt. Main Motorway east-west is the A 2 (Berlin–Hanover and beyond), which serves the north. Further south is B 6n, dual-carriageway from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bernburg"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Goslar"]]}," and beyond, extension from Bernburg to Köthen being under construction and the A 38 Halle–Göttingen. In the north-south-direction there is the A 9 (Berlin–Munich), which cuts the eastern and southern parts of Saxony-Anhalt (Dessau, Wittenberg, Halle, Naumburg). The A 14 (Dresden–Magdeburg) runs through central parts of Saxony-Anhalt and the A 71 (Sangerhausen–(Erfurt)–Schweinfurt), once completed, will connect to Thuringia and northern Bavaria, the last 20 km between Sangerhausen and Erfurt still missing.\n\nOf course, there are plenty of minor roads connecting to any direction.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\nThere are no scheduled boat transfers to Saxony-Anhalt. However, some river cruises use the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Elbe"]]}," when cruising Hamburg–Dresden or Potsdam–Prague, usually stopping at Magdeburg, Dessau and Wittenberg.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThere is a dense grid of (mostly) well maintained roads, which serve every spot of the state. Next to the motorways (see ",{"type":"''","value":["get in"]},") are trunk roads (\"Bundesstrassen\", named B xxx). Standard for trunk roads is single carriageway, though there are also some dual carriageway like the newly built B 6n, Bernburg–Ilsenburg and beyond to Goslar, which has motorway-standard. Other trunk roads like B 81 from the A 2 near Magdeburg towards the Harz, the B 100 from the A 9 near Bitterfeld to Halle and continuing eastwards as B 80 and southwards as B 91 are dual carriageway, but not grade separated and not necessarily bypassing villages. Newly built trunk roads are bypassing at least smaller places. \n\nSome minor roads may still have cobblestone surface or even dirt shoulders. Also there still can be surfaces of slag pavers. Be careful, the can become ",{"type":"''","value":["very"]}," slippery, when wet.\n\nThere are not many bridges crossing the Elbe river (only at Wittenberg, Dessau, Schönebeck, Magdeburg and Tangermünde) and the Saale downriver from Halle, but ferries roughly every 20 km of river length. Ferries may not operate during high water levels, some shut down in winter and they do not have 24\/7 service. Usual operating times are from 6 am to 8 pm weekdays, with shorter times (or even no service) on weekends and holidays. Some ferries are on diesel, others are reaction ferries with a cable firmly attached in the river bed and using the current of the river for movement. The reaction ferries, making no noise but the water bubbling underneath them, are a sight by their own right. However, plan carefully, as there might be a long detour waiting, if they are out of operation.\n\nThere are train services thoughout the state to most places of interest. Regional trains operate on an hourly (sometimes two-hourly) basis from approx 5 am to approx 10 pm, sometimes midnight. There are special tariffs for journeys under 50 km on regional trains (\"Hopper ticket\") for 4,50 € flat fare single and 7,50 € return. Also there is the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.bahn.de\/i\/view\/GBR\/en\/prices\/germany\/laender-ticket.shtml ",{"type":"'''","value":["Länder-Ticket Sachsen-Anhalt"]}]}," at 22 € for one person plus 3 € for any additional person up to five. It is valid on any regional and local train plus buses and tramways, which run under an integrated transport authority (like Magdeburg and Halle regions). Saxony-Anhalt-ticket is also valid in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Thuringia"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saxony"]]}," and vice-versa, Saxony-ticket or Thuringia-ticket in Saxony-Anhalt.\n\nSome long-distance cycling tracks run through Saxonxy-Anhalt like the R 1 or the track along the rivers Elbe, Mulde and Saale. Carrying a bike is free on all public transport within Saxony-Anhalt (though not in neighbouring states, so watch out on trains, which cross).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nUNESCO World heritage sites are:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" the medieval city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Quedlinburg"]]},".
