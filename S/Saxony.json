The state has a long history of independence as a kingdom (much like Bavaria), and as a result has a strong sense of self-idenity. It is home to many historic towns and cities and also the eastern German mountain range, the Ore Mountains or \"Erzgebirge\" which it shares with the Czech Republic to the south.

Sorbian is a sister language of Polish and Czech. The Saxon accent is quite strange for most other Germans and therefore often ridiculed and used in comedy. Regardless, the Saxons are very proud of it and it remains a strong part of the region's identity. English is widely spoken and many, especially young people, have a basic knowledge of another foreign language, like French, Spanish or Italian. Russian might be understood by the middle-aged and older Saxons, but with a growing Russian-German community, you might even find a native speaker of the language.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nSaxony has two major airports used for scheduled passenger flights in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dresden"]]}," and between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Leipzig"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Halle"]]},".
