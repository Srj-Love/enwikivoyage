On the 1st floor you can find the check-in desks and Departure Halls 1, 2 and 3. From this floor you can go to passport control and enter the transit area.\n\nThe area after passport control is known as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Schiphol World Avenue"]}," and has four sections: Lounge 1, Lounge 2, Holland Boulevard and Lounge 3. Holland Boulevard is the area's central plaza with a casino and a museum. Gates B-H can be accessed from all of these lounges. Lounge 4 for low-cost carriers is completely separated and only connects with gate M. It has very few facilities.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nSchiphol opened on 16 September 1916 as a military airbase, with a few barracks and a field serving as platform and runways. When civil aircraft started to use the field (17 December 1920), it was often called Schiphol-les-bains. The Fokker aircraft manufacturer started a factory near Schiphol Airport in 1919. Schiphol's name is derived from a former fortification named Fort Schiphol which was part of the Defense Line of Amsterdam. Before 1852, the Haarlemmermeer polder in which the airport lies was a large lake, in the shallow waters of which sudden violent storms could claim many ships. This was the main reason for reclaiming it. In English, Schiphol translates to 'ship grave', a reference to the many ships lost in the area.\n\nKLM was founded on 7 October 1919 by Albert Plesman, making it the oldest carrier in the world still operating under its original name, though the company stopped operating during World War II—apart from the operations in the Dutch Antilles in the Caribbean. The first KLM flight was on 17 May 1920, from Croydon Airport, London to Amsterdam carrying two British journalists and a number of newspapers. In 1921 KLM started scheduled services, and by 1926 it was offering flights to Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Brussels, Paris, London, Bremen, Copenhagen and Malmö. Intercontinental flights to the Netherlands East Indies started in 1929. This was for several years the world's longest scheduled air route.\n\nOn 1 November 1958 the airline opened the trans-polar route from Amsterdam via Anchorage to Tokyo. Each crew flying the transpolar route over the Arctic was equipped with a winter survival kit, including an AR-10 carbine for use against polar bears in the event the plane was forced down onto the polar ice. KLM merged with Air France in May 2004 to form Air France-KLM, but both airlines continue to fly under their distinct brand names.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Flights"]},"\n\nKLM and its partner Delta Air Lines offer worldwide connections. Asia, Europe and North America are particularly well served. British Airways offer up to 15 flights per day to three airports in London. Transavia, Jet2, Easyjet and other low-cost carriers provide a fairly economical way to city-hop to Amsterdam from other cities in Europe.\n\nSchiphol has one giant terminal with all facilities under a single roof radiating from the central plaza (Holland Boulevard). The area is divided into three lounges designated 1, 2 and 3. Gates or concourses are connected to these lounges, but it is possible to walk from one gate to another, even to those connected to different lounges. The exception to this is Lounge 4: it is connected to gate M for low-cost carriers, and once past security, passengers cannot access any other lounges or gates. Lounge 4 has very few facilities.\n\nFew airlines and destinations have a dedicated gate. KLM and Transavia use all gates except H and M.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Lounge 1 consists of gates ",{"type":"'''","value":["B"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["C"]},", dedicated to Schengen areas."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Lounge 2 consists of gates ",{"type":"'''","value":["D"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["E"]},".

Use the ticket machines or ticket desks. Not all machines accept credit or debit cards, and those that do require chip-and-PIN cards. Don't buy the comfort class ticket, buy an single ticket with 'NS only'.\n\nThe train station at Schiphol is located underground, under the main airport hall; trains to Amsterdam Centraal usually run from platform 1 or 2. Note: this is not specific, one is never sure which platform it arrives. Information signs are updated when the train enters the tunnel. It is the same platform, though it matters on which side the train stops. This is why you'll see a lot of locals and tourists waiting just at the end of the escalators or stairs. They eventually go to the right track when it is updated.\n\nThere are 4 to 5 trains per hour between Schiphol and Amsterdam in peak times.
