Its tourist industry has grown as its fishing industry has declined, and it is now a popular summer destination. Despite recent changes, the town retains the character of a small and welcoming fishing community. It is situated at the base of Mount Gabriel and on the north western side of Schull Harbour, a large and sheltered natural cove.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nPart of Schull's charm derives from its remote location. It is however well served by the Bus Eireann 237 route from Cork. The easiest way to explore Schull and the Mizen peninsula is by car, which can be hired from Cork Airport (http:\/\/www.corkairport.com\/gns\/to-from-the-airport\/car-hire.aspx). Schull is about an hour and a half from Cork by car.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nThe town is extremely popular with recreational boaters. The well sheltered and deep natural harbour, coupled with the multiplicity of uninhabited islands to explore makes it an excellent cruising destination. Calves Week is an annual keelboat regatta held in the first week of August which attracts hundreds of visiting and local yachtsmen, as well as spectators. Sailing dinghies are available for hire from Simon Nelson at Schull Watersports (http:\/\/www.schull.ie\/schull_watersport_centre.html). Children's and adults' sailing courses are available from the Fastnet Marine and Outdoor Education Centre (http:\/\/www.schullsailing.ie\/), ranked as the best sailing school in Ireland by the Irish Sailing Association.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Schull"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["West Cork"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["51.883333333333"],["-9.9833333333333"]]}]
