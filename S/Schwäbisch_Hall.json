It therefore has many buildings from the Middle Ages, most intact since after the Thirty Years' War the town declined in power, so the latest buildings in the old town are from the Baroque period, replacing those burned in the last major fire the city had in 1728. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nSchwabisch Hall is two hours from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Frankfurt"]]}," taking the A6 highway, two hours away from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Strasbourg"]]}," via both A5 and A6 roads, one hour away from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Stuttgart"]]}," via A81 and A6 highway, two and a half hours from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Munich"]]}," via A9 and A6, three hours from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zurich"]]}," via A81, four hours from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Prague"]]}," via E50 and A6, and five hours from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Berlin"]]}," via A9. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe old town is split between an upper town, where the town square and St. Michael's Church, and the lower town, by the river, where there is a Biergarten and  more old town, as well as the Wurth Collection. They are connected by medieval stone stairways between buildings. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nIf you go in the summer, you may see theatre in the town square on the steps of St. Michael's Church, or in the temporary Globe Theatre next to the Biergarten. The St. Michael's church is a medieval Lutheran Church in front of the town square, or market square. There is also a medieval fountain to St. George and St. Michael. There is also a municipal museum which explains the history of the town well. You can also see people working in the trade that made the town grow in the Middle Ages, salt, boiling it in the traditional way. There is also the Wurth medieval art collection, a small but very good collection of German Medieval Art that includes works of Hans Holbein the Younger and the Older. However much of what to see however is simply seeing a medieval town, as well as the baroque town square. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nSince it is in the heart of Swabia, Schwabisch Hall has very good Swabian food, with restaurants in all parts of Schwabisch Hall. There are also many good cafes where you can have a good breakfast, and many good bakeries, butchers, pastry shops, and ice cream parlors that sell local cuisine.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nYou can get a cheap beer at the Biergarten, as well as a cheap dinner. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dinkelsbühl"]]},", \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rot an der Rot"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Stuttgart (region)"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["49.11043"],["9.73672"],["zoom=15"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Schwäbisch Hall"]]}]
