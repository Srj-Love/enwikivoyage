Arranged into six continentally-themed aviaries, Sylvan Heights Bird Park, which opened in 2006, offers visitors the chance to travel around the world in 80 minutes (instead of 80 days) to see more than 2,000 birds of over 170 different species, some of the rarest and most endangered in the world! Begin at the Eco-Center with an introductory film and an incubator in the lobby, showing a variety of eggs and a variety of hatching chicks (depending on the time of year). Behind the Eco-Center is the multi-national aviary that houses a variety of birds, representing each continent, then make your way through each continent, South America, North America, Eurasia, Australia and Africa. Along the way are many other fascinating exhibits, including a Beaver Pond Viewing Blind and a handicapped accessible treehouse that both overlook natural wetlands. The Landing Zone is Sylvan Heights' newest exhibit (opening March 2013) that allows visitors to enter an aviary with feed sticks and interact up close and personal with more than 300 birds of 30 different species. Pack a picnic lunch and enjoy one of the picnic areas in the park. Have children? Enjoy an eco-friendly playground and fossil dig - you might find some shark's teeth! Don't miss a trip to the gift shop for a fun souvenir. Even a trip to the restroom at Sylvan Heights can be educational. The restroom facility located near South America (on the way to the Beaver Pond Blind and the treehouse) has a lobby area with three exhibits - a working bee hive, poison dart frogs and a gekko."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Scotland Neck Inn"],["url="],["email="],["address=308 S Main"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=US 258.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["directionl1=S"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jacksonville (North Carolina)"],["Jacksonville"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Tarboro"]]}]}],["directionr1=N"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hampton (Virginia)"],["Hampton"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Franklin (Virginia)"],["Franklin"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["North Carolina Coastal Plain"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["36.130556"],["-77.420833"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Scotland Neck, North Carolina"]]}]
