Two exits off of the winding California State Route 17 (Scotts Valley Drive and Mount Hermon Road) take visitors into the city.  \n\nThere is no train service in Scotts Valley, but a collaboration between Amtrak, Santa Clara County's Valley Transit Authority, and Santa Cruz County's Metro Transit District has resulted in frequent, daily, hour-long bus trips between downtown San Jose and Scotts Valley.  The \"Highway 17 Express\" costs $4 each way; an $8 day pass entitles the bearer to free use of both the VTA and Metro mass transit systems for the day (2008 rates).  In San Jose, this bus stops at the Diridon train station (with connections to CalTrain), VTA light rail stops in downtown San Jose, and at San Jose State University.  In Santa Cruz County, it stops at the Cavallero Transit Center in Scotts Valley (on King's Village Road, just off Mount Hermon Road).  Some routes continue into downtown Santa Cruz.  This bus route is popular with students, non-drivers, and regular commuters to the downtown San Jose area.\n\nGreyhound also provides bus service to the area from San Francisco.\n\nThe nearest airports with scheduled passenger service are in San Jose and Monterey.  The nearest municipal airport for private planes is in Watsonville.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nMost visitors to Scotts Valley drive to nearby attractions.  The main part of the small city is adjacent to California State Route 17.  The city itself has two main roads:  Scotts Valley Drive and Mount Hermon Road.  Scotts Valley Drive parallels Highway 17; Mount Hermon Road proceeds northwest to Felton.\n\nThe primary local bus route in the city, which runs approximately every half hour during the day, goes south to downtown Santa Cruz and north on Mount Hermon Road to the communities in the San Lorenzo Valley.  Rates are $1.50 per adult per trip; there are no transfers.  The main Santa Cruz bus station is in the downtown shopping district and about a fifteen-minute-long walk away from Main Beach in Santa Cruz.  The bus system is more useful for getting in and out of Scotts Valley than for getting from one place to another in the city itself.\n\nVisitors can also take the Highway 17 Express and Greyhound buses to San Jose and the San Francisco Bay area.\n\nThe main city roads are in relatively good condition for bicycling. Some back roads (such as Bean Creek Road) offer scenic but challenging cycling for the experienced cyclist. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Several city parks, including the large Skypark complex, are available for day use at no cost and may be popular with families.
