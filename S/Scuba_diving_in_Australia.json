Yongala"]]},"\n\nThe east coast of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Queensland"]]},", particularly to the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Far North Queensland"],["north"]]},", has Australia's busiest dive industry and most famous dive sites. Most of the diving is tropical reef diving. The bread and butter of many dive operations is teaching tourists to dive, but experienced divers will find some shops that cater to them with longer and more challenging dive trips.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Great Barrier Reef "]},"\n\nThe ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Great Barrier Reef"]]},", a long tropical reef system off Far North Queensland, is Australia's biggest dive attraction. Most divers will dive with shops in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cairns"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Port Douglas"]]}," region or from the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Whitsunday Islands"]]},". The reefs to the far north are generally visited by extended liveaboards rather than day trips. You can dive on the shallow ",{"type":"'''","value":["Inner Reef"]}," or do shore dives from some of the islands in a day trip. Operators usually visit the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Outer Reef"]}," on liveaboards, but some day trips are available. Week long liveaboards will take you to the ",{"type":"'''","value":["ribbon reefs"]}," and the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Coral Sea"]},"; huge tame potato cod and maori wrasse can be seen at nearby ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cod Hole"]},". Some liveaboard packages to the northern reefs include a flight to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lizard Island"]]}," at the north of the reef system so that you don't spend so much of the trip getting to your destination.\n\nThe wreck of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["SS Yongala"]}," lies towards the south of the reef in open water. The SS Yongala sank in a cyclone in 1911 and by the time the wreck was properly identified in 1958 it had become a haven for sealife. Thanks to the currents, the wreck is populated by oversized reef species. Other commonly seen sealife includes sharks, turtles, Queensland groupers as large as small cars, rays and sea snakes. The coast at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Townsville"]]}," is further away from the reef than the coast at Cairns, but some operators leave from Townsville, and Townsville is the obvious point of departure if you want to dive on the Yongala. Another operator leaves from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ayr (Queensland)"],["Ayr"]]},", which is closer to the wreck.\n\nThe ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southern Reef Islands"]]}," have good diving on ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Heron Island"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lady Elliot Island"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Sunshine Coast "]},"\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["HMAS Brisbane"]}," was sunk off the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sunshine Coast (Queensland)"],["Sunshine Coast"]]}," in late July 2005 in order to create a diveable artificial reef with a depth range of  12–27 metres (40–89 feet).",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.nprsr.qld.gov.au\/parks\/ex-hmas-brisbane\/index.html"]},". Operators visit this site from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Noosa"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mooloolaba"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" New South Wales "]},"\n\nThe diving in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New South Wales"]]}," is somewhat overshadowed by Queensland to the north. However, there are several dive destinations along the coast that are more than worth a visit: many coastal areas have vibrant local dive communities, and some of the more northern towns do an extensive trade in teaching travellers to dive.\n\nAs you travel south in New South Wales you move into more temperate waters and will need to be prepared for cooler water temperatures. Water at and below Sydney's latitude ranges between 22℃ (71℉) in summer to 13℃ (55℉) in winter. Divers will typically wear at least 5mm wetsuits in summer and add hoods and vests in winter, or will use semi-dry or drysuits.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" North Coast "]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Byron Bay"]]},"'s excellent diving is starting to become a well known competitor to the best Queensland diving. As in much of northern New South Wales, the waters have a mix of tropical and temperate species. In addition the water temperature goes as high as 27℃\/81℉ and the visibility is on average around 15m. The sites are also currently well managed: there are a small number of commercial vessel launching licences available, vessels use permanent moorings and over-diving isn't taking place. Dolphin sightings are common on the boat trips and whale sightings regular between May and October.\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Solitary Islands Marine Park"]}," off ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Coffs Harbour"]]}," has both tropical and subtropical marine life. Notables are grey nurse sharks, hard and soft coral, anemone fish, and colourful wrasse. Seeing large rays is unusual but not unheard of. Visibility is between 10 and 20 metres, and most of the interesting diving is shallower than 20 metres. Water temperature may be up to 25℃ in summer.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Sydney "]},"\n\nSydneysiders are usually astonished to discover that there's ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sydney"]]}," diving: their beautiful harbour has heavy commercial use. But there are several sites within the harbour, primarily inside the ",{"type":"'''","value":["north and south heads"]},". Most operators leave from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Manly"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Balmoral"]]},". There's good shore diving from ",{"type":"'''","value":["Bare Island"]}," off La Perouse and at the tidal ",{"type":"'''","value":["Shiprock"]}," site at Port Hacking. The ",{"type":"'''","value":["Magic Point"]}," site off Maroubra is a grey nurse shark sanctuary: during the day you can see a number of sharks sleeping in their cave. There are a number of wrecks off-shore that are regularly dived, but most are in 45 meters (150 feet) or more of water and require technical training for that depth. Introductory wreck diving is usually taught on the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Valiant"]}," in 27 meters (88 feet) of water and the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Coolooli"]},", in 36–48 meters (118–157 feet) of water. ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Sydney\/Gordon's Bay"],["Gordon's Bay"]]}]}," has an underwater nature trail, depth 10–15 meters, marked a chain, access from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sydney\/Clovelly"],["Clovelly"]]}," parking lot, where you can find a map with explanations.\n\nVisibility near Sydney is usually 5–15 metres. Soft coral lives even inside the harbour, and it's relatively common to see Port Jackson sharks.\n\nWhile Sydney is not totally unused to diving tourists, it is primarily a local dive scene. Many smaller operators only have rubber dinghies and some do not provide much in the way of dive site briefings, although you might get paired with a patient experienced club member if you're new to diving. Some operators do not hire out mask, snorkel or fins. Ask the operator about the level of experience they cater to when booking.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" South Coast "]},"\n\nThe ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jervis Bay"]]}," area has the best diving in southern New South Wales. It caters to diving travellers far more than the Sydney region and liveaboard trips are available in addition to boat dives. Most dive operators start from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Huskisson"]]},". Good dives are around Bowen Island (weedy seadragons) and Point Perpendicular (nurse sharks).\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Montague Island"]]},", off ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Narooma"]]},", offers the chance of diving with fur seals during spring.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Western Australia "]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Ningaloo Reef "]},"\n\nNingaloo Reef is located off the coast of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gascoyne"]]}," region of Western Australia. Although it is a beautifully untouched fringing reef, able to be snorkelled from shore at some points, the area is most famous for providing opportunities to snorkel with ",{"type":"'''","value":["whale sharks"]}," (diving is available on the same trips, but not with the sharks). See ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.visitoz.net\/Australia\/\/content\/view\/24\/2\/ photos of the Ningaloo Reef"]},".

The Rapid Bay Jetty lies approx. 100 km south of Adelaide near Normanville and Cape Jervis. The dive spot is suitable for a shore entry and exit, but one has to swim nearly 500m to get to the T-section of the jetty where all the beautiful fish are.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Port Noarlunga Jetty "]},"\nEasy and beautiful dive location in Noarlunga, approx. 40 km south of Adelaide. Offers a reef and underwater trail directly accessible by a jetty. The inner side of the reef offers shelter from the weather and is considered a good dive spot for entry-level divers.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Coastal waters of Adelaide "]},"\nThe coastal waters of Adelaide offer also some great dives. There are numerous reefs and wrecks off the coast.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":[" Kangaroo Island "]},"\nThere is diving on ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kangaroo Island"]]}," off the coast of South Australia. A few hours drive and boat ride from Adelaide.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Piccaninnie Ponds Conservation Park"]},"\nPiccaninnie Ponds Conservation Park is a 543 ha protected area in south-eastern South Australia. It adjoins Discovery Bay on South Australia’s Limestone Coast\nPiccaninnie Ponds contains three main features of interest to divers. The ‘First Pond’ is an open depression about 10 m deep with a silt floor and much aquatic life, the ‘Chasm’ is a sinkhole with a depth of over 100 m, and the ‘Cathedral’ is an enclosed area with limestone formations and a depth of about 35 m. Underwater visibility is excellent and may exceed 40 m.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Learn "]},"\n\nThe majority of dive shops in Australia have instructors who can certify you to dive through either the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.padi.com\/ PADI"]}," or ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.divessi.com\/ SSI"]}," certification agencies, and a very small number of shops certify through other agencies. Since agencies generally recognise each other's certifications the most important consideration when choosing a dive course is to feel comfortable with your instructor's teaching style and proposed program. The vast majority of instruction is in English. Japanese and German instruction is offered by some shops in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Far North Queensland"]]},".\n\nIf you intend to take an introductory certification course in Australia, you will need a medical examination to comply with ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.standards.com.au\/catalogue\/script\/Details.asp?DocN=AS002706431346 Australian Standard 4005.1-2000"]},". Ask your dive center for a dive medical form and a list of local doctors able to perform the examination; it needs to be performed by an especially certified Australian doctor. It will cost AU$40 or so. Most dive shops will refund your course fees if the doctor performing the examination refuses to allow you to dive, but do ask before paying upfront.\n\nTypical land-based Open Water certification courses cost between $300 and $500 depending on location; expect to pay the upper end if you are learning on a resort island with one dive shop available and the lower end if you are learning in a major dive area with many shops. Certifications on liveaboard trips generally cost between $100 and $200 on top of the base cost of the trip.\n\nMany dive shops are rather strict about certifications. For example, someone with an Open Water certification and no Advanced certification may be restricted in depth (usually to PADI's 18 meter\/60 foot limit for non-Advanced certified divers) regardless of their dive experience.\n\nIf you want to work in diving, there are a limited number of programs that take uncertified divers and train them to Divemaster or Instructor level, which usually includes these courses: introductory Open Water, advanced Open Water, a course in dive rescue procedures and a dive master course. In addition you will do at least 30 more dives to build up your dive experience. Such courses cost around $6000–$8000 and take 3–6 months to complete.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Work "]},"\n\nIt can be difficult for foreign travellers to find work as divemasters or instructors in Australia: Australia is pretty good at supplying its own instructors. The most likely way to get work is to get short-term work in Far North Queensland during the peak season (the Australian winter, roughly May to September) when demand is highest.\n\nYou will need to have native or near-native command of English if you intend to instruct most students; command of some other languages, particularly German or Japanese, is an asset. Diver operations also have divemaster, cook, coxswain (skipper), deck hand and retail work available. In all cases, the opportunity for independent diving is extremely limited: on most trips all your diving will be work related.\n\nYou will not normally be able to get a dive operation to sponsor an Australian work visa for you, unless you have a truly outstanding set of skills unavailable locally. Most foreign instructors work under the Working Holidaymaker visa arrangements.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Stay healthy "]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Emergency treatment"]},"\n\nThe ",{"type":"'''","value":["Divers Emergency Service"]}," (DES) is a 24 hour emergency service operating in Australia.
