Their lumber was in such demand they built a second mill, then a shipyard to build boats to haul the lumber to California, which had high demand due to the California Gold Rush. Eventually, along with four saloons, the town had two general stores and two hotels. In 1876, there were over 400 people living in Seabeck. After decades of success, in the 1880s, the demand had eased, and most of the easily accessible trees had been harvested. In 1886 a spark from the ship Retriever started a fire that consumed both mills, along with other buildings. Rumors flew that the mills would not be re-built, so most residents moved to other towns with mills, notably Port Hadlock, turning Seabeck into a virtual ghost town.\n\nToday Seabeck has found its footing as a tourist destination and quiet community with basic services and hopes to soon become a major recreational port along Hood Canal when its marina is finished.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["By car"]},"\nLocated on Seabeck Highway NW about a 16 minute drive west of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Silverdale (Washington)"],["Silverdale"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["By boat"]}," \n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Seabeck Marina"],["url="],["email="],["address=15376 Seabeck Hwy NW"],["lat=47.64027"],["long=-122.82694"],["directions="],["phone=+1 360 830-4839"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=is under development and not currently open."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Misery Point Water Access"],["url=http:\/\/wdfw.wa.gov\/lands\/water_access\/30670\/"],["email="],["address=15376 Seabeck Hwy NW"],["lat=47.65244"],["long=-122.82909"],["directions=Southwest from Seabeck .6 mi on Seabeck Holly Rd, right .6 mi n Miami Beach Rd, left 1.4 mi on Miami Beach Lp Rd to public fishing sign, access on right."],["phone=+1 360 830-4839"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content= concrete boat launch near Seabeck is open year round and has overflow parking."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nSeabeck is a small town and everything is easily accessible by foot.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Kitsap Transit"],["url=http:\/\/www.kitsaptransit.org\/"],["email=kitsapride@kitsaptransit.com"],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 360 479-6962"],["tollfree=+1-800-501-7433"],["fax="],["hours="],["price=full fare $2 and is part of the regional ORCA network system"],["content=Kitsap Transit offers transit services throughout the area including pickup from all ferry terminals and connects with Mason Transit (Mason County), Pierce Transit (Pierce County), and Jefferson Transit (Jefferson County) offering connections outside of the area."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Scenic Beach State Park"],["url=http:\/\/www.parks.wa.gov\/parks\/?selectedpark=Scenic%20Beach"],["email="],["address=9565 Scenic Beach Rd NW"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 360 902-8844"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content= is a 88-acre camping park with 1,500 feet of saltwater beachfront on Hood Canal.
