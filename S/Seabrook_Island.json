The island is a private gated community and security is tight. If you are not a property owner, guest of a property owner, or renting property on Seabrook, you will be denied access.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nIt is a good idea to bring your own vehicle or get a rental car if you're flying. Seabrook provides no transportation to or from the airport nor is any transportation available to get around the island. Furthermore, the speed limit on Seabrook is 25 MPH. This is strictly enforced. You will be ticketed at 26 MPH and they don't give warnings.\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nSeabrook is a very remote island but there is a lot to see on the island. There is plenty of wildlife. Deer, alligators, bobcats, racoons, and numerous species of birds call Seabrook home. There is also a three mile long beach and beautiful marshes on the island.\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nIf you are renting a home or villa on Seabrook, you'll want to make sure that the owner has a club membership. If the owner does not have a club membership, the only amenity you'll have access to is the beach unless you are staying in a villa complex with it's own pool. With the club membership, you will be able to use the pool at the Seabrook club free of charge. Other amenities include golf, tennis, an equestrian center, fitness center, and very nice restaurants. Of course, these other amenities are not free but fees are quite reasonable. The island also has an abundance of activities for children as well. You'll also want to make the short drive into Charleston, which has a great deal to see and do as well.\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nOther than a small gift shop, there isn't much shopping on the island, however, you can go to Freshfields Plaza which has several great stores.\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nThe island has one restaurant called the Island House. In order to eat here, you must be a club member or renting from an owner who is a club member. The Bohicket Marina is just before the security gate and has several great restaurants as well and of course, you can always go into Charleston\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nThere are no hotels or high rises on Seabrook so your only option as far as lodging is to rent one of the privately owned homes or villas. You can rent directly from a property owner or through one of the rental agencies on the island. It is not a good idea to come the first week of November because each year at this time, Seabrook hosts the Super Seniors Tennis Tournament and it will be tough to get any homes or villas. Not only that, but you can expect long lines at the security gate during this time.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["32.57722"],["-80.17056"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Greater Charleston"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Seabrook Island, South Carolina"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North_America\/United_States\/South_Carolina\/Localities\/S\/Seabrook_Island\/"]]}]
