Note that it shares its name with the province of which it is the capital.\n\nBuses between Segovia and Madrid run once or twice an hour depending on time of day.  In Madrid, they arrive\/depart from Principe Pio bus station.  The Segovia bus station is on Paseo de Ezequiel Gonzalez, near the Aqueduct. In December 2007, a new high-speed train line was opened connecting Segovia to many Spanish cities, in particular Madrid (30 minutes) and Valladolid (40 minutes). The new AVE (high-speed train) station is called Segovia-Guiomar and is 5km from the city, with a bus link every 15 minutes from the aqueduct.\n\nTrains to Segovia from Madrid are typically an extension of the C-8b suburban rail line (beyond Cercedilla), and cost around €6 for a one-way ticket. You can board a train heading for Segovia from several stations in Madrid (e.g. Atocha and Chamartin). Bus number 8 takes you from the train station to town centre.
