When available (three times a year), it is easily the cheapest way to get around Japan, costing only ¥11,500 for five days of unlimited travel.\n\nJR argues that \"in general, the Japan Rail Pass offers a much better deal to almost all foreign travelers.\" However, the two are hardly comparable for a number of reasons. The Japan Rail Pass, which offers unlimited travel on almost all JR trains for a 7, 14, or 21-day period, caters to tourists who are planning to visit various points in Japan, and who want to save as much time as possible along the way. It costs much more than the Seishun 18 Ticket, but allows holders to use express and ",{"type":"''","value":["Shinkansen"]}," trains that can be many times as fast.\n\nThe Seishun 18 Ticket, on the other hand, caters to budget conscious travelers who are willing to sacrifice speed for the ability to get just about anywhere in the country for under ¥5,000. In fact, its name literally means \"Youth 18,\" and its main target audience is college students. However, anyone can purchase the ticket, regardless of age, student status, or nationality.\n\nIf you're planning on traveling in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hokkaido"]]}," or Eastern Japan (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tohoku"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kanto"]]}," and the eastern Koshin'etsu side of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chubu"]]},"), also consider the very similar ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["#Hokkaido and Higashi-Nihon Pass"],["Hokkaido and Higashi-Nihon Pass"]]}]}," (covered below), which fills in a few gaps in the JR network but adds some extra restrictions.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Using the ticket"]},"\n\nThe ticket is actually five one-day passes condensed onto a single piece of ticket stock. When using the ticket for the first time, the passenger presents it at the manned ticket gate, and the  employee on hand stamps the ticket, making it valid on every non-express JR train until midnight. After midnight, the ticket becomes invalid unless it is stamped again. The ticket has spaces for five stamps, after which it is invalid.\n\nMore than one person can travel on the same ticket: each of the five spaces on the ticket allows one person to ride for one day. For instance, if two passengers were using the ticket, the ticket would be stamped twice; at the end of the day, both passengers could use the ticket for another day and have one stamp space left over, or one of the passengers could use the ticket for three days. Likewise, a group of five could travel for one day on a single ticket: the cost would be only ",{"type":"'''","value":["¥2300 per person"]},", which, for example, is more than 70% off of a regular one-way fare between Tokyo and Osaka.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["The ticket cannot be used on super express, limited express, express or sleeper trains, including any train on the Shinkansen network."]}," This is the main catch to the ticket, and the main reason why many travellers may prefer to use the Japan Rail Pass. When using the Seishun 18 Ticket, you are restricted to local (普通 ",{"type":"''","value":["futsū"]},"), rapid (快速 ",{"type":"''","value":["kaisoku"]},") and super\/special rapid (新快速 ",{"type":"''","value":["shin-kaisoku"]},") trains, which are designed for regional trips, not cross-country travel. Traveling from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tokyo"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kyoto"]]},", for instance, takes as little as two and a half hours on the Shinkansen, but takes nine hours on rapid trains. The upshot to this is that you can stop in various towns along the way: taking a full day to travel from Tokyo to Kyoto, you would have enough time to visit Odawara, Nagoya, and other cities along the Tokaido Line. Using overnight trains can also help dull the effect, and possibly save on lodging expenses (see below).\n\nThere are a few exceptions to the above rule, which allow passengers to travel across two areas that have no local rail service:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Limited expresses on the Tsugaru-Kaikyo Line between Kikonai (木古内) and Kanita (蟹田) stations; this is a very useful exception because it allows Seishun 18 holders to cross between the main island of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Honshu"]]}," and the northern island of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hokkaido"]]}," through the world's longest undersea tunnel, the Seikan Tunnel."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Limited expresses on the Sekisho Line between Shintoku (新得) and Shin-Yubari (新夕張), part of the route between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sapporo"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Obihiro"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hokkaido"]]},"."]},"\nIn both cases, the Seishun 18 Ticket can only be used to travel in non-reserved cars between the designated stations.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The Seishun 18 Ticket can also be used on the Aoimori Railway in northern Tohoku.

Trains run every 15 minutes or so during the day, making it easy to take breaks en route without running over schedule. It takes about nine hours to get from Tokyo to Kyoto, not including rest or meal stops; this requires about 4-6 transfers along the way depending on when you travel.

It can be used for a Tokyo-Nagoya trip, but the Tokaido Line is much faster. Although the Tokyo and Nagoya areas are frequently served by commuter trains, the corridor between Kofu and Nakatsugawa is much less densely populated, and trains only run every two hours in some areas.
