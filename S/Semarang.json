It is a bustling, growing mid-sized city with a population of 1.5 million. More an administrative and business town, rather than tourism destination, it nevertheless has its own charm. With contrasting modern mid-rises, a significant set of Dutch colonial architecture, Chinatown, and small \"kampong\", all jutting against each other.  \n\nRecent efforts started in 2007 have been made by the government to promote it as a tourist destination, such as the rather presumptuously named ",{"type":"''","value":["Semarang Pesona Asia"]}," (Semarang, Asia's Enchantment) and, indeed, Semarang does have several tourist attractions within its borders and in nearby towns, like Ambarawa, Salatiga, Bandungan and Demak.\n\nSemarang, in contrast to many Indonesian cities, still has a fair amount of greenery but locals will tell you that areas that used to be (by their standards) \"cold\" are no longer.  The city's weather is hot and humid, except on the slope - where it is slightly more pleasant - up towards Ungaran, so wear light-coloured cotton clothes, such as a T-shirt and knee-length trousers for comfort.  Don't be surprised, however, if you see lots of people on motorcycles dressed as if bracing for autumn. Some places, like ",{"type":"''","value":["masjid"]}," (mosques) and ",{"type":"''","value":["puri\/candi"]}," (temples) as well as government offices, require polite dress such as long trousers\/skirts and neat clothes. Hot pants\/mini skirts will attract people's attention in ways you might not like and might be considered impolite, although changing perceptions of fashion have wrought recent changes in this growing metropolis.\n\nSemarang is still rather off the tourist trail and knowing even basic ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Indonesian phrasebook"],["Indonesian"]]}," will be helpful and  ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Javanese phrasebook"],["Javanese"]]}," will be well-received, although younger educated people are often able to speak some English, especially those from the middle and upper classes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nSemarang's airport ",{"type":"''","value":["Bandar Udara Internasional Achmad Yani"]},", (Achmad Yani International Airport) (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["SRG"]]},") is quite near the city centre, Simpang Lima. Daily flights are available to many major cities in Indonesia and AirAsia offers flights to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kuala Lumpur"]]},". Garuda Indonesia occasionally offers flights to Singapore but this offering comes and goes from the choices available and so cannot be relied upon. Batavia Air ceased all operations, including international services to and from Singapore on 31 January 2013.  International flights are available to both Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, both provided by AirAsia. The airport is rather small but outside of the security gate (there's only one) there are several restaurants and shops for those who are waiting, and the walk from the departure security gate to the arrivals gate is no more than a minute.\n\nOnce (ticket-holders only) past the security gate, you'll find yourself on a direct path to the check-in desks.  There are more shops and restaurants inside the airport, including Periplus Books, which specialises in English-text materials.  After paying the airport tax (usually around Rp 30,000), you are free to move further right to the domestic terminal, followed by the international terminal, both of which were renovated around 2010.  There are several TVs you can watch, although you probably won't be able to hear anything, and there may be a free Internet kiosk.  Please do realise that Indonesians in general are not very good at waiting in line (queuing), so you might find it easier to wait until the line has diminished before standing up.  If you are confused, do not hesitate to ask an employee, many of whom speak some English.  The walk across the tarmac to your plane is generally short.\n\nThe arrivals \"hall\" is a much simpler affair.  Once you've walked in off the tarmac (rain or shine), you'll find yourself in the baggage claim area, so find yourself a trolley if you've lots of bags and post yourself somewhere along the single belt.  After that, you can proceed up the ramp and out the arrivals door into the waiting throng, where it is easy to get a taxi.  There is a dedicated pool of taxis on standby at the airport but the price is more expensive than if you ride with another company - if you can find one.\n\nFrom the airport, you can also take a bus (Trans Semarang Koridor IV) from the bus stop (shelter) located just outside the parking lot gate. Buses going towards Cangkiran and the city centre both stops here. To go to the city centre (e.g. Simpang Lima or the City Hall), transfer to Koridor I in Karangayu. Ticket costs a flat fare of Rp 3,500 which includes transfers to another corridor, so keep your ticket for checking.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Airlines and

",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bandung"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Surabaya"]]}," by train. Interestingly, there is no comparable railway service to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yogyakarta"]]},", although a railway line exists. The ",{"type":"'''","value":["Argo Muria"]}," express connects Semarang to Jakarta, and with its relatively new equipment (2002), is very comfortable. The downside is the 05:00 departure time to Jakarta. Overnight trains are also available. The fastest train ride between Semarang and Jakarta takes around 6 hours.  One of the luxuries of trains in Indonesia is that there is no express limit on how much luggage you bring with you, and porters are always hoping to earn a bit of money by carrying your bags.  Keep in mind, however, the condition on economy and business trains is not generally enjoyable for the pampered traveler.\n\nBandung and Surabaya are also connected to Semarang with air-conditioned ",{"type":"''","value":["eksekutif"]}," (executive) class trains.  As with most executive trains in Indonesia, the AC is usually set very low, so be sure to bring a blanket or have extra clothes you can put on to keep warm.  Also, trains are equipped with TVs in each car set to KATV, so you'll be able to enjoy a variety of comedy shorts as well as a feature-length movie - but the speakers may not be up to the task.\n\nFood is offered during the journey, but it is generally over-priced instant noodles and fried rice - you'd be better served bringing food on yourself.\n\nThere are two main railway stations in Semarang, ",{"type":"'''","value":["Stasiun Tawang"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Stasiun Poncol"]},", the former of which is the main station and the one you'll need to go to for executive trains and a better choice of destinations.  The layout is the fairly straightforward layout of most smaller cities with a ticketing area upon entry and a gate beyond which only passengers can pass.  Be sure to ask which ",{"type":"''","value":["jalur"]}," (track) your train will be on.  The station is on the small side so if you're hoping to buy snacks or food prior to departure, you should do it elsewhere.\n\nPlease note that smoking is prohibited on trains run by PT. Kereta Api Indonesia (Persero) and hawkers are prohibited from getting on, although you'll find them on the platforms.\n\nOn the northern main line, between Semarang and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pekalongan"]]},", the railway line follows the coast, providing passengers with beautiful views of the Java Sea.\n\nFor further information, please see their website ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.kereta-api.co.id\/ PT. KA"]},", in Indonesian only.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nSemarang can be reached by car from Jakarta. It takes around 10-12 hours depending on traffic. You can choose to leave early in the morning from Jakarta to arrive in Semarang in the next 12 hours or so. An over-night drive is faster yet more challenging and even dangerous for \"Pantura\", a driver who's not familiar with the roads.  Pantura derives from \"Pantai\" which means beach and \"Utara\" which means North.\n\nFrom Jakarta, you can take the Eastward route via Cikampek Tollway. Go along the toll road until you reach the Cikampek toll gate, take a left and you are in \"Pantura Road\".  In Pantura road you have to follow the directing signs to \"Cirebon\", \"Pekalongan\", \"Kendal\", \"Semarang\" or \"Surabaya\" as those cities are east of Jakarta.\n\nYou will pass small towns like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Patrol"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jatibarang"]]},", and relatively bigger ones like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cirebon"]]},". Before entering Cirebon, you can take the toll-road, which will steer you out of the heavy traffic, bypassing it altogether.  That is, if you do want to avoid traffic and do not intend to sight-see Cirebon. After exiting the Cirebon toll road, you should drive eastward along Losari and then you will pass ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tegal"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pemalang"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pekalongan"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kendal (Java)"],["Kendal"]]}," before you arrive in Semarang. \n\nGas stations are abundant, you can see them almost every 5-10 km along the road. They have toilet facilities, but usually only squat pots.  Deposit Rp1,000 in the locked box stationed outside the toilets as you enter or leave.  Beware of small or old gas stations as they have poor lighting and terrible toilets. Choose a newer and bigger gas station with good lighting, parking spaces and clean toilets. Please make sure that you have locked your car and do not leave your valuables unattended.\n\nYou can reach Semarang from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yogyakarta"]]},"\/",{"type":"[[","value":[["Solo"]]}," via the new tollway, which should take rather less than 2 hours, or you can take the highways and arrive in about 2-3 hours, giving allowance for traffic.  Please note that drivers from Solo are noted for their more aggressive and more reckless driving - which is saying something in a country where driving seems aggressive and reckless.\n\nSemarang can be reached from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Banyumas"]]},"\/",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cilacap"]]}," without traveling through Yogyakarta via highways and streets.  If you choose to travel through ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Magelang"]]},", be prepared for traffic problems, as well as in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ambarawa"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ungaran"]]},".  Your best bet is to leave late at night via ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Purbalingga"]]}," so that you can arrive early in the morning in Semarang, which will take about 8 hours (via Magelang-Ambarawa-Ungaran).  If, however, you'd like a more scenic (during the daytime) and a faster drive, avoid Magelang entirely by traveling through ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Temanggung"]]},", bypassing Magelang entirely, after which you can choose to drive through ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bandungan"]]}," and take advantage of their all-day fruit and vegetable market, or take another route that isn't as mountainous as Bandungan (such as through ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Secang"]]}," then Ambarawa).  Bandungan is a mountainous, rural area that also offers ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gedungsongo Park"]]}," and numerous small hotels and it is only about 30 minutes (given good traffic) from Semarang.  Average travel time for sane drivers is 5.5-6 hours.  For F1 drivers, expect a record of 4-4.5 hours.\n\nIf you're coming from Surabaya, this is rather a long drive that doesn't follow the coast.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nMany bus companies offer daily service from Jakarta to Semarang. You can choose to go in the day time with air conditioned (A\/C) from Pasar Rebo Bus Terminal in East Jakarta, Kalideres Bus Terminal in West Jakarta or from Lebak Bulus Bus Terminal in South Jakarta. The overnight bus with A\/C are also available with good services. You can choose bus operators such as: \"Rosalia Indah\" ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/rosalia-indah.com\/"]},", \"Raya\", \"Kramat Jati\", Safari Dharma Raya ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.safaridharmaraya.com\/"]}," as the good reputed bus serving Jakarta to Semarang. Sometimes the bus route is Jakarta to Solo via Semarang. You can choose them too, but please remind the bus driver's assistant, (The person who checks your ticket on-board the bus) to wake you up in Semarang!!.\n\nThere is also the executive-class tourist bus Joglosemar, that connects Jogjakarta, Solo and Semarang (hence the name). Joglosemar picks up tourists from specific hotels and provide snacks and water for your trip. Considerably pricier than other executive buses, it is more comfortable and provides a friendly service throughout the journey.\n\nIf you are on a group, you can also rent a \"Tourist\/Charter Bus\" ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.buspariwisata.kalimas.co.id\/"]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\n\nJakarta - Semarang and vice-versa, Is mostly a traditionally via-railway traveled route along the northern coast road (\"pantura\") or by aircraft. A trip by boat or sea vessel is uncommon due to its rare schedule and the length of the journey that takes too long compared with a train (approx 6 hours) and over-night bus (9 hours).\n\nHowever, cruise ships occasionally spend a day in port.  The port has few facilities for passengers, but an informal market of street vendors often assembles outside the secure-area.  Most passengers take a one day tour to Borobudur.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By mini bus\/bus"]},"\n\nThere are medium-sized buses operated by government-owned company DAMRI in the city. These DAMRI buses are normally blue and white inc colour. DAMRI buses travels along the following routes:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" DAMRI Route No.1: Terboyo-Banyumanik "]},{"type":"*","value":[" DAMRI Route No.2: Terboyo-Mangkang "]},{"type":"*","value":[" DAMRI Route No.3: Ngaliyan-Pucang Gading"]},{"type":"*","value":[" DAMRI Route No.4: Johar-Kompleks Perumnas "]},{"type":"*","value":[" DAMRI Route No.5: Mangkang-Ungaran (via toll road)"]},{"type":"*","value":[" DAMRI Route No.6: Penggaron-Ungaran (via toll road)"]},"\nAll the buses operated by DAMRI are air-conditioned, and relatively well-maintained. There are also routes operated by other private companies(Rata Kencana, MINAS, Nugroho, etc.) although they mostly use non air-conditioned buses and the fleet tends to be less well-maintained. All these buses stops whenever a passenger flags them. Accordingly, to alight you just have to tell the driver or conductor and the bust will pull aside and stop. There are very few designated bus stops and no route maps whatsoever, so it is good to ask a local beforehand and double check with the conductor. Fares range anywhere from Rp 2,000 to Rp 8,000 depending on the distance travelled.\n\nAside from those buses, there are also Trans Semarang buses with designated bus stops on raised platforms (locally known as shelter). Despite being called a BRT system, the buses do not travel on a designated lane. There are currently three operational corridors:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Koridor I Penggaron-Mangkang"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Koridor II Pudakpayung-Terboyo"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Koridor IV Cangkiran-Ahmad Yani Airport-Karangayu"]},"\nFurther expansion works are currently conducted for corridors 3, 5, and 6. \nTicket costs a flat Rp 3,500 for adult and Rp 2,000 for students. Make sure to keep your ticket when transferring from one line to another so that you won't have to buy a new ticket. Some of the less-frequented shelters do not have officials selling ticket, so you have to buy one on-board. This is by far the most friendly method of going around for visitors, although coverage is still lacking.\n\nThere are also plenty of minibuses (locally called angkot\/daihatsu) serving various other routes. The minibus has the route written on the windscreen, most of the times also at the back and the side of the vehicle. The route is normally written in the form of 'origin-destination' and sometimes with ' VIA ' information if there is more than 1 mini bus with the same origin-destination but through a different route or path in between. For example, the written route Johar-Sampangan, means that the origin is from Johar, with the end point being Sampangan and vice-versa. The fares for the mini-bus is around Rp 2,000-3,000. There are two kinds of minibuses, the orange coloured ones, which travels longer routes across the city, and the yellow coloured ones, which travels much shorter routes (e.g. from certain housing complexes to the nearest market or terminal). Do ask the conductor\/driver of the minibus before you board, for the route it goes and whether it passes by the place you want to go. This is where you need some rudimentary Indonesian as the person you ask are unlikely to speak English.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\n\nTaxis are very safe and comfortable, and reasonably priced (starting price, Rp 4,000).\n\nMake sure you understand the route or ask a friend.

Be warned, however, that the sea is slowly reclaiming the coastal lowlands - a beautiful park showcasing traditional architecture has been partially inundated - and daily sea flooding occurs in some places, plus the temperatures and humidity can make it uncomfortably hot (above 32C).

Flashlight tours of the foundation, with it's interesting system of small pools of water to help keep it cool, are a fun scare.  The attic, with its twin water towers, is also interesting as it was used by the military at one point as a badminton court.  During World War II, it was used as the Japanese army's headquarters, and further atrocities were committed by the Japanese. Lawang Sewu's main attraction is its tall stained glass windows. The building is now undergoing restoration and usage by the railway company once again, after many years of laying vacant and being used for events; fortunately it is still open to the public. Tour guides are available at the building's entrance. Though reputed to be haunted by a variety of supernatural beings from various eras due to the great number of executions there before and during WWII, Lawang Sewu remains one of Semarang's most prominent landmarks.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Museums"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Museum Ronggowarsito"],["url=http:\/\/www.museumronggowarsito.org"],["email="],["address=Jl.

Some of them offer short courses of study via the Darmasiswa scholarship program for foreigners, while others offer courses independently of that or in cooperation with other organizations.\n\nDiponegoro University is a state university and is the biggest and the oldest university (est. 1956), and houses 11 faculties:  law, economics, medicine, architecture, engineering, fisheries and marine sciences, animal agriculture, humanities, social and political sciences, public health, natural sciences and mathematics, and psychology. It hosts almost 40,000 students in its two campuses, Pleburan (downtown) and Tembalang in the southern hilly part of Semarang.  It sometimes ranks amongst the world's top 500 universities.

For a foreigner who wants to work in Semarang, this is a good place because of its landscape and variety of work available; it is also strategic since  an international airport, a KanIm Kelas I (Class I Immigration office) and the KanWil KemenKumHAM (Regional Office of the Ministry of Law and Human Rights) are seated there, as is the ",{"type":"''","value":["Polisi Daerah"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["PolDa"]}," - Provincial Police Headquarters), making handling work and stay permits much easier than in non-capital cities, towns and villages. You can live in the hilly and considerably cooler housing area in Candisari or Bukit Sari while you work in the downtown area. Traffic jams are considered to be fewer than in Bandung or Surabaya but the last couple of years have seen an upswing in traffic problems.  Also, Semarang is famous for frugal business owners and is one of the most competitive cities to do business in.  Some claim that if your business can survive here, it can survive in any part of Indonesia.\n\nSemarang is the home of the biggest \"Jamu\" (means \"javanese traditional herbal medicine\") industry such as Jamu Jago, Nyonya Meneer and others. \n\nMost of Jakarta's major banks and companies have opened branches in Semarang.

Never look at someone (especially young men) straight in the eyes more than 3 times as it might be considered as \"challenging them to fight\" (this applies especially in bigger towns\/cities) - Villagers are more friendly to strangers.\n\nSemarang is neither a small city nor huge city if compared to Jakarta. Everyone is urged to observe universal safety rules such as \"only walk in the light-bright areas\"; do not attempt to deal with hookers or trans-sexual hookers which are usually done under secluded and dark areas; lady travelers are urged not to travel alone after 23:00 especially in an unknown dark neighborhood, sometimes even in residential areas. Only withdraw a moderate amount of money in an open air ATM.\n\nWhen riding the public transportation it is not encouraged to wear jewellery, or gaudy and branded or designer watches. Petty thieves are common, but they do not strike when it isn't obvious. During the night if you must use public transportation, look for those units which  have more than a few people riding and do avoid the empty ones.
