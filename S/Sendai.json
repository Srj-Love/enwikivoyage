It's very green — in fact they call it 杜の都 (",{"type":"''","value":["Mori no Miyako"]},", \"Forest City\"). The main avenues around the city are wide and tree-lined, giving the city an almost European feel. The main shopping street — confusingly known by two different names, Chūō-dōri (中央通り) and Clis Road — is pedestrianised and covered, so it feels like a mall.  Several large universities are located in Sendai, attracting young adults from throughout the Tohoku area.\n \n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nAlthough there is evidence of settlements in the Sendai region dating back over 20,000 years, it was not until the local feudal ruler, Date Masamune, moved his capital here in 1600 that the city began to take on any signifance. He established a fine castle on Aobayama (green leaf mountain) and the town that was built below the castle near the Hirose River was built according to the traditional street grid pattern. The original name of the area was also Sendai, but the Chinese characters for this name were changed. Originally they referred to a temple on Aobayama that housed a thousand Buddha statues. Later, Date Matsume changed the Chinese characters to mean 'hermit on a platform,' which referred to a mythical palace in the mountains in China.  It is this latter name that is currently used by the present-day city.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nThere are two ways of looking at the weather here.  One is the way most Japanese people seem to look at it: it's not too cold in the winter and not too hot in the summer, compared to other Japanese cities to the south. Others find it chilly year round. \n\nWinter temperatures rarely dip below zero Celsius, and snow, though frequent in winter, melts quickly. Winter weather is very rainy, yielding to variable weather in Spring. There is a long rainy season, marked by consistently cool and cloudy weather, which typically coincides with the month of June, but has been known to set in right after the cherry-blossom blooms in April and to continue through July, and even August. \n\nWhen (and if) the rainy season ends, Summer weather is very hot and humid, until September, which brings typhoon season. Most of the typhoons do little damage, having dissipated somewhat on their travel north, but fall on Sendai as very heavy rainstorms, following one another in close succession. \n\nFor those who prefer dry sunny weather, Autumn is the most reliable time for pleasant conditions in Sendai. In October, the weather becomes clear, dry and sunny, though cool, usually throughout the month and sometimes well into November. Daytime temperatures hover around 18C, with cooler nights. Rice harvesting is done at this time, while the fields are golden.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Sendai Airport"]}," (SDJ) ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.sdj-airport.com\/english\/index.html"]},") mainly functions as a domestic airport with regular flights to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sapporo"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nagoya"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Osaka"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hiroshima"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fukuoka"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Okinawa"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kanazawa"]]},"(komatsu).
