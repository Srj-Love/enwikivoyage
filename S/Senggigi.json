Private villa on 800 m². Butler service 7AM-11PM. Villa sleeps maximum 6 people. Airport pick-up provided. Located very close to Mangsit's smaller Mosque so if the call to morning prayers may cause upset due to interrupting your sleep then you may want to consider an alternative. Depending on personal sensitivity, calls to prayer or other daily announcements broadcast from the Mosque may not be found excessive but it is quite difficult to miss."]]}]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Hospitals"]},"\n\nSeveral hospitals are located in Mataram including the islands main public hospital Rumah Sakit Umun, Risa Hospital in Cakranegara near Mataram mall and RS Harapan Keluarga in Selagalas east of the city.\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"''","value":["Please see the Lombok main ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lombok#Cope"],["article"]]}," for a list of medical facilities available in Mataram."]}]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Medical clinics"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Holiday Resort Lombok-Medical clinic"],["url="],["email="],["address=Mangsit beach, Senggigi"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=halfway through Mangsit beach,the clinic is downstairs, on northeast corner of main building"],["phone=+62 370 693 444"],["tollfree="],["fax=+62 370 693 092, +62 370 693 206"],["hours="],["price="],["content=On site medical clinic with qualified nurse and doctor on call."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Klinik Risa"],["alt=Risa Centra Medika Hospital"],["url="],["email="],["address=Jl.

The reality is that unless within the confines of the main city of Mataram\/Ampenan\/Cakranegara an ambulance is normally too far away to provide prompt transport in the case of a true emergency.
