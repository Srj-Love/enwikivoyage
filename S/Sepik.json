Its level can alter by as much as five metres in the course of the year. In the south of the province are mountain ranges that form part of the Sepik's large catchment area that includes swamplands, tropical rainforests and mountains."]},"\nEuropean contact on the river began in 1885, when the Germans explored the area. Tourist trips up and down are possible. It is best visited in June to November when there are less mosquitoes. For the truly adventurous it should be possible to rent dugout canoes with outboards and boatman at the river villages closest to the province's capital, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wewak"]]},". The people living along the river are noted for their carvings and elaborate manhood initiation ceremonies. Many villages use garamut drums, which are long, hollowed-out tree trunks carved into the shape of totem animals. Many villages have a Haus Tambaran which is a traditional ancestral worship house. The most recognizable forms of this are found around the village of Maprik. The Sepik people are renowned for their superb artistic ability in painting and carving, which is often exhibited in these religious structures. Papua New Guinea's first prime minister, Michael Somare, came from the Sepik region and it is perhaps no coincidence that the design of the country's parliament building in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Port Moresby"]]}," was based on a Haus Tambaran.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:WLANL - 23dingenvoormusea - Sepik redenaarsstoelen.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["250px"],["A traditional carving from the Sepik Region"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["West Sepik"]}," is also known as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Sandaun"]}," (sun down) province, as it is, with Western Province, the most westerly of PNG's provinces.
