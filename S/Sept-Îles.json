As such, hitchhiking is pretty straightforward. People traveling on this road are likely to accomplish long distances because towns and cities are few and far between. However, just going from Quebec City to Sept-Iles in your own car takes around 8 hours ; add the waiting time, and getting to Sept-Iles is likely to take you 2 days of hitchhiking. Wild camping is pretty easy during the summer months, but winter in Quebec is quite harsh and camping in winter is impossible without specialized gear (waiting for a ride at -30C is also quite dangerous). Nevertheless, if you leave very early from Quebec city (or east of there), it is possible to arrive in Sept-Îles in one day.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nCar is the best way to get around the city. For places within the city, walking is quite easy, but if you want to go to the beach, or any place remotely outside the city, you will definitely need a car.\n\nAt the tourist office, you can rent bicycles for 10$\/day. Helmets and bicycle locks are included. \n\nOf course, there are also taxis. If you go out in the evening, a taxi is your only option if you don't want to walk.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Shaputuan Museum"],["url=http:\/\/www.webtamtam.com\/shaputuan\/"],["email="],["address=290 boulevard des Montagnais"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +1 418  962-4000"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=A small museum located downtown.
