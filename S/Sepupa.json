The daily departure times from Maun are 8:30am, 11:00am, and 16:30pm. Look for the bus with the destination sign for Shakawe. Sepupa is just couple stops before ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shakawe"]]},". There are no ticket counters at the bus rank, so the tickets cannot be purchased ahead of time. The ticket payment is collected right on the bus. The bus is pretty basic: 5 non-reclining seats in a row, little leg-room and no bathrooms .The bus ride takes about 4.5 hrs and the bus drops you off in Sepupa next to a little store (about 3km from the Swamp Stop and the shore river bank). If you are headed to Swamp Stop, ask to be dropped off by the turn with a sing “Swamp Stop”. Once in Sepupa, you will have to rely on flagging down a vehicle to give you a lift to the Swamp Stop. Keep in mind that sometimes part of the road to Swamp Stop gets flooded and the only way to get over is to have someone from the Swamp Stop to fetch you on a mokoro boat or on a tractor; so phone ahead of time or have a mobile handy.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Sepupa Swamp Stop"]},". telephone: 687-7073.
