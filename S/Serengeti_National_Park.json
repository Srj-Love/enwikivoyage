As well as conserving wildlife, flora and iconic landscapes, Serengeti National Park has emerged as a major traveller and tourist destination, many making the journey there to engage in safari. The name Serengeti comes from the Maasai language, meaning 'endless plains'.",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.voyageafrica.net\/serengeti-national-park-perfectly-serene.html Serengeti National Park"]}]}," is most famous for its migration. Nearly one million wildebeest and 200,000 zebras move from the northern hills to the south every October and November during the short rains. They then move toward the west and north from April to June when the long rains progress. The instinct to migrate is strong. Hence, no drought, gorge, or river infested with crocodiles can prove to be a deterrent.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nTwo World Heritage Sites and two Biosphere Reserves have been established within the 30,000 kmÂ² region. Its unique ecosystem has inspired writers from Ernest Hemingway to Peter Mattheissen, filmakers like Hugo von Lawick and Alan Root as well as numerous photographers and scientists.\n\nThe Serengeti ecosystem is one of the oldest on earth. The essential features of climate, vegetation and fauna have barely changed in the past million years. Early man himself made an appearance in Olduvai Gorge about two million years ago. Some patterns of life, death, adaptation and migration are as old as the hills themselves.\n\nIt is the migration for which Serengeti is perhaps most famous. Over a million wildebeest and about 200,000 zebras flow south from the northern hills to the southern plains for the short rains every October and November, and then swirl west and north after the long rains in April, May and June. So strong is the ancient instinct to move that no drought, gorge or crocodile infested river can hold them back.\n\nOver 90,000 tourists visit the Park each year.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Wildlife"]},"\nWildlife viewing in the Serengeti Ecosystem with its Great Migration is tremendous! Nowhere on earth is there a sight rivalling the spectacle of 1.5 million hoofed animals on the march. Serengeti has the highest concentration of large mammals on this planet and is famous for its 2,500 lions, the highest concentration found anywhere! Unlike in Kenya (and with the exception of the Ngorongoro Crater), you rarely see other tourists or vehicles on a game drive in the Serengeti National Park.\n\nWild animals can be dangerous and you should not wander off on your own, especially at night, while on safari (in Swahili simply means \"journey\").However most animals are rather frightened by humans and will flee instead of attacking unless cornered or provoked. Keep a sensible distance and treat them with respect.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Birding"]},"\nEarly and late daylight hours are usually the best times to observe the more than 518 species of birds which have been identified in the Serengeti. Some of them are Eurasian migrants who are present in the European winter months from October to April.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nThe Serengeti falls into the classic bimodal rain pattern of East Africa. The short rains are concentrated in November\/December, the long and heavier rains in March - May. Mean monthly maximum temperatures are relatively uniform throughout the year being constant around 27 to 28 degrees centigrade (or 75 - 80 degrees Fahrenheit) at Seronera. At Ngorongoro Crater the nights can be very chilly due to altitude.\n\nAny time other than during the long rains in April and May is a perfect time to be on Safari in Northern Tanzania. Game viewing and the number of other tourists varies widely according to the seasonal concentrations of wildlife . Most Safari operators will adjust their itineraries accordingly.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThe nearest international airport to the Serengeti is Kilimanjaro Airport (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["JRO"]]},") ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.kilimanjaroairport.co.tz\/"]}," near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Arusha"]]},". KLM ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.klm.com"]}," is currently the only international airline that flies directly into Arusha (daily from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Amsterdam"]]},").

The distance is 325 km and the drive takes around eight hours. At Seronera and Lobo, garage facilities are available to refuel cars. Breakdown facilities, however, are virtually non-existent.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By plane:"]}," Internal flights by small aircrafts from Arusha to the Seronera Airstrip in the heart of Serengeti or to Kirawira Airstrip in the Western Corridor cost 135 US$ per person one way. The cost of charter flights varies widely. Limit your baggage to 10 - 15 kg (25 - 30 pounds) per person. It is advisable to carry your luggage in soft bags rather than hard sided suitcases.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\n\nPark fees can be very expensive in Tanzania. If you book your trip through a travel agent they are generally included in the overall trip cost.\nIn Serengeti National Park and Ngorongoro Conservation area the park fee is US$ 50 per person per day, for camping US$30 per tent per day and US$ 30 per vehicle per day.\nThere is a number of definite \"don'ts\" in the Serengeti. These include approaching too close and disturbing animals, making an unacceptable noise, picking flowers or destroying vegetation, discarding litter, exceeding 50km\/h speed limit, bringing pets or firearms into the Park, and going off the roads within 16km of Seronera.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Lake Lagarja\/Lake Masak, South Serengeti"]},"\n\nFrom December to May, depending on the rains, the large herds are concentrated on the low lying grass steppe between Olduvai, Gol, Naabi and Lagarja. A base on Lake Masak or Lake Lagarja is then ideal because one can travel from there in all directions.\nDay excursions take one into areas that are little known so that you can enjoy in peace an animal paradise: for example Hidden Valley, the Soito Ngum Kopjes or the Kakesio Plains. You will enjoy the freedom of travelling cross country in order to be able to find the best places and thus have the chance to see rarer animals such as honey-badgers, wild cats, porcupines. In the right season, Southern Serengeti is not to be surpassed.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Moru Kopjes and Seronera, Central Serengeti"]},"\n\nHere the savanna animals are joined by species that have adapted to living in the rocky cliffs. From here, or whilst in transit, you visit Seronera in the centre of the park searching for rare leopards and cheetahs. You can also enjoy the ever changing landscape with gallery forests, kopjes and water holes.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Lobo, North Serengeti"]},"\n\nThe North Serengeti is very different from the grassy plains in the South. As there is always water present the big herds retreat there in the dry season. In addition there are many species that live here permanently and you will also fairly regularly see elephants. A world for itself are the Bologonja Springs on the border to Kenya.\n'''\nThe 'Corridor', West Serengeti'''\n\nThis is a special area which is seldom offered on safari tours. Long distances, poor communications (few vehicles are equipped with a radio) and the frequently difficult road conditions still keep away most visitors from this part of the Serengeti which stretches almost as far as Lake Victoria. An important aspect of the Serengeti is therefore lost to them. This area is very different from the other main zones of the park. In the dry season large stretches of the route westward can be practically empty of animals. The last quarter of the route is however ideally suited to be the home for thousands of animals the whole year round. Gnus and zebras who are resident here do not join their migratory relatives who pass through every year on their way northwards.\nBig herds of giraffes, buffalo, eland, topis, kongonis, impalas, waterbuck and Thompson's gazelles live here together with them. All the big cats and hyenas are present in a good number as well.\nThe end of May through August is the time to view the annual migration of zebra and wildebeest in Western Serengeti. This is also the rut season for wildebeest and the plains are noisy with male wildebeest defending their temporary territories. \nA special attraction, that has become quite famous, is the crocodile population of the Grumeti River. This is particularly large at Kirawira, where the river does not dry up. The time spent at this life-giving water source can be among the most inter-esting. Here there are not only crocodiles and hippos to observe but also a large number of varieties of birds. Those tourists with a lot of time (or luck) will be able to discover the Black and White Colobus monkey in the crowns of the trees.\nOn the wooded savannahs of the Ndabaka plains there is always something to see. You will always feel at peace at the calm pools and mysterious \"korongos\".\nDuring your excursions in this least visited part of Serengeti, you can stay at the most luxurious and exclusive camp near Kirawira, the \"Kirawira Serena Camp\", at Conservation Corporation's \"Grumeti River Camp\" (also very exclusive!) or at the cheaper, but good and charming new Speke Bay Lodge right on the shore of Lake Victoria (4 km outside the park, an hour's drive from Kirawira). Mbalageti Serengeti ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.mbalageti.com Mbalageti Serengeti"]}," is also in the Western corridor and offers an unparalleled view over the vast plains due to its stellar location.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nTake photographs!  A good zoom and a large memory card make the results so good you'll be looking at the photos months and months later.  (Save them on high quality image and you can do amazing things with your photo program when you get home!)\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\nShopping in the Serengeti naturally is extremely limited due to the absence of human settlements. In Arusha, however, and other major towns you will find curio markets where you can buy all sorts of carvings, masks, Maasai spears, textiles, drums, tinga-tinga paintings, batik work, silk shawls, locally made jewelry, coffee, etc. The Arusha Heritage Centre offers a large variety of souvenirs and crafts. Also, The Sayari Camp had arrangements with locals to supply a little \"gift shop\" and the money goes right back into local programs.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Tipping "]},"\n\nTipping at restaurants (at your discretion) is 10%. We recommend tipping US$5 for each traveller per day at lodge based safaris; US$ 10 per day for your driver guide and US$5 each per day for the camp staff when camping on mobile safaris.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nEat fresh roasted cashews, drink watermelon juice, try the tiny sweet bananas or even the red bananas.\n\nMost visitors are surprised by the quality and the variety of the food available on safari. No matter whether you are staying in a lodge, a tented camp or a mobile safari camp, you will be served freshly prepared food according to international tastes and standards.\nBottled water can be purchased at all the lodges and camps and is provided by all Safari Operators. Non alcoholic drinks are often included in the all inclusive rates. It is wise to stick with bottled drinks.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nCoffee, bungo juice, Tusker lager, Amarula!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nIf you go on an organised Safari with a tour operator you will mostly sleep in mobile camps. Here facilities are more limited. The tents usually have simple beds with lining and duvets, camping toilets and showers depending on the Safari Operator.\n\nMany lodges and tented camps operate their own generators or solar lighting systems providing intermittent electricity.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Safari Lodges"]},"\nThe term and the concept of the Safari Lodge are of Tanzanian origin. Here you will find buildings of exciting design, specially build to fit in with the wild landscape of the parks, yet with all the amenities of a luxury hotel, such as swimming pools and fine food. As you eat, drink, laze by the pool or sit on your private veranda, you will be able to observe game, often at only a few yards distance.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Luxury Tented Camps"]},"\n\nThe are a few Luxury Tented Camps in the Serengeti offering an absolutely unique Safari experience. The tents usually offer fully equipped en-suite bathrooms, private verandas and elegant furniture.
