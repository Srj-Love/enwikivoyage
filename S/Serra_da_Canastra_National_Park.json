Very little is known about them besides the fact that they were annihilated by the first colonial scouts in the early 17th century. By the 18th century, taking advantage of the region's remoteness, escaping slaves founded many quilombos (independent hinterland communities) alongside the mountains and many descendants of these communities still live there today. In the 40s, the region saw a diamond rush, but the mining activity declined and was prohibited after the creation of the park.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Parque Nacional da Serra da Canastra 3.jpg"],["thumb"],["Casca D'Anta Falls"]]},"\nWith an original area of 715km2 comprising the municipalities of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["São Roque de Minas"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vargem Bonita"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Delfinópolis"]]}," and Sacramento, the national park was created in 1972 aiming the preservation of the water springs surrounding the Canastra Mountains and its fauna.
