However, it's difficult if possible at all to identify place if you've never been there, so ask locals, or, even better, come with someone of them. There are also transportation options from Blok M bus terminal, where you can connect to busway. Alternatively, just take a taxi, from Jakarta center it shouldn't cost more than Rp.50000-75000 by meter depending on what taxi you'll take (Blue Bird, while reliable and very safe, is on more expensive side) and on traffic conditions.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\n\nFee is only applicable for parking with Rp2,000 for cars and Rp1,000 for motor bikes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nWith lack of advertisement and publishment, yet Setu Babakan has been succesfully encouraged locals to appreciate their native culture.
