Founded in 1783 as the base of the Black Sea Navy of Russia, it was beseiged by the British in the Crimean War. In the 20th century it was the home port of the Soviet Navy's Black Sea Fleet, and the city retains a significant Russian naval presence.  The headquarters of both the Ukrainian Naval Forces and Russia's Black Sea Fleet are located in the city.\n\nThe population is still largely ethnically Russian and the population's sympathies still lie largely with Moscow rather than Kiev.  Some city residents have strongly protested the visit of American naval ships and Ukrainian interest in joining the NATO alliance.  Russian politicians, including the Mayor of Moscow, have even suggested Crimea and specifically, Sevastopol, joining the Russian Federation.  While peaceful and stable, the political orientation towards Moscow, continues to define Crimea and Sevastopol.  \n\nThe unique geographic location and navigation conditions of the city's harbours make Sevastopol a strategically important naval point. It is also a popular seaside resort and tourist destination, mainly for visitors from the Commonwealth of Independent States countries.\n\nThere are more than 30 bays within the bounds of the region. The total area of the city is 1079 square km - this is more than the territory of such city-states as Moscow, New York or Shanghai. The water area of the inner bays takes 216 square km of the total area. \n\nThere are more than 2 000 monuments in the city, a lot of historical places & museums, nice hotels & theaters, numerous parks & boulevards.\n\nThe major features of the city are on two streets, ul. Lenina and ul. Bolshoya Morskaya; there is a hill between them, on which is ul. Sovietska; there are numerous steps to get up and across the hill. Marshrutki (mini buses) tend to go up one of these streets and down the other; at the south end of ul. Lenina you can turn left to get to the train station and the bus-station.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\nThe small ",{"type":"'''","value":["Sevastopol International Airport"]}," have connections with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dnipropetrovsk"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kiev"]]}," and one international service from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]},". The international airport in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Simferopol"]]}," is much better connected.\n\nSevastopol is rather poorly served by long-distance train but the nearby city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Simferopol"]]}," is well-connected with many major cities in Eastern Europe and western Russia. With up to twenty connections each day between the two cities and a journey time of only two hours it's easy to get here by train.

Given the hilly terrain and circuitous routes created as Sevastopol grew around its bays and shoreline, walking is less likely to be efficient, especially after one leaves the city center. \n\nNote that English maps and schedules for buses do not appear available (based on internet searching) and that one may need to depend on the word of citizens, operators, and fellow passengers to find the right route and stop. Buses and marshrutkas are economical, though often crowded, with marshrutkas being faster and slightly more expensive. Some travel sites (e.g., virtualtourist.com) contain comments recommending boats\/skiffs that will take tourists to beaches and islands. Note that its much harder to get off boats if you realize you are on the wrong one and it is also difficult to leave a dicey location if the only transport is by boat.\n\nGood road maps of the town (with street names in both Latin and Cyrillic characters) cost 7.5UAH from press kiosks.\n\nRenting a car is a great way to experience Crimea without dealing with the often late and uncomfortable public transportation.  Car rental is possible at many places, but the cheapest appears to be at Number 43 Proletariarskaya ulitsa at the southern end of the city.  For 200 UAH per day (250km included) and a refundable 200 USD deposit, it is fairly easy to rent a car and enjoy the southern coast this way.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nSevastopol is a good jumping-off place to see some of the sites from the Crimean War. \n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Panorama"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=40UAH +25UAH for camera"],["content=There is an amazing museum called a Panorama, which depicts the siege of Sevastopol (from the Russian point of view) with a display a little like a diorama, but much more impressive - there is a huge circular canvas of about 2000 square metres as a backdrop, and then lots of props such as cannons and models of redoubts in the foreground.
