In October 2010 the price for the passage was 125 rupies. Schedules and routing need to be confirmed by phone.\n\nIt is also possible to take small boats from Mahe direct to La Digue, although departures can be unreliable, there is limited wet weather cover and the journey takes about 3 hours (but that's cheaper than an Indian Ocean Island cruise!)\n\nAs of June 2013, online bookings with live seat availability and e-ticketing are possible for Cat Cocos and Inter Island Ferry by Seychellesbookings.com ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/seychellesbookings.com"]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nDriving in Seychelles is on the ",{"type":"'''","value":["left"]}," side of the road. The roads on Mahe are low-traffic, mountaineous, narrow roads, so caution is generally advised.\n\nHaving a car is really a good idea and makes life much more simple. For as little as 100 rupees worth of gas you can see the entire island of Mahe in a couple of hours, including stops at beaches and whatever else catches your eye. There is free parking in 'downtown' Victoria on Mahe, and if you go with a B&B or self-catering option for accommodations its by far the easiest way to pick up groceries. A car will also allow you access to the stores where locals do their regular shopping, and the prices are more reasonable as compared to the small convenience stores along the beaches. \n\nThere is no substitute for running your vacation on your own schedule...\n\nYou can only rent on Mahé and Praslin. You can find a small car (e.g.: Hyundai Atos) for around €35-€45 per day, but keep in mind that renters must be at least 21 years old, have a valid driver's license, and have at least three years of driving experience. There are several car hire counters outside the arrivals hall at Mahe international airport, which provide a convenient way to compare prices from different hire companies. Prices can be negotiated, with the better rate available for rental periods of 3 consecutive days or more. The 'excess' payable by the customer in the event of a claim, ranges from €300 to €1000  depending on the company, so choose carefully and ask the right questions.\n\nTaxis are also popular means of transportation for both short trips and day rental and can be obtained almost anywhere. Taxi prices for non-residents (approx. 20 rupees\/1.3Euros per km at Sept 2010) on a relatively long trip, can easily exceed the cost of hiring a small car for a day.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nSeychelles Public Transport Corporation (SPTC) runs daily bus services on the islands of Praslin and Mahe from morning to evening on nearly every available road on the island. The bus usually passes by every 15 minutes. On Mahe you can easily use the SPTC bus to travel to and from the airport so long as you have local currency in small bills.\n\nAlthough the bus will get you there, the schedules aren't tight and the drivers are a bit bold on the very narrow roads if you're a nervous passenger.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nLanguages spoken in the Seychelles are ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Seychellois Creole phrasebook"],["Seychellois Creole"]]},", English and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["French"]]},".

Many of the beaches are seemingly untouched by human influence and are refreshingly uncrowded. They offer clear blue skies and a tranquility you will rarely find. A hike along the coastline from Beau Vallon to Anse Major will take about 1.5-2 hours and your reward will be a small deserted beach that's fit for a king. The scenery along the hike is breath-taking. Not all beaches are suitable for swimming depending on the time of year, due to the seasonal winds.

Explore on the board of a yacht, power boat, catamaran or sailboat. Windsurfing is also popular and the best time for this activity is usually around May and October, at the start and end of the trade winds. \n\nScuba diving, snorkeling, and fishing are also extremely popular and can be done almost anywhere in Seychelles. Baie Ternay is superb and easily accessible by glass bottom boat tour from Beau Vallon beach - leave yourself an empty day and walk the beach for a 'last minute' booking - great deals can be bartered. Snorkeling (provided you have your own gear - some hotels lend masks, snorkels and fins to guests) is FREE and there are many great spots: off some of the small beaches at Glacis, past Mouse Island at Anse Royale, along the reef at Port Launay (near Ephelia Resort). Often spotted are a wide array of tropical fish, sea turtles, eagle rays and more!\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Land Sports"]},": Golf, tennis, squash, badminton, horseback riding, biking and hiking are some of the recreational activities available on the Seychelles Islands. Bike rentals and walking tours are great ways to sightsee and since distances are relatively short and the scenery is beautiful, walking is probably the best way to see the smaller islands (La Digue, Praslin), while walking along the main road can be quite intimidating as the roads are narrow and local cars\/busses drive quite quickly. On Mahe it is not advised to ride bicycles, and there are no rental shops within sight. Bird watching is also popular and the islands are home to many of the worlds most treasured and rare species of animals.  The best place to do so is Cousin Island which although only 1 km (0.6 miles) in diameter, is home to more than 300,000 birds, but many unique species can be found at ease on Mahe. \n\nSeychelles also has numerous markets, art galleries and shops, colonial Creole-style plantation houses, and the main island of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mahé"]]}," has six museums, a botanical garden, and several national monuments.

Primary education is followed by five years of secondary education. Seychelles does not provide education at university level, but there is a teacher training college and a polytechnic institute, and as mentioned above, the University of Seychelles - American Institute of Medicine does exist.  Because of the absence of higher education facilities, many students study abroad, mostly in the United Kingdom.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Work"]},"\n\nWorking and doing business in the Seychelles can be difficult due to the humidity and heat. Forget about wearing a suit or anything resembling one; rather, opt for a light cotton shirt and pants. The atmosphere in the Seychelles is relaxed and it can take a lot of effort to achieve very little. \n\nTourism is one of the most important sectors of the economy. In fact, about 15 percent of the work force is directly employed in tourism, and employment in banking, transportation, construction, and other activities is closely tied to the tourist industry.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nThe islands' currency is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Seychelles rupee"]}," (SCR).  ATM machines usually have the best conversion rates; however, airports and banks also conveniently exchange money.\n\nTrading in foreign currency, long illegal, was legalized in November 2008, and the currency freely floated. This has also wiped out the previously widespread black market, which used to offer up to twice the official rate. The £ buys around 21-22 Rupees on Jan 2012. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Shopping"]},"\nThe best place for shopping is Victoria, the capital, and more specifically the market at the city centre, Seychelles Buy and Sell ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.seybay.com\/"]},". There are also a few outlets on the island, Praslin, but few shopping areas on the other islands. Larger hotels have boutiques but shopping in Seychelles is not one of the major attractions. \n\nWhile visiting, be sure to buy the classic and traditional Seychelles souvenir, the coco-de-mer, or the 'nut of the sea,' a nut from trees native to the islands in the Seychelles - but this requires an export licence. Other locally made souvenirs, although not as unique, can be purchased like sea shell and pearl jewellery, textiles and straw hats, in addition to needlework & crochet, paintings by local artists and woodwork.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Tipping"]},"\nMost service providers already include a service charge of 5% - 10%. Tipping is not obligatory in the Seychelles; however, any extra change is greatly appreciated.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nSeychellois cuisine has been greatly influenced by the islands' rich cultures. Creole cooking, varied seafood dishes, coconuts and curries are the most popular.   The main product of the country, fish, is cooked in a variety of ways. Especially the red snapper is very tasty and well known to visitors. \n\nThere are restaurants that serve Chinese, Indian and Italian food as well as local cuisine.\n\nCheapest food: Collect coconuts on the beach and learn how to open their terrible cover (not the shell, that's easy; they have a thick cover of natural fibres; to open it: hit the coconut very strongly many times on the edges, sooner or later the fibres break up).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nSeychelles offers a fantastic nightlife scene that caters to tourists. The active nightlife is mostly located around the larger hotels and in addition to theatres, cinemas and discos, there are numerous fun and trendy restaurants.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Nightlife"]},": Do not miss most popular Nightclub \"Lovenut\" in the centre of Victoria, 100 metres walk from central Taxi station. Also entertaining are \"Tequila Boom\" at (Bel Ombre) and \"Katiolio\" (near Anse Royale) night clubs. \"Katiolio\" was one of the first nightclubs to open on Mahe and boats an open-air that is directly beside the ocean.\n\nIf you enjoy a good beer you must try the local Seybrew beer, it tastes similar to a light Bavarian style beer and is a must to get you through those balmy days. You can save yourself a packet buying the beer from stores on the side of the road like the locals do rather than from hotels. \nA dark Takamaka Rum on the beach under the stars is the best way to end a day on the Seychelles.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nThe Seychelles are not tolerant of backpackers turning up at the airport without accommodation booked. In such a situation, you will likely be taken to a counter where you will have to book & pay for accommodation for the duration of your trip before being allowed through immigration. Visitors need to provide details of their accommodation on their landing card (Hotel Name, address, phone number), and additionally, being questioned by the immigration officer about their accommodation details (\"Is your booking at hotel <x> confirmed?\" etc..) That said, booking a room by email from listings found on the internet is easy.\n\nMost accommodations are relatively expensive and some islands have only one hotel. In fact, some of the islands aren't even permanently inhabited and accommodation can be found on fewer than 10. Your best bet for a budget bed is renting an apartment or bungalow, which are available at better rates.  Also keep in mind that hotel prices greatly increase and accommodation can be hard to find during the peak seasons from December to January and July to August. Holidays such as Easter can also get very busy.\n\nMost resorts can be found on the main islands of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mahe"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Praslin"]]},".  A few (very) high end ones, like the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Island (Seychelles)"],["North Island"]]},", have their own private islands. Additionally, you will find an array of 'small hotels' which can be ideal as a get-together venue with that special feeling of exclusiveness.\n\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nTry to avoid any dark lanes, and always be careful not to leave your bag unattended. Swimming alone on isolated beaches is not advisable. If you sail, avoid bringing valuables; if you have no choice, become adept at finding great hiding places.   \n\nThere is some sketchy activity along a shady secondary road behind Beau Vallon beach (left from the Boathouse restaurant) on Mahé, but locals mostly seem content to admire their flashy cars and mostly ignore passers-by.\n\nThere are newly instituted tourist police stationed at every beach on Mahé and are easily recognizable by their blue or white golf shirts, with a tourist police badge sewn on. They are very friendly and more than willing to help keep a good eye, even though you may not see them. They are honest and freely offer advice. Potential thieves are obvious (mostly due to lurking and just stand out from the locals) and tend to hide just off the beach or across the narrow streets near more out of the way beaches. Jail terms are stiff and are strictly enforced since the island makes lots of money from tourism.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\nChikungunya virus is a disease spread by mosquitoes, and causes flu-like symptoms. It is increasing in concern and although it is rare to die from it, the joint pain it causes can last for months. Insect repellent can help deter mosquitoes but not much else can be done as a precaution. The disease is native to East Africa and occasionally is introduced and quickly eradicated.\n\nTap water is safe to drink in most areas of the Seychelles, but water quality is variable in undeveloped areas.
