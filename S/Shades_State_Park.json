Just 10 minutes down the road from Turkey Run, Shades boasts many of the same types of sandstone features as Turkey Run on a smaller scale but in a more natural, secluded location.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nShades was originally home to Native Americans, specifically offshoots of the Miami tribe. In the late 1820's settlers arrived after the area was ceded to the US government by the Miami's. Due to the poor soil and distinct land topography the area was not used for farming, maintaining its beautiful environment.\n\nMany tales of Indian battles and ghostly creatures called \"shades\" haunting the area are legendary tales of the park. The title of \"The Shades of Death\" for these little ghostly shades gave the park its name.  Since the park name \"The Shades of Death\" wasn't too positive, they changed it to \"The Shades.\" \n\nGovernment surveys in the early 1800's showed a series of natural springs. Before becoming a park the land was purhcased by the Garland Dells Mineral Springs to be used as a health resort and recreation area called \"The Shades.\" In 1887 they built a 40 room inn, and the land was preserved. Eventually, through a series of business transactions, in 1947 the business and land was purchased by a holding company and they held a public campaign called \"Save the Shades.\" They raised enough funds, and the land became the 15th state park, saved from timber cutters who wanted to use the oak trees for whiskey barrels.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\nThe park landscape is quite beautiful. Sugar Creek heads through the park, making canoeing an popular sport. Waterfalls, sandstone cliffs, streams, steep climbs and lots of trails. A constant evolution takes place at Shades due to the easy moldability of the sandstone rock found throughout the park along the river.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\nThe area is considered one of the most prime bird-watch areas in Indiana, according to the Audubon Society. Oaks, western hemlocks, white pines and Canada yew follow Sugar Creek. A large selection of Warblers live in the area - Worm Eating, Black throated Green, Kentucky, Cerulean, and Magnolia's. The area is a migratory path for thrushes and veros. Bald eagles can even be seen in the area. Other animals that are common are white tailed deer, raccoons, grey squirrel, chipmunks, wild turkey, fox, coyote and other common Midwestern beasts.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nWinters in the area are moderate, summers are slightly humid and fairly warm.
