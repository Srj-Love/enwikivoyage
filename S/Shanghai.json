By the early 20th century, Shanghai was the largest and most prosperous city in the Far East, and one of the wildest. With the opening up of China in the past few decades, Shanghai has regained much of its former glory and has surpassed it in many ways; the pace of development in recent years has been absolutely furious. Today, Shanghai is back to being one of the largest and most prosperous cities in Asia, though not nearly as wild as it once was. It is now a very attractive city for travellers from all over the world, and a major destination for both tourism and business. A ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/andrewbender\/2013\/06\/07\/bangkok-tops-the-worlds-10-most-visited-cities\/ Forbes article"]}," ranks Shanghai as the world's 14th most visited city, with 6.5 million visitors in 2012. \n\nShanghai is definitely a cosmopolitan city by Chinese standards, although it is less diverse than many western cities. The population was 23 million as of the 2010 census; 9 million (almost 40%) of those were migrants, people from elsewhere in China who have come to find work or to attend one of Shanghai's many educational institutions. There is also a substantial international contingent; 208,300 foreigners lived in Shanghai as of 2010, slightly over a third of the national total of 594,000. There are services that cater to these markets — restaurants with food from anywhere in China for the migrants (in particular, lots of good cheap Sichuan food and West-of-China noodles) and a good range of grocery stores, restaurants and bars that cater to the foreigners.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Districts"]},"\n\nShanghai is split in two by the Huangpu River (黄浦江 ",{"type":"''","value":["Huángpǔ Jiāng"]},"), into ",{"type":"'''","value":["Puxi"]}," (浦西 ",{"type":"''","value":["Pǔxī"]},") west of the river and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Pudong"]}," (浦东 ",{"type":"''","value":["Pǔdōng"]},") east of the river.

Shanghai's other airport, Hongqiao, ranks fourth. The city is also very well connected by both road and rail.\n\nShanghai is also one of the main industrial centers of China, and the municipal government has set up a number of industrial zones to encourage additional development. 2011 GDP was $300 million, which is actually just ahead of the entire country of Malaysia.\n\nThere is a saying that goes, \"Shanghai is heaven for the rich, hell for the poor.\" People from all over China flock to Shanghai — everyone from farmers seeking jobs in manual labour to university graduates seeking to start a career or wanting to live in a cool up-tempo city. About 40% of the population, 9 million out of 23, are migrants from other parts of China. Real estate prices, especially in central areas, have skyrocketed in the past few years; rental prices are among the highest in China and even well-off people complain that buying a home is becoming impossible.\n\nThe surrounding ",{"type":"[[","value":[["East China"]]}," region is populous, prosperous, highly developed, and still growing. Shanghai plays an important role as the center of that region.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" History "]},"\n\nWhile the area has been inhabited since prehistoric times and there has been a town at least since the Song Dynasty, a thousand years or so ago, Shanghai only rose to prominence after China lost the First Opium War in 1842.

Most of these were jointly administered as the \"International Settlement\", but the French ran theirs separately. In all of them, the population was mainly Chinese, but the legal system was foreign and the police included many Sikhs and French gendarmes. They were located north of the Chinese walled city. Today all these areas are considered parts of downtown Shanghai.\n\nHistory has shaped Shanghai's cityscape significantly. British-style buildings can still be seen on The Bund, while French-style buildings are still to be found in the former French Concession. What was once a racetrack on the edge the British area is now People's Park, with a major metro interchange underneath. Other metro stops include the railway station at the edge of what was once the American area, and Lao Xi Men and Xiao Nan Men, Old West Gate and Small South Gate respectively, named for two of the gates of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai\/Old City"],["old Chinese walled city"]]},". The wall is long gone but that area still has quite a few traditional Chinese-style buildings and Yuyuan Gardens.\n\nShanghai has sometimes had groups of refugees arrive from other parts of the world. One group were White Russians fleeing the 1917 revolution; in the 1920s the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai\/French Concession"],["French Concession"]]}," had more Russians than French (and of course more Chinese than both of those together). Another group were Jews getting out of Germany in the 1930s; they mainly settled in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai\/Hongkou"],["Hongkou"]]},", a district that already had many Jews.\n\nShanghai reached its zenith in 1920s and 30s and was at that time the most prosperous city in East Asia. On the other hand, the streets were largely ruled by the triads (Chinese gangs) during that period, with the triads sometimes battling for control over parts of Shanghai. That period has been greatly romanticised in many modern films and television serials, one of the most famous being ",{"type":"''","value":["The Bund"]},", which was produced by Hong Kong's TVB in 1980. Shanghai also became the main center of Chinese entertainment during that period, with many films and songs produced in Shanghai.\n  \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Shanghai1937city zhabei fire.jpg"],["thumb"],[{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai\/Zhabei"],["Zhabei"]]}," burning during Battle of Shanghai, 1937"]]},"\nShanghai was occupied by the Japanese in 1937 after a bitter battle lasting several months. (See ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Burma Road"]]}," for a discussion of its military significance.) They remained in control until 1945 and, as elsewhere in China, life in Shanghai at that time was very tough.\n\nThe foreign concessions were removed after the war, and trade resumed. After the Communist victory in the civil war in 1949, many of the people involved in the entertainment industry and many business people fled to Hong Kong and Taiwan. Shanghai's days of glory were — temporarily as it turned out — over.\n\nSince China's \"reform and opening up\", starting under Deng Xiaoping around 1978, Shanghai has been moving back toward its former role as a great industrial city and trading port, and in many ways even surpassing the old glory days. In the 1990s, the Shanghai government launched a series of new strategies to attract foreign investment. The biggest move was to open up ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai\/Pudong"],["Pudong"]]}," as a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["List_of_Chinese_provinces_and_regions#Development_zones"],["Special Economic Zone"]]}," with a range of government measures to encourage investment. The strategies for growth have been extremely successful; in twenty years Pudong went from a predominantly rural area to having more skyscrapers than New York, including the World Financial Center, fourth-tallest in the world. Pudong is now home to many financial institutions which used to have their main offices across the Huangpu river on the Bund.\n\nToday, Shanghai's goal is to develop into a world-class financial and economic center, and it is already well on its way. In achieving this goal, Shanghai faces competition from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong"]]},", which has the advantage of a stronger legal system and greater banking and service expertise. However, Shanghai has stronger links to the Chinese interior and to the central government in addition to a stronger manufacturing and technology base.

The card can be used once after it runs out of money; up to a ¥8 \"overdraft\" is allowed.\n\nCards come in several sizes — regular (credit card size), mini, and \"strap\" (for hanging on mobile phones) — and special editions with interesting pictures are available for each.

There are also one-day cards available which can be purchased for ¥18, good for 24 hours after their first use.

Fares depend on distance and conductors rarely have any English, so you must either know your destination and be able to pronounce it in Chinese or have it written down in Chinese characters.\n\nOther buses do not have a conductor, only the driver; there is a fixed price for the route, usually ¥2 if the buses are air-conditioned and ¥1.5 on increasingly rare routes running on old buses without. Check the bus itself as some routes the fare is different from bus to bus; typically there is a sign showing the fare on the outside next to the door and\/or on the fare box. Exact fare is required unless you have a metro pass; prepare exact change beforehand and drop it into the box next to the driver.\n\nIf you change buses with a metro card, you get a ¥1 discount on your second bus fare and all subsequent transfers.

As a foreigner you can try to learn how to use these apps if you can read Chinese."]]},"\nTaxi drivers typically do not speak any English, so unless you speak Mandarin or Shanghainese, be sure to have your destination written in Chinese characters to show the driver. Get a business card for your hotel or any restaurant or shop you like; that makes it easy to return there. As Shanghai is a huge city, try to get the nearest intersection to your destination as well since even addresses in Chinese are often useless. If you have a mobile phone, you can also use the phone number displayed in the back of the taxi. Dial the number and tell the agent in English where you want to go. Hand the phone to the driver and the agent will tell him in Chinese where you wish to go. The agent will even find out the address of bars and other spots for you if required.\n\nTry to avoid using ¥100 bills to pay for short rides; either use a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Metro cards"],["metro card"]]}," or have change available; taxi drivers are not keen on giving away their change. Also, the ¥50 note is a favorite of counterfeiters and a foreigner unfamiliar with the money is an obvious person to foist a bad one on, so you should try to avoid getting a fifty in your change.\n\nTaxis are very hard to come by during peak hours and when it's raining so be prepared to wait for a while or walk to a busy pick-up location. Foreign visitors might be surprised at the almost compete lack of courtesy or lines while waiting for a taxi, so don't be afraid to \"jump in\" and get one — it's first come, first served.  There are some taxi stops where attendants maintain a well-ordered line; this may be the fastest way to get a taxi in a busy part of town, but there are not very many of them, so expect to walk a ways to get to one.\n\nDrivers, while generally honest, are sometimes genuinely clueless and occasionally out to take you for a ride. The drivers are very good about using the meter but in case they forget, remind them. It's also the law to provide a receipt for the rider but if your fare seems out of line, be sure to obtain one as it's necessary to receive any compensation. If you feel you have been cheated or mistreated by the driver, you (or a Chinese-speaking friend) can use the information on the printed receipt to raise a complaint to the taxi company about that particular driver. The driver will be required to pay 3x the fare if ordered by the taxi company so normally they're very good about taking the appropriate route. The printed receipt is also useful to contact the driver in case you have forgotten something in the taxi and need to get it back.\n\nIf you come across a row of parked taxis and have a choice of which one to get in to, you may wish to check the driver's taxi ID card, posted near the meter on the dashboard. The higher the number, the newer the driver, so there may be more chance that the driver will not know where he or she is going. Those with numbers between 10XXXX and 12XXXX are the most experienced drivers; a number above 27XXXX indicates a new driver who may get you lost somewhere. Another way is to check the number of stars the driver has; these are displayed below the driver's photograph on the dashboard. The number of stars indicates the length of time the driver has been in the taxi business and the level of positive feedback received from customers, and range from zero stars to five. Drivers with one star or more should know all major locations in Shanghai, and those with three stars should be able to recognize even lesser-known addresses. Remember that it takes time to build up these stars, and so don't panic if you find yourself with a driver who doesn't have any — just have them assure you that they know where they are going and you should be fine.\n\nIf you need to cross from one side of the Huangpu River to the other by taxi, especially from Pudong to Puxi, you may want to make sure your driver will make the trip, and knows where he or she is going; some drivers only know their side of the town and may become lost once they cross the river. Taxis are notoriously difficult to get on rainy days and during peak traffic hours, so plan your journeys accordingly. As the crossings between Pudong and Puxi are often jammed with traffic, taking a taxi may be more expensive and slower than the metro. It may be better to take the metro across the river and then catch a taxi.\n\nTaxi colors in Shanghai are strictly controlled and indicate the company the taxi belongs to. Turquoise taxis operated by ",{"type":"''","value":["Dazhong"]}," (大众), the largest group, are often judged the best of the bunch. Another good taxi company, ",{"type":"''","value":["Qiangsheng"]}," (强生), uses gold-colored taxis. The other large companies include ",{"type":"''","value":["Jinjiang"]}," (锦江), which uses white taxis and ",{"type":"''","value":["Bashi"]}," (巴士), which uses light green taxis. Watch out for dark red\/maroon taxis, since this is the 'default' color of small taxi companies and includes more than its fair share of bad apples. Also private owned taxis (You can recognize them easily as they have an 'X' in their number plate and may not be the standard Volkswagen Santana used by most taxi companies) are among them. The dark red\/maroon taxis will also go \"off the meter\" at times and charge rates 4x-5x the normal rate — especially around the tourist areas of the Yuyuan Gardens. Bright red taxis and blue taxis, on the other hand, are unionized and quite OK, furthermore there are more 3-star and above taxi drivers working for these companies. The bright orange taxis cover suburban areas only and are not allowed within the \"city\" area, but their meters start at ¥11 and count at ¥2.4\/km no matter how long the journey so they're somewhat cheaper if you're not trying to get downtown (rule of thumb — if you're trying to go somewhere within the Outer Ring highway, don't get one, but if your journey ends just within it you may be able to find a driver willing to bend the rules). Also of note is the \"Expo taxis\" — the Volkswagen Tourans and Buick Lacrosses. Those are the only taxis allowed to travel to the Expo area. Nowadays it's a gamble whether you get one or not; most companies don't have a way to separately ask for one when making a phone booking, so don't rely on having one.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["On foot"]},"\n\nShanghai is a good city for walking, especially in the older parts of the city such as the Bund, but be aware this city is incredibly dynamic and pavements can be obstructed or unpleasant to walk through when near construction areas. If there is a metro entry at a busy street, the station can usually be used as a pedestrian underpass to another metro exit across the way.\n\nSome distances in Shanghai are huge, so you will need to use other means of transportation at some point. However, quite a few people navigate well with just a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Metro_cards"],["metro pass"]]}," plus their feet and perhaps the occasional taxi.\n\nSee ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Do"]]}," below for some suggested walks that combine shopping and sightseeing.\n\nThe Bund \"sightseeing tunnel\" is very strange, and doesn't actually show you any sites of the city at all.

Motorbikes and bicycles rarely use headlights and can come from any direction. They are the main users of curb-cuts for sidewalks, so don't stand at these. Avoid unpredictable movements while walking and crossing streets: the drivers see you and predict your future location from your speed.

The ferry is air-conditioned and allows foot-passengers only (bikes are not allowed except for folding models). Buy a token from the ticket kiosk and then insert it into the turnstile to enter the waiting room — the boats run every 10 minutes and take just over 5 minutes to cross the river. This is a great (and much cheaper) alternative to using the Bund Sightseeing Tunnel. However, the ferry stations are not directly connected to the public transport so you need to walk a bit.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bicycle"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Shanghai bicycle.JPG"],["thumb"],["Cyclist peddling past cars stopped by impromptu maintenance"]]},"\n\nFor locals, bicycles are slowly being eclipsed by electric scooters but they still remain an easy means of transportation for visitors who may be hesitant to communicate with drivers or board crowded mass transit — or simply to soak up some sunshine.  Go to Baoshan Metro station and get a vintage bicycle for approx ¥300; they are also easily found for sale on the street around Suzhou Creek or in the residential part of the old town.\nBeware of the driving habits of locals: the biggest vehicles have the priority and a red light does not mean you are safe to cross the street.\nBicycles and mopeds are not allowed on many major roads (signs designate this), or in the tunnels and on the bridges between Pudong and Puxi (the only way to cross is by ferry).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By motor vehicle "]},"\n\nDriving is definitely not recommended in Shanghai for a variety of reasons, even for those with driving experience in the country. Not only do you have to cope with a very complex road system and seemingly perpetual traffic jams, but also Chinese driving habits and ongoing construction. In addition, parking spaces are rare and almost impossible to find. Bicycles, scooters and pedestrians are also all over the place — a city with a real metropolitan feel. It is also not unheard of for cyclists, motorcyclists or pedestrians to suddenly dash in front of a car without any warning. In short, do not drive if you can help it and make use of Shanghai's excellent public transportation network instead.\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["seealso"],["Driving in China"]]},"\n\nWhilst motorcycle rental is practically non-existent, for long-term visitors ",{"type":"'''","value":["e-bikes and scooters"]}," are a cheap, fast, practical way of getting around. E-bikes don't require a driving license and are cheaper, but only have a short battery range (about 50 km) and a low top speed, and are a frequent target of thieves. A cheap e-bike can be picked up from any major supermarket — expect to pay around ¥1500-2500 for a new model. Small shops also sell converted e-bikes (motor scooters converted to run on electricity) which are more expensive but are faster, more comfortable and have longer battery ranges. 50cc motorcycles require registration but don't require a drivers license, whilst anything bigger will require a driving license. Motorcycles can be bought from used-bike dealers mostly located in residential working-class neighbourhoods — a used 50cc moped will be about ¥2000 whilst a 125cc will cost a lot more depending on condition and mileage. If you plan on riding a motorcycle, stick to automatic transmission scooters as they are much easier to ride in dense traffic than a manually-geared bike.\n\nMotorcycles are expected to use the bicycle lane and cross intersections via pedestrian traffic lights, which is often quicker when car traffic reaches a standstill. Be careful, particularly at night, of people riding with their headlights off or riding on the wrong side of the road — remember that e-bikes don't require any driving license and therefore drivers often flout traffic laws and take creative but dangerous paths through traffic. Parking is easy — most sidewalks serve as bike-parking, although in quiet streets you may risk getting your bike stolen so make sure you have a couple of good locks. At busy places there are attended bike parks that charge around ¥0.5-1 per day.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Vintage motorbikes with sidecars"]}," are used by mainly by expats and tourists.  Most expatriates and Shanghainese are too embarrassed to use what many consider a particularly \"uncool\" form of transport.\nChangjiang sidecars were used by the Chinese army until 1997. There are a few sidecar owners club in Shanghai (Black Bats, People's Riders Club), shops (Yiqi, Cao, Fan, Jack, Jonson, Leo) and a tour operator (",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.shanghaisideways.com Shanghai Sideways"]},") which are worth checking out. See also ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Driving_in_China#Sidecar rigs"],["Driving in China — Sidecar rigs"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nFor many visitors the ",{"type":"'''","value":["language barrier"]}," is likely to be the great obstacle, as English ability tends to be very limited in all but the largest tourist draws and establishments that cater specifically to foreign visitors.\n\nThe native language of most locals, Shanghainese or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wu phrasebook"],["Wu dialect"]]},", is not mutually intelligible with Mandarin, Cantonese, Minnan (Taiwanese\/Hokkien) or any other forms of Chinese. The use of Shanghainese as the de facto 'first' language of the city has been discouraged by the government and its use is decreasing both due to the effect of the use of Mandarin in mass media and because Shanghai has many migrant workers from other parts of China who do not speak Shanghainese and, as elsewhere in China, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chinese phrasebook"],["Mandarin"]]}," is the ",{"type":"''","value":["lingua franca"]},". As Shanghai has been China's main commercial centre since the 1920s, all locals who can speak Shanghainese can also speak Mandarin, so you will have no problems speaking Mandarin to locals. Nevertheless, attempts to speak Shanghainese are appreciated, and can help endear you to local people.\n\nWhile you are more likely to encounter an English speaker in Shanghai than in most mainland Chinese cities, they are still not widespread so it would be wise to have your destinations and hotel address written in Chinese so that taxi drivers can take you to your intended destination. Though most younger people will have studied English in school, due to a lack of practice, few are conversant. Likewise, if you are planning to bargain at shops, a calculator would be useful. That said, staff at the more expensive hotels, major tourist attractions and other establishments catering specifically to foreigners generally speak an acceptable level of English.\n\nWu speakers have a particular accent when speaking Mandarin. Mandarin is heavily tone-based and speakers from Beijing can easily be understood (most textbooks are based on their accent or an approximation). Shanghainese speakers have appropriated some of the features of Wu onto their Mandarin. While in other languages this would not be a problem, given the phonemic and tonal nature inherent to Mandarin, the slightest shift in pronunciation can make it much more difficult to understand. The best thing to do is say \"说慢一点\" (shuō màn yī diǎn) which means \"speak a little slower\".\n\nRudimentary Chinese and\/or pattern matching ability for character recognition will help, as will getting your destination and some simple directions to it written in Chinese characters, particularly when traveling by taxi. Some taxi drivers know English, but many and not much. Do not waste time and confuse someone with limited English by using difficult grammatical constructions and pleasantries such as \"Oh I was wondering if you could help me find...\" Just say \"The Bund\" (wai tan) or \"Nanjing West\" (nanjing xi lu). Though it may seem rude to an English speaker, this is exactly how Chinese would say it in Mandarin and is much more effective.\n\nHowever, with the opening-up policy, the situation has been improved. As English is compulsory in Chinese schools, an increasing number of younger people know some basic English. If you are lost, try approaching younger people, such as students and stick to basic phrases; they might be able to point you in the right direction.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nWhere to go in Shanghai depends largely on your time period and interests. \n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Yuyuan gardens, Shanghai.JPG"],["thumb"],["Teahouse in the old town"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Central areas "]},"\nMany of Shanghai's main tourist sights are in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai\/Huangpu"],["Huangpu District"]]},":\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai\/Old City"],["Old City"]]}]}," (南市; Nanshi) is the original Chinese city going back about 1000 years, now a major tourist area.

If you're searching for computer or business related books, head to the biggest store in Fuzhou Rd: Shanghai Book Town (上海书城). You'll find special editions targeted at the Chinese market. The only difference to the original version is the Chinese cover and the heavily reduced price. Fuzhou Road is also a good street to wander around and find stationery and Chinese calligraphy related shops.\n\nThose interested in music CDs or DVDs of movies and television shows have a wide variety of options. The bookstores all carry some, people sell DVDs out of boxes on street corners, and there are local DVD shops in most neighborhoods. Costs go from about ¥6 per disk to about ¥40; you pay a bit more for DVD-9 format disks. See also discussion in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China#Software.2C_music_and_movies"],["China article"]]},".\n\nThere are also some shops popular with the expatriate community; these tend to have English-speaking staff and a better selection of things that appeal to Westerners, though sometimes at slightly higher prices. One is the Ka De Club with two shops: one at 483 Zhenning Rd and the other one at 505 Da Gu Rd (a small street between Weihai and Yan'an Rds). Another popular DVD shop is on ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai\/French_Concession#Hengshan_Road"],["Hengshan Road"]]}," about halfway between two expat bars, Oscar's and the Brewery.\n\nPerhaps the best way to score a deal with a shop is to be a regular.

As in any major city, more-or-less everything is available somewhere, including high-end items of interest mainly to professionals and unusual things that only a collector might want. Some of the older stuff is rare here because China was relatively isolated when it was being made, but Shanghai was a very prosperous and cosmopolitan city in the 1930s so some collector's items are now in good supply.\n\nAs a general rule, prices on photo equipment in Shanghai are roughly comparable to US prices and a bit higher than Hong Kong, but there are various exceptions including some real bargains and some seriously overpriced items. Check prices abroad before making any major purchases.\n\nFor consumer products such as point-and-shoot cameras or low-end interchangeable lens devices, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["French_Concession#Xujiahui"],["Xujiahui"]]}," is a shopper's paradise. Any of the large consumer electronics stores scattered around the city, and many of the general department stores, will have these as well, but selection and price are usually better at Xujiahui.\n\nFor more specialised needs, there are two large buildings full of camera stores in Shanghai. Both have plenty of consumer products, usually at good prices. However they also have lots of products for the enthusiast and professional markets, services such as printing or camera repair, and a large selection of used equipment from cheap-and-usable to collector's items.\n\nOne is Huanlong Photographic Equipment City (环龙照相器材) on the 2nd through 5th floor of a building near the Shanghai train station in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai\/Zhabei"],["Zhabei District"]]},". Come out of the station into the South Square, and the building is diagonally left. Burger King on ground floor, KFC, ... Second floor and above is mostly camera shops. The higher you go, the more used equipment you see.\n\nAn even larger clump of shops is Xing Guang Photographic Equipment City (星光摄影器材城) 300 Luban Lu, corner of Xietu Lu. Metro line 4 to Luban Road South, go out exit 1, turn left onto Luban Lu, and you are walking North. Xietu Lu is the first cross street. The camera center is on the NW corner. It has 7 floors. The top one is offices, bottom two mostly new cameras. One floor (4th?) is mostly studio equipment — lights, reflectors and so on — and includes some unusual cameras such as 4 by 5 inch view cameras and 6 by 17 cm Chinese-made panoramic cameras. Another (5th?) is mostly wedding studios, wedding clothes rental, etc. Used equipment anywhere from 2nd to 6th, and dominating a couple of floors. One camera repair shop, a few accessories shops — memory, bags, tripods, etc.\n\nThere are two newer buildings next to the main one. As of early 2010, only two floors of one of those had opened; everything else was under construction. Everything that was open was print shops or wedding-related services.\n\nIn the main building, the bottom two floors are nearly all shops selling new cameras, with much specialisation by brand. At least one shop with nothing but Canon, some only Sony, one only Nikon & Manfrotto. Two mainly Pentax. Olympus & Panasonic fairly common, but no shops selling only those. Voigtlander visible here and there.\n\nThese two groups of shops are both on line 4 so it is easy to visit both in a day. However, line 4 is roughly circular and they are on opposite edges (Railway Station on North, Luban Lu on South) so it is a fairly long ride between them.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Clothing"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:上海七浦路.jpg"],["thumb"],["Qipu Road"]]},"\nThe horrendously crowded ",{"type":"'''","value":["Qipu Lu"]}," clothing market (Tiantong Road metro station on line 10, one stop North of Nanjing Road East) is the main place where Shanghai people look for cheap clothing.

For example, the top floor of the building by the subway has a women's clothing place specialising in silk dresses and tops, including many with good embroidery. Prices start around ¥300, high but not outrageous by Chinese standards. Compared to prices in Western countries they are a real bargain.\n\nThere are a number of other markets which combine cheap clothing (including lots of knock-offs of famous brands) with tourist stuff like souvenir T-shirts and higher-grade Chinese stuff like silk (?) scarves and robes. In any of these there are quite a few touts; just walking in to the buildings can bring a horde of people upon you trying to sell you bags, watches, DVDs and all sorts of goods. You also need to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["haggle"]]}," to get good prices in any of them. Dodging touts and haggling can be fun, but those sensitive to the pressure might want to steer clear.\n\nThe largest of those is next to the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Shanghai Science & Technology Museum"]}," (上海科技馆) metro station on Line 2 in Pudong; there are actually two markets, one on each side of the station. The place is much more overrun by foreigners than Qipu Lu, and the asking prices for clothes are higher. However, there is a wider selection here of other products: software, games, electronics, etc. This market also has a number of ",{"type":"'''","value":["tailor shops"]}," for made-to-order clothing.\n\nIt is fairly common for travellers to stop at that market to pick up gifts just before flying out of Shanghai; it is on the metro route to Pudong airport, prices may not be the best in town but they are generally much better than airport shops, selection is good, and it is all on one level so it is moderately convenient to wander about with luggage in tow.\n\nA smaller but more accessible market with similar stuff (but no tailors) is attached to the largest and most central metro station in town, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai\/Huangpu#People.27s_Park"],["People's Park"]]}," on lines 1, 2 and 8.

The first floor is aggressively tourist-oriented, but higher floors are more relaxed and the top floor has quite a good food court that includes a moderately priced Indian place.\n\nThe area around  ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai\/Old_City#See"],["Yuyuan Gardens"]]}," in the old town has similar stuff, with more emphasis on souvenirs and handicrafts rather than clothing, and often with somewhat higher asking prices.\n\nAnother option is the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Pearl Plaza"]}," located on Yan'an Xi Lu and Hongmei Lu (line 10, get off at Longxi Rd stop, go south on Hongmei Lu out of the station past Yan'an elevated road). See ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai\/Minhang#Eat"],["Minhang"]]}," for more on that area. Another, more for day-to-day clothing than anything fancy or touristy, is near Shanghai Ikea; take line 3 to Cao Xi Road, walk toward Ikea and it will be on your left.\n\nBut rather than pursuing knock-offs of Western brands, one of the more interesting things to do in Shanghai is to check out the small boutiques in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai\/French Concession"],["French Concession"]]}," area. Some of these are run by individual designers of clothing, jewellery, etc. and so the items on sale can truly be said to be unique. Visitors from overseas should expect the usual problem of finding larger sizes.\n\nThe largest group of ",{"type":"'''","value":["tailor shops"]}," is at Shanghai South Bund Material Market: 399 Lujiabang Rd (陆家浜路), open 10AM-6PM.  Three floors of tailors and their materials including silk, cashmere, and merino wool. Have items measured, fitted and finished within two days or bring examples, samples or pictures. You can take bus #802 or #64 from the Shanghai Railroad Station and stop at the final stop: Nanpu Bridge Terminal or you can take the Metro Line 4 to the Nanpu Bridge (南浦大桥) Station (exit from gate #1, make a left from the exit and then left again on the light. You will see it to your right after walking about 200 to 250 m. Prices here or in the smaller cluster of such shops at Science & Tech are often better than at standalone shops in town because the competition for customers is fairly intense, but you should bargain for the best price.\n\nFor high-end clothing that is (mostly) not Chinese knock-offs, generally at somewhat higher prices than outside China, the main areas to look are ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai\/Nanjing Road"],["Nanjing Road"]]}," right downtown and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai\/French_Concession#Huahai_Road"],["Huahai Road"]]}," in the French Concession.

The most centrally located 'big chain' supermarket is Carrefour located in floors B1 and B2 of Cloud 9 shopping mall (metro: Zhongshan Park Lines 2, 3 and 4). Tesco has a store in Zhabei district close to the main railway station and there is a huge Lotus supermarket in Top Brands mall in Liujiazui (Metro: Liujiazui, Line 2). There is also a large supermarket with much imported food at Xujiahui (lines 1 and 9); leave the station via at exit 12, which puts you in the basement of a major mall, then walk all the way across the open space at that level.\n\nWhilst there are many stores around the city selling imported products at fairly high prices, Metro Cash'n'Carry is by far the cheapest place to buy imported goods.

Prices are mostly noticeably higher than Metro, but their selection is good and locations are often convenient.\n\nUbiquitous FamilyMart 24-hour convenience stores can be found around the main central districts and inside major metro stations — these stores sell magazines, snacks, drinks and Japanese-style hot bento-boxes although prices are high by Chinese standards. Chinese chains such as KeDi and C-Store can be found in residential districts and are marginally cheaper and also stock cigarettes. 7-Eleven and Lawson convenience stores are less common but can be found around the Nanjing Road area.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Discount cards"]},"\n\nFor small discounts at various restaurants and hotels as well as 50% off tickets to certain attractions (Shanghai World Financial Center observation deck, Happy Valley, Science and Technology Museum, among others) try to find a branch of Woori Bank to sign up for the Shanghai Tourist Card. All Chinese banks issue this as a credit card, preventing non-Chinese visitors from signing up by virtue of requiring proof of income in China, but Woori is a Korean bank and caters to Koreans (including Korean tourists), and thus offers it as a debit card, allowing anyone to sign up for it with just a passport. Sign-up (including account creation) takes approximately half an hour and the card is immediately issued upon account creation. Branches are located near Metro Line 2 Century Ave. station (address is 1600 Century Ave. Pos-Plaza 1-2F) and Metro Line 9 Hechuan Rd. station (address is 188 South Huijin Rd: ask for directions to Bank of China; once you get there, turn right and keep walking until you see it). However, a hotel address may not be acceptable and there may be a handling fee for accounts canceled within a month of opening. An incidental advantage of the Woori Bank Shanghai Tourist Card is that the account allows unlimited free withdrawals at any ATM in China. Thus it will be more convenient to put all your money in the card and withdraw from ATMs only as necessary. If planning to visit two or more of the attractions that half-price tickets are offered for, the time spent is well worth the discount (maximum two discounted tickets purchased per card, offer lasts until end of World Expo).\n\nIn addition, Travelex offers a Shanghai Tourist Card Cash Passport IN JAPAN ONLY. If transiting through there, getting the Cash Passport version is easier and quicker, and offers all the benefits of the Woori Bank version except for free ATM withdrawals.\n\nIn Hong Kong, AEON Credit offers the Shanghai Travel Prepaid card instead. Same as the Travelex card except initial currency is Hong Kong dollars and a 1.1% fee is charged during the Hong Kong dollar->yuan conversion process.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nShanghai's cuisine, like its people and culture, is primarily a fusion of the forms of the surrounding Jiangnan region, with influences sprinkled in more recently from the farther reaches of China and elsewhere. Characterized by some as ",{"type":"'''","value":["sweet and oily"]},", the method of preparation used in Shanghai, it emphasizes freshness and balance, with particular attention to the richness that sweet and sour characteristics can often bring to dishes that are otherwise generally savoury.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Street food in Shanghai.jpg"],["thumb"],["Shanghai street food"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Cookies in Shanghai.jpg"],["thumb"],["Cookie shop, Huahai Road"]]},"\nThe name \"Shanghai\" means \"above the sea\", but paradoxically, the local preference for fish often tends toward the freshwater variety due to the city's location at the mouth of China's longest river. Seafood, nonetheless, retains great popularity and is often braised (fish), steamed (fish and shellfish), or stir-fried (shellfish). Watch out for any seafood that is fried, as these dishes rely far less on freshness and are often the remains of weeks-old purchases.\n\nShanghai's preference for meat is unquestionably pork. Pork is ubiquitous in the style of Chinese cooking, and in general if a mention refers to something as \"meat\" (肉) without any modifiers, the safe assumption is that it is pork. Minced pork is used for dumpling and bun fillings, whereas strips and slices of pork are promulgated in a variety of soups and stir-fries. The old standby of Shanghainese cooking is \"red-cooked [braised\/stewed] pork\" (红烧肉), a traditional dish throughout Southern China with the added flair of anise and sweetness provided by the chefs of Shanghai.\n\nChicken takes the honorable mention in the meat category, and the only way to savour chicken in the Chinese way is to eat it whole (as opposed to smaller pieces in a stir-fry). Shanghai's chickens were once organic and grass-fed, yielding smaller but tender and flavourful birds. Today most chickens are little different from what can be found elsewhere. Still, the unforgettable preparations (drunken, salt-water, plain-boiled with dipping sauce, etc.) of whole chickens chopped up and brought to the table will serve as a reminder that while the industrialization of agriculture has arrived from the West, the preservation of flavour is still an essential element of the local cooking.\n\nThose looking for less cholesterol-laden options need not fret. Shanghai lies at the heart of a region of China that produces and consumes a disproportionately large amount of soy. Thinking tofu? There's the stinky version that when deep-fried, permeates entire blocks with its earthy, often offensive aroma. Of course there are also tofu skins, soy milk (both sweet and savory), firm tofu, soft tofu, tofu custard (generally sweet and served from a road-side cart), dried tofu, oiled tofu and every kind of tofu imaginable. There's also vegetarian duck, vegetarian chicken and vegetarian goose, each of which looks and tastes nothing like the fowl after which it is named but is rather just a soy-dish where the bean curd is expected to approximate the meat's texture. Look out also for gluten-based foods at vegetarian restaurants. If you are vegetarian, do be conscious that tofu in China is often regarded not as a substitute for meat (except by the vegetarian Buddhist monks) but rather as an accompaniment to it. As such, take extra care to ensure that your dish isn't served with peas and shrimp or stuffed with minced pork before you order it.\n\nShanghainese people have 4 special preferences for breakfast dishes (or rather to say dishes, just those simple and quick-to-eat) which are given the name ",{"type":"''","value":["sì dà jīn gāng"]}," (四大金刚, lit. four heavenly kings, a term in Buddhism).

Most of the bars that cater to the expatriate community and many of the foreign-based fast food chains — Starbucks, KFC. Duncan Donuts and likely others — offer free WiFi. Many hotels also provide WiFi service at prices from free to exorbitant; it is moderately common to find free service in one part of a hotel, such as a coffee shop, but substantial charges elsewhere, such as from the rooms.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nShanghai is a fairly ",{"type":"'''","value":["safe city and violent crime is rare"]},". However, the ever-increasing divide between the haves and have-nots has created its fair share of problems. Petty crimes like pickpocketing and bike theft are common, and sexual harassment occasionally occurs on crowded public transport. Pay extra caution before the Chinese New Year (in Jan or Feb depending on lunar calendar), as thieves may be more active in looking for new year money.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Beware"]}," ",{"type":"[[","value":[["pickpockets"]]}," on the main shopping streets. They often work in groups, sometimes including women carrying babies. This sight is extremely common on Nanjing West and East road during rush hours.\n\nBeware of this taxi scam: first you agree on price (e.g. ¥300 for a taxi shared with someone else from Hongqiao Airport to Suzhou) then after some short taxi ride they ask to get out and group of people say that you need to pay agreed money right now. Then you get transferred to a shared bus where other people cheated like yourself sitting and waiting when the bus will depart, then the bus finally gets to destination.\n\nThe notorious ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China#Scams"],["tea house scam"]]},", long practiced in Beijing, is unfortunately spreading to Shanghai as well. Be cautious if over-friendly strangers, who probably dress well, speak good English, and look innocent like a student. They will invite you to an art gallery, tea shop or karaoke bar, and after accepting they will leave you to foot a large bill. In this case, you should call 110 (emergency hotline). The con-artists may tell you that calling the police does not work and claim to have connections with police, but the police in China tend to be helpful in these cases, especially when innocent foreigners are involved. These scams can be found around People's Square near the entrances\/exits of the museums and art galleries. Actual physically harm to yourself is unlikely.\n\nA temple scam in various big cities and also Tibet is when your guides may ask you to make a wish and burn a stick of incense which ends up costing a hundred to more than a thousand. Another trick is to ask you how much you want to \"donate\". After you said ¥10, they will tell you that ¥10 is for 1 day blessing but the monk has already turned an incense to bless you for 1 year, so you need to pay 365 x 10 yuan. This scam has caused significant backlash because of blasphemy since no legitimate temples in China ever charge followers in this way.\n\nMale travellers may attract attention from female sex workers at nightspots. Around the Old Town and the Science Museum in Pudong, hawkers are sometimes also eager to sell. Saying ",{"type":"''","value":["wǒ búyào"]}," (\"I don't want it\") may help. Also be cautious of people who approach and offer to ",{"type":"'''","value":["polish your shoes"]},". Make sure both of you agree on the price before anything is put on your shoes. The same rule also applies to the commercial photographers at the Bund area. They will offer to take your picture with the scenic background (and sometimes with costumes) for ¥50, but once you have contracted their services, several cohorts will arrive to \"assist\" the photographer. They may force you to buy all the snapshots and try to gather crowds to increase pressure.\n\nDon't rush into or out of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Shanghai metro"]}," trains at the last moment. Despite the safety barriers on the platform, the train doors sometimes close before all passengers have boarded; people squeezed between closing doors is a common sight. Apparently, the failsafe that is supposed to block trains from running with open doors isn't foolproof: In 2010 a woman died after being smashed against the safety barriers as she was hanging half out of the closed doors of a train leaving Zhongshan Park Station.\n\nBy Chinese law, foreigners are required to show their passports when requested, although this is rarely enforced. Most hotels will help you keep the passport in the safe, and then you can carry a photocopy along with your hotel's name card.\n\n",{"type":"''","value":["See the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China#Counterfeiting"],["Chinese Money Counterfeiting"]]}," article for details about fake notes that you may encounter"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\n",{"type":"''","value":["See the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China#Stay healthy"],[{"type":"'''","value":["Chinese Stay Healthy"]}]]}," article for general health and food advice."]},"\n",{"type":"''","value":["See the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China#Smog"],[{"type":"'''","value":["Chinese Smog"]}]]}," article for information about issues relating to air pollution"]},"\n\nDo not drink Shanghai's ",{"type":"'''","value":["tap water"]}," unless it is boiled or goes through a reverse-osmosis filter.

When buying ",{"type":"'''","value":["bottled water"]}," you will come across a whole range of foreign and domestic mineral water brands, with the cheaper domestic brands costing ¥1-¥2.50 and are available in all convenience stores and street vendors. Most hotels provide domestic mineral water for free in your room.\n\nIndividuals with asthma or respiratory issues should be prepared when visiting due to the air pollution.\n\nAlthough there are many public hospitals in Shanghai, they are generally not up to the standard that foreigners from Western countries would be used to, and most of the doctors and nurses working there are unable to communicate in English. Ambulance services are unreliable, and in the event of an emergency, the quickest way to get to a hospital would usually be to take a taxi. There are a number of private hospitals and medical clinics around the city that serve foreigners and expatriates exclusively. The doctors and nurses working at these places will be able to speak English, and the standard of care is usually on par with what most Westerners are used to back home, though their services are usually very expensive. Many of these medical services will take travel insurance if your insurance company is partnered with the hospital. Generally speaking you will likely have to pay ahead of time, however these facilities tend to be far superior in equipment and cleanliness to the ones that Chinese locals are forced to deal with.\n\nA popular chain of western medical clinics is ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.parkwayhealth.cn Parkway Health"]},". There is a 24 hotline in English ( 6445 5999 ) to arrange a appointment in a clinic closest to you. Note that this service is expensive, with basic medical consultations starting at ¥1,200. Check with your insurance beforehand to see if you are fully or partly covered.\n\nNote that because these services are pay services, they are paid more when they conduct more tests. Furthermore, Chinese doctors, even Western-trained ones, tend to be overly thorough compared to Western doctors.  However since you are a customer, they are not usually too insistent on unnecessary tests. Use your common sense to determine if you need the ordered tests (e.g. blood tests, x-rays etc.).\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=International Medical Care Center of Shanghai First People's Hospital"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.firsthospital.cn"],["email="],["address=585 Jiu Long Road, near Haining Lu, Hangkou  (九龙路585号，近海宁路)"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=In Building 1"],["phone=6324 3852"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=08:00-17:00 (Mon-Fri)"],["price=Provides \"VIP Service\" for ¥300, then you pay for whatever services on top of the basic examination"],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Media"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Shanghai Daily"],["url=http:\/\/www.shanghaidaily.com\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=English-language newspaper and website."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Shanghai International Channel"],["url=http:\/\/www.icshanghai.com\/en\/"],["content=English-language TV channel"]]}]},"\nExpatriates generally find these Shanghai-based media outlets preferable to the China-wide People's Daily and CCTV-9.\n\nThere are also several English-language papers that consist mainly of listings, reviews and advertisements for restaurants and nightlife.

Established prior to the Expo and maintained as a public service, the call center is a free-of-charge phone number that provides information regarding bus, metro, and taxi directions, business hours, attractions, and can even be utilized as a free translation service. If you are having trouble communicating with your taxi driver or a vendor, don't hesitate to call the number and pass the phone back and forth, having the operator translate.\n\nThe so-called \"Magic Number\" can be reached at 962288 from Shanghai cell phones. Chinese cell phones from other cities should dial 021 962288, and international phones should dial +86 021 962288. A short message in Mandarin will greet you, followed by a set of English instructions. Service is available in several European languages such as English and Spanish.\n\nThe service itself is free of charge, but you pay the cost of the phone call.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Etiquette"]},"\n\nSee the China article for discussion of some ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China#Potentially jarring behaviours"],["Chinese behaviours"]]}," that may irritate visitors, but note that most of these are less problematic in Shanghai than elsewhere.\n\nCrowding in, rather than queuing, is a problem you are likely to encounter; indeed this can be worse in busy Shanghai than elsewhere. Whether at a ticket booth, at a busy fast food counter, or even at the grocery store, everyone jockeys for position by crowding around a staff member, and will do whatever possible to get in first, and get out. If at all possible, avoid the situation in the first place; for example, recharge your metro card a bit early if you see a quiet ticket counter.\n\nPushing in the metro is normal, especially at the chaotic People's Square Station. Just dig in and push; don't feel sorry. However, compared to public transport in other Chinese cities, the Shanghainese are better at letting people alight first and the mad rush for empty seats is not quite so bad — your behaviour should follow the situation: if the station is crowded then pushing is acceptable, but if not then you are more likely to be looked upon as an 'uncivilised foreigner'. Also, outside of busy times you should stand to the right on escalators to allow people to pass.\n\nNote that Shanghai Metro drivers will close the train doors and depart when the schedule says so, even if people are still boarding. When you hear the 'door closing' alarm (usually a series of beeps) stand back from the doors (particularly on the old Line 1 and 2 trains as the doors close very quickly and may not re-open if blocked).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Work Permits and Visa extensions"]},"\n\nPlease refer to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China#Work"]]}," for general information about Chinese work visas.
