The crosspiece of the H is a walkway with moving sidewalks and some transport connections such as the intercity bus stop and the terminal for the fast Maglev trains.\n\nTerminal 1 has an international air-side which is somewhat cramped, whereas Terminal 2 is extremely spacious.\n\nConsisting of three parts — the main hall, the hallway and the lounge — T2 has a combined floor space of 546,000 square meters or over 5.8 million square feet.

If arriving during busy commute times, consider taking the Metro to avoid congestion on the road.\n\nSome of the higher-end hotels offer their own shuttle service for guests.

There are taxi queues just outside both Terminals 1 and 2 on the first floor.\n\nTaxi drivers will generally not know how to find your address if written in English, and even often when written in Chinese! Some taxis have GPS but most do not. It is recommended to have a printout with both the area map and the address in Chinese.

Using magnetic levitation technology, it does not touch the tracks and traverses 30.5 km in as little as 7 minutes, while hitting a maximum speed of 431 km\/h (267 mph).  During non-peak hours, the train goes to 301 km\/h. It currently operates from 06:45 to 21:30 daily and costs ¥50 one way (¥40 if you have a flight ticket or if you use the Shanghai Transportation card)) or ¥80 for a round-trip ticket (good for up to seven days from date of purchase). You can also opt to pay double for \"VIP Class\", which gets you a soft drink and bragging rights but no really different environment. Trains depart every 15–30 minutes depending on the time of day.\n\nThe Maglev has only one stop, Longyang Road Metro Station (龙阳路地铁站) where you can transfer to Metro Line 2 or Line 7, still a way from People's Square but a good stopping point if Pudong is your final destination. The journey usually requires a combination with walking, public transport or a taxi.  You will need the ticket to get out of the station. The Maglev and airport station are not well marked on the city metro\/rail map so if in doubt ask so you exit at the right station to make your connection from Maglev to normal metro line.\n\nThe Maglev station is between Terminals 1 and 2 along the second floor walkway that connects them. Note that between the baggage claim and the Maglev station, people may tell you the Maglev is \"broken\" or \"shut down because of weather\" but they may just be trying to get you into their taxi. Pay them no attention; upon arriving at the station you will see the trains are running.\n\nFrom Longyang Rd as you exit, the escalator on your right goes down to the Metro Station (Line 2) and another escalator on the opposite end to your left will take you to the taxi queue. A taxi to Puxi city center will cost you another ¥30-50, while a ride to Pudong's Lujiazui should only be about ¥20-25. Taxi drivers seldom speak any English so have your destination in writing (or use an airport attendant's how-to) and fare estimate before agreeing on a driver. Estimates are also posted near the exit doors on the first floors near the pick-up area and bus station area. It is not advisable to use a driver outside the queue unless there are two of you and someone speaks good Shanghainese (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wu phrasebook"],["Wu Chinese"]]},") or standard Mandarin. Use caution and double check the charges as some drivers may try to scam you, but not many. It is against local law to pick up other passengers not affiliated with your party so reject this if attempted by the driver.\n\nIf your destination is conveniently located on a metro stop (People's Square, Jing'an Temple) and your baggage is light, it would be cheaper and maybe even faster to hop onto Line 2 located just parallel to the Maglev station. You will need to go down the escalators on the opposite side of the taxi queue. Metro fare ranges from ¥2-6 all across the city.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" To Hongqiao Airport"]},"\nHongqiao is Shanghai's main airport for domestic flights and is across town (perhaps 50 km or 30 miles) from Pudong Airport.
