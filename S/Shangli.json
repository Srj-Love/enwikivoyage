[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Mena-asia_default_banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nShànglǐ (上里) is a historical village located near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ya'an"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sichuan"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China"]]},". It's a great, unspoilt place to stop between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chengdu"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Leshan"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Emei"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kangding"]]},".\n\nShànglǐ was once an important stop on the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Silk Road"]]}," (the Horse and Tea route) and during the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Long March"]]},". Many slogans can still be seen around the town, carved into rock by the Red Army. Shànglǐ is also know for its 8 different stone bridges of varying style which cross the waterways surrounding the town on all sides. \n\nTourism here is picking up again after the Sichuan earthquake, but most of the tourists are predominantly domestic Chinese and foreigners are still somewhat of a novelty. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nMinibuses bound for Shànglǐ can be caught from outside the tourist bus station in Ya'an which is a short rickshaw ride (¥6) away from the main bus station.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nWalk! The town isn't large.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nExploring on foot is easy enough to do. Look out for:\n\nthe bamboo water wheel.\n\nthe eight stone bridges of varying style - in particular, look out for Erxian Bridge, made purely out of stone fashioned into a high arch.\n\nthe pagoda across the fields opposite town next to the pass through the hillocks which goes to Shànglǐ proper.\n\nthe Red Army stone carvings, a display of which can be seen on the riverbank pathway next to where you get down off the minibus.\n\nthe Han courtyard.\n\nthe semi-restored, ancient mill.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nRelax, and absorb the village's atmosphere.\n\nWander into the surrounding countryside.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\nA plethora of stores catering to the domestic Chinese tourists. Don't expect any English to be spoken!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nNext to the square outside the Han courtyard, there is a little noodle shop offering the seemingly local specialty 大肉面 (dàròumiàn; pork fat noodle soup), but if you don't want the fat, go for the 牛肉面 (nǐuròumiàn; beef noodle soup) done in a similar way. The eatery has photos of the head chef with some famous person (I couldn't determine who) in a bigger restaurant which made it look more promising than others. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\nRelax in the large, comfortable bamboo chairs located right next to the streams. One restaurant has them situated right on the bank of the river but it is quite pricey. Another store, right next to the bamboo waterwheel, has chairs for customers seeking pricey tea, but they don't seem to mind if you buy cheaper refreshments from their store and drink them sitting there. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\nWithin the Han courtyard itself, there is a new, somewhat atmospheric, cheap hotel with great views - 银杏苑 (Yínxìngyuàn) offering (for my visit) ¥50 for a single with TV & ensuite (Ph: 08352316682 \/ 13980175152 \/ 13882439152). Definitely recommended!\n\nApparently, there is a cheaper place in town if you want to go out seeking it.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\nTake the minibus out of town that you used to get into town.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["East Sichuan"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["no Wikipedia link"]]}]
