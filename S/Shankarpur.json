Immediately after the Power Station is a junction, turn left towards ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Haldia"]]},". You have now entered the Haldia Highway (NH41). Some of this road is 4 laned, but most of it is still a 2 lane road. Keep straight till you arrive at the Nandakumar crossing, you can identify it easily as the crossing has a wide round circle. Turn right at this crossing, you have now entered the Digha Road. Digha Road is a 2 lane road, the road is smooth but narrow and the buses drive at very high speed, so be extremely careful when overtaking. Follow Digha road, you will cross Narghat Bridge and pass through Chandipur, Bajkul, Heria and Kanthi (Contai). At Choddomile before Ramnagar take a left towards Shankarpur, This road is bad.
