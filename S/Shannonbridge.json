It lies within the townland of Raghra (Irish: ",{"type":"''","value":["Reachra"]},"), at the borders of counties Offaly, Galway and Roscommon, with the majority of the population living east of the bridge in County Offaly. It has a population of approximately 600, and is predominantly low rise and low-density. It contains a number of different building styles, with two housing estates situated within the village. Its location along Ireland’s largest river and its proximity to Clonmacnoise have contributed to tourism being a key factor in its local economy. It is rich in heritage and the village is flanked by an important nature conservation area – the Shannon Callows. The physical environment consists of the River Shannon, callows, boglands and the Esker Riada (a major routeway in the 18th century). The village has one of the oldest bridges still in use over the River Shannon, completed in 1757.\nThe monastic settlement of Clonmacnoise is some 7 km upriver.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" R357 from Ballinasloe"]},{"type":"*","value":[" R444 from Athlone"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\nShannonbridge lies on the ",{"type":"'''","value":["River Shannon"]},", so you can get in easily by boat.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nWalk or cycle\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=River Shannon"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Look at the River Shannon"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Clonmacnoise"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=See this monastic site built hundreds of years ago"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Shannonbridge - Gas and diesel station off R357 - geograph.org.uk - 1612667.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Petrol Station"]]}," \n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Fishing"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=For many years now, anglers from all over the world have been returning to once again plunder the incredible array of waters that ebb and flow a mere stone's throw from the village's Main Street."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Tennis"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Court was built in 1988.
