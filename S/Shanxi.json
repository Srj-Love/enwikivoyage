The Yellow, Haihe, and Fenhe Rivers flow through Shanxi, whose splendid landscape is graced by the celebrated Taihang and Liliang Ranges and Hengshan and Wutai Mountains. Most parts of the province are more than 1000 meters above sea level.\n\nShanxi's long history is traced back to the days when it was a major cradle of Chinese civilization. In remote antiquity, southern Shanxi was the domain of three legendary kings, Yao (capital: Pingyuan or present day Linfen), Shen (capital: Puban or present day Yongji) and Yu (capital: Anyi or present day Xiaxian County).\n\nA rich cultural heritage mixes with natural wonders to form Shanxi's bustling tourist scene. Datong, Wutai Mountain, Taiyuan, Pingyao, Linfen, and Yuncheng are locations full of historic and cultural significance.  Several sites in Shanxi are ",{"type":"[[","value":[["World_Heritage_Site#China"],["UNESCO World Heritage Site"]]},"s.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Flights to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Taiyuan"]]}," from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guangzhou"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beijing"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":["Trains to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Taiyuan"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pingyao"]]}," from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beijing"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Xi'an"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" Train to Datong from Beijing: convenient tourist train departs around 3PM from Beijing Western Station and arrives at Datong at 8:30PM."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe main sites in Shanxi are clustered around the main provincial highway, an impressive modern tollway which runs from Datong in the north to Yuncheng in the south.  This highway passes through or near such major tourist centers as Taiyuan (the capital city), Pingyao, and Linfen.  Thus the key tourist sights in Shanxi are easily visited by car. (The main exception being Wutai Shan, which can be reached by car but which is not so close to this main highway.) Unfortunately it is not that easy to rent a car and\/or driver in Shanxi, particularly if one is not a Chinese speaker.  This is best arranged through a travel agency.\n\nShanxi also has a major rail line which runs parallel to this highway and which stops at the key cities.  It is a good way to get from city to city, although one does need to check the schedules carefully as some cities are served infrequently.\n\nThe main airports are in Taiyuan and in Datong.\n\nThere are many local and long distance bus lines in Shanxi.  In general the buses get to destinations more quickly than the train.\n\nTaxis are freely available for local trips or for daily hire.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landmarks and buildings"]},"\nPortions of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Great Wall of China"]]}," can be seen in the province, including ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Outer Wall of Shanxi"]}," at Li'erkou to Deshengbu, Juqiangbu to Laoniuwan, and along the Yellow River, near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Datong"]]},", as well as ",{"type":"'''","value":["The Inner Wall of Shanxi"]}," at  Yanmenguan, Guangwu Old City, Ningwu Pass and Niangziguan.\n\nGrottoes of interest can be found at ",{"type":"'''","value":["Yungang Grottoes"]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Datong"]]}," and at ",{"type":"'''","value":["Tianlongshan Grottoes"]}," near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Taiyuan"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Pingyao Ancient City"]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pingyao"]]}," is an attraction in itself.
