Mao Zedong, later to be known as Chairman Mao was born in a farming house there on December 26, 1893 to a wealthy farming family. He left the city in his early years but came back as leader for a week in 1966 to hold a conference in the purpose-built facility at Water Dripping Cave. Since Mao's death, Shaoshan has become a destination of pilgrimage to visit the roots of the defining figure of 20th Century Chinese history, and in turn those of the Communist Party.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Get in "]},"\n\nShaoshan lies about an hour's drive out from the provincial capital of Changsha.\nThere are two trains from Changsha to Shaoshan. Train NO.1 departures at 7:05AM and arrives in Shaoshan at 9:35AM Train NO.2 departures at 5:00 in the afternoon and gets there at 8:00 in the evening.\nThe highway of Shaoshan extends to all directions.

However, it is important to note that these, as with the tourist area as a whole, is catered largely for domestic tourists, so you will be lucky to find a restaurant with a picture menu, let alone one in English. Hunan cuisine is famously hot, so if you don't want a dish red in colour from all the chili, its best to make it clear beforehand.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Sleep "]},"\n\nThe Hualong Manor Hotel is an affordable and comfortable hotel, although don't expect much English understanding from the staff. In general, in these less traveled areas of China, the best move would be to book a local or independent guide who can arrange booking and check-in for you.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Go next "]},"\n\nShaoshan can easily be covered in a day, so it would be a good idea to incorporate it within a greater tour of Hunan. The provincial capital, Changsha, is nearby, which holds the Hunan Provincial Museum, which is a must for those interested at all in Chinese History. Also in Hunan is the Zhangjiajie-Wulingyuan area, which boasts some of the best scenic spots in all China.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Hunan"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["27.91"],["112.48"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Shaoshan"]]}]
