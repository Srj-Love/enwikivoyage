The island has a land area of 19.952 kmÂ² (7.7037 sq mi) and a small year-round population of 240 (2010 census). Summer time weekends swell with other residents and the occasional tourists. The Wilkes Expedition, in 1841, named the island after John Shaw, a United States Naval Officer.\n\nThere are two Catholic religious institutes of nuns on Shaw Island. Benedictine nuns established a monastery on 150 acres in the 1970s; while the Sisters of Mercy have owned an unofficial retreat on the island since the 1980s. Nuns of the Franciscan Sisters of the Eucharist ran the island's only store and the ferry terminal for more than two decades until 2004 where they could be seen in full habit directing ferry traffic.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nShaw Island is accessible by the Washington State Ferry system.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nShoreline access is best at the Shaw County Park.
