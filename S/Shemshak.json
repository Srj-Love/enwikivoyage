[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Mena-asia_default_banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Shemshak"]}," is a village in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Iran"]]}," with a popular ski resort. It is situated to the north-east of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tehran"]]}," in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alborz"]]}," mountain range.\n\nShemshak is the second largest ski area in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Iran"]]}," after ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dizin"]]}," and came into operation in 1958. It includes two ski lifts, three dish teleskis and two Hammer teleskis. The slopes lie at an altitude of 2550m to 3050m above sea level. The resort includes two main slopes each with a chair lift that apex at the top and several lifts. There are also lighting facilities for night skiing.\n\nShemshak has classically catered to more advanced skiers while Dizin has drawn Beginner and Intermediate Skiers. The slopes are quite steep and many of the runs are mogul runs.\n\nShemshak is conveniently situated just about 55 minutes drive from Tehran, 10 km from middle-slope parking of Dizin and 5 km from Darband-Sar ski resort\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nAn early morning taxi should be about 150,000 IR one way.  If you are only skiing for the day, ensure that the driver takes you all the way to the ski hire shops near the entrance (as the main road is quite steep).  Look out for the Super Star burger outlet, about 100m down from the ski field entrance.\n\nThere are rumors of public transport (savaris and minibuses), although these do not seem to depart from Tehran's Eastern Bus Terminal as suggested by the most recent edition of the Iran Lonely Planet.  A knowledgeable young local may be able to assist.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nShemshak is compact enough to get around on foot, although the main village road is a little steep and can get covered in ice and mud.

Trail maps seem rather scarce, although a number of websites have produced their own (see, for example, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.snow-forecast.com\/resorts\/Shemshak\/pistemap snow-forecast.com)"]},".\n\nRental prices vary, but a decent set of skis, boots and poles can be found from 150,000 IR.
