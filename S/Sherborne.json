I had a delicious DIY breakfast in my room, which was lovely to do in my own time and in my dressing gown ( also provided) my little fridge was full with berries, yogurt, pancakes and juice, it was really nice not to have to dress to be in a dining room for a set time. I enjoyed my coffee and toast in bed( a hot breakfast is available apparently on request.) After a nice hot shower, It was just 6 mins walk to my train.
