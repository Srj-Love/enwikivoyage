There are two boats, a big slow ferry, and a small fast speed cruiser.  Travel time is 2.5 hours on the fast boat and 9-10 hours (overnight) on the slow one. The price of the ferry ranges from around ¥5,000 (free sleeping -- you must find a place on the ground) to ¥15,000 or more if you wish seats or private cabins.  The price is higher in summer.\n\nTaking the overnight ferry can be an interesting way to travel if you don't suffer from sea sickness. Most people choose the cheapest tickets, and sleep on the ground (either outside, or in big cabins, with delimited spaces on the ground). On board there is a basic restaurant and many vending machines selling food, soft and alcoholic drinks. The facilities are basic. You can rent a blanket for ¥200.\n\nAfter leaving Tokyo Bay and passing under the famous Rainbow Bridge the coast line of the bay becomes hard to see but soon after sunrise it's possible to relax on the deck and watch the ferry approach and dock in two islands, Oshima and Niijima, before reaching Shikinejima. It will go to Miyakejima afterwards, and then return to Tokyo.\n\nIf you have booked a room in a \"minshuku\" (民宿, the budget version of a ryokan) then the staff will be waiting at the port to greet you and drive you to your lodging when you arrive at the port in the morning.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe island is 3.9 square kilometers in total.
