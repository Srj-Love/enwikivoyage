Unzen, an active volcano dominating the region. After nearly 200 years of dormancy, Mt Unzen last erupted in 1991, killing 43 and devastating the southern district of town with the resultant pyroclastic flows.\n\nThe city is also the site of the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Shimabara Rebellion"]}," in which Christians and locals who were unsatisfied with grossly high taxes and oppression of Christianity fought to regain control of the territory. They were unsuccessful, and with the help of the Dutch, the Japanese stopped the rebellion and beheaded approximately 37,000 Christians and peasants. It also led to the ousting of the Portuguese who they no longer trusted, making the Dutch the only Europeans the Japanese were willing to trade with. Although Christianity had already been banned prior to the rebellion, the rebellion made the government even more anti-Christian and even stricter enforcement of the religious ban was established.\n\nNowadays Shimabara acts as the gateway between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nagasaki"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kumamoto"]]}," and sightseeing in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Unzen Volcanic Area Geopark"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\nTrains run direct from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Isahaya"]]},", near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nagasaki"]]}," along the private Shimabara line.
