This legend is engraved on a large stone plaque at the burial site. The story states that during Jesus' young life, that period of time where not much is written about him in the Bible, Jesus was living in Japan and learning Shinto philosophies that he mixed in with Judaism. Then, when Jesus was going to be crucified, his identical twin brother Isukiri snuck in and \"casually took his place on the cross.\"(sic) Then Jesus travelled back to Japan through Siberia and Alaska. In Japan, Jesus raised a family, lived to the age of 106 and was buried in Shingo village. His brother's body was also transported to Japan and buried there. Jesus' and Isukiri's tombs are both marked by a cross. Christ's descendant still lives in Shingo town. At the tomb they have a small museum and a meditation path with some fountains."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" The ",{"type":"'''","value":["Pyramids"]}," are a mildly disappointing site with a spectacular view.
