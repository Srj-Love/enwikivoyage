From Bangalore, you can drive along the Bangalore Mysore highway till Maddur. Immediately after Maddur Bus station, take a left towards Malavalli. Keep going further straight from Malavalli and you'll reach Shivanasamudram. This route would take around 135 kilometers and the road is good upto Maddur, after which, the road condition deteriorates. However, this is the best road to reach Shivanasamudra from Bangalore. A non-stop journey would take approximately 3 hours from Bangalore. \n\nAlternately, one can reach Malavalli from Bangalore via Kanakapura. Take the Kanakapura road from Bangalore which is in good condition. Immediately after Kanakapura, the road branches into two. Take the road which is slightly to the right to reach Malavalli. The left branch leads to Sangama, Makedattu and Chunchi falls. The stretch from Kanakapura to Malavalli is not in good condition and road repair work is in progress at some places. After reaching Malavalli, take a left turn to go to Shivanasamudra. It is advisable to avoid this route and take the Bangalore-Maddur-Malavalli-Shivanasamudra route instead, as the roads in that route are in better condition.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Arun image23.jpg"],["thumb"],["Gagana Chukki Falls"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nGagana Chukkii falls can be seen from two sides.
