Common sense is suggested when visiting the city.  There are many neighborhoods where crime is more rampant including Mooretown, Allendale, Queensbourough, and Cedar Grove.  It is not recommended to drive through these areas.  Be aware of your surroundings at all times.  If it looks like the neighborhood is going downhill it might be best to turn around rather than drive through.  It is not recommended to walk alone or in small groups after dark in the downtown district unless you stay in the well populated areas near the casinos and bars.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Bonnie and Clyde Ambush Museum"]},", 2419 Main St Gibsland LA 71028, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/bonnieandclydemuseum.com\/"]},".
