This is the closest most Zambians will ever get to a seaside town or resort\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nQuite an amazing drive from Lusaka, heading south. Expect to see beautiful scenery, especially when going through the hills, heaps of trucks with breakdowns (often conviently placed in the middle of the road sideways) and risky corners where several trailers have met their destiny (often due to bad brakes or unattentive driving). Expect trip to take 2 hours or so, depending on number of trucks. The road to Siavonga has recently been rebuilt (2004), and should (hopefully) not have any potholes.\n\nItâ€™s only two and half-hour drive from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lusaka"]]}," through Kafue town.

However, the most amazing aspect of this lodge is the white (and extremely hot) silky smooth sand that runs right down to the water. But don't be too tempted of having a dip in the water, as it's infested with crocodiles. However, the Lodge has a pool. Activities include sailing, house boating and fishing. US$ 10. Wait for the evening meal to be served as you sit by the beach front and listen to the waves moving in and out.
