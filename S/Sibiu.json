Even today, it contains Romania's largest German community, and due to initiatives by the local government, the Germanic feel of the area has been maintained. Sibiu also has a significant Hungarian minority, remnants of Transylvania's past as part of the Hungarian Empire and, later, Austria-Hungary. Despite this, Sibiu is also distinctly Romanian (95% of the population are ethnic Romanians) and manages to fuse these three cultures, as well as smaller minorities of Roma, Slovaks and Ukrainians into a city that is as wonderful as it is vibrant.\n\nToday, Sibiu is one of Romania's cultural and tourism capitals, attracting tourists due to its wonderful medieval charm, excellent views of the surrounding landscapes, great food, and stunning parkland. Sibiu today is also doing excellently economically, having an income per capita higher than the Romanian average.\n\nMuch of the city has been reconstructed due to it being the European Capital of Culture in 2007 and has benefited greatly from the funds made available. The people in Sibiu are much more relaxed and friendly than in Bucharest, and much of the city is pedestrian-friendly. There are even bicycling facilities (a rarity in car obsessed Romania)!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nSibiu is well connected to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bucharest"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cluj Napoca"]]},". From Cluj Napoca there are buses almost every hour, provided by Dacos, Fany and Transmixt, taking around 3.5 h. The buses are smooth-running, very comfortable and cheap.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\n\nDespite Sibiu's location in the centre of the Romania, it is quite a lot harder to get here than to other cities like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brasov"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cluj-Napoca"]]},", mainly due to Sibiu's location outside the main railway line which joins Bucharest to Hungary and beyond. However, train remains the easiest, cheapest and most comfortable way to get here. Remember, though, that from Bucharest, there are just two trains daily to Sibiu (one in the morning, one in the night). Also, Sibiu is one of the only cities of Romania not served by the modern and snazzy InterCity network from Bucharest, even though there are InterCity trains from Cluj Napoca.\n\nFrom Bucharest, the train most tourists take is the day train ",{"type":"'''","value":["A 1621"]}," which leaves Bucharest North at 10:30AM and arrives at Sibiu at 17:31, nearly 7 hours later and stopping at most towns along the way. The train is pretty uncomfortable and crowded- hopefully, however, CFR Romanian Railways will soon introduce InterCity trains on this route.\n\nComing from Cluj Napoca, the main city of Transylvania, is a much better opportunity to get to Sibiu. In fact, many tourists do just that, as part of their Transylvanian tour. From Cluj Napoca, there are two fairly-convenient trains a day, one at 5:41AM and one at 2:57PM, taking around 3.5 h. The trains are smooth-running and very comfortable.\n\nThe train schedule changes every summer and winter so it is better to check it online.

In this way rather than renting a car I could agree on a price and have the driver run me to the place I desired, some distance out of town, wait for me for about half an hour, with the mete off and start the meter again on the return journey. In this win-win situation I had the taxi at my beck and call, and the taxi firm saved on petrol from having the taxi get back empty to the city and being called again to the outlaying village. At times I was lucky in having the hotel reception finding me a taxi driver who could speak English. In particular I found one of German descent who was very courteous, knowledgeable and found him agreeable. He was a fast but safe driver, unlike another one who even had the cheek to bring along his girlfriend at one time!
