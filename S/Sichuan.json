There is a moderate amount of bilingual signage in the area. Therefore, many young people in the western regions are bilingual in Tibetan and Mandarin or just speak Mandarin. Qiangic, spoken by the Qiang minority group, also native to Sichuan, can also be found in isolated parts of western Sichuan. The vast majority of signage is always in Mandarin Chinese characters throughout the province regardless of the ethnic majority in the given area albeit you will see some signage in Tibetan indic script.

One recent innovation is a fast train between Chongqing and Chengdu. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chongqing"]]}," is a very large city which was part of Sichuan until 1997 but now is an independent municipality. Many trains shuttle every day between Chongqing and Chengdu. Not so long ago, the journey took anywhere between 4 and 8 hours depending on stops. Now a fast ",{"type":"[[","value":[["High-speed rail in China"],["bullet train"]]}," (over 200 km per hour) runs several times a day between the two.\n\nAnother option is buses. Buses run between Chongqing and Chengdu taking about 4 hours. However, bus travel seems to be less reliable than trains because of road works that are often occurring.\n\nThere are also several options for travelling within Sichuan. Many popular tourist destinations such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Leshan"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jiuzhaigou National Park"]]}," are serviced by buses. The network is quite extensive and the highways are good.

Typically, the pot has two parts separated by a partition; one side is extremely spicy, the other milder.\n\nSichuan food plays approximately the role in China that Mexican food does in the US or Indian food in the UK.

Make sure to monitor your health and take it easy for a day or two if moving from the lowlands to higher elevations.\n\nTo help combat this sickness, many local Chinese eat medicine known as Hong Jing Tian. These are red capsules that the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army use to help them quickly adjust to altitude conditions in the Western Chinese provinces. Local tour companies will have a ready supply of this medicine if you ask.\n\nThere is also tension in Western Sichuan between the Chinese government and the mainly Tibetan people there, and travel restrictions may apply to this area.
