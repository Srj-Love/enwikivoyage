While the government sector still suffers from chronic shortage of resources, the private sector is booming.  The potential for tourism is vast, but largely unrealised. Tourists are starting to return and tour operators are looking closely at what the country has to offer.  Sierra Leone is rich in natural resources.

Work has started on the remaining section to Lumley, but at the beginning of 2013 is complete only from Lumley to Goderich, with the section between No. 2 Beach and Tokeh being nearly impassable to all but high-clearance 4WD and motorbikes. \n\nThe roads in Freetown are difficult to characterize. In central Freetown, the main roads are mostly smooth and pothole-free, having been constructed from high-quality asphalt a long time ago. Side streets are often a mixture of dirt and gravel, sometimes with large protruding stones, deep crevasses, and other potential dangers. Some main feeder roads such as Sir Samuel Lewis road in the Western part of Freetown are in atrocious condition.  Wilkinson Road and Spur Road have been reconstructed as dual carriage ways.  The Hillside bypass road is also being constructed, which will make the transit from east to west much easier.  Work has also started on Regent Road through the mountains, Main Motor Road, Wilberforce and Lumley Beach Road from the Lumley end.  All these works mean that roads can be closed and alternative routes have to be used.\n\nStreet parking on major routes such as Wilkinson Road is not permitted.  This also applies to the layby's, where stopping is only permitted for a short time.  The local police are using wheel clamps which can very quickly be applied.  These will require a visit to the local police with Le300,000 to get released.\n\nWhen walking, always keep your eyes in front of you: most of the sidewalks in Freetown have \"death traps\" - missing blocks of cement that could lead to a nasty fall into an open gutter.

They are really cheap, though. Intercity trips often cost a mere 1,500-2,500 Leones (2011 ~US$0.50), and any trip within Freetown just 1,000.

The mobile phone network uses the GSM technology (as in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Europe"]]},") and use is widespread. The format for dialling is: +232-##-######, where  the first \"##\" designates the area code. Key area codes include Freetown (22) and Bo (32).  Calls to mobile phones use the operator's area codes: (77\/88\/30) for Africell, (76\/78) for Airtel (Celtel\/Zain) and (33) for Comium. Tigo was bought by Africell in late 2009, and their 30 prefix was incorporated into the Africell network. Like other countries, when dialling locally, \"00\" is used to access an international number (and followed by the country code) and \"0\" is used to access a national number (followed by the area code).  The major cities and industrial areas enjoy good coverage as well as some major national roads.  Airtel is the oldest and has the best nationwide coverage.  International roaming is available. International calling is relatively cheap. Some of the mobile networks charge as little as $0.35\/minute to all countries with some countries costing just $0.15 per minute.\n\nAirtel Sierra Leone is part of the One Network Service. This allows an Airtel SIM card from another country to be used in Sierra Leone.  Incoming calls are free to receive and local calls are charged at local rates. Remember that calls to the SIM cards home country will be charged at international rates.\n\nSierra Leone now uses 112 for emergency calls from any phone network.
