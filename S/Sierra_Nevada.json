Roads may be closed as late as July.  When snow falls in mid October, it usually kills a few unprepared backpackers in the Sierra who hadn't carefully checked the weather reports.

During winter you should always carry tire chains in your car and know how to use them.\n\nWhen hiking or backpacking where you will be far from help, check the weather first.  The first snows of Winter may come earlier than you expect.\n\nIn summer during the North American Monsoon, thunderstorms often build up near the crest of the Sierra Nevada, particularly during late afternoon.  It is unwise to be in a high, treeless place during a thunderstorm.
