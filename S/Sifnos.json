Inhabited since very early times, Sifnos's main claim to fame in the ancient world was for its gold and silver mines, some remains of which still exist, as a result of which the island became known by the 6th cent. BCE as one of the most prosperous places in Greece.  This wealth was reflected in the Treasury of the Siphnians at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Delphi"]]},", which was reputed to be one of the most opulent buildings at that shrine; its foundations may still be seen there today. The Greek historian Pausanias records that the island's gold mines were destroyed in an earthquake caused by Apollo after the islanders, out of greed, sent as tribute to Delphi a gold-gilded egg instead of the solid gold one which they had traditionally sent before. By Hellenistic times, the island's golden age had passed, and its subsequent history is subsumed in the general history of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cyclades"]]},".  \n\nIn its geography and climate Sifnos falls naturally into two halves, the western part, where most ferries land, being bare and rugged, while the eastern part, which most visitors find more amenable, has somewhat more gentle terrain and is greener.  Unfortunately mass tourism has destroyed most of its traditional atmosphere.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\n\nDaily or almost daily fast boats and steamship ferries connect ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sifnos"]]}," with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Piraeus"]]}," during high season (the ride takes about five hours by steamship, about half that by fast catamaran).  On summer weekends and holidays some of the fast boats can sell out, so if you're going at these times you may want to buy a ticket in advance. In summer there are buses every hour or two from Kamares to most other points on the island.  There are usually also taxis waiting when ferries arrive, but sometimes these can fill up.  Some hotels offer transfers from the port at rates that can be anything from free to more than a taxi; if interested, ask your hotel when you reserve.\n\nAll ferry and high speed companies : schedules, connections, availability and prices, between Sifnos, other Greek islands & Piraeus port (Athens) is here ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.gtp.gr\/"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sifnos"]]}," does not have an airport of its own.

This hotel\/sweet shop also runs a nearby shop on the main shopping lane which sells local foods, including the very good local capers (pickled along with their leaves, and much more pungent and flavorful than typical bottled capers) and the simple but interesting Sifnos wine.
