Nationwide protests in India by environmentalists and mass publicity by the media led the then prime minister, Indira Gandhi to order the state government to abolish the hydroelectric project. The area was declared a National Park.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Karuvara water fall - silent valley.jpg"],["300px"],["thumb"],["right"],["Karuvara waterfall"]]},"\n\nThe park is actually named ",{"type":"'''","value":["Indira Gandhi National Park"]},", and Silent Valley is the name of the place, but it is also called Silent Valley National Park. It is a wonderful place to visit for tourists.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Contact details"]},": The Wildlife Warden, Silent Valley National Park, Mannarkkad, Palakkad dist, Kerala.

If you are planning to stay at Mukkali, reserve rooms in advance at the Forest dept resthouse. Or else you can stay at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mannarkkad"]]}," and hire a jeep to reach Mukkali by 8AM. Mukkali is about 60 km from Palakkad, with Mannarkkad en route. The visit to the Valley and Kunti river will take only a day, and you can return back to Palakkad the same evening.\n\nAnother close railway station is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Coimbatore Junction"]]},"(Coimbatore). From \nCoimbatore, take the road to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Anakatty"]]},"(around 30 kms) from Coimbatore and from Ankatty to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Agali"]]}," (15 kms)and then Mukkali(20 kms). The total distance via the Coimbatore route is only around 65kms. Its almost a straight road drive from Coimbatore to Mukkali. The scenic roadway keeps one captivated all through.\n\nPermission is required from the Kerala Forest Department. For a short one day trip (usually taken by tourists), permission can be obtained on the spot at the Forest Department office at Mukkali. This trip includes a short trek of about 2-3 km to the hanging bridge at the Kunti River. \n\nThe entry point of the road to the park is Mukkali. From Mukkali, it takes a 30 km jeep ride to get into the actual entry point of the park. Jeeps can be hired from Mukkali. It is difficult for cars to traverse, so don't attempt to drive unless you are adventurous and have an SUV and good skill on mountain roads.\n\nTourists are not allowed to stay in the valley. They must come back to Mukkali by evening.\n\nEntry into the valley is allowed only from 8AM to 2PM, as you need about one and a half hours (each way) to go to the Valley and come back. The Forest Department deliberately does not allow going to the valley early in the morning to minimize disturbance to the animals. Tourists will not be allowed to stay\/camp overnight at the valley.\n\nYou will not be allowed to proceed without a guide. A guide will be assigned to your group when you get permission from the Mukkali Forest Dept Office.\n\nIf you are just a casual tourist, then this is fine, but serious naturalists will have to contact the Wildlife Warden much earlier and get adequate permission. Trekking in deep forest (for a few days) requires permission from the Forest Department office in Trivandrum, and is difficult to get.\n\nAnyhow, it is almost impossible to get permission to go anywhere near the core of the national park, unless you are a field researcher or something like that.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/permits"]},"\nFor Indian citizens, fees are not very high. \nApproximately, they are (in  May 2010):",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\nVehicle (Jeep) rent from Mukkali to the Valley: Rs 650\/-",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\nGuide charges: Rs 150\/-",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\nEntry fee: Rs 50\/- per head",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\nVehicle entry fee: Rs 250\/- per jeep",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\nCameras (still camera): Rs 50\/- per camera",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nJeeps for hire from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mukkali"]]}," (nearest point) or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mannarkkad"]]}," (nearest town).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nEnjoy the thick jungle, see the birds, you are lucky if you see the big mammals (on the short trek).\nMostly you will see the Malabar Giant Squirrel, black langurs and of course many kinds of birds.\nTrek down to the Kunti river.\nThere is also a watch tower overlooking the jungle.\nThe back of the Inspection Bungalow at Mukkali is a great place for bird watching.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nTake a bath in the Bhawani River at Mukkali.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nYou have sairandri restaurant at tree top resort,chindakki near silent valley.
