The first two students to follow his advice were William R.

Soon after, Eastman Kodak, General Electric, Preformed Line Products, Admiral Corporation, Beckman Instruments, Lockheed, Hewlett-Packard, and others followed suit.\n\nStanford Industrial Park was renamed Stanford Research Park in 1974. \n\nBy 2005, Stanford Research Park was home to more than 150 companies in electronics, software, biotechnology, as well a number of top law firms, financial service firms, consultancies, and venture capital companies. R&D and service companies occupied some 10 million square feet in more than 160 buildings on 704 acres. \n\nStanford Research Park is considered by many the foundation of Silicon Valley.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Shockley and Fairchild "]},"\n\nWilliam Shockley was a Bell Labs physicist and one of a group there who got a Nobel Prize for inventing the transistor.

Two of the \"traitorous eight\" who founded Fairchild Semi later started Intel in Sunnyvale. Other \"Fairchildren\" companies include AMD (in Sunnyvale), National Semiconductor (Santa Clara) and Intersil (Milpitas).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Origin of the Name"]},"\n\n\"Silicon Valley\", first used by Don C. Hoefler, publisher of Microelectronics News, in his article titled \"Silicon Valley USA\" on January 11, 1971, has become synonymous with the center of high technology research and development. \"Silicon\" refers to the high concentration of semiconductor and computer-related industries in the area at the time. \"Valley\" refers to the Santa Clara Valley.\n\nSilicon Valley today has extended beyond the greater Santa Clara Valley which includes the entire Santa Clara county and parts of San Mateo, Alameda, and Santa Cruz counties in northern California. It is the southern portion of the San Francisco Bay Area, also known as, South Bay, which covers cities such as San Jose, Santa Clara, Sunnyvale, Cupertino and Los Gatos.

Seeing the headquarters of so many legendary high-tech companies and venture capital firms in one place may be fun at first, especially for techno-geeks, but the novelty wears off after a few hours.  \n\nThe only major Silicon Valley company that openly caters to tourists is Intel.  The Intel Museum is free to the public.  In addition, Apple operates the Apple Company Store at the Apple Campus.  The Company Store lacks some of the products and services found at regular Apple Stores, but is the only store which offers a full line of merchandise (e.g., T-shirts, mugs, etc.) branded with the Apple logo.  \n\nOther major points of interest include the Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose and the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, as well as Stanford University's campus near Palo Alto. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Itineraries"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nSilicon Valley is in the south bay, and is surrounded by many hills.
