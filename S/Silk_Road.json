Around that time there was extensive trade all across the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Persian Empire"]]},", which was centered in what is now ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Iran"]]}," and in those days included much of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Caucasus"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Central Asia"]]}," and what is now ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Turkey"]]},".\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Zhang Qian.jpg"],["thumb"],["Chinese envoy sets off West, 2nd century BCE"]]},"\nAround 300 BCE, Alexander the Great conquered from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Greece"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Egypt"]]},", where he founded ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alexandria"]]}," which later became a great trading city, the main depot for goods from the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Maritime Silk Road"],["Maritime Silk Road"]]}," going to the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mediterranean"]]},". Then he turned East and conquered the Persian Empire and even northern ",{"type":"[[","value":[["India"]]},"; his empire fell apart after his death, but trade continued. He founded what is now the city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Khujand"]]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tajikistan"]]}," and took ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Samarkand"]]},"; both cities later became centers of Silk Road  trade. In the second century BCE envoys from both Alexander's successors and the Chinese court reached ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kashgar"]]},"; this seems to have been the first contact between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Europe"]]},"ans.\n\nFrom that time until the Russian expansion into Central Asia in the 19th century, there was usually some powerful Empire at the center of the Silk Road. The region was conquered by outsiders three times — Alexander, the Arabs in the 7th century CE and the Mongols in the 13th. At other times it was ruled by various incarnations of the Persian Empire or by other empires based in Central Asia, and sometimes these empires included various adjacent regions. Whoever was in charge, trade continued.\n\nWhile Genghis Khan is popularly known as a destructive raider that raped and pillaged his way across Eurasia, the Mongol Empire had a beneficial effect on trade; though they left few great cities, they did leave a lasting mark on both China and Central Asia. By the time of the Great Khan's grandson, Kublai Khan, the Empire covered almost the entire length of the Silk Road from modern Hungary and Turkey to China and Korea. Within the Empire, tariffs were reduced, roads improved, bandits ruthlessly eliminated, and trade and communication encouraged. Europeans, including ",{"type":"[[","value":[["On the trail of Marco Polo"],["Marco Polo"]]}," visited the Mongol capital in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Karakorum"]]}," and China. Travel between Europe and China was faster and safer than it was for centuries afterwards. This trade gradually declined during the Black Plague and the slow decay of the Empire, though successor states ruled by descendants of Genghis kept the road open to some degree well afterwards.\n\nOne Mongol descendant was Tamerlane who ruled much of Central Asia in the 14th century; his palace in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Samarkand"]]},", the Registan, is now a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["World Heritage Site"]]}," and one of the Silk Road's best-known attractions. He was a conqueror who dreamed of rebuilding Genghis's great empire. Tamerlane invaded ",{"type":"[[","value":[["India"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Syria"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Anatolia"]]}," and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Caucasus"]]}," and took cities as diverse as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Delhi"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Damascus"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]},"; he died while en route to attack China. His descendants created the Mughal Dynasty in India. \n\nMuch more than just silk was traded over this route. Trade was restricted to relatively expensive goods — hauling something like rice or lumber over long distances was not economical with medieval transport — but there was quite a variety of those. Porcelain, glass work, fabrics other than silk, other fine craft items, gems, and furs were traded. So were luxury food items, in particular spices. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Coffee"]]},", originally from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ethiopia"]]},", and tea, originally only from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China"]]},", first reached the rest of the world via these routes. In medieval London or Paris, pepper cost more than its weight in gold.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Alfombras turcas.jpg"],["thumb"],["Carpets on sale in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Turkey"]]}]]},"\nCarpets were historically a major trade item and even today, countries along this route produce many fine carpets; these are a major export commodity and a fine thing to bring home as souvenirs. If you ",{"type":"[[","value":[["bargain"]]}," moderately well, they are considerably cheaper here than in other places. There is a phenomenal range available, with each region and sometimes each village producing its own designs. The most finely-woven rugs are produced in the great weaving centers of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Iran"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Turkey"]]},", but areas such as the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Caucasus"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Turkmenistan"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Afghanistan"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Baluchistan"]]}," are also famous for rugs. There is some carpet production almost everywhere from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China"]]}," in the east to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Romania"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Africa"]]}," in the west, and carpet-making is an important industry in both ",{"type":"[[","value":[["India"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pakistan"]]},".\n\nIdeas also traveled this road. Both Islam and Buddhism reached China by this route and some Silk Road areas have important relics of those religions. Important Buddhist sites include the huge statues at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bamian"]]},", Afghanistan (now destroyed), the ancient city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Taxila"]]}," in Pakistan, the large cache of manuscripts found at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gilgit"]]}," in northern Pakistan, and the caves at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dunhuang"]]}," in Xinjiang. One of China's best-known tales is the epic ",{"type":"''","value":["Journey to the West"]},", about a monk and his fantastic companions travelling to India via Xinjiang to bring back Buddhist scriptures. Mosques and other Islamic architecture are found all across ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Central Asia"]]},", much of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South Asia"]]},", and the western provinces of China. There are also some in eastern China, perhaps most notably the fine old mosques in the Silk Road ports ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guangzhou"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Quanzhou"]]},".\n\nOther religions also spread this way; Nestorian Christianity (centered in Persia) sent missionaries as far as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Korea"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Xi'an"]]}," has a stele commemorating their arrival there in the 7th century CE. There were Zoroastrians in Quanzhou by 1000 CE and nearby ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jinjiang"]]}," has the world's last surviving Manichean temple. The first Catholic missionaries reached China by sea in the 14th century, landing at Quanzhou.\n\nVarious ideas from the East — notably Chinese inventions such as gunpowder, window glass and use of coal as fuel — also reached the Islamic countries and then Europe via the Silk Road. Chess reached the West from Persia (\"checkmate\" is from ",{"type":"''","value":["shah mat"]},", Persian for \"king dies\"), though it was likely invented in India.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["On the trail of Marco Polo"],["Marco Polo"]]}," followed this route, reaching China overland via ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Khotan"]]}," and beginning his homeward journey with a ship on the Maritime Silk Road from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Quanzhou"]]}," to Iran.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Prepare"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Central_Asian_Buddhist_Monks.jpeg"],["thumb"],["Buddhist fresco in Xinjiang"]]}," \nThis is not an easy route or one for the novice traveler.

For most countries on this route, travellers with most passports will require ",{"type":"[[","value":[["visa"]]},"s obtained in advance. Planning ahead may be needed to get these since some of the smaller nations have few embassies. For example, Turkmemistan does not have an embassy in Ottawa so a Canadian might need to deal with the embassy in Washington, London, Beijing or Moscow to get a visa. Check country listings for details.\n\nAlmost anyone travelling this route will want to at least look at a lot of carpets, perhaps to buy some of them. Even on a tight budget, one might want to pick up some of the common smaller items such as woven saddlebags or purses and boots decorated with carpet. Reading a book or two on carpets before setting out is a fine idea; among the most useful writers is a California doctor and carpet collector named Murray Eiland.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nMany travelers today follow all or part of this ancient path by train, bus and private car.

Going east from Quetta, the Pakistani rail system is quite good, but the Zahedan-Quetta train runs only twice a month and, as of mid-2014, the area around Quetta is considered quite dangerous.\n\nTo explore just the central part of the road in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Central Asia"]]},", it would be easiest to fly into a city in that area with good air connections — ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tashkent"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Almaty"]]}," or even ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Urumqi"]]},". One could also get into the area on several rail routes branching off from the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Trans-Siberian Railway"]]},", though the main line is north of the major Silk Road routes.\n\nAll of the Silk Road routes travel through areas in which the political (and consequently security) situation can change within the blink of an eye, and really, things were far from perfect to begin with.

This has been vastly reduced over the past two centuries, but there may be risk of new outbreaks when an area becomes chaotic. There are also complications associated with the drug trade; in the last few decades, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Afghanistan"]]}," has become a major source of opium (the raw material for morphine and heroin manufacture); much of it is smuggled north through neighbouring countries then along old Silk Road routes toward ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russia"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Europe"]]},". Piracy does occur in the Gulf of Aden and Southern Red Sea. If you are using the Maritime Silk Road, be cautious of this.\n\nAll that said, with a bit of common sense and goodwill, a willingness to route around trouble spots, and a lot of flexibility on the part of the traveler, the risks are generally quite moderate.\n\nSee individual country and city listings for more.\nRoads are poor in many areas and some are impassable in winter or in monsoon season. Various mountain and desert areas can be quite dangerous if appropriate care is not taken. So can some of the inhabitants. Most are friendly, curious and helpful, but the traveler needs some understanding of local customs and must take some care not to give offense.\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["guideitinerary"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Silk Road"]]}]
