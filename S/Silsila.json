The locality seems to have formed a natural obstacle to otherwise sedate river traffic, probably reflected in its ancient Egyptian name ",{"type":"''","value":["Khenu"]},", translated as \"the Place of Rowing\".\n\nGeologically, this gorge marks the point at which the underlying bedrock of Egypt changes from limestone to sandstone. The high quality sandstones at this locality, much in demand, were quarried for centuries during the Pharaonic period and - having been transported up and down the river - were employed in monumental structures the length of Egypt. By the later Ptolemaic and Roman periods, tens of thousands of workers were employed here each year quarrying building stone.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nIf you are able to travel with a private vehicle, perhaps with Egyptian friends or colleagues, this offers probably the most convenient option for visiting the locality\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\n\nTaxi drivers are currently reluctant to stop at Silsila, owing to the prevailing security demands and schedule posed by the local Tourist Police (considered by many to be unwarranted, but there to be dealt with nonetheless).
