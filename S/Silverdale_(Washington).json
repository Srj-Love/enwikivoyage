Centrally located near, Bremerton, Poulsbo and Port Orchard, Silverdale is a convenient place to visit.  On the shores of Dyes Inlet Silverdale is also accessible by the water and offers many great views of the area.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nNative American Salish people lived comfortably in the Puget Sound area navigating the local waterways in well made cedar canoes for thousands of years and developed a complex ritualistic society before 1792 when Captain George Vancouver 'discovered' the area, named it after one of his officers and declared the area for Great Briton.\n\nOnce the Washington Territory was established in 1853, the U.S. government began signing treaties with area tribes to acquire their lands. The Suquamish people ceded most of their land around the Kitsap Peninsula to the United States and logging came into the area in full force. The areas once impassible thick forests gave way to farms, towns and industry as lumber was shipped off to areas such as San Francisco or burned as fuel for the growing fleet of boats known as the Mosquito Fleet.\n\nIt was loggers who settled in Silverdale in 1854.  They expanded their operations into the valleys of Kitsap County, building roads as they went.  By the 1880s, Scandinavian immigrants were moving into the area seeking work.  As the timber production took the prime trees and opened up large areas, attention turned to farming.\n\nFarming conditions were excellent and the family farms thrived.  The Farmer's Cooperative was formed in 1887.  Dairy, chicken and hog farms abounded even through the middle 20th century.\n\nThe town was named in 1878.  Settler William Littlewood wanted to name the town Goldendale, but it turned out that another town bore that name. Instead of trying to find an entirely new name, he changed the \"gold\" to \"silver\" and named it Silverdale.\n\nIn the mid 1880s steamer boats began making regular trips to Seattle from the Kitsap area and by 1900 the sloop \"Telka\" departed Silverdale for Seattle once a week.  While the Silverdale Dock was the center of entertainment and commercial trade well into the 1900s, the community remained a fairly quiet, family-oriented town.  Remnants of its beginnings as an agricultural and timber center can be found at places such as the Old Mill Site on Bucklin Hill Rd.\n\nThe announcement by the Navy that it would develop its West Coast Trident Submarine Base at Bangor, caused a rush of change in the community as more people moved in to the area and businesses moved into the region to support the growing population.\nSeveral attempts towards city-hood have been defeated, leaving the community an unincorporated part of the county overseen by a Commissioner, elected to a Board of three serving from the county seat in Port Orchard.\n\nSilverdale managed to enter the 21st century with some undeveloped land -- pastures, roaming deer and old-time barns. You can also still find a solitary, tree-lined avenue or a quiet park. In fact, relaxing spots can be found in the Silverdale waterfront park, on the Clear Creek Trail and Island Lake County park.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By car "]},"\n\nIf you are coming from East Bremerton, then, take WA-303 north, and, when you cross over the Brownsville Hwy intersection, you will enter a short expressway with exits like Central Valley Blvd, Ridgetop Blvd etc. And, at the end of the expressway is WA-3 interchange, and also, you can take WA-3 if you are from Poulsbo.
