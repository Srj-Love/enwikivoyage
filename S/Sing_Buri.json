On the west bank of the Chao Phraya River, about 142 km from Bangkok, it has an area of around 841 sq km. Geographically, it is a basin where three rivers, the Chao Phraya, Noi, and Lop Buri, flow through. Somdet Khrom Phraya Damrong Rajanuphab described the city thus, \"Sing Buri is an ancient and large city with a fortress, a royal palace, and Wat Maha That\". The reclining Chakkrasi Buddha image is larger than others in Thailand. It is an imitation of the Indian Buddha image, like the one at a cave in Yala province. Sing Buri was called by different names: the city of Singha Rachathirat or the city of Singha Racha. The city sits by the Chakkrasi, a large river 200 sen (Thai measurement equivalent to 40 m) away from the Chao Phraya River. Since the Chakkrasi River has been shallow, the city of Sing Buri has become a mysterious city. The city of Sing Buri was established as Sing Buri Province in 1895 during the reign of King Rama V. \n\nAmong the charms of Sing Buri, many roads in the town of Sing Buri are named after the heroes of the Bang Rachan village, such as Nai Thaen, Nai Dok, Nai In, Nai Mueang, Khun San, etc. Besides, there are a great number of Buddhist temples, both of the old and new ages.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By car "]},"\nFrom Bangkok, there are two routes:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["Take Hwy 1 (Phahonyothin Rd) and, at km52, switch to Hwy 32 (Asian Hwy), past Bang Pa-in in Ayutthaya.
