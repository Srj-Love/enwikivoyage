The national ticket booths are next to the entry to the pier and a ticket to Pulau Lingga is Rp 113,000 (Nov 2009). Add an extra Rp 3,000 for the sea port tax and then board the ferry. Some of the ferries has numbered seats but otherwises just pick a seat; outdoor or indoor. You may even make your way up to sit next to the captain, an area frequently used when the ship is full (i.e. the double amount of people than there are seats). \n\nThe ferry steers it way south stopping a couple of times on small islands on the way. Then arriving to Jago on Singkep before its last stop on Lingga. The port on Lingga is callad Tanjung Buton (Tanjung, Tg. means Cape). In the port you will find motor bike taxis (\"ojek\") and the ride to Daik is about 10 minutes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nCars are not very common and the local transportation consist of motor bike taxis known as \"ojek\". \n\nTry to rent your own motor bike to easily get around. Ask for \"rental moto\" and pay between Rp 50,000-100,000 per day. On the smaller islands the prices are much higher and expect to pay Rp 10,000 for one bottle of petrol (price on mainland Rp 4,500). The bottles of petrol are bought next to the roads from local people and there are often many places even in the most remote villages. \n\nTo get between Singkep and Lingga there are two alternatives; one power boat that frequents the 20-30 minutes ride a few times a day. However; the schedule is confusing so the second alternative is to ask a local fisherman to get a ride in his boat. A good price for that ride would be around Rp 60,000.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nResun Waterfall\nPasir Panjang \nSmall fishing villages: Kelume, Kedo, \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Itineraries"]},"\nSunrise a 6.00 o'clock and the time you must get up to get the most of you visit to these remote islands.
