The temple there was founded by Yeshi Tsogyal, and Guru Rinpoche visited the region on his second visit to Bhutan. However, partly due to the fact that the valley is located in a sensitive area near the border and also partly due to Bhutan wishing to preserve the sanctity of its sacred sites, the valley is not open for tourists.\n\nDue to mud in the summer and snow during the winter and spring, the only time the paths are accessible is during October. \n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nHimalayan\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n- a three day walk from the village of Khoma\n",{"type":"==","value":["Fees\/Permits"]},"\nSpecial permits are required, but tourists are not allowed to visit the area.\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\non foot\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nAll provisions must be carried in.
