While this is a big claim, the diving here is certainly world class. Sipadan used to have resorts but to protect the environment these were closed around the year 2002. To dive on Sipadan you have to stay somewhere nearby, such as on Mabul or in Semporna, and take a boat onto the island.\n\nBecause Sipadan is now a protected site, only 120 dives are allowed daily (as of Aug 2008). It's best to try to dive as early as possible to beat the crowds and increase your chances of getting on the roster to dive.\n\nFrom the main beach of the original resort it is a mere 20m wade over the reef to reach the top of the reef wall dropping 1,000-2,000 m. Sipadan is surrounded by very rich reef life consisting of both hard and soft coral as well as all manner of reef fish. Sea turtles and white tip reef sharks can be seen on almost every dive and hammerhead and leopard sharks can also be seen at times. Visibility ranges from 10m to 30m and above.\n\nA barge accident on 15 May 2006 did some damage to the reefs at Sipadan, crushing a portion of reef on the old pier and Barracuda Point and dumping its cargo of gravel in the area. This was not one of the best dive areas, but clean-up operations and other repercussions did restrict diving in the months since.\n\nThe rate for three dives at Sipadan is around RM560. Rates vary slightly among different operators. Boat transfers and packed lunch are included. Permits are limited to 120 per day and are typically obtained by the dive operators. You should verify that the diver operator you choose is diving at Sipadan with permits, as some companies have been caught diving the island recently without permits.\n\nCheck diver reviews of dive operators in the area before choosing.  Many have had customer complaints regarding faulty equipment.\n\nDive shops include:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Big John Scuba"],["alt="],["url="],["email=bigjohnlim@hotmail.com"],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Office located in Semporna near Dragon Inn resort."],["phone=+60 14 284 3723."],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Located on Mabul Island.

Note that currents and boat traffic (especially if duck diving) are the major hazards in the offshore areas, and cryptically coloured stone fish may be a hazard in the shallows.\n\nA buoyed-off area from the 'safe' side of the jetty gives snorkellers the safest and potentially most productive snorkeling area.
