Even during the busy summer peak, Sitia retains a certain charm and laid-back style. On the other hand, this means that it is not deserted in the winter, like other tourist resorts of Crete.\n\nDuring the Venetian occupation the town of Sitia was destroyed three times. In 1508 by a terrible earthquake, in 1538 by the pirate Barbarosa and in 1651 by the Venetians so as not to fall in the hands of the Turks. For two centuries Sitia ceased to exist as a town, until 1869. The present city was built in 1870.\n\nSitia is the seat of administrative and public services for the county.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nSitia has an airport with connection to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Athens"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kassos"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Karpathos"]]},",",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rhodes"]]}," and some charter flights abroad.\n\nScheduled services\n\n",{"type":"''","value":["Domestic:"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Olympic Air from Alexandroupolis, Athens, Karpathos and Preveza-Lefkas"]},{"type":"*","value":["Sky Express from Athens and Heraklion"]},{"type":"*","value":["Athens Airways from Alexandroupolis and Preveza-Lefcas"]},{"type":"''","value":["International:"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":["Hamburg International from Hamburg (begins summer 2010)"]},{"type":"*","value":["XL Airways Germany from Düsseldorf and Munich (begins summer 2010)"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\nSitia has road and sea connections with various places in the island and with Pireaus and other Aegean islands.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nIt has been inhabited since the Minoan period.
