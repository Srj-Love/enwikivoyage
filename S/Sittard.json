Sittard is part of the municipality of Sittard-Geleen.\n\nSittard has a small historic city centre with numerous architectural monuments, including several old churches (St Peter's, St Michael's, Basilica of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart) and a few half-timbered houses. The city has retained part of its city wall. On the south-eastern side of the city centre, the St Rosa chapel crowns the Kollenberg hill. Museum \"Het Domein\" is situated in a converted nineteenth century school building in the city centre. It focuses on contemporary art, urban history and archeology.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=VVV Sittard Tourist Office"],["url=http:\/\/www.vvvzuidlimburg.nl\/"],["email="],["address=Rosmolenstraat 2"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone = +31 900-555 9798"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Mo 1:00PM - 5:30 PM, Tu-Fr 10:00AM-5:30PM, Sa 10:00Am-4:00PM"],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nThe main train station is located at a 10 minutes walk from the city center.
