Although it is neither the biggest nor the most attractive of the Sporades islands, because it is the first port of call for most ferries and possesses the sole airport, most tourists don't venture beyond Skiathos. For most, why would they want to? There are great beaches, good accommodation on offer, decent public transport... But be warned, the 5000 or so natives are vastly outnumbered in season by tourists from across the world!\n\nWhile it is undoubtedly the most tourist-intensive island of the Sporades, it does have many faces, so don’t be fooled by the brash cover to this book full of splendid Greek secrets.  Steer away from the main drag and you will find stunning scenery, quaint tavernas and lots of luscious green terrain perfect for gentle strolls or more intensive hikes.\n\nThere is one town on Skiathos which is literally called \"The Village\" by the locals, or Skiathos town. It is located on the east end of the island with the airport, port, a variety of shops and water fronts, bars and clubs.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\nSkiathos is accessible via ferry from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Volos"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Agios Konstantinos"]]},", and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Thessaloniki"]]},".

The airport is situated  north-east of Chora.  It is served from Greek destinations by Olympic Airways, and from northern European destinations in summer months by charter and some regular scheduled airlines (currently including Austrian Airlines,) usually only once or twice a week.\n\nThe runway is an excitement in itself; as you descend towards Skiathos you are met with sea, sea and more sea before out of nowhere appears a precarious strip of runway across the end of this small island.  If the pilot misses his spot, you’ll have to circle and try again!\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Skiathos Street.jpg"],["right"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Street in Skiathos town"]]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nPublic buses operate on one line that runs from the port to Koukouniares along the southern side of the island.

Stops are marked with a sign and a number.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\nTaxis are easy to get from the port to anywhere on the island.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car or motorbike"]},"\nIt is not worth the hassle to bring your own car to the island, although it is in theory possible. You can rent a car or a motor scooter. Asphalt roads run across the south of the island. Roads in the interior turn out to be little more than dirt paths.\n\nMotorbikes and mopeds are popular alternatives to cars. Especially mopeds are frequently used by local youths and can go to many places that cars cannot go - for example the twisted narrow streets of Skiathos city. An additional advantage is that they are cheap to rent - €10-15 a day is the usual price.\n\nIf you start a day-trip with a moped, make you sure you do so on a full tank, as gas stations are sometimes hard to find. An extra stop at a gas station can save a lot of nerves. When renting a moped, check if the profile of the tyres is ok if the brakes work properly,lights,turn indicators and petrol gauge. If it doesn't look good don't be bothered to rent it, it could be the one that needs a repair badly. it can cause you a lot of troubles if it breaks down.Make sure the insurance stands on the contract.  Helmets are required on Skiathos.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=The First Rent a Car and Motorbike"],["url=http:\/\/www.skiathoshire.com"],["email=info@skiathoshire.com"],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+30 24270 22810, +30 6942443165"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Delivers and picks up your car\/motorbike to and from the airport, Skiathos Harbour or your hotel.
