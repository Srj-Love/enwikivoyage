Regardless of the direction you are arriving from, the infamously ugly apartment buildings constructed after the 1963 earthquake which ravaged the city will welcome you, and, while the fans of the stereotypical Eastern Europe may find a thing or two to check out in this Sovietesque city, you may feel largely unwelcome, but don't give up on Skopje so soon.\n\nInstead of fantasizing about hopping on the next bus to somewhere else, head to the central square, divided in two by the River Vardar, which is crossed by a 14th-century stone bridge. This is the focal point of the \"Skopje 2014\" project, where the Macedonian government proudly erects almost innumerable statues of the historical personalities with a relation to Macedonia, and some huge neo-classical buildings in an apparent effort to invoke a feeling for the glorious days of the Ancient Macedon.\n\nWhen you filled your daily quota of seeing sculptures (which will be pretty soon), walk up to the Ottoman old town, to the serene yards of the medieval mosques to relieve your eyes of the statue fatigue. It should be evening by now, and your legs should be tired enough—just about the right time to look for one of the small squares of the old town shadowed by huge, old plane trees, and to sit and reflect there, together with a bottle of the tasty local beer, Skopsko.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Skopje-pano.JPG"],["350px"],["thumb"],["Skopje city panorama, with Mount Vodno in the background"]]},"\n\nIn the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Povardarie"]]}," region, Skopje is the financial and political center of Macedonia and by far its biggest city. The city population is around 800,000, however unofficially during working-days it can almost reach more than 1 million, which is more than half of the population of the country. The most divers in the country, Skopje houses many ethnicities; besides the majority Macedonians, many Albanians, Turks, Roma, Serbs, Bosniaks and others call Skopje home.\n\nThe 26th of July 1963 is one of the worst dates in the history of Skopje. An earthquake struck the city at 5:17AM. 75% of the buildings in the city disappeared in just a few seconds. After that, the big rebuilding project began, trying to make Skopje the model city of the socialist world. The plan was drawn by the Japanese architect Kenzo Tange, who also designed the new railway station. The plan was never fully carried out. Lately many reconstruction projects have started. Some towers of Kale Fortress and the old cathedral are being reconstructed, and the old theater is also under reconstruction. Skopje is an eclectic mix of Christian and Islamic culture, with both vying to make themselves visible. However, this cultural mix has also spawned a lively and varied society. You can see people playing chess in the morning in the numerous cafés and green spaces in the summer. In the evening, Skopje comes to life as the locals dine in the cafés before heading to the bars and live music clubs, most of which are open until 1AM or later.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nApart from being the capital of the Republic of Macedonia, Skopje has always been a center of power long coveted by various empires, and occupied by a long list of them, evident by the several Byzantine churches and monasteries around the city, also by a few Roman sites, such as Scupi and Skopje's Aqueduct. The city founded by the Paeonians in the 3rd century B.C.E. under the name of ‘Skupi’ was prized for its strategic location, in a long valley between two hills, situated on the banks of the Vardar River, a vital trade route. Under the Romans, Skopje was made administrative center of the Dardanian Province. The city’s prestige grew when the Orthodox Church made it an episcopal seat during the early Byzantine Empire. The arrival of migrating Slavic tribes from the Carpathians in the 6th century C.E. changed both the city’s name and the composition of its people were assimilated by the Slavic newcomers. Throughout the remaining Byzantine centuries, Skopje continued to be an important mercantile center, situated as it was at the crossroads of Balkan trade and communications routes. It was celebrated for its urban life and fortress, and renowned for having the most beautiful church in the region. In 14th century, Skopje became the capital of the Empire of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Serbia"]]},", which was one of the largest and strongest countries in Europe during that period. However, the group that left the greatest mark on Skopje were the Ottomans. At the very end of the 14th century, Skopje and all of Macedonia fell under the rule of the Ottoman Turks, who ruled Macedonia for over six hundred years and built a large number of mosques and other buildings. In the ensuing centuries, the look of the town changed with the construction of many mosques, Turkish baths, bridges, and other buildings attesting to the new Oriental influence. Today, the Ottoman legacy remains extremely visible in Skopje’s architecture and small Islamic minority. After Macedonia was liberated from the Turks in the early 20th century, became a part of Kingdom of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Serbia"]]},", then it became a republic of the Yugoslav Federation, with Skopje as the capital. At that time, the prosperous city boasted many ornate, Neoclassical buildings laid out harmoniously in a more or less Central European style. However, in 1963 a disastrous earthquake leveled much of the regal old city, and Skopje was reborn in the imaginative, futuristic style in vogue at the time. Today, Skopje is a modern city and Macedonia’s major political, economical, educational, and cultural center.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Skopje \"Alexander the Great\" Airport"],["alt=",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["SKP"]]}],["url=http:\/\/skp.airports.com.mk\/default.aspx?ItemID=345"],["email="],["address="],["lat=41.95649"],["long=21.62872"],["directions= SE 20 km"],["phone="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"Transport options include:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["By bus: ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.vardarexpress.com\/index.php?id=28&L=2 Vardar Express"]}]}," From the new terminal, there are buses running into Skopje operated by Vardar Express transport company; a timetable can be seen on the company's website, but a rule of thumb is that the buses depart about 10-15 minutes after a landing, just outside of the exit gates.

There is a small museum about him in the buildings around the courtyard (you have to enter the museum to buy a ticket for the church). Among the paving of the courtyard there are some 18th and 19th century gravestones. Turks didn’t allow building of new churches during their occupation, but as the empire was weakening in the 18th century they started giving permits for building of churches to keep the population happy. There were many rules to be followed like the exterior had to be without decorations and the floor of the church had to be at least one meter below the ground so the church wouldn’t dominate the skyline of the city. St. Saviour Church is example of one of these churches. It was built in the beginning of 19th century on the site of a church destroyed in the 1689 fire (as you enter, turn right to see remains of the frescoes and the level of the earlier church). The church is famous for its interior and wood carving. The iconscreen is work of Petre Filipovski Garkata and Marko and Makarie Frckovski, the best wood artists in the 19th century in Macedonia. In 1926 a British museum offered a blank check for the iconscreen, the state to fill in the amount if they decide to sell it. The beauty of it is that it is a deep wood carving from whole wood boards (the figures are not attached to each other), and it is not covered with golden paint, as it is tradition in Orthodox churches so the game of light and dark shades is quite dramatic (the doors into the altar and the cross on the top are covered with gold paint, so you can compare). The iconscreen was made from 1819 to 1824 and is 10 meters long and 7 meters high. There are scenes from the old and the new testament. The figurines are 7 cm tall. Look for the creation of Adam and Eve on one of the columns next to the doors of the altar and the dance of Salome, where she dances for king Irod so he would give her the head of St.John the Baptist (she is dressed in traditional a dress from Galichnik). All around there are flowers and animals typical for the region presented. On the far right look for the self-portrait of the artists presented as they are working on the icon screen.
