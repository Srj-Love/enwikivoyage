It is where one will find the most hotels, rental apartments, restaurants, bars, shops and clubs.\n\nSliema and St Julian's form a near continuous town spread over two adjacent peninsulas with St Julian's to the north (about 20 minutes walk) and Valetta and a third peninsula to the south (about 20 minutes drive).\n\nMalta is a very Catholic country and its people are some of the friendliest and most embracing of tourists in Europe. It is important to note though that certain behavior is strongly frowned upon (such as excessive drunken raucous behavior) and other behavior is illegal (such as topless sunbathing) despite this town being a common tourist area.\n\nStreet names in Malta are written first in Maltese then in English, it becomes helpful to learn both since some people only use one or the other when giving directions and some maps only give the Maltese (on the assumption that the reader will be able to translate).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nThe area is well signposted from Valetta and the international airport and is about 20 minutes drive from Valletta and 1 hour from the airport.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nThe bus service is now run by Arriva (www.arriva.com.mt), most buses are air conditioned (a great benefit over the old buses!). A Day ticket costs €2.60 & can be used as often as you wish on any route during the day of purchase.\n\nBuses for Sliema leave the Valletta terminus regularly. Be warned that the Valletta - Sliema\/St.Julians routes can get quite crowded in the summer months. A number 12, 13 or 14 will take you to Sliema & St Julians.\n\nThe bus routes are very much concentric to Valletta, such that if you wish to travel from Sliema to another part of the Island (in any direction) it will often be necessary first to travel into Valletta then back out again.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\n\nA ferry regularly (each half hour between 8am and 6pm and later on special occasions such as Notto Bianco) crosses the harbour between Sliema and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Valletta"]]},". A one-way ticket for the five-minute journey costs about €1.20; there are also two or three water taxis plying the same route. Whichever you use, be aware that on the Valletta side there is quite a climb up to the centre of the city.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nThe town is a mostly residential area and as such tourists would tend to travel outside of Sliema during holiday. \n\nHowever, there are a number of excellent restaurants in and around Howard Street and a tiny supermarket just off Stella Maris Street. \n\nThe sea front is well developed and offers shaded seating areas often with free wireless internet, an array of cafes, bars and restaurants and some stone beaches with safe and clean swimming areas.\n\nSliema is one of the largest and most modern shopping centres in Malta : see 'Buy' below.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Learn"]},"\n\nSeveral of Malta's English language schools are located here.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Work"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nThis is Malta's largest and most modern shopping district. You'll find several streets packed full of shops, including international favourites like Zara, Top Shop and Mango, as well as a variety of many designer labels. Malta's prices aren't anything to be excited about, but if you're looking for something trendy, possibly from a store that's more uncommon outside Europe, this is where you'll find it. There is also a small Marks and Spencers, but this one does not have a deli section.\n\nThe latest addition to Sliema shopping is The Point mall at Point Tigne, a three-level, air conditioned mall with a supermarket, cafes & many designer outlets.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Budget"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Offshore."]}," A small coffee shop on the Strand with the best cakes and coffee in Sliema."]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Mid-range"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ta' Kris."]}," Tucked away in a little alley off Bisazza Street, the main shopping thoroughfare, this is one of the best places on the island for Maltese cuisine."]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Splurge"]},"\nBaracuda in Baluta Bay has some of best food around.
