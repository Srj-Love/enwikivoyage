Despite its small size, Slovenia has a surprising variety of terrain, ranging from the beaches of the Mediterranean to the peaks of the Julian Alps, to the rolling hills of the south. Slovenia was already more economically advanced than other nations behind the iron curtain prior to European integration and the powerhouse of Tito's Yugoslavia. Contrary to the popular misconception, Slovenia was not a part of the Eastern bloc (not after the Yugoslavian notorious split with the Soviet Union in 1948). Added the fact that Slovenia is also home to some of the finest scenery in the \"New Europe\", the transition from socialism to the European common market economy has gone well and serves as a model for other nations on the same track to follow.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nSlavic ancestors of Slovenians came from eastern parts of Europe and inhabited territory north of present Slovenian territory in the 6th century AD. They established a state called Caranthania (",{"type":"''","value":["Karantanija"]}," in Slovene), which was an early example of parliamentary democracy in Europe. The ruler (",{"type":"''","value":["knez"]}," in Slovene) was elected by popular vote. The Caranthanians were later defeated by Bavarians and Franks, who subjugated them. They were Christianized, but they preserved many rituals of their pagan religion, and above all, they preserved their native language. The Slovene lands were part of the Holy Roman Empire and Austria under the Habsburg dynasty until 1918, when the Slovenes joined the Serbs and Croats in forming a new south-Slavic state ruled by Serbian Karađorđević dynasty called the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians"]}," (\"Kraljevina Srbov, Hrvatov in Slovencev\" in Slovene), renamed Yugoslavia in 1929. In WWII, Slovenia was invaded and occupied by Germans, Italians and Hungarians, leading to a parallel civil war between pro-communist liberation forces (Partizani) and axis-sponsored anti-communist reactionary factions (\"Belogardisti\" and Domobranci). The victory of the Allies and consequently the Partizans resulted in a violent mass exodus of those who had fought with the occupying forces, including most of the native German and Italian minorities. After World War II, Slovenia became a republic in the reestablished Yugoslavia, which although Communist, distanced itself from the Soviet bloc and small territorial gains were made from Italy. Dissatisfied with the exercise of power in Belgrade, the Slovenes succeeded in establishing their independence in 1991 with minimal bloodshed. In 2004, Slovenia joined the European Union and NATO.

Lunch sets (",{"type":"''","value":["dnevno kosilo"]},") cost around €7 for three courses (soup, salad and main) and the large portions are usually well worth the paltry cost.\n\nFast food is, invariably, cheap, greasy and (more often than not) terrible.

There is no real Slovenian fast food, but Slovenians have adopted greasy Balkan grills like ",{"type":"''","value":["pleskavica"]}," (a spiced-up hamburger patty) and ",{"type":"''","value":["čevapčiči"]}," (spicy meatballs) are ubiquitous, but one of the more tasty if not healthy options is the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bosnia"]]},"n speciality ",{"type":"''","value":["burek"]},", a large, flaky pastry stuffed with either meat (",{"type":"''","value":["mesni"]},"), cheese (",{"type":"''","value":["sirni"]},") or apple (",{"type":"''","value":["jabolčni"]},"), often sold for as little as €2.

It is wise to know that even the smallest store has its healthy food shelves with many non-animal alternatives. In the cities the Mediterranean chick-pea staple falafel and its cousin the vegiburger have made some inroads on fast-food menus.

Coffee culture is widespread in Slovenia, and one can see Slovenes with friends sitting in the same café for hours. When invited to a cup of coffee at someone's home, expect turkish coffee. Tea (",{"type":"''","value":["čaj"]},") is nowhere near as popular, and if they do drink it (mostly in the winter), Slovenes prefer all sorts of fruit-flavored and herbal teas over a basic black cup.

Ask for ",{"type":"''","value":["veliko"]}," (large) for 0.5L and ",{"type":"''","value":["malo"]}," (small) for 0.3L.

Generally, the Goriška brda region produces the best reds and the drier whites (in a more Italian\/French style), while the Štajerska region produces the best semi-dry to sweet whites, which cater more to the German\/Austrian-type of palate. Other local specialities worth sampling are ",{"type":"'''","value":["Teran"]},", a very dry red from the Kras region, and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cviček"]},", a red so dry and light it's almost a rosé.

Information about these huts can be found at tourist information offices who will also help you plan your walks around the area and phone the hostels to book them for you. The only way to get to the huts is by foot, and expect a fair bit of walking up hills, as the lowest huts are around 700m up.

Hygiene standards are high and tap water is potable.\n\nWhile in nature, always use tick repellents, due to the Borreliosis and Meningitis danger. Borreliosis is very widespread in the country.\n\nThere are two species of venomous adders in the Julian Alps. You are unlikely to be bitten, but if you are, you should seek medical help as antiserums are available (although actually seldom administered). In the forests in the south, you may encounter a bear; Slovenia contains the highest bear population in Europe, but attacks are very rare. Normally, in countries that have been domesticated for several thousand years, the indigenous wild fauna will be either very skittish or very comfortable with humans. It depends on the area you are in, of course, but use your head. If you go camping in the Julian Alps and bring a lot of sausage and bacon, chances are you will attract some unwanted visitors.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Respect"]},"\nSlovenians are generally open and friendly, so don't hesitate to address people as those younger than 50 understand English and will be eager to help you. You will impress them if you try using some basic Slovenian words.

Don't worry unnecessarily, but still you should take some normal precautions to study your host first.\n\nSlovenians are proud for having preserved their national identity (especially the language) in spite of the pressures from neighboring nations in past centuries. Due to their economic success as well as historical and contemporary cultural bonds to Central Europe, they usually don't like their country to be described as part of \"Eastern Europe\". While Slovenian is closely related to Serbian and Croatian, it is not the same language. Another common misconception is that Slovenia was part of the Soviet Bloc, while it was in fact the northernmost country of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yugoslavia"]]},". You can, however, freely discuss these topics; just be aware that you can hear contrasting sides of the story, depending on who you talk to and his\/her political affinity. There is still a strong division among leftists and rightists. Be careful if entering a discussion on open territorial issues with Croatia or on the Slovenian civil war during WWII and its aftermath. Consider these controversial topics a taboo.\n\nThere is an active lesbian and gay scene in Slovenia. As elsewhere in this part of Europe, homosexuals are generally safe, although there have been a few reported attacks in the past. Be cautious in the evening and during the night, especially in cities.

Two major Slovenian mobile companies, Mobitel and Simobil, provide an excellent coverage in GSM and 3G, but 3G can be unavailable in mountainous regions. Roaming between European phone companies is becoming cheaper due to the EU regulation setting a maximum of 0.29€ per minute for calls made and 0.09€ for calls received, while calls to or from non-EU providers remain expensive.
