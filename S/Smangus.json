The system of communal management draws on traditional Atayal culture and ideas from other sources including the Israeli kibbutz.\n\nBefore the giant trees in the area were discovered, Smangus was completely cut off from the outside world. The fact that it is so far removed from \"civilization\" does nothing but promote an air of mystery about the area and the people who live there, which is why it was once known as \"Black Village\". It is now known as \"God's Village\".\n\nAs far as modern conveniences go, the village has had an interesting history of development. The area didn't have electricity until 1979. Their homes are made mostly of wood or bamboo, in stark contrast to their city counterparts. Making the community even more remote is the fact that the only road to the outside world wasn't even completed until 1995. Before that, the closest road was on the other side of the valley and people had to carry anything they couldn't make in the village on their backs. Children also had to walk three hours across the valley to go to school.\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\nThe village sits on a ridge at 1,500 metres above the Takechin Creek.\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\nBamboo forests, ancient cypress trees.\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nBecause of the altitude it gets cold at nights and during winter.
