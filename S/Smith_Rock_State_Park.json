The area is well known for its challenging climbing routes so eventually all top climbers visit.  In 1983, Allan Watts began to use sport climbing ethics which pushed American climbing to new levels.  Shortly after, between 1992 and 2009, about 500 new climbing routes were added. This brought climbers from all over the world as Smith Rock became the world capital for sport climbing. To this day the park still attracts climbers from all over the world. The best time to visit is fall and late spring. The winter tends to be too cold (below freezing) and the summer months regularly reach the 100s °F (40s °C).\n\nIn addition to the world-famous rock climbing, Smith Rock State Park is host to many miles of hiking trails, the meandering Crooked River and views of the volcanic peaks of Oregon's Cascade Range.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Lodging"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Camping"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Smith Rock, Jo Boje (6501978545).jpg"],["thumb"],["Sunset in the park"]]},"\nThere are two camping options available. One is in the park's bivouac area at the southern boundary of the park, while the other is the Skull Hollow Campground located several miles from the park. Camping at the bivouac is $5 per person, per day. There is hot water, showers, bathrooms, and many campsites to choose from. The park asks all bivouac users to keep all food out of campsites and in the communal kitchen area. Skull Hollow campground is 5 miles east of the park and runs along a Forest Service road. Although it is free, there is no running water and it is farther from the park.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Backcountry"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinepark"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["44.3698"],["-121.1379"],["zoom=15"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Central Oregon"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Smith Rock State Park"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Smith Rock State Park"]]}]
