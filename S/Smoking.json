In particular, long air journeys can make heavy smokers downright miserable, especially since large parts of most airports are non-smoking as well. The withdrawal symptoms are quite genuine, and reflecting that the addiction is self-inflicted just makes it worse.\n\nMany travelling smokers just suffer through this or try to sleep. Some dose themselves with tranquilizers or large amounts of alcohol, which may help some but is not recommended since those substances have their own dangers â in fact, mixing booze and tranquilizers can be fatal â and it is a very bad idea to be stoned when trying to deal with border controls at the destination.\n\nA better solution is to look on a long flight as an opportunity to quit. If you can resist the urge to light up the instant that becomes possible on arrival â instead go shopping, sightseeing or partying, or just fall over and sleep off the jet lag â then you are well on your way to quitting. The first few days are far the worst and a flight gets you through one day without requiring any willpower (won't power?) from you. Consider going the rest of the way yourself.\n\nWhether or not you are quitting, it is a good idea to carry nicotine gum for long flights. Heavy smokers who travel a lot should just leave a pack of this permanently in their favorite piece of hand luggage. The gum is marketed mainly as an aid to quitting, a way to reduce nicotine addiction pangs in new non-smokers. However, it can also be used by unrepentant addicts to help deal with long flights. Chewing any sort of gum also reduces the chance of ear problems due to pressure changes during a flight.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Prevalence of tobacco consumption"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["PartOfTopic"],["Concerns"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinetopic"]]}]
