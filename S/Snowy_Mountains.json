The ideas behind the scheme is to divert the winter snowmelt waters westward into the Murrumbidgee rivers, irrigating large parts of inland Australia and at the same time generating Hydro-Electricity.  There are several large lakes, tunnels, and Hydro power stations that form part of the scheme that you can visit. Tours take visitors a kilometre into the mountainside and offer a vivid insight into the sheer scope of this iconic part of the nation's post-war development.\n\nYou can see the headwaters of the Murray River at Tom Groggin, along the Alpine Way between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Thredbo"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Khancoban"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]}," \n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Mount Blue Cow.jpg"],["thumb"],["Snowboarders and skiiers at Mount Blue Cow, part of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Perisher"]]}," Resort"]]},"\n\nThe mountains are beautiful year round and the region annually attracts some three million visitors seeking nature-based and adventure holidays.\n\nWhether you're after a rugged back-to-nature experience, want to be cosseted in alpine splendor or simply feel like going somewhere beautiful, diverse and interesting with the whole family, the chances are high that you'll find it in the Snowy Mountains.
