One group had platted a town site and called it Siloam in 1905; while another faction named their town-to-be Cottage City on 1908. The name Soap Lake came from the word Smokiam, an Indian term which translates to “Healing Waters.” The tribes used the lake for healing purposes for themselves and their animals for many years before the area was settled by pioneers.\nAt that time, Soap Lake was already a busy resort and health spa. It contained four hotels and many rooming houses and businesses catering to sojourners seeking a cure. The residents were very proud of the two-room schoolhouse built in 1907. Even though Soap Lake’s main industry was derived from the medicinal lake, it became a social center. In its heyday celebrations, socials, and gatherings where held continuously. Especially well known were the open-air dances, which would draw participants from miles around.\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:South shore of Soap Lake.jpg"],["250px"],["thumbnail"],["South shore of Soap Lake"]]},"\nSoap Lake is a meromictic soda lake in the town of Soap Lake, Washington formed by the Missoula Floods at the foot of the Grand Coulee. The lake gets its name from the naturally occurring foam that gives its water a soapy appearance, and because the lake's mineral-rich waters have a slick, soapy feel. \n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox"],["image1=WA-17.svg"],["imagesize1=22"],["directionl1=N"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brewster (Washington)"],["Brewster"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sun Lakes-Dry Falls State Park"],["Sun Lakes-Dry Falls S.P."]]}],["directionr1=S"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mesa (Washington)"],["Mesa"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moses Lake"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Columbia River Plateau"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Soap Lake, Washington"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["47.388333333333"],["-119.4875"]]}]
