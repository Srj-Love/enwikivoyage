This is the country's biggest and busiest summer sea resort, attracting more than 4 million visitors annually with its amazing mountainous coastline, endless shingle beaches, warm sunny days, and bustling nightlife. From May to September Sochi's population at least doubles with tourists, including celebrities and political elite of the country.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:View on Sotsji from black sea.jpg"],["thumb"],["350 px"],["View on Sochi from the Black Sea"]]},"\nStrangely, only 3 percent of this visitors' crowd are international travellers, and even the frontier location of the city doesn't help to change the situation. Maybe the most famous non-politician foreign visitor of Sochi was Bono, who was invited to spend some time at President Medvedev's residence in 2010. But in general the city remains a very domestic destination, somewhat lacking in appropriate international infrastructure and having the same language barrier most regional centers of Russia do.\n\nAnother paradox of Sochi is that the city, always associated in national mentality with south, palms and hot climate, won the 2014 Winter Olympic bid. This phenomenon will be probably never understood by Russians completely: every place in the country has a real winter, but Sochi? The answers are absence of harsh frost and the very promising Alpine resort of Krasnaya Polyana in the city area. A less pragmatic explanation is the lucky destiny of Sochi. The most famous Russian saying about the city is ",{"type":"''","value":["\"If I could read the cards, I would live in Sochi\""]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["\"Знал бы прикуп - жил бы в Сочи\""]},"). Initially coming from the Preference card game, this saying shows the association of Sochi and its inhabitants with luck, moreover, with an accidental and unpredictable fortune.\n\nWell, perhaps such an Olympic luck will help the city to reach beyond the national borders and to become a truly global site. Sochi has many attractions to offer for anyone who loves nature, sports, history, and sunny beach leisure. This Black Sea Pearl is still waiting to be discovered.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nThe territory of today's Sochi was inhabited for thousands of years, populated by Caucasian mountainous tribes and being under the influence and dominion of ancient Greek, Roman, Byzantine, Abkhazian and Ottoman civilizations. A few landmarks of antecedent civilizations remained, including the Bronze Age table-stones and medieval Byzantine temples.\n\nThe Russian Empire approached these lands in the beginning of 19th century, and after a war with the Ottoman Empire acquired them in 1829. Soon after that, in 1838, Russian authorities established the fort of Alexandria, at the site of modern Central Sochi, and 2 more forts in the modern Lazarevskoe district of the city. Alexandria was renamed several times and finally obtained the name Sochi (by the name of a local river) in 1896.\n\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, Sochi became known as a resort place. In 1902 the first bath building in Matsesta was constructed and in 1909 the official resort named \"Caucasian Riviera\" was open. Right before the 1917 revolution Sochi got its city status, and in the same time the railroad connected it with the rest of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russia"]]},". But the regular train service started only 6 years later, after the Russian Civil War finished with the Bolsheviks' victory. The city was growing quite slowly (from 13,000 in 1916 to 17,000 in 1932).\n\nThe situation changed in 1934, when a general reconstruction of Sochi was initiated by Stalin's government. For just 7 years from 1932 to 1939 the city's population skyrocketed from 17,000 to 72,000. New roads, theaters, parks, hotels and spa resorts were constructed, making the look of Sochi closer to what can be seen today.\n\nIn 1961 authorities decided to incorporate neighboring settlements into Sochi, giving the start to the history of Greater Sochi (Большой Сочи).\n\nAfter the Soviet Union collapsed, Sochi took the role of Russian President's traditional summer residence from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Crimea"]]},", as that became a part of the independent ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ukraine"]]},".\n\nIn 2007 the city opened a new chapter in its history by winning the bid of the Olympic host city of 2014. The volume of construction work is huge, including new infrastructure (roads, sanitation, air and seaports, etc.), sport venues (both indoor and outdoor), commercial and residential buildings. The new look of Sochi has already started to transform the features of once a Soviet domestic resort.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh =   9.3"],["febhigh =   9.8"],["marhigh =   12.1"],["aprhigh =   16.8"],["mayhigh =   20.5"],["junhigh =   24.4"],["julhigh =   27"],["aughigh =   27.1"],["sephigh =   24.2"],["octhigh =   20"],["novhigh =   15.1"],["dechigh =   11.4"],["janlow =   3.1"],["feblow =   3.2"],["marlow =   5"],["aprlow =   9.1"],["maylow =   12.6"],["junlow =   16.4"],["jullow =   19.4"],["auglow =   19.3"],["seplow =   15.8"],["octlow =   12"],["novlow =   7.9"],["declow =   5.1"],["janprecip =  179"],["febprecip =  118"],["marprecip =  109"],["aprprecip =  116"],["mayprecip =  93"],["junprecip =  91"],["julprecip =  122"],["augprecip =  135"],["sepprecip =  135"],["octprecip =  158"],["novprecip =  191"],["decprecip =  197"],["jansun =  9:20"],["febsun =  10:30"],["marsun =  11:55"],["aprsun =  13:25"],["maysun =  14:45"],["junsun =  15:26"],["julsun =  15:05"],["augsun =  13:55"],["sepsun =  12:30"],["octsun =  11:00"],["novsun =  9:40"],["decsun =  8:56"],["description = Average of Sochi (coastal part)"]]},"\n\nSochi belongs to that tiny part of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russia"]]},", which is happily located in the subtropical climatic zone.

This makes nearly all the year months comfortable for visiting Sochi, except maybe November, December and January.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Sochi winter.JPG"],["thumb"],["350 px"],["Palms and snow: the winter in Sochi"]]},"\n\nMost of precipitation falls during the ",{"type":"'''","value":["winter"]},", partly in snow, but there is usually no regular snow cover in the coastal part of the city. Sochians rarely use winter tyres, so every heavy snowfall comes unpredictably for drivers. The climate of the mountainous part of Greater Sochi is significantly colder, allowing for a full ski season in winter (usually, February and March). Thanks to that, Krasnaya Polyana is quickly developing as a winter resort and hosted all outdoor competitions during the 2014 Winter Olympics.\n\nThe period of ",{"type":"'''","value":["spring"]}," is quite short and is characterized by gardens blossoming (usually starts in March, even if temperatures are lower than in February). This is a comfortable season with less rain, but still with the cold sea.\n\nSochi ",{"type":"'''","value":["summer"]}," can be associated with the swimming season, which usually lasts from the mid-end of May till the end of October. This is the true high season with its touristic peak in July–August. In September and October the city attracts fewer visitors, partly because of the start of the school year. These two months, when the Black Sea is still warm, air is not very hot, and streets are not filled with tourists' crowds, seem to be the most enjoying time to visit Sochi. This period is called smoothy season (\"бархатный сезон\").\n\nThe off-season ",{"type":"'''","value":["autumn"]},", coming to Sochi in the end of October, is warm, but with more cloudy days and rain. By the end of November daily average temperature drops below 10 degrees C.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Ethnicities and religions"]},"\n\nSochi is one of the most multinational cities in Russia with people of more than 100 ethnic groups living there. Most of them are ethnic Russians (68%), the important minorities are Armenians, Ukrainians, Georgians, Greeks, Circassians, Belorussians, Tatars, and Jews.\n\nRussian is the predominant language spoken by almost everyone in the city, including nearly all minorities, but many local placenames came from Abkhazian and Circassian languages.

There are also Muslims (5%), Catholics and Jews. Orthodox cathedrals are represented in all the parts of the city. The only Catholic cathedral located in Central Sochi was built in 1997 (most churchgoers are Catholic Armenians). There is also a mosque, albeit a very small and remote one (in Tkhagapsh community, 15 km towards the mountains from Lazarevskoe). The city authorities are planning to build a new mosque and a synagogue by 2014.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Greater Sochi map.png"],["thumb"],["500 px"],["Greater Sochi map"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Orientation"]},"\n\nGreater Sochi occupies 105 km along the Black Sea coastline.

Central Sochi District is the core of the city and its most developed and populated part. Many of the city attractions, hotels and most shopping centers are located there. During the summer season, Central Sochi is usually overcrowded and traffic-jammed. Lazarevskoye District is the largest (1744 km",{"type":"<","value":["sup",["2"]]},") and the longest (65 km coastline) one among Sochi districts, includes 34 sub-districts, most of them are spread along the sea shore. Lazarevskoe district is less urbanized that other ones in Greater Sochi. In fact it has many various settlements, often poorly connected with each other and lacking basic infrastructure. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Khosta"]]}," District is located to the south-east from Central Sochi, this district contains some major attractions, such as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Akhun mountain"]},".

The approximate exchange rate is 40 RUR for 1 euro or 28 RUR for 1 US dollar (as of 2011).\n\nSochi has many ATMs, especially in Central Sochi and Adler. You may withdraw not only roubles, but also dollars or euro at some of them (approximately 10% of all ATMs). Take into account, that Visa and MasterCard are widespread in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russia"]]},", but American Express cards are usually not accepted even at major tourist places.
