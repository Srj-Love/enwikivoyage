The church has frescoes, acclaimed by specialists as “the best examples of eastern medieval art during its twelve century history”.\n\nThe decline of Sofia during the Turkish Ottoman Empire was followed by the rejuvenation after the Russian liberation in 1878, when Sofia was chosen as the capital of Bulgaria at the First National Constituent Assembly, and followed by a brisk and straightforward period of construction.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.sofia-airport.bg\/ Sofia Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["SOF"]]},") is the busiest airport in Bulgaria and it was built around 1930.

These tickets can be purchased from the people wearing bright green jackets, hanging around the parking lots. The tickets should be clearly marked with pen and placed on the dashboard so they are clearly visible. The price is 1 lev for 1 hour. The easier and more convenient way however is to SMS the vehicle registration number to \"1302\" - same for all mobile operators. It will charge your bill with 1 lev. Five minutes before the prepaid time is up you will receive a warning sms. You can either send another message for another hour or move your car.\n\nPay attention to this traffic rule: \"If a tram, bus or trolley stops and is on your left side of your car you must stop in your lane and behind it, ie. public transportation vehicle should be on your left side and in front of your car.\" It is because tram rails are in the middle of the road and tram station is on the pavement so passengers of a tram will disembark to the road. Even buses have bus stops in the middle of a road.

Parking in the center is difficult; although you can find free spaces, the Bulgarian police tends to behave harshly towards foreign license plates. Even though the other cars appear to be parked legitimately, double check that there are no signs or pavement markings prohibiting it. If you drive out of the city (or enter the country by road) you must have a vignette (винетка) on every high-way. Buy it right away at the border (even though no one will tell you to and there may not be signs) or before leaving Sofia(rental car) from any fuel station. The price (2011) is 10 leva for one week - this is the shortest period available, also one-month and one-year vignettes are available. You must place it on the front window, in the bottom right corner. The fine, if you forget the vignette, is about 200 leva.\n\nCar lights are also compulsory in the light part of the day all year long.\nPedestrians should be careful since Bulgarian drivers do not yield right of way to those on foot.\n\nGenerally at night, you should avoid the area around the Bus and Train Station, Maria Luiza Blvd, the Parks (around the Palace of Culture and Borisova) and the Lions' Bridge (Lavov Most). This is especially true for single women and girls. Junkies get high there, prostitutes (both female and transsexual) offer their \"services\", some people might want to tempt you with touts of contraband (stolen, illegal, etc.) and\/or then try to mug you. These areas are also frequented with the homeless and the drunk. If your hotel is in the area you'll be alright, just don't hang around it unnecessarily. Try to act like you are familiar with the area (and farmiliarize yourself during the day) and look like a local. As long as you avoid the poorly lit areas, the centre is okay, stick to the well-lit areas such as Vitoshka, the Largo, the Sheraton hotel, the Ivan Vazov theater and Voenniya Klub (Military Club). It is wise to choose a hotel\/hostel in a better location, such as the ones listed above.\n\nDo not get into conflict with locals especially if they seem aggressive or drunk. Avoid football fan groups, they tend to be drunk and aggressive. Avoid wearing football shirts or scarves of the Sofia-based football teams, especially on match days.\n\nOn top of it all there are strong allegations of deep-rooted corruption in the Bulgarian justice system. Foreigners may find themselves in serious difficulty if they get into any legal trouble.\n\nThere are many other  reports of violence on foreigners in Sofia, although all of them were 'aggravated' cases such as a person trying to illegally buy documents or drugs.\n\nBe careful with taxis, make sure you check the prices first before you get in (the fare is per kilometer and it should be something like 0.79 during the day and 0.90 during the night, avoid cabs that display their fare as above 1.00), also make sure the cab has the driver's card on the front with his name.\n\nAlso, be wary of money exchange shops. Some of them exchange money for generally lower rates than displayed on the exchange rate panel. Go to banks, otherwise you can easily become a victim and if you want your money back the security guard might intimidate you, rough you up or physically abuse you. One such change shop is on Maria Luiza as you walk towards the Lion's bridge (Лъвов мост) just after Halite (Халите) and Ekzarh Yosif street (you'll recognise it by the misspelling of currency, spelled 'currensy').\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Embassies"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["Finland"]]},"  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Finland"],["url=http:\/\/www.finland.bg"],["email=sanomat.sof@formin.fi"],["address=26-28, Bacho Kiro 5th fl 1000  Sofia"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+359-2-810 2110"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Mo-Th 8:15AM-4:15PM, Fr 8:15AM-3PM"],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\nSofia has a large number of mostly free wireless hotspots in bars, restaurants, and cafés.
