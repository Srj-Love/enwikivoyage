Nowadays, Sohar has a new port under construction, being built at a cost of RO120million. The city is renowned for its copper deposits, and archaeological evidence points to copper extraction being carried out 5000 years ago. There are still three copper mines in operation in Sohar with over 18 million tonnes of copper deposits. \n\nThis is an attractive region for tourists due to its clean, safe beaches and the plethora of archaeological features. Visitors will be attracted to its large souq with handy tailors, fruit sellers and fishermen vying for space, and its fort which stands apart with its four-story walls and six towers, an imposing sight overlooking the bay. \n\nOne of the first references to 'Sohar' is in the work of historian, Yaqut al Hamawi who implies that the city took its name in the 6th century AH from a descendant of Noah: Sohar bin Adam bin Sam bin Noah. When the Palestinian Arab scholar Muqadisi visited the city in 10th century AH he described it as a \"flourishing city with a large number of people living there. It is a beautiful city with a comfortable life, …and its mosque overlooks the sea…the Mihrab (indicator of the direction for prayers) changes colour because it is covered in copper…\".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Mapframe"],["24.38134"],["56.71726"],["zoom=13"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Oman National Transport Company"],["alt=ONTC"],["url=http:\/\/www.ontcoman.com\/"],["email=info@ontcoman.com"],["address=Gail Al Shabool"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=near Penguin Restaurant"],["phone=+968 26 841772"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Runs four daily buses to\/from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Muscat"]]}," (3 hrs) and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Buraimi"]]},"."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Sohar Fort and Museum"],["alt="],["url="],["email="],["address=Sultan Qaboos Rd"],["lat=24.362278"],["long=56.749269"],["directions="],["phone=+968 26 844758"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Currently closed for renovation"],["price="],["content=One of the most prominent features in the city of Sohar and was built between the 13th and 14th centuries CE by the 'Emirs of Hormuz'.
