It consists of a 345 km long stretch of mountainous highlands in the Bukit Barisan, parallel to the west coast of Sumatra. The landscape is one of the most spectacular of the island and is dominated by vulcano tops, among which the Kerinci (3800 m.), the highest mountain in western Indonesia. In Kerinci-Seblat you will find most of the larger animal species, among them the Sumatran rhino, tigers, elephants, Malaysian bears and tapirs. The local population tell each other stories about short hairy people, known as the Orang Pendek.\n\nStrikingly beautiful is the top of Gunung Tujun, which is scattered with lakes, north east of Sungaipenuh. However, Lake Kerinci is easily accessible by public transport. These lakes with their surrounding woods are spots to enjoy the rich avifauna of the park, consisting of hornbills, turquoise beaks, grey wagtails and drongos.\n\nThere is proof that the woods around Kerinci were already inhabited 7500 years ago, both as hunting area and to grow crops. In the neighbourhood of Lake Kerinci kettle drums were found from the bronze and iron ages. Till today you can find old cultures with the Kubus, hunters and collectors, who a.o. inhabit the wooded areas of Kerinci-Seblat. \n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["West Sumatra"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["no Wikipedia link"]]}]
