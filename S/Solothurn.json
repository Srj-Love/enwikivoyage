In honour of their martyrdom and the associated miracles, both were declared city saints. St. Ursen Cathedral dominates the city skyline and is its emblem.\n\nSolothurn's history dates back to Roman times. As early as 350 BC the Romans built their \"Castrum Salodurum\", a bell-shaped walled fort. The remains can still be seen at Friedhofplatz and in Löwengasse.\n\nSolothurn is a German speaking town but communication in French and English is possible in the city center.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get there"]},"\n\nSolothurn is served by one of the most efficient passenger rail services in the world, the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.rail.ch Swiss Federal Rail (SBB)"]}," system.
