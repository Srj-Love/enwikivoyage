The castle there was demolished under terms of a treaty. By way of compensation Soltau was given town rights; however, by 1511 the whole town was completely destroyed by a fire.\n\nThe town hall was moved in 1533 and established in an old chapel in Marktstrasse. However, by 1567, another fire wiped out the majority of buildings within the town. Much of Soltau was destroyed over the years, especially in the Thirty Years' War, after which all that was left was ruined landscape.\n\nBy 1914 Soltau held the largest prisoner of war camp in Germany during the First World War. This was the same year that the mining of potassium salts began at Heinrichssegen Shaft, but work was then halted due to the war after having reached a depth of just 6 meters.\n\nAgain by April 1945 much of Soltau was destroyed by air raids in which many civilians were killed. Soltau become a British Garrison in 1949 during the Cold War and was home of Headquarters 7th Armoured Brigade. This was handed back in 1993 and is now used for doctors' surgeries and a business centre.\n\nSituated in the heart of the Lüneburg Heath, Soltau is an officially recognized health resort.
