[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Somerville"]}," is a city near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boston"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nSomerville has managed to hold onto its blue-collar roots while at the same time gentrifying.  It's fairly ethnically diverse, with populations including Irish, Italians, Portuguese, Brazilians (probably the largest ethnic minority), Haitians, Tibetans, Indians, Chinese, and others. It is still the most densely populated city in New England (about 80,000 people in four square miles), so visitors will find lots of purely residential territory between the \"fun\" areas: Davis Square, Porter Square, Union Square, and Powderhouse Square (the location of Tufts University).  Other notable neighborhoods include Union Square and Winter Hill, erstwhile home of the \"Winter Hill Gang\", the organized crime group headed by Whitey Bulger in the 1960s and 1970s, as well as East Somerville, probably the last non-gentrified area, which has a substantial immigrant population. \n\nSomerville has a number of \"squares\", which are areas where several of the larger roads come together and which have various stores and parking.  Navigating Somerville is easier if you consider the major squares as \"hubs\" connected by main streets as \"spokes.\"  The major squares include Davis Square, Teele Square, Powderhouse Square, Union Square, Magoun Square, and Ball Square. Many intersections have small plaques dedicating them as squares named after notable Somerville residents, frequently war veterans, but these areas are never actually referred to by those names.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Neighborhoods"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Winter Hill"]},", Located roughly north of Highland Avenue and west of the McGrath Highway, Winter Hill is home to a mix of restored homes and aluminium-sided fixer-uppers, replete with china gnomes and bathtub Virgin Marys. Once known as the home base of Irish gangsters Whitey Bulger, James \"Buddy\" McLean, Howie Winter and the notorious Winter Hill Gang, Winter Hill is now, like much of the rest of Somerville, experiencing gentrification and a resulting rise in property values and rents. Despite these changes, the area continues to hang onto its neighborhood flavor and is home to a large community of Irish, Italians, Brazilians, Portuguese, Cape Verdeans, and other ethnic groups.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Davis Square"]},", This is a great late-night summer hangout, especially given that ",{"type":"'''","value":["J.P. Licks"]}," is here.  (J.P. Licks is a trendy local ice cream shop, also seen on Newbury Street in Boston.)  It's right on the Red Line, and also a major bus transfer point.  Tons of college folk linger in the brick plaza.  The Somerville Theatre doubles as a movie house (showing first- and second-run films, as well as arthouse fare) and music venue.  The basement level of the Somerville Theatre also houses the \"Museum of Bad Art,\" (MoBA), a small and profoundly eclectic collection that never fails to astonish.  Davis Square has several coffeehouses, most notably the locally owned Diesel Cafe on Elm Street, that draw people day and night. \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Teele Square"]},", Just up the street from Davis Square (heading west) it has a lot to offer in way of local restaurants.  It's less crowded than Davis Square and less trendy.  Head up this way if you're looking for good subs and pizza (Angelina's), Mexican food (Rudy's), or multi-ethnic Mediterranean fare from the Balkans and beyond (Sabur).\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Union Square"]},", It is not on the Red Line, so it's a bit off the beaten path.  It is only a 15 minute walk from the Sullivan Square Orange Line station, and there are MBTA ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.mbta.com"]}," buses arriving from Central, Harvard, Porter, Davis, Lechmere, and Sullivan Square T stops.  (It's a nice walk in good weather from the West, but the neighborhoods to the East are less nice.)  There are a number of Brazilian restaurants and stores around, including a Brazilian butcher-slash-convenience store.  The Brazilian community extends to Inman Square (Cambridge) and there's another pocket in Allston.  There's also Indian, Mexican, and Peruvian fare here.  The Sherman Cafe and Bloc 11 cafe are two excellent locally-owned coffee houses.  Sherman Market sells local produce.  Union Square is a nice, brick-based New England intersection of many roads.  Ongoing improvements to the square include benches created by local artists.  As of mid-2010, major reconstruction of Somerville Avenue (as it travels from Porter Square to Union Square) is nearing completion, bringing with it an improved streetscape with better lighting, more traffic lights, and raised pedestrian crosswalks.  The Brickbottom Artists Studios are just outside of Union Square, under the McGrath Highway.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nFly in to Logan International Airport in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boston"]]},". A taxi from Logan to Somerville can cost anywhere between $20 and $35 depending on the location in Somerville, the route taken, and time of day.\n\nOne of the two subway stops in Somerville is the Davis Square stop on the Red Line. To reach Davis with mass transit, take the Silver Line bus service to South Station, then transfer to the Red Line.  The silver line is free and the trip to Davis should take 45 minutes to an hour. The second stop is Sullivan Square Orange Line stop. To reach Sullivan Square, one can either change from the Red Line at Downtown Crossing to the Orange Line or take the Blue Line from the airport and change to the Orange Line at State Street.\n\nOther places in Somerville can be reached on buses from Lechmere which is on the Green Line.
