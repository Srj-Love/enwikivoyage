Snow sports section of the 6th Asian Winter Games was held here. Ski lifts are good by Chinese standards and operate from 8:30AM-4PM daily, although the gondola tends to close around 3PM. Snowmaking machines are used when there is not enough natural snow (which is almost always), and then groomed. There is a trail map at the bottom of the lifts, but not at the top or anywhere else. Lift tickets cost ¥240 for a half-day pass (4 hours) and ¥320 for a full-day, which includes equipment rental. The equipment for rent are of good standard."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Songhua Lake"]}," - 550-square-km of lake se of Jilin City which looks exceptionally attractive in winter with rimmed trees"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Songhua Hu Ski Area"]}," - 25km se of Jilin City, offers beginner and intermediate skiing as well as cross-country skiing"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Lodging"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Camping"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Backcountry"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Jilin"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinepark"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["no Wikipedia link"]]}]
