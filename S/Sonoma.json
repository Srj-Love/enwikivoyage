Spanish colonial settlers first established one of their northernmost missions in 1823 when the Mission San Francisco Solano was founded by a Spanish priest, Father Joseph Altimira. The Mission was the first, last, and only California mission established under newly-independent Mexican rule. For a brief period in 1846 it was the capital of the short-lived California Republic. Today, Sonoma, with a little over 10,000 people, attracts thousands of visitors each year as a jumping point to the vineyards that surround the town.\n\nSonoma is a town consisting of wealthy retirees and wine industry celebrities, Latin American and Nepalese immigrants (yes, Sonoma has one of the largest populations of Nepalese people outside of Nepal!), and tourists. It has a more laid back vibe than it's big boasting neighbour Napa, and offers wine country cuisine, lifestyle and experience at a slightly more affordable and less Hollywood style environment.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nThere are no major highways that go through or even close to Sonoma since it is surrounded by hills on every side. The best way to get in is from California State Route 12 which goes directly through the town.
