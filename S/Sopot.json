It has been a property of the Order of Cistercians of Oliwa since 1283 until 1772, when it became annexed by Prussia.\n\nIt was not until 19th century, however, that Sopot took its present form. In 1808, a French physician named ",{"type":"'''","value":["Jean Georg Haffner"]}," came to Sopot with Napoleon's retreating army and decided to settle there, marrying a local. He immediately recognized the resort potential in the local area, and started to organize appropriate facilities first in Gdańsk and later in the centre of modern-day Sopot, constructing the first pier and the Resort House, as well as creating the park that surrounds today's pierhead. Haffner is recognized as the father of modern-day Sopot and celebrated throughout the city.\n\nSopot quickly became a fashionable spa on a European scale, accessible by the seaport of Gdańsk and the railway line to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Warsaw"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Koszalin"]]},", built in 1870. It was granted city rights in 1901 by the German Emperor, and was at the forefront of adopting modern leisure facilities, not only of the spa kind, but also including a horseracing track, tennis courts and a casino. When the iconic Grand Hotel was completed in 1927, along with the final pier extension, Sopot gained its complete form it was to retain until the new millennium, in the meantime becoming a part of Poland again. In the 2000s, much effort was put into restoring Sopot's heritage, including the reconstruction of the Resort House, conservation of the pier and a major restoration effort at the Grand Hotel.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By plane "]},"\nThe TriCity's passenger airport is the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gdańsk#By_plane"],["Lech Walesa Airport"]]}," in Gdańsk, offering a wide range of direct flights and connections, including intercontinental hubs.\n",{"type":"===","value":[" By rail "]},"\nBasically all the long-distance trains calling to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gdańsk"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gdynia"]]}," stop at ",{"type":"''","value":["Sopot Główny"]},", the only railway station in Sopot, right in the middle of the city.
