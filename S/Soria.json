This glacial lake was formed during the last ice age; its impressive 80m (260fft) high granite walls cast a black shade over the waters below.  Make sure you allow enough time to soak up the magic of this area, a favourite and inspirational place for the Spanish poet Antonio Machado.   This peaceful place can also be accessed from the GR86, one of the walking tracks that criss cross the province.  If you have a passion for mountains, with suitable equipment a hike from here of about 2 hours will bring you to the birthplace of the mighty Douro River which ends its course on the Portuguese coast.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Laguna Negra"],["alt=Glacial Lake"],["url="],["email="],["address=18kms from Vineusa (signposted)"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=The Lake can be visited all year round.
