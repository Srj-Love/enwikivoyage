The northwest of the region is mostly rural, with agriculture playing a major role. This part of the region has several getaway resorts, mostly in charming small cities like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Avaré"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Barra Bonita"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Águas de Santa Bárbara"]]},".\n\nFinally the south of the region, close to the border with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Paraná"]]},", is less densely populated and economically developed. The characteristic landscape of the region is the Itararé Valley, a geological formation containing canyons, forest and waterfalls. It is an area with formidable potential for ecotourism, although proper tourist infrastructure is still under development.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Rio Tietê - Cidade de Salto 1.jpg"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Tietê waterfall in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Salto"]]},"."]]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Through not next the sea, the region has some popular freshwater beaches, like in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Avaré"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Igaraçu do Tietê"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" The ",{"type":"'''","value":["Pirituba Canyon"]}," in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Itapeva"]]},", with sandstone walls up to 120 meters high"]},{"type":"*","value":[" The Tietê waterfall and the surrounding cultural complex (",{"type":"'''","value":["Complexo Turístico Cachoeira"]},") in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Salto"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" The churches and museums of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Itu"]]},", that will give you several insights on Brazilian history"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Itineraries"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Cycle through the whole city of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sorocaba"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" Do the dam-crossing boat ride in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Barra Bonita"]]},"; afterwards have a beer or shop for handcrafts in the riverside street"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Enjoy the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Festa do Divino Espírito Santo"]}," or the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Festa de São Benedito"]},", two traditional caipira festivals, in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tietê"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nThe Sorocabana region has relatively low crimes rates for Brazilian standards, even in the largest city, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sorocaba"]]},".
