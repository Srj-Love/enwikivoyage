Upset with a growing sentiment against slavery, ten to thirteen slave-holding states seceded after the election of President Abraham Lincoln, forming the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Confederate States of America"]},".  Three border states even fought civil wars of their own; they each had two organizations, one Unionist and one Confederate, both claiming to be the state government. What ensued was a bloody five-year conflict that left the country bruised and battered but ultimately resulted in the preservation of the nation as a single unit, and the abolition of slavery.  Most of the major battles occurred on Southern soil, and the South was devastated as a result of the war.\n\nThe South existed for over two hundred years before the Civil War. It was first settled at Roanoke Island in 1585, and the first permanent settlement was at Jamestown in 1607.  Many of the early settlers in the South were indentured servants, and later slaves.  Many Revolutionary War battles were fought in the South, including the Battle of Yorktown which effectively ended the war.  By 1800, the Southern economy focused on the growing of tobacco (in Virginia, Tennessee and the Carolinas) and cotton (elsewhere) as \"cash crops\", and did not industrialize in the early 19th century as the North did.  At the time of the Civil War, one in three Southerners was a slave.  Most of the others were farmers who were poor and owned no slaves, but a few owned large amounts of land and many slaves.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Texas"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Florida"]]}," also seceded from the union but are considered distinct regions today. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kentucky"]]}," is considered part of the south despite never seceding from the union, but allowed slavery. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["West Virginia"]]}," was formed from 50 counties of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Virginia"]]}," which repealed that state’s secession act and was admitted to the union in 1863. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Maryland"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Delaware"]]}," also allowed slavery but did not secede, and are today considered part of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mid-Atlantic"]]}," travel region, while ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Missouri"]]},", another slave state that did not secede, is covered as part of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Midwest (United States of America)"],["Midwest"]]},".\n\nAfter the Civil War, people in the South struggled to cope with defeat.  Although Southern blacks were \"free\", they remained second-class citizens.  They were often denied the vote, and many were forced to work the land as sharecroppers.  Segregation laws (called \"Jim Crow\") were rampant in the South.  Many white Southerners fought against desegregation and equality for blacks until well into the 20th century.  Some of them formed a group called the Ku Klux Klan, which terrorized blacks and immigrants.\n\nWhile the intervening 150 years have done much to heal the wounds, the Civil War is still considered a defining moment in the South.  Reenactments of battles are carried out all over the region and period reenactment is a very popular hobby.  While Confederate battle flags (rebel flags) can be found in many settings in the South, visitors should understand that, outside of a historical setting, the flag is viewed by many as a symbol of hate and\/or treason. Other than ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mississippi"]]},", all of the southern states have removed the battle flag from their heraldry.  \n\nIndeed, the South is much more a cultural region than a geographical one; states west of Texas are not considered part of \"The South\", no matter how far south they are.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nOne of the most important identifiers of the cultural South is the dialect with which its people speak. Southerners from the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Maryland's Eastern Shore"]]}," to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Northern Florida"]]},", and as far west as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Texas"]]}," speak with a very distinct accent that is different from the rest of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United States"]]},".  The accent is typically described as having a \"drawl\" or \"twang\". \n\nVisitors might note that there is some sub-regional variation in the Southern accent and dialect. In general, the local accent\/dialect changes as one passes through geographical regions (i.e., mountain dwellers speak a different dialect from those on the coast). Also, generally speaking, accents tend to be much heavier in rural areas.  While Americans tend to speak about a single \"Southern\" dialect, there are actually a variety of dialects. Visitors (especially non-native English speakers) might have trouble understanding heavier accents or local terminology. \n\nThe pronoun ",{"type":"''","value":["\"y'all\""]}," (a contraction of \"you all\") is a well-known identifier of the Southern dialect.  Though often ridiculed in popular culture, it is quite useful in ordinary speech: it represents the second-person plural (equivalent to \"vosotros\" in Spanish, \"vous\" in French, or \"ihr\" in German). It is used frequently in casual conversation, but is usually excluded from formal speech.  Though you might hear the word frequently, it is best to be careful if you attempt using it when visiting as you may appear mildly condescending toward the locals.  \n\nIt is generally considered very rude to joke about the dialect unless you are from the area.  There is a perception among people from the area that people from other regions look down on them as unintelligent and the southern drawl is sometimes held symbolic of this.  In general, they are very proud of their accent and appreciate when it is spoken of positively.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nThe biggest airport in the South by far is also the world's biggest: ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport"]]}]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["ATL"]]},".  \n\nOther major airports include ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Charlotte"]]},"\/Douglas International, both Reagan National and Dulles International in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Virginia"]]}," just outside ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Washington, D.C."]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Memphis"]]}," International, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Raleigh"]]},"-Durham International, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nashville"]]}," International, and Louis Armstrong ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Orleans"]]}," International.\n\nMost other Southern airports have flights to and from Atlanta, and many also have flights from Dallas, Houston, Miami or Washington.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nThe coast is served well by the East Coast superhighway: ",{"type":"'''","value":["I-95"]},", which cuts through Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia on its route between the megalopolis BosWash in the northeast and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Florida"]]}," to the south.

The South is also connected to other regions via the U.S. Federal Highway System and state routes.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nThere are several affordable Chinatown buses that travel from New York to farther south along the Atlantic coast, as far as the Carolinas. Greyhound from New York down the North Atlantic is relatively affordable, and a well traveled route. Traveling to and from Appalachia is less common, and Greyhound has a monopoly on bus routes to these areas. Greyhound routes to the less populous states can be quite expensive because Greyhound's operational costs per passenger for the area are higher because of the low volume of travel, and because Greyhound exploits its position as a monopoly. Most travel in the area occurs within the same general vertical corridor, rather than horizontally, and bus is no exception, so you will have to deal with several transfers. To enter Kentucky for example, a Greyhound will go from New York to Philadelphia, PA to Pittsburgh, PA to Columbus, OH to Cincinnati, OH and then downward from there. The same route will be followed if you are traveling to, say, Tennessee.\n\nGreyhound buses are cheapest if booked months in advance. A single ticket booked a month in advance from New York to Memphis may cost as much as $140. If possible to do so safely, avoid depending on Greyhound for a large quantity of consecutive trips between individual cities in the South, as traveling between cities in the South by bus is often prohibitively expensive compared to intercity bus travel on the Atlantic or Pacific. (Traveling from Lexington, KY, to Louisville, KY, only slightly more than an hour away, will usually set you back around $50)\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nHighway travel is by far the cheapest way to get around the South.  Fast-paced interstate highways cover most of the region, and connect all major cities.  Of course, there is also the option to fly from city to city; but in most cases this is considerably more expensive than driving.  Similarly, there is a limited amount of rail transit available, but this is usually quite expensive and much slower than an airplane. \n\nDo not expect to rely too heavily on public transit in most Southern cities.  With only a few exceptions, cities in this region favor auto traffic.  As a result, traveling beyond the core of a city is often difficult without an automobile. In all cases, it is best to do your homework before arriving.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nThe South abounds with historical sites, from colonial settlements, to Civil War battlefields, to Civil Rights landmarks.  Visit Historic Jamestown in Virginia to explore the site of the earliest successful British settlement in North America (1607).  Also plan to visit nearby Colonial ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Williamsburg"]]},", which presents a picturesque recreation of life in a colonial village, and includes 500 restored and reconstructed period buildings.  From there, head down the road to Yorktown, where Lord Cornwallis surrendered to Gen. George Washington in 1781, effectively ending the American Revolutionary War.  \n\nMany Southern cities from the late colonial\/early republic periods still retain much of their original charm.  Notable among these are ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Charleston (South Carolina)"],["Charleston"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Beaufort (South Carolina)"],["Beaufort"]]}," in South Carolina, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Savannah"]]}," in Georgia, and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Orleans\/French Quarter"],["New Orleans' French Quarter"]]}," in Louisiana.  Many smaller towns boast quaint Neoclassical and Victorian historic districts, and many old boulevards in the Deep South are lined with ancient oak trees draped with Spanish moss.  Antebellum plantations and famous presidential estates, such as George Washington’s Mount Vernon, Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello, and Andrew Jackson’s Hermitage, are popular attractions during the spring, summer, and fall.  The nation's second oldest institution of higher learning, The College of William and Mary (1693), can be found nestled in the heart of Virginia's historic colonial district.   Several of the USA’s oldest public universities can also be found in the South, including The University of Georgia (1785), The University of North Carolina (1789), The University of South Carolina (1801), and The University of Virginia (1819), a UNESCO World Heritage Site. \n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Malvern Cannons , Civil War Battlefield, RIchmond National Battlefield.jpg"],["A Civil War battlefield near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Richmond (Virginia)"],["Richmond, Virginia"]]}],["thumb"],["right"],["250px"]]},"\n\nThe American Civil War was the bloodiest conflict in United States history, and in many ways, still defines the South up to the present day.  Battles took place in every southern state, and many of the most notable battlefields are maintained by the National Park Service, including Manassas (Bull Run), Fredericksburg, and Appomattox in Virginia; Shiloh (Pittsburg Landing)in Tennessee; Chattanooga in Tennessee; Chickamauga in Georgia; and Vicksburg in Mississippi.  Many wartime forts are still in good condition, and are open to the public.  These include Fort Sumter near Charleston, Fort Pulaski near Savannah, and Forts Morgan and Gaines near Mobile, Ala.  \n\nMany of the most visible landmarks from the African-American Civil Rights Movement are also located in the South.  These include Little Rock Central High School in Arkansas; Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, 16th Street Baptist Church, and the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Alabama; and Ebenezer Baptist Church in Georgia.  Several interpretive centers have been set up to chronicle the struggle for equality, including the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute in Alabama, and the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site in Georgia. \n\nOther historic sites in the region include the Wright Brothers National Memorial in North Carolina, Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, and NASA’s Marshall Spaceflight Center in Alabama.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\nMany parts of the South flourish with natural beauty, and offer abundant opportunities for outdoor recreation.  The southern Appalachian Mountains stretch from Alabama to West Virginia. Hiking, camping, rafting, fishing, caving, and rock climbing are among the most popular outdoor activities in this region.  Many public recreation areas can be found here, including the country’s most visited national park, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, on the Tennessee\/North Carolina border, as well as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shenandoah National Park"]]}," in Virginia.  The Appalachian Trail stretches the length of the chain, from Georgia through West Virginia, and offers backpackers a unique view of one of America’s most diverse ecosystems. There is also The Natchez Trace Parkway, which runs from Nashville, TN to Natchez, MS. This is the old travel route that boatmen and traders took back North after bringing their trade to the ports in Natchez and New Orleans. The Natchez trace has Indian mounds and lots of historic sites along the way.\n\nFor those more inclined to enjoy the view from the road, the Blue Ridge Parkway in North Carolina and Virginia offers up stunning vistas from the comfort of your vehicle, and provides easy access to the colossal Biltmore Mansion, as well as such mountain towns as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Asheville"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Boone (North Carolina)"],["Boone"]]},", NC.  Other popular recreation areas include Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky and Hot Springs National Park in Arkansas, as well as a multitude of rivers, lakes, streams, and marshes. \n\nDuring the winter, ski resorts in North Carolina and West Virginia draw large regional crowds, usually with the help of artificial snowmaking devices.  The ski trails aren’t as steep or as high as those in the Western US, but they’re still good for a bout of weekend fun.  \n\nThe South’s coastal areas are among the most scenic in the country. Sunbathing, swimming, parasailing, and fishing are among the most popular activities here.  The most popular seaside resorts include the upscale Hilton Head Island, as well as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Myrtle Beach"]]},", in South Carolina; and Gulf Shores in Alabama.  The region also boasts many barrier island chains, preserved in their natural state, many of which are accessible by ferry.  These include Cumberland Island National Seashore in Georgia, Gulf Islands National Seashore in Mississippi, The Eastern Shore of Virginia, as well as North Carolina’s Outer Banks. \n\nMost of the USA’s greatest contributions to popular music originated in the South, and this is reflected today in vibrant music scenes in many of the larger cities. Fans of American music can visit Beale Street in Memphis, Music Row in Nashville, or Bourbon Street in New Orleans for a taste of the South’s continuing musical legacy.  \n\nFans of traditional American sports will also find plenty to do all across the region.  College football is by far the most popular sport in the South (except in Kentucky, where college basketball is more popular), and sends mammoth crowds flooding into university towns nearly every Saturday during the fall. Stock car racing is also extremely popular, and NASCAR events draw large crowds to tracks for much of the year. College basketball also enjoys a significant following, but in most areas is less popular than college football (with Kentucky and, to a lesser extent, North Carolina as exceptions). The Kentucky Derby, held at Churchill Downs in Louisville, is an iconic American event, and brings in spectators from all over the world. NFL football, Major League Baseball, NBA basketball, and NHL hockey games are popular events to attend in the largest cities.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\nThe South is well known for its wide variety of regional cuisine. At the core of the diet is \"standard\" Southern food -- often known as \"soul food\" in other regions of the country.  This typically includes local signatures such as collard greens, sweet potatoes (called yams), black-eyed peas, okra, watermelon, and corn bread.  ",{"type":"'''","value":["Grits"]},", a corn meal or hominy paste, is a popular breakfast side.  Note:  grits are intended to be served with seasonings, especially salt, pepper, and butter.  Plain grits are virtually tasteless, so ordering them that way will not give you a good impression and further draw attention to the fact that you are an outsider.\n\nDue to its cultural diversity (especially at the coasts), the South is home to a number of unique culinary traditions.  Perhaps the most famous is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cajun food"]},", a zesty diet found in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Acadiana"]]}," region of Louisiana.  The ",{"type":"'''","value":["crawfish"]},", a shrimp-like shellfish, is a hallmark of this style of cooking. You may also encounter ",{"type":"'''","value":["Low-country"]}," cuisine, which hails from the coastal area of South Carolina and focuses on seafood, particularly shrimp, crab, fish, and oysters. A more recent addition to the Southern palate is the advent of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Latin food"]},", especially in Florida and the region's larger cities.

Do not approach or cut through a stranger's property at night if you are in a rural area or the outskirts of a city: most people who have bought a gun have done so for protecting their family.\n\nOutside of a few big cities, it is likely that people will realize that you aren't a local. Whether you hail from Cleveland or from Uganda, some will stare in curiosity, especially in small towns and villages where visitors are rare.
