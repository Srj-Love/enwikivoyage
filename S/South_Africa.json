While you can fly into any country in southern Africa, most flights will route through South Africa anyway. South Africa is also a good place to get used to travelling in the region (though some would argue that Namibia is better for that). Of course South Africa is not only a jumping off point, it is itself a superb destination rich in culture, fauna, flora and history.\n\nOutsiders' views of South Africa are coloured by the same stereotypes as the rest of Africa. Contrary to popular belief, South Africa is not devastatingly poor with an unstable government. Although the rural part of South Africa remains among the poorest and the least developed parts of the world and poverty in the townships can be appalling, progress is being made. The process of recovering from apartheid, which lasted almost 46 years, is quite slow. In fact, South Africa's United Nations Human Development Index  which was slowly improving in the final years of apartheid, has declined dramatically since 1996, largely due to the AIDS pandemic, and poverty levels appear to be on the increase.  South Africa boasts a well-developed infrastructure and has all the modern amenities and technologies, much of it developed during the years of white minority rule. The government is stable, although corruption is common. The government and the primary political parties generally have a high level of respect for democratic institutions and human rights.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Geography"]},"\nSouth Africa is located at the southernmost tip of Africa, with a long coastline that stretches more than 2,500 km (1,553 mi) and along two oceans (the South Atlantic and the Indian).\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nThe tip of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Africa"]]}," has been home to the Khoisan (",{"type":"''","value":["collective name for Hottentot (Koi) and Bushmen (San)"]},") people for thousands of years. Their rock art can still be found in many places throughout South Africa. It is estimated that Bantu tribes may have started to slowly expand into the northernmost areas of what is today ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southern Africa"]]}," at around 2,500 years ago and by around 500 AD the different cultural groups as we know them today had been established in the lush areas to the north and east of the what is today known as Eastern South Africa, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. The desert and semi-desert areas of the Western and Northern Cape provinces, as well as the western parts of the Eastern Cape province remained unsettled by the Bantu as the arid climate, limited seasonal rainfall, sparse vegetation and scarcity of natural sources of water could not sustain large migrations of people and herds of cattle, cattle being the primary livestock reared by the Bantu and fulfilling numerous cultural and economic functions within the tribal society (cattle served as a rudimentary currency and basic unit of exchange with a mutually agreeable value between bartering parties, thus fulfilling the function of money). The \"Khoisan\" existed in these areas as nomadic hunters, unable to permanently settle as the movement of desert game in search of dwindling water supplies during winter months determined their own migration. Not until the \"Boers\" (see next paragraph) moved into these areas and established boreholes and containment ponds could any permanent settlements be established in these areas. Today, with more reliable sources of water and modern methods of water conservancy the agricultural activity remains limited mainly to sheep and ostrich ranching as these animals are better suited to the sparse feed and limited water.\n\nThe first permanent European settlement was built at Cape Town after the Dutch East India Company reached the Cape of Good Hope in April 1652. In the late 1700s, the ",{"type":"''","value":["Boers"]}," (",{"type":"''","value":["the settling farmers"]},") slowly started expanding first westward along the coastline and later upwards into the interior. By 1795, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Britain"]]}," first took control of the Cape, as a consequence of the Napoleonic wars on the Dutch, and in 1820, a large group of British settlers arrived in the region. In 1835, large numbers of ",{"type":"''","value":["Boers"]}," started out on the ",{"type":"''","value":["Groot Trek"]}," (the great migration) into the interior after becoming dissatisfied with the British rule. In the interior, they established their own internationally recognized republics.\n\nTwo wars for control over the region were fought between the ",{"type":"''","value":["Boers"]}," and the British in 1880 and 1899.  The second war occurred after British settlers flooded into the area surrounding Johannesburg known as the \"Witwatersrand\" (white water escarpment) in response to the discovery of gold in 1886. The Second Boer War (Afrikaans: ",{"type":"''","value":["Die Tweede Vryheidsoorlog"]}," or 'Second War of Independace') was particularly unpleasant, as the British administration contained the Boer civilian population in concentration camps resulting in one of the earliest recorded genocides. Boer farms, livestock, crops and homesteads were also largely destroyed.\n\nAfter peace was restored by the 1902 Treaty of Vereeniging, the ",{"type":"''","value":["Union of South Africa"]}," was formed in 1910, consolidating the various ",{"type":"''","value":["Boer"]}," republics and British colonies into a unified state as a member of the British Commonwealth.  In 1961, the Republic of South Africa was formed and SA exited the Commonwealth. Non-Europeans were largely excluded from these political changes as they had received sovereign lands in which to live under self-rule, in accordance their own tribal legal system and hierarchical form of government.\n\nIn 1948, the National Party came to power. The NP introduced numerous ",{"type":"''","value":["apartheid"]}," laws which were intended, initially, to give a national\/tribal, independent and sovereign \"homeland\" to each of the various tribes within South Africa, who were frequently engaged in raids and border wars against each other. This was a move that was initially welcomed by the majority of the different tribal kings and chieftains, as most of the tribes sought self-governance. Since then, South Africa became practically synonymous with fascism, racism, and many other pejorative descriptions. The African National Congress (ANC) was banned and forced into exile for conducting and plotting terrorist activities against civilians, other political parties that were considered 'dangerous' and 'subversive' were also banned by the South African parliament during this time as South Africa became more involved in a war against communist insurrection on the former German colony of 'South West Africa's' border with Angola. This war was conducted in accordance with the 'League of Nations' (today the 'United Nations') mandate that followed the Second World War, bestowing upon South Africa the protectorate of the confiscated former German colony 'South West Africa' (today The Republic of Namibia).\n\nThe Republic, despite experiencing rapid infrastructure development and strong economic growth until the late 1980s, also experienced frequent domestic uprisings in response to the apartheid laws. During this time the international community also installed weapons and trade embargoes against South Africa, as well as banning South Africa from the Olympic Games and most other international sporting competitions.\n\nIn the late 1980s, many white moderates began to recognize that change was inevitable, as international sanctions and internal strife were beginning to take a severe toll on South Africa.  Thus, moderates within the security service and the National Party itself began quietly reaching out to ANC leaders to negotiate how to dismantle apartheid, which started with the freeing of political prisoners in 1990.\n\nPolitical violence worsened badly during the early 1990s as extremists of all kinds attempted to derail ANC-NP peace talks in favor of their own visions of the future of South Africa. In 1992, 73% of the voting white population voted in a referendum to have the ",{"type":"''","value":["apartheid"]}," system abolished. This was quickly followed by a new constitution in 1993 and then the nation's first truly democratic election in April 1994, in which all SA adult citizens were allowed to vote regardless of their ethnic and cultural background. Former political prisoner Nelson Mandela was elected the country's first democratically elected president. The ANC won a 63% majority and proceeded to form a Government of National Unity with the NP.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Place names"]},"\nMany region, city, street and building names in South Africa have been changed after the end of apartheid and some of them are still being changed today.

without a visa if you are required to have one, as visas will not be issued at points of entry. If needed, you can extend your visa in South Africa. With an extension the total amount of time you are allowed to stay is 6 months.

A way to 'extend' your visa without going through the disaster that is the Department of Home Affairs, is by leaving and re-entering South Africa. Note that contrary to popular belief, a 30 day visa cannot be 'reset' when leaving and re-entering South Africa from the bordering countries of Lesotho, Swaziland and possibly Namibia and Botswana (though Mozambique is fine). You will NOT get a new visa. For example, when you have a 30 day visa, and exit South Africa and enter Lesotho or Swaziland after 5 days of validity and re-enter South Africa after 5 days, you are only allowed to stay another 20 days in South Africa and not 30 days. However if you fly back to Europe or go to Mozambique, and then re-enter South Africa, you will be issued a new 30 day visa.\n\nMake sure you have ",{"type":"''","value":["2 blank pages"]}," back to back in your passport and that it is valid for at least 30 days after your intended date of departure, or you will be sent back! Make sure you have a return ticket available or they will send you back.

Since 1994, South Africa has been implementing a system of road signs almost identical to Germany's system, with suitable modifications for local conditions (German, like Afrikaans, also has long place names).

They do not use their turn indicators in a safe and predictable fashion, if at all.\n\nA noticeable number of South Africans tend to ignore speed limits. They are prone to selfish or aggressive driving behavior, such as tailgating and hooting. On multi-lane roadways, the principle of keep-left, pass right, is often not adhered to. On two-lane roadways, cars often pass slower vehicles in the centre of the roadway despite oncoming traffic.

South Africans pedestrians in general tend to be rather aggressive, like pedestrians from some Southern European countries, and you must be alert for pedestrians who will step into traffic and expect you to stop or swerve for them.\n\nYou will also encounter a very large number of people walking along the freeways or running across them simply because that is the fastest route on foot to where they want to go and they cannot afford a car, taxi, or minibus to take them there. Look out for South Africa's notorious taxi and minibus drivers, who will sometimes even stop on freeways to pick up or drop off fares.\n\nWhen driving outside of the major cities, you will often encounter animals, wild and domestic, in or near the roadway. The locals tend to herd their cattle and goats near the road. If you see an animal on or by the road, slow down, as they are unpredictable. ",{"type":"'''","value":["Do not stop to feed wild animals!"]},"\n\nShould you find yourself waiting at a red traffic light late at night in an area where you do not feel safe, you could (illegally) cross over the red light after first carefully checking that there is no other traffic. If you receive a fine due to a camera on the traffic light, you can sometimes have it waived by writing a letter to the traffic department or court explaining that you crossed safely and on purpose, due to security reasons. The fact remains that, for whatever reason, you have broken the law. Do not make a habit of this.\n\nWhen stopped at a traffic light at night, always leave enough room between your car and the car in front of you so you can get around them. It is a common hijacking maneuver to box your car in. This is especially prevalent in the suburbs of Johannesburg.\n\nSo far as possible, and especially when driving in urban areas, try not to have any belongings visible inside the car - keep them out of sight in the glove boxes or in the boot (trunk). The same applies, but even more so, when parking your car. It is also considered safe practice to drive in urban areas with the car windows closed and the doors locked. These simple precautions will make things less attractive for potential thieves and criminals.\n\nAs you would do in any other country, always be alert when driving. The safest way is to drive defensively and assume that the other driver is about to do something stupid \/ dangerous \/ illegal.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Road System"]},"\nSpeed limits are usually clearly indicated. Generally, speed limits on highways are 120km\/h, those on major roads outside built-up areas are 100 km\/h, those on major roads within built-up areas are 80km\/h and those on normal city\/town roads are 60 km\/h. But beware - in some areas, the posted speed limits may change suddenly and unexpectedly.\n\nThe roads within South Africa, connecting most major cities, and between its immediate neighbors are very good. There are many national and regional roads connecting the cities and larger centres, including the N1 running from Cape Town through Johannesburg and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pretoria"]]}," up to Harare, Zimbabwe, the N2 running from Cape Town to Durban, which passes through the world-famous ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Garden Route"]]}," near ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Knysna"]]},", and the N3 between ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Durban"]]}," and Johannesburg.\n\nSome portions of the national roads are limited access, dual carriage freeways (",{"type":"''","value":["the N3 between Johannesburg and Durban is freeway almost all the way"]},") and some sections are also toll roads with emergency assist telephones every couple of kilometers. Toll roads generally have two or more lanes in each direction.\n\nThe large fuel companies have rest stops every 200-300 km along these highways where you can fill up, eat at a restaurant, buy takeaways, do some shopping or just stretch your legs. Restrooms at these facilities are well maintained and clean. Most (but not all) of these rest stops also have ATMs.\n\nSome of the main roads have only one lane in each direction, especially where they are far from urban centres. When driving on such a road, after passing a truck or other slow-moving vehicle that has moved onto the hard shoulder (often marked by a yellow line) to let you pass, it is customary to flash your hazard lights once. This is considered a ",{"type":"''","value":["thank you"]}," and you will most likely receive a ",{"type":"''","value":["my pleasure"]}," response in the form of the slow vehicle flashing its headlights once. Bear in mind that it is both illegal and dangerous to drive on the hard shoulder - although many people do.\n\nIn many rural areas, you will find unpaved \"dirt\" roads. Most of these are perfectly suitable for a normal car, although a reduced speed might often be advisable. Extra caution is required when driving on these roads, especially when encountering other traffic - windscreens and lights broken by flying stones are not uncommon.\n\nWhilst it is not yet compulsory, more and more drivers are adopting the practice of driving with their headlights on at all times. This greatly increases their visibility to other road users.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Fuel Stations"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Sasol Garage in Boksburg.jpg"],["thumb"],["A SASOL garage in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gauteng"]]}]]},"\nFuel stations are full service with lead free petrol, lead replacement petrol and diesel available. Pump attendants will offer to wash your windscreen and check oil and water in addition to just filling up the car. It is usual to tip the attendant approximately R5 - if you don't have change filling up R195, for example, and let the attendant keep the change, it is a courteous idea.

However, after a period in which fuel stations accepted only their own proprietary credit cards, in 2009, the government authorized them to begin accepting major credit cards like Visa and MasterCard. As of 2011, some smaller fuel stations accept cash only, but most fuel stations will accept major credit cards. Thus, you do not need to carry large amounts of cash to pay for fuel, unless you are absolutely certain you will need to purchase fuel in a rural area that does not yet support credit cards.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["The Law"]},"\nLaw enforcement (speed and other violations) is usually done by portable or stationary, radar or laser cameras. Local police forces, especially in rural areas, direct a lot of their efforts in to fining motorists (so to raise revenue rather than to improve road safety). If you see an oncoming car flashing his headlights at you then he or she is probably warning you of an upcoming speed camera he has just passed. Non camera portable radar and laser systems are also used and you may be pulled over for speeding (or other violations) and given a written fine. Fines can be sent to the registered address of the vehicle you are driving, but paying on-the-spot fines is also common, usually the policeman will hold your license whilst you go to the local police station to pay the fine, you get a receipt, and drive back to where you were stopped hand the receipt over to the policeman get your license back - this can take a good hour or more, which can be more of an annoyance than the R400 fine.\n\nIn general, the police are pretty honest, but they do respond to politeness and deference to their authority. You may find that when a traffic police officer stops you they will ask for some fairly ludicrous piece of paperwork (a letter from the Ministry... the cars road worthiness certificate...) and that you are in lots of trouble if you don't have it - be firm, cool and friendly and state that you understand that all you need is a drivers license etc. In general, the police want an easy life and can't be bothered to argue for ages if they think you aren't going to offer a 'tip'.\n\nSouth Africa currently does not have a merits system and does not share traffic violation information with other nations.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Licence Requirements"]},"\nIf your driver's licence is in any of South Africa's 11 official languages (",{"type":"''","value":["e.g. English"]},") and it contains a photo and your signature integrated into the licence document, then it is legally acceptable as a valid driver's licence in South Africa. However, some car rental and insurance companies may still insist that you provide an International Driver's Permit.\n\nIt is generally best practice to acquire an International Driver's Permit in your country of origin, prior to starting your journey, regardless of whether your licence is legally acceptable or not.\n\nOne individual always travels with a hired car in South Africa (at least one month per year) and never had an international drivers permit, just a Dutch driver's licence, perfectly acceptable.\n\nNote that police may ask for a bribe (between R200 to R600) if you produce a foreign driver's licence (see also Stay safe section). Don't pay it, ask for their name and ID number and report them.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nThere are scheduled bus services between Cape Town, Johannesburg, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Durban"]]}," and other cities (with stops in between), as well as connections to neighboring countries.

You can use any Cirrus or Maestro card as well as all major credit and debit cards at the ATMs.  South African bank ATMs do not charge any fees above those levied by your own financial institution.\n\nIt is best to use only ATMs that are inside a mall or other building. Always be careful to make sure no one is watching you enter your PIN, and be vigilant about scams (e.g. machines that seem to eat your card and won't give it back after you enter the PIN). Do not accept help from strangers when withdrawing money at an ATM. If you are approached and offered unwanted help, rather cancel the transaction immediately and go to a different ATM.\nThe till points at some major retail stores (",{"type":"''","value":["such as Pick 'n Pay"]},") also act as ATMs; simply tell the checkout clerk that you would like to withdraw money.\n\nVISA and MasterCard are accepted almost everywhere.  American Express and Diners Club are also accepted, but not as widely.\n\nMost retail stores accept credit cards and pin based debit cards as payment.  While South Africa has begun to move towards a chip-and-PIN credit card system like Europe, most stores are still on the traditional credit card system in which the user merely signs the receipt after the transaction is approved.  Thus credit card users from countries also still on that system (like the United States) will have no problem using their credit cards in South Africa, provided that they have notified their bank in advance of their travel plans.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["VAT"]}," (Value Added Tax) is levied at 14% on almost all products in South Africa.

The key is to know and stick to general safety precautions: never walk around in deserted areas at night or advertise possession of money or expensive accessories.\n\nDo not accept offers from friendly strangers. Do not wear a tummy bag with all your valuables; consider a concealed money belt worn under your shirt instead. Leave passports and other valuables in a safe or other secure location, although most banks and exchange bureaus require your passport in order to exchange foreign monies to Rands. Do not carry large sums of money. Do not walk by night in deserted places. Hide that you are a tourist: conceal your camera and binoculars. Do not leave your valuables in plain sight when driving in your car, as \"smash and grab\" attacks sometimes occur at intersections, and keep your car doors locked and your windows open no more than half way. Know where to go so that you avoid getting lost or needing a map: that will avoid signs.\n\nIf you are carrying bags, try to hook them under a table or chair leg when sitting down, as this will prevent them from being snatched.\n\nVisiting the townships is possible, but do not do it alone unless you really know where you're going.

It is best to ignore anyone who appears to be in distress at the side of the road as it could be part of a scam. Keep going until you see a police station and tell them about what you have seen.\n\nBeware that if you are driving in South Africa, when police officers stop you to check your licence, and you show them an overseas driver's licence, they may come out with some variant of `Have you got written permission from [random government department] to drive in our country?' If your license is written in English or you have an International Driving Permit then they can't do anything. Stand your ground and state this fact - be polite, courteous and don't pay any money (bribes).\n\nTake extra care when driving at night. Unlike in Europe and North America, vast stretches of South African roads, especially in rural areas, are poorly lit or often completely unlit. This includes highways. Be extra careful as wildlife and people often walk in the middle of the road in smaller towns (not cities like Pretoria, Johannesburg, or Cape Town).

The best thing to do is simply ignore it; leave the responsibility for enlightening lectures to other South Africans, who know the subject better than any foreign traveller as they have lived it. South Africans of different races generally treat each other politely at a personal level.
