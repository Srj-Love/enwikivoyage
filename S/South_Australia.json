It was first split off from New South Wales and proclaimed a colony in 1834, and unlike the other states in Australia was never a penal colony, instead being settled entirely by free settlers from Britain from the 1830s onwards. Following the British settlement, waves of settlers also began to come in from other parts of Europe, most notably Ireland, Germany, Italy, Greece and Poland. With nearly 1.6 million people, however, the state comprises less than 10% of the Australian population and ranks fifth in population among the states and territories. However, the state covers a vast amount of land area, including some of the most arid parts of the country. With a total land area of 983,482 square kilometres (379,725 sq mi), it is the fourth largest of Australia's six states and two territories. The state also includes Kangaroo Island, Australia's third largest island which lies off the coast of the mainland in the south-east of the state.\n\nSouth Australia is a state that has remained politically innovative and culturally vibrant throughout its history. It is known for its festivals and fine produce. While South Australia is not the tourist magnet that its northern neighbour is, South Australia offers a different perspective on Australia from many of its different parts. With world-class wine and other produce, friendly people, unspoilt environment and a very relaxed pace of life, it offers the break in Australia that you may have been looking for.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Regions"]},"\n\nSouth Australia covers a vast amount of area, from coastal towns to arid desert.

The Central Market  precinct is the location of Adelaide's small ",{"type":"''","value":["Chinatown"]}," and has many Asian food outlets and restaurants. Many cafes, restaurants and retail food outlets line the streets around the Market complex.\n\nThe official opening of the Adelaide Central Market was on 22 January 1870. The Central Market was open on Tuesdays and Saturdays with 50 to 100 produce carts. The market sold vegetables, fruit, hay, fish and game meats. On 8 February 1900 the first stone was laid to build the current Central Market façade, which still stands today. In the same year a 40 meter veranda was added.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Adelaide Central Market"],["url=http:\/\/www.adelaidecentralmarket.com.au"],["email="],["address=Between Gouger and Grote Streets, a little west of Victoria Square"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=Mon: closed, Tues: 7AM-5:30PM, Wed: 9AM-5:30PM, Thurs: 9AM-5:30PM, Fri: 7AM-9PM, Sat:7AM-3PM, Sun: closed"],["price="],["content=The Central Market has over 80 stalls and is South Australia's most visited tourist attraction."]]}]},"\nThe state produces citrus fruits such as oranges, lemons, grapefruit, stone fruits such a nectarines, peaches and plums, apples, pears, and table grapes such as sultana and muscatel.\n\nWheat, barley and oats are staple grain crops, legumes such as peas and many bean varieties are also produced. The state has an extensive market garden industry growing a wide range of vegetables in all seasons. Nuts such as almonds and walnuts are grown near Adelaide and the state has a vibrant high quality olive oil industry.\n\nSeafood is both farmed in sea-water pens, grown in onshore tanks and caught in the wild by line fishing, trolling and trawling. South Australia has a well developed tuna, scale fish, oyster, craysish (lobster) and abalone industry. The cold fresh waters of the Southern Ocean and the two gulfs has historically been bountiful but due to overfishing stringent controls have been brought to bear upon both commercial and recreational fishing. Historically, inland waterways such as the Murray river and the Coorong were also highly productive but have declined drastically due to environmental impacts and degradation.\n\nThe state also has a highly developed viticulture and wine making tradition and the industry produces many wine varieties for local, national and international markets.\n\nSouth Australia also has a good reputation for rearing beef cattle for veal and beef meats, dairy production including milks, yoghurts, fresh and matured cheeses. The state has a strong history of sheep meat production including mutton and lamb. Local game meats include kangaroo and rabbits, which are wild harvested, normally in the mid-north and far north of the state. The poultry industry is well developed and provides both battery farm, free range and 'organic' eggs, chicken, ducks and turkeys.\n\nAdelaide especially has a good reputation for restaurant and cafe dining. Other areas, including the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Clare Valley"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Barossa Valley"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kangaroo Island"]]}," have strong regional cafe and restaurant industries that exploit the high quality fresh produce available in those areas.\n\nThe ethnic culinary influences and production skills borne by many generations of immigration has helped the development of the food and produce industry in South Australia. Italian, Greek, Polish, German, Malaysian, Chinese and Vietnamese immigrants to the state have had particularly strong influence on the development of the states food culture.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Beer "]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Coopers Beer"]},", is an icon of South Australia.
