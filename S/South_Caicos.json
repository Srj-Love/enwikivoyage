Traveling between islands by boat is possible, but usually isn't practical for tourists because there are no scheduled trips and requires knowing a local person making the journey.\n\nThere is also a Dominican boat that makes regular trips between South and Puerto Plata, DR via Grand Turk.  It is possible to hitch a ride for a fee, but it's not really a passenger boat.  The journey is made about every 20 days and takes about 9 hours.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Turks and Caicos Islands"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:South Caicos"]]}]
