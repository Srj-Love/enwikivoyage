The M2, M3, M4, M20, M23 and M40 motorways all connect the region, radiating around London from the M25 peripheral road. \n\nHowever, with high population density comes a high volume of traffic, and there are often delays on the busiest parts of the network. As a rule of thumb, traffic will always be significantly busier during the 'rush hours' (commuter periods between 7AM-9AM and 4PM-7PM) than other times of the day.

Staying in Kent, Romney Marsh is known for producing a particularly delicious salty lamb. Moving west into Sussex, we find a county that has produced eight unique cheeses, among them Sussex Slipcote, Flower Marie and Lord of the Hundreds. Hampshire is not associated with any particular dishes (though its game, freshwater trout and, above all, its sausages are highly regarded) but it is known for variety and quality. \n\nAt the dessert end of the spectrum, perhaps the most famous southern dish is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Eton"]]}," Mess.

Most of these produce ",{"type":"'''","value":["English sparkling wine"]},", as the soil and climate of southern England is said to be similar to that of the Champagne regions in France. Despite its formerly shocking reputation (English wine was once considered undrinkable, even by the Englishǃ), the wine industry in southern England seems to be doing rather well of late, enjoying both growing commercial success and awards with some of the latter even championing English sparkling wine over its Gallic cousins. Unfortunately, supermarkets and restaurants still largely favour overseas wines, so it is often necessary to buy straight from the producer. But with an increasing number of wineries appearing, especially in Kent and Sussex, there's never been a better time to pay a visit to an English vineyard.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nSouth East England is generally a very safe region and there is no specific threat posed to tourists.
