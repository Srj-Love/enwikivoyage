As an introduced species they have stressed the environment, browsing and trampling local vegetation and occasionally disrupting nesting birds, including penguins.  Arguments have been made that the reindeer should be eradicated to help restore the island to a more pristine condition, but opponents have argued against a wholesale slaughter and pointed out that the species provides an interesting scientific test group since the animals have had to completely invert their natural breeding cycle to accommodate the reversed seasons of the southern hemisphere.  After many years of deliberation, the island's management plan has been updated to include extermination of the reindeer in order to protect the native wildlife and vegetation.\n\nSimilarly, rats arrived with the whalers and proceeded to decimate the island's nesting bird population.  In 2011, a multiyear program began to eradicate rats from the island.  The effort is the largest rat eradication in history, covering an area seven times larger than the previous record holder, Campbell Island in New Zealand.  Phase one was completed with no signs of rats remaining in the target area, and the hope is that once the full eradication is complete that over one hundred million seabirds will reclaim their ancestral home."]]},"\n\nAnother enormous king penguin rookery, Salisbury Plain is also home to vast numbers of penguins and seals.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Albatross Island"]},"\n\nAlbatross Island is home to limited numbers of wandering albatross, which is among the largest and most threatened birds in the world.
