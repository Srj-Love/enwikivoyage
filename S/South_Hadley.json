Staying at the Marriot Inn in Chicopee is likely a better bet, although if you are specifically visiting Mount Holyoke it is worth checking Willits-Hallowell first. \n\nIf you have a friend at Mount Holyoke who is willing to share her room with you, be aware that guests at Mount Holyoke are limited to seven consecutive days and are technically not allowed to move between floors in the dorm without a student escort. In addition, there is at least one female-only bathroom in every dorm, so male guests may need to use a bathroom on a different floor. Enforcement of these rules varies from dorm to dorm and from year to year, but as being caught could land your host in a lot of trouble, it's generally better not to risk it.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["42.258333"],["-72.575000"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Five College area"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:South_Hadley,_Massachusetts"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/North_America\/United_States\/Massachusetts\/Localities\/S\/South_Hadley\/"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:South Hadley, Massachusetts"]]}]
