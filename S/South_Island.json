It also feels older than other cities in NZ because it was built by gold rush money in the late 19th century but has since been surpassed by bigger and brasher cities to the north. Invercargill has been steadily losing population for many years but the warmth of that southern welcome will astound you. Nelson is still very young by European standards (although it was the second founded city in New Zealand) but still has its own symphony orchestra and a fine collection of Victorian stately homes.

Temperatures generally become cooler the further south you go – but you can still experience the classic New Zealand \"four seasons in one day\" in any part of this island. Coastal regions are generally milder because the sea buffers temperatures. Elevated regions in the centre of this island have a more alpine climate, being cooler in winter, hotter in summer and having less rainfall. Many of the mountains themselves are permanently capped with snow.\n\nIn winter, snowfalls are common in central, elevated regions (occasionally leading to the temporary closure of roads). During winter, snow also occasionally falls down to sea level and even coastal region temperatures can often drop below zero overnight (32°F) – although rarely by much.\n\nThe West Coast of the South Island also has its own unique weather system. Westerly air flow from the Tasman Sea rises as it hits the mountains. This results in a large amount of rain, with much of the area receiving over 2000 mm per year.

Great care must be taken, especially when tramping in remote or alpine regions, as the weather can change from benign sunshine to life-threatening, hypothermia inducing conditions of gales and snow in a matter of hours (even in summer, in the high country). Even on day trips you should check the weather forecast, make sure you know your route, make sure someone knows where you are going and carry some rain and cold weather gear and supplies. Many places are very remote and far from help and care is recommended – every year New Zealand search and rescue teams are called in to find tourists missing in remote regions and every year, at least a few end up as hospitalised casualties.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["North Island"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Stewart Island"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Chatham Islands"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["usableregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["-43.9"],["170"],["zoom=7"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["New Zealand"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["related"],["Driving_in_New_Zealand"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:South Island"]]}]
