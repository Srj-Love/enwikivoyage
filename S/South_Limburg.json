With the 322.7 meters Vaalserberg being the highest point, the South Limburg hills aren't nearly as high as those low mountain ranges just across the borders. Nonetheless, it provides lovely scenic views and a strong contrast to the strikingly flat lands that define the rest of the Netherlands.\n\nThe river Meuse runs through the region, from south to north. It is called Maas in Dutch and several town, including the Limburgian capital Maastricht, are named after it. The Meuse depositions account for a large part of the South Limburg surface.\nThe touristic appeal of the region doesn't lie in its landscape alone. The South-Limburg countryside is dotted with charming villages, farms, ancient churches and a good number of castles. In many villages and most of the cities, old buildings in the historic center remain.  As it has been a relatively popular destination for many decades, tourism has become a main source of income for the region. Not only hotels and restaurants are plentiful, but also attractions particularly developed to entertain tourists.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["VVV Tourist Information Zuid Limburg"]},". Major cities like Maastricht have a specified tourist information office but even in small villages you will usually find a VVV information point with maps and leaflets, e.g. in a local supermarket.

The oldest traces of farming in the Netherlands were also discovered in this region, where the fertile loess grounds led to farming initiatives long before the rest of the Netherlands. In Roman times the region was Romanized throughout. The Romans laid the foundations for Maastricht and Heerlen, now two of the main cities in South Limburg. Christianity was introduced in 384 by Servatius and would play a major role in the further history of the region. This later canonized bishop became the patron saint of the city Maastricht and his grave became a popular pilgrimage destination.\n\nThe mostly Catholic population of South Limburg, like the rest of Dutch and Belgian Limburg, strongly opposed its absorption by the Reformist Northern provinces and fought alongside the Spanish. Still today almost 75% of its population is Catholic, although ever fewer people actually practice their faith.\n\nThroughout its history, South Limburg was a mostly rich and flourishing area. It was constantly disputed between regional duchies, the French, the Prussians, the Dutch and the Spanish. From around 1900 to the 1960s, the economy blossomed as coal mining activities developed. The closure of the mines in the mid 60's led to severe unemployment, as up to 15% of the population had been working for pr in the mines. In recent decades, the South Limburg administration has made strong investments to change and renew the local economy. Beside the fast development of tourism, the region has also tried to established itself as a European cooperation hub, especially focusing on its central position in the Meuse-Rhine Euroregion.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nA large part of the South-Limburg population speaks a form of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Limburgish"]},", a dialect that shares many characteristics with both Dutch and German. People from different villages all speak their own specific variety of the dialect, but are still well able to communicate amongst each other. In villages and small towns you'll find that Limburgisch is the main colloquial language used by locals in every day life. This often extends to interaction with locals just across the German and Belgian border, as they too speak versions of Limburgish.\n\nIn the Netherlands, Limburgish has been recognised as an official regional language and it therefor enjoys a certain level of protection under chapter 2 of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. However, the validity of that status is an ongoing subject of debate among linguists.\n\nOf course, Dutch remains the official language. You'll find that everyone speaks it, although many people do so with an accent. Virtually all written information (including menu's and signs) are in Dutch. As in the rest of the Netherlands, the command of English is fairly good and many Limburgish people also speak a good word of German.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nGetting in is fairly easy as there are quite many road and public transport connections to the rest of the Netherlands but also to Germany and Belgium.
