November to December is hot and humid and January to April is the rainy (or \"green\") season, some lodges close during this period, other give reduced rates. The rainy season is the best time to go birdwatching.  From March to June is the best time to spot the elusive African wild dog.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThere are two major access points for the park: ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mfuwe Gate"]},", near the village of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mfuwe"]]}," and connected by bridge, and the less used ",{"type":"'''","value":["Nyamaluma"]}," 50 km to the southwest, where a pontoon ferries vehicles across the river.\n\nMost tour groups will offer either the option to fly into Mfuwe or have a private vehicle pick you up (i.e., from Lusaka, Chipata, Lilongwe, etc.). Although these options offer the most convenient and comfortable means of getting to the park, they are not the only means of entry--and one can also access Mfuwe by means of public transport through much of the year.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nThe nearest airport is in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mfuwe"]]},", which offers flights to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lusaka"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Livingstone"]]},", as well as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lilongwe"]]}," (Malawi).

It's possible to complete the journey in as little as 2 hours in the dry season in a high clearance vehicle (longer if a public vehicle is being used), but travel is more difficult, occasionally even impossible, in the wet season.  Trucks ply the road, but can take more than seven very bumpy hours. In March 2008 the journey took 2.5 hours in a high clearance 4x4 private vehicle.\n\nFrom Chipata, it's 1.5 hours (2-3 hours public transport) to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lilongwe"]]}," depending on the time it takes to cross the border and 8-10 hours to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lusaka"]]},".\n\nThere is a rarely used very scenic track from Petauke down the escapement and along the Luangwa northward to Mfuwe, but it's best not attempted unless you're traveling in convoy and can repair any problems that crop up.  Expect 8 hours for this unforgettable trip of 180 km.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By public transport"]},"\nSouth Luangwa remains one of the few national parks suitable for budget travelers. Lodges offer relatively cheap rates (some with dorms), and the park can be accessed by public transport as well. Although as has been mentioned above most travelers access the park by way of plane or private vehicle (and most tour companies only have information about these two methods), it is also possible to reach by public transport from Chipata.\n\nGETTING TO CHIPATA FROM LILONGWE: Either (a) Take a minibus from the Lilongwe minibus stand toward Mchinji (~2 hrs: 1000 MWK in May 2012), then a taxi or shared taxi to the border (15 min: 500 MWK). After crossing the border, take a taxi or shared taxi to Chipata (15 min: 15000 ZMK). (b) Take a bus from Lilongwe to Lusaka, but depart at Chipata. 'Zambia-Malawi' is a reputable company.\n\nGETTING TO CHIPATA FROM LUSAKA: Take a bus to Chipata (~7hrs, 130,000 ZMK Apr 2012). Buses depart from InterCity Bus Terminal. Zambia-Malawi, Johabie, and possibly Juldans operate on a fixed time schedule (often referred to as 'time buses' by locals), but other coaches operate closer to minibuses (leave when enough passengers have boarded, which may take several hours or all day).  If in doubt, ask locals or staff members, though the latter are more likely to mislead you. You will need to catch the first bus out of Lusaka in order to arrive in time to catch the same-day minibus to Mfuwe. If you do this, it is advisable that you coordinate with the minibus driver so that he anticipates your arrival.\n\nONCE IN CHIPATA: There are nearly daily minibuses that run from Chipata to Mfuwe, the town just outside the entry to the Park. The PPDAZ minibus departs in the early afternoon (2pm) after collecting passengers and sometimes goods (i.e., to deliver to Mfuwe stores), and takes 3-3.5 hours.  There are other minibuses that may also bring passengers to Mfuwe, but, as opposed to the PPDAZ minibus (which leaves at a fixed time), are passenger-dependent and will only leave when full.  The ride from Chipata to Mfuwe costs 60-70 ZMW (~$11 as of May 2014), though you may pay more if you request to be dropped off directly at your lodge or simply for being a 'muzungu.' To confirm your spot on the minibus and coordinate it's pick-up (can pick you up pretty much anywhere in Chipata), call the driver (John--a very friendly and honest Zambian) at 0967384620 (+260967384620 if calling from Malawi). Call 1-2 days in advance.\n\nThere are generally two ways of returning from Mfuwe to Chipata.  The PPDAZ bus leaves early in the morning (5:30AM), and will arrive mid-morning\/noon in Chipata.  Alternatively, the more traditional minibus tends to leave around 6:30-8:00pm (~4hrs to Chipata by night) and costs 60-100 ZMW (<$17 as of May 2014). The minibus will drop you at the Chipata bus stand. If you are doing this with the intention of taking a morning bus to Lusaka, it is possible to buy your bus ticket when you arrive at the Chipata bus stand, then sleep on the bus until it departs in the morning. This is a safe (though can be cold) way to avoid the hassle of finding a hotel late at night upon arriving in Chipata.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["With a tour group"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Kiboko Safaris"],["url=http:\/\/www.kiboko-safaris.com"],["email=enquiries@kiboko-safaris.com"],["address=Mandala Road 4\/278, Old Town, Lilongwe"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+265 1 751226"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=This hotel and travel company based in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lilongwe"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Malawi"]]}," runs reasonably priced all-inclusive tours round-trip from Lilongwe."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Jackalberry Safaris"],["url=http:\/\/www.jackalberrysafaris.net"],["email=info@jackalberry.net"],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=The company runs affordable 3,4 and 5 day all-inclusive tours from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chipata"]]}," with an interesting range of itineraries that include both game viewing and cultural activities.
