There was much damage inflicted during the 2008 war and rehabilitation of the region is slow and stifled by corruption; government control is weak. Nearly 89% of the region is above 1,000 m; the southern lowlands are influenced by the same subtropical climate that blesses lowland Georgia.\n\nA person of Ossetia (oh-SEH-tee-ah) is an Ossete (oh-SEET).The ethnicity and the language are Ossetian (oh-SEH-tee-ahn).The Ossetes are different from the Georgians and belong the ancient nation of Alans.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s the Soviet Union was undermined by strong nationalist feelings among its various peoples, and the South Ossetians moved to merge with their North Ossetian neighbours in Russia. The Georgian government overruled this and tried to establish full Georgian control over South Ossetia. Alarmed Ossetes pressed for recognition of their autonomy, some sought full secession from Georgia and a union with Russia. The first full-scale war between Ossetian separatists and the Georgian national government started in early 1991 and lasted until 1992.\n\nAfter that war, South Ossetia was effectively independent; the Georgian government had little control over the highly autonomous region. Georgia's ",{"type":"'''","value":["Rose Revolution"]}," of 2003 established a government keen to regain the lost control over South Ossetia and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Abkhazia"]]},", a region which had a similar separatist post-Soviet history.\n\nGeorgia's heavy handed and clumsy handling of the situation culminated in 2008 when it shelled South Ossetia's capital ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tskhinvali"]]}," as part of a military campaign to assert its authority. This back-fired grandly when the Russian army poured through the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Roki Tunnel"]}," and overran much of Georgia proper. A ceasefire was forced on the Georgians and the Russians withdrew to the boundaries of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Abkhazia"]]}," and South Ossetia, leaving them well beyond Georgian control.\n\nSince \"liberating\" the region, the Russian government has tried to merge it with Russia, but has come up with no success due to impediments from both Georgia and from the South Ossetians themselves.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Politics"]},"\nWhile the separatist conflict between the Ossetes and the Georgian central government has cooled to a much lower level than during the 2008 war and despite a heavy Russian \"peace-keeping\" military presence, security and government control are both weak. The Ossetians are largely grateful for Russia's military intervention against Georgia. Many South Ossetes fled during the 2008 war: the 2007 population was 70,000, in 2012 it was 55,000.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nThe people of South Ossetia can speak Ossetian, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Russian phrasebook"],["Russian"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Georgian phrasebook"],["Georgian"]]},".
