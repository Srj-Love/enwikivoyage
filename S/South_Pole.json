The Earth's axis, and therefore the position of the South Pole, is constantly subject to wobbles of up to several meters known as ",{"type":"''","value":["polar motion"]},". However, the \"South Pole\" — that is, the one defined as 90°S — remains in a fixed position for practical reasons, like keeping coordinates steady, with polar motion and the precise definition of the South Pole only relevant for certain scientific activities. Unlike the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Pole"]]},", which is nothing but a sheet of ice floating on the surface of the Arctic Ocean, the geographic South Pole is located on solid ground, allowing a permanent research station to be built at the site of the pole itself.  Although it was once an elusive goal that took the lives of many explorers, thanks to modern technology, it has been permanently staffed since 1956. The overwhelming majority of the South Pole's visitors are scientists and support staff for the U.S. Antarctic Program and the Antarctic research arms of other nations visiting the station. The station can also now be reached by commercial travel expeditions, although the high cost (around USD $45,000+) keeps private visitor numbers very low. The actual pole is marked by a metal rod, adjusted on New Year's Day each year to account for the movement of the ice around the site.\n\nThe \"South Pole\" is also defined magnetically, where all field lines of the Earth's magnetic field point upwards, which continues to be important for navigational purposes.  The ",{"type":"'''","value":["South Magnetic Pole"]}," drifts around, located in the Southern Ocean at 64°31′48″S 137°51′36″E in 2005 and moving by about 10–15 km per year. Since there's nothing particularly interesting about it other than perhaps watching your compass not work, it receives no visitors. It is not to be confused with the confusingly-similar ",{"type":"'''","value":["South Geomagnetic Pole"]},", located at 79.74°S 108.22°E near Vostok Station in 2005 and wobbling slightly over time. The Earth's magnetic field can be likened to a strong bar magnet, with two polar opposites. The South Geomagnetic Pole lies where a line of best for this field intersects the surface in the Southern hemisphere. The South Magnetic Pole is where the ",{"type":"''","value":["actual"]}," field lines come together, since the field is not perfectly symmetrical and does not conform to a straight axis.\n\nOf interest to explorers and adventurers is the pole of inaccessibility marking the furthest point from any easily-reached geographic feature. The ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["East Antarctica#See"],["Southern pole of inaccessibility"]]}]}," is the furthest point in Antarctica from any coastline, although the exact location is disputed due to the difficulty in defining Antarctica's coastline — whether to consider the \"solid\" coastline where rock\/soil reaches sea level or factor in the massive, ever-changing ice sheets. A modern calculation puts its location at 85°50′S 65°47′E. The British Antarctic Survey has calculated its position as 82°53′14″S 55°4′30″E when accounting only for the Antarctic land surface proper or at 83°50′37″S 65°43′30″E when ice sheets are taken into account. The Soviet Union built the ",{"type":"''","value":["Pole of Inaccessibility"]}," station at 82°06′S 54°58′E, 878 km (546 mi) from the geographical South Pole, and at an elevation of 3,800 m (12,467 ft). However, the station was only occupied from 14–26 December, 1958 before it was suspended indefinitely because of safety concerns that it was too far from other Soviet stations. While the Soviets planned to use the station afterwards for short visits, only a handful of people ever since have visited the site, which is now buried by snow except for a bust of Vladimir Lenin perched atop its roof. The Soviet station and other calculated coordinates for the pole of accessibility are all unremarkable and, as the name suggests, difficult to reach. Only the most extreme adventurers itching to cross \"I've been to the most inaccessible corner of Antarctica\" off their dream list are likely to be interested in visiting the pole of inaccessibility.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Antarctica regions map.png"],["thumb"],["250px"]]},"\n\nThe first persons to successfully reach the south pole were the four men of a party led by Roald Amundsen, who reached the pole on 14 December 1911.

A U.S. Navy plane with two crew aboard flew over the pole on 29 November 1929. \n\nNo one stepped foot on the south pole until 1956, when another U.S. Navy plane reached the pole, landing this time. Over the summer of 1956–'57, the U.S. constructed a station as part of the International Geophysical Year, which has been permanently staffed since. The first people to reach the pole ",{"type":"''","value":["overland"]}," (with limited air support) were Edmund Hillary and Vivian Fuchs, who arrived separately in January 1958. The opening of Patriot Hills — the first privately-supported logistics camp in Antarctica — in 1987 opened the way for persons not on government-supported expeditions to access the South Pole. For winter 2010–'11, the company operating Patriot Hills moved to a new camp, Union Glacier Camp, which has a blue-ice (exceptionally solid) runway allowing large, wheeled cargo aircraft to arrive from South America and accommodates Twin Otter and Basler BT-67 ski-equipped planes to make the journey to the South Pole.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nIt's tempting to say that the climate at the South Pole is consistently bone-chilling cold, but it is not.

(Note that there are no \"day-time highs\" or \"night-time lows\" in these figures, because the sun only sets and rises once each year.)  Snowfall is scarce; since weather systems rarely penetrate into inland Antarctica and because the temperature is often too low, hence its desert status.
