From the 6th to the 9th century, the region was settled by the Bavarii together with the Langobards and the romanised natives. As part of France and later the Holy Roman Empire, the region had a strategic importance as a bridgehead to Italy. Large parts of the province was donated to the Bishops of Trent and Brixen. After their caretakers, the earls of Tyrol (like Meinhard II of Gorizia-Tyrol) had gathered the province under their command, the region together with the valleys to the north was known as Tyrol.\n\nIn 1342, the earldom went over to the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bavaria"]]},"n dukes again when Emperor Louis IV voided the first marriage of Countess Margarete Maultasch. But already in 1363, the Wittelsbach released the country for Habsburg.\n\nHabsburg ruled the region almost continuously until 1918. It was only in 1805 when Austria was defeated by Napoleon and lost Tyrol to Bavaria in the Peace of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bratislava"],["Pressburg"]]}," (Bavaria allied itself with Napoleon in the war). Tyroleans, lead by Andreas Hofer, rose in rebellion against Bavarian rule. In 1814, Tyrol is transferred again from Bavaria to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Austria"]]}," at the Congress of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vienna"]]},".\n\nIn 1919, after the First World War, South Tyrol was annexed by ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Italy"]]}," as a war prize. Government officials, soldiers and other settlers brought in by the Italian state, especially the Fascist regime, from all over Italy and reached a third of the total population by the early 1950s. Their official efforts attempted to erase the German cultural element of the area's history. Their descendants now make up about a quarter of the population.\n\nAs a result of the pact between Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, the German speakers in the region were given the option to relocate to Germany. Only few accepted, and most of them returned to their homeland after the war, anyway. During the end of the war, the region was briefly annexed to the Third Reich, briefly reuniting the Tyrol.\n\nAfter WWII, the region was returned to (remained part of) Italy as a province, but with large administrative and legislative autonomy, which finally took effect in the 1970's and 80's. Since the 1970's there have been repeated calls for full independence or reunification with Austria but this secessionist movement has yet to be embraced by any major German-speaking political parties preferring to embrace the very successful contemporary system of power sharing.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Geography"]},"\nSouth Tyrol is geographically the northernmost region of Italy and because of its history and location in the middle of the Alps it's still considered a Central European region although Italy is in Mediterranean (or Southern) Europe - it's also true that all regions in North-Eastern Italy consider themselves as ",{"type":"''","value":["Central European"]}," (actually they have more geographic similarities with  ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Slovenia"]]}," - which is considered fully Central European and located on the southern part of the Alps - than with the rest of Italy). The region is totally composed by high mountains and their valleys. The best known part of South Tyrolean Alps are the Dolomites with the Schlern (2,662 mt) or the Rosengarten (3,002 mt). The Dolomites are located in eastern South Tyrol while the highest mountains are in western South Tyrol with the Ortler Alps (highest peak - 3.902 mt). The Dolomites offer some of the most dramatic mountain scenery on the planet with their striking appearance, which has evolved over many millennia as erosion and weathering shaped what were originally under-sea coral reefs. They take their name from Deodat de Dolomieu, the French geologist who first described them. The most important river is the Adige\/Etsch which flows into the Adriatic Sea while the Eisack and Rienz are the two most important of the Adige's\/Etsch's affluents in South Tyrol. The Adige trench runs north - south, dividing the western (known as the Brenta) and eastern Dolomites. The only river which doesn't flow into the Adriatic Sea is the Drava which passes through most of the Central European countries and enters the Black Sea.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nThere are a lot of different and strange climates inside South Tyrol - normally South Tyrolean climate is sunny and dry and warmer than on the northern part of the Alps. That doesn't mean that the climate has to be Mediterranean - as local tourist guides say. The climate is of continental type (hot summers and cold winters with ambiguous springs and autumns) influenced by Alpine characteristics - for examples summer is the year's most rainy season. On the mountains and in upper valleys the climate is strongly alpine (very cold winters and fresh summers). During the winter and the springs in the valleys blows often the ",{"type":"''","value":["föhn"]}," - a strong wind which is normally warm in the winter and cold in the spring. Summers in the lower valleys (Bolzano and Merano surroundings) can be very sultry. Annual average temperature in Bolzano is 11.6°C and the extreme records there go from -17 to +40°C. On the upper valleys the temperature is considerably lower (annual average from 3 to 5°C). Winter is the better season for skiing, spring and autumn for hiking and visiting places and summer for hiking in the woods - pay attention to the weather conditions!\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["People & Culture"]},"\nSouth Tyrol is a region of multiple identities - South Tyrolean can differently feel themselves as Tyroleans, Austrians, of German ethnicity, Italians, Ladins or simply South Tyrolean - or \"Altoatesini\". Normally German-speaking people feel specifically South Tyroleans and Tyroleans on an historical level while Italian-speaking people feel mainly Italians or Italian-speaking South Tyroleans (or eventually \"Altoatesini\" - people from Upper Adige). Ladin-speaking people consider themselves as Ladins but historically as Tyrolean Ladins. Ethnic tension has been a major problem in the past but it is not the main topic in South Tyrol anymore and nowadays ethnic tensions play themselves out more inside political parties. It is true that history and politics are strictly connected here. For the most part and particular within the younger generations all three groups coexist in relative peace and harmony with the Ladins playing the role of a kind of middle-man peace broker in the past. The success of multi-cultural South Tyrol is largely due in part to the generous cultural and political autonomy that the region has been granted by Rome with the seal of approval from Vienna.\n\nFor the descendants of native Tyroleans the national hero is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Andreas Hofer"]}," who fought against the Revolutionary French in order to save their homeland's freedom. Other famous South Tyroleans are ",{"type":"'''","value":["Walther von der Vogelweide"]}," - the most celebrated of the Middle High German lyrics poet who was supposed to have been born near Bolzano - and the Medieval poet ",{"type":"'''","value":["Oswald von Wolkenstein"]},".\n\nGerman-speaking (but often without ethnic distinction) South Tyroleans have stereotypes in common with Bavarians - from the Italian point of view: ",{"type":"''","value":["Lederhosen"]}," (leather pants), sausages and a lot of beer. From Germany they are seen as Mediterranean, singers and wine drinkers. Alcohol is though a problem in South Tyrol's society for all ethnic groups - especially among the young.\n\nSouth Tyrol has two unofficial anthems: one is the Tyrolean anthem - which is officially recognized in Austrian Tyrol - and the other is a famous song (known as \"Bozner Bergsteigerlied\" or \"Südtirollied\") which begins with the words \"",{"type":"''","value":["Wohl ist die Welt so groß und weit..."]},"\" (",{"type":"''","value":["Surely is the world so big and wide..."]},"). Ladins have also their own anthems (Gherdëina Gherdëina for the Gardena Valley and a general anthem of Ladins).\nSouth Tyrol participate every year to the ",{"type":"''","value":["Gran Prix der Volksmusik"]}," which is broadcast in Eurovision - its first participation has been in 2001 and has won every year since then. The most known folk group are probably the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Kastelruther Spatzen"]},". Pop and rock are the preferred styles by the young.\n\nSouth Tyroleans are almost all Catholics and quite conservative - but it depends on the areas. In the most touristy developed regions and in cities or bigger towns people are more open. It's said that there is no big differences in behavior of Germans or Italians - forming a nice inter-ethnic regional identity, some tourists affirm that local Italians are a bit closer and different from other Italians.\n\nToday the region is famous for its sporty people such as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Isolde"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Carolina Kostner"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["Armin Zöggeler"]}," (sled's world champion) or ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ylenia Scapin"]},". Other famous people include the former journalist and now European parliamentary ",{"type":"'''","value":["Lilli Gruber"]},".

Highway A22 is a toll road and paying is compulsory. In South Tyrol police seems to be much less tolerant than in other parts of Italy, so pay attention and keep to the rules.\n\nTraffic signs are always very precise and the usage of pictographs is more common than in other parts of Europe since in South Tyrol two or three languages have to be used. In most parts of South Tyrol signs are written in the German\/Italian order, while in Bolzano and other smaller Italian-speaking areas in Italian\/German. Also complimentary information is bilingual. In the Ladin-speaking valleys road signs are trilingual - Ladin\/German\/Italian.\n\nSpeed limits are:\n",{"type":"*","value":["130 km\/h on highways (green traffic sign);"]},{"type":"*","value":["110 km\/h on freeways (blue traffic sign - similar to a free highway);"]},{"type":"*","value":["90 km\/h on single-lane roads (blue traffic sign);"]},{"type":"*","value":["50 km\/h inside cities (after the white traffic sign on which is written the place name)."]},"\nItalian laws allow a 5% tolerance on local speed limit and fines are generally very expensive.\n\nMotorbikes should drive always with the headlights on, for other vehicles that applies only outside cities.

Also driving after having taking drugs is illegal.\nAll passengers are required to wear their seat belt and children under 10 must use the back seat.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bike"]},"\n\nSouth Tyrol has one of the most developed bike trail systems in Italy and especially in the valleys you can reach most of the towns in the region and also in the surrounding regions. Along bike trails there are a lot of lay over points. The majority of bike trails begin in Bolzano\/Bozen. On the web site of the regional government you can find the maps of the bike trail systems in South Tyrol divided by districts or Bezirke.(German and Italian). In this region are different shops for the rental of bicycles, if you want come or extend your tour from the Veneto Region is recommended Venetian shop in Mira that can arrange  with a small fee : deliver pick-up,drop off and customized logistics support for move of your luggages\/bike.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Völser Rundweg.JPG"],["thumb"],["200px"],["Path near Völs am Schlern"]]}," \nThe official languages in South Tyrol are ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["German phrasebook"],["German"]]}]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Italian phrasebook"],["Italian"]]}]},". In general, everyone younger can speak and is taught Italian. One could say that most Ladin people can speak German as well but only a few Italian south tyrolians can speak German depending on where they live. If they live in big cities they are unlikely to speak German. Really to get around outside of Bolzano or Merano one should speak German. All road signs and services to the public have to be provided in both languages. In the regional parliament deputies can speak their mother tongue and laws have to be published bilingual. In addition to German and Italian in South Tyrol there is a third semi-officially recognized language - ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ladin"]},". This ancient language originated after the invasion of the Ancient Romans in the Alpine region is spoken in the Gardena and Badia valleys - and also in the Fassa Valley in Trentino and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cortina d'Ampezzo"]]}," area in Veneto. Ladin has a fully official status in the valleys in which it's spoken and also in the capital is common to see trilingual signs - but not road signs. It is a sister language of Romansh still spoken in eastern Switzerland and Fruali spoken in north-eastern Italy.\n\nEvery 10 years during the census South Tyrolean have to declare their ethnic affiliation in order to decide the percentage which has to be given at working places to German-, Italian- or Ladin-speakers. In the last census 69.15% declared to be German-speaking, 27.65% is Italian-speaking and 4.37% is Ladin-speaking.\n\nItalian-speaking South Tyroleans live mostly in Bolzano - about 55% of the whole Italian-speaking population, and they are a majority in 4 other municipalities: its metropolitan area - the three metropolitan municipalities of Laives, Bronzolo and Vadena, and in the village of Salorno which borders Italian-speaking Trentino to the south. Other big Italian-speaking communities are located in the most important towns such as Meran, Brixen, Sterzing and generally in the Wipp Valley. Ladin-speaking people are a majority in 8 municipalities and there are small minorities in Bolzano (0.71%), Brixen and Bruneck. German-speaking South Tyrolean are the dominant group in 103 of 116 municipalities - the most German-speaking village is Sankt Pankraz with a 99.81% german-speaking population. In general the more rural, the more likely the inhabitants speak German.\n\nIn everyday life most of German-speaking South Tyroleans speak their local dialect, generally called ",{"type":"''","value":["Südtirolerisch"]}," but this has a lot of varieties from location to location. The South Tyrolean German dialect is related to the Bavarian dialects spoken in Austria and Bavaria. Some loan words have been taken from Italian - especially bad words, though! A local Italian dialect exists only in the area of Laives in the Bolzano metropolitan area - here Italian-speakers of ancestors from Trentino speak a dialect of central Trentino mixed with local German dialect (this dialect is commonly called ",{"type":"''","value":["Laivesòt"]},"). Only old Italian-speakers can speak the dialect (mostly Venetian) of origin being the others born in South Tyrol where the literary standard was the solution in order to communicate - however in local Italian there is a regional Venetian substrate as well as German influences. Ladin has no officially recognized literary standard - but it exists - and Ladins speak in South Tyrol two different dialects: Gherdeina and Badiot.\n\nSo, if you're going to go to South Tyrol it would be better to know some words of German instead of Italian, especially if you decide to visit villages and the mountains - in some valleys some local populations could have problems understanding foreigners speaking Italian, which is for them a foreign language too particular if they are older.\n\nEnglish is spreading fast and especially younger people can speak it - but this depends on their education level. English is a compulsory subject in South Tyrolean schools. In hotels, tourist offices and tourist places English is well known. In other places it would be better if you know some words of German (or Italian).\nFrench is not so popular but especially in Bolzano and other towns some young people can speak a little French.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Currency"]},"\nBeing South Tyrol a part of Italy and consequently of the Eurozone the official currency is the Euro. The best rates for changing money are offered by banks.

Most touristy developed areas are more expensive than the regional average. For example accommodations in the Bolzano metropolitan area town of Laives are cheaper. There is big differences also in prices between hotels of the same category - so a three star hotel could have similar prices to four but also two star hotels. Four and five stars hotels could ask more than €100 for a night staying but two stars hotels ask less than €40 (except in highly touristy developed areas). If you want to save money avoid to reserve a room in famous places and prefer near but less popular locations. Youth hostels are cheap if you see that the quality is much higher than European standards. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Tipping"]},"\nIn South Tyrol tipping is not so common - however in tourist areas it's quite normal and accepted.

It's to note that also typical meals are to be found frozen in supermarkets like e.g. spätzele, knödel and schlutzkrapfen. A local company called Nägele produces a lot of popular juices but also local coke and spetzi (coke mixed with lemonade). You can find the South Tyrolean coke in glass bottles in some supermarkets and in their store in Algund near Meran.
