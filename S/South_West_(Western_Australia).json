Bicycle touring, especially around the Margaret River region, is popular, but as always requires some preparation and route planning - the roads in the area often have no shoulder and have fast traffic.\n\nA map can give you little indication of driving times, and even GPS and online mapping services can grossly misrepresent these times.

If doing this loop, it is unusual to allow more than a day for the trip to Albany, as the road is featureless and the towns are small.  Allow much more time in Albany, and for the return trip.  The roads are slower, and there are many stopping opportunities, beaches, sights and diversions of the roads for parks and walks.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Canoeing, kayaking and rafting"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Caving"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cycling"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Diving"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Hiking"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mountain biking"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Nature walks"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Rock climbing and abseiling"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Scenic drives"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Surfing"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Swimming"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Whale watching"]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Winery tours and wine tastings"]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Marron"]}," - a local crayfish with a sweet lobster taste, that makes good eating."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Cheese and dairy"]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Western Australia"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:South West (Western Australia)"]]}]
