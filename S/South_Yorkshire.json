This quaint English restaurant is a beautiful stone building built in the 18th century with intimate dining rooms and a friendly, informal atmosphere. Their menu is both original in style, but with traditional roots, with choices like smoked haddock fishcakes with hollandaise; baked Portobello mushroom with goats cheese, pesto and pine nuts on a crostini and rocket base or a warm salad of bacon, mushrooms and Stilton with a honey and mustard dressing. Main courses might wander between salmon fillet with Yorkshire asparagus in puff pastry with butter sauce; locally sourced chicken supreme filled with stilton and tarragon wrapped in bacon with a light cheese sauce and pesto drizzle; oven roasted belly pork, apple and black pudding with a creamy cracked pepper sauce and a vegetarian option of gruyere and asparagus tartlette with roasted baby plum tomatoes. There is always a choice of steaks as well, with appropriate accompanying sauces. All the food is prepared daily by owner, Anita Bradley, and Head Chef, Lee Haigh, with an emphasis on locally sourced ingredients."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["53.5000"],["-1.3333"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Yorkshire"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:South Yorkshire"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:South Yorkshire"]]}]
