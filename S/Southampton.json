The Roman Ruins are situated in a suburb called Bitterne Manor. In Saxon times the town was known as Hamwic. Its privileged position on England's south coast made it Britain's premier trading post. The town became walled in the medieval era, and some remnants of these defences remain throughout the city, most notably the Bargate in the middle of the city centre. Southampton was devastated by bombing during the Second World War, meaning that much of the city and its heritage was destroyed. As such the town and its architecture has quite a modern feel to it.\n\nSouthampton has grown rapidly in the past 30 years, becoming one of the twenty largest cities in England. The two Universities (Solent University and University of Southampton) mean that there is a large student population (in term time).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nSouthampton is serviced by ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.southamptonairport.com\/ Southampton International Airport"]}]},", located a short distance outside the city in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Eastleigh (Hampshire)"],["Eastleigh"]]},".
