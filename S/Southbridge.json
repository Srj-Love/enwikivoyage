Southbridge is a close-knit community with a downtown area of friendly small businesses. The area was initially inhabited by the Nipmuck and Mohegan tribes, with the Quinebaug River dividing their territories. In 1730, it was settled by Europeans. Water power from the Quinebaug River made Southbridge a good location for sawmills and gristmills in the 18th century, and textile mills in the 19th century. After the Civil War, many immigrants of Irish and French Canadian descent came to work and live there; by the 1930s they had been joined by Poles, Greeks, Italians and others. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe principal road in Southbridge is Route 131, known as Main Street through downtown and East Main Street past the \"AO Rotary\" and through Sandersdale, a village on the town's east side.
