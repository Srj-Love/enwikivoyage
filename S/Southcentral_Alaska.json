From Anchorage, the highway goes in two directions, either south to the Kenai Peninsula or north to the MatSu Valley (Palmer and Wasilla), where the road splits into either the Parks Highway (Denali, Fairbanks) or the Glenn Highway (Glennallen, Canada). The Alaska Railroad (http:\/\/www.akrr.com\/) runs passenger trains to Seward on the Kenai Peninsula in the summer and north to Fairbanks year round. There are plenty of rental car agencies in Anchorage, but it is important to book ahead in the high season. There is a bus service south to the Kenai (http:\/\/www.homerstageline.com\/) year round. There is public transportation in Anchorage (People Mover: http:\/\/www.muni.org\/transit1\/index.cfm) and Fairbanks.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nStay away from Moose!
