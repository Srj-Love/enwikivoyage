The only real clue is the Texas Canyon rest stop on I-10; there's little else to suggest that there's more here than tumbleweeds and rocks. Leave the interstate, however, and soon you find yourself in storied cowboy and Indian country: the land of Wyatt Earp and the Clanton brothers, and of Geronimo's last stand. There's much more than that here, though, as the oldest documented evidence of human inhabitants anywhere on North America is located in this region. To really experience all of this the traveler should leave the highway, and, ideally, the pavement.\n\nCulturally there is a long history of human activity here, beginning with the Clovis culture approximately 9000 BCE, and continuing through the pre-Columbian and early Spanish periods. Besides scattered petroglyphs and pictographs and adobe ruins, however, there's little from this early history for the traveler to easily appreciate. In contrast, the region's more recent Apache, Mexican, and American history is inescapable. With the exception of the Chiricahua Apaches, who were sadly forcibly removed in the 19th century, the influence of this cultural melange continues to the present day.\n\nGeographically the region is characterized by basin and range topography punctuated by Madrean Sky Islands, a landscape which is unique to southeastern Arizona, southwestern New Mexico, and northern Sonora, Mexico. The desert valleys are hot and arid, while the mountain ranges are covered by cool pine and oak forests, with corresponding cooler temperatures.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Read"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Richard Shelton"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["Going Back to Bisbee"]},".
