Both Chinese and Western traders made and lost fortunes, and wars were fought over trading rights. A host of \"missionaries, mercenaries and misfits\" from all over the world poured in while education, production, modernisation, corruption, consumption, and seduction all went on at a furious pace. Today the area is far less wild, but it is still booming and still attracts many foreign residents.\n\nThe region has also been the source of much migration. The vast majority of overseas Chinese can trace their ancestry to one of these three provinces, and all three have descendants more-or-less everywhere. In any Western country, most people of Chinese descent can trace their roots to Guangdong, and the commonest style of Chinese food in the West is Cantonese (Guangdong) food.
