Sioux Falls being South Dakota's largest city has many attractions. Falls Park in downtown Sioux Falls is a major attraction for locals and tourists alike. In the southern part of the region near the Missouri River you will find a lot of recreational fun. Just west of Yankton is Lewis and Clark Lake and a camp ground. If you are some one who likes to explore the country this is paradise for you. Scattered west of Yankton are several small farming villages such as Avon, Tyndall, Lestervill, Scotland, and Tabor. The highlight of this area is Czech Days located in Tabor. This celebration of Czech Catholic heritage takes place every June. East of Yankton are the villages of Gayville and Volin; these towns offer little more than a glance at small town America but might still be worth passing by if you have the time. Continuing East you will come to Vermillion, a bustling college town home to the Dakota Dome.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["South Dakota"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["no Wikipedia link"]]}]
