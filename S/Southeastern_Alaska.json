Due to the high fjords and rocky shorelines, there are very few roads in this part of Alaska.  Most villages are linked by State funded ferry service - The Alaska Marine Highway, as well as seaplane and land plane service.\n\nJuneau is the hub for the Alaska marine highway, offering frequent trips to Haines, Skagway, and Sitka; with less frequent ferries to Petersburg, Wrangell, and Ketchikan.  Many smaller villages get service only once or twice a month.  Haines & Skagway have links to the Alcan Highway, and many travelers opt to drive to these two points to catch the daily ferry to Juneau and then on to other destinations; Prince Rupert also has frequent ferry service (3 times a week) to Ketchikan and Juneau.  Ferry service from Bellingham links most of the larger villages\/towns, however it only operates twice a month in the winter and three times a month in the summer; space fills up quickly so reservations need to be made far in advance.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Itineraries"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Sea Kayaking"]},"  Wilderness kayak camping tours to view humpback whales and other marine wildlife, also tidewater glaciers and icebergs.
