The large urban areas comprised of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Los Angeles"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["San Diego"]]}," stretch all along the coast from Ventura to the Southland and Inland Empire to San Diego.\n\nTo the west of Southern California lies the Pacific Ocean and Channel Islands. To the south is the international border between the United States and Mexico. Towards the Arizona state border in the east lies the Colorado Desert and the Colorado River, and towards the Nevada state border lies the Mojave Desert. Though there is no official definition for the northern boundary of Southern California, most include all the land south of the Sierra Nevada Mountains and the Tehachapi Mountains.\n\nSouthern California is a culturally diverse and well known area worldwide. Many tourists frequently travel to South Coast for its popular beaches, and to the eastern Desert for its dramatic open spaces. Southern California, along with the San Francisco Bay Area, is a major cultural and economic center for the State of California and beyond.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Regions"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:SoCal.png"],["400px"],["right"]]},"\nSouthern California is most easily divisible by counties.

A region with both national and global recognition, Southern California is often considered the home to many tourist destinations and the hub of economic activity for its respective regions. Each region is further divided into many culturally distinct areas, but as a whole they combine to create the Southern California atmosphere.\n\nOut of these regions, three are major metropolitan areas, each of which have over 3 million people. The Los Angeles area has over 12 million inhabitants, the Riverside-San Bernardino area has over 4 million inhabitants, and the San Diego area has over 3 million inhabitants. The region as a whole is practically identical in population to Texas, with more than 24.2 million people, and is the nation's most populous region behind the urban seaboard of the Northeastern United States.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\n\nSome of the major cities in the Southern California region include:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Long Beach"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Los Angeles"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Pasadena"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["San Diego"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Urban Landscape"]},". Southern California consists of a heavily developed urban environment, along with vast areas that have been left undeveloped. It is the second largest urbanized region in the United States, first being the Philadelphia\/New York\/Boston Northeastern areas. These cities are considered dense, with major downtown populations and significant rail and transit systems, but much of Southern California is famous for its large, spread-out, suburban communities and use of automobiles and highways. The dominant areas are Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego, Riverside, and San Bernardino, each of which is the center of its respective metropolitan area, composed of numerous smaller cities and communities.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Natural Landscape"]},". Southern California consists of geologic, topographic, and natural ecosystem landscapes in a diverse setting, outnumbering other major regions across the state\/country. The region spans from the Pacific Ocean islands, shorelines, beaches, and coastal plains, through the Peninsular Ranges with their peaks, into the large\/small interior valleys, to the vast Deserts of California. Each year, the area has about 10,000 earthquakes. Nearly all of them are so small that they are not felt. Only several hundred are greater than magnitude 3.0, and only about 15-20 are greater than magnitude 4.0.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\n\nSouthern California is home to numerous world-famous attractions including Disneyland, the San Diego Zoo, Legoland, and others.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Disneyland"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Knott's Berry Farm"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Six Flags Magic Mountain"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nEnglish is the official language of California and is the predominant language in Southern California.

A Thomas Guide, which contains detailed maps of all neighborhoods, is a useful tool if you plan on doing any driving in Southern California.  This book can be found in local stores and bookstores.\n\nThe freeways and highways are one of the major trademarks of the region. Extensive and complex freeway networks criss-cross the quickly-growing region, connecting urban centers with their suburbs, as well as the areas of urban sprawl between them.
