Grain-rising has historically been the major economical sphere in Dobruja and thus in previous centuries an important economical region. As a result, the area was suitable for a government centre an was the home of the first two capitals of Bulgaria. For centuries, its fertile grounds generated the wealth of its owners so the region has always been well developed. The fruitful environment meant that even after Bulgaria gained back its independence from the Ottoman empire in the late 19th century, many Turks decided to stay in Dobrudja and live in the reinstated Bulgarian country. Today, the region has many ethnic Turks so it is not uncommon to hear people speaking Turkish for example. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cities"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dobrich"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Razgrad"]]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shumen"]]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Silistra"]]}," "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Targovishte"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Other destinations"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pliska"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Preslav"],["Veliki Preslav"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" \"1300 Years Bulgaria\" Memorial Park"]},{"type":"*","value":[" \"Abritus\" Archaeological Reserve"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Fort Shumen"]},{"type":"*","value":[" The Madara Rider"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Pliska - the first capital of Bulgaria"]},{"type":"*","value":[" \"Srebarna\" Nature Reserve"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Tombul Mosque"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Veliki Preslav - the second capital of Bulgaria"]},{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Bulgaria"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["43.42899"],["27.22961"],["zoom=9"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Southern Dobruja"]]}]
