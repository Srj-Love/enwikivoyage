The basic culture of south is essentially Dravidian culture, quite different from North India's Indo - East European culture. The people of South would remain down to earth, calm in spite of talents and riches. They respect castes and religious sentiments unlike their Northern neighbors. Historians and Scholars across the world have always admired the culture and language of South India.\n\nSouth India has a glorious history of more than 3000 years. With advent of Aryan civilization in early BC centuries, much of the Dravidian civilizations (said to be even base for Indus Valley civilization) resided to southern India, which soon became a major Dravidian bastion. Though Hinduism remained as the invisible thread that connected North and South, much of the culture and outlook remained entirely different with both parts of the country with the Vindhya mountains that successfully prevented Northern cultural dominance into south until Medieval periods.\n\nThe ancient history of South India was much attributed to large empires like the Hoysalas, Chalukyas, Gangas, Kadambas, Pallavas, Cholas, Pandyas and Cheras, all hailing from similar roots. Cholas are famous for their cultural monuments and navy which brought much of South East Asia under its domination. Cheras ruled much of Kongu Nadu (western Tamil Nadu) and Kerala, had extensive trading relations with West, particularly Roman and Greek Empires as well as with Egyptians. Pandiyas were renowned for their cultural achievements, concentrated much of Southern Tamil Nadu. Several other Hindu Dynasties like Chalukyas and Pallavas also contributed to the cultural heritage of the region.\n\nTowards Medieval periods, Vijayanagar Empire became one of the largest empires covering two thirds of South India, particularly Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh with its capital at Hampi. The frequent attacks of Sultans of Delhi and other Northern Muslim states, slowly weakened the great Vijayanagara Empire, disintegrating it, giving raise of several Muslim states modeled on Northern Mughal styles in south. The growth of Portuguese, Dutch and other European powers, made South India, one of the major bases for European powers to fight for its share, in which British emerged victorious. British started their expansion into India setting up its base in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chennai"],["Madras"]]}," and slowly growing into a major power all over India. Barring a few kingdoms which paid tribute to the Birtish like Travancore, Kochi, Mysore, Hyderabad and Coorg, most of the south Indian area came under British dominance by end of 19th century.\n\nAfter Independence, South India remained one of the major economic powerhouses for the nation. South Indian cities are reputed for industrial growth and overall development. The growth of IT in cities like Bangalore, Chennai and Hyderabad, textiles in Coimbatore, auto-manufacturing in Chennai, tourism in Kerala, made South Indian states to race ahead of North, in terms of economic prosperity, urbanization, human resource, educational and overall social development.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["seealso"],["Kannada phrasebook"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["seealso"],["Malayalam phrasebook"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["seealso"],["Tamil phrasebook"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["seealso"],["Telugu phrasebook"]]},"\n\nOne of the major differences between the South and the rest of India are the languages spoken.  The four major languages, ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Kannada phrasebook"],["Kannada"]]}]}," (in Karnataka), ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Malayalam phrasebook"],["Malayalam"]]}]}," (in Kerala), ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Tamil phrasebook"],["Tamil"]]}]}," (in Tamil Nadu) and ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Telugu phrasebook"],["Telugu"]]}]}," (in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh) are all ",{"type":"'''","value":["Dravidian languages"]}," entirely unrelated to the Indo-Aryan languages, such as Hindi, spoken in the rest of the country, though they contain many loan words from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sanskrit phrasebook"],["Sanskrit"]]},".  Even the scripts of all four languages have their own evolutions.\n\nAs a rule, throughout the South, English is better understood than ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hindi phrasebook"],["Hindi"]]},". The Tamils, in particular, have resented Delhi's occasional attempts to impose Hindi on them, and many will find it offensive if you try to talk to them in Hindi.  Learning a few words of the local lingo, on the other hand, will go down a treat. Outside Tamil Nadu, southern and coastal Andhra, Hindi is still usable in urban areas.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nSouth India has more international airports than rest of India with regular connections to almost every corner of the world.

The typical meal is ",{"type":"''","value":["sambar"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["koottu"]}," (a watery curry) with rice, or ",{"type":"''","value":["avial"]}," (mixed vegetables) with rice. There are regional variations too — the coastal regions make greater use of coconut and fish. In the State of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kerala"]]},", it is common to use grated coconut in everything and coconut oil for cooking, while someone from the interior could be surprised to learn that coconut oil, can in fact, be used for cooking. Anyway, all kinds of dishes from all parts of the world can be found in cities across South India.

For a non-vegetarian meal, curries or dishes cooked with mutton, chicken or fish are included. Meals are often accompanied by crisp appalams.  Refills of curry and rice are often free, with men with buckets walking around to serve you more.  After a final round of rice and curds or buttermilk or both, a traditional meal is concluded with a small banana and a few betel leaves and nuts.

So, tourists are advised to plan their travel accordingly. One might find it difficult to find public transport or cabs after 9.00. Also, it is advisable to not carry valuables or cash while traveling late. The four states have relatively better policing, and one can contact the police in case of any emergency by dialing 100. Free ambulance service can be reached by dialing 108. \n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["13.0000"],["77.0000"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["India"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:South India"]]}]
