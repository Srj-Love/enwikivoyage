That's still well visible in the architecture of churches and cathedrals, as well as in city centers. Nowadays, Catholicism is still the predominant religion in Limburg (where over 75% of people call themselves Catholic) and Brabant (just over half). It's said that the Catholic way of life brings a more bourgondic lifestyle to these provinces, especially in Limburg.\n\nTry not to refer to the country as \"Holland\" here, as people from the south live in ",{"type":"''","value":["the Netherlands"]},", and Holland is a synonym for the more northern and western parts.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Carnival"]},"\nIn Brabant and Limburg, ",{"type":"''","value":["Carnaval"]}," is celebrated widespread.

You will however find a few distinctive language characteristics compared to Standard Dutch. Most notable are the use of a soft G, sounding like the German 'ch', and the general use of a guttural R. Especially for non-native speakers, this often strong accent can make Dutch harder to understand around here. Nonetheless, you're very unlikely to encounter any serious trouble in communicating.\n\nA wide range of local and regional dialects are spoken throughout the region, although only Limburgisch has an official status. In some areas you'll find that e.g. street or town name signs are indicated both in Dutch and the local dialect.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nThe Southern Netherlands are accessible greatly from surrounding regions. The A12, A1, A40, A2 and A25 from Belgium might be good options, as well as the German Autobahns 4, 61 and 40. From the northern side, the A29, A16, A27, A2, A50 and A73 form the main options.

Make sure to buy an OV-chipcard, as that can be used on all buses and trains. Trains only serve larger and mid-sized destinations. The main intercity routes and some regional trains are operated by NS, while some others are operated by Veolia. Buses are operated by Veolia and Connexxion and serve pretty much every village around.

The ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Biesbosch National Park"]]}]}," is a popular destination for the Dutch and one of the last freshwater tide areas in Europa. It is characterized by a network of large and small creeks and best explored by boat. If you like scuba-diving, try the Oosterschelde Nationaal park. Its salty waters are filled with sea life, including some unique regional species.

In Zeeland, obviously oriented on the sea, fish and sea fruits are a major part of traditional cuisine. Zeeuwese ",{"type":"'''","value":["mussels"]}," are available all through the country in season, and the Oosterschelde, an estuary and national maritime park, is famous for the high quality ",{"type":"'''","value":["lobster"]}," that is caught there.

In spring, green and white ",{"type":"'''","value":["asparagus"]}," from Limburgian soil make their way to restaurant menus all over the Netherlands.

In the south, try ",{"type":"'''","value":["zuurvlees"]},", a specific kind of sweet and sour stew, a bit like some German kinds of \"sauerbraten\" but originally prepared with horse meat.

However, over the past decades wine orchards have popped up all over the Netherlands. This is especially true for the south, where wine making first started in Roman times, and where this tradition was rediscovered and brought back to life in the 1970s. Still today, no other Dutch region has as many vineyards as the Southern Netherlands, with the largest production volumes originating in the rolling hills of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South Limburg"]]},". Both in terms of quantity and quality, Dutch wines can't really compare to the massive and century old traditions of nearby Germany or France, but international tests are showing a steady increase in quality and some rather good examples. Apart from taste, the vineyards of course add to the charm of the landscapes, especially in the South.\n\nIn Zeeland, when you order apple juice, you've got a big chance you will get so-called ",{"type":"''","value":["Appelaere"]},", which is a brand name from a company that offers a turbid apple-drink from local Zeelandic apple orchards.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nLike most of the Netherlands, you'll typically be safe and your biggest worry should probably be pickpockets in crowded places.
