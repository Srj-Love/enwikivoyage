The names of some towns on the south coast are often pronounced differently than their French names might suggest. For instance:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Francois is often pronounced Franceway"]},{"type":"*","value":[" La Poile, La Pile"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Bay L'Argent, Bay Larjent"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Rencontre, Rencounter"]},"\nResidents will almost always recognize either pronunciation.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nGetting in to Southern Newfoundland can basically be done three ways:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Taking Highway 210 southwest from the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Trans-Canada Highway"]]}," (Highway 1) at the Goobies Visitor Centre, next to an Irving gas station and Truck, Stop, on the east side of the island"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Taking the road southeast from the TransCanada (Highway 1) at Barachols Pond Park that leads to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Burgeo"]]},"."]},{"type":"*","value":[" Continuing along the TransCanada east from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Port-aux-Basques"]]},", ending at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rose Blanche"]]},"."]},"\nHitchhiking in Southern Newfoundland is not too difficult. Though it can sometimes be a long wait for a ride, as not many cars drive on the key roads (e.g. the 210 or the TransCanada if you're trying to get from Rose Blanche to Port-aux-Basques), once you do get picked up there is a good chance that you will get a long ride. People are friendly, and will occasionally go out of their way to drop you off in a convenient location.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nAmong the appeals of traveling to Southern Newfoundland are the ferries, which go to a series of small towns many of which have no roads (or only small ones) and no cars, and so you get around by walking or driving on ATVs.\n\nPlanning your trip must be done in advance, as the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.tw.gov.nl.ca\/ferryservices\/ ferry schedule"]}," is somewhat irregular, and it is easy to get stuck in a town for a few days longer than you would like if you haven't considered when the next ferry will come. If stuck in Hermitage while trying to get to Francois (or vice versa), you may be able to catch a lift on the Pinnacle Tours boat with captain Charlie Courtney (based in Francois) if you ask at the General Store near the fish plant in Hermitage.\n\nThe ferry rides in Souther Newfoundland are very reasonably priced, ranging from a couple dollars for students and seniors up to five or six dollars for adults on the longer rides. The crew are friendly, and many of the ferries are equipped with a vending machine and TV\/VCR with a few old videos. The ferries occasionally go quite a ways out to sea when traveling between towns, and offer great views of the coastline.\n\nThe majority of the ferries are large enough that there isn't too much rocking, but if you are prone to getting sea-sick, then the only one that won't give you trouble is the ferry between Burgeo and Ramea, as it is the largest of the bunch. It can accommodate vehicles, and usually makes the trip several times a day.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Newfoundland and Labrador"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["no Wikipedia link"]]}]
