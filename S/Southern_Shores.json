[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Southern Shores"]}," is a town in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Outer Banks"]]}," of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["North Carolina"]]},". From the beautiful oceanfront to the sound, Southern Shores has been the best kept secret on the Outer Banks since 1947. The beaches are private and uncrowded. A community soundside bathing beach and playground are great for families with small children. And while it is a residential area, Southern Shores is just minutes from shops, restaurants, and area attractions.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nFrom the North come in on US 158\/168. Turn North on Rt. 12. From the West use US-64 and 264 to Rt 12 North. Southern Shores is a 4 mile stretch of land between Kitty Hawk and Duck. Mostly residential, it is a favorite vacation spot for many families that want to get away from it all.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nAs far as locations, Southern Shores is a nice place.  It is right across the Wright Memorial bridge (the main bridge to the Outer Banks from the north) so once you get across the bridge you're pretty much \"there\" if you've rented a house in Southern Shores.  You'll see what I mean if you've rented a house in Corolla or Avon.  Also, the beaches are less crowded (not that OBX beaches are ever very crowded, that's one of the beauties of the place) as the density of housing is not as high as other areas on the island.\n\nIf you are staying in Southern Shores, you might want to think first before you go out in a car on Saturday or Sunday during the summer.  Route 12 (which goes north to Duck and Corolla) is packed with families leaving who have just ended their week of vacation and new families coming in.  It's not impossible but can get quite busy.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nSouthern Shores does not have many restaurants as it is an area that is mostly residential, but there are great places nearby.
