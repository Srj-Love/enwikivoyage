There are a number of cafes in Jinghong where you can meet up with guides who will take you on treks to see old Dai and Bulan villages in Southern Yunnan. Cost varies, but plan on about ¥300 per person for a four day trek. \n\nThe treks are pretty easy, since you will be staying in villager's homes every night along the trail. There's no need to camp, and the terrain you'll be hiking over is hilly, but not mountainous. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Yunnan"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["no Wikipedia link"]]}]
