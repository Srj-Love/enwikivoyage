The are two centers. On one hand there's the center on the top of the old town where you can enjoy magnificent views over the bay. The old town is closed to traffic. The other center is along the beach.\n\nIt is fairly easy to drive around Sperlonga. It is often hard to park around Sperlonga in the peak season.  At other times, there are many parking lots near the old town.\n\nThere is a bus service within Sperlonga.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nSperlonga was built as a medieval fortress on a hill overlooking the Gulf of Gaeta.  It is very picturesque, with narrow paved streets, many made up mostly of steps, and houses nearby with bridges connecting them.  The town has been more than once attacked and taken by moorish pirates, most famously by Khayr al-Din (Barbarossa) in 1534.\n\nThe two beaches on the two sides of the old town of Sperlonga are  quite popular.  One beach stretches all the way to Terracina, 18km away.  The other beach ends at a cave known as the \"Grotta di Tiberio\", \"Grotto of Tiberius\" or \"Cave of Tiberius\".  The emperor Tiberius was known to have a villa in the area.  The cave has yielded a number of marble sculptures which are housed in the museum that is along the via Flacca not far from the cave, a little South of the town.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nThe main draw of Sperlonga is the beach.  The beaches are good for swimming, and in summer the sea is generally calm.\n\nSperlonga is nice to visit, though there are few specific landmarks ---- the town itself is the landmark.\n\nNightlife is available in Sperlonga, including hanging out on the main square of the old town and the road leading to it, a good selection of restaurants, and a selection of night clubs.\n\nThe archeological museum of Sperlonga can be found along the Via Flacca, south of town. It sits on a villa built by Emperor Tiberius. It houses several sculptures and artifacts from the villa. The ticket for the museum includes entrance to the Grotto di Tiberius or Cave of Tiberius.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nAlong the via Flacca it is possible to find shacks selling \"Mozzarella di Bufala\", traditional Mozzarella cheese made with Water Buffalo milk.  The water buffalos are traditional in the area north of Terracina, the former Pontine swamps, as well as in the surroundings of Fondi, which used to be swampy.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nMany restaurants in Sperlonga serve seafood, as well as other foods including pizza (being relatively close to Naples, the pizza is fairly authentic). Most of the restaurants are situated either in the center of the old town or along the street next to the beach.\n\nSperlonga also benefits from being near the agricultural area centered around Fondi, so many local fruits and vegetables are very fresh.  There is usually a farmers' market in the main square of the old town.\n\nDa Filippo, in the lower town (near the beginning of the old town), makes ice creams and other pastries.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Youth Hostel Marina degli Ulivi"],["url=http:\/\/www.marinadegliulivi.com"],["email="],["address=Via Fiorelle"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=Near the northern end of the town.

On most of the cliffs it is still possible to find remains of the old roman via Flacca, and to follow them on foot.  One section includes a tunnel that was built by enlarging a cave, and which is only accessible on foot.  This road also leads to many small beaches, often with a restaurant or other facility.
