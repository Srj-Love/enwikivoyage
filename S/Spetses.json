It is extremely popular with Athenians, who swarm the place during Easter and summer weekends. Due to the nature of available accommodation, package tourism has not caught on much.

Other land transportation includes four taxis and several horse-drawn buggies (high season only).

The museum is housed in the 17th century mansion of the 1821 War of Independence heroine, Laskarina Bouboulina and mainly exhibits artefacts from that period.\n\nOther interesting attractions include the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mansion of Sotirios Anargyros"]},", an early 20th Century neoclassical building, home of the local benefactor Sotirios Anargyros (1849–1929), just behind the waterfront cafeterias in Spetses Town.\n\nTo the north of town are the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Poseidonion Hotel"]}," and the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Daskalakis Electricity Factory"]},". The Poseidonion was cosntructed in the early 20th Century and attracted the rich and famous of Athens in its heyday, but has fallen into disrepair as of late.

The show includes an attack on the Turkish flagship with a Greek fire-boat, which sets off a fascinating show of fireworks in the harbour of Spetses Town. The week-long celebrations culminate on the second weekend of September each year, and also include concerts and other cultural events. A special mass is held in the church of Panaghia Armata in the Old Harbour, as well as at Aghios Nikolaos, the metropolis of the island.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Easter"]}," is also a very popular time for visiting the island. Holy Week traditions are lovingly passed on from generation to generation, with the highlights being the Good Friday mass, where funeral processions from all parishes converge on Spetses Town for a final open-air mass, and the Saturday midnight celebrations of the Resurrection with fireworks (before everyone returns home for the traditional feast that marks end of a 40-day fast).\n\nAccommodation during the Easter and Armata weekends can be impossible to find, unless booked well in advance.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Spetses5 evlahos.jpg"],["thumb"],["Spetses at night"]]},"\nA walk to the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Old Harbor"]}," is considered a must for visitors to the island. The coastal road is closed to vehicles in the evenings during summer season, making it a pleasant outing all the way from Spetses Town, past some of the most spectacular mansions, and on to the marina with all the luxury yachts and cruisers of the wealthier holidaying Athenians, all the way to the little churche of the Panaghia Armata and the Lighhouse--one of the first to be built in Greece, in 1837, and still in use. At a leisurely pace the walk from the new Dapia harbor at the town center to the Old Harbor shouldn't take more half an hour each way.

A bus and tourist boats run daily from Spetses Town during the summer season. An acceptable, if somewhat touristy, self-service restaurant operates in-season at Aghioi Anargyroi. The Bekiris Cave at Aghioi Anargyroi, complete with its own sandy beach, is a must-see. Access is overland from the northern edge of the Aghioi Anargyroi beach, or else you can swim inside through a very low opening. The cave served as a hideout for women and children during Turkish attacks on the island.\n\nThe very picturesque ",{"type":"'''","value":["Zogeria Beach"]},", on the north edge of the island, is also served by tourist boats from the island and boasts a restaurant, serving its specialty of chicken in tomato sauce with spaghetti or chips.\n\nOther beaches on the island, such as ",{"type":"'''","value":["Xylokeriza"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ligoneri"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Vrellos"]}," are only accessible by private transport (motorbikes or bicycles) or with very expensive sea taxis.\n\nThe town beach at ",{"type":"'''","value":["Aghios Mamas"]}," is rather dirty and crowded, but could suffice in a pinch. It's better to continue south to the tiny beach beneath Aghios Nikolaos, or even further to Aghia Marina.\n\nThere are also series of beaches beginning past the Spetses Hotel about a twenty minute walk along the main island road west of the main Dapia harbor, of which the most pleasant is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Kaiki Beach"]}," (so called from the beached hulk marking it) across from Anargyrios College (hence also called ",{"type":"'''","value":["College Beach."]},")  This beach is typically developed:  a bar, a (rather basic) rest room, a little changing shack, and sun beds under Polynesian style umbrellas for rent.  Right next to it is a public beach with fewer facilities, but the water isn't there isn't as good for swimming and that part of the beach tends to be littered.  The water at all the beaches on this northern stretch of the island can be too rough for pleasant swimming when the wind is up.\n\nOther interesting sights to visit:\n",{"type":"*","value":["The fortified former monastery of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Aghios Nikolaos"]},", now the Metropolis of Spetses.

There are several large hotels and also rent-room places right in or near the main Dapia harbor, which is convenient but can be noisy.

About an equal distance from Dapia the other direction are a number of hotels and studios, most notable of which is the Hotel Spetses:  this area is not particularly atmospheric away from the shore, but it is relatively quiet, and is located conveniently to Kaiki Beach and to the Patralis restaurant and to a number of other pleasant restaurants and cafes.\n\nPlenty of hotels cater to visitors on the island, but rooms tend to be tiny, prices high and service mediocre.
