So wear appropriate clothes. Rain-wear would be useful, as would walking or sports shoes, and a pair of trousers. \n\nThe tours are run by volunteers and facilities are very basic. The visit includes a descent in the mines, by means of a vertical ladder which is 8 meters high. If you are uncomfortable with an unassisted climb of 8 meters or are claustrophobic then a visit would need extra consideration. However the welcome is very warm and you will receive a more thorough experience than at many other tourist sites.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mons"]]}," is the nearest place that has hotels.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Spiennes"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["50.425225"],["3.988981"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Hainaut"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Spiennes"]]}]
