It was the political, administrative, economic and cultural centre of Szepes (Spiš) County of the Kingdom of Hungary. Before 1464, it was owned by the kings of Hungary, afterwards (until 1528) by the Zápolya family, the Thurzó family (1531–1635), the Csáky family (1638–1945), аnd (since 1945) by the state of Slovakia.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Szepescivertanlegi4.jpg"],["thumb"],["right"],["Aerial view of the Castle"]]},"Originally there was just a Romanesque stone castle with fortifications. A two-story Romanesque palace and a three nave Romanesque-Gothic basilica were constructed by the second half of the 13th century. A second settlement was built beyond the castle walls in the 14th century, by which the castle area was doubled. The castle was completely rebuilt in the 15th century; the castle walls were heightened and a third extramural settlement was constructed. A late Gothic chapel was added around 1470. The Zápolya clan carried out late Gothic transformations, which made the upper castle into a comfortable family residence, typical of late Renaissance residences of the region of the 16th and 17th centuries. The last owners of the Spiš Castle, the Csáky family, abandoned the castle in the early 18th century because they considered it too uncomfortable to live in.
