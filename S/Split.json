Many famous Croatian sports people were born in Split, so locals often nicknamed their city ",{"type":"''","value":["\"The sportiest city in the world\""]},". The most popular sport institution is the football club Hajduk. Large portions of the city are painted with the club's colors and logo. This is done by Torcida, the oldest supporters group in Europe, established in 1950.\nBesides the bell tower of St. Duje, the symbols of city are the Dalmatian dog and a donkey. Locals have a high regard for the donkey because of its past indispensable place in field work and transport across the Dalmatian mountains.\n\nWinters in Split are generally mild, with temperatures above 0°C, but despite the popular saying that the city experiences snowfall once every 30 years, there is actually at least one snowy day nearly every winter, usually in January or early February. If you find yourself in Split on a day with significant snowfall, expect serious traffic disruption.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Split Airport"]}," (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["SPU"]]},") ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.split-airport.hr\/index.php?lang=en"]}," is, after Zagreb Airport, the most important in Croatia. Scheduled services fly to major European cities, with summer charter flights from more. The airport is about 25 km west from Split, near the city of Trogir. It has free WiFi internet. Airport buses run from the terminal to the city and stop at the eastern end of 'Riva'. A single ticket costs 30 kn. Local buses run from the road outside the terminal -- walk through the parking lot and go to the bus stop on the other side of the road.\n\nBus number 37 runs about every 30 min and costs 16 kn (tickets are bought from the bus driver). Bus 37 does not take you all the way to the historical centre and you need to switch to bus 9 or 10, or just walk about a kilometre along the major road that runs by the bus stop (stops for buses 9 and 10 are also by this road). In addition, a small fraction of the departures from Split main bus station to Trogir on work days use the road next to the airport. In the on-line timetables ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ak-split.hr\/EN\/vozni.red\/index.html"]}," search for ZRAČNA L.-AIRPORT (but take into account that the timetable is not necessarily 100% correct).

If you ask locals for directions they will automatically point you towards this bus, but beware if you are travelling with another airline then this bus schedule is a bit irrelevant.  A single ticket costs 30 kn (about €4).  As of April 2010, it appears as if the shuttle bus meets all scheduled arriving flights even those not from Croatia Airlines.  When exiting the terminal go to your right and you should see the buses.\n\nTaxis will also take you into town. A taxi to Split centre (ferry port or Diocletian's Palace) takes a bit over 30 min and costs about 270 kn on the meter, though most drivers will agree on 220 if asked in advance. If your transferring to a ferry tell the driver the ferry departure time so he can rush if necessary.\n\nIf leaving Split by plane, be careful to plan the journey to the airport in advance, as local buses don't run before 5AM or after midnight.\n\nFlights to and from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Belgrade"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Serbia"]]}," were reintroduced in June 2012 after a 21-year hiatus.
