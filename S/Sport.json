So hunting them down will quite often lead to exciting adventures in lesser known locations.\n\nOne object of the game is to carry treasure from one cache to the next. Some of the treasures have identification information, so their travels can be tracked on-line.  To play the game you will need a GPS receiver (or a map and the orienteering skills to use it), the cache description (make a printout) and about 1 hour spare (more for a difficult cache).\n\nRelated to geocaching is the Degree Confluence Project where people contribute photographs of the planet at points of intersection of lines of longitude and latitude.
