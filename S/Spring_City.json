Originally settled by James Allred from Manti, the place was known as Canal Creek.  With the outbreak of the Wakara War hostilities in July 1853, Hambleton settlers on Pleasant Creek retreated to the Allred Settlement and pleas for reinforcements brought 50 Danish families via Salt Lake.  The village was sacked, and settlers removed to Manti and soon helped establish Fort Ephraim.  \n\nLittle Denmark was resettled in 1859.  The Blackhawk War caused further disruptions in the 1860’s when the place became known as Spring Town.  The abundant and quality springs in town account for the name.  The city is one of two towns in the United States on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nTo get to Spring City from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Salt Lake City"]]},", head south on I-15 and take Exit 261 at ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Spanish Fork (Utah)"],["Spanish Fork"]]},".
