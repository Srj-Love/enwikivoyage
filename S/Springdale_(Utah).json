The last stop is within easy walking distance of the Park Entrance and the Zion Visitor Center.\n\nIn spring and fall, the shuttle runs from 6:30 AM until 10:15 PM, with 10-15 minute frequency. In the summer (mid-May to early September), the shuttle runs from 5:30 AM until 11:15 PM, with 10-15 minute frequency, and 20 or 30 minute frequency in the very early morning and late evening.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["mapframe"],["zoom=auto"],["height=400"],["width=350"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":["  ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Zion Canyon Giant Screen Theater"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.zioncanyontheatre.com\/"],["email="],["address=145 Zion Park Blvd"],["lat=37.1988"],["long=-112.9898"],["directions=just outside the park entrance"],["phone =+1 435 772-2400"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=A giant IMAX theater showing the film \"Zion Canyon: Treasure of the Gods\" at 3PM and 5PM Tu-Sa.
