It is also the home of the I-95\/I-395\/I-495 junction which makes trips to DC, Tysons Corner and Alexandria very easy from Springfield.\n\nThe Franconia-Springfield metro station has a large park-and-ride parking facility, which is free on the weekends. This makes it an ideal location to park for a weekend visit to Washington DC. On weekdays a SmartTrip card (Metro's fare card) must be presented to leave the facility.\n\nSpringfield is a car-oriented suburban city, and many of the distances between attractions may be too great to walk. Additionally, walking paths in the built-up areas may not be the most beautiful, but a day trip walking around Lake Accotink will help clear out the concrete blahs.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n- Explore some of the otherwise run-down looking strip malls for awesome finds in Asian and middle-eastern foods and other goods.
