Spanish explorer,  Juan Ponce de Leon, claimed the land now known as Florida in the name of Spain on March 27, 1513. Originally the land was named La Florida, which means \"Land of Flowers.\"  The city was founded by Spanish explorer Pedro Menendez de Aviles in 1565.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nSt. Augustine has a humid subtropical climate, with mild weather during winters and hot weather during summers. High temperatures average 64 to 91 °F (18-33 °C) throughout the year. High heat indices are not uncommon for the summer months in the St. Augustine area. High temperatures can reach mid to high 90s with heat index ranges of 105-115 °F. It is common for daily thunderstorms to erupt during a standard summer afternoon. These are caused by the heating of the land and water, combined with extremely high humidity.\n\nDuring winter, the area can experience hard freezes during the night. Such cold weather is usually short lived, as the city averages only 15 nights below freezing. Even rarer in St. Augustine than freezing temperatures is snow. When snow does fall, it usually melts before touching the ground, or upon making contact with the ground. Most residents of St. Augustine can remember accumulated snow on only one occasion—a thin ground cover that occurred a few days before Christmas of 1989.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Forecast"],["Saint Augustine"],["29.88"],["-81.33"]]},"\nSt. Augustine has suffered less damage from hurricanes than most other east coast cities. The city has only received one direct hit from a hurricane since 1871, although St. Augustine has experienced hurricane or near-hurricane conditions more than a dozen times due to storms passing through the state from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic Ocean, or passing to the north or south in the Atlantic and brushing the area. The strongest effect on St. Augustine was from Hurricane Dora in 1964, the only recorded storm to hit the First Coast with sustained hurricane force winds. \n\nRainfall averages around 50 inches a year, with the wettest months being June through September.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nGreyhound ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.greyhound.com"]}," has a limited bus stop here located at: 1711 Dobbs Road\nSt Augustine, FL 32084-6202\n(904) 829-6401, Tickets are not available for purchase from this terminal.
