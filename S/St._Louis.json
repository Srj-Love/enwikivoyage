St. Louis planners have created an aesthetically beautiful city with green space at the street level. It is said that St. Louis is second only to Washington, D.C. in the number of free activities available in an American city. The Gateway Arch, the world's tallest man-made monument, forms a triumphant city skyline. An open mall surrounded by reflecting pools leads up to the historic court house, the site of the Dred Scott decision, facing the Gateway Arch.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThe city is named after King Louis IX of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["France"]]},". St. Louis is known by the nickname of ",{"type":"''","value":["The Gateway to the West"]},". The city was the last major stop before pioneers journeyed Westward to the Pacific coast. The city also played a large part during the steamboat era due its position at the confluence of the Mississippi River and the Missouri River. St. Louis was acquired from France by the United States during President Thomas Jefferson's term in 1803 as part of the Louisiana Purchase. The transfer of power from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Spain"]]}," was made official in a ceremony called, \"Three Flags Day.\" On March 8, 1804, the Spanish flag was lowered and the French one raised. On March 10, the French flag was replaced by that of the USA. In 1904, St. Louis hosted that year's ",{"type":"[[","value":[["World's Fair"]]}," and the Summer Olympic Games. Many of the parks, buildings, and finer homes in St. Louis were built around this time period. While there are few, if any, living residents who attended the Fair, it holds an important place in the modern development of the city.\n\nBefore ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Detroit"]]}," became America's automotive capital, St. Louis was the largest producer of American automobiles in the early part of the 20th century. Midtown and Downtown still have many of the original warehouses and factories standing, but most have been converted to other purposes, such as loft apartments, shops and restaurants. St. Louis was also home to a bustling fashion manufacturing industry in the early 1900s, centered on Washington Avenue downtown. As with the auto industry, the last remnants of the fashion manufacturing industry can be found in the recently rehabbed warehouses which now contain new businesses and loft condominiums.  In the late 20th century, St. Louis began a transformation from a manufacturing and industrial economy into a globally known center for research in Medicine, Biotechnology, and other sciences. Firms such as Monsanto, Centene, Solae, Energizer, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, Edward Jones, Wells Fargo Advisors (formerly A.G. Edwards), Anheuser-Busch\/Inbev are headquartered in St. Louis. AT&T and Bank of America operate major regional offices here. Two major private research universities, Washington University in St. Louis and Saint Louis University, are an important part of the local economy and society.\n\nSt. Louis is truly a city of neighborhoods, each with its own distinct flavor and culture. There are 79 government-designated neighborhoods within the City of St. Louis, many of which have associations and councils that exercise wide control over development and subsidies from the highest to the very lowest local level. Some neighborhoods contain avenues of massive stone mansions built as palaces for heads of state visiting the 1904 World's Fair, and now occupied by some of the more wealthy families and individuals in the City of St. Louis. Other neighborhoods are predominantly middle class and working-class and have retained their singular cultural identity for 200 years. Today, most of them have endured as strong and cohesive communities for their residents.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Forecast"],["St. Louis"],["38.64"],["-90.23"]]},"\nWith neither mountains nor large bodies of water nearby to moderate the climate, St. Louis experiences extremes of temperatures at both ends of the scale.

July and August are hottest and most humid, and January and February are cold, with occasional snow. Normal temperatures range from 21°F in the winter to 90°F in the summer (-6°C to 32°C), but summer highs of 100°F and winter lows of 0°F are not uncommon (38°C and -18°C).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nSt. Louis can be accessed by ",{"type":"'''","value":["Interstate 70 West"]}," from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Illinois"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Indiana"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ohio"]]},", and points eastward, ",{"type":"'''","value":["I-64W"]}," from Illinois, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kentucky"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tennessee"]]},", and points southeastward, ",{"type":"'''","value":["I-55N"]}," from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Arkansas"]]},", Tennessee, and points southward, ",{"type":"'''","value":["I-55S"]}," from Illinois, ",{"type":"'''","value":["I-44E"]}," from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tulsa"]]},", and ",{"type":"'''","value":["I-70E"]}," from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kansas City (Missouri)"],["Kansas City"]]},".

Schlfaly is the largest microbrewery in St. Louis but not the only one.  4Hands, Civil Life, Urban Chestnut, Square One, Perennial Artisan Ales, are just a few of the other breweries in town.  They are definitely worth a look.\n\nIf you are would rather explore rather than choose one specific establishment, two areas in St. Louis are great for wandering from location to location: The Central West End (featuring Sub-Zero Vodka Bar, the Drunken Fish, Tom's Bar, the Loading Zone, Mandarin Lounge, and Bissinger's Chocolate Lounge all off Euclid Ave), and Downtown centered around Washington Ave (featuring Kyo, Home, Pepper Lounge, Lucas Park Grille, Plush, Nectar, and rue13). St. Louis's MetroLink system is great if you prefer not to drive, but much of the line will stop running by 1AM.\n\nSt. Louis is also home to a number of gay and lesbian friendly nightlife options. From busy bars to energetic dance clubs, make sure to stop by rBar, Atomic Cowboy, Novak's, and the Complex. Much of these are on Manchester Rd in Forest Park Southeast.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["drink"],["name=The Big Bang"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.thebigbangbar.com\/"],["email="],["address=807 N.

Areas most often visited by tourists are no more dangerous than any other large American city. The more popular and most-visited areas in the city, such as Clayton, Downtown, the Central West End, and Forest Park have very low crime rates, even for the Midwest.\n\nSome economically depressed North County suburbs like Wellston, Pagedale and parts of Normandy and Jennings, as well as many parts of North Saint Louis city are unsafe. The post-war exodus to the suburbs has taken a huge economic toll on these areas, leaving many buildings abandoned, decaying, or demolished. East St. Louis, in Illinois, is also noted for its high crime rate (note this is not true of Alton or Belleville, in Illinois to the north and south). When in the city, a general guideline (though politically incorrect and somewhat simplistic) is that areas north of Delmar Blvd are less safe than south. Most tourists, however, will have little reason to visit any of these places, so it should not present reason for much concern.\n\nSome Metrolink stations are located in areas some may find questionable after dark as well. But most downtown areas around Busch Stadium, and Union Station, as well as the St. Louis University area and commuter lots near the airport, are generally safe and patrolled.\n\nAlthough the chance is extremely rare, an earthquake is possible in the area, as St. Louis sits on a fault line, whose last big earthquake changed the course of the Mississippi River. While many scientists have cautioned that a \"big one\" may occur again, the majority agree it is unlikely to happen any time soon.\n\nSt. Louis has had more urban tornadoes than any other city in the country, so make sure you understand tornado safety precautions.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Cope"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Consulates"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["Belgium"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Belgium (Honorary)"],["url=http:\/\/www.diplobel.us\/Representatives\/Find_Consul.asp"],["email=SaintLouis@diplobel.org"],["address=3466 Bridgeland Dr Ste 211, Bridgeton"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 314 770-2900"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["Germany"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Germany (Honorary)"],["url=http:\/\/www.germany.info\/Vertretung\/usa\/en\/04__Legal\/01__Consulate__Finder\/HC\/02__ABC\/Hecker.html"],["email=lansing@ix.netcom.com"],["address=330 Wenneker Dr"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 314 567-4601"],["tollfree="],["fax=+1 314 567-1101"],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["Italy"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Italy (Honorary)"],["url=http:\/\/www.ambwashingtondc.esteri.it\/Ambasciata_Washington\/Menu\/Informazioni_e_servizi\/La_rete_consolare\/"],["email=jcola@sonnenschein.com"],["address=One Metropolitan Sq, 211 N Broadway Ste 3000"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 314 259-5931"],["tollfree="],["fax=+1 314 259-5985"],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["Ireland"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Ireland (Honorary)"],["url=http:\/\/www.consulateofirelandnewyork.org\/home\/index.aspx?id=40068"],["email="],["address=500 N Broadway Ste 1515"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 314 727-1000"],["tollfree="],["fax=+1 314 727-2960"],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["flag"],["Netherlands"]]}," ",{"type":"{{","value":[["listing"],["name=Netherlands (Honorary)"],["url=http:\/\/sanfrancisco.the-netherlands.org\/Config\/Right_column\/Other_representations_in_the_U_S\/Honorary_Consulates"],["email=info@nedcons.com"],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=+1 314 965-3533"],["tollfree="],["fax=+1 314 965-3533"],["hours="],["price="],["content="]]}]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site"],["Cahokia Mounds"]]}," - located just across the river in Illinois, this is the site of the largest pre-Columbian city north of Mexico and has been designated an official ",{"type":"[[","value":[["UNESCO World Heritage site"]]},"."]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Alton (Illinois)"],["Alton"]]}," is a historic river town just across the Mississippi River from St. Louis.
