The town centre is usually reasonably safe but avoid groups of young people, particularly if you are gay, non-white or if you dress unconventionally. Particular caution should be taken in the deprived Parr and Hardshaw areas to the northeast of the town centre, but St Helens is demographically very mixed and there are housing estates and areas across the borough that it would be wise to avoid unless escorted by a local. Areas which are experiencing rising crime rates in the town and borough include Clock Face, Rainhill, Sutton and Thatto Heath and therefore non-locals should exercise caution in these districts.\n\nIn the winter, when the sun sets earlier, the centre of town can be less friendly. There is a small gap between shops closing and bars becoming populated where the town is overrun with disrespectful youths or beggars. Nighttime is fairly safe as long as you take care of yourself and those you're out with. Police are often patrolling or monitoring the streets but are enormously overstretched and often very slow to respond to calls for help. Fights are usually alcohol-fuelled and around pub closing time but can be avoided with a little tact or swift feet. Taxi ranks, take-aways, bus stops and Bridge Street are best avoided after the pubs close.
