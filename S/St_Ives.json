St Ives is a lovely Cornish village that has grown into a town. In the centre are quaint cottages, small alleys, craft and gift shops - often original, especially the paintings due to the influx earlier this century of artists from around Europe.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nTrains from London Paddington to Penzance normally stop at St Erth one stop before Penzance.  From St Erth take the St Ives branch line train (they normally connect with London trains), a bus or a taxi.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nTrying to drive through the narrow streets of St Ives is a bit of a nightmare; go on foot like everyone else. This only applies to streets in the town's harbour, while the rest of the town has regular roads. Driving through the harbour during holiday months can be slow due to the massive volume of tourists that swarm the town.\n\nThere are numerous car parks in St Ives (£3-5 for the day), but the ones closest the town fill up quick in summer during the day.  There is a large car park at the top of the town next to the leisure centre, a 10 minute walk from the harbour.  It normally has spaces on all but the busiest days. There is also a Park and Ride Scheme, you park at one of the station on the St Ives branch line (e.g. Lelant, Lelant Saltings, etc.) and get the train in to the town.  Follow the signs. Note that there was a car park outside of the leisure centre but this was built on a cliff face that is dangerously unstable. The local government made several demands for it to be closed as it was illegally established in the first place. When this was ignored, they shut it down themselves and blockaded the car park with concrete barriers. Any visitors who were used to using this car park will have to find somewhere else. Also note that parking in front of a resident's driveway is a very bad idea. You will often be shouted at and if you do not heed these words, you may return to find your tyres slashed.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Barbara Hepworth Museum and Sculpture Garden"]},"showcases the work of one of the 20th Century’s most important sculptors.
