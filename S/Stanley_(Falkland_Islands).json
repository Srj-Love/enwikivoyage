The rough waters and intense storms found at the tip of the continent forced many ships to Stanley Harbour, and the ship repair industry helped to drive the island economy.  Later, support for the Antarctic sealing and whaling boats became a major industry.  Today, the vast majority of the town's residents are employed by the government, with tourism also being a major source of employment; on days when two or more large cruise ships dock in the town tourists may outnumber the local residents.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nArrivals to Stanley either come by boat or from the airport.  Most large cruise ships will dock near the centre of town and allow passengers time to roam the city and possibly take trips by vehicle to nearby wildlife sites.  When arriving by air, passengers will come in from Mount Pleasant airport, which is located 56 km from town.  Taxis and a shuttle bus can drop passengers off anywhere within the town.  The smaller airport located just outside of town is used for domestic flights, although it is possible to land on an international flight at Mount Pleasant airport and then take a domestic flight to Stanley.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By foot"]},"\n\nStanley is a small town, so walking is probably the best option for seeing the sights.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By taxi"]},"\n\nThere are two taxi services operating within Stanley that service the town and the surrounding area.\n",{"type":"*","value":["Bonners Taxis, Tel: 51126"]},{"type":"*","value":["Town Taxis, Tel: 52900"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=The Falkland Islands Museum"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Extensive information about the 1982 conflict, as well as history of the Falklands and some exhibits on Falkland Islands flora & fauna."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Christ Church Cathedral"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=This cathedral is the southernmost cathedral in the world.
