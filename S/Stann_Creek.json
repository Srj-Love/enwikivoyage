The Garifuna people of Belize is a culture that is disappearing. The Garifuna are direct descendants of a group of African slaves who escaped two ship-wrecked Spanish slave ships near St. Vincent in 1635. They celebrate a diverse and rich culture that is a blend of African traditions of music, dance and religious ceremonies; Native American farming, hunting, and fishing techniques; and a French and Arawak influenced language.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlineregion"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["16.9667"],["-88.2167"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Belize"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["it:Stann Creek"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Stann Creek"]]}]
