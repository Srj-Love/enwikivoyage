Then the city was called Augusta Traiana and it was one of the most prominent cities in the Roman Province of Thrace. Huge avenues, covered with marble slabs, lined with statues, and a large amount of archaeological artifacts remain from this period, including the Roman Walls and Gate of the city, mosaics and the Roman Forum.\n\nDuring the centuries to follow, the city was called Beroe, Irinopolis, Eski Zagra and finally – Stara Zagora (old city behind the mountain). Just before the liberation from the Ottoman Empire, the city was burned 3 times in the late 1800s and there is not too much left to see from the medieval or Bulgarian National Revival buildings. The exceptions are the few churches and monasteries within the city limits, as well as a 15th century Ottoman mosque with amazing frescoes, declared now a National Monument of Culture.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Modern life"]},"\n\nAfter its rebuilding in the end of the 19 and beginning of the 20th century, Stara Zagora became one of the few Bulgarian cities build on grid. This was also the time that the large boulevards and small streets were lined up with linden trees, giving the city the aroma of late spring perfume so enchanting in the beginning of June.\n\nStara Zagora was also called the city of “poets” since many Bulgarian poets were born, spend their lives and created amazing poetry here, in the inspiring surroundings of one of the most prominent cultural centers in Bulgaria.
