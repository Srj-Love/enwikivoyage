It gained greatly in prestige with the establishment of the Monastery of the Transfiguration in the twelfth century. Its salt works made it the regional leader in salt and brine production, driving its economy, and leading to the growth of the town to nearly 5,000 inhabitants by the fifteenth century, when it was incorporated along with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Novgorod"]]}," into the Princedom of Muscovy.\n\nOwing to its northwestern location, Staraya Russa has seen many battles. Well after its wooden walls had been burnt down and later replaced by stone fortifications, the town fought bloody battles against Swedish invaders for centuries, but the most devastating years of its history would come after the reign of Ivan the Terrible, during the Russian ",{"type":"''","value":["Time of Troubles"]}," in the early seventeenth century. Until the establishment of the Romanov Dynasty, the surrounding area was under the control of armed gangs and brigands, and the once-important city dwindled to a mere 38 people. Over time Staraya Russa recovered, but its fate as a town on the invasion route would come back to haunt it one last time in the twentieth century, when Hitler's forces invaded during WWII and virtually levelled the historic town.\n\nDespite the destruction throughout the years, though, many old wooden houses (including the Dostoevsky residence) and several important churches remain intact, and other institutions, like the balneologic resort, have been rebuilt. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the town's population is shrinking (along with the rest of rural Russia), and feels a sleepy backwater—actually, a great change of pace for travellers who have been spending most of their time in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saint Petersburg"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]},". The residential areas near the rivers are quite peaceful, the locals are friendly and laid-back, and there is a lot to see with all the Dostoevsky sights. Better still, despite the Dostoevsky connection, the place is pretty much devoid of any international travellers outside of the high tourist season in summer, so you'll have the place to yourself.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Staraya Russa map.png"],["thumb"],["451px"]]},"\n\nTransport connections to Staraya Russa are somewhat limited. The city is best visited as a side trip from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Novgorod"]]},", or as a detour\/stopover on the way from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]}," (or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Valday"]]},") to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pskov"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Novgorod"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nFrom Moscow (or Pskov) you can take the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Moscow"]]},"–",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pskov"]]}," route, although this service is generally limited to one train per day, with trains running overnight.

Even if coming from Moscow, this is a good way to avoid the hassle of limited train service and to see another incredible historical destination on the same trip. From ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Saint Petersburg"]]},", you can take one of six direct buses reaching Staraya Russa in six hours. Note that many of the buses terminate in neighbouring towns, e.g., ",{"type":"''","value":["Kholm"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["Parfino"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["Volot"]},", and will have their names specified as the main destination.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nFrom Novgorod, follow the A116 to Shimsk, then P51 to Staraya Russa (96km).\n\nFrom Moscow, follow the M9 to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rzhev"]]}," and take the turn for Selizharovo. Continue on the P87 to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ostashkov"]]},", then local roads to Demyansk, and then to Staraya Russa. Alternatively, follow the M10, pass ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Valday"]]},", and continue left along the P48 to Demyansk and Staraya Russa.

Hailing a \"cab\" is a good way to speed things up if, say, you want to get back quickly to the bus back to Novgorod. A taxi from Dostoevsky's House-Museum would run only about RUB50. From the train\/bus station, you can take buses 1, 4, 6, or 11 to the centre, but given how slow the buses run, it's probably quicker to walk.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See and Do"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Георгиевская церковь - Старая Русса.jpg"],["320px"],["thumb"],["Dostoevsky's own place of worship at Saint George's Church"]]},"\n\nIf you are spending just a half day in town, focus on the main Dostoevsky sights—above all the house museum, with a stop by St. George church and a stroll along the river—and pay the Monastery of the Transfiguration a visit. If you have a bit more time, perhaps take a tour through the Cultural Centre, and consider wandering over towards the Balneologic Resort to acquaint yourself with the very Russian\/Soviet tradition of mineral water sanitoria. If the weather is OK, Staraya Russa is also just a really nice place to walk around.

Sadly, the complex was almost completely destroyed in WWII. In the early 1980s, the government made a half-hearted attempt to erect a new metal dome over the fountain, but the salt in the air corroded the metal and quickly brought it down.
