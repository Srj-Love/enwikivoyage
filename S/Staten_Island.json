The Staten Island Expressway runs east-west, from the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to the Goethals Bridge. The West Shore expressway runs south from the Staten Island Expressway in the northwest portion of the island to the Outerbridge Crossing in Tottenville. The Martin Luther King Jr. Expressway runs north from just east of the SIE's junction with the West Shore to the Bayonne Bridge. The Korean War Veterans Expressway branches off from the West Shore Expressway just north of the Outerbridge and runs northeast all the way to Eltingville.\n\nCompared to the neatly-organized grid of Manhattan, the layout of Staten Island's streets may seem like a child's drawings. On the contrary, most streets run in a simple pattern. The biggest streets run east-west (parallel to the northern shore), north-south (parallel to the western shore), and northeast-southwest (parallel to the eastern and southern shores).

The ferry is also sometimes a faster trip from Lower Manhattan to Staten Island than a corresponding trip by car or bus.

Staten Island is no more dangerous than any of the other boroughs of New York City. However, it does have some crime.\n\nThe northern and southern portions of Staten Island are pretty different in the amount of crime and the type of crime found there.\n\nThe North Shore has a somewhat elevated crime rate compared to the rest of the Island. It is home to large low-income housing projects. This attracts a lot of both petty crime and more serious crimes. Be careful when walking alone at night.\n\nOnce you get below the Staten Island Expressway, however, the situation changes. The South Shore has a relatively low crime rate. Residents often joke about it, saying that the local burglars are nice enough to wait until you car is unlocked to rob it. In fact, burglars and pickpockets are nothing compared to the South Shore's most notorious villains - trees.\n\nNo, the trees will not come alive and attack you like in your favorite sci-fi movie. Nor will they fall on you and crush your bones. The real irritating thing about the trees is Staten Island's No. 1 mood killer, pollen. There are dozens of trees on most South Shore streets (so many you may not believe you're still in New York City). This results in the pollen count being astronomically high on spring days.
