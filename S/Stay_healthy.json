This article presents an introduction to good practices: how to live healthy, minimize risks to your health, and deal with injuries and ill health if you encounter them while you are away from home.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Before you go"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Living a healthy lifestyle"]},"\nRegardless of where you plan on traveling, you are more likely to stay healthy if you are already living a healthy lifestyle. Getting regular aerobic exercise increases your endurance, enabling you to do more walking, hiking, swimming, skiing, or other more or less strenuous activities you may want to partake in on your trip, and making it less likely that a tough climb will result in a heart attack, dizziness, or shortness of breath.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Vaccinations"]},"\n\nGet any recommended ",{"type":"'''","value":["vaccinations"]},", starting 8 weeks before travelling, especially when travelling abroad to tropical or third-world areas. If you are travelling to a particularly disease prone area, you may want to discuss immunoglobulin injections, which will make you immune to a host of diseases for several months. Consult a doctor to identify exact needs, as it depends on the case and the individual. For info about specific vaccines, see the article on ",{"type":"[[","value":[["infectious diseases"]]},".\n\nDon't wait till the last minute, as some vaccinations take weeks to produce immunity. It really could be the difference between life and death.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Medication"]},"\n\nIf you have a ",{"type":"'''","value":["pre-existing health condition"]},", consult your doctor beforehand. You may need to take special precautions when travelling.\n\nIf you use prescription medication, make sure to bring it with you, especially if it would be hard to find where you're going. If you will be away for more than the number of days remaining of the medication, talk to your pharmacist about getting an extra supply for your vacation. Also take non-prescription medication with you: some medications that are over the counter in one country require a prescription in another or are hard to find there. However, make sure that by taking such medications on your trip, you won't run afoul of local drug laws and get in trouble.  If crossing an international border, confirm in advance that you can convey your medications â€“ what's legal in your home country may not be in another.\n\nTake copies of your ",{"type":"'''","value":["prescriptions"]}," in case you lose or run out of medications or to prove the medication is for your personal use.\n\nIf you are traveling within your own country or another country that has an agreement with yours, you may be able to have a prescription temporarily transferred to a local pharmacy. Ask your pharmacist if this is possible in your case.\n\nAlso, there are some diseases that can be prevented with prophylactic medications, including ",{"type":"[[","value":[["malaria"]]},". As with vaccinations, it can take weeks for immunity to build up, so find out well in advance of your trip which medication(s) you need and when you should start taking them.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["First aid kit"]},"\nEspecially if you are going to be doing hard hiking in remote areas, make sure you bring a first aid kit with you, including a tourniquet. You don't want to be caught without in an extreme situation.\n\nTake a ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["First aid kit for travellers"],["health kit"]]}]}," of medications and first aid items. Ensure that the quantity of prescription medications and other items that may be difficult to obtain while travelling will last for the entire trip.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Condoms"]},"\nIf you might have sex on your trip, buy the condoms of your choice and take them with you. If you don't, there's a risk that you could get carried away by the moment and catch something you can never get rid of, or\/and get pregnant or get someone pregnant. Also, condoms sold in some places may be the wrong size for you or may be poorly quality-controlled and liable to break.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Travel insurance"]},"\n\nVerify what your regular or credit card ",{"type":"'''","value":["insurance"]}," will cover while away from home, and consider taking out ",{"type":"[[","value":[["travel insurance"]]}," to cover any difference.  Although travel insurance for lost luggage and delays will save some small costs or inconvenience, the cost of medical treatment or medical evacuation can be crippling if not covered by insurance.  In some countries an inability to show you are insured or can otherwise pay may lead to you being refused treatment altogether.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["During your trip"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Guarding against injuries in accidents"]},"\nWhether you are in a car or a plane, you are well-advised to use a seatbelt. This is much more crucial when you are in the front seat of a car, where in the event of a sudden stop, you risk crashing through the windshield.\n\nIf you are on any kind of bike, make sure to wear a good helmet, and if you are going somewhere where helmets are hard to find, consider bringing one from home. You do not want to have your vacation spoiled by an easily preventable brain injury.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Precautions against disease"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Water contamination"]},"\nMake sure you know whether the tap water of the places you're visiting is safe to drink. In many instances, it is not safe to use tap water even to rinse your toothbrush, unless the water is boiled. Similarly, be careful about drinks with ice. If the water is not safe to drink at room temperature, freezing it will not kill pathogens that can make you very sick. In some cities like Shanghai, there are restaurants that use reverse osmosis that filters out pathogens from tap water, and use that tap water to make their ice. If that's the case, the ice is safe, but when in doubt, look out!\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Food contamination"]},"\nFood poisoning can happen anywhere, but the risk is greater in hot climates where food can go bad more quickly. Be careful about food that has been or could have been left out for hours, especially in hot weather that's conducive to microbe reproduction. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Travellers' diarrhea"]]}," is particularly common when people from developed countries travel to developing ones, where sanitation standards tend to leave much to be desired.\n\nIn addition, in countries where nightsoil (human excrement) is used for fertilizer (such as China), it is dangerous to eat raw fruits or vegetables unless they have hard peel that can be discarded. Also fresh vegetables washed in possibly dirty water are a risk. In many countries, raw fruits and vegetables are usually quite safe, but if you are in doubt about the safety of raw, unpeeled fruits or vegetables anywhere, don't eat them. Also, even if you are purchasing a slice of melon, if you know whether the vendor used a dirty machete to chop it or it was cut cleanly, you can gauge the possible danger from eating it.\n\nFinally, there are diseases and parasites you can get by eating meat, poultry, or fish that has not been cooked to a sufficient temperature to kill them. This does not mean that sushi and sashimi restaurants are all unsafe to patronize, nor that the steak tartare at your local French restaurant will definitely make you ill: Part of what you need to do when patronizing an eatery is to make a judgment about how much you trust their quality control.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Pests"]},"\nIf you are going to be traveling in a region where diseases spread by mosquitoes, ticks, flies, or other vectors are endemic, make sure to take preventive measures. To avoid mosquito bites, consider using a repellent such as citronella and sleeping under a mosquito netting. To avoid tick bites, tuck your socks into your long pants, in addition.\n\nSee also the article on ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pests"]]}," for more information.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["Dangerous animals"]]}]},"\nWe have a separate article on this topic, but the watchword really is to respect animals, listen to what local people say about them, and use common sense.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Swimming and diving risks"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["see also"],["Water sport"]]},"\nSome beaches are extremely dangerous. If you ask some locals where the beach is, and they point you in its direction but tell you not to swim there because there are evil spirits in the water, don't ignore their advice. Whether you call it evil spirits or undertow, it will kill you just as dead. A word to the wise is, if you are considering swimming at a remote ocean beach with no lifeguard, make sure it is partially enclosed by a cape, because that is likely to cut off some of the riptide. Of course, it's much safer not to swim unless a lifeguard is on duty.\n\nAlso be careful in places where dangerous ",{"type":"[[","value":[["jellyfish"]]}," are endemic. Jellyfish attacks are much more frequent than shark attacks, and from some species, more likely to be fatal.\n\nThere is no reason to be paranoid about risks involved with swimming; just know what the risks are in each place you visit and make a judgment about them.\n\nIn terms of diving risks, scuba diving can easily be fatal if you are not properly trained. Fortunately, you generally cannot scuba dive unless you are properly certified, which minimizes the risks greatly.\n\nIf you would prefer to stay closer to the surface of the water, snorkeling can be a good alternative. It contains its own risks, but in many places, you can stay in shallow water, where you can swim back to shore more quickly and may even be able to stand up if you have to (though it is bad to stand on fragile coral reefs and should be avoided whenever possible).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["What to do if you get sick or injured"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["see also"],["Dealing with emergencies while travelling"]]},"\n\nIf there is a reliable emergency number for ambulances in the country you are visiting, make sure you have it memorized or take it with you. For GSM phones 112 should connect you to the local emergency number (but better safe than sorry). You can try 112 or 911 with any phone and hope they are forwarded to the right place. Your insurance company may also have a helpline.\n\nIf you are dealing with a situation that is not an emergency, but you are nevertheless really ill, don't be a hero: Get a recommendation for a good doctor (preferably one who speaks your language, but some of the content of our ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Phrasebooks"],["phrasebooks"]]}," may help you in extremis), and go and see him\/her. If you are traveling in a remote area where either there are no doctors or your situation is too serious for you to be able to travel to a doctor in your condition, find out who the reputable local traditional medical practitioner is, and see him\/her. The herbs s\/he prescribes for you could be just the thing you need.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" See also "]},"\n\nSome locations offer particular environmental hazards:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Altitude sickness"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cold weather"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sunburn and sun protection"]]}]},"\nOr other health concerns:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pests"],["Animal pests"]]}," â€“ insects, scorpions and other invertebrates (mostly) that bite, sting or spread disease"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dangerous animals"]]}," â€“ bigger animals, from snakes and dogs to hippopotamuses"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Infectious diseases"]]}," â€“ caught from insect bites, bad water, infected food, other humans or other animal species"]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Jet lag"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Poisonous plants"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["PartOfTopic"],["Travel topics"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Usabletopic"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Health care"]]}]
