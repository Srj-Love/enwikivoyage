[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Steamboat Springs"]}," is a ski resort in the state of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Colorado"]]}," in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United States of America"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nSteamboat Springs is typically 3-4 hr away from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Denver"]]}," by car in good winter conditions. If heavy snow, there are a couple of passes (including Rabbit Ears Pass) which become much more difficult and slow going. The most direct route from Denver to Steamboat is I-70 west to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Silverthorne"]]},". From there, take Highway 9 North to Kremmling where you meet up with US 40. Then drive west on US 40 over Rabbit Ears pass to Steamboat. With no traffic or snow, the drive can be as quick as 2.5 hr. \n\nThe Local Airport is only 22 miles from Steamboat (Yampa Valley Regional Airport (HDN) in Hayden, CO). Many major airlines, including United, American and Delta, provide direct service from hubs and major cities during the winter, It is only a 30 min flight from Denver on United.\n\nNumerous bus and shuttle services are available from Denver airport.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nThe City of Steamboat Springs provides free municipal bus service year round. Buses arrive approximately every 10 min in the winter and every 20 minutes in the summer. The Steamboat Springs Transit stops along every major route with service from downtown to the mountain condos and ski area. \n\nAlpine Taxi is Steamboat's taxi Service. They provide in-town taxis as well as shuttle service to and from the Yampa Valley Regional Airport (Hayden) and the Denver International Airport.\n\nStorm Mountain Express and Go Alpine also offers shuttle service to and from Hayden.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\nThe Town of Steamboat Springs is essentially separated into several areas. One is the mountain area (known simply as \"the mountain\" or \"the base area\") surrounding the base of the Steamboat Ski Area on Mt. Werner, there are multiple shops as well as dining and nightlife. The area also includes many hotels, condominiums, and rental homes. The area is relatively easy to navigate on foot, but driving can be more difficult.\n\nThe other major area is downtown, around 4 miles from the Ski Area. Downtown Steamboat is located along Lincoln Avenue (US 40) and stretches 8-10 blocks between Third Street and Eleventh Street. This is the historic area of town. Shopping, dining and nightlife are here as well. Most of Steamboat's better restaurants are located downtown, and the area is much easier to navigate in a car than the mountain area. Parking on Lincoln Avenue is limited, but there are several parking lots on the numbered side streets.\n\nWest Steamboat is west of downtown and houses more locally-oriented businesses (like hardware stores, mechanics, and specialty shops).\n\nSteamboat is long known for its legendary \"Champagne Powder\" snow, western heritage, and Olympic Tradition which gives Steamboat the name of  \"Ski Town USA.\"  Steamboat is also known for its reputation as a breeding ground for US Winter Olympic Athletes, who often participate in the Steamboat Springs Winter Sports Club that practices and trains athletes on Howelsen Hill. Howelsen Hill is Steamboat's second, smaller ski area, and is located near the downtown area.  Howelsen Hill is the oldest continuous operating ski area in Colorado.  Tickets here are much cheaper than at the Steamboat Ski Area, but terrain is also much smaller and includes one lift that operates on weekends, a pomma, a halfpipe, and several runs.\n\nNotable Steamboat sites:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Fish Creek Falls"]}," Waterfall located in the town of Steamboat Springs.
