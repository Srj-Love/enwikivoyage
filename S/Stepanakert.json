Tickets cost 4,500 drams.\n\nThe budget option to get to Stepanakert are 'marshutki' (single: 'marshutka') i.e. micro-buses which every morning go from the bus station in Yerevan, Armenia to Stepanakert.  Marshutki are not new, and they are not very comfortable, but, on the other hand, they are cheap (less than 20 USD, which you should pay in Armenian currency).  Normally, marshutki start at 6:00, 7:00, and 8:00, sometimes at 9:00 but it is the approximate departure time.  You should arrive some time (at least 20 minutes) before the departure to find a free chair.  Your luggage will be nested on the roof of the micro-bus.  \n\nDriving is also possible, the M-12 highway connects with Armenia and is the most reasonable way to reach Stepanakert. A more adventurous traveller can opt to drive through the Karvajar pass but it's longer and the roads are in a dilapidated condition. To reach the pass, follow road M-11 on the Armenian side. Both roads offers amazing views of wild life, deep forests, dramatic cliffs and several ancient monuments on the way. Few people speak anything other than Armenian so prepare yourself with a dictionary. \n\nThe visitor must possess the Nagorno-Karabakh visa.
