The town is well known for being the first ever 'new town'; new towns were a series of towns built near London after World War II. Stevenage as a whole is not as a major tourist attraction, but there are some attractions that may attract local visitors. An interesting fact about the town is that a view of Stevenage from the air, shows it as a heart shape.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nStevenage is a must for architecture and planning historians, sociologists and socialists to visit, it represents, perhaps, the most successful of the great Post-War experiments with new housing. This was a huge project to relocate those who were displaced by the war in clean, open, and healthy new towns. Its often unattractive architecture is mostly that of the 1960s and 1970s; in this it is perhaps unfortunate, but it was also conceived with a strong vision in mind.\n\nIt is easy to write Stevenage off as another soulless new town, and to make stereotypical remarks about it as a place to live, as countless unthinking and lazy commentators have done. But this is to miss what the town offers. Stevenage is like any other UK town, it has its problems and these should not be dismissed, but it also benefits from a good transport infrastructure, wide open spaces, plenty of sporting facilities, a theatre of some reputation and lovely countryside both around it, and within it.\n\nThere are many reasons why you might want to come to Stevenage to live. Swimming pools, relatively low house prices, but a quick commute to London (20 minutes by fast train), as well as tennis courts and wide open parks. All of these do attract people from the surrounding area to Stevenage. A particularly attractive feature is the network of separated bicycle paths that cross the whole area, enabling one to cycle practically anywhere in the town, without having to negotiate traffic. Stevenage has the first pedestrianised shopping precinct in the UK, which on the whole remains vibrant and successful, unlike those in many other new towns. Sadly, as with some other UK cities, this is a different place at night - its bleak, sodium-lit environment is not conducive to a thriving night time economy, which is mainly conducted in the Leisure Park by the train station, and the old town. Overall, local citizens are supportive of their town and football team (Stevenage FC), one of the most well supported football league teams in the UK.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\n\nPeople have lived in the environs of Stevenage since the Roman times, and a hoard of Roman coins was found in the mid-1980s when Chells Manor was built. One of the most 'famous' landmarks in Stevenage is the 'six hills', which were burial mounds for a wealthy Roman family. Later on, Saxons settled nearby to what is now the Great North Road, subsequently bypassed by the A1(M) motorway. The Saxons gave their new village the name 'Stigenace' or 'Stithenac', which means 'at the strong oak'. Over the following centuries, various hamlets and farmsteads sprung up around the village of Stevenage, the largest ones being Shephall and Broadwater. Stevenage was probably affected by the Danish invasions in the late 9th century as several places very close by have the name Dane End, which usually marks the edge of 'Dane-law'.\n\nStevenage became more stable during the 11th century, and the Domesday Book records the existence of Stevenage, and many nearby hamlets such as Chells, Shephall, Woolenwick, Whomerley, and Broadwater. Things progressed slowly and steadily for the following centuries, when Stevenage grew from a village to a very small and attractive market town centred around the High Street. Stevenage was frequently visited by people travelling on the Great North Road (that used to run through Stevenage), including Samuel Pepys.\n\nIn the mid 19th century the population grew to 2,100 as a result of the new railway station built in the town. During the 19th century Charles Dickens and Edward Bulwer Lytton founded the Guild of Literature and Arts on London Road, Stevenage. E.M. Forster also lived at Rooks Nest near St Nicholas Church.\n\nThe most dramatic change came in the 1946 when Stevenage became the location for the ",{"type":"'''","value":["First New-Town"]},". There were some disgruntled inhabitants of the Old Town who believed Stevenage was only their town, and that they were being swamped by the newcomers from London and Essex. In the next twenty years the population rocketed from roughly 7,000 to around 60,000.\n\nSince then a number of other large housing developments have been built, the biggest being Chells Manor, Poplars, St Nicholas, and Great Ashby. This year the town celebrates its 60th anniversary of becoming a new town.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nThe A1(M) motorway is the most common road used to get into the town and it runs along the western border of the town, although planned future development of Stevenage may breach this barrier and continue on the other side. The A1(M) stretches 409 miles from London to Edinburgh, and roughly follows the path of the famous and historic Great North Road. The other major road connecting Stevenage to the surrounding area is the A602 which connects the town to the A10 and Ware to the Southeast, and Hitchin to the Northwest.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nThere is one good sized railway station in the centre of Stevenage. The railway station is on Lytton Way in the town centre of Stevenage. The line served is the King's Cross East Coast Main Line, formerly the G.N.E.R. which is the main railway line in the UK.

Public buses also run a few times a day from nearby towns and villages (such as Hitchin, Luton, Welwyn Garden City, Hatfield, Hemel Hempstead, Dane End, Ware and Letchworth), to the Stevenage Bus Station in the centre of the town or to Lister Hospital, in the Corey's Mill district of Stevenage.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nYou can easily get around Stevenage by car, bus, foot or bike.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nIf you choose a ",{"type":"'''","value":["car"]}," to travel around Stevenage you will need to consult a good street map first, although the routes are straightforward if you are heading in to the centre of the town for shopping. One thing to watch for in Stevenage is its roundabouts, something the town is very famous for because there are far more of them than in most towns, and they are decorated with flowers most of the year. There are many reasonably priced car parks, but the main ones are the 13 council-managed car parks in the centre of town. These are: Westgate Multi-Storey (attached to an indoor shopping centre), St George's Way Multi-Storey, Marshgate, Southgate, Fairlands Way, Swingate, Daneshill, Railway North, Railway South, Danesgate, Swingate East and the Leisure Centre.

The remains were duly sealed in a coffin and placed in full view in the appointed location. In 1774 the house became the Old Castle Inn. In 1831, a new landlord Mr Bellamy, took over. His first task was to inspect the coffin. Henry, he confirmed, was still inside. A further check was made in 1906 when members of the East Hertfordshire Archaeological Society were allowed access to it. Their report shows that the coffin contained about two thirds of a human skeleton. However, during the first world war soldiers were stationed in the area. Several were reported to have plundered the coffin taking home bones as souvenirs. It was also reported that some soldiers sold on some bones to the local populous as trinkets.
