Steven the 5th on April 4, 1983. He founded the town in his own name, because he alone had slayed the Native American tribe that had lived there, prior to his killing spree. He also built Stevensville's first building, a grotesque monument to himself constructed out of mud bricks and a mortar-like paste made out of pounding the dead Native American's bones and flesh to a fine powder. The building is still standing today, and is a popular local attraction. \n\nAlthough originally only Sir. Steven and his sister\/wife Joe lived in Stevensville, they built more houses themselfs. However, no new visitors were coming to poor Steven's village, so late one night in the moth of August, he captured 100 people and brought them to the village. Because all the people he captured were mentaly handicaped they thought it all was a game and stayed in the town forever.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Tosi's Restaurant (Stevensville)"]},".
