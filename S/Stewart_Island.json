Even ten days tramping only skirts the northern third. Few people can claim to have seen anywhere near the whole of Stewart Island. There is much to see, even close to the only settlement of Oban. Come for a daytrip or stay longer, as there is a good range of accommodation. Some visitors from twenty years ago are still living here. \n\nTerrain is rugged. Stewart Island is made of granite, some of the oldest rock in New Zealand. A wide range of minerals are present, though not in commercial quantities. Tin was mined at Port Pegasus for a few years in the 1890s. There's black iron sand on some beaches, others are white with quartz or red with garnet. Most beaches are gold, sparkling in the sun. Don't bother bringing a gold pan though: it's all \"fool's gold\"! \n\nPaterson Inlet cuts the Island almost in half. This large expanse of water is popular for boat trips and recreational fishing and diving. \n\nThe climate is mild, and a trifle damp. Without rain, there wouldn't be a rainforest. The eastern lowlands are forest right to the water's edge. A canopy of kamahi is pierced by majestic rimu and miro. Lianes and lush fern growth adorn the bush interior. \n\nThe forest is a haven for bird-life, as there are fewer predators than on the mainland. Kaka, parakeets, tui, and bellbird give a wonderful dawn chorus in spring. New Zealand's national bird, the kiwi, is found all around the Island. \n\nSeabirds abound offshore. Albatross, petrels, cormorants, gulls and blue penguins are common. Rarer species like yellow-eye penguins are also seen often. \n\nMason Bay, on the Island's West Coast is much different. It's a 20 km crescent of sandy beach, with huge sand-hills and tussock and scrub in place of forest.

The birds include the South Island saddleback (tieke), yellowhead (mohua) and Stewart Island robin (toutouwai). In addition to birds the general forest health has improved significantly.
