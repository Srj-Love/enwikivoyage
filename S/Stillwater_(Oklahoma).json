The Cimarron Turnpike serves as the major thoroughfare to reach Stillwater from the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tulsa"]]}," area, and Stillwater can be reached within an hour-and-a-half using this route.\n\nThe Stillwater Airport provides air service for civil aviation planes.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nStillwater, with its relatively small size and excellent pedestrian and public transportation systems, is an extremely easy city to get around.  Oklahoma State University began operation of a small bus mass transit system in 1997 that has grown considerably and now serves all of Stillwater.  Fares are free to OSU students, faculty, and staff, and only 50¢ cents for the general public (25¢ for seniors and children).  The buses serve all of the Stillwater area, including recreational areas such as Boomer Lake.  The bus system is astoundingly well-run, and very efficient.  For more information on the bus, visit http:\/\/www.parking.okstate.edu\/RoutesAndMaps.htm \n\nStillwater is also easily navigated by car, and the city has several car rental agencies.  Highway 51 (6th Street) provides Stillwater's main crosstown East-West route, and US-177 (Perkins Rd.) serves as the main North-South route.  Both offer quick travel from one end of the city to the other.\n\nStillwater is fairly pedestrian-friendly, especially nearer to the downtown district, but lacks in handicap accessibility in the residential areas, especially near the Oklahoma State campus.  The city is small enough to be completely pedestrian accessible, however increasing sprawl is making it less and less of a viable option.  If no other personal transportation is available, the easiest way to get around is a combination of the bus system and walking.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Old Central"],["url="],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Old Central is the oldest remaining building on OSU's campus and is made of Oklahoma sandstone.
