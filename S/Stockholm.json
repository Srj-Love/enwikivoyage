They usually have vacancies during weekends and summers, and might give special offers for tourists.\n\nA Swedish, and especially Stockholm's, specialty are hotel rooms in basements with no windows. Oftentimes the very reasonably-priced rooms even at hotels of established brands fall into that category, especially the singles. Basement rooms, apart from lack of windows, are often much more limited in space and outfitted in a more austere way than the regular rooms. Swedish hotels make no secret of the fact that this room category has no window, but do make sure to read the description of your room carefully before you book to avoid unpleasant surprises.\n\nThe cheap bunks are in short supply.

For 2011 it was named as the 6th safest city in the world to live in as part of the Mercer Livability Survey. As in other cities, however, you should avoid late-night walks through deserted areas of the city or through unlit parks.\n\nStockholm has an exciting night-life. As in most countries, being overly intoxicated is not accepted in most bars and clubs, and could lead to the security staff forcibly ejecting the trouble-maker. Swedish people tend to binge-drink, and as usual, alcohol might fuel violence.\n\nMost crimes against tourists are crimes of opportunity, such as ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[[","value":[["pick-pocketing"]]},", bicycle theft, auto theft, and auto vandalism"]},". As always, do not leave valuable items in your car, and watch your bag in crowded places. Most shops and all major taxi companies accept credit and debit cards, so there is no need to carry a lot of cash. Be more aware of your belongings in crowded areas such as festivals, nightclubs, markets, airports, and public transport areas.\n\nTaxis are required to post pricing information in the rear side window but there is no price cap in Sweden. Some unscrupulous drivers have exploited this by posting ridiculously high prices in the window as required and hoping that some passengers will not take notice before it is too late. In one instance a taxi driver priced a journey to the airport at SEK 38,000, equivilent to USD 5,800 or EUR 4,500. So check the price sticker before getting into a cab, and use the major cab companies (",{"type":"'''","value":["Taxi Stockholm, Taxi Kurir"]},", ",{"type":"'''","value":["Taxi 020"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Topcab"]},") to avoid overcharging, and have a better chance of having belongings lost in the car returned to you.\n\nDuring summer, groups of street gamblers try to scam their audience on Drottninggatan and in other touristed areas. They use a variety of tricks one of them being planting a few of their own in the crowd. Don't play, you will lose.\n\nThough Sweden has an extensive welfare system, and Stockholm has fewer homeless and impoverished people than other cities of similar size, homeless people can be seen ",{"type":"[[","value":[["begging"]]}," around the city; several of them from other parts of the European Union. A responsible way to address their situation is to buy the street paper, ",{"type":"''","value":["Situation Stockholm"]},", for 50 SEK. Beggars feigning disabilities, or handing out laminated begging cards on the subway, might be associated with organized gangs, and should be ignored. Buying food or water for someone begging is also a good way of helping, without risking that your money goes in the wrong hands.\n\nStockholm is friendly to sexual minorities. Homophobic and transphobic attitudes will be met with outright hostility from many Swedes. Same-sex couples will have no trouble living openly in Stockholm, which includes holding hands or kissing in public around the city. Despite this fact, common sense should be used late at night in some areas (as in any other city).\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Respect"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" When using ",{"type":"'''","value":["escalators"]},", stand on the right and use the left side for walking up the stairs.
