While many of the islands are relatively small, two large ones, Värmdö and Vaxholm, stand out as major destinations due to their unique characteristic. This guide also includes ",{"type":"'''","value":["Saltsjöbaden"]},", an early bourgeois holiday resort and suburb, built up around 1900 with its own rail line, Saltsjöbanan.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:SvenskaHogarnaHamn.JPG"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Svenska högarna, a group of islands in the outer archipelago."]]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nFrom the Middle Ages until the end of the Cold War, the Swedish military has had troops, ships and fortifications in the archipelago, to defend Stockholm. The only major enemy attack on Stockholm was committed by Russia, in 1719 to 1721. Today, most facilities are closed down. The local population relied on subsistence fishing and farming, isolated from Stockholm's tremendous progress in the 19th century, as tourists started to colonize the area. During the 20th century, many islands were de-populated, and transformed to summer resorts, with very small population during winter. Today, most island-dwellers commute to Stockholm for work, and enjoy maritime life as a hobby.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Islands"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Värmdö"]}," (archaic spelling ",{"type":"'''","value":["Wermdö"]},") is the largest island in the archipelago, accessible by road.

Värmdö is described in depth in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nacka and Värmdö"]]}," article.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Vaxholm"]}," (archaic spelling ",{"type":"''","value":["Waxholm"]},") is a quaint, road-accessible island-town, with some shopping, and a major boat terminal.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Sandhamn"]}," is a resort island in the outer archipelago.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Grinda harbour.jpg"],["thumb"],["Grinda."]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Grinda"]}," is a small rural island, near Stockholm and Vaxholm.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Utö"]}," is an outer-archipelago idyllic island with a closed-down silver mine, and remnants from the mining industry.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Öja"]}," is an elongated island, at the southern edge of the archipelago, off ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nynäshamn"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nBuses to the northern archipelago depart from Tekniska Högskolan (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Stockholm\/Östermalm"],["Östermalm"]]},").

See ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Stockholm#Public transport"]]}," and the official public transport website: ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/sl.se\/Visitor\/Plan-your-journey\/"]},"\n\nMost of the large islands can be reached on road, at some locations through free-ride car ferries.

Other (and basically the only ones during winter) routes operate from suburban mainland jetties connected to the city centre by suburban rail and bus. Vaxholm, reached by bus 670 from ",{"type":"''","value":["T Tekniska högskolan"]},", and Stavsnäs, reached by bus 433 or 434 from T Slussen are examples of this. Also note that even during the summer, when countless services operate from the city centre it is still, generally, a lot faster to travel via a suburban jetty, not to mention a lot ",{"type":"'''","value":["cheaper"]},". This is because even though the archipelago is within the metropolitan area, local transport tickets are ",{"type":"'''","value":["not"]}," valid and tickets are paid on a distance basis. However, if you're doing multiple trips, it is also possible to buy a 5 or 30 day card (420 SEK and 750 SEK respectively), which belong to Waxholmsbolaget but are also valid on Cinderellabåtarna.\n\nDestinations in the archipelago include (but are far from limited to) Grinda, Svartsö, Finnhamn, Möja, Sandhamn, Ingmarsö, Runmarö, Nämdö and Utö. From April through september most of these can be reached either from the city centre or via suburban jetties. The islands offer a wide variety of nature, from the lush green of the inner archipelago to the bare cliffs of the more distant outposts. Some islands have restaurants, youth hostels and country stores, while others are entirely deserted islands.\n\nA good destination for a day trip is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Sandhamn"]},", which is reached either by taking a direct ferry from the city centre (this takes 5 h) or by taking the 433 or 434 bus from the centrally located T Slussen to Stavsnäs and from there a connecting ferry bound for Sandhamn or Hagede (from T Slussen this takes 90-95 min during summer and 110-115 min during winter). Both Waxholmsbolaget and Cinderellabåtarna serve both routes, but again, Cinderellabåtarna service is shut down during winter.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Utö"]}," makes another good trip and is accessible from the city centre (takes 3.5 h) or by taking suburban train from Stockholm central station to Västerhaninge, then bus 846 to Årsta brygga and then a connecting ferry (from Stockholm C this takes 90 min during summer and 1 h 45 min during winter). Both routes are served solely by Waxholmsbolaget. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nThe major shipping companies are the public-transport Waxholmsbolaget, and the private-owned Strömma.\n\nWaxholmsbolaget's regular boats depart from Strömkajen at the Grand Hotel.
