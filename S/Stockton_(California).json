One of the larger cities along I-5 through the Central Valley, it is a convenient stop and offers a variety of restaurants and accommodations for road-trippers. There are several shopping centers and movie theaters and one art museum but few major attractions.\n\nThe poem \"Casey at the Bat,\" about the losing baseball team, \"the Mudville Nine\" may be a reference to Stockton, which was referred to as Mudville in its earlier years.\n\nIt is recommended that individuals exercise some caution when on foot, especially at night. Its location on I-5 also means there is a substantial potential for drug trafficking through the city. Stockton has a bad reputation including gang violence and home to the nation's first school massacre however for the past few years, Stockton has worked very hard at improving its downtown area as well as its reputation.
