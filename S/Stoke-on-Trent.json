It shares a border with the affluent town of Newcastle-under-Lyme, and the separation is most evident at Boundary Street in Hartshill.

It is approximately 45 miles from both of these cities. It can also be reached via the A34. Those seeking the city centre by road should look for signs to \"Hanley\", once they enter Stoke-on-Trent.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By rail"]},"\nStoke-on-Trent has a small but busy mainline railway station that has frequent inter-city services to most destinations in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United Kingdom"]]},".

For example, there are often two trains to London Euston at around the same time, but one is takes much longer than the other. The same applies when the destination is Manchester Piccadilly where there three different operators. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Virgin Trains"]]}," tickets are marked 'VIRGIN ONLY' and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["CrossCountry"]]}," tickets are marked 'XC Only'.

The six original towns that federated to form the modern-day conurbation city formed in 1925 continue to have their own identity, giving it a polycentric nature. Thus, asking for directions to the \"city centre\" may be regarded with bemusement from locals.
