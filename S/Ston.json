Recessed among hills, it extends 1.5 km between the southern and northern coasts. Archaeological finds here show that Mediterranean and Balkan cultural groups were both present, and in prehistory an exchange of goods took place by land and sea. This area has attracted streams of men and merchants from the mountainous interior and the open Adriatic Sea. The Tabula Peutingeriana, the first geographical map of the Adriatic from ancient Rome, shows a fort at this locations with the name of Turris Stagni. Approaching from land, Roman walls can be seen near Zamaslina. Part of an Illyrian defensive strategy was the hill-fort at Humac, which controlled all of Malostonski Zaljev (Mali Ston bay). It was the guardfort of this small area, a desired location since ancient times due to its sheltered position and natural features of this basin that include exceptional maritime and cultural qualities (now a protected preserve).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nYou can book an excursion from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dubrovnik"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:City walls of Ston0008.jpg"],["thumb"],["A section of the old defensive wall in Ston"]]},"\nA monumental defensive system, the largest fortification and urban achievements in Europe at the time.
