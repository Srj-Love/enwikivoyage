There has been settlement in various parts of what now makes up the town for hundreds of years, particularly in the region of the bridge over the River Stour, and in Oldswinford to the south. The area became famous for its glass production in the seventeenth century after Huguenot glass makers, fleeing religious persecution in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["France"]]},", found the local clay, lime and coal to be ideally suited to glassmaking. Today there are still many glass producers in the area, as well as several museums, and the Stourbridge Canal was built into the town centre to facilitate trade. \n\nToday, alongside artisan glass makers in the Glass Quarter, the town exists as a local hub for retail and leisure.
