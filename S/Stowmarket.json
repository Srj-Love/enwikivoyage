[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Stowmarket"]}," is a small industrial market town in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Suffolk"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By Road"]},"\nLocated on the A14 approx 18 miles north west of Ipswich.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By Rail"]},"\nStowmarket is on the Norwich - London trunk route and is served by hourly London - Norwich Intercity trains, two-hourly regional London - Peterborough trains and hourly services between Cambridge and Ipswich. Journey times are as follows\nLondon - 85min\nIpswich - 10-15min\nColchester - 30min\nBury St Edmunds - 15-20min\nNorwich - 30min\nCambridge - 60min\nPeterborough - 80min.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["By Bus and Coach"]},"\nThere are regular bus services from Ipswich operated by First Eastern Counties. These run every 20â€“30 minutes and most run via Claydon and Needham Market, taking approx 50 minutes to reach Stowmarket, although some peak hour services travel via the A14 and take as little as 30 minutes. There are also hourly services to Bury St Edmunds (this takes well over an hour so it is much quicker and possibly cheaper to take the train), infrequent services to Diss and a two-hourly service to Bildeston for connections to Hadleigh and Sudbury.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nEverything in Stowmarket can be reached easily on foot, however various areas in Stowmarket can also be reached using the #87\/88 buses including Combs Ford, Chilton Hall, Cedars Park and Stowupland.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThe Museum of East Anglian Life, a large Beamish-esque open-air museum dedicated to traditional rural Suffolk life.\nThe Church of St. Peter and St. Paul - an impressive church that can be spotted from most parts of the town.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nSee a film or a show at the Regal Theatre.\nWalk through the countryside from Combs Ford to Great Finborough and John Peel's grave.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nThe town centre is divided into two sections. The area south of the Marketplace along Ipswich Street features various high-street chains including Boots, Superdrug and Argos. The northern side along Bury Street is more traditional with numerous speciality shops. The Ipswich-based East of England Co-op have quite a strong influence in the town with a Co-op travel agency and a small department store in the town centre, as well as a 'Co-op Neighbourhood Shopping Centre' in Combs Ford housing a pharmacy, a supermarket, a Godfrey's hardware store and a QS clothing store. There is also a large Asda superstore in the town-centre and a possibly larger Tesco close to the A14 at Cedars Park, which has had an effect on local trade. The historic street market still exists and takes place every Thursday and Saturday along Ipswich Street, the Marketplace and the Meadow Centre.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nStowmarket's food scene is fairly limited, although the only fast-food chain is a Wimpy and the only chain coffee shop is Costa Coffee which is located within the Tesco store on the edge of town. However, saying that there is nowhere to grab a good coffee in the town centre itself.\nThere are several (chain) pubs in the town that do good and reasonably priced pub lunches including The Oak, the Dukes Head (both on Ipswich Street) and the Magpie (Combs Ford). There are both Indian and Chinese restaurants in Stowmarket but they're at best average and rather overpriced.\nThere are several good (and cheap) fish and chip shops, the most famous of which is A.C. Cracknells in Combs Ford. However this has recently been taken over by a Turkish family who own several other chip shops and kebab shops around the town and since then the prices have gone up and the quality has gone down. The nearby Chip Inn is much better than Cracknells (in fact, it has been better since a long time before Mr Cracknell sold up) but rumours and local racism prevented people from going here.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nThere are a lot of pubs scattered around Stowmarket, most of which open daily and serve good food and beer, including local ales. Stowmarket has a strong drinking culture and most locals will know each other. The most lively pubs are the Oak and the Dukes Head in the town centre. The Magpie in Combs Ford also hosts a lot of live bands.\nAt current, there is only one nightclub in Stowmarket - Jokers in Ipswich Street. Many younger Stowmartians will head out to Ipswich, Bury St. Edmunds or Norwich for a good night out, and a Jokers crowd usually consists of a mixture of young people from the surrounding villages, and an older (i.e. above 21) crowd of Stowmartians, which when combined with poor out-dated music on a tinny PA on a sticky dancefloor causes a lot of noise and often, violence. This place is best avoided, especially on a Saturday night.\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["drink"],["name=Tall Orders"],["url="],["email="],["address=12 Bury Street"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Good coffee, tea & hot chocolate etc. Good food too-jacket potatoes, wraps, panini, sandwiches & baguettes etc + specials."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["drink"],["name=Tall Orders"],["url="],["email="],["address=12 Bury Street"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours=8.45-3.30"],["price="],["content=A great independent coffee shop\/cafe offering the usual selection of coffee, tea & hot chocolate.

Despite the fact that there is no longer a market in Needham Market, it is still a very attractive town of narrow streets, small independent shops including a hardware store, a butcher, a bakery and an antique centre, a couple of decent pubs and a fish & chip shop. Take a walk along the river Gipping past two historic mills and a large lake made from a former quarry. Needham can be reached by road from Stowmarket (parking at Needham Lake car park is not free, however parking at the railway station is) or on the half-hourly #87\/88 bus (journey time 15 minutes) which drops off outside Needham Market church on the way to Ipswich. There are hourly train services from Stowmarket on the Ipswich-Cambridge line which take only 4 minutes to cover the 3 miles from Stowmarket and are actually cheaper than the bus. Needham Station is unstaffed but tickets are sold by the conductor on the train.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["52.19"],["1.00"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Suffolk"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Stowmarket"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Europe\/United Kingdom\/England\/Suffolk\/Stowmarket\/"]]}]
