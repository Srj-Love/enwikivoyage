The trailhead for this trail is located immediately South of Henshaw Creek near the Southeast side of Buttle Lake. There is significant parking and an info board just North of the creek.  The trail rises 1200m during its six kilometers.  It is easy to follow without large switch-backs. It took a group of hikers with moderate experience about 5 hours to the edge of the ridge and 2.5 hours down."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Lodging"]},"\n\n\n\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Camping"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Backcountry"]},"\n\nAlong the Flower Ridge Trail there are isolated pads in the wooded area at the edge of the ridge, but about an hour farther on there is a barren area with approximately five pads on the edge of a cliff with an impressive panoramic view. Some large rocks have been collected near the pads to hold down tent corners as the dirt is not deep enough for stakes and there is no shelter from wind (so please don't throw them off the cliff). The sparse trees are very stunted so animals might be deterred by hanging food off the cliff.\n\nFires are not allowed in the backcountry.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinepark"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Vancouver Island"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["wikipedia:Strathcona Provincial Park"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["49.8742"],["-125.744"]]}]
