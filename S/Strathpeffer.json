[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Pagebanner default.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.strathpeffervillage.org.uk Strathpeffer"]}]}," is a village in Ross-shire in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Scotland"]]}," around 30km northwest of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Inverness"]]},".  It originated in the 19th century as a spa village and many of the original hotels are extant.\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Spa Pavilion (geograph 2546773).jpg"],["thumb"],["350px"],["Spa Pavilion"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nStrathpeffer can be reached by bus from Inverness or by train from Inverness to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dingwall"]]}," and bus from Dingwall to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Strathpeffer"]]},".  \n\nStrathpeffer used to have a railway line, a branch line of the Highland Railway Inverness to Kyle line. A weekly through train from London and daily connection from Aviemore brought travellers to Strathpeffer in its heyday as a Spa. Changes brought about by two world wars and the rising popularity of the motor car contributed to the station's closure, first to passengers in 1946 and then totally in 1951. The old station building survives and houses the Highland Museum of Childhood, as well as the Museum Coffee Shop, a Fair Trade shop and a picnic area. Other buildings of note are the Pump Room and the Spa Pavilion.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nThe surrounding countryside of forests, hills and mountains offers walks and trails and in nearby ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Contin"]]},", there is a 16km mountain-bike route.

The Pump Room houses a fascinating exhibition of Strathpeffer's spa history, as well as the Tourist Information Centre.

It explores the history of highland childhood through audio-visual displays, childhood treasures, and a fascinating doll and toy collection.  At the Old Station, there is also a coffee shop where you can eat al fresco under the station awning, a fair trade shop, and a picnic area.  There are a number of other shops in the centre of the village (known as The Square, though it is not a square!), including a pharmacy with window displays of Victorian items, gift shops and a small supermarket.\n\nStrathpeffer also has a very scenic and challenging ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.strathpeffergolf.co.uk golf course"]},". \n\nNearby Castle Leod, the home of the Earl of Cromartie, Chief of Clan Mackenzie, is open to the public several times a year.
