In the 1950s many restaurants never closed, serving interstate travellers day and night. The section of 66 between Tulsa and Oklahoma City was one of the first to be bypassed by new four-lane Interstate highways. \n\nAs the Turner Turnpike (I-44) is a toll road, Oklahoma 66 remains as a free alternate.\n\nStroud's major claim to fame was a Tangier Factory Outlet Mall which was destroyed (along with many key local employers) during a series of tornadoes on May 3rd, 1999. It was never rebuilt; the town's recovery was slow and arduous. In 2001, while local rebuilding efforts were ongoing, Pixar crews were led by Route 66 historian Michael Wallis on a five-state tour through ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Baxter Springs"]]}," (Kansas), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Peach Springs"]]}," (Arizona) and countless towns between as research which inspired the nominally-fictional ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Radiator Springs"]]}," for 2006 animated film \"Cars\". In Stroud they were inspired by Dawn Welch and her stubborn efforts to restore the 1939 fieldstone Rock Café, now listed on the US National Register of Historic Places.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2006, Stroud hosted the King Arthur Faire, an annual renaissance fair. More recently, Stroud has benefited from the growth of oil and gas industries; Service King, a manufacturer of oilfield workover rigs, is now a major local employer. Plans are underway to build the new Sac and Fox Casino on the former outlet mall site and several wineries have been established in Stroud.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nBy motorcar, Stroud is fifty miles (80km) southwest of Tulsa on Interstate 44 or Oklahoma route 66.
