[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Graduation banner.JPG"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Studying abroad"]}," is one of the ways in which a traveller can live in a particular city for an extended period. Many people choose to study in a foreign country for various reasons. The quality of education in another country may be better than in their home country, or cost-of-living or educational costs may be lower. Others choose to study in a particular country to improve their proficiency in a particular language. Often, studying abroad will expose you to a different culture in a way that would not be possible in your home country, or even by travelling to that country as a tourist.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Visas"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["see also"],["Visa"]]},"\n\nWhile you may not need a visa for short visits to certain countries as a tourist or for business, going there as an international student generally requires a longer stay than going there just as a casual tourist. In general, ",{"type":"'''","value":["staying in any foreign country for an extended period of time will require you to obtain a visa in advance"]},". Student visas generally also have different requirements and application procedures from normal tourist or business visas. In general, you will need an offer letter from the institution you wish to study at, and also show evidence of funds to support yourself for at least the first year of your course. Check with the institution, as well as the immigration department for the country you wish to study in for detailed requirements.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Things to consider"]},"\n\nMoving to a foreign country for the first time is a daunting experience for many people, and going abroad to study is no exception. Going to another country to study will need you to start making preparations many months in advance, from making the application to obtaining your visa and making final travel and accommodation arrangements, figure on the whole process taking anywhere from 3â€“10 months. These are some questions for you to research on before you make a decision:\n\nOften, ",{"type":"'''","value":["culture shock"]}," is one of the main things people experience when moving overseas for the first time. You will have to adapt to the local customs and lifestyle, and these can often be radically different from your home country. In addition, the ",{"type":"'''","value":["study environment"]}," also varies radically from country to country, and sometimes, even between different institutions in the same country. For instance, undergraduate courses in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United Kingdom"]]}," tend to be very specialised and structured, and aim to provide their students with in-depth knowledge in their chosen major. In contrast, undergraduate courses in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United States"]]}," require students to study a broad range of subjects, and aim to provide their students with knowledge in a well-rounded range of areas.\n\nIn addition, you will need to consider the ",{"type":"'''","value":["language barrier"]},". Most institutions teach in the official language(s) of the country they are in, meaning that unless you know that language well, you will have to put in more effort than the local students studying in their native language to get the same grades. Of course, this is great for those whose purpose of studying in a foreign country is to improve their proficiency in a foreign language (e.g. an ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Italy"],["Italian"]]}," studying in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong"]]}," to improve his Cantonese). However, if that is not your aim, then you should seriously consider the factors carefully, as having to learn a foreign language at the same time as having to juggle academic knowledge in your chosen major subject is often an unwelcome extra burden. Some institutions do have courses and entire programmes in a foreign language, often a lingua franca such as English, Arabic or Mandarin, or have the course literature in that language. Not knowing the local language will still be a drawback, as it will be used for much informal communication. Some institutions offer beginners' language courses for foreigners. The good news for English speakers, though, is that English has emerged as the international language of communication in science, engineering and medicine, and the vast majority of academic publications in those fields are done in English. This means that many of the more reputable institutions worldwide give postgraduate research students the option of completing their thesis in English instead of the official language of their respective countries.\n\nFinally, you will need to take into account your ",{"type":"'''","value":["school fees"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["cost of living"]},". Many governments subsidise school fees for citizens and permanent residents of their respective countries, but these subsidies are usually not available to international students, meaning that you will have to pay them in full. Sometimes, your home country's government, or a private company can cover all or part of your expenses by giving you a ",{"type":"'''","value":["scholarship"]},", but this will often mean that you have to work for your government or that company for a certain number of years after you have completed your studies. The cost of living varies considerably. It can be very cheap if you are in a small village in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["India"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Southeast Asia"]]},", but living in major cities of the developed world such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New York City"],["New York"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tokyo"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hong Kong"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Melbourne"]]}," can be really expensive indeed. Also in countries where cost of living generally is cheap, this may not be true in cities with universities. There is often affordable accommodation for students, arranged e.g. by the university or the student union. The university may be able to give advice on such matters also when you have to use the private market.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Exchange Students"]},"\n\nAnother option for those who don't want to commit, or cannot afford to spend several years abroad is to go as an exchange student for a semester or a year. The universities you can study at on exchange is generally limited to those your home university has an exchange agreement with (bilateral or via international programmes such as Erasmus). Alternatively, some universities have branches in other countries (e.g. New York University has branches in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Abu Dhabi"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai"]]},"), and students studying at the main campus are often allowed to spend some time studying at one of the overseas branches (and vice versa). The advantage of this is that you are generally not subject to international student fees if your home university is in your country of citizenship (or permanent residency).\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Working while studying"]},"\n\nIn general, most countries do not issue student visas for international students to study part time. This means that international students are generally required to be enrolled as full time students. Restrictions on employment often apply to international students as well. Some countries do not allow international students to work at all, while some countries allow international students to take up part time employment under certain conditions. For instance, the UK and Australia allow international students to work for up to 20 hours a week, while the US has an additional restriction that international students may only work on campus. Check with the immigration department of the country you plan to study in for more details.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Where to go?"]},"\nDeciding where to go is often one of biggest considerations when choosing to study overseas. Some things that influence such decisions include language, distance from home and costs. The overall quality of tuition, as well as the expertise in your subject of choice at any specific institution should of course also be researched. Here is a summary of some of the more popular countries for international students.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["English-speaking"]},"\n\nHere is a table with information for the main English-speaking destinations.\n\n",{"type":"<","value":["table",{"border":"5"},["\n    ",{"type":"<","value":["tr",["\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",[]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",["UK"]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",["USA"]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",["Canada"]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",["Australia"]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",["New Zealand"]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",["Ireland"]]},"\n    "]]},"\n    ",{"type":"<","value":["tr",["\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",["Student visas"]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk\/visas-immigration\/studying\/ UK"]}]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/travel.state.gov\/content\/visas\/english\/study-exchange.html USA"]}]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cic.gc.ca\/english\/study\/index.asp Canada"]}]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.immi.gov.au\/students\/ Australia"]}]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.immigration.govt.nz\/migrant\/stream\/study\/ NZ"]}]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.citizensinformation.ie\/categories\/travel-and-recreation\/travel-to-ireland\/visas-for-travel-to-ireland\/student_visas Ireland"]}]]},"\n    "]]},"\n    ",{"type":"<","value":["tr",["\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",["Reviews of universities"]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.timesonline.co.uk\/tol\/life_and_style\/education\/good_university_guide\/article671847.ece Times"]}]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.usnews.com\/sections\/education\/ US News"]}]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.macleans.ca\/education\/index.jsp Macleans"]}]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.australian-universities.com\/rankings\/ AEN"]}]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",[]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",[]]},"\n    "]]},"\n    ",{"type":"<","value":["tr",["\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",["TV networks"]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.bbcworld.com\/ BBC"]}]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/ CNN"]}]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/ CBC"]}]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.abc.com.au\/ ABC"]}]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/tvnz.co.nz\/ TVNZ"]}]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.rte.ie\/ RTE"]}]]},"\n    "]]},"\n    ",{"type":"<","value":["tr",["\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",["Official tourist information"]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.visitbritain.com UK"]}]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.discoveramerica.com USA"]}]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/canadainternational.gc.ca\/ Canada"]}]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.australia.com\/ Australia"]}]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.newzealand.com\/travel\/International\/ New Zealand"]}]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ireland.ie\/ Ireland"]}]]},"\n    "]]},"\n    ",{"type":"<","value":["tr",["\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",["Wikivoyage article"]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",[{"type":"[[","value":[["United Kingdom"],["UK"]]}]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",[{"type":"[[","value":[["United States of America"],["USA"]]}]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",[{"type":"[[","value":[["Canada"]]}]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",[{"type":"[[","value":[["Australia"]]}]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",[{"type":"[[","value":[["New Zealand"]]}]]},"\n      ",{"type":"<","value":["td",[{"type":"[[","value":[["Ireland"]]}]]},"\n    "]]},"\n"]]},"\n\nSee our article on ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Teaching English#Tests"],["teaching English"]]}," for some discussion of widely used English tests.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["United States"]},"\n\nUnsurprisingly, as the most powerful and influential country in the world, the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United States of America"],["United States"]]}," is one of the top destinations for students wishing to pursue an education abroad. The United States is particularly known for its universities, many of which are ranked among the most prestigious universities in the world. Examples of such institutions include ",{"type":"'''","value":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology"]}," as well as a group of 8 of the world's most prestigious universities known as the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Ivy League"]},".\n\nInstitutions range from some of the world's most prestigious universities, to many lower-ranked institutions whose quality of education may be questionable. Unlike in many other countries, there is no centralized governmental body which regulates the academic standards for university education, meaning that universities are by and large free to decide their own admissions process, syllabi and academic standards. This means that the quality of education, study environment, and reputation varies widely from institution to institution. This also means that there is no centralized body which manages university applications, and you will need to apply directly to each institution you are interested in attending. However, practically all universities are accredited by non-governmental, regional academic standards bodies and many courses of study are accredited by similar bodies or by professional organizations (such as the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology for most engineering programs or the American Bar Association for legal studies). Even within the universities, lecturers are often given considerably more freedom to set their own syllabi and examinations than those in universities in many other countries, so two similar courses taught by different lecturers can also be drastically different in their focus and difficulty.\n\nMost public universities are part of the state university systems, which are partially subsidized by state governments, and may have many campuses spread around the state, with hundreds of thousands of students. Private colleges are generally smaller (hundreds or a few thousand students), with a larger percentage of their students living on campus; some are affiliated with churches and may be more religious in character. Other kinds of colleges focus on teaching specific job skills, education for working adults, and providing inexpensive college-level education to local residents. Although nearly all colleges are open to students regardless of race, gender, religion, etc. many were originally established for a particular group (e.g. African-Americans, women, members of a particular religion) and may still attract primarily students from that group. Several private colleges remain female-only, there are a few male-only private colleges, and private religious colleges may expect students to practice the school's faith.\n\nBachelor degree programs in the US are typically 4 years in length, and require a student to study a broad range of subjects, including several courses outside their chosen major, in order to graduate. Master degree programs, which are typically 2 years in length, are usually more specialised, and typically require students to take advanced level courses, and in some cases require the completion of a thesis. PhD programs are typically 5 years in length, and require the student to take advanced level courses and undergo several lab rotations, and also require the completion and successful defense of a research disseration. Unlike in the UK, medicine and law degree programs are graduate (UK: postgraduate) programs in the US, and fall into a special category called professional doctorates, which are typically 3 years in length for law, and 4 years in length for medicine.\n\nStudents applying to American universities are usually required to sit for a standardized test. For undergraduate programs, this is typically the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/sat.collegeboard.org\/ SAT"]}]}," or the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.actstudent.org\/ ACT"]}]}," (some schools prefer one or the other, but all universities accept both). For graduate (UK: postgraduate) programs, the test required depends on the course of study. This is typically the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["https:\/\/www.aamc.org\/students\/applying\/mcat\/ MCAT"]}]}," for medicine, the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.lsac.org\/jd\/lsat LSAT"]}]}," for law, the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.mba.com\/us GMAT"]}]}," for business, and the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ets.org\/gre GRE"]}]}," for most other majors. Test of English as a Foreign Language (",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.ets.org\/toefl TOEFL"]}]},") is also often required from students from countries where English is not the main native language.\n\nShort courses that do not count as credits towards the awarding of an academic degree may be undertaken on a tourist visa, or under the visa-waiver program. Any courses that contribute credits towards the awarding an academic degree will require you to obtain a student visa in advance regardless of how short your stay in the US may be. (This rule does not apply to citizens of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Palau"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Marshall Islands"]]}," and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Federated States of Micronesia"]]},".) In order to apply for a student visa, you will need to present an ",{"type":"'''","value":["I-20"]}," form from the college, pay a ",{"type":"[","value":["https:\/\/www.fmjfee.com\/i901fee\/index.jsp '''SEVIS fee"]},{"type":"'''","value":[", and demonstrate evidence of "]},"sufficient funds'",{"type":"''","value":[" to cover your tuition fees and living expenses for the duration of your course.

",{"type":"[[","value":[["Canada"],["Canadians"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bermuda"],["Bermudians"]]}," are exempt from having to obtain a student visa, but are otherwise subject to the same requirements and restrictions as other international students. Note that unless you have applied for and received special permission in advance, international students are "]},"not'' allowed to work off campus in the United States.\n\nCommunity colleges typically offer college-credit courses on an open-admissions basis; anyone with a high school degree or its equivalent and the required tuition payment can generally enroll. In large cities, open universities may offer short non-credit courses on all sorts of practical topics, from ballroom dance to buying real estate. They are a good place to learn a new skill and meet people.\n\nColleges are partially funded by \"tuition\" charged to the student, which is often quite expensive, very commonly reaching into the tens of thousands of dollars per year. The most selective colleges (and hence, often the most desirable) run up to $40,000-50,000 per year, including both tuition and \"room & board\" in that price. In general, private universities charge the same tuition fees for both U.S. and international students. Public universities generally offer subsidized tuition fees only to U.S. citizens or permanent residents who reside in their state, meaning that students from interstate are usually required to pay full tuition fees like international students. Most U.S. citizens and some permanent residents receive substantial financial assistance from the federal and state governments in the form of grants and low-interest loans, which are not available to non-citizens. Often financial aid for foreign students is provided by their home country. They may be eligible for privately-funded \"scholarships\" intended to provide educational opportunities for various kinds of students.  Some U.S. and major global banks offer loans to foreign students, which usually require a citizen to guarantee that they'll be repaid.  Contact the Financial Aid Office of any college you are interested in attending for more information about the sources of aid available.\n\nCollege sports in the U.S. tend to get more attention than in other countries, with games between the top colleges often shown on television during prime time slots. Many universities offer ",{"type":"'''","value":["sports scholarships"]}," to students, including international students, who are outstanding in a particular college sport, even if their academic record may be less than stellar.\n\nAlmost all U.S. colleges and universities operate web sites (in the .edu domain) with information for prospective students and other visitors. Information on touring a handful of them has been collected into ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Touring prestigious and notable universities in the U.S."]]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["United Kingdom"]},"\n\nWith its long history as a centre of education, the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["United Kingdom"]]}," is also a very popular destination for international students. Unsurprisingly, it is home to some of the world's oldest and most prestigious universities such as the ",{"type":"'''","value":["University of Oxford"]}," and the ",{"type":"'''","value":["University of Cambridge"]},", collectively known among locals as \"Oxbridge\". Of course, there are also many other institutions which are of good standing domestically and internationally. ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]}," is also known as a centre of education and is home to more international students than any other city in the world. \n\nThe vast majority of British universities are public universities, and there are only two private universities in the UK.\n\nBachelor degree programmes in the UK are usually 3 years in length, though engineering programmes are usually 4 years, and medicine is 6 years. Bachelor degree programmes in the UK tend to be very specialised and structured, and generally require students to demonstrate an in-depth understanding in their chosen major. Unlike in the US, medicine and law are typically undergraduate programmes in the UK. Master degree programmes are typically 1 year in length, and can be either coursework or research programmes. PhD programmes are typically 3 years in length, and require the completion and successful defence of a research thesis. However, some universities are also beginning to offer 4-year PhD programmes, which are modelled after the US system, and require students to undergo a year of lab rotations before starting their PhD thesis project.\n\nStandardised testing is generally not practised in the UK, though some MBA programmes require prospective students to sit for the ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.mba.com\/global\/the-gmat-exam.aspx GMAT"]}]}," before they can apply.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Australia"]},"\n\nDue to its proximity to Asia, reputation for good quality and relatively easy admission criteria and visa arrangements, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Australia"]]}," is a popular destination for international students. All Australian universities actively seek international students, and students from overseas make up a high proportion of enrollments in many institutions as well as across the university system as a whole. \n\nThe most prestigious universities in Australia are known as the Group of Eight, and while they are not as prestigious as the top American and British universities, they are in general of a high standard, and eight are consistently ranked among the top 100 in the world. The standard of the other Australian universities is also generally very good, and few Australian employers are concerned about which university job candidates graduated from given the widespread confidence in academic standards across the system.\n\nMost Australian universities are large public institutions, and there are only a handful of private universities (of which Bond University is the best-known). It's not unusual for universities to operate across multiple campuses in their home state or city, and several have international campuses as well. While most international students study in institutions located in Australia's major cities, some regional universities are very popular. Bridging courses and other support to settle into Australia are generally provided to international students, but are not always adequate.\n\nUseful resources to research and compare Australian universities include the ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.hobsonscoursefinder.com.au\/ Good Universities Guide"]}," and the national government's ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/myuniversity.gov.au\/ MyUniversity"]}," website. The government's ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.studyinaustralia.gov.au\/ Study in Australia"]}," website also provides information about Australia's tertiary education system and the application process for potential international students.\n\nAustralian bachelor degree programmes are typically 3-4 years in length, though medicine is 6 years. Students in 3 year bachelor programmes who perform well academically can take an optional 4th year, which typically involves a year-long research project and requires the completion of a thesis, and upon completion would graduate with a bachelor honours degree, which in Australia is recognised as a qualification above a normal bachelor degree, but below a master degree. Students in some 4 year programmes sometimes have the option of incorporating their honours thesis and research project into their final year, while in other programmes the awarding of a bachelor honours degree is solely dependent on the student's GPA. Master degree programmes are typically 2 years in length, and can be either coursework or research degrees. Coursework master degrees sometimes involve a research component, which requires the student to complete a thesis to graduate. Admissions to a PhD programmes typically require a student to have a master degree, or a bachelor honours degree of class 2A or better. PhD programmes are exclusively research degrees, and require the successful completion of a research thesis or a series of papers to graduate. However, unlike in the US and UK, PhD students are typically not required to defend their thesis.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Canada"]},"\n\nWith its proximity to the United States, but with arguably more relaxed visa regulations and less competitive admissions to its universities, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Canada"]]}," is also emerging as a popular destination for international students.

In addition, the Singapore government has been providing a lot of funding to turn Singapore into a biomedical research hub, so there is substantial funding available for research students.\n\nBachelor degree programmes in Singapore are typically 3-4 years, though medicine is 6 years. Students in 3-year bachelor degree programmes who perform well academically can take an optional 4th year, during which they conduct a research project an write a thesis, and upon successful completion graduate with a bachelor honours degree. Students in 4-year programmes are typically awarded bachelor honours degrees based on their GPA. Master degree programmes are typically 1-2 years, and can be either coursework or research degrees. PhD programmes are exclusively research degree programmes that require the completion and successful defence of a thesis, and typically take about 4 years to complete.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Non English-speaking"]},"\n",{"type":"====","value":["Germany"]},"\n\nKnown worldwide for its advanced industries and technological prowess, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Germany"]]}," is rapidly becoming a center for international students looking to pursue higher education. Driven by stricter visa and immigration policies and skyrocketing tuition fees and living expenses in popular study destinations (like the UK and the US etc), international students are increasingly opting Germany as their preferred education destination. Germany's long standing history of education (with colleges as old as those in England) and state-funded education (meaning a very little or NO tuition fee) was probably overlooked because of the language barrier (most of the education is still imparted in German), but now more and more German universities are offering programs taught in English, either partly or completely.\nGerman government is actively promoting its higher education in developing countries (such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["China"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["India"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brazil"]]},") by setting up ",{"type":"[","value":["https:\/\/www.daad.de\/en\/ DAAD"]}," centers worldwide, offering generous scholarships, research grants and counseling support to students wishing to go for higher education abroad.\n\nGermany's universities are recognised internationally; in the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) for 2013, four of the top 100 universities in the world are in Germany, and 14 of the top 200. Most of the German universities are public institutions, charging tuition fees of only around â‚¬60 per semester (and up to â‚¬500 in the state of Niedersachsen) for each student. Thus, academic education is open to most citizens and studying is very common in Germany. Although the dual education system, that combines practical and theoretical educations and does not lead to academic degrees, is more popular than anywhere else in the world - while it is a role model for other countries.\n\nThe oldest universities of Germany are also among the oldest and best regarded in the world, with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Heidelberg"]]}," University being the oldest (established in 1386 and in continuous operation since then).
