[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Mena-asia_default_banner.jpg"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Stung Treng"]}," (also ",{"type":"''","value":["Stoeng Treng"]},") is a small town in northeastern ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cambodia"]]},", and can easily be described with the word \"outpost\" more than anything else. Many tourists heading to\/from Laos pass through here, though few stay long as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Banlung"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kratie"]]}," offer far more excitement, activities, and remedies.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\nFast boats used to be the best way to get here, but Chinese money has made the roads a joy (at least compared to their old state!). Regular boat services north and south no longer run, though small speedboats can be chartered for trips to non-standard destinations.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By road"]},"\nHwy 7 from the Laos-Cambodian border to Kratie via Stung Treng is fully sealed now. It's no problem to do the trip by bus\/minibus in either direction. Every guesthouse will sell you a ticket. It can be quiet difficult to get public transport directly at the border, so it's worth considering buying a ticket to your final destination. The minibus to the border takes about 1Â½hr, while it's a 4-5 hr drive to Kratie (much more in the rainy season). Minibus drivers have been known to abandon their passengers at the border crossing at Dom Kralor.\n\nThe daily bus from Phnom Penh to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Laos"]]}," passes the town in the afternoon and is the safest option to get to Laos. \n\nTrucking from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kratie"]]}," is also an option, and will set you back 20-25,000 riel for riding in the back of the truck, and 25-30,000 riel if you wish to ride in the cabin. Trucking is somewhat less safe than other modes of transport, and can take much longer. However, trucking in Cambodia puts you in much greater direct contact with the locals (as it's locals you'll be sharing a truck with most of the time), and isn't that one of the purposes of travelling?\n\nThere is a bridge being built to the west side of the river but as of May 2014 it is not complete. There is a ferry covering that can take cars and bikes. A motorbike was a few dollars to cross in May 2014. The road to Preah Vihear \/ Anlong veng is unsealed for the road 64 part. After that it's very nicely sealed all the way. Be warned there are long stretches without gasoline so top up frequently.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nSince the town is so small, there's no point in using anything other than your own two feet to get you anywhere within the town itself. If you decide to see any of the area's limited sights, simply hire one of the few motodops around for no more than a couple of thousand riel.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nMost tourists who end up here do so only for a couple of hours before rushing south to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kratie"]]}," or north to the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Laos"]]}," border. But, like anywhere in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Cambodia"]]},", you could easily spend a day here relaxing by the river (don't plan on a week here). There are a couple of sights to see here, but not enough to seriously keep yourself occupied. \n\nThe only meaningful sight in Stung Treng is watching the sun set and rise over the landscape. Great for lounging in a hammock, bottle of Angkor Beer in hand, lazily chatting with your compadres.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nStung Treng Province is a beautiful place with some historical value as well. The Ramsar site to the north that connects to Laos is a real treat to explore and several (nearly extinct) Irrawaddy dolphin pools surround this charming provincial town. Furthermore several NGO's such as Tourism for Help and Mlub Baitong are active in the region and welcome any kind of support from travellers where needed. The town links well to Banlung (Ratanakiri) and can be used for more than just a stopover. Hikes are available to see the 4,000 Islands area from the mountain top and the unique merging of 4 main rivers (also known as the Mekong plus 3 Area) makes the place for a great river exploration.\n\nThere exists a ",{"type":"'''","value":["weaving co-operative"]}," towards the north end of town, which warrants a visit for the lovely fabrics and patterns they produce.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Mekong Discovery Trail"],["url=http:\/\/mekongdiscoverytrail.com"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=The Mekong Discovery Trail takes you into the heart of the Mekong where the beauty of the river and the friendliness of the people create unforgettable river life experiences in northeast Cambodia.\n\n:The Mekong Discovery Trail is a network of safe, eco-tourism journeys through some of the most natural and least populated parts of the Mekong.\n\n:The free trail guide provides maps, transport and accommodation options.
