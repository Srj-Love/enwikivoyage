The water-fountains and cafes in the center of the town are a great spot for people watching. The townhouse itself is lit up at night with spotlights that highlight the beauty of the building.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nThe town comes alive at night. The street Matija Korvina (off the main pedestrian street \"Korzo\") seems like the most happening, with a number of popular bars and restaurants (Boss, Stara, Beer&Co). \nIn the summer there are many festivals of music, film, food, and any other excuse creative people can find.\nThere is a large market about 2km west of the center called \"Buvljak\" or \"Ocskapiac\" (meaning flea market), where a morning can be gone in a flash.\n8km to the east is Palic, an idyllic lakeside town of 6,000 people (take bus no. 6 to get there). The parks surrounding the lake are popular with tourists from the region.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nThe local dishes are definitely worth seeking out, as they are done really well and are quite cheap as well.\n\nThe region's famous fast-food is Burek. It is a pastry with various fillings like cheese, mince, mushroom, etc. It costs about 100 dinars (1 euro), a bit more with \"tekuci jogurt\" (a liquid form of savoury yoghurt). Most bakeries will have it, as well as specialized shops where it is made in front of you. An experience not to be missed!\n\nAlso worth seeking out is \"chevapi\", small skinless sausages served in a flat bread called \"lepinje\". \n\nGrilled or barbecued meats are also a tradition, so they are done masterfully. Look for places displaying the sign \"Rostilj\" \n\nIf looking for full service, an upmarket ambiance and international menu, check out Boss Cafe in the center of town; is a really nice place to spend time and the pizza is excellent.

Try to find some that was made for own consumption (and not for sale) for the best quality!\nAnother local specialty is a bitter herbal liqueur called \"Gorki List\" (various knock-offs are called Pelinkovac, as they are all made from the herb called Pelin, but this is the real deal). It aids digestion, so drink it some time before the meal.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nThere is a hostel with clean modern private rooms for 900 Dinar per night.
