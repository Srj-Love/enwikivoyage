Fresh fruit and vegetables are very common. \nLocal Sudanese breads are Kissra, a bread made from durra or corn; Aseeda, a porridge made from wheat, millet or corn; Gurassa, a thick bread from wheat flour similar to pancake, but thicker.\nOne local Northern Sudanese dish is Gurassa Bil Damaa which is a bread of unleavened wheat similar to a pancake but thicker, topped up with meat stew.\nSome Eastern Sudanese dishes are Mukhbaza which is made of shredded wheat bread mixed with mashed bananas and honey, and Selaat, which is lamb meat cooked over heated stones and Gurar which is a kind of local sausage cooked in a similar way to Selaat.\nOne of the popular dish from western Sudan is Agashe, a dish prepared with meat seasoned with ground peanuts and spices (mainly hot chilli), and cooked on a grill or an open flame. \nOne of the main attractions is Sug al Naga (The camel market) North of Omdurman, where you can select your meat of choice and then hand it over to one of the ladies to cook it for you in the way which you prefer.\nSudan also has some refreshing drinks such as Karkade (hibiscus) which can be served hot or chilled, aradeeb (tamarind) and gongleiz (made with the baobab fruit).\nThe local energy drink is a carbohydrates laden drink known as Madeeda. There are several types of Madeeda, made with dates or with Dukhun (Millet) or other types blended with fresh milk, and usually heavily sweetened with Sugar.

Not to be taken before bed though if you want an undisturbed night's sleep! \nThe general advice is not to drink tap water; in most rural areas, you will not be able to, as there are no taps... Where there are no bore holes (which often yield water that is fine to drink), water is often taken directly from the Nile.\nHowever, while alcohol is strictly illegal in the Muslim north, locally brewed alcohol is widely available in various forms and at various degrees of potency. A local beer (merissa) brewed from sorghum or millet is cloudy, sour and heavy and likely to be brewed with untreated water and will almost certainly lead to the 'Mahdi's revenge' (the Sudanese version of 'Delhi belly'). Aragi is a pure spirit distilled from sorghum or in its purest form, dates. Potent and powerful it should be treated with respect and is sometimes contaminated with the likes of methanol or embalming fluid (!) to add flavour and potency. Be aware though that all these brews, other than potentially hazardous for your health, are illegal and being caught in possession can result in the full implementation of Islamic law punishments.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nI) Larger Towns and Cities\n\nMost larger towns and cities have affordable hotels, although not as cheap as you might imagine. Quality is generally consistent within the price range. \n\nBasic hotels provide a bed and a fan with shared bathroom\/toilet facilities. There may be more than one bed in the room but you are usually expected to pay for the whole room. The bigger the group of travellers, the more economical these rooms are, as more beds are often put in a room (within reason) to accommodate everybody without the price being changed. Some hotels have cheaper beds outside in the open as in smaller towns and cities. These hotels are not very clean but are cheap and perfectly acceptable for short stays. \n\nLower mid-range hotels - more likely to be found in Khartoum - offer the worst value for money. They may have en suite bathrooms, (mostly evaporative) air conditioning and satellite television, but for what you're paying (two or three times that of basic hotels depending on your bargaining skills) the rooms are extremely tatty and hotel owners will almost always subscribe to the philosophy of: 'Only fix something if the guest complains'. There will sometimes be rooms minus the bathroom\/air conditioning\/television for prices a little above those in basic hotels.\n\nUpper mid-range hotels are the next step up, with spotless rooms of a far higher quality but prices (usually quoted in dollars) closer to what you'd expect in the West. You'll have little to find fault with, though. \n\nTop-end hotels are commonly of the Five Star variety, and include the Hilton. The few are found mostly in Khartoum. They are much more expensive than the upper mid-range hotels.\n\nII) Outside Larger Towns and Cities\n\nOutside larger towns and cities hotels don't normally go above basic. That means bedframes with either simply a string mesh or with thin mattresses; that is not to say they are uncomfortable. They are offered (generally in fours or fives) in rooms where there is often a ceiling fan to keep things cool. The beds are usually cheaper - and more fun to sleep in - out in the courtyard under the stars, although there is obviously less privacy and security. As with the basic hotels in larger towns and cities, it is more often than not impossible to rent one bed in a room as you might in a dormitory. Hotel owners insist that you rent the whole room. Rooms become unavailable quickly at certain times (weekends, for example). Showers may be bucket showers, with water straight out of the Nile if your route follows that river. \n\nCamping in the wild is easy in rural areas outside the south as long as the usual precautions are taken.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Learn"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Work"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\nSafety in Sudan has many dimensions.

Sudan has a highly militarized border with its neighbor Egypt and Westerners are increasingly running into problems at the border if they wish to cross. \n\nBus travel is also not without its issues. Some buses are better than others - some are excellent, with icy-cold AC and complementary drinks, others may be less salubrious - there is nothing worse than sitting in a hot bus (did we mention no A\/C?) with jabbering Egyptian tourists for nearly an entire day.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Personal safety"]},"\nThere is almost no likelihood of being physically attacked (mugged) for your possessions, but keep an eye on your things in public places, e.g. street cafes.

First and foremost, you need a permit to take pictures (see \"Get in\" section above for details) which will tell you where you can and cannot take pictures. Photographing or filming military personnel or installations is a ",{"type":"'''","value":["quick way"]}," to get into trouble. People have been arrested for taking pictures at the confluence of the Blue and White Niles in Khartoum.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["LGBT travellers"]},"\nSudan is an Islamic country and consumption of alcohol is illegal. Homosexuality is punishable by ",{"type":"'''","value":["death"]},".\nThe death sentence for homosexuality is mainly only enforced after the second or third repeated offense. Mainly the first offense it is usually imprisonment and about a thousand lashes for both men and women, (which is virtually the death penalty anyway, it would be surprising if anyone could survive that sort of harsh punishment). The government's form of punishing those convicted of homosexual acts is dealt with under the strict interpretation of the Islamic Sharia Law. If a foreigner is arrested for committing a homosexual act, that person may probably either be given a warning if \"truly remorseful\" or be dealt with in the same manner as the Sudanese national. Ask for consular assistance from your government if you are arrested.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\nSudan is a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["malaria"],["malarial"]]}," region, so be especially cautious during the rainy season.  Poisonous snakes, spiders and scorpions are common to the southern areas. \n\nBe cautious when drinking water. Make sure you choose bottled water, or use purifying tablets. Also, avoid any fruit drinks, as they are obviously made with the local water. And remember, that any ice cubes ( for example, in sodas) are only frozen local water. \n\nOn long trips (particularly during the hot season) on public transport it is often impossible - or would be expensive - to carry the amount of bottled water you need, and it may be scarce at certain remote stops. Therefore, keep plenty of your chosen means of purification close at hand (not in your luggage strapped to the roof!). Sanitation in some areas is nonexistent, so wash your hands frequently. \n\nFood from streetside vendors is generally fine if it is being prepared and served frequently. Empty restaurants and street cafes often indicate that food is standing uncovered and unrefrigerated for hours at a time. \n\nSudanese currency is notoriously dirty, and even the Sudanese handle small bills as little as possible. A hint would be to carry antibacterial wipes or gel in your luggage to treat your hands after handling filthy currency notes or shaking too many unwashed hands. \n\nSudan has reported Ebola outbreaks in 2004 and it is not advised to take local hospital treatments unless there is a real urgency. If you have malaria-like symptoms, seek medical assistance when possible, medical treatment is also available in many private clinics with high standards and reasonable price here are some of these private clinics: (",{"type":"'''","value":["Doctors clinic"]},", Africa St, ",{"type":"'''","value":["Fidail medical center"]},", Hospital road Downtown, ",{"type":"'''","value":["Yastabshiron medical center"]},", Riyadh area, ",{"type":"'''","value":["Modern medical center"]},", Africa St, ",{"type":"'''","value":["International Hospital"]},", Khartoum north-Alazhary St)\n\nSchistosomiasis\/Bilharzia - Avoid bathing or walking through slow-flowing fresh waterways.

Alcohol and drugs are forbidden, though many people dip a kind of snuff, and a few make moonshine.  Sudanese women tend to wear very conservative clothing and cover their heads, so foreign women would be wise to do the same, even if they observe other tourists who do not respect this custom.  Men should wear long trousers, not shorts. If in doubt, play it safe and cover up.\n\nThe Sudanese do not expect foreigners to adhere to Ramadan, the holy month of fasting, but it would be tactless to eat, drink or smoke in public. (Many people, ",{"type":"''","value":["e.g.,"]}," diabetics and those traveling more than a certain distance, are exempt from Ramadan, so it is possible to find open restaurants during the day but they are not well advertised.)\n\nBe assured that any foreigner will be treated as a local, and dealt with accordingly, in many cases, given a jail sentence of several months and a whipping, the minimum being forty lashes (it may be more, according to the discretion of the local cleric).  Distances between towns or villages being far, and news may travel very slow because of the political unrest, so your government, if it even knows or cares to interfere, may not be willing or able to help you.\n\nDo not in any circumstances, show images\/statues\/figures etc. of the prophet Muhammad. A heated controversy erupted when a British schoolteacher in Sudan allowed one of her students to name a teddy bear \"Muhammad\", prompting angry protests in Sudan.
