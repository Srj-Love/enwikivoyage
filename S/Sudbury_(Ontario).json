It is Northern Ontario's largest city in both area and population, and a major retail and service centre for the region.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\nSudbury's weather is typical of locations on the Canadian Shield, with both hot summers and cold winters. The city is particularly renowned for its outdoor recreation opportunities, with both summer and winter activities being quite popular. The city has a somewhat unfair and outdated reputation as an environmental wasteland, due to past environmental damage from the local mining industry, but various environmental reclamation projects since the 1970s have given many parts of the city a rugged natural beauty that capitalizes on the region's many lakes, forests and rocky hills.\n\nInternational visitors to Sudbury will feel right at home. The city is home to vibrant Italian, Finnish, Ukranian, French, Polish and Aboriginal communities. One can expect to hear many of these languages being spoken regularly, though almost all residents speak English as well. Since Sudbury is officially bilingual, all city services are available in both French and English. Road signs and street names are also posted in both official languages. The city celebrates its multicultural heritage on the Bridge of Nations, a downtown structure featuring the flags of every world nation represented among the city's population.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nThe Greater Sudbury Airport (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["YSB"]]},") is served by Air Canada Jazz, which provides six daily flights in and out of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Toronto"]]},"'s Pearson International Airport (YYZ), and Bearskin Airlines, which provides flights to and from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sault Ste Marie (Ontario)"],["Sault Ste.

(Highway 400 will eventually extend all the way to Sudbury; however, this construction is not currently expected to be completed until 2017.)\n\nHighway 144 leads north to Timmins.\n\nSome quiet roads are in poor shape, however much effort has been put into repairing them.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\n\nSudbury is served by Greyhound connections to Ottawa, Sault Ste.

The urban core of the city is served by lines that generally operate on the half hour during peak travel times, and on the hour late at night and on Sundays. More remote areas of the city are not served as frequently, but some bus service is available.\n\nYou can take the bus from one end of town to the other (about 60 km) for $2.80.
