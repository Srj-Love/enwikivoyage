The festival has a 400-odd year history, and was started to commemorate the defense of the city against an attack by a feudal lord. In order to ward off their would-be attackers, residents constructed a number of giant torches and set them alight on top of a hill. \nThe festival includes a parade, during which the 10m long torches are carried throught the streets of the town, before finally being erected on top of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Midorigaoka park"]}," and then set alight. Torches are constructed and\/or sponsored by local schools and businesses, whose students or employees later carry them in the parade.\n\nThe festival is free and takes place on the second Saturday of November every year. The parade generally starts around midafternoon, culminating in the erection and lighting of the torches from about 6 or 7pm.\n\nAccess to the festival is free, and there are usually free buses available from outside the station to Midorigaoka park.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["routebox-2"],["image1=JR Tohoku icon.png"],["imagesize1=100"],["directionl1=N"],["majorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fukushima"]]}],["minorl1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Koriyama"]]}],["directionr1=S"],["majorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Utsunomiya"]]}],["minorr1=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shirakawa"]]}],["image2=Tohoku Expwy Route Sign.svg"],["imagesize2=100"],["directionl2=N"],["majorl2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fukushima"]]}],["minorl2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Koriyama"]]}],["directionr2=S"],["majorr2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Utsunomiya"]]}],["minorr2=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shirakawa"]]}]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Sukagawa, Fukushima"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["37.2833"],["140.3833"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Fukushima_(prefecture)"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Sukagawa, Fukushima"]]}]
