The Dutch arrived in 1605 and were quickly followed by the English, who established a factory in Makassar. In 1905 the entire island became part of the Dutch state colony of the Netherlands East Indies until Japanese occupation in World War II.  Following the transfer of sovereignty in December 1949, Sulawesi became part of the federal United States of Indonesia, which in 1950 became absorbed into the unitary Republic of Indonesia.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Religion"]},"\nSulawesi's tough terrain, massive size (174,600 km²) and great marine tradtions, have combined to cause a wildly divergent set of peoples and cultures, speaking eight major languages and professing Muslim, Christian,  Hindu and animist beliefs (not to mention various mixes thereof).\n\nIslam is the majority religion in Sulawesi. The conversion of the lowlands of the south western peninsula in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["South Sulawesi"]]}," to Islam occurred in the early 17th century.

The famous Toraja people of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tana Toraja"]]}," in Central Sulawesi have largely converted to Christianity since Indonesia's independence. \n\nThough most people identify themselves as Muslims or Christians, they often subscribe to local beliefs and deities as well. It is not uncommon for Christians to make offerings to local gods, goddesses, and spirits.\n\nSulawesi has been plagued by Muslim-Christian violence in recent years. The most serious violence occurred between 1999 and 2001 on the once peaceful island, with heavy involvement of Islamist militias such as Laskar Jihad. Over 1,000 people were killed in violence, riots, and ethnic cleansing that ripped through Central Sulawesi. In 2003, 13 Christian villagers were killed in the Poso District by unknown masked gunmen. And in 2005 three Christian schoolgirls were beheaded in Poso by Islamic militants.
