While for many visitors it is synonymous with the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Catskills"]]},", only two of the range's hundred highest peaks are in Sullivan, and it would be more accurately described as the southwestern foothills of those mountains. Other times, it's included as part of the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hudson Valley"]]},", although most of the county is in the drainage basin of the Delaware River, which forms its western border.\n\nThe county's main artery, New York State Route 17 (slowly being converted into Interstate 86), runs north-south through the center, with its two largest communities, Liberty and the county seat of Monticello, right along it. It also divides the county economically. Paradoxically, the half of the county to the east, more geared to tourism and in more wooded and mountainous terrain, is more developed and populous. West of Route 17, in the wider, sparsely populated valleys that flow down to the Delaware, the main business is dairy farming. \n\nA little bit too far from the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Metro New York"],["metropolitan area"]]}," for a practical daily commute, the county's relationship to the city has been as a weekend and vacation spot. To talk about Sullivan County as a destination for travelers it's best to start by talking about its past, about the reasons people ",{"type":"''","value":["used"]}," to go there: the fabled Catskill Borscht Belt resorts. This era began in the early years of the 20th century, when Jewish emigrants from Eastern Europe looking for land to farm settled in this quiet rural backwater. In the summers, many of them started taking in fellow Jews who had settled in New York City as boarders. Shut out of other resorts of the era on account of their ethnicity, and wanting to keep kosher, these guests regularly returned to their mountain escapes from the crowded and hot tenements they called home.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Woodstock redmond crowd (cropped).jpg"],["Attendees at the Woodstock festival in 1969"],["right"],["thumb"]]},"\nEventually some of these farms evolved into resorts, either by expanding their farmhouses into hotels, adding small bungalow colonies on the property or both. The resort owners strove to offer something for every member of the family. During the day there were games of \"Simon Says\" and mah-jongg, with Yiddish heard as often as English. At night, especially on weekends, there was the entertainment—many future stars of stage and screen honed their skills on this circuit, as ",{"type":"''","value":["tummlers"]}," on the stage telling jokes or musicians in the bands.\n\nThe Borscht Belt enjoyed its peak in the mid-20th century. The passage of the Civil Rights Act ended the discrimination that had fostered the resorts, and in an era of improved roads guests began staying for weekends rather than weeks at a time. The children and grandchildren of the early immigrants, more culturally assimilated than their parents and grandparents had been, preferred other ways of spending their leisure time. In 1969 they joined their fellow baby boomers at the Woodstock Music and Arts Festival, \"3 Days of Peace, Love and Music\", at Max Yasgur's dairy farm in Bethel, the largest gathering of people in the county's history.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Concord Resort Hotel Demolished.JPG"],["thumb"],["Former site of the Concord"]]},"\nToday many of the larger resorts are in limbo—the Concord has been demolished, Grossinger's caught up between developers—and many of the smaller ones have vanished completely. That era is relived in movies like ",{"type":"''","value":["Dirty Dancing"]},", ",{"type":"''","value":["Mr. Saturday Night"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["A Walk on the Moon"]},". A summer Jewish presence remains in the Sullivan County Catskills, but it is primarily Orthodox Hasidim, as the hatted and wigged crowds on the streets of South Fallsburg and Woodbourne, the many small synagogues listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the Hebrew lettering on signs at those bungalow colonies that still operate attest. \n\nSullivan's glory days are behind it, all in the county agree. But hopes persist that they could return, and they may finally be bearing fruit. The Woodstock festival site is now home to the Bethel Woods Performing Arts Center, which hosts several major acts, including some that played the original festival, each year. \n\nGambling has been another attraction. Slot machines were recently installed at Monticello raceway, and in 2013 New York's voters approved a proposal to allow casino gambling off Indian reservations. Sullivan's voters supported it by a three-to-one margin, and as of this writing several casino proposals for the former resort country are being floated. By the time you get there, construction could be underway.\n\nAnother group of visitors that began coming in the early 20th century has, however, never stopped. In the 1890s Theodore Gordon, a young man from Pittsburgh, came to the Catskills to seek relief from his tuberculosis in the mountain air. Sullivan County may not have the Catskills' highest mountains, but as a result it is filled with lakes, and the streams that drain them. Gordon began fishing for their abundant trout, and writing about those efforts for various magazines of the era.\n\nHe had used wet flies, which he tied himself from an 1860s manual, as a lure. In the 1900s a British angler with whom corresponded sent him a batch of dry flys, meant to be floated on the water rather than sunk in it. The first American dry fly was cast into Willowemoc Creek above Livingston Manor late that decade, and American angling has never been the same since. Gordon spent the remaining years of his life adapting the English patterns to Catskill waters and developing many of his own to mimic the insects the various trout species in the waters had come to know.\n\nGordon succumbed to his illness in 1915, but others carried on his work, and both patterns and sections of the streams bear their names today. Anglers kept coming, and gradually the Catskill trout streams became a mecca of American fly-fishers. In 1979, President Jimmy Carter and his wife flew up to Roscoe for some master classes with the late Lee Wulff. After Wulff's death, a fly-fishing museum and training center was established nearby.\n\nToday the fly-fishers still come, their tan waders and vests as distinctive an attire to Sullivan County as that of the Hasidim. They're joined by other outdoor recreationists, too. Whether casinos get built or not, consider checking out this county's many lakes, streams, and woodlands.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\nWhile the Hasidic visitors who throng the streets of some villages in the summertime often speak Yiddish amongst themselves, they're all native American English speakers as well. So don't be apprehensive about talking to them if you need or want to, unless you have problems understanding a heavy Brooklyn accent.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nFor decades every visitor to Sullivan County has come by road, in a car or bus.

Officially an east-west route, in Sullivan it runs more north-south, directly through the center of the county, serving as its spine and dividing east from west—Liberty, Monticello and Roscoe are right along the highway. Grade intersections in the northern areas are being eliminated as part of the interstate conversion, to the detriment of small towns like Parksville that depended on the pull-off traffic which now bypasses the town completely (nevertheless, the I-86 upgrade had been sought locally for years).

The southern segment of this two-lane runs more north-south across the county, intersecting Route 17 at Monticello, then becoming Sullivan's only commercial strip for a brief distance along the road to the Fallsburgs and Woodbourne, paralleling the Neversink River all the way up to its northern terminus at tiny Grahamsville.\n\nA more direct approach from the east is ",{"type":"'''","value":["New York State Route 52"]},", another two-lane.
