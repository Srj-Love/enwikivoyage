With its location in the India-China sea trade route, several trading towns flourished, especially in the eastern coast, and were influenced by Indian religions and the Srivijaya Buddhist monarchy in particular.  \nThe Srivijayan influence waned in the 11th century and Sumatra was then subject to conquests from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Java"]]},"nese kingdoms.  At the same time Islam made its way to Sumatra through Arabs and Indian traders in the 6th and 7th centuries. Marco Polo visited the island in 1292. The powerful Aceh Sultanate ruled from this time into the 20th century. With the coming of the Dutch, the many Sumatran princely states gradually fell under their control.  Aceh, in the north, was the major obstacle, as the Dutch were involved in the long and costly Aceh War (1873–1903).\n\nSumatra came under the control of the Dutch East Indies and became a major producer of pepper, rubber, and oil. In the early and mid-twentieth century, Sumatran academics and leaders were important figures in Indonesia's independence movements before full independence was gained in 1945.  \n\n",{"type":"====","value":["The 2004 Tsunami"]},"\nThe Great Sumatran fault runs the entire length of the island along its west coast.
