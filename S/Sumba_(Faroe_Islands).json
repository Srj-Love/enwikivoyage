It is the southernmost village in the Faroe Islands.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nThere are two roads, which connect Sumba with the village Lopra, one of these roads goes over the mountain, and passes by the 470 meter high sea cliff Beinisvørð. The road has only one lane, but there are meeting places and not much traffic. The road is very curvy, but a beautiful drive if you don't get seasick. You can make a stop when you come up on the top of the mountain, next to the high mast, there are only a few meters to the edge, and the cliff goes vertically down to the sea, right next to Beinisvørð. There is however an easier and faster way to get to Sumba. A road tunnel was made and ready to use in 1997. It goes from the valley of Lopra, below Beinisvørð and comes out west of the village Sumba. The public bus drives through the tunnel. \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Hesturin and Beinisvord, Vertical Cliffs of Suduroy, Faroe Islands.JPG"],["thumb"],["Hesturin and Beinisvørð, a 470 meter high sea cliff."]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Akraberg Lighthouse, Suduroy, Faroe Islands.JPG"],["thumb"],["Akraberg peninsula with the more than 100 year old lighthouse."]]},"\nIt is easy to get around in Sumba by feet, but of course you can also drive around with a car. If you travel by car and you wish to visit the cliff Beinisvørð, but you worry about the curvy road from Lopra, then it would be better, if you go to Sumba first via the tunnel, drive through the village and then take the old road which passes be the football field and goes up to Hesturin, which is next to Beinisvørð. You can park there on top of the mountain by the mast and walk the 50 meters or so to the edge, and of course you take care not to fall over the edge. The view is amazing, you can see rigth down to the sea and the cliffs and sea stacks below, and lots of birds flying around, if it is season for the birds. There is also a great view down to the village Sumba and the islet Sumbiarhólmur and towards north to a large part of the island. If it is not foggy you will also see the island Lítla Dímun and some of the other islands. In very clear weather one can see the Northern Islands too from Hesturin. After your visit on Hesturin and perhaps on Beinisvørð, if you wish to go for a walk on the cliff's backside, which is very green in summertime, then you can go back to your car and drive back to Sumba. On your way down to the village you will pass by a cross road, the left one has a sign saying \"Akraberg\". Akraberg is only 2 km away, it is well worth a visit, the road has only one lane, but again, there is not much traffic, and the road to Akraberg is not curvy, and there are meeting places there as well. Akraberg is a peninsula with a white painted lighthouse with red roof and a couple of red houses. There are high masts here also and lots of birds, when it is season for them, mainly in May to August. From Akraberg there is a beautiful view and a nice place to go for a walk. You can se Flesjarnar, which are a few rocks\/islets further south. The southernmost point of the Faroe Islands is Munkurin, which is one of Flesjarnar, it is also called Sumbiarsteinur. The Monk (Munkurin) is lying a bit by itself, away from the other cliffs. The road ends in Akraberg, you can turn your car around there and drive back again on the same route. If you travel to Sumba by the public bus, then you can go for a walk to Akraberg and up to Beinisvørð, if you have time for both.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Beinisvørð"]}," (Beinisvord), a 470 meter high sea cliff, one of the highest of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Europe"]]},".
