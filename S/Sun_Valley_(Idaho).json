By 1900, mining was clearly in decline in southern  Idaho. Many Idaho mountain mining settlements eventually became ghost towns, but the Blaine County communities managed to hang on, mostly due to the sheep industry.\n\nIn 1936, tourism entered Blaine County in a big way with the opening of the Sun Valley resort, which attracted the rich and famous from day one. A particularly famous early visitor was Ernest Hemingway, who spent his final days in the area and is buried in Ketchum. Today many well-known people maintain first or second homes in Blaine County.\n\nSun Valley revolves around tourism, with skiing in the winter and outdoor activities in the nearby ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sawtooth National Recreation Area"]]}," in the summer dominating the itinerary.
