[{"type":"{{","value":[["pagebanner"],["Sunbathing banner.jpg"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Sunburn"]}," is a symptom of a damaged skin produced by overexposure to the sun, and is a particular danger if you are outside on sunny days, though clouds do not always prevent it. Getting badly sunburnt on the first day of a sun and sand holiday can ruin the rest of your trip.\n\nThe main danger is from the ultraviolet (UV) part of the sun's radiation; these short-wavelength photons have higher energy than light in the visible part of the spectrum, so they do more damage. UV is not visible to human eyes and can penetrate both light-to-moderate cloud cover and some clothing, so it can be quite difficult to judge how much you are getting; try to err on the side of caution.\n\nA complication is that \"ozone holes\" in the upper atmosphere, apparently caused by pollution, allow more UV to reach the ground than formerly, so danger in polar regions (under the holes) has risen in recent years. It is not clear how far away from the poles this danger extends, and that may change over time, so anyone spending a lot of time outdoors at high latitude should take precautions.\n\nIn addition, sunburns and too much sun over the years can lead to skin cancer. The ",{"type":"''","value":["basal"]}," and ",{"type":"''","value":["squamous cell"]}," types aren't so bad as far as cancer goes, but their removal will leave unsightly scars. However, ",{"type":"''","value":["melanoma"]}," is just as lethal as the other deadly cancers. In the past few decades, it's become known that sunburns substantially increase the risk of melanoma.\n\nA related problem is ",{"type":"[[","value":[["#Heat_stroke"],["heat stroke"]]},"; this not caused exclusively by exposure to the sun, but is dealt with in this article.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Characteristics"]},"\n\nTypically there is initial redness (erythema), followed by varying degrees of pain, both proportional in severity to the duration and intensity of exposure. After being burned, the skin may turn red 2 to 6 hours later. Pain is worst 6 to 48 hours afterward. The burn continues to develop for 24 to 72 hours after exposure. Skin peeling begins 3 to 8 days after the burn occurs. Common outcomes include tenderness, pain, edema, red and\/or peeling skin, rash, nausea and fever. Sunburns may be first- or second-degree burns.\n\nMinor sunburns typically cause nothing more than slight redness and tenderness to the affected area. In more serious cases blistering can occur. Extreme sunburns can be painful to the point of debilitation and may require hospital care.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Be careful"]},"\n\nWhen travelling, you should take care to protect yourself from the sun, as it's common to spend more time outdoors. Never underestimate the power of the sun in tropical regions, the mountains, or even on an ordinary summer day around noontime. Skiing is particularly risky, because aside from direct sun, your body is also hit by sunlight reflected off a smooth, white surface. Similarly, sunlight is reflected by water.\n\nBefore you leave, try to get information on the weather conditions of the region you're traveling to, especially related to sunshine and sun power. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Increased risks"]},"\n\nYour susceptibility to sunburns is strongly dependent on your skin tone. People with red hair, green eyes and freckled skin are under the highest risk of contracting skin damage.\n\nThe risk of sunburn increases when the sun is directly overhead (see ",{"type":"'''","value":["UV index"]}," below). It can also be increased by the intake of pharmaceutical products. Certain antibiotics, contraceptives, tranquillizers, and malaria prophylaxis provoke over-sensitivity to sunshine. Leaving the juice of lemons or other citrus fruit on your skin will increase the rapidity and intensity of a burn. \n\nIn recent years, the incidence and severity of sunburn has increased worldwide, especially in the southern hemisphere, because of damage to the ozone layer due to CFCs which scientists believe has increased UV radiation to dangerous levels.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["UV index"]},"\n\nThe UV index is an international standard that provides information about the intensity of the sun rays and, thereby, potential damage from sunlight on a particular day. The higher the value of the index, the higher the risk for sunburn.\n\nMore and more weather stations and local newspapers include a prediction of the UV values for the days to come in their forecast. However, be aware that you will not find this information if you travel to less developed countries. It's wise to get the latest information just before you leave. There are a lot of websites where you can get UV-index predictions from all over the world.\n\nThe intensity of UV radiation is affected by the following seven factors: \n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Angle of the sun"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Latitude"]}," – strongest in tropics – specifically, the northern tropics from March 21st to September 21st, and the southern tropics from September 21st to March 21st "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Season"]}," – strongest in late spring and early summer assuming no clouds. As this period is quite cloudy in many areas, the peak can be locally pushed back to later in the summer. "]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Time of day"]}," – strongest from 9 am to 3 pm sun time, peaking at 12 noon. Sun time is more or less reflected in the local time, but as the latter is a political matter it may be off by even some hours. Add one hour where daylight savings is observed (i.e. 10 am to 4 pm). Adjust also for location in the time zone: the sun is early in the eastern edge (subtract half an hour if the zones are regular); later in the west (add half an hour)."]},"\nThese three factors can be combined into one easy measurement. The strongest rays are when the sun is above 45 degrees in the sky. In other words, your shadow is shorter than your actual height. Short shadows mean high UV intensity.\n\nFor the mathematically inclined, the general rules for the angle of the sun away from vertical at noon at latitude L are:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" L at the equinoxes, March and October, anywhere."]},{"type":"*","value":[" L-23° at the summer solstice for your hemisphere, June 21 in the Northern hemisphere and December 21 in the south."]},{"type":"*","value":[" L+23° at the winter solstice, dates opposite to above."]},"The tropics are the region where that angle is sometimes zero, L <= 23° so L-23° <= 0 < L+23°. Between the Tropic of Cancer (23°N) and Tropic of Capricorn (23°S), the sun is sometimes directly overhead.\n\nThe midnight sun occurs where L >= 67° so L+23° is sometimes greater than 90° and the winter sun is below the horizon even at noon. In summer, the sun is above the horizon even at midnight.\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Environmental factors"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Altitude"]}," – UV radiation increases rapidly with altitude.

It occurs on June 21st in the northern hemisphere, and December 21st in the southern hemisphere. Outside the tropics, it could bring the ",{"type":"'''","value":["highest level of UV radiation of the entire year"]},". Of course, the atmosphere hasn't had time to fully warm up to the peak of summer yet, and many places are still cloudy and cool. However, if it happens to be sunny, this is the time you need UV protection the most. On the first day of summer, the earth has completed shifting its axis by 23.5 degrees, and that brings tropical-like UV rays to the temperate zones. \n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" All locations in the tropics have the sun directly overhead at noon twice each year, and on an annual basis receive as much UV radiation as the equator does (assuming equal environmental factors)."]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" On the summer solstice, locations in the temperate zones (up to 47 degrees latitude) could receive ",{"type":"'''","value":["more"]}," UV radiation than the equator.

The real danger is that a fair-skinned person who hasn’t been exposed for months spends time out in the sun in the late spring or early summer unprotected. They may mistakenly think the UV radiation isn't so bad yet, when in fact, it's even worse.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Protection"]},"\n\nProtecting yourself is the best you can do. Here is some advice that could help you.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Sunglasses"]},"\n\nSunglasses are a must in bright sunlight, and especially in areas where the surroundings reflect sunlight,  such as beaches, glaciers, and deserts.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["cautionbox"],["Wearing sunglasses with no UV protection causes ",{"type":"'''","value":["more"]}," damage to your eyes than not wearing sunglasses at all, so make sure your sunglasses are from a reputable, UV-certified brand."]]},"\n\nAlso make sure your sunglasses leave no gaps in the field of vision: If you gaze downward and can see past the sunglasses, your eyes will still be exposed to some UV radiation. In environments with high UV intensity, such as high altitudes, use ski goggles rather than sunglasses.\n\nThough counter intuitive, ",{"type":"'''","value":["clear"]}," or ",{"type":"'''","value":["light tinted"]}," sunglasses offer better protection than ",{"type":"'''","value":["dark tinted"]}," ones, since a) your natural aversion to sunlight is preserved, and b) your pupils remain constricted, letting less light into your eyes.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Clothing"]},"\n\nClothing is by far the most effective defense against the sun, but not all clothing is UV resistant, and you can get burnt even while wearing some clothing.\n\nWhen travelling in a tropical environment, wear a ",{"type":"'''","value":["large hat"]}," or ",{"type":"'''","value":["headscarf"]},", a white or beige ",{"type":"'''","value":["long sleeved shirt"]}," made of ",{"type":"'''","value":["thick cotton"]},", and a pair of long trousers. Avoid wearing shorts and T-shirts; use long-sleeved ",{"type":"'''","value":["baggy clothing"]}," instead, which will keep you just as cool while avoiding sunburn. The back of your neck is especially prone to sunburn, so get a shirt with a collar and wear the collar upwards (or wear a cotton scarf).  Wear shoes and socks when possible.\n\nOn the ",{"type":"'''","value":["beach"]},", don't take your clothing off except when swimming.  Consider taking a sunshirt, and other clothing you can wear in the water. If you feel that staying fully clothed defies the whole point of beaches, wrap yourself in a thick ",{"type":"'''","value":["sarong"]}," while dressed in a swimming costume only.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Behaviour"]},"\n\nDon't spend extended time outdoors during the hours around noon without extensive sun protection, especially if you're traveling in the tropics.  Use any shade available.  Plan outdoor activities (with protection) such as swimming or boating if at all possible in the early morning or late afternoon.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Sun Lotion"]},"\n\nApplying sun lotions is better than nothing, but bear in mind that even the highest factor sun lotions only provide partial UV-protection (despite labels claiming \"full UVA\/B effectiveness\"), and none are suitable alone for prolonged (2 hours+) exposure to strong sunlight.\n\nLotions are rated by SPF, sun protection factor, a measure of how much they reduce burning. For example, if you would burn in ten minutes without protection then with SPF 15 you should be able to go 150 minutes before burning sets in. This is not exact, the effectiveness varies with how thickly the stuff is applied, different countries have different standards for SPF labelling, and the SPF rating generally ignores UV-A radiation which does not cause reddening or pain but may cause other damage. Recent research indicates sun protection factors (SPFs) well above 30 provide little more protection than 30.  New FDA standards are to soon be issued (ca Winter 2012) for labeling preparations to better describe what protection they actually offer.\n\nSun lotions should be thoroughly applied where clothing isn't possible or practicable, e.g., on the back of your hands, or on any exposed skin while you are in the water.  The tops and bottoms of feet and back of knees can burn surprisingly fast.  To work effectively, preparations need to be reapplied every 2 hours or less, again when in the water or where perspiring.  Make sure whatever preparation you use is \"fresh\".  Even the best formulas begin to lose effectiveness after more than a year.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Treatment"]},"\n\nWhen seriously burned, try to see a doctor as soon as possible.\n\nDiving into open water to cool off won't help with the burn, and your skin will continue to get damage.  Beware of infection if your skin is blistering. Take a cool shower (not cold) or a bath. Avoid scrubbing and shaving, use soft towels to dry yourself.\n\nGet a commercially prepared sunburn cream or Aloe Vera to relieve the immediate symptoms.\n\nGet as much ",{"type":"'''","value":["rest"]}," as you can and ",{"type":"'''","value":["drink"]}," lots of water to prevent dehydration. And stay out of the sun until your skin has recovered - which can often take a week or so.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Heat stroke"]},"\nSunstroke or heat prostration is a serious life-threatening condition which occurs when the body can no longer control its temperature; body heat rises and the victim becomes extremely ill.\n\nHigh temperature is a major factor in this, of course. Humidity is also very important; when the humidity is high, water evaporates more slowly and the body's normal method of cooling itself by sweating is much less effective. Dehydration can contribute to the problem by making you sweat less; you should always drink lots of water when it is hot. Any physical exertion adds to the problem.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["PartOfTopic"],["Stay healthy"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["guidetopic"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Sunburn"]]}]
