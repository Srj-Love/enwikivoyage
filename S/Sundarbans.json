Over 120 species of fish and over 260 species of birds have been recorded in the Sundarbans. The Gangetic River Dolphin (Platanista gangeticus) is common in the rivers. No less than 50 species of reptiles and eight species of amphibians are known to occur. The Sundarbans now support the only population of the Estuarine, or Salt-Water Crocodile (Crocodylus parasus) in Bangladesh, and that population is estimated at less than two hundred individuals.\n\nThe park is also home to sea gypsy fishing families who catch fish using trained otters.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" October to February — winter, cool and temperate"]},{"type":"*","value":[" March to May — summer, hot and humid"]},{"type":"*","value":[" June to September — the monsoon season, wet and windy"]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Safaris"]}," are available from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dhaka"]]},",",{"type":"[[","value":[["Khulna"]]}," .

After negotiating the price of a boat down to something only slightly less ridiculous you'll most likely be taken to Karamjal Wildlife Center, where there are some tame deer to feed and some monkeys, crocs and snakes in cages. But surely you didn't come all this way to see a rundown zoo filled with depressed animals and raucous Bangladeshis.

The Sundarbans is well known as the only place left where Bengal Tigers still hunt and kill humans, and they do it regularly. That being said, these victims are always locals who live within the Sundarbans and rely on it for survival, hence there is a \"live and let live\" policy between man and tiger. Saltwater Crocodiles also inhabit the Sundarbans and are well known to be the largest and (along with the Nile Crocodile) most aggressive reptile on Earth. In the Sundarbans you are unlikely to be in crocodile territory without a large boat, so the risk is minimal. As you can see, while living in the Sundarbans is extremely dangerous, very little risk is posed to the average tourist. Snakes exist, but are primarily either shy or nocturnal, unless you plan on venturing off into the bush alone you don't have much to worry about.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\n\nAs with the rest of tropical Asia, mosquito-borne diseases including (but not limited to) Malaria and Dengue Fever are present within the Sundarbans at varying levels dependent on the season (the Wet season representing the greatest risk.) It is important to note that the most feared animal (by both locals and tourists) within the tropics is the mosquito and represents a greater threat than any man-eater could. Also, as with any rural part of India, drinking water should be limited to bottled only and always use your best judgment when choosing what to eat.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["21.9333"],["88.8500"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Khulna Division"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinepark"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Sundarbans"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Commons:Category:Sundarbans"]]}]
