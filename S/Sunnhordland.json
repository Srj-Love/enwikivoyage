Folgefonna – Norway’s third largest glacier — is the icing on the cake. In Sunnhordland you can ski on eternal snow, swim in the sea, and fish a pollock in the fjord – everything in one day.\n\nSunnhordland has some of the finest and most distinctive scenery in Norway. In the outermost part of the region,\nthe landscape is dominated by the ocean and the coastline. As you move further inland, you come to islands and fjords. There are thousands of large and small islands in the region. Norway’s second longest fjord – the 179-km-long Hardangerfjord, called ”Queen of the Norwegian fjords” – starts in Sunnhordland. Furthest inland in the region, the mighty Sunnhordland mountains tower heavenwards, with some peaks as tall as 1700 metres. The mountains surround Norway’s third largest glacier – Folgefonna. This magnificent glacier is `spread' over the mountains of the Folgefonna peninsula like the icing on a cake. Some of Norway’s most spectacular waterfalls cascade down the mountainsides. Folgefonna National Park, the 25th national park in Norway, was opened in the summer of 2005.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History and culture"]},"\nSunnhordland was one of the first areas to be settled in Norway thousands of years ago, and up through the ages the area has had a special place in the country’s history. That is why Sunnhordland is one of the areas with many ancient monuments and a rich cultural heritage.\n\nGiven its central location, it was almost inevitable that Sunnhordland would come to occupy a prominent place during the Viking era. The region became a central base for Viking chieftains who often went raiding in the west. There are many places, therefore, where relics of this era can be seen. The aristocracy subsequently made their presence felt and the building of the\nBarony Rosendal was completed in 1665 – the only one of its kind in Norway.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Fishing, hunting, and boating"]},"\nSunnhordland's inhabitants have shown great prowess in fishing and hunting.
