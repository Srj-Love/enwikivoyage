Stretching for nearly 70 klms, the Sunshine Coast falls within the Sunshine Coast Council's jurisdiction and provides for a great (and popular) escape from Brisbane, or the Gold Coast. A holiday mecca even for South East Queensland locals, the Sunshine Coast is a great place to relax, unwind and taste the amazing local produce.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nThe Glass House Mountains were sighted by Captain James Cook from the deck of the ",{"type":"''","value":["HM Endeavour"]}," in 1770.\n\nMany of the Sunshine Coast's towns began as simple ports and jetties for timber industry during the 1860s and 1870s, as the area once had magnificent stands of forest. Likewise, the region's road biggen snigging tracks for hauling timber. Timbergetters used the region's creeks, rivers and lakes as seaways to float out their logs of cedar - the resultant wood being shipped far afield as Europe.\n\nToday, the Sunshine Coast is one of the fastest growing regions in Australia. As the region became increasingly residential, most of the district's small farms, especially tropical farms have now disappeared. Instead business concerned with retail, catering and tourism have now assumed increasing importance.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\n\nThe Sunshine Coast is between 1 and 2 hours (depending on traffic and exactly where you're going) north of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brisbane"]]}," by car. \n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Sunshine Coast Airport"]}," \n\nSunshine Coast Airport is 10km north of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Maroochydore"]]}," and has daily flights to ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sydney"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Melbourne"]]},".  The airport has good facilities for an airport of its size, with multiple ATMs, rental cars, transfer services, and food and shopping outlets.\n\nThere is a small cafe in the arrivals area, selling coffee and snacks, open from the first flight to the last.  Most of the facilities are located after clearing security in the departures area, there is a cafe, a salad store, jewellery store, bookstore and a bar.  There is an outside area next to the tarmac which can be an area to enjoy a drink while waiting for your flight.\n\nThe Translink (Sunbus) 622 bus services the airport terminal hourly between Maroochydore and Noosa Junction, but somewhat inconveniently stops before the last flights arrive from Sydney and Melbourne.  The 620 bus runs later and with greater frequency, but only stops on David Low Way outside the airport precinct.  It is just over 1 kilometre to walk from this stop to the airport terminal, simply walk along the Friendship Drive out of the airport, turn right onto David Low way and walk the short distance to the stop.  Change at Sunshine Plaza in Maroochydore for points south.  Change at Noosa Junction for Noosa Heads and Noosaville.\n\nThe hire car chains are located in arrivals.\n\nDoor to door transfers are available to the entire sunshine coast area, but should be pre-booked.  Henry's operates north (to Noosa and Coolum), and Sun-air operates south to Maroochydore, Caloundra.  Discounts are available for groups - expect to pay around $20 per person.  If you haven't prebooked, Henry's has a desk inside the arrivals area, where you can see if there is availability on the next shuttle.  Sun-air has no presence at the airport, and you'll have to call them to see if you can arrange a pickup.\n\nSunshine Coast taxis Taxis are available and operated by Suncoast cabs (131 008).  It can cost up to $100 to get to Noosa by taxi from the airport, so if you are heading a distance from the airport make sure you have determined your onward transport before arriving.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Brisbane airport "]},"\n\nSee the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Brisbane#Get in"],["Brisbane guide"]]}," for how to get to Brisbane airport.  Flights to Brisbane may be more convenient for those who don't want to connect through Sydney or Melbourne to get to the Sunshine Coast.  Transfers are available with Sun-air Pick Me up Airport Transfers to the Sunshine Coast.  Cost is around $40.\n\nPublic transport is possible, but to many points on the Sunshine Coast will involve a very circuitous route, and cost $30 or more.
