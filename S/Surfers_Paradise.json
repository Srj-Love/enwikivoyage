Set on miles of ocean surf beach, ",{"type":"''","value":["Surfers"]}," has more going on than just the waves.  From the high rise apartments that line the shore, to the nightclubs, pubs and late night shopping lining the mall, Surfers is busy all through the day and night. \n\nIt is a site of near-pilgrimage to many Australian teens.  It's a destination for New Zealanders, with direct flights bringing frozen Kiwis to defrost on the golden beaches, and an attraction for travellers from around the world.\n\nMany believe that Surfers Paradise has been over-commercialised, and there is certainly intense high-rise development.  The area has a reputation for rip-off shopping, timeshare salespeople, and seedy strip clubs (which are plentiful).  The beaches and the rest of Surfers sit in the long shadows of the high rises in the late afternoon.\n\nLove the beaches, or hate the kitsch.

It is a huge party - but if drunken teenagers aren't your scene then this is a time to avoid. Indeed it is probably advisable for any males who are not drunken teenagers to avoid the area-you may find yourself facing allegations of being a \"Toolie\" or to put a more finer point on it-somebody looking to take advantage of the younger, drunken women there.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\nSee the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gold Coast#Get in"],["Gold Coast guide"]]}," for information on how to Get in to the area.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nSurfers Paradise itself is quite compact, and you walk between much of the Surfers accommodation, Cavill Mall, and the beaches.
