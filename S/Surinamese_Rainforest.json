It comprises more than 1.6 million hectares of primary tropical forest. The Reserve forms a corridor linking the three most important protected areas in central Suriname: the Raleighvallen Nature reserve in the north, and the Tafelberg and Eilerts de Hann Gebergte Nature Reserves in the central and southern portion of the corridor. The area —an area the size of New Jersey— protects the watershed of one of Suriname's most important river systems, the Coppename River, where there are countless varieties of flora and fauna, many of them endemic. The Raleighvallen Nature Reserve is one of the most important protected areas in South America. Vegetation there consists mostly of moist highland forest, the same forest that covers approximately 80 percent of Suriname. The Tafelberg Nature Reserve is in a remote area that includes the geographic centre of Suriname. This area is made up of primary rainforest and savannah ecosystems. The Eilerts de Hann Gebergte Nature Reserve has no human populations living within or around its boundaries. This reserve includes parts of the Eilerts de Hann Gebergte mountain range and is made up of primary tropical rain forest and savannah ecosystems. Since there has been very little exploration in this Reserve, very little is known about is flora and fauna. The Central Suriname Nature Reserve is an important precedent in protecting large blocks of undisturbed tropical wilderness. But it is only a first step. The challenge for Conservation International and its funding partners is to continue these efforts to protect the ecological viability of the world's last remaining tropical wilderness areas. Conservation International has been active in Suriname since 1991, using an integrated approach that draws on both the knowledge and expertise of highly trained Surinamese conservationists as well as CI's on-the-ground experience in twenty-two other countries of the world. \n\nRather than sell the country's forests to the highest-bidding timber companies, the Surinamese government made a commitment in 1998 to protect the forests and explore the long-term economic benefits of sustainable development and ecotourism. Conservation International (CI) joined Suriname to help design, fund, and promote this effort to carefully blend biodiversity conservation and economic opportunity.\n\nSeven years later, the uniquely constructed tourist facilities on Foengoe Island—tucked neatly within the CSNR—are poised to become a premier destination for ecotourism in the Guiana Shield, the massive, two billion-year-old geological formation that underlies five countries in northeastern South America.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Colakreek"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Colakreek.jpg"],["thumb"],["Colakreek"]]},"\nSomewhat identical to the Suriname River resorts ",{"type":"'''","value":["White Beach"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["Overbridge"]}," is ",{"type":"'''","value":["Colakreek"]},".

In this part of Suriname malaria occurs, although it was last reported in 2005. However, it is advisable to use malaria pills. Malaria mosquitoes bite mainly in the evening, at night and in the early morning. Dengue mosquitoes bite also during the day. Risks are reduced by wearing long sleeves and trousers. An insect repellent containing DEET is recommended, as well as the use of a mosquito net at night. Lodges where mosquitoes are common often (but not always) have mosquito nets available, but especially when travelling individually, bring your own. In case of fever during or after a stay always visit a doctor within 24 hours and don't use ibuprofen based pain killers: paracetamol is okay.\n\nThe water level and the force of the flow depend on the season.
