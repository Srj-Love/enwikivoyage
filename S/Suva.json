Suva became the capital of Fiji in 1877. Fiji's tallest building, the Reserve Bank of Fiji Building, is in downtown Suva, also known as the Central Business District (CBD).\n\nThe Fiji School of Medicine and one of the three campuses of the University of the South Pacific are in Suva.\n\nSuva tends to be the major commercial and political centre of Fiji, whereas ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Nadi"]]}," is the major tourist centre.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nSuva is accessible by airplane, bus, car and boat.  \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]}," \n",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.fijiairways.com\/ Fiji Airways"]}," (Fiji majority owned) provides national and international flights to Suva.\n\nThe closest airport is the Nausori International Airport (",{"type":"{{","value":[["IATA"],["SUV"]]},"), located about 23 kilometers (30 minute drive) away, in Nausori.  Although Nausori International Airport caters mostly to the domestic market, connecting Suva with Fiji's other international airport in Nadi, it also serves some smaller international aircraft.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus and car"]}," \nBusses connect Suva to all major cities in Viti Levu.  People can take normal busses or mini-busses.  Tourists are strongly not advised to use the mini-busses.\n\nThree major roads exit Suva and lead to different parts of Viti Levu.  Kings Highway leads east from Suva; the next major towns to the east are Nausori and Korovou. Queens Highway leads west from Suva, passing Lami; the next major towns to the west are Navua, Pacific Harbor, and Sigatoka. Princes Highway goes north from Suva, through Colo-i-Suva Forest Park, and eventually connects to Kings Highway in Nausori at the Rewa Bridge, the longest bridge in Fiji and the longest bridge of its type in the South Pacific.\n\nSuva is one of Fiji's major harbors and is home to a fishing fleet and major port.  Cruise ships also stop in Suva.  Several boat companies cooperate with bus companies to permit travelers to visit other islands by taking a bus from Suva, using a roll-on\/roll-off (or RO-RO) ferry, and continuing to the town destination on the island.  One example if this bus\/boat combination is the trip from Suva to Levuka (Fiji's former capitol) on the island of Ovalau.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nTourists and residents often use taxis as they are affordable, plentiful and easy to access.\nPeople can also take a bus to travel around Suva and to major cities and towns for an even more affordable price.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["see"],["name=Fiji Museum"],["url=http:\/\/www.fijimuseum.org.fj\/"],["email="],["address=PO Box 2023 Govt Bldgs"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=(679) 331 5944\/ (679) 331 5043"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=$7 FJ"],["content=The Fiji Museum is an excellent place for tourists to understand the historical background of Fiji.

Rugby matches are most often held in Albert Park, across from the Suva Lawn Bowls club.  Soccer matches are often in the National Stadium on Laucala Bay Road.

For  a quick economical meal in pleasant surroundings, go to the food court upstairs at the Harbour Centre and choose from a great variety of local and Chinese dishes (and you get to look before you buy) and sit and enjoy the view, or get a sack of fish and chips and sit by the waterfront or at the botanical garden.\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["eat"],["name=Singh's Curry House"],["url="],["email="],["address=Corner of Gordon Street & Victoria Parade, Suva"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone="],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Sells cheap and delicious authentic Fijian curry.
