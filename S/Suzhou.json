",{"type":"[[","value":[["Pickpocketing"]]}," is common on crowded buses around the north bus station and the train station.  Pan-handlers and beggars around the old town can become a real nuisance although they are not dangerous.  Watch out for incredibly pushy hawkers operating on Guanqian Jie shopping street - they generally charge ridiculous prices for counterfeit goods.\n\nTaxis are generally safe although it's advisable not to follow touts operating around tourist sights or the train station. Also be aware that pedicab and 3-wheel tuk-tuk drivers are known to overcharge.\n\nProbably the biggest safety risk in Suzhou are the ",{"type":"'''","value":["electric scooters"]},". These cheap, plastic, battery powered 2-wheel vehicles swarm around the city like ninjas and are renowned for driving anywhere possible - the wrong side of the road, the pavement, tiny alleyways and across crowded pedestrian crossings. They are almost silent and riders generally don't use headlights at night to save battery power - the only giveaway is their squeaky electric horns. Don't be surprised when you're walking down a busy pavement and one of these pocket-rockets whizzes past at 50 km\/h without warning so always keep an eye and an ear out for them, particularly at night and at rush hour when the designated bike lanes become too crowded so the riders take alternate means.\n\nRemember that in China it's legal for car drivers to make a right turn against a red light - albeit they ignore the latter part of the rule 'turn with caution' - it's all too common for cars, and more notoriously, trucks, to fly round an intersection too fast and unfortunately accidents involving pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists are too common. Always keep an eye out in both directions when crossing the street.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Suzhou skyline.JPG"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Breathing may be difficult for some travelers"]]},"\n\nSome travelers may need to worry about the air quality in Suzhou, although the problem is not as bad as in nearby Shanghai or Nanjing.\n\nAs is the case for most of China, the tap water is not recommended for drinking but OK for washing. Filtered and boiled tap water is considered safer for drinking.\n\nAs Suzhou is a water town, there is a high presence of mosquitoes in the summer; luckily, repellant can be found in every convenience store and they don't carry any known diseases in this area, so they're more of an annoyance than a hazard.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\nSuzhou has many free Wi-Fi access points as well as pay (¥2.5 per hour) Internet cafes.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Internet cafes"]},"\nThe biggest concentration of Internet cafes are located along Moye Road just east of Shiquan Street. Most are about ¥2.50 per hour and have fast internet, headphones, webcam, etc., and also serve hot and cold drinks and cigarettes (smoking is permitted inside). Chinese customers will use their ID card to access the computer; foreigners should either bring their passport to register onto the computer, although if this facility is not provided the cashier will use his\/her card to sign you in. However, police will occasionally check, in which case it may be harder for you to use.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Wi-Fi cafes"]},"\n\nThe large coffe chains like New Island Cafe, Starbucks and Costa Coffee all have several branches in Suzhou, all offering free Wi-Fi.

Day trips to the lake are possible going straight west from Suzhou or going via towns which are right on the lake, Wuxi to the north or the Suzhou suburb ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wujiang"]]}," to the south. Longer trips are also possible; see the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lake Tai"]]}," article. \n\nThe whole region around Suzhou is flat Yangtze Delta terrain and has ",{"type":"'''","value":["water towns"]},", once the market towns for agricultural areas. All have picturesque canals with old houses along them and many bridges, and many are set up to accommodate tourists. Suzhou itself is very much a water town, and some travellers will find that enough. However, smaller places may be more picturesque or better preserved. Many agencies in Suzhou offer tours to some of these — especially to ones within Suzhou such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zhouzhuang"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tongli"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zhen Ze"]]},". All are within an hour's travel of central Suzhou, and these tours are quite popular.\n\nAnother water town, Mudu, can easily be visited without taking a tour since it is the last stop going west on Metro Line 1. It is reportedly a bit shabby, not as pretty or developed as some of the others, but this may change now that it is more accessible.\n\nSee also our lists of water towns ",{"type":"[[","value":[["East_China#Other_destinations"],["in East China"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Shanghai#Water_towns"],["within Shanghai"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Jiangsu"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["guidecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["31.30232"],["120.62147"],["zoom=11"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wikipedia:Suzhou"]]}]
