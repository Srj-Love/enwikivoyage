Swahili speakers can also be found in surrounding countries, such as ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Burundi"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Rwanda"]]},", and  ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Mozambique"]]},". While only 5-10 million people speak Swahili as their first language, as a second language, there are over 50 million speakers, making it the most widely spoken African language in the world. As a part of the Bantu language family, Swahili is related to a variety of languages from Southern Africa to Central to West Africa. While some Bantu languages, like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Xhosa phrasebook"],["Xhosa"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Zulu phrasebook"],["Zulu"]]}," are click languages, Swahili does ",{"type":"''","value":["not"]}," use clicks, so pronunciation is generally not difficult for English speakers.\n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Pronunciation guide"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Vowels"]},"\nSwahili has five vowels: a, e, i, o, u. If you are familiar with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Spanish"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Italian"]]}," or ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Japanese"]]},", the vowels are pronounced the same. If not, they are pronounced:\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["A"]}," - ah (Like the \"a\" in \"father\")\n",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["E"]}," - eh (Like the \"a\" in \"say\" but without moving your mouth)\n",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["I"]}," - ee (Like the \"ee\" in \"see\")\n",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["O"]}," - oh (Like the \"o\" in \"so\" but without moving your mouth)\n",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["U"]}," - oo (Like the \"oo\" in \"doom\")\n",{"type":"<","value":["br"]},"\n\nVowels in Swahili always make the same sounds, even when combined with other vowels. There are no silent letters or diphthongs in Swahili, so vowels will always make the same sound, and it is important that you pronounce each vowel, even when one vowel follows another. For example, in the word \"daawa\" (lawsuit), you must say \"dah-ah-wah\", pronouncing ",{"type":"''","value":["both"]}," of the a's. Simply saying \"dah-wah\" (dawa) changes the meaning to \"drug\/medicine\".\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Consonants"]},"\nThe following consonants are pronounced the same as in English:\n\n;b : like the \"b\" in \"bay\"\n;d : like the \"d\" in \"dog\"\n;f : like the \"f\" in \"fun\"\n;g : like the \"g\" in \"gut\"\n;h : like the \"h\" in \"hen\"\n;j : like the \"j\" in \"jam\"\n;k : like the \"k\" in \"kit\"\n;l : like the \"l\" in \"lump\"\n;p : like the \"p\" in \"pot\"\n;s : like the \"s\" in \"sun\"\n;t : like the \"t\" in \"tip\"\n;v : like the \"v\" in \"van\"\n;w : like the \"w\" in \"win\"\n;y : like the \"y\" in \"yellow\"\n;z : like the \"z\" in \"zebra\"\n\nOther consonants\n;m : like the \"m\" in \"mop\".\n;n : like the \"n\" in \"numb\"\n\nAlthough \"m\" and \"n\" are pronounced the same in Swahili as they are in English, unlike English, these letters can often be found at the beginning of words followed by other consonants, such as \"t\", \"d\", etc. Since Swahili has no silent letters, it is important to pronounce these sounds. So for words like \"Mchana\" (afternoon) and \"Ndugu\" (sibling\/relative), you need to pronounce the \"m\" and \"n\" sounds along with the following consonant sounds.\n\n;r : The \"r\" sound is not pronounced as it is in English. Actually, like the vowels, the \"r\" sound is the same as Spanish and Japanese; a soft \"r\" that sometimes sounds like a \"d\".\n\n\n",{"type":"====","value":["Consonant pairings"]},"\n;ch : like the \"ch\" in \"chat\"\n;ng : like the \"ng\" in \"sing\"\n;ny : like the \"ni\" in \"onion\"\n;gh : officially pronounced similiar to the \"ch\" in \"loch\", you can alternatively just pronounce it with a hard \"g\", like the \"g\" in \"gut\" (as mentioned above)\n;sh : like the \"sh\" in \"dash\"\n;th : like the \"th\" in \"thank\". It is ",{"type":"'''","value":["never"]}," pronounced like the \"th\" in \"those\". That \"th\" is spelled \"dh\" in Swahili.\n;dh : like the \"th\" in \"the\".

Daytime revolves around the rising and setting of the sun, which typically begins to rise around 7 AM and set at 7 PM in the areas where Swahili is spoken. For English speakers, this can be confusing; however, those who learn how to tell time in Swahili will admit that it is more logical than the English system, in which midnight is considered \"morning\", even though no one begins their day at midnight.\n\nSo, to say the time in Swahili, you need to add (or subtract) 6 from the English time. 7:00 in America will be expressed as the ",{"type":"''","value":["first hour"]}," (1:00) in Swahili. AM is expressed with ",{"type":"''","value":["asubuhi"]}," (morning) and PM is typically marked with ",{"type":"''","value":["usiku"]}," (night). Because the daytime begins at 7 AM, hours from midnight to 6 AM will be expressed with ",{"type":"''","value":["usiku"]},", as these are nighttime hours in Swahili.
