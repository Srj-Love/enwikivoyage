It was during the industrial revolution, however, that the city flourished and its population grew. The city is home to the world's first passenger railway service known as the Mumbles Train, which bumped and bounced along five miles of Swansea foreshore, linking the city centre with the suburb of Mumbles. Much of the city centre's architectural heritage was lost through wartime bombing. However, the abundance of parks, stunning coastal scenery, lovely water-side suburbs, a magnificent bay-side maritime quarter, varied cultural events, medieval castles and golden sandy beaches have preserved Swansea's place as a major tourist destination. Furthermore, according to a survey conducted by an international health magazine that considered, among other factors, a city's crime rate, life-style, environment etc, Swansea was judged to be the most relaxed city in the UK, while two national surveys have ranked the city as the third friendliest place in the country with regard to customer service and the safest urban area in the UK. Citizens from Wales' second city are known as 'Swansea Jacks,' and the name 'Swansea' is derived from 'Sweyn's-ey,' the Scandinavian name for the original settlement.\n\nDylan Thomas was passionate about Swansea, and in his early days described it as an \"ugly, lovely town, crawling, sprawling, slummed, unplanned, jerry-villa'd, and smug-suburbed by the side of a long and splendid curving shore.\" Later, he referred to it as \"the most romantic town I know,\" and  described it with great gusto as a \"marble town, city of laughter, little Dublin\" and screamed triumphantly \"Never was there such a town!\"\n\nIncidentally, the Swansea seaside resort of ",{"type":"'''","value":["Mumbles"]}," derives its name from the French word ",{"type":"''","value":["mamelles"]},", meaning \"breasts\"; take a look at the two islets off Mumbles Head from across the bay, and it is easy to see why.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Climate"],["units = Metric"],["janhigh =  6"],["febhigh =  6"],["marhigh =  9"],["aprhigh =  11"],["mayhigh =  15"],["junhigh =  17"],["julhigh =  20"],["aughigh =  20"],["sephigh =  16"],["octhigh =  13"],["novhigh =  10"],["dechigh =  10"],["janlow =  4"],["feblow =  4"],["marlow =  7"],["aprlow =  8"],["maylow =  12"],["junlow =  14"],["jullow =  17"],["auglow =  17"],["seplow =  13"],["octlow =  11"],["novlow =  8"],["declow =  8"],["janprecip =  71"],["febprecip =  52"],["marprecip =  45"],["aprprecip =  49"],["mayprecip =  36"],["junprecip =  42"],["julprecip =  41"],["augprecip =  50"],["sepprecip =  55"],["octprecip =  81"],["novprecip =  71"],["decprecip =  71"],["description = ",{"type":"'''","value":["Met office five day forecast for Swansea"]},": ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.metoffice.gov.uk\/weather\/uk\/wl\/swansea_forecast_weather.html"]}]]},"\nSwansea has a wet and mild climate, with winter temperatures ranging from around 4 to 6°C, while the summer average high is about 20°C but often reaching to 26 or 27°C. Sun lovers should visit Swansea from June to August, which is the period that records the most hours of sunshine and is the main tourist season. However, those who prefer long solitary walks along cliffs paths or contemplative strolls through wooded valleys should consider September and October. During these months, the air is crisp and fresh and the area quiet, with most tourists having already departed. However, as Wales is one of the wettest areas in the UK, you should always prepare for rain when visiting the region.
