Exit the M4 Motorway at Junction 43 and on the roundabout head onto the A465 road.  The A465 is known locally as the Heads of Valleys Road.  Once past neath, the road heads up the beautiful Vale of Neath with a wide valley floor with lakes flanked by steep wooded hills on both sides.  At Hirwaun, head onto the A4059, which leads to a gentle climb into the central Brecon Beacons.  Once in the mountains, the A4059 becomes a twisty country road with lots of sweeping ups and downs.  Beware of sheep crossing the road in this section.  The A4059 descends and meets the A470.  Head north on the A470.  The A470 passes by the western tip of ridge line which includes Pen-y-Fan (the highest peak in south Wales).  Further north, the A470 crosses the side of a deep U-shaped valley. Head onto the A40 westwards at Brecon.  Then at Sennybridge, head onto the A4067 (known as the Swansea Valley Road).  The road passes scenic spots like the Cray reservoir and continues all the way to Swansea where the M4 can be re-joined at Junction 45.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Golf"]},"\nSwansea Bay has a number of excellent golf courses, many with spectacular sea views:\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Ashburnham Golf Club"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.ashburnhamgolfclub.co.uk\/"],["email="],["address=Cliffe Terrace, Burry Port"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone =+44 1554 833846"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content= 18 hole links course"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Carmarthen Golf Club"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.carmarthengolfclub.co.uk"],["email="],["address=Blaenycoed Road, Carmarthen, SA336EH"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone =+44 1267 281588"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content= 18 hole par 71 course."]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Clyne Golf Club"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.clynegolfclub.com\/"],["email="],["address=118-120 Owls Lodge Lane"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone =+44 1792 401989"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Mayals, Swansea., 6323 yard 18 hole course built on moorland, par 70 sss72"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Fairwood Park Golf Club"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.fairwoodpark.com\/"],["email="],["address=Blackhills Lane, Upper Killay, Swansea"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone =+44 1792 297849"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content= 6,658 yard 18 hole parkland championship course"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Parc Garnant Golf"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.parcgarnantgolf.co.uk\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone =+44 1269 823365"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Dinefwr Road, Garnant, Ammanford. 6575 yard 18 hole course"]]}]},{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["do"],["name=Glyn Abbey Golf Club"],["alt="],["url=http:\/\/www.glynabbey.co.uk\/"],["email="],["address="],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone =+44 1554 810278"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price="],["content=Trimsaran, Kidwelly, Carmarthenshire.
