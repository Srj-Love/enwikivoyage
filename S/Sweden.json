King Gustav Vasa ascended as King of Sweden in 1523, and is regarded as the founder of modern Sweden. He also reformed the church to Lutheran-Protestant. Today's Sweden is a secular state with very few church-goers.\n\nDuring the 17th century Sweden rose as a Great Power, through several successful wars, annexing ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Scania"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Halland"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bohuslän"]]}," from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Denmark"]]},", as well as temporary possessions in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Baltic countries"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["northern Germany"]]},". However, the country has now been at peace since 1814; having long remained outside military alliances (including both World Wars), the country has a high peace profile, with internationally renowned names such as Raoul Wallenberg, Dag Hammarskjöld, Olof Palme and Hans Blix. Sweden is a monarchy by constitution, but king Carl XVI Gustaf has no executive power.\n\nSweden is a developed post-industrial society with an advanced welfare state. The standard of living and life expectancy rank among the highest in the world. Sweden joined the European Union in 1995, but decided by a referendum in 2003 not to commit to the European Monetary Union and the euro currency. Leadership of Sweden has for the larger part of the 20th century been dominated by the Social Democratic Party, which started out at the end of the 19th century as a labor movement. Since the 2006 election, a coalition of centre-right liberal\/conservative parties hold the power.\n\nSweden has a strong tradition of being an open, yet discreet country. Citizens sometimes appear to be quite reserved at first, but once they get to know who they are dealing with, they'll be as warm and friendly as you'd wish. Privacy is regarded as a key item and many visitors, for example mega-stars in various lines of trade, have many times realized that they mostly can walk the streets of the cities virtually undisturbed.\n\nSweden houses the Nobel Prize committee for all the prizes except the peace prize which is hosted in Oslo, a memento of the Swedish-Norwegian union that was dissolved in 1905.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["The year in Sweden"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Gävle goat on December 21, 2009.jpg"],["thumb"],["The ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gävle"]]}," Goat, a Christmas decoration known to be targeted by arsonists."]]},"\nWeather in Sweden is typically ",{"type":"[[","value":[["cold weather"],["cold"]]}," from October to April, but in the summer (late May to early September) temperature lies around 20 degrees C.

In Stockholm, the sun sets at 15:00 in December. North of the Arctic Circle one can experience the midnight sun and Arctic night. However, even at Stockholm's latitude, summer nights exist only in the form of prolonged twilight during June and July.\n\nThe major holidays are Easter (",{"type":"''","value":["påsk"]},"), Midsummer (",{"type":"''","value":["midsommar"]},", celebrated from the eve of the Friday between June 19–25), Christmas (",{"type":"''","value":["jul"]},", Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing Day are all considered holidays), and the \"industrial vacation\" throughout July.

You may have some trouble finding them, unless you go to a bar specialized in providing uncommon beer, or one of the well stocked ",{"type":"''","value":["Systembolaget"]},", but you will find a few of them in every major city. Despite this the most common beer is the rather plain \"international lager\". The beer you get in normal food shops is called ",{"type":"''","value":["folköl"]}," and has 2.8 or 3.5% alcohol. You are able to find a variety of different brands of beers in food stores, Swedish, English and even Czech beer. Sweden has a seasonal beer for Christmas, ",{"type":"''","value":["julöl"]},". It is sweeter than normal beer and usually seasoned with Christmas spices, mostly it is of the beer type ale. All Swedish breweries make at least one type of julöl. Wine is popular, but the Swedish production is very modest.\n\nDrinking alcohol in parks and public areas is generally allowed, if notifications don't state the opposite. Drinking at public transport stations or on board is prohibited, with the exception of trains or boats serving alcohol in a bar.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Systembolaget"]},"\nBeer and lager up to 3.5% ABV is readily available in supermarkets at 10-15 SEK a piece, but strong alcoholic beverages are, as in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Norway"]]},", ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Finland"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Iceland"]]}," available over the counter only from the state-owned retailer, ",{"type":"'''","value":[{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.systembolaget.se\/Applikationer\/Knappar\/InEnglish\/ Systembolaget"]}]}," (also sometimes referred to as ",{"type":"''","value":["Systemet"]}," or ",{"type":"''","value":["Bolaget"]},"). They are usually open 10:00-18:00 Mon-Wed, 10:00-19:00 Thurs-Fri, and 10:00-15:00 on Saturdays, with long queues on Fridays and Saturdays, closing at the minute no matter how long the queue outside the store is, something the Swedes themselves joke about. They are always closed on Sundays. Most shops are of supermarket style. The assortment is very good, and the staff usually has great knowledge. Systembolaget does not serve customers under the age of 20 and will most likely ask for identification from younger looking customers. This also applies to any companions, regardless of who is making the actual purchase.\n\nBeverages are heavily taxed by content of alcohol, some liquor is very expensive (vodka is around 300 SEK a liter at Systembolaget), but the monopoly has brought some perks - Systembolaget is one of the world's largest bulk-buyers of wine, and as such gets some fantastic deals which it passes on to consumers. Mid-to-high-quality wines often cost less in Sweden than in the country of origin; sometimes even less than if you were to buy the wine directly from the vineyard. This does ",{"type":"'''","value":["not"]}," apply to low-quality wines or hard liquor, due to the volume-based tax on alcohol.\n\nAll brands are treated equally and there is no large-pack discount. Therefore, microbrews cost largely the same as major brands, and might be a more interesting choice. Beverages are not refrigerated. Drinking alcohol in public is usually allowed, with a few restrictions, such as shopping centres, playgrounds and public transport areas.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Bars and nightclubs"]},"\nThe minimum age requirement is 18 to get into bars and to buy regular (3.5% ABV or less) beer in shops (to prevent teenage drunkenness, some shops have decided to enforce a minimum age of 20 for 3.5% beer as well), and 20 in Systembolaget. Many bars have an age limit of 20, but some (especially downtown on weekends) have age limits as high as 23 or 25, but this rule is arbitrarily enforced. Bring passport or ID.\n\nSome posh clubs mandate dress code, ",{"type":"''","value":["vårdad klädsel"]}," is casual dress; this is also arbitrarily enforced. For male guests, proper shoes (not sneakers or sandals), long-legged trousers (not blue jeans) and a dress shirt is almost always good enough.\n\nAge or dress rules are not rigid, and doormen have the right to accept or reject any patron for any reason other than gender, sexual orientation, creed, disability or race. Though illegal, a few nightclubs are infamous for rejecting \"immigrants\", which usually means anyone with hair and skin darker than the average Swede, on pretexts such as \"members only\", \"too drunk\", or \"dress code\"; men of Middle Eastern or African origin are most often subjected to this. You might avoid this problem by dressing properly, behaving well and arriving fairly early. Don't argue with the guard, they are infamous for violence.\n\nSweden has enforced ",{"type":"'''","value":["non-smoking"]}," in all bars, pubs and restaurants, save outdoor areas such as terraces, and designated smoking rooms (where drinks are not allowed).\n\nThe prices at clubs and bars are often expensive compared to other countries: a large beer (4 dl) usually costs 45-60 SEK (~), but many low-profile bars advertise ",{"type":"''","value":["stor stark"]}," (0.4 L of draft lager) for as little as 25 SEK early evenings. A long drink costs around 60-110 SEK. For that reason many Swedes have a small pre-party (\"förfest\") before they go out to get buzzed before they hit the town and go to nightclubs.\n\nLarge clubs can require a cover charge, usually about 100 SEK (or more at special performances). They usually offer a rubber stamp on your hand so you can re-enter as you like without having to pay again.\n\nBe aware that you often have to stand in line to get into a bar or a club. Many places deliberately make their customers wait in line for a while, since a long queue indicates a popular club. At the very fanciest places in the major cities, the queue is often replaced by a disorganized crowd, and the doorman simply points to indicate who gets in and who does not (to be sure to get in either be famous, very good-looking or a friend of the doorman. Or simply a regular).\n\nMost bars that close at 01:00 or earlier, will have a free entry policy.  Most bars and clubs that remain open until 03:00 will charge an entrance fee. There are some clubs in the largest cities that remain open until 05:00. Their entrance fee will usually be around 200 SEK (~) and their entry policy will generally weigh less favourably for the non-rich, non-well-moisturised, non-Swedes, non-friends and non-regulars.\n\nThe club's wardrobe (or coat-checking) fee is often mandatory, usually around 20 SEK.\n\nAuthorized security guards carry a badge saying ",{"type":"''","value":["Ordningsvakt"]},".

Swedes, foreign citizens already living in Sweden, and EU\/EEA citizens have preference over others in obtaining work in Sweden.

They often didn't get paid what they were promised and had costs they didn't expect, so they often didn't earn enough to pay the loan used to pay the plane ticket. On the paper everyone should be paid minimum 85 SEK (60 after tax deduction) per hour, also foreign temporary workers, otherwise there will be no work permit. But often they still make much less, otherwise Swedes would get the job.

Use common sense at night, particularly on weekend nights when people hit the streets to drink, get drunk, and in some unfortunate cases look for trouble. Mind that it is likely that your home country is less safe than Sweden, so heed whatever warnings you would do in your own country and you will have no worries.\n\nAlthough there is a significant police presence in the city centres, especially on weekend nights, the rest of Sweden is quite weakly policed. This especially applies to Norrland, where the nearest patrol car might be a hundred kilometres away. \n\nDo not argue with security guards or bouncers; they might become upset, and they are legally allowed to use some force when needed.\n\nCarrying a ",{"type":"'''","value":["knife"]}," in public areas is prohibited in Sweden, regardless of size, unless needed for work or other activities.

Most Swedes carry their wallets in their pockets or purses and feel quite safe while doing it. Still, almost all stores and restaurants accept most major credit cards, so there is no need to carry a lot of cash around. If you have a bike, do lock it or you may lose it.\n\nBe sure to watch for cars in the road junctions. There is a law in Sweden called \"The Zebra law\" which means that cars must stop at zebra crossings. Many Swedes believe that all the drivers do that.

In the unlikely event of a brown bear attacking you should play dead, protect your head and make yourself as small as possible. Most attacks are bluffs, though. Bears are most likely to attack if they are injured, provoked by a dog, going to hibernate or protecting their cubs. Bears in Sweden have killed no more than a handful of people since 1900.\n\nWild wolves have not killed a human in Sweden since 1821. Do not try to befriend them, though. Aggressive behaviour is the best defence. Dogs have killed some people in later years however.\n\nThere is one venomous snake in Sweden, the adder, the bites of which are seldom fatal.
