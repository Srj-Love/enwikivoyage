The small hilltop village subsequently expanded around the site of a quarry, with a 19th-century canal facilitating trade.\n \nDuring the mid 19th century, the introduction of the Great Western Railway and the associated railway works fully transformed Swindon from a village into a thriving industrial town, which drew workers from across the United Kingdom.\n \nSwindon experienced a population boom after World War II.  New housing areas were built due to a shortage of housing in London following the mass destruction caused by the war.  This population growth has continued and the town remains one of the fastest growing urban areas in the United Kingdom and Europe.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\nSwindon is served by international airports in the south of the United Kingdom.
