Switzerland remains a safe haven for investors, because it has maintained a degree of bank secrecy and has kept up the franc's long-term external value. Reflecting the anemic economic conditions of Europe, GDP growth dropped in 2001 to about 0.8%, to 0.2% in 2002, and to -0.3% in 2003, with a small rise to 1.8% in 2004-05.

The yellow sheet is for departures and the white sheet is for arrivals.  Faster trains appear on both of these sheets in red, while the trains in black stop at more stations.  For long trips it is often easier to use the website, as it will pick transfers for you.  You need not fear transfers of five minutes or less.  You will make them, provided you know exactly which platform you arrive on and which one you depart from.  Many Swiss commute with a one or two minute transfer! \n\nAt the track, the signs indicate the destination and departure time.  The small numbers and letters along the bottom show you where you can board the train.  The letters indicate the zone you should stand in, and the numbers indicate the class. The class (1st or 2nd) is indicated by a \"1\" or \"2\" on the side of the car, these correspond with the numbers on the sign. All Swiss trains are non-smoking — this is also indicated on the side of car, as well as inside. \n\nLuggage can be stowed above your seat or in between seats, or on a rack at the end of the car.  During busy periods, people often stow large luggage (or skis) in the entrance area in between cars.  This is usually fairly safe, but use common sense.\n\nThe variety of trains is bewildering at first, but is actually quite simple.  The routes the SBB-CFF-FFS website suggests will make much more sense if you understand them.  All trains have a one or two letter prefix, followed by a number, for example RE2709, IR2781.

Two of the best known Swiss dishes, ",{"type":"'''","value":["fondue"]}," and ",{"type":"'''","value":["raclette"]},", are cheese based. Fondue is a pot of melted cheese that you dip a piece of bread into using long forks. Usually fondue is not made of one single type of cheese, but instead many different cheeses are blended. That's the reason why fondue doesn't taste the same all over Switzerland. Raclette is made by heating a large piece of cheese and scraping off the melted cheese which is eaten together with potatoes, ham and vegetables. Another typical dish is ",{"type":"'''","value":["rösti"]},", potato pancakes quite similar to hash browns. Unlike Germany, France and Italy, Switzerland cannot boast a large variety of indigenous meat dishes. Probably the best known meat dishes are the sausage cervelat and the specialty of region around Zürich, Zürcher Geschnetzeltes (sliced meat and mushrooms). \n\nSwiss chocolate is world famous and there is a large range of different chocolate brands. Also, the breakfast dish Müsli comes from Switzerland.\n\nLike most other things, eating out is ",{"type":"'''","value":["expensive"]}," in Switzerland. You can save money by cooking your own food. \n\nAnother way to reduce food costs is to eat in the cafeterias of department stores such as Coop, Migros and Manor. These cafeterias are usually considerably less expensive than stand-alone restaurants. Coop and Manor also offer beer and wine with meals while Migros does not. Smaller department store outlets might not have a cafeteria.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Supermarket Chains"]},"\nSwiss employment law bans working on Sundays, so shops stay closed. An exception is any business in a railway station, which is deemed to be serving travellers and so is exempt. If you want to find an open shop on a Sunday, go to the nearest big railway station. If a business is family-owned, you aren't employing anybody so you can open, hence small shops can also open on Sundays in some cantons.\n\nSwiss supermarkets can be hard to spot in big cities. They often have small entrances, but open out inside, or are located in a basement, leaving the expensive street frontages for other shops. Look for the supermarket logos above entrances between other shops.

Migros stores can be spotted by a big, orange Helvetica letter \"M\" sign.  The number of \"M\" letters indicates the size of the store and the different services available - a single \"M\" is usually a smaller grocery store, a double M (\"MM\") may be larger and sells other goods like clothing, and a MMM is a full department store with household goods and possibly electronics and sporting goods.

Many hotels will request that you fax or email them your credit card information in order to secure a reservation. In general, hotel staff are helpful and competent, and speak English quite well.  \n\nHotel rates in Switzerland can get quite expensive, especially in popular ski resort areas.\n\nAs in most European countries, Switzerland offers a wide range of accommodation possibilities.

Keep in mind, it's much better to speak the local language, so if you can't speak either French, German or Italian, better go for a language course first. There are a few English courses as well, but it will be much easier to go with local language. Also have in mind that if you're a foreigner, and you want to go for popular subjects, you have to pass entry-tests, and it will cost you a lot, not only for university fees, but also for living.\n\nIf you like cheaper learning, go for Migros Klubschule, they offer language courses in almost every language as well as a lot of different courses for many subjects, just have a look on their website ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.klubschule.ch\/"]},".

In these cases you only need a valid passport and have to register with the local administration. The same system applies in general to citizens of the new EU-10 states (Eastern European states in general) plus Bulgaria and Romania but there are limitations on the number of permits. For all other countries in the world the best way is to check with your embassy if there are, for example, exchange programs.\n\nSwitzerland has an unemployment rate of about 2.9% (June 2011). Skilled academics will have good job opportunities.\n\nThe high level of Swiss salaries reflect the high costs of living, so keep in mind that you must spend a lot for accommodation and food, when you negotiate your salary. Still, if you want or have to make money fast, you can save a substantial amount per month while working in a low-paying job. In general, you work 42 hours\/week and have 4 weeks of paid holidays.\n\nSwitzerland has no legal minimum salary. The salary depends on the industry you work in, with most companies paying at least 3500 CHF per month, for example as cashier in a supermarket. Overtime work is usually paid (unless otherwise agreed in contract).\n\nIf you want to check the average salaries by industry or make sure you get the right amount paid,  Swiss employees are heavy organized in trade unions SGB ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.sgb.ch"]}," and always keen to help you.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay safe"]},"\n\nSwitzerland is not surprisingly one of the safest countries in Europe, but anywhere that attracts Rolex-wearing bankers and crowds of distracted tourists will also bring out a few pickpockets. Obviously, keep an eye on belongings, especially in the midst of summer crowds.\n\nQuite a few Swiss establishments will print your ",{"type":"''","value":["entire"]}," credit card number onto the receipt, thus raising identity theft concerns when shopping with a credit card in Switzerland. Therefore, visitors using credit cards should carefully review the information printed on all receipts before discarding them. This happens, for instance, in some book and clothing stores and even at the ubiquitous K-Kiosk. This list is obviously not exhaustive; therefore, the visitor must beware whenever using a credit card.\n\nWomen traveling alone should have no problems. The younger Swiss tend to be very open with public displays of affection - sometimes too open, and some women may find people getting too friendly especially in the wee hours of the club & bar scene. Usually the international language of brush-offs or just walking away is enough.\n\nSwiss police take on a relatively unobtrusive air; they prefer to remain behind the scenes, as they consider their presence potentially threatening to the overall environment (practice of deescalation).  Unlike some more highly policed countries, officers will rarely approach civilians to ask if they need help or merely mark their presence by patrolling.  However, police are indeed serious about traffic violations.  Jaywalking (crossing a red pedestrian light), for example, will be fined on the spot.  The upside to stringent traffic rules is that automobile drivers are generally very well-disciplined, readily stopping for pedestrians at crosswalks, for example (but note that, in Basel city at least, whilst the cross-walks give priority to pedestrians many drivers will stop on and reverse over cross-walks without much care or attention). Generally, you are safe anywhere at any time. If, for any reason, you feel threatened, seek a nearby restaurant or telephone booth.  The emergency phone number in Switzerland is 117, and operators are generally English-speaking. \n\nFootball (soccer) games are the only notable exception to the above rule. Due to the potential threat of hooligan violence, these games (especially in Basel or Zurich) are generally followed by a large contingent of police officers with riot gear, rubber bullets, and tear gas, in case of any major unrest.\n\nSwitzerland has very strong Good Samaritan laws, making it a civic duty to help a fellow in need (without unduly endangering oneself).  People are therefore very willing and ready to help you if you appear to be in an emergency situation.  Be aware, though, that the same applies to you if you witness anyone in danger.  The refusal to help to a person in need can be punishable by law as \"Verweigerung der Hilfeleistung\", i.e. refusal of aid.  The general reservation of Americans to avoid entanglement with strangers due to possible future civil liability does not apply in Switzerland, for it would be practically impossible to wage a civil suit against anyone providing aid.\n\nThe drinking age for beer, wine and alcoholic cider is 16 (but not in all cantons, so make sure to ask before buying) while the age for any other alcohol (e.g. spirits, \"alcopops\", etc.) is 18. The public consumption of alcohol in Switzerland is legal, so do not be alarmed if you see a group of teenagers drinking a six-pack on public property; this is by no means out of the ordinary and should not be interpreted as threatening.\n\nSwitzerland is not a country of insane civil lawsuits and damage claims; consequently, if you see a sign or disclaimer telling you not to do something, obey it!  An example: in many alpine areas, charming little mountain streams may be flanked by signs with the message \"No Swimming\". To the uninitiated, this may seem a bit over the top, but these signs are in fact a consequence of the presence of hydroelectric power plants further upstream that may discharge large amounts of water without warning.\n\nIn mountain areas, be sure to inquire about weather conditions at the tourist information office or local train station as you head out in the morning.  They should be well informed about severe weather conditions and will advise you about possible avalanche areas.\n\nThere have been problems with police assuming that any Black, East European, or Arab person without an ID card or passport is an illegal immigrant, and treating them accordingly. That could be a considerable problem if you are travelling alone.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Stay healthy"]},"\n\nGenerally there is no problem with food and water in Switzerland.  Restaurants are controlled by strict rules.  Water is drinkable everywhere, even out of public fountains unless specially marked (Kein Trinkwasser - Non potable - Non potabile).  There are many organic food stores and restaurants available and it's currently illegal to sell any genetically modified food.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Respect"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Please mind the sleepers.JPG"],["thumbnail"],["Street sign in Geneva asking partygoers to keep their voices down at night"]]},"\nLearning the mother tongue of the area you will be staying in is a great sign of respect. English is widely spoken in Switzerland, but any attempt to speak the local language is always appreciated (especially in the French-speaking part of the country), even if you're replied to in English.  It’s always polite to ask if they speak English before starting a conversation.\n\nMake an effort to at least learn Hello, Goodbye, Please, and Thank You in the language of the region you will be traveling in.  \"I would like...\" is also a phrase that will help you. If you are in the German speaking region of Switzerland, it is generally wise to try to communicate in German rather than attempting to speak Alemannic. The German Swiss almost instinctively switch to German once they notice that they are speaking to a foreigner. \n\nGerman, French, and Italian all have formal and informal forms of the word ",{"type":"''","value":["you"]},", which changes the conjugation of the verb you use, and sometimes phrases. For example, the informal phrase ",{"type":"''","value":["don't worry about it"]}," in French is ",{"type":"''","value":["ne t'en fais pas"]}," and the formal is ",{"type":"''","value":["ne vous en faites pas."]}," The formal is used to show respect to someone who is older than you, who you consider to be a superior, someone who has a greater rank than you at work, or simply a stranger in the street. The informal is used with close friends, relatives, and peers.\n\nAs a general rule, you shouldn't use the informal with someone you don't know well, someone who is your superior in rank, or an elder. \n\nUse the informal with your close friends and younger people. Peers can be a gray area, and it is advisable to use the formal at first until they ask you to use the informal.\n\nFriends kiss each other on the cheek three times (left - right - left). \nThis is the usual thing to do when being introduced to someone in the French and German speaking part. If it is a business related meeting you just shake hands. Don't be shy, if you reject the advance it appears awkward and rude on your part. You don't have to actually touch your lips to the skin after-all, as a fake kiss will do.\n\nDo not litter. While Switzerland will not fine you (as in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Singapore"]]},"), littering is definitely seen as bad behaviour in this country and in general in German speaking Europe or Central Europe for that matter.  Also make sure that you put your litter in the correctly labeled bin (e.g. recyclable). Some bins actually have times when this should be done to avoid excess noise!\n\nBe punctual. That means no more than one minute late, if that! Not surprisingly for a country that is known for making clocks, the Swiss have a near-obsession with being on time.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Connect"]},"\nMany of the internet cafes that have emerged in the 1990s have closed since, probably because Switzerland has one of the highest rate of high-speed internet connections in homes in the world, but almost any video rental shop and most train stations will have a few internet terminals. The tourist office should be able to direct you to the nearest one. The going rate is 5 CHF for 20 minutes.\nAlso, you can send email, SMS (text messages to cell phones) or short text faxes from just about every public phone booth for less than 1 CHF. Some public phone booths allow you to browse the internet. There are many shopping centers and cities (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Lausanne"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Vevey"]]}," for example) that offer free wireless internet access: ask the young locals; maybe they know where to go.\n\nThe public phones are surprisingly cheap, and have no surcharge for credit cards.\n\nIf you stay for some time, it may be advisable to buy a pre-paid cell phone card that you can use in any phone that supports the GSM standard on the 900\/1800 MHz bands - they usually cost around 10-40 CHF and are obtainable in the shops of the mobile service providers Swisscom, Orange or Sunrise in most cities. Mobile network coverage is close to 100% by area, even in the mountainous, non-populated areas.\n\nThere are also a lot of cheap prepaid cards for local calls from other providers. The prepaid cards of the big supermarket chains Migros (M-Budget-Mobile ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.m-budget-mobile.ch\/"]},") and Coop ( Coop Mobile ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.coop.ch\/coopmobile\/"]},") for example cost around 20 CHF and include already 15 CHF airtime. The cheapest prepaid card for calls within Switzerland is Aldi Mobile ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.aldi-mobile.ch\/"]},": 0,14 CHF\/min Switzerland fixed and Aldi mobile, 0,34 CHF\/min other mobiles. The cheapest prepaid card for international communication is yallo ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.yallo.ch\/"]},": 0,39 CHF\/min within Switzerland as well as to all European and many more countries (to the mobile and fixed networks). This includes the UK, USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. SMS cost 0,10 CHF. The prepaid cards can be bought online (30 CHF with 30 CHF airtime inclusive), in most post offices (29 CHF with 20 CHF airtime inclusive) or Sunrise shops (20 CHF with 20 CHF airtime inclusive). An other prepaid card with cheap rates offers Lebara Mobile (Sister company of Sunrise). The prepaid card is available for 5 CHF with an equivalent talk time and recharge vouchers offer the talktime equivalent to the price of the voucher.\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecountry"]]},"\n\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Switzerland"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Europe\/Switzerland\/"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["isPartOf"],["Central_Europe"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["46.833333333333"],["8.3333333333333"]]}]
