European settlement rapidly displaced the Aboriginal people of the Sydney area with colonists largely coming from England, Ireland and Scotland. The Australian goldrush attracted more immigrants, including a significant number of Chinese, with about one in six Australians with convict descent also having some Chinese ancestry. In the early 20th century, Sydney continued to attract immigrants - mostly from the U.K. and Ireland, with the White Australia Policy preventing non-European peoples (and even Southern Europeans) from settling.  Australia's immigration patterns, and consequently, that of Sydney, changed significantly after WWII, when migrants began to arrive from countries as diverse as Italy, Greece, Germany, Holland, China, New Zealand, India, the Philippines, Poland, Lebanon, Iraq, Vietnam, Thailand, South Africa and the Pacific Islands. Sydney's culture, food and general outlook well reflect these contributions to the majority Anglo-Celtic institutions and social establishment.\n\nSydney is recognised worldwide for its vibrant gay community. Every year, the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras is celebrated on the first weekend in March, drawing people from all over Australia and the world for the celebrations.\n\nSydney was the centre of the world's attention in September 2000 when the city hosted the Summer Olympics - officially announced by the IOC Chairman at the closing Ceremony to be the \"the best games ever\"! The Olympics saw a major building and renovation program take hold of Sydney, positioning it as one of the great world cities of the 21st century.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\n\nSydney is comfortable for travellers to visit any time of year.

Summer days can be humid, and sometimes have searing dry winds, but hot days frequently end with a \"southerly buster\", a cold front sweeping up from the south, bringing a clearly noticeable drop in temperature, as wells as rain and thunder. Within hours, the storm can pass and the evening continues cooler.  Hot, windy days can create a risk of bushfire, and on days of severe risk national parks and walking trails may be closed.

The train network will take passengers to most of the metropolitan area, with the exception of the north-west and northern beaches. Trains service every station in the metropolitan area at least every 30 minutes (except for the Carlingford line)  Frequency is higher in the city, and major centres (Chatswood, Parramatta, Bondi Junction, the Airport, etc) usually see a train every 10 minutes or so.  Peak times (7AM-9:30AM and 4:30PM-7PM) have more frequent and also crowded trains, as well as some express services that skip more stations.  Expect congestion around Central and Town Hall.\n\nThere are different styles and ages of trains running on the network.  You may get a clean modern train, comfortable seating and clear station announcements.  Alternatively, you could get a train like a sauna packed in like sardines in  the summer afternoon peak, with station announcements that are barely audible, if at all.  Prepare yourself with a network map and a bottle of cold water, just in case.  All Sydney trains are now air-conditioned.\n\nMost train services ",{"type":"'''","value":["do not stop"]}," at every station and do not travel to the furthest extent of the line.   Look at the departure screens at the station concourse which indicate when the next train will arrive, its destination, the platform it will depart from, and the stations it will stop at. Alternatively, you can also listen to announcements that will regularly play before and when a train arrives at the platform.  Or if you have mobile Internet services use the Transport Info trip planner.\n\nOutside of operating hours, between midnight (1AM on Fridays and Saturdays) and 5AM, ",{"type":"'''","value":["NightRide buses"]}," run at least every hour. Any train ticket is valid for the equivalent NightRide bus except a single. If you have no ticket, you must buy a NightRide single from the driver, which is more expensive than a single for the train. NightRide buses stop at most stations and a few additional stops, but they do not travel on the same routes. If you intend catching a NightRide bus home, check the NightRide route map on the back cover of each timetable, or with the Transport Infoline.  Buses can be crowded on Friday and Saturday nights. \n\nExercise caution whilst travelling on trains after 8pm, particularly if the carriage is mostly deserted and if travelling to greater western Sydney, as it is not uncommon for undesirables to be found on trains during these times. 99% of the time they will not cause you any more trouble other than being loud, vulgar and obnoxious, but it is best to avoid them as unwanted altercations may follow. Moving to other carriages would be a good idea. Otherwise, travel in the middle carriage with the train guard (marked with a blue light). The guard has contact with police and the driver if there is any trouble on the train.\n\nOn weekends, check for trackwork before leaving for the station; Sydney Trains will transfer passengers to buses if lines are closed for trackwork, and the process will add at least half an hour to a typical journey. Trackwork is common on weekends and will be advertised at the station and the Sydney Trains website for about a week before it begins.  You need the same Sydney Trains ticket for the trackwork buses as you would for the train.\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Mytrain ticket.jpg"],["thumb"],["An example of one of Sydney's train tickets"]]},"\nIf you don't have a Multi ticket, you will need to purchase a ticket for the entire journey at your origin ",{"type":"''","value":["before"]}," boarding a train.

Fares are distance based, between $3.20 and $6.00 for a single within Sydney. Short train rides using single tickets (for example one or two stations in the City) can get quite expensive. Return tickets are 30% cheaper after 9am in the morning and on weekends. \n\nTicket offices have limited opening hours at suburban stations and outside of these hours you will need to use a ticket machine.  The ticket machines accept up to $50 notes but will give only $19.90 in change (in coins) and accept only 10 coins and 6 notes. Some ticket machines also accept Visa or Mastercard at most stations, but only if you have a PIN.  Ticket offices also accept Visa or Mastercard, and allow you to have a PIN or sign.  Ticket inspectors fine you $200 if you are caught on a train or platform without a ticket.

Some buses run from distant suburbs such as those on the Northern Beaches and North West all the way to the city, but there are also shorter feeders to suburban rail stations from surrounding suburbs.\n\nIt is a good idea to plan your bus trips in advance where possible. The Sydney Buses website has a helpful trip planner feature to assist you, as well as route maps and schedules to print. Most bus stops have timetables posted, as well as a route map for the routes servicing that bus stop.\n\nYou must flag down buses with an outstretched hand if you want them to stop for you and you must press the STOP button on board to disembark.  They will not automatically stop unless they are signalled to do so.\n\nOn most buses there is nothing on the bus to tell you which stop you are approaching or which stop you are at.  There are no poster maps on the bus either.  If you are not sure where you are getting off, pick up or print out the timetable (found on the Sydney Buses website), which has a route map on it and watch for landmarks as you pass.  Also, if you take a bus marked \"Limited Stops\" or \"Express\" (the route number will start with an L or an X), make sure that the bus stops where you want it to. Limited stops services stop only at major stops so they may make you walk around 750 metres or so if they skip your stop. However, express services can run very far from the city without stopping at all, before resuming a normal stopping pattern (express buses only operate during peak hours). All normally numbered buses stop at all stops, so missing your stop or getting off one stop early is a less serious mistake.  Red Metrobuses (routes numbers starting with M) are longer route, cross city buses, running at 10-20 minute frequencies during their operational hours. These buses sometimes have a screen displaying the next stop and onboard announcements as well. Metrobus stops usually have a name on top of the stand which easily indicates a Metrobus services the particular stop.\n\nThere are two main bus termination points in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sydney\/City"],["CBD"]]},", at Wynyard and Circular Quay. These two points are separated by a one-stop commuter train trip. You will need to make this trip if connecting from buses arriving from north of the harbour bridge to buses heading east or west, or vice versa. Bus information centres are located at both Wynyard and Circular Quay.\n\nIf you don't have a Multi ticket, you can buy a single tickets or a ten trip ticket (commonly known as a \"Travel Ten\").\n\nYou must buy your ticket before boarding the bus if you are in the City area, Bondi Junction, Parramatta Rd, Norton Street, Anzac Parade, Military Road or on most of the limited stop services or M10, M20, M30, M40, and M50 Metrobus routes that run through the city to help buses run on time.  Otherwise, you have the option to buy your ticket in advance or you can pay cash to the driver.  Single and ten-trip tickets can only be bought in advance, and can't be bought on buses.  You can buy as many tickets in advance as you like, and validate them as you board the bus (either dip them in the green machine on entry, or if there is no machine the driver will mark them on the front).  Ten trip tickets can be used for multiple passengers in a group, simply dip the ticket once for each person in the group.  Tickets can be bought in advance from 7-Eleven, some newsagents\/convenience stores, train stations (ten-trip tickets only) and transit shops.  Look for the yellow or purple flags outside the shop.\n\nThere are three distance based fare bands, MyBus1, MyBus2 and MyBus3, which have no relation at all to the three MyMulti zones with the same numbers.  If buying a ticket for cash from the driver just state your destination.  If you are buying a ticket in advance, you need to know which fare band you need.

Trips under 3km are usually MyBus1, 3-6km MyBus2, and any further is a MyBus3.

Similarly, you can use an app like TripView to track arrival times in real time.  \n\nA few trunk routes run to the Eastern Suburbs and to Newtown 24 hours a day.

Allow double the normal travel time during these periods - longer if you are using motorways. Congestion is considerably worse and longer in both directions during the Friday afternoon peak.  Some roads experience congestion at other times and roads heading to shopping, sports, parks and beaches can be heavily congested on weekends also - particularly on Saturday mornings and Saturday evenings.

If you park illegally in a disabled spot, the fine is $441.  If you do get fined for exceeding time, you will not be fined again the same day so you might as well enjoy your parking spot.\n\nClearways are no-stopping zones on main roads during peak periods, marked with clearway signs and a broken yellow line on the kerb.

Some roads have variable speed limits that change during busy traffic times.  Every road in Sydney has a signposted speed limit and the only way to be sure of the limit is to pay attention to the signs.  You cannot tell the speed limit just by looking at the road.

The availability of a taxi is indicated by an illuminated \"taxi\" sign positioned on top of the vehicle.  If the light is on, it is available for hire; if the light is off, the cab is occupied.

It is just as difficult 2:30AM-3:30AM, as almost all of the drivers change over their shifts at the same time. They are similarly scarce on a Friday and Saturday evenings.  Booking in advance is no guarantee, as these jobs are simply offered electronically to drivers, who may or may not accept the job.  It is easily possible to wait an hour or more for a taxi booked 24 hours in advance on a Friday and Saturday evening.  Ringing the taxi company back and complaining will often help (if the operators can relate to your problem, they have the ability to offer a taxi driver an incentive to take your fare). Cancelling your job and ringing another taxi company in frustration never helps as the taxi companies have handover systems that have seen your job handed over if another company had more capacity. You will just end up at the back of the queue again. Evenings other than Friday and Saturday are usually fine.\n\nDuring busy times, some unscrupulous drivers may try to leave the door locked and ask where you are going through the window and drive off if the destination is too close or not on their way home, even though this is illegal.

You can check the rate your taxi is using by looking for a 1 or a 2 next to the current charge: if it is set to 2, it is using the night rate.  The so called \"waiting\" rate is charged whenever the speed drops below 25km\/h.  For trips in congested traffic, it is possible for large amounts of the trip to be charged at the \"waiting\" rate.  All Sydney taxis are metered and taxi drivers will charge the metered rate, adding the charges for tolls manually. Silver Service taxis are more luxurious vehicles, but they are charged at the same rate as standard taxis.\n\nTaxis accept all major credit cards.  They charge an extra 10% on top of the fare for this. \n\nPassengers are required to pay all tolls for their trip. In addition, passengers who are taken north over the Harbour Bridge, for which there is no toll, are required to pay the driver's southbound toll for the return into the city (Time of day tolling applies, and the toll varies between $2.50 and $4). Drivers will usually take the toll roads unless you ask them not to.  If you are unsure why they are asking for an amount above that shown on the meter, just ask.\n\nPassengers have the right to control the air conditioning and the radio so ask the driver.  Whilst most taxi drivers behave acceptably, there have been reported incidences of taxi drivers behaving inappropriately towards women: it is always safer to sit in the back of the car.\n\nTipping is not required or generally expected. However, rounding up a taxi fare to the next dollar (or five or ten dollars, depending on the base fare) is fairly common.

Cyclists are permitted just about everywhere on Sydney's roads, except for of some freeway tunnels where bicycle signs will usually direct you to the alternative route.  Kerbside lanes are often narrow, so ride assertively, be seen, and take the full lane when you know there is insufficient room to be passed.

Lots of shade and cafes to break the trip. Some other separated cycleways have opened in the City centre, but they are yet to form a cohesive network, and your trip may easily end up on a busy and unforgiving city road if you haven't planned well in advance.\n\nOther cycleways are often just converted footpaths, so be on the lookout for bollards, street signs, roots and branches strategically placed across cycle paths - as well as pedestrians. If cycling at night ensure you have lights bright enough to light your path.\n\nIt is illegal to ride bicycles on footpaths unless cycling with children under 12. In reality this is fairly weakly enforced out in the suburbs, but it is common for people to be fined for cycling through pedestrian malls in the city like Pitt St Mall or Martin Place.  Out in the suburbs you can often follow quiet streets, and hop onto the footpath for a short stretch if things get too hairy.

At the real top-end places a dinner for two with wine can run up to $400-500 and beyond.\n\nFor the more budget-conscious, Sydney's multicultural demography means plenty of quality ethnic cuisine for cheap eats, particularly Asian restaurants in Chinatown where rock bottom priced food (but no less tasty) can be found. Plonk down at a laminate table shoulder to shoulder with hungry locals for some bubble tea and a sizzling plate of delicious Asian food.

Most Australians will still not tip, and you should feel free to follow their lead should you wish to.  Some snootier waiters may raise an eyebrow, but nobody will follow you or give you a hard time.  Otherwise a 10% tip added to the bill or rounding the bill up to the nearest $10, $20 or $50 to a maximum of 10% (depending on the size of the bill!) will usually meet their expectations.

Thanks to recent changes in legislation, there is now a burgeoning scene for quirky and unique small bars, and the city's cultural life has enjoyed a refreshing growth in night-time choices. There's a litany of clubs and venues for entertainment, and as with most Australian cities, Sydney has a strong live music scene. The majority of pubs and smaller clubs close before 3AM and some as early as 12PM, particularly if there are nearby residents. A limited number of venues have 24-hour licenses.\n\nYou cannot enter any venue in the Sydney CBD (that is, East to Woolloomooloo and Kings' Cross, West to Darling Harbour, North to the bridge or South to Central Station) after 1:30am, and last drinks will be called at 3:00am. However, there are lots of bars outside the lockout zone.\n\nBusy venues will have door staff checking photo identification to determine that you are over 18. Admission is also commonly refused to those who seem visibly drunk. More popular venues have discriminatory door practices, the most common of which is refusing entry to groups of men who are not accompanied by women.  Some pubs and most clubs will admit children accompanied by adults as long as they don't approach the bar or enter an area where there is gambling, particularly earlier in the evening.  Check with staff at the venue.  Some pubs don't provide a nice environment for children some nights.\n\nMany places have at least a basic dress code, enforced all hours in the city, and usually after 7pm in the suburbs. For most generic pubs, men should wear closed toe shoes (not running sneakers), full-length pants, and a shirt with sleeves (not a singlet). For clubs, men should don neat business-style shoes.  In almost all cases, women can dress more freely, but a small number of places require closed shoes or dressy sandals or high heels.\n\nMany pubs are called hotels, but only very few can ever offer you a place to sleep. Hotel pubs are usually found on a street corner with at least one ground-floor bar, and are usually a few floors high (though not all floors may be open to the public).\n\nEntry charges for live music or DJs are usual and range from $5 to $30 depending on clientèle. Entry charges are rare if you're going into a pub for a drink.\n\nThere is a taxi shift change at 3AM, and it is notoriously difficult to catch a taxi anywhere between 2:30AM and 3:30AM. Also beware that there is currently a government enforced lockout at many establishments between 2 and 5AM - which means that you need to stay inside or you won't be able to get back in - even if you go out for a cigarette (smoking is illegal inside). Ask the bouncers or some locals if you're unsure and they will tell you which places are affected by the lockout and which aren't.\n\nSome types of nightlife are concentrated in particular areas:\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"'''","value":["Backpackers"]}," drink near the hostels, and will find a lot of fellow budget travellers in pubs in the Eastern Suburbs Beaches like ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Bondi Beach#Drink"],["Bondi Beach"]]}," and Kings Cross in the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sydney\/City East#Drink"],["City East"]]}]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" In some ways ",{"type":"'''","value":["Irish pubs"]}," are a global phenomenon, but they've certainly taken Sydney by storm.

They will often make up the usual stories about needing a train fare etc. Simply say \"Sorry, no\" and they will usually leave you alone. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Violent crime "]},"\n\nSydney has some of the violent crime issues that plague major cities, however, in general, no special precautions are required visiting the typical tourist areas during the day.\n\nMost assaults in Sydney take place in or near pubs and nightclubs at night, and involve alcohol. Most involve young males as perpetrators and victims. Most robberies occur in nearby quiet laneways, or parks close to pubs and nightclubs at night. The most common perpetrators or robberies are drug addicts. For this reason, take care around King Cross, The Rocks, Oxford St, and the George St Cinema District, especially late at night on Fridays and Saturday nights.  Avoid Redfern station late at night.  Even changing trains at night is best done at Central rather than Redfern.  Women should take extra care at bars and keep an alert companion at hand, especially in the central hostel area, and take precautions against ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Stay safe"],["spiked drinks"]]},".\n\nSome areas of south-western and western Sydney have a reputation, generally gained by news reports of motorcycle and other gang related violence.  However, if you want to venture out into these areas during the day, there is no exceptional risk. If you're planning to head way off the tourist trail to some suburban pub or nightclub for a night out, seek some local advice.  It may be a nice pub, but it pays to be informed. Areas around railway stations tend to be hang-outs for youth gangs in Western Sydney, particularly on Friday and Saturday night.  Stay in company, and don't engage.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Public transport after dark "]},"\n\nAfter 9PM, smaller outer suburban stations can be very quiet, and many are totally unstaffed after this time.  The trains can also be empty when they get towards the end of the line at this time.  Don't expect a taxi to be waiting at every station - only the major ones will have a well patronised taxi rank.   Drunk people are common on trains late at night, particularly on Friday and Saturday nights.   In the city centre, trains tend to be busy into the evening, and obnoxious behaviour is more common than any actual danger.\n\nFor your safety, travel in the carriage closest to the guard's compartment, which is marked with a blue light on the outside of the train. If you ever feel concerned for your safety on any train, or even if you encounter anti-social activity, you can call 1800 657 926 to speak with security, then can sometimes arrange for a transit patrol to board the train and provide assistance. You can also seek assistance from the guard.  In more modern trains, you can press the button in the entry area to contact the guard.  Every train station has an orange emergency help point monitored by CCTV that connects to security, usually towards the centre of the platform.\n\nNightride buses, which replace trains after midnight, can arrange for a taxi to meet you when you get off.  Ask the driver.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Beachgoing "]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Image:Sydney Bondi Beach.jpg"],["thumb"],["Bondi Beach - Australia's most iconic beach"]]}," \nIf you are going to the beach, take the same precautions as you do anywhere in Australia.  See ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Australia#Beaches"],["Australia beach safety"]]},".\n\nThe biggest thing to remember when swimming at any Sydney beach is swim between the yellow and red flags. These flags are places by the lifeguards and indicate the safest place to swim at the beach away from dangerous currents. \n\nSydney has no really dangerous jellyfish. Bluebottles (Portuguese Man-Of-War) are blueish-purple stingers that hit the Sydney beaches a couple of days every summer, when the wind direction is right. They have an air-bladder that floats on the water, and stinging tenticles.  Often the air-bladder can be no bigger than a coin. You will see the evidence of them with their air-bags washed up on the beach if they are present.  They can give a painful sting - even when on the beach - but it won't keep everyone out of the water.  Apply a heat pack if you can, or ice, or salt water. The best way to remove the pain is to run the affected area under the hottest water you can stand.  Vinegar is useless.  Sometimes small transparent jellyfish appear in the harbour and estuaries.  You can usually avoid any groups of them, but they are mostly harmless.  More rarely larger purple jellyfish are in the harbour and other estuaries.  If you see these in the estuaries, best to stay out of their way.  Probably more of an issue to water skiers than to swimmers.\n\nSydney ocean beaches all have shark mesh nets around 100 metres out to sea, and are regularly patrolled by air for sharks.  A shark alarm will sound if any are sighted, and you should get out of the water.  The risk of shark attack swimming on a patrolled beach between the flags is virtually nil.  Shark attacks are rare on Sydney beaches, but they have occurred, although there have been no fatal attacks for 45 years.  Advice is to avoid swimming in murky water after storms, or at dusk or at dawn, and to swim in the netted enclosures within the harbour and other estuaries.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":[" Other risks "]},"\n\nTake note of the general issues regarding ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Australia#Stay safe"],["staying safe in Australia"]]},".\n\n",{"type":"==","value":[" Stay healthy "]},"\n\nIf you need an ambulance, call ",{"type":"'''","value":["000"]},". \n\nMedical centres with general practicioners are available for minor ailments without an appointment around the city and suburbs. Expect to wait around an hour or so to see a doctor. Upfront charges are usually around $50 for a standard consultation, and most centres accept credit cards.  Many medical centres remain open until 10PM or so, and a few remain open 24-hours.  Those with an Australian Medicare card will find many medical centres in Sydney that \"bulk-bill\".  \n\nMost hospitals in Sydney have emergency departments, but check before attending as some do not. Those emergency departments are open 24-hours.  See the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Australia#Stay healthy"],["Australia"]]}," article for more details on health charges.  \n\nMany pharmacies stay open after normal business hours, often in proximity to medical centres, and there are a few that stay open 24-hours.
