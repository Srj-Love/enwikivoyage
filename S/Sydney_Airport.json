Check your itinerary and flight number because check-in, connections and customs will take longer when arriving or departing from the International Terminal, even on a domestic flight.

Domestic station services T2 and T3, and International station serves T1.  The stations are connected to the airline terminals via lifts and pedestrian subways.  A single ticket to the city is $16.40 from Domestic or $17.20 from International, which includes an airport station surcharge (",{"type":"''","value":["GatePass"]},") of $12.60.  If you have or buy a ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sydney#Multi Tickets"],["MyMulti ticket"]]},", you just need to pay the gatepass fee. If you have an Opal Card, the entire fare will be deducted from your card balance.  The airport is located on the Airport & East Hills line and trains run at least every 10 minutes between 6am and 10pm.  Passengers for the city centre should take a train from Platform 1. The trains form part of the commuter train network, and during peak hours you may not get a seat.  A weekly gatepass is $20.00, and can only be bought in conjunction with a weekly ticket.  So if you are staying for a week or less, and you are buying a MyMulti-1 (or similar weekly) ticket, then you can add a weekly gatepass for less than the cost of two single gatepass fees.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus"]},"\nTo skip the GatePass fee, taking the ",{"type":"'''","value":["Route 400 local bus"]}," in conjunction with a train is a good option. This bus travels from Burwood to Bondi Junction. If going to the CBD, hail the bus at one of the stops located outside T1 and T3 (but not T2), heading towards ",{"type":"''","value":["Bondi Junction"]},". Get off at the next stop after the domestic terminal, then take a 300m walk straight along the road in the direction the bus went, towards Mascot station, crossing to the other side of the road. If heading to the airport, exit Mascot station, turn left (heading south), walk about 300m, crossing an intersection, and you will eventually reach a blue bus stop on the same side of the road as Mascot station. You will need the 400 bus heading towards ",{"type":"''","value":["Burwood"]},". The bus costs $3.30 and the train $3.40, both included with any MyMulti ticket. There is limited luggage space on the bus, but if you can manage backpacks or suitcases by yourself, it should not be a problem. Only consider this option if you have ",{"type":"''","value":["ample time"]}," to spare, as buses can be infrequent, late or cancelled. Buses are usually at 20 minute frequency and real-time location information is available via the Tripview, Arrivo, TransitTimes+ and TripGo smartphone apps.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Shuttle buses"]}," will drive passengers to the city and deliver them to the door of their hotel.  There is no regular scheduled service that you can depend on to leave frequently and on time. You can buy a ticket for a shuttle bus to your hotel from the information desks for around $15. It can be cheaper to book online in advance, but you're then committed to wait until that particular brand of shuttle turns up.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nThe airport is located roughly 13km (8 miles) south of the Sydney CBD via the M1 Eastern Distributor Motorway. This road is often heavily congested during peak periods. The M5 South Western Motorway links the airport to the South Western Suburbs of Sydney and onwards to Canberra and Melbourne, it is tolled west of the Kingsgrove Road exit.\n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Taxis"]}," to the city centre should cost approximately $40 (including tolls), and more to other Sydney destinations (The Rocks $40-45, North Sydney $45, Manly $50, Parramatta $80-100 etc.)  You can expect to pay a $3.80 airport taxi levy and a $5.50 Eastern Distributor toll on top of the metered fare.  If you are arriving on a Friday evening, you may face a long queue for taxis. Asking the driver to take O'Riordan Street is a little slower but shorter and cheaper than the Eastern Distributor tollway which frequently experiences traffic congestion during peak times.\n\nThere are a variety of ",{"type":"'''","value":["vehicle rental"]}," companies at all terminals (see Sydney Airport website for current list ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.sydneyairport.com.au\/SACL\/To+and+From+Airport\/Car+Rental\/default.htm"]},").

You return the vehicle to the same area.  \n\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Have someone pick you up"]},".  At T1 (International), a private car cannot stop legally at the arrivals area to pick up someone from the curb.  If you exit the car park within 15 minutes, it is free, otherwise it is $7 per half hour.  At T3 (domestic terminals), cars can stop at the pickup area only if there is someone already at the kerb. At T2, there is a pick up area inside the paid car park. Follow the yellow stenciled signs outside the terminal.  Car park charges apply if you stay longer than 10 minutes.  Fines apply for waiting at the arrivals areas or for picking up at the departures areas. Leaving your car is out of the question. The parking officers can photograph your car and licence plate and fine you without warning you to move along. If a wait of longer than 10 minutes is expected (perhaps due to a delay), a way to avoid the car park fee is to wait at the nearby McDonalds restaurant which has a free carpark. Once the passenger is waiting at the pickup area, it takes less than 2 minutes to drive from the McDonalds to the pickup.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["On foot"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Airport Drive.jpg"],["thumb"],["Airport Drive bridge accross Cooks river, Mascot NSW"],["thumb"],["250px"],["Bridge with footpath across Cooks River near T1"]]},"\n",{"type":"'''","value":["Walk and train from T1"]},".

The walk isn't signposted and may be very quiet after dark. It is all surfaced, has only one set of three steps (in the airport, near the customs building), and takes in some nice scenery by the Cooks River. Exit straight from the international terminal (T1), follow the pedestrian path under the multistory car park, and continue just to the left of the customs building to the pedestrian crossing. Go under the road, as indicated by a green ",{"type":"''","value":["Marsh Street"]}," sign until, you run into a green fence with the canal directly in front of you.  Follow the path up to your right around and back over the path you just walked on up to the Marsh Street bridge. Cross the Cooks River on the footpath on the right of Marsh St and then proceed along the cycleway next to the Cooks River (signposted to Tempe), keeping the river on your right.  When you reach the Princes Hwy (6 lane road), cross at the pedestrian crossing lights, and continue straight on, past the apartment blocks, shops, to the end of the road, then turn right up to Wolli Creek Station.  The walk will take about 20 minutes and will save you $12.30 (",{"type":"'''","value":["gatepass fee"]},") on the train fare.

Follow the road out of the domestic terminal and on to O'Riordan Street. Follow O'Riordan Street and then veer left onto Bourke Street. Cross Coward Street and then John Street, Mascot train station is on your right. An adult fare to the city (Central) from Mascot is $3.50 and a MyMulti card can be used with no surcharge.

Follow the cycleway east to Mascot and the City.   There are showers in T1 as described below.\n\nT2 and T3 are more problematic for bicycle access, because of the busy multi-lane road that loops the terminals with buses, taxis and cars dodging and vying for road space.  Bourke Road gets you within 400m of the terminals, and there is footpath from there to the bike parking to walk or ride if you are with a child under 12 years.
