It's one of the friendliest places in Greece. \n\nIn the nineteenth century Symi grew wealthy from the sponge trade: boats sailed as far afield as the coast of North Africa and the sponge fisherman were away from home for months on end.  Sponges are still sold in local shops, but are now all imported.  The harbour is a protected site, since most of the buildings are Neo-classical in design and date from the 19th C.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By boat"]},"\n\nFerries, and fast catamarans operate several services daily between Rhodes and Symi and also pass through less frequently en route to other islands in the Dodecanese chain.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\n\nThere is a busy little bus that runs from Yialos through Chorio to Pedi throughout the daytime and evening.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\nPanormitis - Monastery at the south of the island - accessed by boat or car\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]}," \nClimb the stairs in ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Yialos"]]},".

They can also handle other travel activities like cruises and boat rental. They have an office near the harbor (inquire locally for directions.)\n\nSymi is full of characterful villas and houses.  You can stay in a restored house in the old town, Chorio, but you'll need to climb the numerous steps to get back and forth to the harbor, and it will take some time to learn how to find your apartment in the maze of streets and alleyways. Or you can opt for harbour side views in Yialos. There is also accommodation in the quiet beach villages of Pedi and Nimborio.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]}," \n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["geo"],["36.6167"],["27.8333"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["East Aegean Islands"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["WikiPedia:Simi"]]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dmoz:Regional\/Europe\/Greece\/Prefectures\/Dodecanese\/Symi\/"]]}]
