Heid's is known for two things: long lines and the hot dogs that are responsible for those long lines. Ordering is simple: anything that isn't a hot dog or a coney gets ordered first after you get in the door, including their delicious grilled cheeses and super-thick milk shakes; at the end, once you get to the cash register, you simply order how many hot dogs and coneys you'd like. If the retro-style of the restaurant isn't to your liking, you can always cross the street and sit by Onondaga Lake."]]}]},"\n",{"type":"===","value":["Mid-range"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"'''","value":["Coleman's Authentic Irish Pub"]},", 100 South Lowell Ave. +1 315 476-1933, ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.colemansirishpub.com\/syracuse.htm"]},".
