The official language is Arabic, but other tongues that are occasionally understood include Kurdish, Armenian, Turkish, French and English. The Syrian Republic is officially secular. Nonetheless, it is greatly influenced by the majority religion of Islam (80% of the population, split between 64% Sunni Muslim and 16% other Muslim, Alawites and Druze). There is a large Christian minority that amounts to about 10% of the population.\n\nThe President of Syria is Bashar al-Assad, who replaced his father Hafez al-Assad soon after his death on 10 June 2000. Having studied to become an ophthalmologist (eye doctor) in Damascus and London, Bashar was groomed for the presidency after the 1994 car accident of his elder brother Basil. As a consequence, he joined the army and became colonel in 1999. Bashar's modernising credentials were somewhat boosted by his role in a domestic anti-corruption drive. More recently, however, after an initial period of increased openness. Bashar's position as head of the Syrian state rests on his presidency of the Baath Party and his command-in-chief of the army.\n\nAssad's regime and the Baath Party own or control the vast majority of Syria's media. Criticism of the president and his family is not permitted and the press (both foreign and domestic) is heavily censored for material deemed threatening or embarrassing to the government. A brief period of relative press freedom arose after Bashar became president in 2000 and saw the licensing of the first private publications in almost 40 years. A later crackdown, however, imposed a range of restrictions regarding licensing and content. In a more relaxed manner (perhaps owing more to the fact that these matters are largely beyond possible government control), many Syrians have gained access to foreign television broadcasts (usually via satellite) as well as the three state-run networks. In 2002 the government set out conditions for licensing private, commercial FM radio stations, ruling at the same time, however, that radio stations could not broadcast news or political content.\n\nTourist Information Offices; Damascus: 2323953, Damascus Int'l Airport: 2248473, Aleppo: 2121228, Daraa (Jordanian-Syrian border gate): 239023, Latakia: 216924, Palmyra (Tadmur): 910636, Deir-az-Zur: 358990\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Regions"]},"\nSyria officially has 14 governorates, but the following conceptual division used to make more sense for travellers:\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Regionlist"],["regionmap=Map of Syria.png"],["regionmaptext=Regions of Syria"],["regionmapsize=350px"],["region1name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Northwestern Syria"]]}],["region1color=#71B37B"],["region1description=Aleppo, one of the oldest cities in the world, as well as the Dead Cities, 700 abandoned settlements in the northwest of the country"],["region2name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hauran"]]}],["region2color=#D56D76"],["region2description=A volcanic plateau in the southwest of Syria, also includes the capital Damascus and its sphere of influence"],["region3name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Orontes Valley"]]}],["region3color=#B383B3"],["region3description=The Orontes Valley, home to the towns of Hama and Homs"],["region4name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Syrian Coast and Mountains"]]}],["region4color=#83A2C0"],["region4description=Green and fertile, relatively Christian, somewhat liberal, and dominated by Phoenician and Crusader history"],["region5name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Syrian Desert"]]}],["region5color=#D5DC76"],["region5description=A vast empty desert with the oasis of Palmyra, as well the basin of the Euphrates, which is historically associated with the Assyrian and Babylonian history"]]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Occupied territory"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Regionlist"],["region1name=",{"type":"[[","value":[["Golan Heights"]]}],["region1color=#505F4F"],["region1items="],["region1description=Occupied by Israel in 1967 and formally annexed in 1981, the Golan Heights is claimed by Syria.

Most nationals must apply for a Syrian visa in the country in which they are a citizen. Alternatively a foreign national may apply for a Syrian visa from a Syrian Consulate in a country other than their own if they hold a residency visa valid for at least 6 months for the country in which they are applying. There are very few exceptions to this rule.

US citizens cost US$16 or €12, while others are more costly, Japanese are USD12-14 or €9-11, Singaporeans are USD33 or €25, Australians\/New Zealanders are about USD100 or €75.99, Swiss are USD63 or €47.88.  They only take US dollars or Euros. You may only receive a 15-day single-entry tourist visa and will have to go through this process if you ever re-enter Syria. When you exit Syria, you will have to buy\/pay an exit card for about USD12 or €9.15.\n\nIf going by land, and you are planning to get a visa on the border, bring US dollars, euros or Syrian pounds. Other foreign currency will not get a good exchange rate and at most crossing there are no facilities for credit\/debit cards. Travellers cheques are also not accepted. \n\nAmerican citizens need to beware of sanctions on Syria.  While travelling and spending money in Syria is permitted, you may not fly with Syrian Arab Airlines, and more importantly, many US banks err on the safe side and ban all business with Syria.  Some credit or ATM cards may not work, although many Americans today experience little problems in this regard.

Due to the current civil war, most airlines have suspended service to these airports.\n\nUpon arrival, a free entry visa can be delivered to almost all travellers if they are being received by a local travel agency. Call the Syrian Embassy in your home country for more information.\n\nSyria levies a departure tax of SYP550 (~US$13) at land and sea borders. Since Summer 2009 airport departure tax is included in the ticket price, and airlines will put a manual stamp on your boarding pass.\n\nOne of the practical and reasonable ways to enter Syria from Turkey is to take a domestic flight to Gaziantep and then taxi to Aleppo through Oncupinar border-gate in Kilis. The journey takes around 2 hours including custom formalities. The fare is USD60, per car with max 4 and one way. Taxis holding licence can be arranged in Kilis or Gaziantep.

If you want a private taxi then you will have to pay for every seat. From Latakia to Beirut a seat in a service will cost SYP800 with around SYP500 being charged from Tartous to Tripoli.

Taxis from the airport to the downtown Damascus cost about SYP600-800, slightly more at night.

Especially in Damascus and Aleppo, near-constant congestion, a very aggressive driving style, bad roads and highly dubious quality of road signs make driving there an interesting experience. so do be careful.\n\nThe only road rule that might come in handy is that, as opposed to most of the rest of the world, in roundabouts, the entering cars have the right of way, and the cars that are already in the roundabout have to wait. Aside from that, it seems that motorists are fairly free to do as they please.\n\nIf you have an accident in a rental car, you must obtain a police report, no matter how small the damage or how clear it is who is at fault – otherwise, you will be liable for the damage. Police (road police No:115) probably will only be albe to speak Arabic, so try to make other drivers help you and\/or call your rental agency.\n\nGas (marked as \"Super\", red stands) comes at SYP40 per litre (+10%tax) so it is SYP44, diesel (green stand) at approx. half the price.

The destinations are written on the front of microbus in Arabic. Usually, the passenger sitting behind the driver deals with the money. You can ask the driver to stop anywhere along his route.\n\nOften, microbuses will do longer routes, for example, to surrounding villages around Damascus and Aleppo, or from Homs to Tadmor or Krak des Chevaliers. They are often more uncomfortable and crowded than the larger buses, but cheaper. Especially for shorter distances they have usually more frequent departures than buses.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bus or coach"]},"\nAir-conditioned coaches are one of the easy ways to make longer hauls around Syria, for example, the trip from Damascus to Palmyra. Coaches are cheap, fast and reliable way to get around the country, however the schedules, when they exist, are not to be trusted.  For the busy routes it's best to simply go to the coach station when you want to leave and catch the next coach, you'll have to wait a bit, but most of the time it's  less of a chore than finding out when the best coach will be leaving, and then often finding it's late.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By train"]},"\nThe Syrian railways were reasonably modern. Rail travel is inexpensive and generally punctual, although railway stations are often a reasonable distance out of town centres. The main line connects Damascus, Aleppo, Deir ez-Zur, Hassake and Qamishle. A secondary line serves stations along the Mediterranean coast.\n\nIn the summer, on Fridays, a little steam train leaves from the Hejaz Railway Station in Damascus (which has a good restaurant) and climbs into the Anti-Lebanon Mountains. Many locals enjoy the ride to picnic in the cooler mountains.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By bicycle"]},"\nWhile travelling by bicycle may not be for everyone, and Syria is by no means a cycle tourist's paradise, there are definite advantages. Syria is a good size for cycling, accommodation is frequent enough that even a budget traveller can get away with \"credit card\" touring (though in the case of Syria, it might be better to refer to it as fat-wad-of-cash touring). There are sites that one can not get to with public transportation like the Dead Cities and the people are incredibly friendly often inviting a tired cyclist for a break, cup of tea, meal or night's accommodation. The problem of children throwing stones at cyclists or running behind the bicycle begging for candy and pens (such as in parts of Morocco) does not seem to have appeared in Syria. Locals young and old alike will, however, be very curious about your travels and your bicycle and if you stop in a town you can expect a large crowd to gather for friendly banter about where you are from and your trip.\n\nWild camping is quite easy in Syria. Perhaps the biggest challenge is not so much finding a place for your tent but picking a spot where locals will not wander by and try to convince you to come back to their home. Olive groves and other orchards can make a good spot for your tent, except on a rainy day when the mud will make life difficult. Another option is to ask to pitch your tent in a private garden or beside an official post like a police station. It is unlikely you will be refused as long as you can get your message across. A letter in Arabic explaining your trip will help with communication.\n\nUnfortunately, the standard of driving skills in Syria is extremely low and other road users tend to drive very aggressively. They do seem used to seeing slow moving traffic and normally give plenty of room as they pass. Motorcycles are perhaps the biggest danger as their drivers like to pull up alongside cyclists to chat or fly by your bike for a look at the strange traveller and then perform a U-turn in the middle of the road to go back home. Perhaps the safest option in this case is to stop, talk for a few minutes and then carry on. \n\nFinding good maps tends to be another problem. You should bring a map with you as good maps are hard to find in Syria. Free ones are available from the tourist bureaus but they are not very good for cycle touring. Even foreign-produced maps can contain errors or roads that don't exist, making excursions away from the main route a challenge. Asking several locals for the right road is a good idea when you come to a crossroads. Without good maps it can be hard to avoid riding on the main highway, which while safe enough (a good wide shoulder exists on almost all the highways) is not very pleasant due to the smokey trucks and uninteresting scenery.\n\nYou should think about bringing a water filter or water treatment tablets with you. Bottled water is not always available in the smaller towns. Finding local water is easy. Tall metal water coolers in many town centres dispense free local water and water is always available near mosques. The Syrian word for water is pronounced like the English word “my” (as in “that is my pen”) with a slight ",{"type":"''","value":["A"]}," afterwards and if you ask at any shop or home for water they will happily refill your bottles.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["Arabic"]]}," is the official language.

The child beggars are more embarrassing than intimidating, but if you are being hassled consistently, say \"lah\" (\"no\" in Arabic) forcefully and the children will scamper.  \n\nSince begging is common in some parts of Syria, particularly outside of tourist attractions, mosques, and churches, it has been known that beggars occasionally demand money and may follow you around until you give. Some have even been known to \"attack\" some tourists just for money and food. It is advised to wear appropriate Arab clothing and try to blend yourself in.

Many local women dress in Western attire, especially in Christian neighbourhoods. Shorts are common for both men and women.

The coastal areas are much more progressive when dealing with religion and the same applies to areas of Damascus most frequented by Western tourists such as Bab Touma, the Christian Quarter.

It is usually SYP50 per hour (USD1), but can be anywhere up to SYP100 per hour (USD2). It is best to avoid political debates regarding the Syrian government, or reading Israeli newspapers or websites on-line. \n\nPrices for high-speed access are quite varied. As of November 2007, Aleppo's Concord internet café was charging a hefty SYP100 an hour, while in Hama the going rate seemed to be SYP75for an hour and in Damascus the price dropped to around 50 S.P an hour (less if you pay for several hours in advance).
