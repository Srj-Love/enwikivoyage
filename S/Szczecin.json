The city has a population of over 400 000 thousand, with almost 800 000 living its metro area, and is one of the seven largest metropoles in the country. It lies in the northwestern corner of Poland, very close to the German border, and it is in fact easier to get to Szczecin from some parts of Germany, notable from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Berlin"]]},", than it is from much of the Polish territory. For a significant part of its history, actually, Szczecin was a part of Germany, as well as, in other periods, of Denmark and Sweden.\n\nSzczecin is Poland third-largest port and much of its industrial base used to be a part of an important shipyard, so it may come as a surprise to the casual tourist that the city does not lay on a seaside, but rather over the river Odra (German: ",{"type":"''","value":["Oder"]},"), some 20 kilometres south of the Baltic Sea as the crow flies, and many more by road. Many visitors to Poland are also unaware of Szczecin's architectural attractiveness, as the large parts of the city were designed by Baron Haussmann, the same gentleman who designed the boulevards of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Paris"]]},". \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Understand"]},"\nThe place now known as Szczecin was first mentioned in written history in 1st century when West-Roman historian Tacitus located East Germanic tribe of Rugians somewhere in the area; the Rugians left in 5th Century during the Great Migration. Sometime in the 8th century Western Slavic tribe of Pomeranians built their stronghold here. In 10th century the town was mentioned as \"one of major in Pomerania\" in Abraham ben Jacob's chronicle. In approximately 1080 its area was incorporated into ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Poland"]]},", but within eight years, the town was controlled by the Dukedom of Pomerania, and five years later, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Denmark"]]},". In 12th century when its competitor, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Wolin"]]}," (also known as Veneta in medieval chronicles) declined Szczecin began to prosper from trade and became one of the major Baltic sea harbours. Its name was first recorded in 1133 as \"Stetin\". \n\nIn 1181 Pomeranian dukes joined Holy Roman Empire. In 1243 Szczecin got city rights before it became member of the Hanseatic League in 1278. Until early 17th century the city was the capital of Pomeranian Dukedom, then in 1630 when local dukes died out it became part of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sweden"]]},",  then Kingdom of Prussia, then for a brief period, due to Napoleon's conquests, the Empire of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["France"]]},". Beginning in the 18th century, the city constituted as a part of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Germany"]]}," and served as the \"port of Berlin\". During World War II the city was hit hard by Allied bombers - city centre, Old Town and industrial areas were totally ruined. After the Soviet forces invaded Nazi Germany in 1945, according to Potsdam Conference agreements Poland annexed all lands up to the Oder river, expelling the native German population and ultimately extending the border to include Stettin. Poland thus gained control of the city.\n\nIn more recent history, the city was (together with ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tricity"]]},") one of the birthplaces of Solidarity movement.\n\nAn unusual feature of Szczecin is its urban planning - many roundabouts and wide avenues. Stettin was rebuilt in 1880's using designs by Georges-Eugene Haussmann, who also did the urban planning for ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Paris"]]},". His design style is still being used for newly-built (or modified) city areas.\n\nThe maritime industry is still strong with a busy port and repair shipyard, as well as being a center of service industries in Poland. Situated near the border between Germany and Poland, Szczecin is sometimes considered one of most liberal Polish cities.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nSzczecin-Goleniów airport (SZZ) ",{"type":"[","value":["http:\/\/www.airport.com.pl\/en\/show\/start-page"]}," is located almost 50 km from the city centre, near Goleniów. \n",{"type":"*","value":[" Ryanair operates daily flights between Szczecin and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["London"]]}," (Stansted), and 2 flights per week to and from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Dublin"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Liverpool"]]},"."]},{"type":"*","value":[" LOT has several flights daily between Szczecin and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Warsaw"]]},".

The ticket costs 28 euros, so one person can travel for ca. 5 euros. The groups often form spontaneously before departure or on the train itself.

Thanks to its location close to the border and direct link with the German motorway system, Szczecin has the best road connection with Western Europe of all Polish cities.\n\nThe main route to Szczecin from Berlin is the E28 (German: A11, Polish: A6). The journey takes about 2 hours, depending on traffic. Note that the German A11 motorway is undergoing continuous improvements, resulting in some disturbances in certain sections. \n\nTravelling by car to and from other parts of Poland can be troublesome - the traffic is pretty heavy, the distances are large and there is a general shortage of motorways. It also takes quite some time - for example, the trip to Gdańsk (350 km) usually takes 4–5 hours, and to Warsaw (520 km along national road no. 10) you need at least 6–7 hours, even if you don't follow the speed limits too strictly. \n\nYou can also reach Szczecin from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Sweden"]]}," (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ystad"]]},") and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Denmark"]]}," (",{"type":"[[","value":[["Copenhagen"]]},") using the ferry connections to and from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Świnoujście"]]},". From there, the journey takes about 1.5 hours, although this road gets completely jammed on summer weekends.

There is also a small viewing deck. Along the way you can see some quite interesting industrial sights in the northern part of Szczecin. \n\nDespite being a restored Soviet-made Meteor, now equipped with new engines, the hydrofoil is the quickest way to get to Świnoujście - it moors at the left (western) bank of the Świna, so the passengers avoid the need to use the ferry.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get around"]},"\nSzczecin is split in two parts (Lewobrzeże and Prawobrzeże) named after their location on banks of Oder (Lewobrzeże = left bank) and Regalica (Prawobrzeże = right bank) rivers.
