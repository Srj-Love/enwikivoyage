You will have to backtrack about a kilometer from the bus stop to get to the museum, which is marked with a large sign. During high season, May-September, it is open 8AM to 6PM, in low season it closes at 3PM. On Mondays there are no guided tours, also there are no films shown. Children under 13 years of age are not allowed.\n\nThe very peaceful and quiet setting of the camp makes it hard at first to comprehend the horrors that took place here, despite the barbed wire and the watchtowers. However, as you enter the barracks and see the pile of shoes from the victims and the exhibitions describing the efficiency and brutality of the Nazi killers, it all starts getting under your skin.\n\nConstruction of the camp began in 1939, before the war started. It was then a civilian internment camp for Poles from the Free City of Danzig (which was under Nazi government). The camp grew during the war, from housing 3,500 prisoners to 57,000. In 1942 it was turned into an international concentration camp, and in June 1944 it was incorporated into the ultimate evil of Hitler's \"Final Solution\". From then on, Stutthof was a pure extermination camp.\n\nThe walk through the camp area ends by the gas chamber and the crematory which were added in 1943. Mobile gas wagons were also used when extra killing capacity was needed. The nightmare in Stutthof claimed somewhere between 65,000 and 85,000 lives before the Red Army liberated the camp in May 1945.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Guesthous Zacisze"],["url=http:\/\/www.zacisze.pomorze.pl\/en\/index.php"],["email="],["address=82-110 Sztutowo ul.Słoneczna 1"],["lat="],["long="],["directions="],["phone=0 506 393 040"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=80zl"],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=A lovely guesthouse run by a young, energetic and welcoming Polish couple.
