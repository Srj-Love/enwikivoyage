Around 80 years after that the eastern immigration started. Immigrants from northern Finland occupied the woods. They survived on hunting, fishing and farming.\n\nIn the 1720s, ironworks wer established in the villages of Strömsdal, Fredriksberg\/Annefors, Ulriksberg and Tyfors.\n\nWhen Sebastian Grave came to the district and looked for a place to establish his ironworks. He was a true contractor and started the works in Gravendal. In 1830 it became the biggest iron producers together with the other works in Dalarna.\n\nMost of the cottages were built in the 18th century and when the ironworks in the beginning of the 1900s turned into a wood industry. The coal and iron crofter became drivers and woodcutters.\n\nA railway was build during the later part of 19th entury to make it easier for the transportations of the iron and later the paperwork’s. In the 1940´s and forward lots of the cottages were demolished or modernised. But some of them were renovated after an old stile and can still be visited.\n\nIn one of these renovated cottages lived a Karl Persson often called Styggen by villager, man with magician knowledge. He was threaded with respect and he also put a spell that nothing will ever grow on his land the day he dies, and witch it doesn’t do still today. The myth also says that if you take something from the land you will get unlucky. \nIf you don’t do the last mentioned, Styggens cottage is still a nice visiting area if you are in Säfsen.\n\nThe iron works had finished and instead a paper industry was built in Fredriksberg that became the dominant nourishment in the parish till 1972. The resources was already there- the woods, the water and not at least the employment. In 1898 a sulphite fabric were build in Fredriksberg and the first pulp were just finished by the time around Christmas. \nNear the “sulphite” a sulphate fabric started and in 1932 later the paper fabric started.\n\nDuring 1940- and 50´s the town of Fredriksberg were blossoming with a lots of different stores -  books, clothing, food, flowering, a little hotel and coffee shops. But there came times when the manufacturing and pulp and paper no longer was pay full. From the 70´s instead there was wooden shelf’s, car springs, wallpapers and laundry that had focus in a couple of years.\n\nThe first lift came in 1979 and was the start on the big venture on tourism and conference activity, that today is Säfsen Resort. The resort is growing today and developing steady. \n\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["Style"]]},"\n;GPS coordinators : Lat: N 60º 7' 56.11\"  Long: E 14º 25' 7.98\"'''\n\nSäfsen is 3 km east of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fredriksberg"]]}," along Road 245. \n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By car"]},"\nFrom ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Stockholm"]]}," it is best to drive towards ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Västerås"]]}," and then continue on Road 66 towards ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Fagersta"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Ludvika"]]},". \n\nFrom southwestern Sweden you should take Road 26 towards [[Mora], past ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Kristinehamn"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Filipstad"]]},".
