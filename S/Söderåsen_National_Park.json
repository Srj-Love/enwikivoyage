Söderåsen national Park was established in 2001 in Klippan and Svalöv locals. It ranges from Skäralids ravine in the north to the south Nackarpsdalen.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nThe basic geological layout is approximately 150 mio. years old. There are few indications that people lived here permanently before the middle ages, when small time farmers moved in. The terrain makes both agriculture and forestry difficult, but parts of Söderåsen still houses some small-time farms (mostly livestock). Forestry was never widespread but in recent times some areas were planted with red spruce which is fast growing and was believed to be more economically attractive for forest owners, but also a tree not native to this area. Since 2001, when the national park was established, planting of red spruce has largely stopped and some areas with red spruce are being replanted with beech and other naturally occuring trees.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Landscape"]},"\nThe landscape is rugged with deep ravines and prominent hilltops. Most is covered with beech forest dotted with other types of trees. Some open areas hold small-scale livestock farms. In some places the walls of ravines are very steep with scree at the bottom - here it can be both extremely dangerous and damaging to the nature to attempt climbing!\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Flora and fauna"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Mushrooms at Kvärkabäcken.jpg"],["thumb"],["Mushrooms at Kvärkabäcken"]]},"\nThe vegetation is dominated by old-growth beech forest intermingled with other broad-leaf trees and small pockets of conifers. Both beech and oak grow to great height, and some of Sweden's tallest broad-leaf trees grow here with heights in excess of 40 meters. Dead tree is left to rot except in very few cases where it may pose an immediate danger to the public, and even along the official paths it may be necessary to pass some huge, old trunk lying as it fell.\n\nThe ravines often are humid in the bottom which makes a good habitat for a number of rare ferns, mosses and liverworts. Söderåsen has a high diversity of mosses and liverworts, and houses a number of species which in Sweden are found only here and very few other places near by. Take extra care not to damage mosses and liverworts, which may look all the same, but are not.\n\nThe abundance of rotting tree also makes the ideal habitat for a great number of fungi, and the ideal home for a large number of beetles.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Climate"]},"\nSöderåsen is part of the Tornquist-zone group of ridges which in Scania forms the border between the mild sub-atlantic climate of Denmark and Northern Germany, and the colder boreal zone predominant in Sweden, Finland and Norway. Rain, mist and fogs are common and may appear and disappear rapidly. Temperature may also change quite a bit from day to day depending on which climatic zone has local dominance, and while the hilltops could be hot and sunny the ravine bottoms can be cold and moist, especially in the morning. Generally the Weather is gentle but hard to predict; make sure to dress in layers if walking longer distances.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["image:Söderåsen near Granliden.jpg"],["thumb"],["300px"],["Forest road in Söderåsen"]]},"\nThe easiest is to get in by car, while walking or cycling are also possible.
