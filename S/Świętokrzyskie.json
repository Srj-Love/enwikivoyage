Great castles and palaces were built in this region during the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth period, and Sandomierz was one of the richest cities due to the flourishing Vistula trade route. After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795 most of its territory was annexed by Austria, but became independent as part of the Duchy of Warsaw between 1807-1815. After the Congress of Vienna it became part of the Kingdom of Poland, ruled by the Russian Tsar. After the WWI Świętokrzyskie became part of the Second Polish Republic, but was occupied by Nazi-Germany between 1939 and 1944, when it was part of the German so-called General Government. After the World War II it again became part of Poland.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["By plane"]},"\n\nThere is no international airport in Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship.
