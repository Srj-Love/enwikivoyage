Unlike Agung, Batukaru is a long extinct volcano and it is forested to the peak. There is none of the desolate, barren beauty of Mount Agung. It is though an interesting climb through some areas of dense primary forest and despite its relatively minor elevation (2,276 m), one which should only be undertaken by the physically fit. \n\nWeather conditions are a critical factor in any climb here. Batukaru is a damp place and it rains for much of the year. This is probably the wettest place in Bali. Do not even think about a climb of Batukaru in the wet season (mid-October to late March), or when rain is forecast. The paths become running streams very quickly here. July and August are the best months.\n\nThere are 3 main ascent routes all of which converge at the same point at Munduk Nyanggang. The start usually depends on where you are staying: Wongayagede, Sarinbuana or Sanda. The Sanda route is the toughest and longest (6 to 7 hours to the top), and the Sarinbuana route the easiest.  From the point of convergence at Munduk Nyanggang, the peak is another 2 to 3 hours of tough climbing depending on your level of fitness and the prevailing weather conditions.\n\nA bonafide guide should always be used and can be arranged through your local hotel or employed directly at Pura Luhur Batukaru. Expect to pay anywhere between Rp 800,000 and 1,000,000 for a good experienced guide for a day return trek. All of the local guides also offer less arduous treks in the local area, including the ascent to Munduk Nyanggang only.\n\nCamping is allowed on the mountain, although there are some restrictions close to Pura Luhur Batukaru during important ceremonies. For enthusiastic outdoors types, there is ample scope here to camp out on the mountain for one or more nights and really explore the area. Ask a guide for some ideas.\n\nThere is no food or water (some stream and spring water is OK, but be careful) for sale on the mountain, so bring in enough with you.  Due to its sacred nature, no beef or beef products are permitted on the mountain and all visitors must respect this.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Buy"]},"\nTabanan itself is a very commercial town and does not have shopping aimed at visitors. \n\nAt any of the main tourist attractions you will find the usual souvenir stalls. \n\nOn the drive from Antosari to Pupuan there are several coffee plantations and processors who offer the chance to purchase freshly roasted beans.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nAll hotels and resorts have their own restaurants attached.\n\nIn Tabanan town there are numerous decent local restaurants and a night market.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nThose visitors who especially enjoy mountain views should stop for an afternoon break and perhaps a cup of coffee on the scenic drive from Antosari to Pupuan.\n\nThe beach resorts at Yeh Gangga are a great spot to enjoy a sunset cocktail.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" ",{"type":"{{","value":[["sleep"],["name=Bali Eco Stay"],["url=http:\/\/www.baliecostay.com"],["email="],["address=Kanciana Village"],["lat="],["long="],["directions=southern slopes of Batukaru, north Tabanan"],["phone=62 81338042326"],["tollfree="],["fax="],["hours="],["price=$US85-210"],["checkin="],["checkout="],["content=Stunning mountain setting where the rice paddies meet the jungle and you can still see the sea.
