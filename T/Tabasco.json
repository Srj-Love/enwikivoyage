Known as the \"Eden of Mexico\", it is a mostly flat state with lush tropical vegetation, wetlands, forests, and enormous rivers, namely the Grijalva and Usumacinta.  The state borders ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Veracruz"]]}," to the west, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chiapas"]]}," to the south, ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Campeche"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Guatemala"]]}," to the east, and the ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Gulf of Mexico"]]}," to the north.  Oil is plentiful along the shoreline and extensive operations are in place to exploit this natural resource.  The inhabitants are called \"Tabasqueño\/as\" in formal contexts, although they often refer to themselves as \"choco\/as\".\n\nTabasco's climate can be summed up in two words: \"hot\" and \"humid\".  The months of November, December, and January are the most comfortable times to visit, with daytime temperatures hovering between 25 to 30 C (77 to 86 F), although dew points will be high nonetheless, making the air still seem sultry for visitors from non-tropical climates.\n\nTabasco is divided into five regions, known as Chontalpa, Centro, Sierra, Pantanos, and Rios.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Talk"]},"\n\nNatives speak a ",{"type":"'''","value":["Caribbean-influenced variety of Spanish"]}," (\"español choco\") somewhat similar to that spoken in Cuba and Puerto Rico and therefore can be very difficult to follow.
