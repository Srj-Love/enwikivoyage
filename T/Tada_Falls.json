It is situated on the border of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Tamil Nadu"]]}," and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Andhra Pradesh"]]},". It is situated around 95 km from ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Chennai"]]},". \n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get in"]},"\nTada is well connected to Chennai via local trains and mofussil buses that head to Chennai from Tirupathi and Nellore. \n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" By Train"]},"Trains from Chennai heading to Sullurpeta from Chennai Central pass via Tada. There is a train every two hours and the last train from Tada to Chennai leaves at 8:30 pm. \n\n",{"type":"*","value":[" By Car"]},"To reach Tada, Cross the Padi junction in Chennai and take the redhills route and join NH-5. Drive for about 60Kms and you will reach Tada town. Before you reach Tada you will cross the AP checkpost. If you are taking taxis, then you will have to shell out permit tax here (Rs.250 for Indica and Ambassador) and it is pretty high for a Tata Sumo or Tempo Traveller. It might be cost effective to take 2 Indica's compared to a Tata Sumo. \n\nOnce you reach Tada, take the left which is right next to the bridge and you will reach Varadiah Palem. Ask the people for directions from here. You have to take a left turn to reach Tada falls and there are absolutely no indications at this point. You can reach this place from Kalahasti too.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Get Around"]},"\nIt was exactly 20 Kms from the Tada to reach the base camp of the Tada falls. Where you can park our vehicles and start trekking. The only way to get around from here is on foot.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Do"]},"\nOnce you have reached Basecamp the trek begins. (Believe me, it is called Base Camp). The total trek distance would be about 10kms to and fro with nearly 4kms in real rocky conditions. From here the mud road begins and if you are on SUV or two wheelers, you can go for another 1km.\n\nJust after 150mts or so, we reached the place where we had to cross a water body. It was just a small stream.\n\nA small word of caution: Don't get excited on seeing the water and get into it with your shoes on. It will become really tough to trek with wet soles. \n\nOnce you cross this small stream the walk continues till you reach a mud-path. Just follow this mud-path and you will first go up the hill and then down the hill. It is quite tricky to follow the path as in some places only rocks are seen and there is absolutely nothing to indicate a path. \n\nKeep walking along the mud-path and you will cross another stream. We sat for about 10mins here as it was really hot. Continue walking on the mud-path and around 30mins later you will reach a Siva Temple. This is the last place where you can sit comfortably and have food, if you haven't had any so far. You can call this BaseCamp 3, if you want to. If you don't reach the Siva temple within an hour and half of starting the trek, then you have lost your way. Use the time tested method of following the stream and proceed. \n\nAfter this point there is no proper path and you have to rely on the direction shown people who are around the Siva Temple. You have to cross the stream and then look for a path. You will find a small clearing and this might help you on the way forward. From here on, the trek starts to become difficult. You encounter rocks and millipedes on those rocks on the way forward. (Remember to listen for the stream from this point on. This would be very helpful.) \n\nSome of the rocks are pretty big and it would help if someone who is a good trekker is around. You have to climb nearly 10ft at times and some of the formations are also difficult. There should be two falls, but only one is found during peak summer before the rains have started.\n\nThe Day is incomplete without a Camera to click the Crystal clear Waters.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Best time to Visit"]},"\nThe ideal time to visit Tada is between August-December when the sun is a little less intense. The worst time is March-June.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["See"]},"\n",{"type":"*","value":[" Pulicat Lake is the second largest brackish â€“ water lake or lagoon in India"]},{"type":"*","value":[" Chengalamma Temple is in Sullurpeta. The temple don't have any doors."]},"\n",{"type":"==","value":["Eat"]},"\nCommercialization of this place hasn't begun as on date. So, it is still a nice spot for trekking without the usual buzz of people and shops surrounding you. There are small cantees and grocery stores at Tada, where you can buy snacks or water. Locally the falls is called \"Ubbalamadugu falls\". Remember this name as it can come in handy if you are lost.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Drink"]},"\nYou can buy water at Tada and do not forget to fill you bottles from the Stream before making the return journey.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Sleep"]},"\nWith limited accommodation available nearby, the nearest place is Sullurpeta, which has very good AC and Non-AC lodges. Staying in the forest beyond sun set is not advised.\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Total Cost"]},"\nTotal cost per person (approx) : 450\/- (includes travelling, lunch, breakfast)\n\n",{"type":"==","value":["Go next"]},"\nKeep around 2:30hrs for the journey back. It will be tiring, so give yourself ample time and also take rest wherever needed. Drinking water becomes a luxury and so you can fill the bottles from the streams. This trek isn't for someone who doesn't enjoy walking on the rocks.\n\nYou can take the same way back to reach Tada village from the Tada Falls. There on you can either take a bus, train or cab back to Chennai or Tirupati.\n\n\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["outlinecity"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["IsPartOf"],["Tamil Nadu South Coast"]]},"\n",{"type":"{{","value":[["no Wikipedia link"]]}]
