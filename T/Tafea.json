The volcano can be climbed up to the rim and provides some stunning photo opportunities. Because of the variability of the eruptions, the local government has created safety levels: Level 0 - Low activity, access to the crater allowed; Level 1 - Normal activity, access to the crater allowed; Level 2 - Moderate to high activity, lava bombs may land beyond the crater rim, access to the crater is closed; Level 3 - Severe activity,  access to the summit zone is closed; Level 4 - Major eruption, all access closed."]},"\nBeware that a few people have been killed by lava bombs in the past.
