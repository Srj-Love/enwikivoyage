(This fact has now disputed by recent historical findings claiming that the event may have actually taken place in Loay, 17 kilometers away.)\n\nTagbilaran was originally part of neighboring ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Baclayon"]]},", and its parish church was one of the six churches of Bohol established by the Jesuits when they came to the island in 1595 to evangelize and convert the natives to Christianity. The town was later split from Baclayon in 1742, when Father Cesar Felipe Doria, Rector of the Jesuits in Bohol, petitioned for the creation of a new town as he believed Baclayon became too large to be administered by a single priest, and the town was dedicated to Saint Joseph the Worker, hence the town was originally called San José de Tagbilaran.  It later became the capital of Bohol in 1854, after the island was made a separate province from neighboring Cebu.\n\nThe town grew throughout both the Spanish and American regimes, and on 1 July 1966, Tagbilaran was elevated to a city by virtue of Republic Act No. 4660.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["Orientation"]},"\n",{"type":"[[","value":[["File:Ph locator bohol tagbilaran.png"],["thumb"]]},"\nTagbilaran is divided into fifteen barangays, which are commonly referred to as \"districts\".
