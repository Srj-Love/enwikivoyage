Many of the Tahitian kids are well into rap and hiphop, performing or practicing in the streets or in public squares. \n\nThe philosophy of the people, 'aita pea pea' (not to worry), truly is the Tahitian way of life. Be patient and polite to them and you will get anything you ask for, including a large smile. They are very warm and welcoming people.\n\nBe aware that your trip to Tahiti may be a one-time but unique experience due to its high price.  Though not legally binding, more and more couples are renewing their marriage vows and will be bedecked in pareus, flowers, shells and feathers. The groom approaches the beach in an outrigger canoe. His bride, carried on a rattan throne, awaits him on the white-sand beach. A spectacular sunset, Tahitian music and dancers add to the ambiance. A Tahitian priest \"marries\" the couple and gives them their Tahitian name and the Tahitian name of their first-born.\n\n",{"type":"===","value":["History"]},"\nThe generally accepted theory states that Polynesians first settled in the Pacific around 4,000 years ago. Using wooden double-hulled sailing canoes lashed together with natural fibers and applying their knowledge of the wind, currents and stars, the first intrepid navigators sailed eastward, settling the central island groups of the Cook Islands and French Polynesia between 500 BC and 500 AD.\n\nOther great expeditions undertaken around 1000 AD established the Polynesian triangle consisting of ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Hawaii"]]}," (to the north), ",{"type":"[[","value":[["Easter Island"]]}," (to the east), Tahiti and her islands (to the west) and ",{"type":"[[","value":[["New Zealand"]]}," (to the south-west.)

The climate is tropical. The average ambient temperature is 80°F (27°C) and the waters of the lagoons average 79°F (26°C) in the winter and 84°F (29°C) in the summer. But do not worry, most resorts and hotel rooms are air conditioned or cooled by ceiling fans.\n\nSummer with a warmer and more humid climate is from November through April, and winter is from May to October, when the climate is slightly cooler and drier. When you step out of the airplane, you'll immediately notice that the air is warm and humid. Consequently, besides your camera and your extra memory cards, do not forget to pack lightweight cotton clothes, sunscreen lotion and a baseball cap or a wide brimmed hat.

It is a rickety public open-air bus with wooden passenger cabins that will stop on the side of the street and serve different cities. Prices are very inexpensive, normally set around 100 to 200 CFP (about US$2) per person and most will end up in the centre of downtown close to the market. Other means of transportation include scooters or private cars. Most rental cars will be stickshift and end up being around 9,000 CFP per day (about US$90). There is a multitude of bikes to rent cheaply.

It now takes about half an hour by catamaran to go from Tahiti to Moorea.\n\nFerries (sometimes combined cargo and pax boats like the Aranui) travel between most islands. Catamarans and ferry boats cross between Tahiti and Moorea several times a day. Schooners and cargo boats serve all the inhabited islands from Papeete. Rotations vary according to the destinations: from three times a week to the Society Islands to once monthly to the Island of Mangareva. \n\nTwo cruise ships\/luxury liners currently ply the islands: the Paul Gauguin, which does a regular 7-day trip around the Societies, with occasional trips out to the Tuamotus, Marquesas and Cook Islands; and the Tahitian Princess which does similar itineraries. A great way to see the islands, unless you're on a tight budget. The Bora Bora Cruises is a more intimate vessel based in the Leeward Islands. Or for more adventure, embark on the Aranui III.

When possible eat here as a meal for two can be had for 30 FPF, which is much less than a hotel meal (plus you get plenty of food).\n\nThe main island dish to try is the \"poisson cru\" (\"raw fish\" in French.) It is a fresh fish marinated with lime juice and coconut mixed with vegetables. Many varieties can be found all over including Poisson Cru Chinois (Chinese style), Poisson Cru Ananas (pineapple style). Parrotfish, ahi, mahi mahi, and other fresh fish are divine in a light sauce made from Tahitian vanilla and coconut milk.

Pricey, but fantastic meals.  Chez Remy definitely hits a 5 star at both meals with a large French menu and best wine and drinks selection, and very friendly, relaxed staff who also spoke perfect English.  The Papaya dessert is beyond delicious.   Plan $28–$45 pp USD.  The Italian restaurant near the Le Meridien entrance is also divine; perfect stone oven baked pizza, divine Anchovie-Caper-Olive Spaghetti.  \n\nTips: get French creamed cheese at breakfast on your crepes.\nAlso, plan for your meals.  Many restaurants don't open until 7PM.  Some of the hotels have multiple restaurants that serve different menus at different times of the day, and changes by day, which made for limited selections and inability to order something you saw the day before.   Some restaurants and businesses on the island close from 12-1:30PM, some until 3PM, which can make shopping and eating on a whim difficult.

Although complying with international standards, the overwater bungalows are decorated in Polynesian-style with the use of pandanus, bamboo and shell light fixtures.

Be advised that the Radisson is quite a way from the airport and is perfect if you want to relax, but makes getting into town difficult (either a limited hotel shuttle or an expensive taxi ride).\n\nFamily hotels are ideal for travellers preferring both simplicity and local experience.
